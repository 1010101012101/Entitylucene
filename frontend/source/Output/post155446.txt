Pinch to zoom broken in Yosemite <body> I had pinch to zoom working fine after installing Yosemite but after a month or so it's stopped working. The setting is enabled in Trackpad  Scroll &amp; Zoom and it seems none of those gestures are working anymore. I can use 4/5 fingers outwards for Expose though.   How can I get the full functionality back?  <answer155449> Not for any of my 6 macs.  Try reinstalling it on a fresh HFS+ formatted HD.  <answer168552> Turn off pinch to zoom in preferences, then turn on again. This has worked for me before. If that doesn't work then doing a reboot will usually fix any and all trackpad issues. Problems after a reboot? Check out the above slightely more extreme ways around the problem..  <answer180372> If you have Ad Block installed..  Turn off Ad Block in Safari's Extensions..   Uncheck and then recheck Pinch to Zoom in Trackpad settings..  Test.. If working now turn Ad Block back on.. and test again  It should now work as normal.  <answer229547> Toggling pinch to zoom in System Preferences worked for me. Had this issue in 10.11.4.  <answer266365> I reconnected my trackpad and it's worked  <comment182851> You might try doing an SMC Reset or zapping the PRAMs of your Mac before reinstalling. Those solve a surprisingly large chunk of the Mac problems I see. <comment182859> Your suggestion for a feature that worked for a month then stopped is to do a complete clean install of the OS? o.O <comment183070> Yeah it's a bit weird. It seems to have started working again on its own, so doing nothing is another alternative. It's possible it only affects a small number of environments. <comment280048> This doesn't say anything that hasn't been said before.
