iCloud systempreferences frozen <body> First I couldn't login iCloud because it kept prompting for me to enter my password. I changed my password and hoped I just could login an resolve this issue.  This issue has evolved now into the situation where the preferences panel keeps hanging (not responding) each time I open it. This is bugging me, because I would like to change other settings on my Macbook, but it doesn't let me change this.  I've tried to disable Wi-Fi in order to fix this problem, as this was a solution written on this Apple thread.  How can I remove my freezing iCloud and log back in without troubles?
