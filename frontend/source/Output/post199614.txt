Change color of the Cmd+Tab app switcher on Yosemite? <body> Is it possible to change the color (specifically, darken) the cmd+tab application switcher on yosemite?  It's hard to see, especially against a white background:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WhfBc.png" alt="light yosemite cmd-tab switcher"  <answer199628> You can darken the the background of menu bars in Yosemite using "Dark mode".  To enable this go to System Preferences--General, and check the box next to "Use dark menu bar and Dock".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zyeXW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment240365> are you using dark mode? <comment240369> Noâ€¦ I didn't even know that was a thing! But that looks like exactly what I want. Thanks!
