After restoring all of my files are sitting under my documents. How can i clean up? <body> I had to erase and reinstall everything on my macbook pro.  I was having issues restoring from timeline so I did a manual copy over from an external hard drive onto my computer.    The issue is that I don't see the Pictures, Music or Movies folders in Finder any more so I just put all of my files inside "My Documents".   I thought that itunes would reorganize my files when i imported everything into itunes but it doesn't seem like it as the machines still thinks i have 200+ GB of documents. (see screenshots) and it doesn't show any movies or music.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uEmmE.png" alt="enter image description here"  So my questions are:  ol lihow can i get these other folders (Music, Movies) to show up in My Finder (on the left side bar)/li liwhat is the "right" place to store my music, pictures, movies (assuming sitting in "My documents" isn't correct/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JFeBd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer254331> You need to go to Finder's preferences, then to the sidebar tab to re-enable folders on the sidebar.   The correct place to put  ul liPictures: Pictures folder /li liiTunes: Music folder/li liVideos: Movies folder/li liDocuments: Documents/li /ul  <comment316611> You can also just drag them into the sidebar. <comment316648> @MacManager yes, but that's assuming the OP can get to their home folder, which they don't seem to know how.
