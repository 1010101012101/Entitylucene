Problem Restoring iPad (iOS 5.1.1) <body> I'm having trouble restoring my iPad running iOS 5.1.1. I forgot my passcode and tried restoring the iPad but it ran out of power, since then it has failed to power on.  <answer242882> Take it to a Genius Bar and see if they can help. There's not much else to be said.
