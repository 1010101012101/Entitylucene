Filesystem permissions for /var/mobile/Media/DCIM/.MSIC/Incoming <body> I have changed the permissions on code/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/.MSIC/Incoming/code. Now my camera cannot take pictures. Maybe picture is taken but it cannot write it. I want to fix the permissions issue. Could somebody tell me what the permissions should be (iPhone 5s iOS 8.1)?  <answer196716> The permissions on directories in code/var/mobile/code are codedrwxr-xr-x/code (code755/code).  <comment225343> Try sudo chmod -R 770 directory/goes/here
