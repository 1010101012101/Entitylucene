Environment variable for Apple Shake 4.1 <body> Where is Shake's environment variable located in Mac OS X allowing to launch Shake.app via Terminal session in El Capitan, Yosemite or Mavericks?   There's no Shake's variables in code~/.bash_profile/code, code/etc/profile/code and code/etc/bashrc/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SGjqu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer295110> You're able to access the codeshake/code command line tool because it's in a directory that's listed in the codePATH/code environment variable in your environment.  If you want to know the precise location of the codeshake/code executable you can type:  precodewhich shake /code/pre  Which will list the first place it finds the codeshake/code executable when it searches all the directories in the codePATH/code environment variable.  If you want to see all the places codeshake/code exists you can type:  precodewhich -a shake /code/pre  And that will list all of the places where a command called codeshake/code can be found. I don't have codeshake/code on my machine, but here's an example using codebash/code. The first occurence of the codebash/code executable for me:  precodeIanCsiMac:~ &gt; which bash /usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  And all the places I can find a codebash/code executable in my codePATH/code:  precodeIanCsiMac:~ &gt; which -a bash /usr/local/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash /code/pre  And my codePATH/code variable looks like this:  precodeIanCsiMac:~ &gt; perl -e 'print join("\n", split(/:/,$ENV{"PATH"}))' /Users/ian/.gem/ruby/2.3.1/bin /Users/ian/.rubies/ruby-2.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/bin /Users/ian/.rubies/ruby-2.3.1/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin /Users/ian/google-cloud-sdk/bin /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/bin /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin /usr/local/MacGPG2/bin /usr/local/mysql/bin /Users/ian/bin /opt/nginx/sbin /opt/local/bin /opt/local/sbin /Users/ian/Development/go/bin /code/pre  <answer295111> Bash command strongcodewhich shake/code/strong gives me the following result:  precode/usr/bin/shake /code/pre  And the content of the strongcodeshake/code/strong file in strongcode/usr/bin//code/strong contains a script like this:  precode# set env var, NR_SHAKE_LOCATION if not set  if ${?NR_SHAKE_LOCATION} == 0 then     pushd `dirname $0` &gt;&amp; /dev/null     setenv NR_SHAKE_LOCATION /Applications/Shake     popd &gt;&amp; /dev/null endif  # launch shake  exec ${NR_SHAKE_LOCATION}/shake.app/Contents/MacOS/shake $argv:q /code/pre
