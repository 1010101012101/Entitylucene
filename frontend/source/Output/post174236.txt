When does the fan in Apple's Thunderbolt Display go on / get noticeable? <body> When and why might the fan in Apple's Thunderbolt Display become noticeable? I am assuming the display is working correctly and not faulty.  I'm "fighting" to have a low noise notebook, so I don't want to be disturbed by the display fan.  <comment205139> What do you mean by "We're talking well behaving displays here, not misbehaving ones."?
