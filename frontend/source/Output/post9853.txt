Add big green check mark to Keynote presentation <body> I'm using Keynote '09 for the first time, and I find myself wanting some bits of clip art or additional shapes. At the moment, I just want a big check mark. It's hard to believe that this isn't provided, but I can't find it.  <answer9858> Keynote doesn't really come with clip art. It is easy, however, to add images.  I did a Google Images search for codecheck mark/code, and set the color to green. Here are the results (there are many good images).  To add the image to Keynote, click See Full Size Image and click-and-drag it to your slide.  Enjoy!  <answer12133> Most fonts have a check mark dingbat. In a text box, type in option v to see it. Then change the color to green like you would any other text.   For additional clip at, look at the dingbat fonts already be installed on your system. Some common ones are webdings, wingdings and zapf dingbats.  <comment80640> Depending on the image, this might be a copyright violation. For example, some of the images in your list are from photography providers such as iStockphoto. Depending on the use case of the presentation, this might be important to know. <comment286869> that's not a check mark, it's a square root symbol
