How to proceed with iOS set up without Wi-Fi network? <body> I have just restored my iPhone 4 to iOS 5 factory settings but it requires a Wi-Fi network although I do not have a wireless access point in or around my house.  Can I not use the iOS 5 without a Wi-Fi connection?  <answer27713> Yes, you can, set it as a new iPhone or restore your contents from iTunes backup in your computer by tethering your iPhone with iTunes.  <comment31783> It makes no difference. I still have to go through the same steps in my iPhone after setting as a new iPhone on iTunes. And the "restore from backup" option is telling that a session could not be started for some reason. <comment31785> Is it because I am using an IPSW file rather than downloading it through iTunes?
