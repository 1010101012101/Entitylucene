Mountain Lion and Server 2008 Home Folder Directories <body> We're looking to move to 10.8 within our organisation and in the past have had issues with the way we would ideally like our home folders to work. With 10.6 we had a script that ran and allowed us to mount a link to the users home folder on the desktop. This home folder is located within a share on a Windows Server 2008 server with the following structure Share\Username\My Documents.  It's my understanding from testing that in 10.8 we cannot map directly to the My Documents folder like we used to. We only seem to be able to access the share and not folders within it. The instructions to link to the folder per user are set within Profile Manager on the Mac server.  I've had a look about and most sites seem to confirm my suspicions but I thought I'd ask here in case anybody has been able to find a way to get it to work!
