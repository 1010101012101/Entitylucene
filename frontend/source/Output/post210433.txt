Mail.app crashes after update to El Capitan OS <body> Apple Mail app crashes for me nonstop after I updated to El Capitan. Every time just a one or two right after opening.  I started to have this problem right after I installed El Capitan to clean HD and migrated within Migration assistant my old account and settings (everything except of applications).  Would be nice if someone could help me with that..Thank you!

It's seems to have been related to the fact that I have multiple email accounts active in the app, as many people do.  The initial download of all messages from all accounts seemed to be overloading the app, causing it to crash.  See if this works for you:  ol liBefore opening the Mail app, turn off your wifi connection (prevents mail from trying to download mailboxes from all accounts at once)./li liLaunch Mail app and go to Mail - Preference - Accounts tab./li liClick each of your accounts on the left side of the Accounts window, then uncheck the box next to "Enable this account."  Disable all of your mail accounts./li liClose Preference and close the Mail app./li liRelaunch the mail app and reconnect to wifi./li liGo back to Mail - Preferences - Accounts tab, and enable the first account.  Give the app plenty of time to download all messages until you no longer see "Checking for Mail..." at the bottom left of the app screen (may take a few minutes depending on how many messages you have on the server)./li liOnce the app is no longer "Checking for Mail..." repeat this server for each of your other accounts.  I saved Gmail until last since it's my biggest, which took the longest - about 5 minutes (I use multiple Gmail accounts)./li /ol  After enabling all accounts, the crash issue stopped for me.  Hope it works for you!  <comment262704> Any feedback whether this works? <comment267190> See also: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/201201/why-wont-apple-mail-open-after-install-of-os-x-el-capitan-10-11-any-ideas (- the one that helped me) <comment267191> @okiharaherbst For me it does not work. But the one in: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/201201/why-wont-apple-mail-open-after-install-of-os-x-el-capitan-10-11-any-ideas does. <comment281812> Worked for me, albeit in my case Mail was crashing whenever I've tried to open Preferences. The key point was to disconnect from network and relaunch.
