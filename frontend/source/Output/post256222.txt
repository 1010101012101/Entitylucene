Multiple vpns don't connect <body> I set up two different vpn connections and when I successfully connect to the first vpn and want to connect to the second one, first one disconnects and both vpns doesn't establish. Could you please help me to connect two vpns at the same time? Why the first vpn disconnects?  <comment319503> Welcome to Ask Different.  There seems to be a lot of detail missing from this question like what device you are using, what VPN client/service you are using, etc.  Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder; more details are helpful.
