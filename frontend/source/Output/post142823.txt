Cannot send invitation in iOS Developer program <body> I want to invite someone as team member to the iOS developer program. I tried codeInvite Person/code and codeBulk Invite/code but the codeSend Invitation/code button has always  precode&lt;a id="submitBtn" class="button right " onclick="return(false);"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Send Invitation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre  Everything has been filled out but I cannot send the invitation. What is the problem here?  It is the same problem as described here. Haven't received a response from Apple yet ...  <answer156012> When you fill the invitation form, you must specify emboth/em strongiOS Developer Program/strong emand/em strongSafari Developer Program/strong access type. So if you forget to set Safari Developer Program to "No access" for instance, the button "Send Invitation" stays disabled.   <answer159101> Select No Access on Safari Developer Program. You must select an option for Safari Developer Program even if it doesn't matter to you.  <answer191815> The solution I took was to use another e-mail address. One of the reason could be that I already had an account associated with that e-mail address. Or the name of the e-mail address was too long so that the regex failed. Don't know.  <comment183521> Hmmm, currently I'm not enrolled in the Safari Developer Program. The solution I took was to use another e-mail address. One of the reason could be that I already had an account associated with that e-mail address. Or the name of the e-mail address was too long so that the regex failed. Don't know. But thanks for your input. I'll give it a try the next time.
