MacBook Keychain problems <body> Had a new MacBook at Christmas linked to iCloud password.   Forgot iCloud password so Apple reset it for me. I can login to MacBook using new iCloud password now but Keychain won't allow me to open Local Items keychain says password is incorrect I guess it wants old password that I forgot.   Please help?  <answer222071> Yup, you can't unlock that without the old password that locked it.  <answer222077> Try this:  ol liOpen KeyChain app/li liLock the Keychain by clicking the lock on the top left corner, if it isn't already./li liUnlock the Keychain using your Admin Password. Reset iCloud KeyChain (it may ask you to automatically - if so, say yes. If not. If not, do it manually)./li liRestart computer./li /ol  See if that works.
