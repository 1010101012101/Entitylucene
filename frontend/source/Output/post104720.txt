Update to Apple TV 6.0 has stopped certain movies from being shown from my itunes <body> After updating to the latest Apple TV software 6.0 certain seemingly random movies are now no longer available. These are all movies from my iTunes library that I ripped myself.  I can't see why its discriminating one over the other. Are there new rules for what it now shows?  They were all ripped using Handbrake (Apple TV 3 preset, mp4) and always worked before.  Also these missing movies are available to stream to my iPhone 4s and iPad 2.  Really weird, any help is appreciated.  <answer104732> I figured it out. I've made a blog post about it to help anyone with the same issues:  Apple TV 6.0 missing movies
