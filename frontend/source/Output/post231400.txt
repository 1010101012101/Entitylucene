Edit (colorized) terminal output before printing? <body> A very similar question has already been asked on SuperUser but none of the answers works satisfactorily for me.  I can actually get emalmost/em what I want by simply:  ol liRunning the Terminal for the whole session with the terminal width that I want to appear in the printed output, and/li liUsing Command-P (⌘-P) to print the terminal scrollback history (including colors!) to PDFwriter./li /ol  However, I can't then strongedit the terminal scrollback history before printing/strong.  If I save the Terminal Saved Output with ⌘-S, I can edit the text, but it is plaintext only—no colors.  I want to use this printing capability to create correctly colorized example output PDFs demonstrating the correct use of command line tools, so it is important that I be able to edit the scrollback history for clarity.  For instance, if I make a typo halfway through a long demonstration, I don't want the mistake to appear in the PDF to confuse students/readers, but I also don't want to restart the demonstration.  Really I would like to be able to add page breaks at specific points, and have page numbering.  But at the very least I must be able to edit the text before it is turned into a PDF.  How can I do this on Mac OS X?  (I'm running Lion, 10.7.4.)  <answer231405> Before starting your session, run the command codebash | tee stdout.rtf/code. This starts a new bash session, recording the output in a file codestdout.rtf/code. Now, simply edit codestdout.rtf/code and print.  <comment282616> This doesn't work.  (a) The command output isn't displayed to my terminal, only the prompts are displayed; (b) The commands I type aren't entered into the file; (c) The command output is not in color. <comment282619> I fixed it, it should work now! <comment282620> Better, but [still no colors](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3515392/5419599).  You can't do it just with redirection. <comment282662> try copying (m4-a m4-c) your terminal and paste it into a text editor that supports color. mod4 is normally the apple key.
