iPad App -- Mirror Video over Bluetooth? <body> I'm looking for a very specific iOS app. A universal app would be preferable, but iPad only would be fine. I'm looking for the ability to control one or more device's video playback from another device, over Bluetooth. I will not have Wi-Fi available. I've searched around and found some apps similar to what I would like, such as Xavier (expensive and few ratings on iTunes) and Electric Slide (which only allows two devices to connect over Bluetooth at a time). Does anyone have any possible solutions?  Thank you!
