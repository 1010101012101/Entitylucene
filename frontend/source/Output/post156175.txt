Are my wireless Microsoft mouse+keyboard supported in OSX? <body> I have a MS Wireless Laser Mouse/Keyboard 5000 set where both connect to my Windows desktop using a special USB bluetooth receiver.  I'm not sure if this is generic USB technology that will work on my Mac Mini (2012), running OSX Yosemite - I am hoping to switch to that as my main device.  Can anyone tell me if it will/should work without problems?  <answer156177> Yeah, even Microsoft itself says it's compatible with OSX !   <answer156178> Judging from MS driver download sites http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/wireless-mouse-5000 &amp; http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/p/wireless-comfort-desktop-5000#support they will be natively supported in anything newer than 10.7.  If not, try those drivers.
