Can a Time Capsule provide ethernet connection via wifi? <body> So, I have a Time Capsule 802.11n (3rd Gen) and I'd like it to connect to an existing wifi and provide internet connection through its ethernet ports.  I reset it, set "add to a network" and it seems it successfully connected to the wifi, because I can see it via the Airport Utility (I am connected to the same wifi).  But if I try to connect via its ethernet, it doesn't work. I also tried a manual configuration:  precodeip: 192.168.1.25 mask: 255.255.255.0 gw: 192.168.1.1 /code/pre  but it doesn't work.. I get no internet if I connect to the TC with the ethernet (tried pinging code8.8.8.8/code)  In the settings I have this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2elJA.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is it possible to achieve what I want with a Time Capsule and a traditional router (without WDS mode)?  <comment364062> Duplicate of https://superuser.com/questions/325170/how-to-use-a-time-capsule-as-a-wireless-bridge
