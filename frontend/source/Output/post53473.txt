how to convert an html page to pdf using javascript? <body> I have an html page, I want to convert it into pdf format to make it printer friedly. I was restricted to use either javascript or js libraries to complete this task. Could any one please help me..!!!  <answer53474> You don't need JavaScript. Just visit http://pdfcrowd.com and you'll be able to convert your HTML to PDF.   Or are you looking for something you can implement in your own HTML pages so your users can print PDF's from your content? If this is the case, you should ask your question on Stackoverflow!  <answer53496> Not sure if JavaScript can really do it, from what I read it can't.  But it looks like jsPDF may prove me wrong.  <comment61158> This is not Apple related, you may be better served at StackOverflow. And even there, nobody will do your homework for you...
