Shortly after doing that AVG shows up again in activity monitor./li liI went to terminal and typed in coderm -rf/code hit return and then dragged the application to terminal. Once it showed me the path of the file I hit delete. Then terminal came back and said (-bash: /Applications/AVG AntiVirus.app: is a directory)/li /ol  How the heck do I delete AVG AntiVirus on my computer?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Hl6N.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer242611> You need to properly uninstall AVG AntiVirus for Mac first.
