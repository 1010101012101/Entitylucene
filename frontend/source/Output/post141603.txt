How can I restore an older version of a Numbers document (before the sync) <body> I'm using Numbers on my iPad and my Macbook.  Yesterday I opened my Macbook and for some reason it opened the Numbers app but didn't sync. I didn't really need to work on the file so I just left it open. A few hours later I wanted to do some work on my iPad. It prompted me with a "there's a newer version on your Macbook" and asked me if I want to sync to that version. I actually forgot I didn't do any work on my computer and tapped on the sync button.  Now I lost all of the information since before the sync.  How can I restore the older version on the iPad - before the sync?
