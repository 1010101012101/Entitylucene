Can one install Automator .workflow services via Terminal without user consent? <body> I know I can just use codeopen/code command on these files to run them and the user will be prompted with an option to install them. Can I install such services silently though?  <answer250299> Moved the Automator services to code$HOME/Library/Services//code instead of installing them.  <comment310702> You can use cp, mv, or ditto to move or copy the file. <comment310703> @IronCraftMan and copy it to the default automator library? Hm. Does that operation do the same as service 'installation'? <comment310704> I don't know, and I can't test it at the moment, but you can. I'd assume there is no difference. <comment310705> @IronCraftMan This is elegant and simple. Thank you!
