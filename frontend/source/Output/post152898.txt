BootCamp, can't partition SSD <body> I've upgraded my OS X to the latest Yosemite GM Candidate and cannot for the life of me figure out how to partition my SSD for BootCamp. Here are some screenshots of the problem:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iznOt.png" alt="enter image description here"  And when i try to partition from Disk Utility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXkvJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is the problem and can it be solved? I read somewhere something about needing to wipe my hard drive and start over with a fresh OS X install, but i really would prefer not to do that, any help is appreciated. Thanks.  P.S: I've tried verifying disk permissions, and repairing in recovery mode. Nothing worked.

Goto System Preferences-Security &amp; Privacy-Filevault, hit the lock icon on the bottom left and enter your login credentials, push the button labeled Turn Off File Vault, after confirming, you should see a progress bar showing the status of the drive decryption. Once the drive is completely decrypted you can resize the partitions.   This will completely decrypt your drives data, so once you are satisfied with your new partition setup and commit them to disk, go ahead and turn file vault back on. Also note the decryption process is not quick, it make take over a day. Hope this helps.  <answer153079> This Mac Book Retina was originally delivered with Mountain Lion. The upgrade history contains Mavericks, several Yosemite DPs and finally the Yosemite GM Candidate.  One of the Yosemite Developer Previews transformed the previous codeApple_HFS partition/code into a codeLogical Volume Group/code.  The (only) Logical Volume is not revertible:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vtpL8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The Boot Camp assistant can't modify the partition map and shrink such a LVG to free up some unallocated space for a Windows installation on a hard disk.  The only possibility (we found) to solve the problem is a complete reinstall:  ol liBackup all your data/li liDisconnect all external hard drives/li liRestart into codeInternet Recovery Mode/code by pressing kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbdbr (alternatively you may use a Mavericks or Mountain Lion Install Thumb Drive)/li listart codeTerminal/code from the menubar/utilities/li lienter following command at the Terminal prompt:      diskutil cs list /li liCopy the Logical Volume Group (LVG) alphanumeric UUID of your CoreStorage volume. The LVG UUID should be the first listed. In the above example the alphanumeric is:br 312C0A5B-AC3E-4008-895F-6EDFDD386825./li liRun the following command:       diskutil cs delete UUID     According to the number found above it would be:       diskutil cs delete 312C0A5B-AC3E-4008-895F-6EDFDD386825     This will delete your CoreStorage volume and your Recovery HD and reformat it as a simple HFS+ volume.  /li liQuit codeTerminal/code/li liIn the now opening window choose codeDisk Utility/code and format/partition/rename the internal drive. Choose code1 Partition/code, codeMac OS Extended (Journaled)/code and GUID partition table (available with the codeoption/code button).

Starting into codeRecovery Mode/code at step 3 doesn't help because it's impossible to delete the LGV then.  <answer154233> OP, you can run the following command "diskutil cs revert" in Terminal. It will non-destructively revert Yosemite's unnecessary CoreStorage volume setup into a "normal" (non-CoreStorage) setup. I had to run in on a few of the dev previews. You may have to run it as root.   <answer205880> @klanomath answer is like killing a mosquito with a surface to air missile (SAM) that cost an arm and a leg.  The problem is simple: there is an error in your disk. I had the same issue, exactly. I will recommend you first check if there are errors on your disk, repair it and try Boot Camp once again.  How to Check for Errors and Repair your HD:     First, you have to shut down your Mac. Then, turn it on and   immediately hold down Command + S to enter Single User Mode. Now, type   in the following code into the command prompt interface:      /sbin/fsck -fy      Then, press Enter on your keyboard. That command checks and repairs   inconsistencies in file systems that might prevent you from   partitioning your drive. Once that has been completed, type in this   code:      reboot      Hit Enter and your Mac will restart as usual.      Now, try running Boot Camp Assistant again to install Windows. You   should not receive the previous error and will be able to run the   installation without any hiccup.   Reference: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/bootcamp-assistant-cannot-partition/  90% of the time, this will work. If it doesn't, you can then order for SAM from Lockheed Martin on Northrup Grumman by following the advice of @klanomath  <comment180022> please do a 'diskutil list' & 'diskutil cs list' with Terminal.app and add the output to your question. Yosemite GM or Release? <comment180024> @klanomath Yosemite GM, the latest Update provided by apple. I also tried this with the release, however same result. <comment180025> @klanomath I've added the diskutil command output to the question. <comment180029> disk2 is a thumb drive with Win7/8/8.1? <comment180030> Windows 7. It's 8GB and has the Bootcamp installed windows support software. Ready to boot from once i have a windows partition made. <comment180035> Do you have a time machine backup? <comment180036> no, but i could make one <comment180042> i think the problem is: 'Revertible: No' (4th line from below) in the diskutil cs list output. With a yes it would be easy probably <comment180045> Ok, well i don't mind just wiping the disk, no important files are on here that i need. Do i need to format the HD or something similar? <comment180051> in my eyes the core storage item (Logical Volume Group etc) prevents the creation of the 2nd (boot camp) partition. I'm just reading a lengthy thread related to that: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1741742 <comment180053> Ah, what if i downgraded to an OS X version that doesn't use core storage, made the partition, then upgraded? <comment180054> Before erasing the disk i would try: 'diskutil cs revert disk1' in the terminal app. Do you have a second computer to visit apple.stackexchange? <comment180055> Yes i do, just tried the revert command:   *Started CoreStorage operation on disk1 Macintosh HD Error: -69666: This Core Storage operation is not allowed on a sparse logical volume group* <comment180056> a successful operation may take 3-5 minutes then restart the mac and enter 'diskutil list' and Apple_CoreStorage should be replaced by Apple_HFS <comment180057> We need a chat room ;-) <comment180058> Should we move it to chat <comment180059> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/18150/discussion-between-klanomath-and-thatguy343). <comment180060> Successful operation of reverting? <comment180076> No, according to the asker file vault never was enabled: "Encryption Type: None" <comment180148> Is your SSD an Apple Fusion Drive? <comment180149> @klanomath You are correct, I incorrectly assumed from a quick glance at the partition scheme the op was using File Vault. Apparently Yosemite creates a core storage volume by default even though it may not be needed for anything. My answer is not relevant to the op's question. <comment180377> :) thank you again, this all worked perfectly and i now have 2 partitions (pc,mac). <comment180379> SSD, but this was resolved. <comment188915> I had a similar though not identical issue as the questioner. I could partition my drive in Disk Utility but Bootcamp could do nothing with it, not even remove the partition I created. This ultimately solved the issue I was having. <comment290900> This worked perfectly for me, thanks so much!
