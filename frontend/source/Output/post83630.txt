Create a Terminal command to open file with Chrome <body> I want to create command in terminal that would allow me to use  precodechrome index.html /code/pre  and have the the given file open in Google Chrome.  How can I get this working?  <answer83632> You can use the open command with the code-a/code flag to open a file or location in Chrome:  precodeopen -a "Google Chrome" index.html /code/pre  This also works with URLs, emi.e./em codeopen -a "Google Chrome" http://www.apple.com/code.  <answer238586> I found this way more beautiful:   ol liEdit code~/.bash_profile/code file and add the following line codealias chrome="open -a 'Google Chrome'"/code/li liSave and close the file./li liEither run codesource ~/.bash_profile/code or open a new window in Terminal./li /ol  You can now open the file, file.html, by running: codechrome file.html/code on the command line.  <comment96277> I'm not near a Mac, so this is untested. You'll need the full path to Chrome's executable i.e. something like /Applications/Chrome/MacOS/Chrome followed by the HTML file's full path. All of this assumes the Chrome executable accepts command line argument. <comment96286> You can also make it just like in the question using alias: alias chrome='open -a "Google Chrome"' chrome index.html <comment96405> Yes, but that needs to be set in your bash profile or similar, otherwise it will go away once you close your Terminal session. <comment291898> good answer. do you know how to do the same but instead opening in a new Chrome window? <comment324191> On MacOS (OS X) you could write this in terminal:  open -a "/Applications/Google Chrome.app" index.html
