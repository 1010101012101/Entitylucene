memtester hangs in single user mode <body> Trying to test as much of my 8 GB of RAM as possible with codememtester/code, I encountered a hangup in single user mode, but not when running codememtester/code on my admin user account.  codevm_stat/code is used to calculate the maximum number of bytes codememtester/code is going to mlock (see below).  If codePages inactive/code and codePages speculative/code are removed from the calculation, code/memtester/code (see below) works in single user mode as well.  Any ideas why code/memtester/code with maximum number of bytes hangs in single user mode?   Does code/memtester/code hang on your Mac in single user mode as well?  Thanks!  precode# my memtester setup (iMac running Mac OS X 10.6.8)  # set kernel to 64 bit [[ $(systemsetup -getkernelbootarchitecturesetting) != *x86_64* ]] &amp;&amp;      sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64 # reset kernel to 32 bit with:  # sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386  # get memtester # http://pyropus.ca/software/memtester/ # requires MacPorts, http://www.macports.org/install.php sudo port install memtester     # cat /memtester echo ' #!/bin/bash n1=$(vm_stat | awk '\''BEGIN{sum = 0;} /Pages free|Pages inactive|Pages speculative/{sub(/\.*$/,""); sum+=$NF} END{print sum}'\'') n2=$(getconf PAGESIZE) bytes=$((n1 * n2)) /opt/local/bin/memtester ${bytes}B 2 ' | sudo tee /memtester  sudo chmod +x /memtester   # works on my admin user account sudo /memtester   # hangs in single user mode (computer started with cmd-s keys pressed) /memtester  ... want 7797MB (8176353280 bytes) got  7797MB (8176353280 bytes), trying mlock ...    # &lt;--- memtester hangs here in single user mode #      press ctrl-c repeatedly or the power button #      for at least 5 seconds to abort /code/pre
