Typing into Safari on iPad extremely slow <body> We have an iPad mini 2 running iOS 9. Ever since upgrading, any text field in Safari is empainfully/em slow, generally taking 2 to 4 seconds before responding, and then doing so in fits and jerks. This does not appear to happen anywhere else that I have seen.  I'd like to fix this, but I'm not sure where to start. There do not appear to be any Safari extensions, so it seems to have something with the Safari install itself. Is there any way to do a clean re-install Safari.  <answer228477> If you are only running iOS 9 or 9.1, upgrade to the latest version, iOS 9.2.1. This version improved performance on older devices. If you do happen to be running this version, I would suggest restoring the device and emnot/em restoring from a backup such as iCloud or iTunes.   <answer268709> Go to settingssafari and uncheck open new tabs in background. Sorted.  <comment278579> *sigh* I was *sure* I was running 9.2.1, but it was 9.2. The upgrade immediately solve the problem. <comment278580> Great! Glad that helped. @MauryMarkowitz <comment278751> I should point out it's still slow, just not *as* slow. Useable at least. <comment278752> If it continues to be very slow, I would suggest restoring it. @MauryMarkowitz <comment337436> Welcome to Ask Different.
