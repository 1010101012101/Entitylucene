Fastest and safest way to copy massive data from one external drive to another <body> I need to be able to copy about 2TB of data from an external drive (single USB external disk) to a another external drive (Drobo attached via Firewire).  Finder is not an option. If it hits any problem, it stops the process and I have to figure it out why it failed and start over. Could take me months to get through it.  I've read about CP and RSYNC but I'm not too familiar and I'm afraid I might get some of the switches wrong and miss files, or screw up the file dates, or worst...  Can anyone suggest how I might pull this off with minimum risk and cost?  Thank you.  <answer117469> remote sync, rsync, is a reliable choice for copying large amounts of data. You can prepare the command and perform a dry-run before committing to the copy; add code--dry-run/code to simulate the copy.  Your final command will be fairly simple:  precodesudo rsync -vaE --progress /Volumes/SourceName /Volumes/DestinationName /code/pre  The flags are:  ul licodev/code increases verbosity./li licodea/code applies archive settings to mirror the source files exactly, including symbolic links and permissions./li licodeE/code copies extended attributes and resource forks (OS X only)./li licodeprogress/code provides a count down and transfer statistics during the copy./li /ul  codesudo/code, is used to ensure codersync/code has appropriate rights to access and read all files on your drive regardless of owner. This also allows codersync/code to write the files to the new drive recreating the original owner information.  codersync/code is likely the best choice because it can be rerun in case of problems, offers detailed logging, and is as fast as can be while remaining safe.  There are numerous guides for getting the most from codersync/code, rsync command examples provides relevant examples. As @GordonDavisson comments below, take care with the trailing slashes; these can make a world of difference if your copy starts with a folder.  Alternative tools include codeditto/code and codecp/code. Both very reasonable choices but offering differing syntax.  <answer117497> I answered a similar question here a while back.  My answer is copied below.  hr  I use codecp -Rfv sourcefile destinationfile/code with success on a pretty regular basis.  codecp/code = copy  codeR/code = maintains file hierarchies  codef/code = if  an  existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again  codev/code = verbose mode, displays files transferred as it progresses  codesourcefile/code = data you want to copy  codedestinationfile/code = directory/drive you want to copy to  <answer202201> I used bittorrent sync to sync 8TB between my Drobo and QNAP.  <answer215311> If you don't want to go the command line route, I use the FreeFileSync app  routinely to sync 2 TB of data from an external array to a network location without issue.  You can control how it handles errors and get a log when its complete.    <comment231781> It's worth noting however that cp will recopy files even if they haven't changed whereas rsync will not waste time copying files that already exist on the target. Thus you can restart from where you left off and/or do incremental copying. <comment256753> bittorrent sync is a way to do this as well. The downvotes are (in my opinion) not realy needed. <comment325958> Does the example command properly handle transfers of Time Machine backups? <comment325959> @SwisherSweet you should consider [asking a new question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask). In the mean time, follow Apple's advice for [transferring a Time Machine back-up](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202380). <comment326716> OSX comes with an outdated version of rsync which does not support all the switches that the GNU version has. There is a more modern version in homebrew which can be installed with `brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/rsync.rb` <comment334849> @CousinCocaine yeah, but the question was about how to do something, not what app to use. <comment335163> `Error: bad URI(is not URI?): https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/rsync.rb Please report this bug:   https://git.io/brew-troubleshooting` :(
