This movie requires QuickTime, which is not supported by this version of iTunes. iTunes 12.0.1.26 in Yosemite <body> Rented a movie from iTunes. Tried to play it. Got error: "This movie requires QuickTime, which is not supported by this version of iTunes."  Movie is 720p HD mp4.  Have tried to open the movie in QuickTime but won't open. I suspect that's a DRM issue but QuickTime isn't saying.  I'm not sure if it's related or not but once the download completed I got an iTunes error (We could not complete your iTunes Store request. An unknown error occurred (3001)).  Has anyone else seen this lately? Anyone have any ideas?  James  <answer163021> Found the answer here: http://support.apple.com/en-us/TS3771 Basically, you need to get iTunes to startup in 32-bit mode.   <comment190846> I wish it were so. Unfortunately tried that before posting. That solution appears to have worked in previous iTunes version (going back to 10.4, I guess) but now iTunes says it requires 64-bit mode.
