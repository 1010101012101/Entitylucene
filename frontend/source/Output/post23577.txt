How Many Genius Mixes Are There in iTunes? <body> Every so often I'll add a couple hundred new songs to my iTunes and discover a new mix has been created. It makes me wonder then, exactly how many mixes are there, what genres are they, etc.  Here's a photo, in case you're unsure what I'm talking about.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TPfoY.png" alt="http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT3843/HT3843--genius_mixes-001-en.png"  <answer23658> Most macs with screens less than 27 inches get a maximum of 12 Genius Mix playlists if you have genius turned on in the view.  There are clearly more than 50 genres on the iTunes store and I've easily seen more than 20 mixes on various people's libraries. I'm not sure if Apple has disclosed how this is curated or how many categories are possible at any point in time.  You can remove a certain list to make room for another Mix by right-clicking on an existing mix icon. As you add more music and the genius updates, you may get a new mix when it can identify enough music in one of the mix categories.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pPQEw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer23660>    We can crowd source this:      ol   liPlease type very carefully. Don't split combinations that use "&amp;" or   "/"- just list them as you see them. Do remove the word "Mix" from the   end./li   liIf you have Brit Pop and Brit Pop 2, add in ( 2 ) or ( 2 3 ) if   you have more than one mix with the same name./li   /ol   These mixes have been observed already "in the wild."  ul liAcoustic Blues/li liAdult Alternative/li liAdult Alternative Pop/li liAdult Alternative Rock/li liAdult Contemporary/li liAdult Pop/Rock/li liAlt.

Maybe this question could be turned into a community wiki, resulting into a complete list of mixes names ? <comment26455> You know what? That's a great idea kraymer and it looks like bmike already got started on it. <comment26461> Why on earth would you want to remove the best mix in your list? It has **Phish** in it! <comment26474> This seems like a great place for a community wiki answer and a normal, well presented question. :-) I love seeing some non-U.S. genres filling up the community answer. <comment26479> Are these mixes actually "curated" or is it just a clever algorithm that combines stuff at random/in the best mix for you? If the latter, there's possibly an infinite number of mixes. And I suspect that's likely to be the case, since Genius is all about automagic matching. <comment26481> That's what I was trying to find out, so I'm holding off on giving bmike the answer, until enough time has passed. I like the idea of having a list of Mixes, but if anyone has a more detailed answer as to how it works, I'd be down for that too. <comment26482> I wonder if some of the mixes end up being combinations of "compatible" genres, e.g. someone had "Indie Rock" but I had "Indie Rock & Lo-Fi". Let's keep adding them as separate items (just like you see it in your iTunes if it's slightly different from an item already on the list), then we can figure out if iTunes is doing some smart combining of genres if there are a lot of duplicates joined by "&". <comment26595> Doesn't seem like anyone is going to come up with an answer soon, so I'll go with the community-driven wiki choice! <comment46657> If and when anyone comes up with a better answer, you can always switch your acceptance to the new answer and this list can live on as long as people wish it to be updated. <comment46742> I'll keep that in mind. I like the community answer the best so far, though. <comment48565> Asked and answered. ;)
