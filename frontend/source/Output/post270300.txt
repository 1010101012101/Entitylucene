Requirements for App Store Review Video? <body> strongBackground:/strong  When submitting an (iOS) application for review which has functionality depending on a specific hardware, Apple asks for a Video, demonstrating the feature(s).     If we’re not able to access part of your app because it’s geo-locked or otherwise restricted, provide a link to a video of the functionality   (source)  strongThe Question:/strong  strongAre there any requirements or restrictions on this video?/strong  (Examples: Can it be edited or should it be continuous? Can it be uploaded to a video sharing site or otherwise where should it be hosted? etc.).  <answer270304> You can host it on a site like Vimeo or YouTube. Set the strongvideo unlisted/strong and send Apple the private URL.  You can do do strongsome editing/strong to clarify upfront what will be shown next. Please stronginclude all necessary steps/strong to use your app.  Shorten a process in post if it takes very long. Indicate emthat/em and emby how much/em it was shortened.  Good luck with your app!  <comment339664> Do you have maybe a source where you got these informations from? Or experience with posting an app for review with a video? <comment339669> @Allan This question can't *only* be answered by Apple, anyone can answer this, either through experience, through their previous app submissions, or through finding another source? <comment339673> @Allan I agree, everything you've said is true but nothing you've said would suggest that would make it off-topic? There are plenty of questions about what Apple wants and plenty of answers from experience or by quoting a relevant source. <comment339675> @grgarside- True...gave it some thought and retracted my vote. <comment339973> @grgarside yes, that's what I meant. Thanks <comment339974> @Steeve this is what I learnt when I worked with another developer in 2016.
