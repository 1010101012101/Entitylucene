Second monitor randomly turns off and on <body> I have an iMac running 10.9.2 and sporadically the second monitor turns off then on. It's only off for a second or two. It's an Acer AL2216W. It's connected from display port to DVI.  <comment152386> Is it possible that the monitor is broken? <comment152432> I also think it's a problem with the monitor, it happens with my LG every once in a while and I think it's related to variations in the electricity.
