Mavericks: Enable virtual keyboard on login screen <body> How can the virtual keyboard be enabled at the login screen?  On Windows it is really easy, but I haven't found to way of enabling it on a Mac.  <answer220646> I am sorry to say that this is not possible in Mac OS X unlike in Microsoft Windows. Maybe you could just wait for Apple to include it in their future releases. I hope I helped you :-)  <comment164137> As far as I know this has never been possible in any version of OS X. <comment205908> I need the same feature on Yoisemite. Really annoing as you can do pretty much everything with the magic mouse from meters away - but you can't log in.
