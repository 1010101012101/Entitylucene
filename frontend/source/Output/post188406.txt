Can not add calendar subscriptions to iCloud <body> I can't add subscriptions to my iCloud Calendar anymore. If I want for example add the holiday calendar via Mac Calendar Setting I get this error message     The server responded: “403” to operation CalDAVAddSubscriptionCalendarQueueableOperation.   I am pretty sure, this was possible! Did this change?  <comment222950> You mean the ics file doesn't download, or you get that error when it tries to open in Calendar? <comment222951> I get an error when I add the subscription. <comment222954> 403 is a pretty clear error - forbidden. The connection is being made but not allowed for some reason. Maybe check your iCloud login, from control panel & web, make sure all seems OK. <comment222959> My iCloud login is fine. Everything works, except this.
