Switch off keyboard backlight on new MacBooks <body> Older MacBooks had a dedicated key to switch off the keyboard backlight (like the mute key). It was kbdF8/kbd if I'm not mistaken.  Is it possible to replicate its functionality (e.g.: keyboard shortcut) on the new models?  <answer23390> You can turn it off as follows:  ul liApple menu  System Preferences.../li liKeyboard  Toggle "Automatically illuminate keyboard in low light"/li /ul  Note: If you disable the option, you can dim keyboard light with kbdF5/kbd and kbdF6/kbd.  <answer23404> The easiest way is probably to just hold down the dimmer key. Should turn it off less than a second. However it sounds like you want a single press button to turn it off.  It's a bit convoluted, but it should work: Using Automator, make an application out of the Applescript from this MacRumors thread. To do this, open Automator, choose emApplication/em from the options, search for the emRun AppleScript/em action and add it to the workflow, paste in the script and save. You should end up with something like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2hPGm.png" alt="Automator script"That should give you an application that will disable the backlight.  QuickSilver is free, and you can set a "trigger" to launch the app and bind it to any key you want. If you want to use a function key, try FunctionFlip. It lets you choose which function keys on your MacBook you want to work as actual F-keys and which you want controlling the hardware functions. You can rebind whatever F-key you like and still use the rest for hardware functions if you like.  It's worth noting that the Applescript seems to be a disable-only script. There are directions on the accompanying post to make an enable script. With a bit of modification you could probably make it a toggle script, maybe someone else could chime in with that?  Hope that helps.  <comment26103> That's not what I asked. <comment26104> Sorry, I was misled by your title. Guess the answer is helpful if you like to dim by function keys. I'm not aware of an ON/OFF functionality on new MacBooks.
