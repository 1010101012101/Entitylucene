How can I trigger any actions while Alfred is on the front on Keyboard Maestro? <body> I would like to cancel the Alfred search by code⌃+C/code on Keyboard Maestro. On Karabiner, you can set Alfred as codeonly/code and set your keyboard settings.  I created a new macro group and added Alfred into the macro group. And the group status is the following, where only codeAlfred/code is on the front should the macro be executed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9RU83.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, the problem seems that Alfred would never be considered an "active" app on Keyboard Maestro, as it only pulls the app window to the front while the application focus won't be changed, which should be reflected on the top-left app name (the next to the apple symbol).   I confirmed that the key trigger worked properly if I changed a settings from codeAvailable in these applications:/code to something others, which clearly means the keyboard trigger action, code⌃+C/code is defined correctly.  On Karabiner, even the Alfred doesn't gain the top-level focus, the shortcut works properly. Is it possible to do the same on Keyboard Maestro?
