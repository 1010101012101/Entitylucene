How to fast set hot corners in Mavericks? <body> I used a downloaded applescript to fast enable/disable hot corners but they don't work after I upgrade to Mavericks. Someone knows what's happening?  Here's the disable script, hope it'll help you know what I'm talking about.  precodetell application "System Events"     activate     if UI elements enabled then         tell expose preferences             set properties of the top left screen corner to {activity:none, modifiers:{}}             set properties of the top right screen corner to {activity:none, modifiers:{}}             set properties of the bottom left screen corner to {activity:none, modifiers:{}}             set properties of the bottom right screen corner to {activity:none, modifiers:{}}         end tell     else         tell application "System Preferences"             activate             set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"             display dialog "UI element scripting is not enabled. Check \"Enable access for assistive devices\""         end tell     end if end tell  tell application "System Preferences" to quit /code/pre  <answer108635> Before Mavericks there was indeed a property in System Events called "Expose preference".   Since 10.7 Lion, Expose was replaced by Mission Control, so this must be a remaining of this past time (The pref pane is called codeExpose.prefPane/code).   But in Mavericks this property was removed and not replaced.   codetell application "System Events" to get properties/code returns   ul lisecurity preferences/li linetwork preferences /li liscreen saver preferences/li liappearance preferences/li liCD and DVD preferences/li lidock preferences/li /ul  And none of them has access to the hot corner properties.   So, no it's currently not possible to do the same thing. Or to be more precise, to do it without UI scripting. (BTW your script does not use UI scripting features).   <answer112069> I was also searching for an answer to this question and finally got very angry with the Apple developers. As I discovered the scripting support for some of the preference panes is gone. However, I discovered this link  Just use the favourite key method  which I find quite a good solution. This does not solve your problem with scripting, I know, but I would argue that this is even the more elegant solution, because the best line of code is the one that was never written, or something.  I can live with this solution, I hope some others can as well.   I post the solution here as well, because I am always angry when I find some solution that works and the link is broken: (This solution is stolen from LexFriedman at http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130621130534978)  But anyone who uses Hot Corners (which OS X refers to interchangeably as Active Screen Corners) triggers those mouse-controlled shortcuts accidentally sometimes. The solution is this: When you're choosing a Hot Corner setting from one of the drop-down menus, hold down your preferred modifier key or keys. You'll see the options change from, say, Mission Control to Option Mission Control" instead.  From then on, your corner will only work when you're also holding down the modifier key(s) you specified. Now, trips to the Apple menu won't trigger your Hot Corner shortcut—unless you're pressing your selected modifier key, too.  <answer138675> A solution was posted at https://discussions.apple.com/message/23989931:  precodeproperty theSavedValues : {"Mission Control", "Desktop", "Dashboard", "Launchpad"} -- for example  tell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.expose"     tell application "System Events"         tell window "Mission Control" of process "System Preferences"             click button "Hot Corners…"             tell sheet 1                 tell group 1                     set theCurrentValues to value of pop up buttons                     if theCurrentValues is {"-", "-", "-", "-"} then                         repeat with i from 1 to 4                             set thisValue to item i of theSavedValues                             tell pop up button i                                 click                                 click menu item thisValue of menu 1                             end tell                         end repeat                     else                         copy theCurrentValues to theSavedValues                         repeat with i from 1 to 4                             tell pop up button i                                 click                                 click last menu item of menu 1                             end tell                         end repeat                     end if                 end tell                 click button "OK"             end tell         end tell     end tell     quit end tell /code/pre  <comment131662> This counts as a workaround, but not as convenient. <comment131716> I provided the answer here: But anyone who uses Hot Corners (which OS X refers to.... and set the link. I do not understand the remark. I thought this makes it a NOT-link-only answer. <comment131718> I disagree on can.'s comment: "This counts as a workaround, but not as convenient" as this depends on the use case. I am using the corners rather seldom. If you are using it all the time and want to switch it of during games or multi screen work, can. is right. <comment178328> WTF it changes again in Yosemite... <comment195856> Also see https://github.com/hekevintran/HotCornerSaver.  This one is written for Mavericks and should work on Yosemite.
