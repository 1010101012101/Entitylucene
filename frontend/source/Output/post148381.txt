How to delete photos from iPhoto album (not only removed from album)? <body> In iPhoto, select some photos in an album, delete them only remove the photos from the albums (but are not actually deleted).  How can I delete photos (move to Trash) inside iPhoto albums (like deleting photos in Library  Photos view)?  <answer148382> Easy.  When you open up your album, do a right mouse click on the image and the codeTrash/code icon appears. Just click that and the actual image is removed from the album but placed in the codeTrash/code as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RT02S.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer148383> Select photos in an album, press kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbddelete/kbd.  <answer176602> just right click click the trash icon and go to the column menu`s trash (the vertical menu left to your screen) and click on the top right empty trash. hope this helps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TB9iI.png" alt="Trash"  <answer178637> There's a trash can within iPhoto. To clear the space from your hard drive, you have to empty the trash can within the program. Click "iPhoto" next to the apple when the interface is selected. It's like the 4th option down. Then your hard drive will be restored.   <comment174800> No. At least, it does not work for me. The photo is removed from the Album but not in Trash. iPhoto 9.5.1 <comment200439> @ohho You are correct. This delete’s the photo from the album, but also *immediately* trashes the photo. So it never gets to the “Trash” area; it’s just deleted at the same moment it is removed from the album. <comment201323> Is your question about "How to remove a photo from the whole iPhoto library"? <comment201325> @JakeGould: could you clarify what is the exact function of this `Trash` button. On my iPhoto interface, this button looks like inactived (it is grey).
