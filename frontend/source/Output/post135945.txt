Determine what's using the 'system' cpu in OS X Mavericks <body> I am running a job in R that forks multiple processes. Every once in a while it seems that when the forked processes return and the next job starts, the previously forked processes terminate, but the CPU for those processes moves from 'User' to 'System'. So my activity monitor looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3El1j.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I debug this? How can I determine what processes are using the 'System' section in the screenshot? They do not show up if I sort by CPU in activity monitor, or on another tab (e.g., memory).  My activity monitor is showing 'all processes', so I do see running processes for the root user. However, all of the 'System' CPU is unaccounted for in activity monitor. And I tried showing 'system processes', but nothing with high cpu shows up there (which makes sense since these processes also show up for 'all processes').  The R use case may not be relevant. Or it may be. But generally, what I'd like to know is how to determine what is using the 'System' portion of the CPU load in OS X Mavericks.  EDIT: Here's an output of the top command. Same story. All % CPU under System is unnaccounted for in top, as well as in activity monitor. I have 12 physical cores (24 with hyper threading) on the machine, so 8 forked R processes each taking 100% cpu only accounts for 33% of CPU (what's under User).  precodeProcesses: 202 total, 10 running, 9 stuck, 183 sleeping, 845 threads                                                                                                                                                      16:40:46 Load Avg: 16.81, 14.89, 11.47  CPU usage: 32.97% user, 35.27% sys, 31.74% idle  SharedLibs: 10M resident, 3332K data, 0B linkedit.

To view system process or all process, select   precodeView --&gt; All Processes  /code/pre  or   precodeView --&gt; System Processes /code/pre  (in the standard app menu at the top of your screen, not within the Activity Monitor window)  <comment161173> The User/System CPU usage is fairly arbitrary, does it really matter what the formality of the processor usage is? CPU time is CPU time, and that's easy to check. <comment161176> Except that it's not easy to check in this case. The percent in system is not represented as any process in activity monitor. That's the problem. I don't know what process it is, so I don't know how to kill it. <comment161179> But what you care if the process uses a high % as "User" or "System"? The distinction between them is completely arbitrary and quite meaningless. It's ultimately just CPU utilization, either it's there or it's not. Just sort by CPU usage and you'll get the top CPU usage culprits. <comment161190> Doing that accounts for the stuff in the blue. The stuff in the red is unaccounted for. <comment161191> Yes it does, you just need to male sure you show processes from all users from the drop down menu in the top right of the window <comment161192> Already did that; it's mentioned in the post. <comment161193> Oops missed that. That list accounts for all processes on your machine. All cpu usage will he accounted for. In case youre doubtful, you can compare it to something else, such as the output of the `top` command. <comment161307> `top` command shows the same story. <comment161320> Those are all the processes on your machine.
