Macbook and iPhone not discoverable on bluetooth or airdrop <body> I am unable to use the AirDrop feature between my iPhone6s (iOS 9) and my 2014 MBP running OSX 10.11.1 (Mavericks). The jPhone won't show up in the MBP's AirDrop window (accessed from codeFinder&gt;Go&gt;AirDrop/code) and vice versa.   I was able to use my phone with another MBP with Mavericks flawlessly. I also tried to directly link them using Bluetooth (since AirDrop works via Bluetooth) and they were still unable to discover each other. I'm not sure whether this worked on Yosemite.  How can I fix this problem?  <answer212443> Not sure what was wrong with the Bluetooth discoverability, but I found a fix. It also fixes AirDrop since Bluetooth is its underlying technology.  You just need to delete a certain file, in my case I chose to rename it so I still had the original. You can do that using codeFinder/code or in the codeTerminal/code with the following command:  codesudo mv /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist.orig/code  Do this then restart Bluetooth and your devices should now be discoverable.
