merging exchange and iCloud contacts in iPad <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Exchange contacts do not appear in iCloud       I have sent my Gmail contacts to my iPad via Microsoft Exchange. I now want to back them up to my iCloud account but they reside as a different group in the iPad contacts.  How can I move or merge them to my iCloud group in contacts to sync with iCloud?  Many thanks, Harry  <answer34095> There was a similar question recently. This Apple support article includes the quote:     Data stored with iCloud will not interact with your Microsoft  Exchange data, while likewise your Exchange data will not interact with iCloud data.
