Why my application icons wiggle when I press ALT key in Launchpad? <body> I tried Launchpad first time today and went through the common modifier keys &amp; their combinations to see if some hidden options appear.  When I pressed kbd⌥ ALT/kbd all the apps started wiggling. What does it mean?  <answer19780> If you click and hold them they also start wiggling. It lets you drag them around, to re-arrange them, and also delete apps from the Mac App Store.  <answer19790> Wiggle is the edit mode. (so you can delete or uninstall the apps that came from the app store)   Holding alt is the quickest way to enter edit mode.  <answer19793> When they are wiggling you can rearrange them AND delete/remove apps that you yourself have downloaded. System apps (like iOS) cannot be deleted.  <comment21741> Holding also wiggles—true. But I can drag them and rearrange them even *when they're not wiggling;* hence I presume that wiggling doesn't mean just draggability. <comment21744> What is "edit mode" then? I can reorder the apps even while nothing wiggles. Is it something else? <comment21745> System apps and **[non-Appstore apps](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17863/how-do-you-delete-apps-from-lions-launchpad)**, it seems. Would the Appstore apps wiggle too if I had them or would they stand still? <comment21747> I'll clarify the answer - it makes it so you can delete apps from the app store - i was wrong to say reorder. iOS has trained me to think you can only reorder icons in edit mode - but that's not so on the Mac Launchpad. Confusingly (to me), you can even launch an app in edit mode.
