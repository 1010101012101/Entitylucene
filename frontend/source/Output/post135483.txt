How to assign multiple apps to single focus command shortcut in Slate? <body> I would like to use a single keyboard shortcut to focus on multiple applications in Slate. For example, I want to map Command+1 to Chrome and Firefox. Each time I press Cmd+1 the focused application should rotate. Is this possible? If so, how can I do this?  precodebind 1:cmd focus 'Chrome' bind 1:cmd focus 'Firefox' /code/pre  <answer135581> For example save this script as code~/bin/chromeorfirefox/code and make it executable:  precode#!/bin/bash if [[ $(lsappinfo visibleprocesslist|cut -d\" -f2) = Google\ Chrome ]]; then   open -a Firefox else   open -a Google\ Chrome fi /code/pre  Then add  precode1:cmd shell '~/bin/chromeorfirefox' /code/pre  to code~/.slate/code.  codelsappinfo/code was added in 10.9. You can use a script like this in 10.8 and earlier:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript if (path to frontmost application) is (path to application "Google Chrome") then     "Firefox" else     "Google Chrome" end if tell application result     reopen     activate end tell /code/pre
