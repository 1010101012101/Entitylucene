List contents and extract individual files from password protected archive file <body> I want to list contents of a compressed archive file, then choose some individual files to be extracted. Archive is password protected.  I tried Unarchiver and Keka but it seems none of them has a file manager feature like 7zip. Both apps extract the file immediately. When archive file size is big this behaviour causes a waste of time and disk space.  How can I do this on Mac OS X (Mavericks) ?  [*] There is a feature request here for Keka for this problem but it is unfortunately 3 years old.  <answer155487> http://archiverapp.com This one can do it for example.   <answer155489> Software recommendations are really off-topic for SE, as they go out of date rapidly, but, until such time as the question is put on hold...  Better Zip - $20 - can extract or add individual items, orbr Zipster - £10 - makes archives look &amp; act like folders, work in progress so not all formats yet but looks like it will be good  <comment182903> Adding a bit of detail would help, such as the price if it's not freeware - £14 in this case
