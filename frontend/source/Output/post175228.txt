Extension to hide Safari toolbar <body> I used to have an extension that hided the toolbar completely (which I installed from a website, outside the extensions market) giving a minimalist look, but it suddenly got removed from my Safari for some reason, and I can't find it back in Google.  Luckily I had a screenshot of the extension running:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TrQIK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone knows how was this extension called, and probably why it got removed without any notice?  <answer175336> You can just select View - Hide Toolbar in Safari... no extension required  <comment206556> You know you can just select *View* - *Hide Toolbar* in Safari... no extension required. <comment206674> @sdmeyers Works nice! I remember installing an extension for this in the past though, weird. Do you mind answering the question?
