Is there a way to disable WiFi auto-connect on iPhone? <body> Is there a way to disable automatically connecting to a known WiFi network on an iPhone?  Say that your work/school has a monitored WiFi network. You only want to connect to it when you plan on downloading a large file, so you don't want to connect to it automatically. But you also don't want to re-enter your credentials every time you want to connect.  Is there a way to tell your iPhone to forget an network until you want to re-connect?  <answer255288> At this time, there is no way to do this.  Your only options are to have it always on or always off.    I suggest letting Apple know you want this feature by providing them feedback here.  <answer255302> Currently, you would have to tell the iphone to forget the network and then enter your credentials again later. There is not a way to have it remember the credentials if you don't want it to automatically join.   <comment317950> Which is exactly what I said about an hour before your answer....
