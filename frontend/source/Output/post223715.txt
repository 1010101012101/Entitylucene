Back to My Mac: BTMM kMMServiceFailureNotification <body> About a week ago iCloud's Back to My Mac service silently stopped working and will no longer start.  I discovered an error icon in System Preference's iCloud panel reporting the error: strongBack to My Mac isn't working because it couldn't start properly./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jD9vv.png" alt="Back to My Mac isn&#39;t working because it couldn&#39;t start properly."  Following the trouble shooting steps provided by Apple has not fixed the problem. This includes restarting, and signing out &amp; back into iCloud. An Apple support discussion thread, I cannot start Back To My Mac Since Wed Last Week, suggests this is not an isolated problem.  The codesystem.log/code messages at the time of attempted enabling suggests an error occurred:  precodeJan 16 09:59:46 Mac-Pro com.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice[731]: AOSKit ERROR: LH request failed, url=https://p33-btmm.icloud.com:443/v1/hello, requestHeaders=     {         "Accept-Language" = "en-us";         Authorization = "...";         "X-Mme-Client-Info" = "&lt;[redacted]&gt; &lt;Mac OS X;10.11.2;15C50&gt; &lt;com.apple.AOSKit/232 (com.apple.systempreferences/14.0)&gt;";         "X-Mme-Country" = GB;         "X-Mme-Device-Id" = "[redacted]";         "X-Mme-Timezone" = CET;     },     error=Error Domain=AOSErrorDomain Code=1000 "(null)" UserInfo={HttpStatusCode=503, DialogInfo={         DialogType = Unknown;     }}, httpStatusCode=503 Jan 16 09:59:46 Mac-Pro com.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice[731]: [AOSAccounts] : BTMM operation not successful  Jan 16 09:59:46 Mac-Pro com.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice[731]: [AOSAccounts] : BTMM kMMServiceFailureNotification dictionary &lt;CFBasicHash 0x7f921e2ba590 [0x7fff7c6cd440]&gt;{type = mutable dict, count = 2,     entries =&gt;         0 : &lt;CFString 0x7fff7b7cc170 [0x7fff7c6cd440]&gt;{contents = "ServiceFailureErrorKey"} = Error Domain=AOSErrorDomain Code=1000 "(null)" UserInfo={HttpStatusCode=503, DialogInfo={         DialogType = Unknown;     }}         2 : &lt;CFString 0x7fff7b7cc110 [0x7fff7c6cd440]&gt;{contents = "ServiceFailureTypeKey"} = &lt;CFString 0x7fff7b7cc130 [0x7fff7c6cd440]&gt;{contents = "ServiceFailureTypeEnable"}     } /code/pre  I have reported the bug to Apple as rdar://24219994  Is there any solution?  <answer223834> In response to your question "Is there any solution?": strongemYes/em/strong  strongemInitial Feedback:/em/strong I appear to have the same problem, which appeared out of the blue and which I noticed only on around 13 Jan (4 days prior). It appeared to have occurred at the same time as the last in a 3-4 week series of occasional spurious iCloud ID errors, requiring me to enter my iCloud password on each occasion. Back to my Mac is not accessible on any of the 3 macs using my personal account.  I spent 90 minutes on the phone with Apple Support. The problem could not be resolved immediately and was escalated to the level of the engineering staff for offline investigation.  strongemUpdate:/em/strong 3 days later BTMM was working correctly on all my machines, having been fixed at the Apple end. No explanation as yet as to the cause or how resolved. I recommend you contact Apple Support directly  <comment271350> Thank you for your insight and for contacting Apple. Your answer is helpful. <comment272275> Back to My Mac resumed working with no change on my part. Apple notified me through rdar://24219994 that a restart may be required but gave no detail about changes on their side.
