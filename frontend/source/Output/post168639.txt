Always show markup toolbar in Preview <body> As the title says: is there a way to permanently show the markup toolbar in Preview?  (working on OSX 10.10.1 Yosemite)  <answer218444> No, the toolbar seems to reset every time a new image is opened.  However you can use the shortcut kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdA/kbd to toggle the option to show/hide it.  <answer231653> In addition to the already mentioned Shortcut kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdA/kbd Preview in El Capitan (and Yosemite I guess) features a toolbar icon that allows to open the markup toolbar with a single click instead of clicking through the emView/em menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5rGbw.png" alt="Markup Toolbar Icon"  To make the Toolbar visible, go to codeView/code  codeShow Toolbar/code in the menu. (Thanks to Rachel for this aditional hint!)  <answer238913> I use keyboard maestro to effectively "pin" the menu to show.  I just setup a rule so when the window title changes in preview it selects "show markup toolbar" if the menu option is available.  Technically it is clicking the menu, but it happens so fast it just looks like it's always on.  Al  <comment246839> Still no answers! Pretty sure it remembered your last setting before the upgrade to Yosemite ... annoying if you regularly use the markup toolbar <comment345903> To elaborate on Wedi's comment, you need to go to View Show Toolbar. Then you will have access to the toolbox icon on the top to easily access the markup toolbar each and every time you exit and open a preview window.
