How to use unix find and exclude paths? <body> I need to exclude Time Machine path /Volumes/somedrive/Backups.backupdb from the results of codefind/code.  I currently use the following code, but it generates massive logs as it finds and includes all files in the Time Machine folder:  precodedo shell script "find -x " &amp; from_path &amp; " -print0 | xargs -0 ls -d -F -P -l -T -a -e -i -o -p -q " &amp; from_path &amp; " &gt; " &amp; to_path user name "name" password "pass" with administrator privileges /code/pre  I tried some examples from this site but I can't figure it out.  How I can use find and exclude certain paths?  <answer236489> There's a great answer over on Stack Overflow covering this: Exclude directory from find . command  Essentially, the command to exclude directories from codefind/code is as follows:  precodefind . -type d \( -path dir1 -o -path dir2 -o -path dir3 \) -prune -o -print /code/pre  From the above example, you should be able to extrapolate excluding a single directory.  h3A brief explanation:/h3  precode-type d        # type: directories -path dir1     # your path -o             # "or" -prune         # skip the previous set -print         # print results /code/pre  <comment289553> The `-x` will exclude your Time Machine volume. Remove the `& from_path` after `xargs` in your `do shell script` statement.
