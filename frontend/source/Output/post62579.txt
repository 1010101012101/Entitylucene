Where are notes stored in Mountain Lion <body> I ha a hard drive that died recently in my macbook, I've replaced the hard drive etc so no issues there. Unfortunately, it appears I wasn't backing up the notes app to iCloud, and I really need to get some back...  I've managed to get the hard drive spinning in a usb dock that I have so I can access it, but I don't know where notes was storing it's data. Any ideas?  <answer62591> They're in code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/CoreData/ExternalRecords//code.  You can probably just copy the whole code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes//code folder from the old installation.  <comment123330> I have a very similar problem due to a simple migration to `Mountain Lion`. Everything related to my previous notes is still in place here: `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/`. My question is: "From this directory tree, how could I recover the possibility to read all my previous notes?"
