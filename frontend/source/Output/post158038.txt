Starting macbook air automatically <body> How could I possibly eliminate the user accounts at login to start my mac automatically?  Actually I have a couple of user accounts both admin / guest however I do not want to login by entering passwords..  How could I set it up such that it starts automatically without requiring any verification?  <answer158042> You need to disable codeFileVault/code and then it would allow automatic login. But be aware thats not good for your information protection.. your mac would be vulnerable..  <answer158043> Sure you can. On codeSystem Preferences â†’ Users &amp; Groups/code under codeLogin Options/code you have codeAutomatic login/code where you can chose an user.   When you select an user there, It will automatically login when you switch your Mac.
