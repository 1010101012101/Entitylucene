Get notified about new iOS releases <body> Is there a way to get notified about upcoming iOS final releases, maybe a week or a few days before the actual release happens? For major releases, there seems to be a GM seed before the actual release happens, but for minor releases (like the upcoming iOS 9.3), there are just a bunch of beta builds. I'd like to skip testing my app with all of the beta builds and just focus on the most recent one, a few days before the release actually happens.  <answer223469> Historically, Apple has not pre-announced specific release dates for updates or major releases. This is likely done to allow Apple to better deal with last minute problems.  Your best option is to follow Apple Developer News. An RSS feed is available for this information.  <comment270937> Thought so. Thanks for your answer, subscribed to the feed :) <comment270938> Sadly tracking Apple's releases is a cost of being a developer. Avoiding the latest frameworks and *strictly* following expected API use will save most minor updates causing problems. <comment271200> Other than [real-time releases](https://twitter.com/iosreleases), no.
