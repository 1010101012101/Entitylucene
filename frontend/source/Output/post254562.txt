Console outputs cryptic messages <body> I used to use Console, with a Filter of codebackupd/code to check what Time Machine was doing; e.g. whether it had run on both of my backup disks, how much was backed up etc.  I have just installed Sierra and it is running initial backup (which has been going for hours) and tried to check. The output seems to be a series of messages similar to the following:-  precodedefault 16:06:38.599574 +1000   backupd Claim 5426B26B-201B-444A-B232-AD060267D59D invoked in client default 16:06:39.013627 +1000   backupd Received claim &lt;private&gt; default 16:06:39.015079 +1000   backupd Claim 776FBB88-B67B-48D6-9180-F2511B414003 granted in server default 16:06:39.015167 +1000   backupd Claim 776FBB88-B67B-48D6-9180-F2511B414003 invoked in client /code/pre  Does anyone have any idea what this means, and more importantly how to get a meaningful output.
