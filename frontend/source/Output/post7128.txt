Using timed access control in airport extreme base station <body> I have an airport base station model A1354. I am attempting to setup MAC Timed Access so a laptop can only connect between 5:00AM and 11:00pm through the Airport Utility version 5.5.2 (552.11). My AEBS is running firmware version 7.5.2  When I try to enter the time values by double clicking over the time and entering 05:00 AM and 11:00PM the time values don't stay as soon as it looses focus. Instead they become what is in the following screenshot, and the laptop looses connectivity as soon as I update the base station. I also tried entering the values in military time with the same result.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9CC2.png" alt="Timed Access Control Setup Window"  Here is the requested screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aYwJA.png" alt="Access Control panel"  <answer7794> Are you typing your times in the following format: HH:MM  ? as in, with a space between the time and AM/PM? I know this sounds like a stupid question, but my AEBS has done some stupid things when I tried to type it without the space (e.g. 12:43PM).  <answer7802> When you've altered the times, click the '+' button so a second line appears, then click 'Done'.    <comment8132> Can you post a screenshot of the Airport panel before you clicked on Access Control? <comment8255> I'm confused, how did you add the screenshot for Bill? I mean is this his screenshot or yours? <comment8257> It was actually the 'Access Control' tab I was interested in seeing and in particular, Bills settings.  Thanks anyway tho <comment8448> That did the trick.  Thank you! <comment8449> I was able to edit the question and add the screenshot. <comment8455> Beautiful!  Haha, it's funny but that's not very intuitive.  Glad that sorted it.
