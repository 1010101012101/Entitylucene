Preview in OSX El Capitan defaults to 100% scale <body> When printing a jpeg, preview now defaults to 100% scale, which is not what I want. I am having to manually select scale to fit and fill entire paper. How can I make it always default to the latter (as it used to in previous versions of OSX)?  <answer235555> In the Preview Preferences, you can define the 100% scale.  In Preview press kbdCmd/kbd kbd,/kbd, then click on the emImages/em tab.  You will get two options  ul li1 image pixel equals 1 screen pixel/li liSize on screen equals size on printout/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAgMq.png" alt="enter image description here"  Select the second one.
