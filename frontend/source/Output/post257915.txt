Any fix to hyper-scrolling on macOS Sierra? <body> I noticed the hyper scrolling problem using the Terminal, and JetBrains IDEs using the Magic Mouse, (some people report the same problem with the trackpad).  Is there any way to disable this behavior and get back to the way it was in El Capitan?  <comment322281> Can you please tell us what "hyper-scrolling" is? <comment322460> oh, just faster than normal scrolling <comment322461> what is normal? the way it has been all the time before Sierra
