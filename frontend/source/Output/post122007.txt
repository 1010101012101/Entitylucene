How to tell if the MBA (Mavericks) is connected to the 2.4 or 5 ghz network? <body> I've been having issues connecting to wifi access points, and I am wondering if the band is messing things up.  How do I tell what band a wifi connection is using on the laptop if I don't have access to the router settings?  <answer122009> I use iStumbler, which specifies the frequency.  <answer122011> About This Mac  More Info  System Report  Network  WiFi     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmvON.jpg" alt="PICTURE"   <answer122012> h1Option + Wifi Menu/h1  Hold the Option key down and select your WiFi icon in the menu bar ( &#x2325; + img src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/il/yosemite-disconnected_icon-public.png" width="20"/ ).

Choose codeWindow/code  codeInfo/code to get more detailed WiFi networking or scan for better channels, check for interference, etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOcEl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment154396> Nice, well hidden, but Cmd-2 opens it.
