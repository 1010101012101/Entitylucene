macOS Sierra and QNAP SMB share - Disk does not support Time Machine backups. (error 45) <body> Quote from macOS Sierra: Disks you can use with Time Machine     If your backup disk is on a network, the network server can use Server   Message Block (SMB) file sharing. Your Mac must be connected to the   SMB server when you set up Time Machine. After you select the network   disk in Time Machine preferences, Time Machine automatically connects   to the disk when itâ€™s time to back up or restore your data.   precode&gt; sudo tmutil setdestination "/Volumes/$NAME/"                                                                                                                                                                                                       Password: /Volumes/$NAME: Disk does not support Time Machine backups. (error 45) The backup destination could not be set. /code/pre  I use QNAP TS-251 with latest firmware. The SMB share is working fine with Finder.  Any idea? I don't wish to use AFP.  I followed the instructions How do I set up Time Machine backups between my Mac and NAS on a domain via the SMB protocol?. When mounted as SMB it doesn't work, but with AFP it works.  <answer277004> QNAP says it is not supported!  <comment348686> whats your source? please paste original quote from vendor support
