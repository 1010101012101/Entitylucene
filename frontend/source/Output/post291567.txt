Cannot turn bluetooth on after wake <body> When my MacBook Pro is idle for a couple of minutes it automatically goes into sleep mode which turns off the Bluetooth. However, when it wakes again and I login; Bluetooth in the menu bar still indicates that it is on (both the icon and when click it the icon) and I am not able to reconnect to any deceives. I have to go to Bluetooth preferences to see that Bluetooth is actually off, and only if I toggle the 'Show Bluetooth in menu bar' will the menu bar show that Bluetooth is disabled.   The biggest problem is that I cannot turn Bluetooth on again (not in the menu bar nor in the preferences). I have to restart, to get it to work again.   I've tried resetting the Bluetooth module without luck.
