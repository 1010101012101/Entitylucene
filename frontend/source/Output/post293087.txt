Detect application focus event using applescript <body> It it possible to detect application focus event using applescript? What I'm trying to achieve is to open ios simulator when I focus on text editor. I know how to activate simulator but can't figure out how to detect when the editor is active.  <comment369755> What version of OS X/macOS and Xcode? <comment369759> @user3439894 macOS 10.12, xcode 8.3.3 <comment369800> Simulator is not AppleScript scriptable, meaning it does not have an AppleScript Dictionary. That leaves you with AppleScript UI Scripting and some manipulation using System Events in AppleScript, both of which are rather limited compared to an app that actually supports AppleScript via an application specific AppleScript Dictionary.
