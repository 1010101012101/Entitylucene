How can I achieve page-up and page-down in OS X? <body> I am using MacOSX Snow Leopard.  How do I achieve page-up and page-down?  <answer26931> It's kbd⌥/kbd + Up/Down arrow keys.  <answer26932> If you have a full keyboard you can use the pgup and pgdown keys on your keyboard, near the numpad.   If you are not using a full keyboard, function, labeled kbdfn/kbd on your keyboard, plus the up and down arrow keys will give you a page up and down.  For certain applications, particularly in shell / terminal / tty windows, the expected behaviour is achieved with kbdfn/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdarrow up/down/kbd  <answer85656> On my (Danish) keyboard layout (under 10.7.5) it is kbdfn/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbd↑/kbd/kbd↓/kbd.  <answer113926> PageUp: Fn+UP  PageDown: Fn+DOWN  Successfully tested on my brand new MBPro retina !  <answer118864> If you use KeyRemap4Macbook app, check under "Change Arrrow Up/Down/Left/Right" keys.  When you have this set up, Page Up and Page Down will work with irrsi – I log-on remotely to another linux host for that – you only need to press kbdShift/kbd + kbdPage Up/kbd or kbdPage Down/kbd will work for that window (as opposed to scrolling pages of OS X terminal window).  <answer118874> user Fn  PageUp: Fn+UP PageDown: Fn+DOWN  <answer123160> It's true that the hardware keyboard on Macintosh machines has:  kbdFn/kbd + kbd←/kbd = kbdHome/kbdbr kbdFn/kbd + kbd→/kbd = kbdEnd/kbdbr kbdFn/kbd + kbd↑/kbd = kbdPg up/kbdbr kbdFn/kbd + kbd↓/kbd = kbdPg down/kbd  So these "keys" fully exist already. This is apparent if you run Linux/Windows natively on your Mac.  However, macOS applications are responsible for handling these functions as they see fit, which is not something most of us expect. And the macOS Terminal application needs some tweaking to use them as we all expect.  I believe the reason for this is that macOS follows an old-school Unix tradition where:  kbdctrl/kbd + kbda/kbd = kbdHome/kbdbr kbdctrl/kbd + kbde/kbd = kbdEnd/kbd    I now use this routinely, but my terminal-reflexes still demand a proper home,end,pg-up,pg-down...   strongEdit macOS's Terminal Keyboard Binding Settings to match/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tI6af.png" alt="home" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/frykv.png" alt="end" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5iSyS.png" alt="page up" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mH32y.png" alt="page down"  I tend to get this entered by copying a similar entry that already exists and then using that delete a character button to remove the different bits before typing in the rest.  Overall, this will look along these lines: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dL5Bj.png" alt="Match the home, end, pg up and pg down"  This meets all my expectations for how this should work. It works in vim and through ssh.   <answer240360> Alt + up/down arrows: pgup/pgdown  Spacebar and shift + spacebar: : pgup/pgdown  Command + up/down arrows: home/end  <comment30867> This doesnt work for me? What am I doing wrong? <comment30944> @hobs not sure, but I'm actually on Lion, works either way for me, with fn and ⌥ <comment31001> Same here, Macbook 13 inch running 10.7, I will look into it. <comment31588> On OS X 10.6.8 I get about a 3-line scroll w/ opt+arrow versus actual PgUp PgDn behavior with the fn+arrow. <comment99148> -1 actually FN+Up/Down is not the same as FN+PageUp/PageDown. For example, the traditional PageUp/PageDown does not work in irssi. <comment106942> I have an US English keyboard and this is what works for me under terminal if I'm SSHed. <comment138626> Is this different than the answer from December that also says to use Fn key? http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/113926/5472 <comment138731> @hhh: It seems that irssi and some other terminal apps use `Shift`+`PgUp`/`PgDn`, so the key combination on a MBP would be `Shift`+`Fn`+`PgUp`/`PgDn`. <comment144977> It works for me in the terminal regardless of whether I'm SSHed. <comment164169> This is for the hardware mapping of these functions. OSX applications don't generally use these keys in the way most of us expect. ctrl+a and ctrl+e (home & end) are an option. My post below explains how to get the functionality you expect for the Terminal application. Each app handles these keys according to it's own settings. Strange. <comment190885> This has not been my experience. I have the full size Apple Keyboard hooked up to my Mac Pro and these keys only work as expected outside of OSX. My post below shows how to alter Terminal so it'll work normally. But it was also helpful when I learned that in general OSX has CTRL+A as HOME and CTRL+E as END <comment222260> I think it's really funny which answer has been accepted for this question. I guess different strokes for different folks? <comment233629> this should be the accepted answer, easier to read, and much more informative, thanks! <comment247398> This works for shells in VirtualBox with U.S. Extended keyboard layout (under 10.10.5)
