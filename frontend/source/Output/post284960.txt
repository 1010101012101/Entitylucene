Installing Putty on OSX? <body> I'm working on some Raspberry Pi's and I need serial communications to the units to determine IP address.    I've installed Putty via HomeBrew and with some assistance from this link.   I also installed MacPorts via this link.  When I run code$ putty/code, I get the error message:  code(putty:36407): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:/code  Anybody know what's going on?  Is there a better way to communicate with a remote device via USB - FTDI Serial Adapter and putty?    Note: I'm using MacOS Sierra (10.12.5)  <answer284968> So I gave up on codePutty/code and codeMacPorts/code.. I've now removed both programs.    For normal codessh/code communications, I just use codeterminal/code command line interface program.    For USB to FTDI serial communications I'm using a program called Cornflake.  It seems to work just fine.  (settings = device with USB in the title, baud: 115200, packet: none-8-1 and flow: none)  Hint: You want to have the USB/FTDI device plugged in with codeCornflake/code running BEFORE you power up the Raspberry Pi.    Update:  So Cornflake worked fine, kinda, sorta.   It didn't hide my login password which is not normally a problem, but I'm teaching others realtime with screen broadcast.  Any command line tool that does fancy stuff (e.g. nano) fails in Cornflake.  Instead I've now migrated to using the native command line terminal and the codescreen/code command, per this reference.  Open Terminal.  precode$   ls /dev/tty.*          # to see all available ports. /code/pre  You can now use the screen command to to establish a simple serial connection.  precode$    screen &lt;port_name&gt; &lt;baud_rate&gt;          # to create a connection. /code/pre  In my particular case:  precode$    screen /dev/tty.usbserial-AE00BS5L 115200 /code/pre  This works quite well.
