Remove completed reminders in OS X and iOS <body> I run the latest versions of OS X and iOS. Is there a way to mass-delete all completed reminders in both iOS and OS X? I’ve looked but can't seem to find a way so far.   <answer170700> You can set it up in your Automator.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oydQz.jpg" alt="delete"  You can be selective what is to be deleted by using find or filter action first.  Try it out.  <answer211075> In OSX, go to Completed in Reminders, Click on the first one in the list, shift click on the last one, go to Edit menu and then Delete.  <answer282192> As of iOS 10.3.2, there is no way to do mass-delete reminders on iOS.  It is possible on macOS:  ul liUsing the strongReminders/strong app in macOS Sierra, open the emScheduled/em list. Scroll up to reveal the strongShow/strong button in the upper-right. Click that, then click the first completed reminder. Next, kbd⇧ shift/kbd-click the last one. Go through your lists to delete completed reminders that had no due date./li liUsing any desktop or laptop browser, you can visit the iCloud web app and do the same. The only difference is the emScheduled/em list on the website does not allow you to mass-delete completed reminders./li liYou can mass-delete reminders via AppleScript, using strongScript Editor/strong./li /ul  The following script will delete all your completed reminders at once:  precodetell application "Reminders" to delete (reminders whose completed is true) /code/pre  You could tweak this to delete only reminders that you completed some time ago:  precodeset sixMonthsAgo to (current date) - 26 * weeks tell application "Reminders" to delete (reminders whose completion date is less than sixMonthsAgo) /code/pre  Save that script as an application and drop it in your code~/Applications/code folder. Then you can delete your completed reminders with a simple click from strongLaunchPad/strong, or even from the Dock.  If you wanted to get fancy you could then schedule a codeLaunchAgent/code to execute this script every night, then forget about it. strongemWith the usual caveat about running a program that deletes stuff automatically./em/strong  <answer285233> As far as I know you cannot do it in iOS 10.3 or in OS X 10.12, BUT... strongyou can do it on icloud.com/strong. Simply click on "completed reminders" to expand the list of completed reminders (translated from French icloud). You can then click "delete all completed reminders".   <comment201870> Thank you for that. Is there any way to remove completed reminders from iOS too? <comment201875> Did the answer solve your first question? if yes mark it as done, then post a new question about completed reminders.
