Map keyboard key to unix command <body> Simple I am looking for a way to map a keyboard key to a unix command. It could be as simple as literal as opening up terminal and pasting a required bit of text.   <answer26998> You could use a tool like Keyboard Maestro but it might be a bit overkill.   If you just want to execute a command in Terminal and close the window again:  ul liPut command in a shell script/li liMake it executable (codechmod +x .../code)/li liMove shell script to a convenient place (e.g. our Desktop)/li lirun shell script/command by double click/li /ul  <comment31028> I just want to run a command (eg pwd) in terminal via a keyboard key. When you press the key it could open terminal and paste in PWD and then close terminal, but this would be sloppy. <comment31076> Maybe a shell script is ok then, I've extended the answer accordingly. <comment44951> What sort of key? I assume you want a modified key, and don't want, say, the kbdL/kbd key to not type a `l` but rather run `sudo rm -Rf /`
