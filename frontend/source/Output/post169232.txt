Cannot clean-install OS Yosemite 10.10 "File system verify or repair failed" <body> MacBook Pro 13 Mid 2012 (Core i5 2500 Mhz/13.3"/1280x800/4096Mb) with SSD Samsung MZ-7KE512BW  I had to replace my hard drive, now I have an SSD. I've been trying to install (any possible) operating system. Purchased an USB thumb drive with Yosemite, as Mountain Lion internet recovery was not installing.  First attempt to install from the USB drive ran fine, I was stuck on "1 second remaining" for a while, after this it got through and my machine restarted. Then, I got an error     OS x could not be installed on your computer. file system verify or repair failed. quit the installer to restart your computer and try again.   So I did this, checked my hard drive was ok, no errors came up when I verified it. I went back to install. Similar progress bar and screen as the first install (ie., 12 minutes remaining), only now it's failing less than a minute in. Again get this File System Verify or Repair Failed error. See log below (starting with Macintosh HD: Missing coreservices).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EpW3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
