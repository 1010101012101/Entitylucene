Which cities have "flyover" in iOS 6 Maps? <body> Is there a list of which cities have 3D flyover data that is actually 3D and not an attempt to map a satellite image on false perspective? If not, could we crowd source this in a wiki-type answer?  <answer64736> h1Australia/h1  h2Australia/h2  ul liSydney/li /ul  h1Europe/h1  h2Denmark/h2  ul liCopenhagen/li /ul  h2France/h2  ul

You can edit Canuck Skier's answer and eventually it will hold everything or start a new answer.

Or is apple maps actually that bad that the cities not list in this answer don't appear at all? <comment78967> and it's woefully out of date already.
