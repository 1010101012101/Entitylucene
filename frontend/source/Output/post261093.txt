Where does Ulysses store its local content? <body> I'd like to backup my local content with my own scripts. But I'm not familiar about how OSX apps works. So I can't find where does Ulysses stores its local content.  Or generally, where usually does an OSX apps, stores its buffer content?  <answer261494> h1Content stored On My Mac/h1  If you do emnot/em sync your local content using iCloud (i.e. it's in the strongOn My Mac/strong section in your Ulysses sidebar), you can access each group in your Ulysses library at the following file path:  code~/Library/Containers/com.soulmen.ulysses3/Data/Documents/Library/Groups-ulgroup/ /code  Each group belongs it its own code-ulgroup/code directory and will have an (unhelpful) hash for a nameâ€”for example, codecba24c5b16a949c388b0204c9aa28867-ulgroup/code.  Within each code-ulgroup/code directory, your documents will each have their own code.ulysses/code file. And you guessed it, they also have a hash for a filename. Note that code.ulysses/code files actually contain both a codeContent.xml/code and a codeText.txt/code with your content in them.    h1Content synced via iCloud/h1  You will have a hard time accessing your Ulysses iCloud-stored library from Finder, but I seem to be able to access mine fine using the Terminal if you're comfortable doing that. It's stored similarly as I described above, but here is the file path you'll be looking for instead:  code~/Library/Mobile Documents/X5AZV975AG~com~soulmen~ulysses3/Documents/Library/Groups-ulgroup/code
