Change iPhone earbud button behavior <body> I recently bought an iPhone 3gs. It comes with a pair of apple earbuds that have a remote and a microphone.   I used to have an iPod, that has a set of earbuds that have a remote but not a microphone. When I long pressed the center button of the remote on the earbuds, the iPod said the title and artist of the current playing song.   On the iPhone though, when I long-press the center button (of the remote with microphone), it starts voice control.   Is there a way to change the iPhone settings to resemble the iPod settings? I don't ever use voice control, yet I do use the microphone for calling people while on my bike.  <answer35630> When the beep sounds you can ask:  "What song is this?"  It will speak the title, and artist. There isn't a way to turn this off sadly.  <comment40596> what no way? What should I ask exactly? <comment40597> What song is this <comment40619> I always used to use 'Who sings this?'. There are a handful of aliases all revolving around a few keywords I'm sure. <comment40620> It is possible to turn off Voice Control, but I have never done so, so I would have no idea what happens with a long button press after you do so.
