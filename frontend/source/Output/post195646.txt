Understanding what patching mean when installing programs <body> I've downloaded a program which gives me the instructions in this order:     sub[MacOSX]br   1.Install/Update the software.br   2.Copy patched AU/VST/RTAS.br   3.Run our keygen on Windows.br   4.Run the software and start activation.br   5.Select offline activation.br   6.Copy ComputerID to the keygen.br   7.Generate a Serial Number and an Authorization File.br   8.Register and Enjoy!  /sub   I opened Wine on my macbook in order to get the keygen to work.  However, when I save the authorization file it does not appear on my desktop.  Although, my main problem here is understanding what patching actually means.br What is it asking me to do?br I don't understand what I must do in order to activate this program.  <answer195703> A Patch is a small executable file which is used to change usually small sections of an existing application's code - for instance to fix small bugs noticed after the app's release… or, unfortunately in this case, to bypass the app's built-in security.  In this instance, with the patch being unofficial &amp; not distributed by the original developers, you have no way of knowing what additional payload might be in the patch - including key loggers, phone home code, botnet distribution networks… etc, etc.  Patches are not as common as they used to be.br Their benefit of being small &amp; lightweight was most useful back when we were all on slow dial-up connections &amp; software was released on CD/DVD - making it a large task to update user's software by sending out new CDs or making them download entire new versions.br A patch of only a few MB was then the best way to update.  Now we all have faster connections, the trend is now to issue a brand new updated version, which overwrites the old version entirely.  <comment233593> You definitely should not be requesting help regarding software cracks/keygens. <comment233612> I'm not convinced that Gason realized s/he was attempting to install a pirated app. This might have been a good opportunity to explain what patching is and why it's a threat to the security of one's computer, data and general privacy. <comment233619> @Zero I second Gason's suggestion. This seems like a perfect opportunity for that kind of explanation. I'd write such an answer myself right now if I weren't knackered. <comment233623> Could I ask @zero to perhaps edit the question for formatting and grammar <comment233696> I've tweaked this for format - someone else may have to make the decision on content. My answer only answers 'what is a patch?' & nothing more.
