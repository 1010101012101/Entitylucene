Blurry output to projector <body> I've connected a high-resolution projector to my MacBook Pro Retina through an Apple Mini DisplayPort-VGA adapter. It gets quite blurry (even for fonts) on the projector.  Here are the settings.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3vHat.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I make slides on the projector as clear as on the laptop?  <comment355295> Have you confirmed that the projector is in focus? <comment355304> @Allan, thx for ur response. I didn't check it as I supposed it is the problem of my laptop. Now, I connect my macbook to a 28in display. The problem still exists. <comment355319> VGA resolution is nowhere near Retina.  Can you connect via HDMI or other higher resolution adapter? <comment355345> @bjbk, the projector of my lab only offers VGA connection:-(
