Can not unlock my MacBook Pro once I locked it with Find my iPhone <body> I thought that i lost my MacBook Pro so I used Find my iPhone to lock it. Now that I found it an interrogation point is appearing on my screen  but there is nowhere I can write my pin. Can you please help me   <answer251434> You can always power off the Mac and you will be prompted for the pin when the machine reboots.   <comment312551> Please attach an image of your screen! <comment312592> Thank you but I found the solution . I needed to force shut down the mac then I pressed and holded the command + R buttons and then press and hold the power button after a padlock appeared and I wrote my pin and then I had to write another time my pin and my computer worked.
