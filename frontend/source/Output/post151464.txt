Upgrading Windows 8 to 8.1 Pro via Windows Store <body> Currently I'm running Windows 8 in Boot Camp (MacBook Pro Retina Mid-2012) and get a free update to Windows 8.1 Pro from Windows Store. My question is...  ul liShould I change the startup disk to Windows in Boot Camp Control Panel before upgrading to 8.1?/li liCan I just download and install it from the store and then just reinstall the Boot Camp Drivers to the newest (5.1.5621)./li /ul  Thank you. :)  <answer151465> I would set Windows to be the default boot until the update is finished, to prevent it being interrupted by unexpectedly booting to Mac.br I don't think it would hurt anything if it did, as the Windows install would simply wait until next time emit/em was booted.  I would definitely update Bootcamp before Windows, in case there is something about the existing drivers that may prevent you booting/finishing/accessing the Windows install if you did it the other way round.  I would, of course, also have a backup of everything before I started.
