Is there a way to hide/remove the drop box folder (not dropbox.com) that is inside of public folder? <body> Inside Public folder there is a folder called "Drop Box" (I'm not talking about dropbox.com) which is used for network/sharing purpose. Since I only use the machine locally, I would like to delete that folder, but doesn't matter how many time you delete or hide it, it keeps appear again.  Any tip?  <answer93498> You can hide it from from Finder by setting the hidden flag with Terminal  precodechflags hidden /path/to/folder/ /code/pre  and if you want to remove the flag  precodechflags nohidden /path/to/folder/ /code/pre  <comment109698> Welcome to Ask Different! <comment109702> That's the right answer. Just as some added info, if want to see hidden folders/files in Finder, go to Terminal and enter `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE` and `killall Finder`. To hide them again: `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE` and `killall Finder` again. <comment229294> Terminal states that the folder doesn't exist. Seems to have trouble with it being two words. Says that "../Drop: No such file or directory" and then "../Box: No such file or directory". <comment229374> From /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app, run the command:  chflags hidden /Users/Daniel/Drop\ Box/   Note the \ is necessary as there is a space in the folder name.
