Turn Off Calendar Alerts for Certain Calendars <body> I have several calendars that I need to view an access, but I don't necessarily want the alerts coming in for all of them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBoiQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to turn off all other notifications except my account (in green above)?  What about per calendar?  They are all Gmail accounts if that helps.  I have already tried this setting but it didn't make a difference.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/otiyq.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have also looked at the notification settings on each calendar in Gmail, which are showing codeNo reminders set/code  <answer199904> ol liOpen Calendar on your Mac./li liIn the left column list of calendars, right click (or command-I) on the calendar in question and "Get Info"/li liCheck the box labeled "Ignore alerts"/li liHit "OK"/li /ol
