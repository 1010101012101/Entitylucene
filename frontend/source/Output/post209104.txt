Why does the add text comment font change if I open the pdf in preview after editing on Adobe Reader <body> Why does the add text comment font change if I open the pdf in preview after editing on Adobe Reader?   I want to create a blank pdf page in the middle of my document. It seems like I can only do this on Preview. So I would add text comment in pdf reader, then open it on preview. However if my font was Helvetica on Adobe, it turns into typewriter font. How do I change it so the font is consistent across Adobe and Preview?   Please help!
