How to fix / Reset App Store app on Mac OSX - El Capitan <body> Newly upgraded to Latest released OS X - El Capitan (10.11.5). Now when I open App Store app, the spinning wheel to right of &lt;  buttons on upper left side continues to spin with no content visible below on any tab button. Originally, I saw that 1-update was available. I read an earlier note to use Activity Monitor and kill processes related to App Store. Saw 2 that had long process times (storeassetd, storedownloadd). Plus now see App Store Web Content in "(not responding state). How do I fix this???  <answer245419> ul liGo to Finder and press kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdG/kbd;/li liLocate code~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore/code and delete codecom.apple.appstore/code which are cache files;/li liThen press again those commands and go code/private/var/folders/code, open each folder and each subfolder until you find codecom.apple.appstore/code and delete this folder;/li liRestart your Mac. /li /ul  <comment302670> No such ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore directory exists. Nor does (terminal) /private/var/folders/ contain anything related to "com.apple.appstore". Will restart in a few minutes. Maybe this will correct things. <comment302713> Did all this. Doesn't seem to make a diff. No tab displays any content. Yet I was told a update was available. I selected Install. It went of to do something. Don't know what. <comment302714> Am I forced to reinstall??? <comment302740> Strange, they exist on my Mac. Ah, go only to `~/Library/Caches/` and find folders the `com.apple.appstore`, `storeaccount`, `storeassets`, `storedownload` and `storeinapp`. Delete these folders. Then go again to `/private/var/folders/`. At `/private/var/folders/`, there are two subfolders, go to the first subfolder and then go to that folder and after to the folder C that cointains the folder `com.apple.appstore`. <comment303061> I contacted Apple. They told me to delete the whole Caches folder at the location you mentioned. Cause a bunch of problems that just got resolved and a lot of time and a couple reboots. Its working now. Maybe I'll follow your suggestions to the letter from now on.
