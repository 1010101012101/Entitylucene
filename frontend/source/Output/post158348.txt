Does bundle sales add to the individual sales of the contained apps? <body> iTunes have recently released their App Bundle feature, but the documentation seems to be varying on how these actually work in terms of appstore sales.  I understand how the bundle works in essence, but what I am interested in knowing is how does this affect the individual app ranks, since the toplists are (mostly) sorted by number of downloads.  strongDoes each individual app get +1 download when the bundle is downloaded ?/strong If I could give all my apps a boosts by bundling them with more popular apps, this would be worth some discount.  strongDoes the bundle appear in the ranks as an individual product ?/strong Can I find myself competing against both apps and bundles in the top lists ?  PS: I hope AskDifferent is the right stack for this, but if not, please suggest where it should be instead.
