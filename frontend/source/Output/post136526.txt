Factory Resetting Phone w/ out computer <body> Today I went to:  Settings  General  Reset  Erase All Contents and Settings  I did this because I was told that would be the only way to get jailbreak off of my iPhone 5C. However, now my phone has been showing the white buffer icon for the past 2 and a half hours.  I didn't think it was suppose to take this long to restore my iPhone 5C back to its factory settings? Could it be because it's trying to delete the jailbreak? I really need to delete the jailbreak so I can update my IOS and other features on my iPhone.   P.S: My brothers friend jail broke my iPhone 5C this previous winter.   <answer136527> To remove the jailbreak it is advised to restore the iPhone from the computer, but as you have already reset it mannually I would suggest to download the latest firmware from here, and then put the phone iPhone into DFU mode. Open iTunes and press the restore button holding the kbdoption/kbd + strongRestore/strong if on a mac, or kbdShift/kbd + strongRestore/strong if on PC and select the downloaded ipsw file. This should remove the jailbreak and put you to the latest iOS version for your iPhone.  <comment161973> It's still showing the buffer icon. I was hoping to make a new icloud account after factory resetting my iPhone. Do I have to use iTunes to fix this or will the buffer icon eventually go away and turn back on? <comment161975> Buffer icon? have you tried the method I suggested and it's showing the icon or it is still continuing from the previous process? <comment162051> Yeah it's a black screen showing the buffer icon. Like you know the icon that shows up when a video is loading? It sort of looks like that. My iPhone won't connect to my laptop or computer. (I have Dells btw no Macs). <comment162057> Never mind! I got it to turn back on by holding the home, power, and volume + buttons. Now it's updating the IOS with Itunes. Thanks for your help!
