Transfer PDF in iBooks from iPhone to iPad <body> How do I transfer a PDF I've saved in iBooks from my iPhone 6 to my iPadPro?  Thanks  <answer238713> There are a couple of options.  strongIf you're using iCloud Drive/strong, opening emiBooks/em, scrolling to the item (a PDF, ePub or book) and tapping on the emDownload/em icon will download the item to your library. If you're not currently using emiCloud Drive/em you can always turn it on under strongSettings / iCloud / iCloud Drive/strong.   strongSyncing through a Computer/strong. If both devices are synced with the same computer, you could go into iTune's device's emSettings/em and enable emSync Books/em. Then syncing both devices would share the item. Bear in mind that if iTunes is set to emsync only selected books/em, you'll need to manually check the checkbox next to the PDF you want to sync.   strongSend the file attached to an Email/strong. Attaching the PDF to an email, opening it from the emother/em device and saving the PDF file into iBooks would do the trick, too.   <answer238723> Try upgrading your iPhone and iPad to the latest version of iOS (9.3 or later) and turning on strongiCloud for iBooks/strong. PDFs and books will automatically sync between your devices.  Also, Thecafremo provides some good ideas as well; email is a particularly good method as well.  <comment292799> It worked for the purchased book but not for the PDF <comment292804> @Mauro74 Right. I've updated the answer to provide more options.
