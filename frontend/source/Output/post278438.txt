Note you will need to re-add any non-default icons (i.e. apps) that you've added to the Dock - so you may want to take a screenshot of your Dock as a reminder of what you had there. (Or start afresh and only add things as you actually use them).  To reset and restart the Dock, follow these steps:  ul liGo to Finder/li liPress and hold the kbdoption/kbd key down/li liNow go to the Go menu/li liSelect the Library option to open the User's emLibrary/em folder. You can let go of the kbdoption/kbd key now./li liGo to the Preferences folder (i.e. within the Library folder)/li liFind and move the strongcom.apple.dock.plist/strong file to the Trash/li liNow open Terminal (usually located in Applications  Utilities)/li liEnter this command codekillall -KILL Dock/code/li liPress kbdenter/kbd/li /ul  This should resolve the issue. As mentioned previously, you will need to re-add non-default apps back to the Dock.
