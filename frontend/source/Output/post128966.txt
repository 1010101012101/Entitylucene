Why does secondary screen turns black when selecting "Mirror Display" <body> I have a MacBook Retina.  Whenever I attach a secondary screen, projector or monitor and select the "Mirror Displays" option, the secondary screen turns all black.  It does not matter what connection I use. I've tried the following, and they all have problems:  ul liMiniDisplay port to a Cinema Display/li liHDMI to HDTV/li liMiniDisplay - VGA/DVI converter - projector/li /ul  It does not matter what resolution I use.  It all started after connecting it to a projector, where all other presenters using PC was having similar problems.  <answer128972> I solved the problem by resetting NVRAM / PRAM:  ol liShut down your Mac./li liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down simultaneously in step 4./li liTurn on the computer./li liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys before the gray screen appears./li liHold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time./li liRelease the keys./li /ol
