Numbers no longer opens .xls spreadsheet <body> I have very recently converted to a MacBook Air from a PC and have a 1.3mb .xls file which 1 week ago Numbers happily opened, edited and saved in its own format.   Today, when I opened it it was corrupted. So I have been trying to open the original .xls file again and the Numbers message is simply 'the file will not open'. No explanation, no clues as to why.  I can still open another (very much smaller and simpler) .xls file but don't know what to do next...  <answer114428> I would say both files have somehow become corrupted and Numbers cannot recover from the errors.  I would try to restore the original file from a TimeMachine backup if you have one. If not this would be a good time to set up a TimeMachine backup, very very easy to do with a Mac and OS X.   I would also try opening the original xls file in OpenOffice or LibreOffice both of which are free.  <answer214985> My imperfect solution was to open up the XLS file in an old version of Numbers and then copy and pasted it into the current version. Total PITA but works.  <comment134095> I would try to restore the original file from a TimeMachine backup if you have one.  If not this would be a good time to set up a TimeMachine backup, very very easy to do with a Mac and OS X.  I would also try opening the original xls file in [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) both of which are free. <comment134096> What happens if you try opening the file by dragging it to a web browser with iWork for iCloud? That might rule out if the problem is numbers on your computer or if the file has been damaged. <comment134105> Thanks. Apache Open Office works just great, and seems a better spreadsheet app than Numbers too <comment134127> There is no doubt that OpenSource tools have come a long way and are excellent.
