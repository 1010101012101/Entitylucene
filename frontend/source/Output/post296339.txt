MRT Process using large unbounded amount of memory <body> Today my machine ran out of memory. I went to Activity Monitor and it showed a process called MRT using lots of memory. I restarted my machine hoping it would help, but even after a restart I see the memory on MRT climbing by about 0.01 GB every few seconds.  I'm on macOS Sierra 10.12.6 on MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), 16 GB RAM.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AUNaa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Seems like there are reports of MRT using high CPU and how to remove it here. But I'd rather not remove it because it scans for malware.  UPDATE: I even tried the steps documented in the link above under "Manually remove MRT" but it didn't seems to work, the MRT process is still running and growing in memory usage.  <answer296350> You might be able to "Fix" this by disabling many of the macOS malware protections as follows:   ol lidisable SIP/li limove the code/system/library/coreservices/MRT/code to recycle (delete should be ok). /li liquit MRT process if running./li /ol  Note that if you have malware, this will open the flood gates and remove any protections you might have had from Apple so be sure you are OK with those risks.  <answer296391> I had this same issue on my Mac mini &amp; MacBook Pro.  Mac mini was virtually unusable due to only 4GB RAM.  It is indeed malware.  I used the 30 day free trial of Malwarebytes and the malware was removed directly.  Hope this post helps people as I spent a few hours trying to find out the root cause of this MRT high memory use issue.  <answer296398> Three systems that work together to protect your Mac from malware are:  ul ligatekeeper/li liXProtect/li liMRT (probably stands for malware removal tool)/li /ul  So, these are Apple processes and if they are busy, the likely cause is you are infected or compromised. It could be a false positive, but you might consider enabling gatekeeper and sip if you disabled them and see if you can clean your system. If not, you might need a clean install that’s patched and then carefully get data back but not any programs or malware.  As a developer, I would use the gear icon in the window you show and while MRT is selected, run strongSystem Diagnostics.../strong and file a bug report / radar / escalate a support case to Apple Engineering so they can investigate if MRT has a memory leak - that's also very likely scenario if you are sure you're not needing malware removal every moment your Mac is running.   hr  Assuming you just want to see if you need cleaning (or for others that aren't developers and have similar issues), continue below  A great place to start if you don’t typically remove malware is MBAM - https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/  As always, be a little skeptical / aware of free tools since scam / snake oil software “protection or cleanup” tools are in fact compromising and malicious and untruthful about what they do. If you download something from free aggregators, you could even be tricked by something that isn’t the name it says on the file or description.   I would not disable MRT if you have it running hot unless you’re sure you’re not compromised.   <comment374292> I couldn't move the file to trash, I get error: “MRT” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by macOS." If I try to use `rm -rf` on it from Terminal I get error "Operation not permitted". And the path to it is `/System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app`. <comment374318> In your case, firstly, you need to disable System Integrity Protection.           1. Boot to Recovery OS by restarting your machine and holding down the Command and R keys at startup. 2. Launch Terminal from the Utilities menu. 3. Enter the following command:                                        $ csrutil disable                                                                                                     Then, quit MRT process, delete MRT file as mentioned above                         Finally, boot to recovery OS, in terminal,  $csrutil enable, restart MacBook <comment374343> I've edited the post to explain the risks - no judgement for people that want to experiment and modify - but we should warn people what they're doing in case they don't know what you are recommending. <comment374344> I'll answer in some detail - but the chorus of "me too" indicates that either there is a memory leak (although since you are in green for memory pressure - that leak looks to be exceptionally harmless) or that Apple is cracking down on some widespread malware and everyone is seeing the "immune system" kick into high gear. It's like everyone has a fever to fight off the same flu that's going around at the moment.
