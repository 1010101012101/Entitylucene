Copying unicode characters using Terminal.app <body> I have a text:  precodelSOfzºµÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈ /code/pre  When I double click on it, it is correctly highlighted as one object. However, when I do codeCmd-C/code and codeCmd-V/code in codeVim/code, following is pasted:  precodelSOfzÂºÂµÃ&lt;80&gt;Ã&lt;81&gt;Ã&lt;82&gt;Ã&lt;83&gt;Ã&lt;84&gt;Ã&lt;85&gt;Ã&lt;86&gt;Ã&lt;87&gt;Ã&lt;88&gt; /code/pre  This is in codeTerminal.app/code, in codeiTerm2/code this works. When I paste to codeZsh/code, I get:  precodelSOfz^V /code/pre  Again in codeiTerm2/code it works. In codeBash/code the pasting works correctly in both terminals.  Can this be configured to work in codeVim/code and codeZsh/code? Has it been maybe fixed in codeSierra/code (I'm using codeEl Captain/code) ?  <comment355235> Sierra user here, it works well (copying from your post and pasting in `Zsh`) <comment355544> @gmc: Thanks. Could you try vim too? <comment355565> [It works too](http://imgur.com/DYsoTrr)
