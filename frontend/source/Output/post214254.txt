Using an external merge tool does not work on SourceTree <body> I am running codeOS X.10/code, codeXcode 7/code and codeSourceTree 2/code.  When I select a conflicted file and codeLaunch an external merge tool/code, there is a window that appears very briefly... and then emnothing happens/em.  I tried (see this help page) codesudo ln -s /Developer/usr/bin/opendiff /usr/bin/opendiff/code but it did not work (I got the message codeln: /usr/bin/opendiff: File exists/code).  What should I do?  h2PS:/h2  Here is a picture of the window that briefly appears.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ara8F.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2PPS:/h2  Here are the SourceTree preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oqFFO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer215202> Assuming you are on latest version of SourceTree (Version 2.0.5.5 (2.0.5.5))  Try adding the following manually to your .gitconfig (or verify that SourceTree has put these exact lines)  precode[mergetool "sourcetree"]     cmd = /Applications/SourceTree.app/Contents/Resources/opendiff-w.sh \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\" -ancestor \"$BASE\" -merge \"$MERGED\"     trustExitCode = true /code/pre  <answer281784> My problem was that I was running a previous version of Xcode and I hadn't set the command line tools.   Select the tools in Xcode's preferences - locations:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aihII.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then run this command in terminal to verify:  precodegit config --global -l /code/pre  The git command will print out the path for the diff tool, amongst other config info. If it's not configured, it will output an error with something along the lines of the following:  precodexcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), /code/pre  <comment258732> Note that that help pages says it is for Xcode 4.2 and was written a few years ago - what version of Xcode do you have? Also anything that says chnage things in /usr/bin is a suspect source and now will not work in El Capitan. Also the error is because you already have /usr/bin/opendiff so the whole change is pointless <comment258733> Have you run Xcode and agreed to the licence terms <comment258736> I run Xcode 7 indeed! (but does this really make a difference?) <comment258737> Have you installed command line tools? What does /usr/bin/opendiff show when run in the terminal <comment258738> `2015-11-04 17:11:32.360 opendiff[10848:132187] too few arguments 2015-11-04 17:11:32.365 opendiff[10848:132187] usage: opendiff file1 file2 [-ancestor ancestorFile] [-merge mergeFile]`
