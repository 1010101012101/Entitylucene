The disk “Vol” couldn’t be ejected because “Terminal” is using it <body> I have connected an External hard disk to Mac and just issued command codedf -h/code in terminal. When I tried to eject drive it shows the error. After closing terminal, I could eject it. But is that really needed ? I didn't open any files in external disk. codedf -h/code just shows disk usage of all drives. Then how come terminal uses the drive and prevent from ejecting?  codeThe disk “Vol” couldn’t be ejected because “Terminal” is using it/code  <answer192297> If you cd- change directory to the mounted filesystem then you must cd out of the filesystem before you can eject it. As an example  precodecd; diskutil eject /Volumes/&lt;volume name&gt; /code/pre  cd: changes the current working directory to your home folder  diskutil: ejects the filesystem  <comment228707> If you didn't `cd` to the volume, how exactly did you run `df -h`? <comment228774> From my root prompt. I don't think it's necessary to cd to volume for running `df -h`. It list all connected volumes.
