Swap Used when there is unused Physical Memory <body> I'm running on OSX Yosemite and notice that although there is 7 GB of memory unused, there is still 130 MB of memory used for swap.  Are any apps actually using swap space, which I assume resides on my harddisk? Is this a situation to be concerned with, or is this normal?  I can't figure this out despite reading up on the memory statistics in Mac.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1f37.png" alt="enter image description here"
