How preconfigure os x install image for automatic install? <body> I want to build a custom system image of OS X (say ML). I want to install it on the virtual machine (not really important). I want a never-boot image (i.e. not a preinstalled image) fully configured.  Under strongconfiguration/strong I mean:  ol liadditional strongpackages/strong (applications) /li lisystem strongpreferences/strong (background image, language, keyboard, hot-keys, network config, change default MAC-addr. etc.)/li /ol  So I would like to repack the installESD.dmg (from OS X Install Disk) so that it unpack the content and configure the installed system while the installation (better not after the system already installed = prepare all preferences in the image) All the tools like codemunki, simian, ard, deploystudio, casper, absolute manage/code, etc. are doing only the 1) part of what I want (only adding/removing packages + unattended install). But I never see smth. related to the second part (preconfigured preferences included to the install image). codeInstaDMG/code could be the solution, but I don't see any manual/tutorial for such a task I need.  Does somebody know a possible walkthrough for the kind of task?  h1Update:/h1  I found now some interesting tutorials (did not completed them yet, but will do next time):  ul lihttp://wiki.afp548.com/index.php/Create_a_Mac_OS_X_with_InstaDMG_and_InstaUp2Date/li lihttp://www.coolestguyplanettech.com/osx-10-8-mountain-lion-instadmg-first-boot-part-3//li /ul
