Folder in root greyed out in Finder but accessible in Terminal <body> I've just migrated from an old MBP to a new one. I had a folder codeTransmachina/code in the root in which I keep a large SVN working copy. I just copied this over with codecp -R/code but on the new machine this folder is greyed out in Finder, and I can't navigate into it.  In terminal, I can access it fine as my user (no codesudo/code) and the permissions are:  precodedrwxr-xr-x   56 nic   wheel    Transmachina /code/pre  which are the same as on the old machine. Both are running 10.8.2, but the old machine was 10.5 when originally purchased and configured.  Update: codexattr -l Transmachina/code doesn't show anything at all.  Any ideas on how I can fix this?  <answer70444> I found my answer here: http://stephenmonro.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/the-best-file-management-utility-for-mac-osx/  Use a command like this on the folder:  codeSetFile -d 06/13/2011 PATH//code  <comment80175> Does `xattr -l` show any extended attributes? <comment80201> What is the name of the folder? <comment80302> I've updated the question with the folder name "Transmachina" - it's not a reserved name or anything <comment81763> Thanks! To be fair the author found the solution at http://macadmins.psu.edu/news/2011/06/grayed_out_finder_folder <comment99159> Especially since the original link has disappeared, it's worth pointing out that the SetFile command is part of the XCode command-line tools.
