How do I uninstall old SDKs? <body> I recently upgraded to Apple OS X 10.8 but I observed the following folders in code/Developer/SDKs/code:  ul liMacOSX10.5.sdk/li liMacOSX10.6.sdk/li /ul  I googled and found out that I should run codesudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all/code.   However I forgot the code--mode=all/code and now I still have the SDK folders but the uninstall-devtools script has gone. I have also installed Xcode 4.5.2 but it seems that it does not come with the command line tool called codeuninstall-devtools/code.   How can I get rid of the old SDKs?  <answer75249> The installer for Xcode 4.3 had an option for removing older versions of Xcode which removed /Developer/.  You can probably just delete the folder completely. It was possible to delete single developer folders even before Xcode 4.3. From an answer by Chris Espinosa on Stack Overflow:     If you have multiple Developer folders, you can drag any of them to the trash without damaging the others. Developer folders are completely standalone.
