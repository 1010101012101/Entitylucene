Close pinned tabs without unpinning them (safari) <body> I use Pandora radio a lot and like to keep it pinned in safari. It works great, the only issue is that when I want to close Pandora without closing safari, there's no way to do it without unpinning it.   (hitting either strongunpin tab/strong or strongclose tab/strong will close and unpin the tab)  Any idea how to close the tab, yet leave it pinned?
