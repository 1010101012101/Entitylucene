check for malicious process <body> Is there a way to have all my running processes checked for malicious software?   I have used an online service some time ago where I could upload a list of all processes and have them analyzed. You create the list like this in terminal:  precodeps aux &gt; outputfile.txt /code/pre  I already googled the hell out of it but I cannot find it again. Maybe somebody knows what I'm talking about and can point me to it. Different solutions welcome as well.  Thanks!
