Export / Backup emails on iPad (Locally only) <body> My email was hacked. The hacker deleted all the emails on the server and are unrecoverable.  I have the emails still sitting on my iPad which was originally connected through IMAP. I need to get these emails back.  How can I export these emails from my iPad locally without allowing a reconnection to the server (which would lose them all again)?  Edit: I have little experience with iPads in general. Are there are mail apps that I could download that would do a sync with the local emails that would then allow an export? (Clutching at straws here!)  <answer211502> ol liConnect and Sync your iPad with a Windows/Mac iTunes installed machine. /li liCreate a backup./li liOpen the backup and find the mail folder./li /ol  The iPad mail client stores the emails as an SQLite database (at least it used to) so you should be able to use any SQLite client to open the same.   <comment255518> Thanks for your suggestion. Unfortunately the client took the decision to just delete the emails and start afresh. I will accept your answer though
