Open recently closed page on iOS <body> I know on iPad you can press and hold the new tab button to re-open recently closed tabs, but is there any similar functionality on an iPod/iPhone?  <answer45995> Hate to provide what is effectively a 1 word answer, but no.  Because iPhone Safari does not use tabs, the shortcut/gesture is missing.  Going into the 'codeother pages/code' screen and tapping and holding all over yeilds nothing.  Simply not available using Safari.  You may have more luck with a 3rd party browser if it's an important bit of functionality to have.  <answer46019> You cannot reopen the last closed page Safari iOS iPhone/iPod directly.  But you can still use the history to retrieve recently visited pages.  <comment52610> Alright, that's what I thought. Problem is all the 3rd party browsers are rated 18+, but I'll have to look into that.
