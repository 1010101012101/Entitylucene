How to run a script from Alfred or Spotlight or any run dialog? <body> Coming from Linux I am really missing the good old gmrun -- a run dialog which recognizes your code$PATH/code and allows you to execute any script in it without needing to open up a terminal. It does the job and get out of the way immediately.  I am wondering if I can make Alfred or spotlight do the same thing, or perhaps find another tool?  h3Update 1/h3  I have tried Dterm, but it keeps asking me for accessibility permissions, which I have already granted.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IyDxk.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3Update 2/h3  ul liI have solved the above problem by going to privacy settings and check DTerm manually there:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TqrBc.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liIt's working right now, but not as smoothly as I would expect: the run dialog is still there after the command is issued, it would be much better if the window gets hidden./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zIkVN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer139578> h1Dterm/h1  You might want to take a look at Dterm. This is a dialog under kbdcommand/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdreturn/kbd and does exactly what you are looking for and it does even more than that.   As it says on the site:  "emDTerm provides a context-sensitive command line that makes it fast and easy to run commands on the files you're working with and then use the results of those commands./em"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tzH2t.png" alt="ping test Dterm"  <answer139605> Type the command in DTerm, press enter, then press Esc. As @CousinCocaine suggested.  <comment164540> It sounds great, but I am having trouble with granting permissions, please see my edit to the question. <comment164547> You can close the Dterm window by a left click anywhere on your screen (as long it is outside the dterm window) or press shift-command-return or press `esc`. (press `command comma` for Dterm settings). As the Dterm website states: When you're done, hit escape or just go on about your work, and it'll automatically fade out, leaving your screen clutter-free. <comment164548> A window screenshot is made by pressing `command shift 4`, release all, then tap `spacebar`, and then left-click to snap a photo. <comment164549> And try not to change the original question as that will make all answers obsolete. If you have a new question, just create a new question instead of updating the previous one.
