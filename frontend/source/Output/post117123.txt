Updating Word for Mac 2011 Themes to Match Word for Windows 2013 <body> Is there an expedited method of matching the default theme used in Mac Word 2011 to the theme that is used in Windows Word 2013?  The default formatting scheme used in Word 2013, for Windows, is so much better thought out then the default theme used in Word 2011, for Mac.  I would like to update my default theme in Word 2011 so that it uses the same settings (or as close to as possible) as what Mac 2013 would use.  I have attempted opening a document produced in Windows and saving the theme to a file, then loading that theme into a new Mac Word document.  This updates a some things, but does not everything... e.g.:  ul liFont Face: Yes/li liFont Size: No/li liFont Color: Yes/li liParagraph: No (not any settings)/li /ul  Is there a more accurate method of export the more modern 2013/Windows settings into 2011/Mac?
