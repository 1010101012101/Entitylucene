How to control playback speed of iTunes U lectures in Mac OS? <body> I try to learn swift and opened iTunes U lectures in iTunes on Mac. I wonder how can i change playback speed? It is easy on iPad, but i have no idea how to do this while playing videos in iTunes on Mac  <answer266108> It is currently not possible in iTunes. I highly recommend you to give feedback about this feature to Apple.  However there is a workaround:  ol liDownload VLC/li /ol     VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and   framework that plays most multimedia files as well as DVD, Audio CD,   VCD, and various streaming protocols.   ol start="2" liRight click on the file in iTunes and choose "Show in Finder"/li liOpen the file shown in Finder with VLC/li liIn the menu "Playback" you can find the "Playback Speed" settings./li /ol  <answer270183> If you're trying to speed it up, press the fast-forward button (connected two right pointing arrows). It continues to play audio and video, but at 2x-60x speed.   I don't know of any native method for playing at 0.5x, 1.5x, or any other speed slower than 2x.
