water in my macbook webcam, is it lost? <body> I have a MBP Retina 15' (mid 2012) and recently I was caught by surprise under the rain. My macbook was in a bag but still some water managed to get inside.   The only damage I can see so far is that the webcam doesn't work anymore, I can even see drops of moisture in it.  Since MBP retinas are very hard to fix, should I consider the webcam lost or can I do something about it? I'm relatively new to OSX and I dont know how to do a proper assessment of the situation.
