Renaming an advanced voice command in OS X Yosemite dictation <body> Is there any way to rename an advanced voice command?  For example, I would like to rename the advanced voice command "copy that" to "copy" without having to disable the built-in advanced voice command "copy that" and creating a new voice command "copy".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHry9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment247820> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247821> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
