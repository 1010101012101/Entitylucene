Have you tried `man netstat`? What else have you tried? You should edit your question to include commands you've tried, the output you received, and what you expected to receive. <comment331756> I am able to get Recv-Q,Send-Q ,Local Address,Foreign Address and State. <comment331757> Can you edit your question to include that info, including how you did it? And add what information you still need, what commands you've tried, what output you received, and what output you expected. <comment331758> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/117644/how-can-i-list-my-open-network-ports-with-netstat/117648  i was try this solution <comment331763> OK, so edit your question to add something like: "I've tried `netstat -atp tcp | grep -i "listen"` (from http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/117644/how-can-i-list-my-open-network-ports-with-netstat/117648) but the output was: `...show output...` and I was expecting `...show expected output...`."
