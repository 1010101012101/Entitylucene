App Store "An Unknown Error Has Occurred", Apple Support fix was only temporary. How fix permanently? <body> When opening an application installed from the App Store (TextWrangler) I am prompted to sign in. After entering the correct Apple ID and password I get an error, codeAn unknown error has occurred/code. This only happens with one app, other apps installed are OK.  This error also occurs when I sign in to the App Store. So its not just affecting a single application.  This also seems to be affecting my iCloud login. It prompts for a password then just seems to hang.  I spoke with Apple Support yesterday. They had me delete emall/em Caches from /Libary/Caches, ~/Library/Caches, and a few cookies then restart my iMac. This fixed the issue yesterday. Today I start my Mac and get the same error again. I called Apple Support and got the runaround, I was told to use ExpressLane which doesn't really seem to have a solution.  How can I permanently fix this error?  Previous attempt to identify/triage the error  Searching online turns up similar suggestions to clear caches and cookies, but also some more extreme suggestions involving network settings that I am hesitant to try.

Another forum post describing similar issues suggested deleting code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist/code. I backed that file up, deleted it, and restarted. I can now log in and out of AppStore, access all of my AppStore purchased apps, and it 'sticks' across shutdowns and restarts.  Process is pretty simple, I'll spell it out for future reference:  ol liOpen Terminal/li licodecd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code/li licodecp NetworkInterfaces.plist ~/NetworkInterfaces.plist.bak/code - Make a hasty backup in your home directory/li licodesudo rm NetworkInterfaces.plist/code delete the original/li liRestart your Mac/li liOpen AppStore and try to sign in. It should work./li /ol  Apparently this works because the MAC address is used as part of the receipt/authorization process.  <answer80946> Same thing happened to me, and this was how I have fixed it: http://yasar.senturk.name.tr/blog/2012/09/26/hackintosh-app-store-an-unknown-error-has-occurred-fix/  1- Edit /Extra/org.chameleon.Boot.plist and add following lines:  precode&lt;key&gt;EthernetBuiltIn&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  2- Go to System Preferences, and then Network. Remove all network adapters.  3- Delete /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist and reboot computer.  4- Go to System Preferences, and then Network. Click on + button, select “Ethernet” from “Interface” combo box, then click OK.  5- Reboot computer.  6- Go to System Preferences, and then Network. Click on + button, select “WiFi” from “Interface” combo box, then click OK.  <answer194683> What worked for me was to go to strongStoreSign Out/strong  Once I was signed out, I was able to sign back in and purchase/install apps correctly. Not sure why this happened, but it fixed it for me.  <answer284750> As an Apple/Mac repair person, I was baffled by the "An error has occurred couldn't communicate with helper app" dialog when trying to use the App store to do a software app. I read through these thread and tried deleting App Store and Network prefs with no success. Also reinstalled OS with no luck.  strongHere's what worked:/strong Do a Safe Boot (hold kbdshift/kbd key while booting), then go to App store and try downloading/installing updates. It worked and the problem disappeared when the Mac rebooted.  <comment73927> Have you tried uninstalling TextWrangler by removing it from Launchpad or removing other files related to it? <comment73930> @Lri Yes I have. That actually exacerbated the problem yesterday. After removing it I could not sign in to the App Store to reinstall it. <comment73931> Does `mdfind -name textwrangler` still show some files? Removing an application from Launchpad runs `uninstalld` which might affect the way App Store sees the application. <comment73932> Edited, "This error also occurs when I sign in to the App Store. So its not just affecting a single application." <comment75391> Check what the error logs say. Applications  Utilities  Console. <comment75401> @duci9y - See link in the original question. The Console does not show any errors. <comment75407> Can you post the logs? Just wait for the error to occur and then quickly go to Console and copy over the last 100 messages. <comment75591> Does it work if you log in (with your username/password) to the App Store on somebody else's mac and try downloading an app? What about if you use your own mac but from a different internet connection? (perhaps 3G tethering is the easiest way to test the latter) <comment75667> Works from my MacBook on the same internet connection as the iMac. <comment75668> @duci9y - I was able to get something from the logs. See OP <comment75678> Which version of OS X are you on? I have read that 10.8.1 fixes this issue. <comment75693> OS X 10.8.1 (12B19) <comment75697> For other reasons I had to reboot my iMac, after rebooting this problem does not occur. It seems to be related to a hard shutdown (which I do every night) but seems to fix itself after a reboot. <comment75912> Just got the update to OS X 10.8.2 and still get `9/20/12 9:12:19.780 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[201]: ([0x0-0x44044].com.barebones.textwrangler[417]) Exited with code: 173`. So the problem seems to fix itself with a reboot but comes back after a full shutdown. Bounty is still out there! <comment76189> Happened again today. This time when trying to download the iPhoto update. Console does not show any errors. <comment76220> have you repaired permissions? If so, what about creating a new user account (with the same iCloud acct)? <comment76230> any firewalls or anything that might hinder the iMac from your network connection?  check that or Renew DHCP Lease <comment76430> Out of curiosity, where is NetworkPreferences.plist? <comment76533> @ethanlee16 - Edited my answer, its in `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration`. <comment88432> This didn't work for me, unfortunately. <comment88756> @AlexKaushovik - Were you experiencing the same problem my original question posed? <comment93342> How does this answer differ from the accepted one (besides the first step which is specific to Hackintosh'ed models)? <comment93404> Because the accepted answer is working only for some Hackintosh models while this one is working for others. Since original question doesn't indicate that if it was a Hackintosh or not, I wanted to write the solution worked for me. <comment93405> The fact that the asker called Apple Support seems to indicate that Hackintoshes are not involved here at all... <comment93429> You are right. I didn't notice. My bad. <comment152050> This *did* work for me. <comment279438> PERFECT solution. It worked. Thank you.
