What is the best way (if any) to stop low battery notifications <body> Ok I admit, this question will be part rant. Why Apple thinks we are too stupid to check the batteries when our mouse or keyboard stops working (and would rather pester us incessantly) is beyond me.  These notifications are incredibly annoying and I am seriously considering investigating buying a Microsoft device if this isn't fixed in the next macOS release.   Is there an easy way to turn them off?   <comment336703> What makes you think Microsoft devices don't have battery notifications? <comment336707> Why don't you just carry spare batteries with you? I do. You think it's annoying on a computer, try it on a camera halfway through a day's shoot... no spares, no shoot. Get rechargeable, 2 sets, so one is always ready.
