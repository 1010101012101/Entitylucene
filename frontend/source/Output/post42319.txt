Is there a keyboard shortcut to show/open the Trash? <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut for the Trash? I know how to create one, but I want to know if there's a built-in shortcut. To clarify, this is to emshow/em the Trash, not to empty it.  <answer42321> According to Apple there is no native shortcut to open Trash.  <answer42341> If you are using a Spotlight or a program such as Quicksilver that allows you configure keyboard shortcuts to perform actions. Here is a solution, create an AppleScript run only Application that will open the trash can for you. Its not a built in command but is should fit the bill nicely and you can do it all with built it tools.  ol liOpen AppleScript Editor /li liOpen a new script editor window if one did not already open./li liEnter the follow in to the blank editor window  precodetell application "Finder"     open trash     end tell /code/pre/li liTest the script, press Run, trash should open./li liSave the Script with the name "OpenTrash" make sure to select "strongFile Format:/strong" strongemApplication/em/strong and strongcheck/strong the "strongRun Only/strong" option./li liOpen the newly saved OpenTrash Application, trash can contents should open in the Finder. /li /ol  Introduce it to your favorite program launcher, and set up keyboard shortcuts etc. Also note that spotlight should index it as well and you can use that to open the Trash can now too.  kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdspace/kbd  and then search for "Tr"... Then press kbdenter /kbd once "OpenTrash" is highlighted.   <answer42360> A very poor man's solution would be to just use kbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd in Finder to open code~/.Trash/code.  <comment84062> The solution by MrDaniel does work for me, but without checking "Run Only" option and in the simple script format. Otherwise, every time I hit the shortcut (I use BetterTouchTool for that), I get the dialog window "Hit Enter to run this script". Also one major drawback is that the shortcut works only in Finder, it's not global for some reason. <comment84071> That page is missing some shortcuts, and it doesn't specifically say that there's no shortcut for opening the trash. <comment150472> you can even assign an icon to the new "trash" app, very nice, best solution <comment175688> I hate touching my trackpad if I can avoid it, but I'm not about to type eleven characters just to avoid clicking on the dock. <comment336479> using this technique (had to remind myself) - https://support.apple.com/kb/PH13922?locale=en_US
