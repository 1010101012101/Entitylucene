How to avoid auto-disable Low Power Mode on iOS9 when charging <body> In iOS9, when Low Power Mode is activated, and you are charging your iPhone, when charge percentage gets to 80%, the iPhone disables Low Power Mode automatically.  Is there any way to avoid this automatic change and let Low Power Mode remain activated?  <answer232260> Just tested this - you can get Siri to turn low power on which saves navigating to the Battery settings screen. Just ask Siri to "Turn on low power mode"  <comment250015> While I'm short on testing it, you can manually switch the low power mode in "Settings"  "Battery". It's worth a shot trying to manually enable it to see if it keeps it enabled then. Many times a suggested or automatic feature can be made permanent by manually changing its state. <comment253212> I am not asking to do it manually, I am asking to do it automatically. <comment253213> What I meant to say here was that some options, which had been toggled once manually may retain the setting afterwards. <comment253214> Is not working. You have to turn manually the switch everytime you charge your phone. <comment253226> Ok. Fair enough. As I initially stated, I was short on testing it here, so just a suggestion from other functions I've seen working like that. Back to the drawing board then.
