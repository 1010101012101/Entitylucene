Can't sync all iBooks from mac to other devices <body> I have done everything possible, starting from reading this : https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202759  I have set the sync option on the mac , and also on the iPhone/iPad.  When I buy a book strongoutside/strong the emApple store/em, i put it on my mac, then I would like to be able to see it on iPhone/iPad iBooks , but I just don't see it.  It would be wonderful if I could start reading on the mac and move to the iPhone.  Is it possible ?   <answer249200>    Yes, it's possible.      The article you linked to applies only to books from iTunes Store. In   order to sync your books and PDFs outside of the iTunes Store you need   an iOS device running iOS 9.3 or later and/or a Mac running Mac OS X   10.11.4 (El Capitan) or later. You may update from App Store or iTunes.

Yes it is, the question is how can one simply start reading on the iPad and continue on the iPhone. Such a simple thing to ask from Apple.
