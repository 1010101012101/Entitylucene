Would I receive a confirmation email when I turn off iCloud backup? <body> Will I receive a confirmation email (to Gmail, the email I registered my device) in case I turn off the iCloud backup function on my device?  <answer270293> No, you will not receive an email.  <comment339615> What has your research show so far? Have you tried it? <comment339652> @Tetsujin This isn't something that can be tested trivially, since it would require you to actually disable your iCloud backup to test.
