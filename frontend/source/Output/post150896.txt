SHA1 hash for OSX 10.10 Yosemite public release? <body> I have a less-than-reliable internet connection, so my download of Yosemite over the App Store has been broken over several tries. I would like to know if my download is intact. If you can run this command in Terminal:  precodeshasum /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg /code/pre  and share your result. This way we can agree on what a clean copy looks like.  <answer150900> Why not check the signature instead?  That way, you won't have to rely on an external checksum.  Here's an example of this done with a Mavericks installer (I don't have the Yosemite installer yet):  precode$ codesign -dvvv Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/ Executable=…/Install OS X Mavericks.app/Contents/MacOS/Install OS X Mavericks Identifier=com.apple.InstallAssistant.Mavericks Format=bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64) CodeDirectory v=20100 size=285 flags=0x200(kill) hashes=7+3 location=embedded Hash type=sha1 size=20 CDHash=9bf12663fe5f73d2780eb2badc2fe7a86a2c7164 Signature size=4169 Authority=Apple Mac OS Application Signing Authority=Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority Authority=Apple Root CA Info.plist entries=30 TeamIdentifier=not set Sealed Resources version=1 rules=14 files=80 Internal requirements count=1 size=124 /code/pre  <answer150908> I run your request and here is the result.  precodeeebf02a20ac27665a966957eec6f5e6fe3228a19  /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg /code/pre  And for Yosemite 10.10.1 the shasum is:  precodea673c2c6d967f4da2934b7d6cf3736936970b194 /code/pre  Please wait about a minute or two for Terminal to get the number.  <answer197599> You can use apple's digital signature check , as shown here  https://support.apple.com/en-ap/HT202369  <answer246331> Complementing the accepted answer for 10.10 …  hr  h210.10.1/h2  Version 1.6.7 (1014) of emInstall OS X Yosemite.app/em  a673c2c6d967f4da2934b7d6cf3736936970b194  hr  h210.10.2/h2  Version 1.6.10 (1017) of the app  059f2603a91465bcee24c864d446da30df920f85  Please note, that differs from revision 2 of the accepted answer; the result added to that revision was truly for 10.10.em1/em.  hr  h210.10.3/h2  Version 1.6.16 (1023) of the app  dc4d4d0a7cd4aea4514025d23a58d05107369fa9  hr  h210.10.5/h2  Version 1.6.43 (1043) of the app, downloaded from App Store first on Sunday 2016-07-17, again on 2016-07-18  0e063fd87d5b0a4f68dbd35da95b2018748f88eb  At https://github.com/drduh/OS-X-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/blob/master/InstallESD_Hashes.csv and from commentary under the accepted answer:   ef5cc8851b893dbe4bc9a5cf5c648c10450af6bc  Concerning the discrepancy: https://github.com/drduh/OS-X-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/125  hr  h2Records of my checks for .5/h2  precodeMashemite:Desktop grahamperrin$ cd /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/ Mashemite:SharedSupport grahamperrin$ shasum InstallESD.dmg 0e063fd87d5b0a4f68dbd35da95b2018748f88eb  InstallESD.dmg Mashemite:SharedSupport grahamperrin$ sw_vers ProductName:    Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.12 BuildVersion:   16A239m Mashemite:SharedSupport grahamperrin$ /code/pre  – and with reference to Mac OS X: How to verify a SHA-1 digest - Apple Support:   precodeMashemite:SharedSupport grahamperrin$ openssl sha1 InstallESD.dmg  SHA1(InstallESD.dmg)= 0e063fd87d5b0a4f68dbd35da95b2018748f88eb Mashemite:SharedSupport grahamperrin$  /code/pre  h2The record of my checks for .3, .2 and .1/h2  precode$ sudo zfs mount zhandy                          /Volumes/zhandy $ pwd /Volumes/zhandy/chronological/OS X/10/10/3/1.6.16 (1023)/Install OS X Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport $ time shasum InstallESD.dmg dc4d4d0a7cd4aea4514025d23a58d05107369fa9  InstallESD.dmg 13.47user 2.21system 4:25.25elapsed 5%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 6864maxresident)k 11084834inputs+0outputs (0major+762minor)pagefaults 0swaps $ cd /Volumes/zhandy/chronological/OS\ X/10/10/2/1.6.10\ \(1017\)/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/ $ time shasum InstallESD.dmg 059f2603a91465bcee24c864d446da30df920f85  InstallESD.dmg 12.66user 2.03system 3:52.58elapsed 6%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 6732maxresident)k 10182180inputs+0outputs (0major+760minor)pagefaults 0swaps $ cd /Volumes/zhandy/chronological/OS\ X/10/10/1/1.6.7\ \(1014\)/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/ $ time shasum InstallESD.dmg a673c2c6d967f4da2934b7d6cf3736936970b194  InstallESD.dmg 12.39user 1.95system 3:36.28elapsed 6%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 6804maxresident)k 10159544inputs+0outputs (0major+762minor)pagefaults 0swaps $ sudo zpool status [sudo] password for grahamperrin:    pool: zhandy  state: ONLINE status: The pool is formatted using a legacy on-disk format.

Can you elaborate? <comment177595> Thanks. I will be able to collaborate that in "6 hours 43 minutes", then I will check the answer. <comment177611> Yep. This is the same result for me. <comment177766> A digital signature is a way to verify that a file hasn't been tampered with or is corrupted, and will become invalid if it is. A digital signature is based on cryptography and is designed to be very hard to fake. <comment178005> How would you tell if it's invalid? I ran this command on the OS X Yosemite installer, then tried adding a file to the .app directory, and also tried modifying version.plist, and the output of this command did not change. <comment206145> what does it mean if i got a different result? i got this: 059f2603a91465bcee24c864d446da30df920f85 /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg <comment206154> @Amanda Which Yosemite are you trying to use (Version ?) <comment206463> @Buscar웃 I'm using Yosemite on MacPro 2011 <comment206464> Welcome to Ask Different!

For the .app that contains the image, what is the version and build? <comment303763> @HenrikN that should be a great question; if you find it (or [make it, yourself](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/asking)) please share a link. <comment303764> @Amanda thank you for drawing attention to the discrepancy. It led to revision of the answer. <comment303817> @GrahamPerrin This was two years ago, so I'm not motivated to do so, but go for it if you like :) <comment303860> @GrahamPerrin I don't have the file/app available anymore so I can't verify, but other references point to the same hash I posted earlier, e.g. https://github.com/drduh/OS-X-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/blob/master/InstallESD_Hashes.csv
