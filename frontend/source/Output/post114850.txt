Applescript for moving recently added files (not created or modified) to another folder? <body> I would like to get a recent downloaded codepdf/code file ( !: it corresponds to the Finder sort method codeDate Added/code, not codeDate Created/code nor codeDate Modified/code) and either just moving to one another folder (if using plain AppleScript) or ask the user to perform this action (if using FolderActions).  So the idea is to move some new downloaded pdf files to another location.  Is it possible with either AppleScript or with FolderActions or anyhow? Are there any examples for that?  <answer129747> The answer depends on what version of OSX you are running.  Snow Leopard doesn't appear to store Date Added or Creation Date of files.  precode$ stat -x testfile    File: "testfile"   Size: 7            FileType: Regular File   Mode: (0644/-rw-r--r--)         Uid: (  501/ vic)  Gid: (   20/   staff) Device: 14,2   Inode: 12130091    Links: 1 Access: Mon May  5 21:49:18 2014 Modify: Mon May  5 21:49:15 2014 Change: Mon May  5 21:49:15 2014 /code/pre  For Lion and later, there are a couple of ways that Google revealed:  Try the following code  taken from   https://discussions.apple.com/message/23974953#23974953  precodetell application "Finder"     set latestFile to item 1 of (sort (get files of (path to downloads folder)) by creation date) as alias     set fileName to latestFile's name     log "Created/Added Date: " &amp; (get creation date of latestFile) end tell /code/pre  Alternatively have a look at the code that uses the codemdls/code command line tool as shown here  https://secure.macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=37910  Unfortunately I am running Snow Leopard and cannot test the above.  <answer129959> Finder and System Events file objects only have codedate modified/code and codedate created/code properties as of 10.9.
