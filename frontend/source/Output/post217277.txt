Running Application From External Hardrive on a mac <body> I have copied my application to external my hard drive but when I run it it copies the application to the application folder on the mac and then runs.   <answer217281> Have you considered moving the copy of the application from your /Applications folder to maybe a temporary folder (or delete it, if you have a copy of that application already on your external HD) to see if that resolves the issue?  Also, can I ask what application it is and what version of Mac OS you're running?  <comment262673> As well as the OS Version, can you tell us what App you're running?
