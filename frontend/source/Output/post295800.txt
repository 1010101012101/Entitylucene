Printing from Sierra to a shared printer on Windows 10 <body> I want to print to a printer attached to a Windows 10 machine. I tried setting up a workgroup then selecting the Windows tab for adding a printer, but this does not seem to work. It can submit a job to the print queue and I can see it on my Windows 10 machine, but it immediately disappears. Is there another method that I can use instead?  <comment373580> Does printing in general work on the Window 10 machine - in other words, can you print a test document from Windows? <comment373587> @Allan Yes I can print on the Windows machine <comment373588> Enable logging for the printer and see what's happening - instructions can be found here:    https://superuser.com/questions/959751/windows-10-enable-logging-for-printing
