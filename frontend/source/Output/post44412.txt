Disable Command-W in the terminal <body> Is there any way to disable kbdCommand/kbd+kbdW/kbd in the terminal?   On several occasions I have accidentally closed a terminal window containing important information when I meant to close a Safari tab and did not realize that the terminal was the active window.  <answer44413> You can set a prompt before closing in the preferences:  strongTerminal Preferences &#x2192; Settings &#x2192; Shell/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VMQGN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44414> Goto Keyboard System Preferences and select "Keyboard Shortcuts". Then choose emApplication Shortcuts/em from the left and click em+/em. Choose "Terminal.app" and enter a menu item that is not that critical. I chose "Bring All to Front". Then click into emKeyboard Shortcut/em and hit kbdCMD/kbd+kbdW/kbd. Click emOK/em.  Using this technique have have successfully redirected the kbdCMD/kbd+kbdW/kbd shortcut in Terminal.  <answer44415> To disable kbd⌘/kbdkbdW/kbd in Terminal, do the following:  ul liFrom the  menu in the top left corner of the screen, select strongSystem Preferences/strong. Click on strongKeyboard/strong then strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong then strongApplication Shortcuts/strong. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eA1nt.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the + button to add a new shortcut/li liSelect "Terminal.app" for the application, and for the command, type codeClose Window/code (this is case sensitive). In the shortcut box, give it a different shortcut, like kbd⌘/kbdkbdControl/kbdkbdW/kbd img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cP4ZI.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNow kbd⌘/kbdkbdW/kbd will not close your terminal windows./li /ul  <answer101145> I propose this:  In iTerm: Open PreferencesKeys At the bottom of "Global Shortcut Keys" click "+", then type Cmd-W and leave the default Action "Ignore".  ul lino need to manipulate global settings/li lino need to confirm conscious closing/li /ul  <answer103217> I tried all of the above, and none worked for me.  What worked was changing the shortcut for the strong"Close"/strong command.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PEmIb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer186041> Also worth mentioning BetterTouchTool (http://www.bettertouchtool.net/)  I wanted to have both kbd⌘/kbdkbdW/kbd  &amp; kbd⌘/kbdkbdC/kbd both perform codeCopy/code (muscle memory, don't ask).  The native method only allows you one key per command, with BTT I was able to have both keys mapped to same command, while also avoid the undesired Close WIndow behaviour  <comment50465> Answers crossed paths. This is a good one too. <comment50466> I mis-spoke in my question. I actually meant to prevent closing a tab, but your answer still works well with the slight change of "Close Window" to "Close Tab". BTW, thanks for the **VERY** complete answer. <comment50526> @Daniel: Nice screenshots! May I ask which program you used to take them? Or did you change your desktop background to all-white? <comment50529> The program is called "Mac OS X" :-) Command-shift-4, spacebar, click in the window. <comment50565> I think this is the best solution for this particular use case. Disabling standard shortcuts makes me feel icky and would get frustrating when muscle-memory kicks in when I *want* to close a terminal tab/window. <comment126452> Same here. "Close" worked for me but "Close Windows" did not. <comment144139> Ian, it says "iterm" not "TERMINAL" <comment144168> @LM126, yep, my example is using iTerm2, so not sure what your on about? <comment144680> -1: OP asked a very specific question that could easily be modified for various applications. This is a Terminal.app specific answer which does not answer the question. <comment169170> For those using iTerm go to Prefrerences - Profiles - Session - Prompt before closing! Make sure you are on the correct profile (your default one has the star!) http://images.luo.ma/osx/iterm/preferences-session-always-prompt-before-closing.jpg <comment223568> This is the only effective solution for me on Mac OS 10.10 <comment348981> My system is Sierra, and I change the `Close Window` to the `Close`, it works for me. Thanks.
