Applescript to open Get Info box for the previous iTunes track? <body> I like having a hotkey to bring up the get info box for the current iTunes track so that if I'm using another app and a song comes up, I can quickly edit it.  This works (though if it's not the best way, please let me know):  precodetell application "iTunes"     activate     reveal current track end tell tell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         key code 34 using command down     end tell end tell /code/pre  I've assigned that a hotkey in BetterTouchTool and it's great.  I'd like to have a version of that script to edit the previous song...  but changing "current track" to "previous track" causes a completely different result.  iTunes goes back to play the previous track again even though I only told it to reveal it, and then I get an error saying applescript can't continue reveal.  precodetell application "iTunes"     activate     reveal (previous track) end tell /code/pre  What's the easiest way to get iTunes to show the previous track in a playlist using Applescript?  <answer161351> You can in a round about way using the "Recently Played" playlist.   You configure it the way you want, I've set it to the 5 most recent items,  and then run this code...  precodetell application "iTunes"     set rp to get playlist "Recently Played"     #get name of every track of rp     #get name of last track of rp     #set tid to get id of last track of rp     reveal track 5 of rp      activate      tell application "System Events"         tell process "iTunes"             key code 34 using command down         end tell     end tell         end tell /code/pre  Hope this helped.  EDIT: This only works with songs that are fully played. Partially played tracks will not show up in the "Recently Played".  <comment188652> If, by Recently Played, you mean a smart playlist...  I deleted that long ago for exactly the reason you mentioned.  Partially played tracks don't show up there, which I find frustrating.  Hhhmmmm...  I may need to think about an alternate approach, such as logging all songs played?  Or something?  I love being able to automate things, but I want those solutions to always work.  I skip around in iTunes often enough that the recently played column isn't always helpful.  I wish I could create a smart playlist with everything played or skipped listed chronologically. <comment189107> Yes a smart playlist. Alternatively, like you said, you can write a script to constantly query the song played and log it somewhere and use that to go back. It would be easy enough to write. It is also possible to be notified of [events from itunes](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13654850) but you would have to write a cocoa app.
