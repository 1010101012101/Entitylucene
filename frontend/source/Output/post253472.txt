Force apps to be opened everytime in a new desktop <body> Is it possible to force an app that is being opened to be actually opened every time in a different desktop, so that the current desktop is not polluted with layered or stacked windows?  <answer253575> It should remember your choice if you change it to fullscreen before quitting. Another option is to use the Single Application Mode:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock single-app -bool true killall Dock /code/pre  Which may not be exactly what you want. I just tried on macOS Sierra and it's a little clunky- but still works.  <answer267015> You can set any app to launch in a specific Space.br It will open in the same one every time after that.  To get it there the first time  ul liSwitch to that Space then launch it,  /li /ul  or if it's already running    ul liRight click it in the Dock  Options.br Set to 'All Desktops'.br Switch to your preferred Space - it will move with you.  /li /ul  Right click it in the Dock  Options. Set the Option to 'This Desktop'.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B3art.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This method, of course, is not an automatic process &amp; requires setting up by hand. One advantage is that you quickly learn which Space belongs to which app &amp; can then use shortcut keys - kbd Ctrl âŒƒ /kbd kbd [number] /kbd by default.  Setting System Prefs  Mission Control to disable 'Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use' will make the assigned Space numbers stick.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOiBL.png" alt="enter image description here"  This method will only work correctly if you don't manually move any app window to a different Space. Spaces cannot correctly handle apps split over more than one Space.
