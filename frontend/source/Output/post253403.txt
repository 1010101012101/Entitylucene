Can I import pictures into Aperture using wifi? <body> I recently purchased an otterbox power case for my iphone 5.  For reasons that only the hardware gremlins know, it will charge, sync, but aperture will NOT recognize the phone. (Otterbox's site warns of this.)  So to get my pix off the phone I have to remove the case, which is a moderate PITA  I have enabled wifi sync.  That works, but does not include aperture.  Local connectivity to the world is erratic.  I would prefer an non-cloud based solution.
