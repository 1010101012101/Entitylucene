Do root actions as non root in Mavericks? <body> Why does this work as (not) expected?  precodetouch filename chown root filename sudo chmod 700 filename rm filename /code/pre  I get asked if I want to delete the file an then!?!? The file gets emreally/em deleted! How on earth? Everybody that sits in front of my pc could easily mess up my system. I know it will rarely happen but, this is a nightmare.  precoderm -rf / /code/pre  <answer118967> Permissions to remove a file from a directory are not related to the file, but to the directory the file is in.  Your group, or everyone, has write permissions on the directory where you are able to delete the file.  In the example below, there is a file which only root can read/write; but, user "administrator" owns the directory, and has rwx permissions.  Another user ("my_user") is unable to remove the file, but "administrator" can.  precodesh-3.2# ls -lFa total 0 drwxr-xr-x   3 administrator  wheel  102 Jan 28 11:12 ./ drwxrwxrwt  18 root           wheel  612 Jan 28 11:12 ../ -rw-------   1 root           wheel    0 Jan 28 11:12 a.txt sh-3.2# su my_user bash-3.2$ rm a.txt override rw-------  root/wheel for a.txt? y rm: a.txt: Permission denied bash-3.2$ exit exit sh-3.2# su administrator bash-3.2$ rm a.txt override rw-------  root/wheel for a.txt? y bash-3.2$  /code/pre  <comment138738> You had permission to create a file in whatever directory you touched filename, so unless you remove the group write permissions on the file, it probably won't matter who owns the file. Perhaps I'm not realizing what your pre-conditions are, but neither of the commands seem designed to break the security of OS X or any other UNIX for that matter. <comment138741> Something tells me you haven't done the research of actually trying to run `rm -rf /` on an OS X system while not logged in as root...
