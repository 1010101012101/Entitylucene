Boot mac with os select option everytime <body> By holding down option key while booting I can select which OS I want to boot into. This is a bit hit and miss for me, sometimes the option key is not recognised and it just boots into my default OS.  Is there a way to boot into the OS select option everytime without pressing the option key ?  Thanks  <answer11762> You could install Refit, which does the job for you.  <comment12307> Cool, ill give that a try.
