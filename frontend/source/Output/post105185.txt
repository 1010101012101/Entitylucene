How can I stop my retina display from taking 2x sized screenshots? <body> I recently got a retina display MacBook, and all my screenshots (via kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd3/kbd or kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd4/kbd) end up being twice the size compared to how they appear on-screen.   How can I stop this from happening?  <answer105461> When you say your screenshots "end up" twice the size, I suspect you're sending them to people who are viewing them on non-retina displays. If so, that's to be expected – the pixel density on your display is higher, so when they view a screenshot taken from your machine on theirs, it'll appear physically larger.  One workaround for this, if you're sending the screenshots via OS X Mail, is to set the Image Size setting for attached images to "Large" instead of "Actual Size." That'll scale down the attached image such that it'll appear "normal" when viewed on a non-retina display.  <answer119286> Your best bet is to use a third party utility like RetinaCapture.  This is quite cumbersome to use, but gives you what you're looking for, and provides the option for generating both 1x and 2x screen captures at the same time, which is helpful if you're building a website:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/etz3u.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z0NOM.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  I expect that there is a setting somewhere to do this (codecom.apple.screencapture/code seems the best candidate); but I can't find it.  <answer129428> This is how I handle it. It's convoluted, but it works, and doesn't interrupt my screen-grab - paste workflow wildly... I just screengrab, call an alfred workflow, and then paste.  codeCMD-CTRL-SHIFT-4/code will capture a section of the screen. That section is copied to the OSX clipboard. Then I launch a script in terminal to save the clipboard contents to a temporary file, resize by half (72 dpi is half of 144 dpi), and copy the image back to the clipboard. This requires the use of several utilities - if someone knows of a way to accomplish this same feat with one simple utility please let me know.  I launch this script from Alfred to make it easy to get to:  precode#!/bin/bash pngpaste /tmp/ss.png width=$((`sips -g pixelWidth /tmp/ss.png | cut -s -d ':' -f 2 | cut -c 2-` / 2)) sips -Z $width /tmp/ss.png impbcopy /tmp/ss.png /code/pre  codepngpaste/code is on github: https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste. codesips/code comes with OSX. codeimpbcopy/codeis here: http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=3816  LifeHacker had an article on sips http://lifehacker.com/5962420/batch-resize-images-quickly-in-the-os-x-terminal that I referenced, as well as this gist: gist.github.com/lanceli/4966207.  For Alfred, I just made a workflow that runs this as a bash script:  precode/Users/yourusername/bin/shrink_clipboard &gt; /dev/null 2&amp;&gt;1 /code/pre  <answer147734> use the following addon for firefox  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/screengrab-fix-version/  <answer174999> Two workarounds:  ol liIf you have a non-Retina external monitor, drag the application window there and take the screenshot.

Simply export as an application and then drag-and-drop anything into it to get a "non-retina" version of it at 72ppi and half the pixel resolution.  The bash code is:  precodefor f in "$@" do     width=$((`sips -g pixelWidth "$f" | cut -s -d ':' -f 2 | cut -c 2-` / 2))     sips -s dpiHeight 72.0 -s dpiWidth 72.0 -Z $width "$f" done /code/pre  <answer272776> h3Right Click Automator Workflow Service/h3  There are some great answers here, but I wanted something a little more optional and a little less automatic.  I created a new Service in Automator called strongCreate Non-Retina Version/strong which can be called from right clicking on any image file in Finder.  Here's how it's used:   strong1. Find retina image./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IxdkQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  strong2.

Like literally 4x the pixel density? Screen shots usually capture a 1:1 pixel density image. Can you check the image properties in Preview to make sure it's really 2x the width and 2x the height of your retina display which is either 2880×1800 (15") or 2560×1600 (13"). <comment174169> Please add some information what it does etc. <comment206196> There are lots of cases where your retina screenshot will look twice as big, even on your own Retina display. Uploading to any website that ignores the DPI setting, for starters. <comment250372> A screencap of a retina display has the same number of pixels originally displayed. When shared in many other contexts (eg, pasted on the web), the higher DPI information is lost, so it appears twice as big. 2880x1800 is a pretty freaking big image. <comment271566> Are you opening them in Preview.app? When viewing any image on a Retina display, Preview uses four screen pixels to display one image pixel. The benefit is most images appear at a traditional physical size, but screenshots of the display itself appear quadrupled. Other image editors, like [Acorn](http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/) and [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), use one screen pixel per image pixel, so your screenshots will appear at a normal size. <comment271567> @SteveBennett The PNGs created by taking screenshots don't have DPI information. <comment271610> Huh, that's disappointing. <comment273844> clever workarounds! <comment273845> No, 72 dpi is **standard on the internet**.  See the clear example I put in to the question (it's amazing you've never noticed this.)  The fact that Apple makes the decision to save it at 144 dpi, is just a poor decision by them, for now.  (Sure, maybe in 20 years "everyone" will abstract out the DPI concept, as Apple now do.  For now it's just totally useless and silly.) <comment273847> "The PNGs created by taking screenshots don't have DPI information" To see the DPI information you need only open in Preview (ie, "double click") and look at the info panel which gives the DPI information. <comment273848> It's a great pity AffinityPhoto does not include a Droplet system :) <comment280339> I love this, in theory, but for me it either garbles the image or makes it blurry beyond recognition... <comment311802> @Ze'ev Try replacing lines 2 and 3 with this: `/usr/bin/sips -s dpiHeight 72.0 -s dpiWidth 72.0 /tmp/ss.png` <comment311813> @tubedogg OMG, thanks, that works great! <comment311817> Aha ... the issue is actually [a "bug" in Google Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=355477&can=2&start=0&num=100&q=&colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Component%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified) which resamples images incorrectly. If I paste the same clipboard into Mail.app, it looks just right. So this workaround effectively scales up the image for "sharp" pasting in Chrome, and you can then resize it with the Gmail resize corner... until they fix this... <comment311842> @Ze'ev it's not just Chrome. Any app which discards the DPI information will display the image incorrectly. In this case, it's a combination of things - the (other) bug in Chrome causes the image to be resized on top of dropping the DPI info, which makes it look even worse. <comment325386> Had never noticed this. To me it happens only with screenshots taken via `CMD+SHIFT+3` (entire screen) but not those taken via `CMD+SHIFT+4` (selected area of screen). <comment364655> I found that the following provided the lowest file size without affecting quality:  `screencapture -ioW $SCREENSHOT && pngquant -f --ext .png --skip-if-larger $SCREENSHOT && impbcopy $SCREENSHOT` <comment372563> Nice, I put it in Evernote Helper (in the menubar) and works.
