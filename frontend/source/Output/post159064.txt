Use Mail.app in English? <body> I'm trying to use Mail.app in English in Yosemite. The reason for this is that when the app is in another language, it uses that language's headers for replies and can be very distracting to the other reader.   So the two possible solutions are a reply-header fix (like Outlook's "Use English for message headers on replies and forwards and forward notifications" option) or a Mail.app language fix. There supposedly is a way to fix a single-app's language, but they don't work.   Here is what I've tried:   codedefaults write -app Mail AppleLanguages -array en/code  codedefaults write -app Mail AppleLanguages -array en-US/code  Editing the file: code/Users/[username]/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist/code  and adding an "AppleLanguages" strongarray/strong and then as the first strongString/strong value, adding "strongen/strong", which is what the defaults command does.   <answer159069> To modify Mail to use another language than the default system language open Terminal and enterbr codedefaults write com.apple.mail AppleLanguages ‘(“preferred_language”, “default_language”)’/code.br In your example: codedefaults write com.apple.mail AppleLanguages ‘(“en”, “fi”)’/code (assuming your default language is finnish)  <comment186948> did you try `defaults write com.apple.mail AppleLanguages ‘(“en”, “your_original_language”)’`? <comment186952> This worked! Thanks for that! <comment186953> AppleLangauges (instead of AppleLanguages) in your question is just a spelling error there? or also in your plist file? <comment186954> Good eye - so that solution works, as well. It was a spelling error.Thanks a million!
