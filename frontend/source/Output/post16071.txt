Recommended carrying bag for macbook pro 15.4" <body> What are some recommended carrying cases for MBP 15.4"   <answer16077> BrentHaven makes amazing cases.  I used a backpack of theirs for four years of school for my MacBook Pro (the first Intel one they released), and it performed admirably.  Superb protection.  <comment17541> Buying recommendations are off-topic as per the FAQ (see the site's title bar). <comment17596> Thanks a lot . Really loved their Brenthaven ProStyle Slim Pack. Will order that one and try it out.
