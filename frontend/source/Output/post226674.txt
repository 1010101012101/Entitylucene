List core audio devices <body> Using some old audio software that has buggy dialogs and I can't seem to be able to properly select my sound card. It just would stop responding when I click it.  I found the software has a configuration file and would accept a value like this:  codecoreaudio://60 (Soundflower (64ch))/code  It seems like the device id and some string value with the name of the device.  I would like to be able to list all available core audio devices on my MBP, so I can configure the application using this configuration file.  Would you help me, please? Some command line application or a media player that displays the core audio ids would do just fine.  <comment275270> Try running `grep key /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist | grep :` <comment275350> Just ran it, but it does not seem to show the id that I need. Example output: `keySoundflowerEngine:1/key`. You can see the value is not `60` as in my example.
