File named zero <body> I've got a lot of files named code0/code all over the place on my filesystem. They contain some digits (mostly also zeroes) inside.  I'am wondering what they are and where they came from? I'm running OS X Lion Developer Preview 3, but I'm not sure if that's the case.  <answer14509> You might try running the command  precodesudo dtrace -qn 'syscall::open:entry /arg1&amp;O_CREAT/ {printf("%5d %s file:%s\n",pid,execname,copyinstr(arg0));}' | grep '[:/]0$' /code/pre  in a terminal window. The codedtrace/code output will list the process ID, process name, and filename argument for any codeopen()/code call with the codeO_CREAT/code flag set, meaning it will create the file if it does not already exist. Drop the final grep bit if you want to see all potentially file creating codeopen()/code calls, but then the output might possibly overwhelm you. Hit ctrl-C when you're done with it.  If something keeps creating files named code0/code, the culprit ought to show up in the output.  (Edit: Fixed the grep invocation.)  <comment15623> Many terminal scripts and unix commands use `0` as the exit status to indicate that they ran successfully. Is it possible that you've somehow ended up redirecting the output from shell scripts or unix commands to empty files? I know I end up with misdirected output occasionally. Are they ending up in your home folder?
