Complete words by pressing space like Android? <body> I would like to know if it's possible to complete the word by pressing space like it happens on Android devices.  This is because if you need to tap the word on the bar on top of the keyboard it's much slower compared to tapping space.   <comment368033> The space bar has exactly this function in iOS word completion. Is it not working for you? I suggest you go to Settings  General  Keyboards and see what the settings look like.
