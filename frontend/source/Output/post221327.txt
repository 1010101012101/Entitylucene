How can I hook up a PHP server? <body> I have a php page I want to test on a server. Is there a server that runs through Terminal.app that supports PHP? I read this tutorial, but either I did it wrong or it didn't work. How can I start up a server?  <answer221336> The simplest way to set this up is to use MAMP. You can download it for free from here: https://www.mamp.info  It sets up a local and isolated PHP/MySQL/Apache server that you can start and stop at any time.  It's a web developers friend if you want to keep your Mac system somewhat isolated from the development work.
