How to see everything in the NVRAM <body> I know you can show the contents of the NVRAM with codesudo nvram -x -p/code, but doing that doesn't seem to list everything. I say this because I just had an issue with the resolution of my screen at boot, resetting the NVRAM fixed it. However, I compared the output of that command before and after clearing the NVRAM, and it is identical. Are there more variables in there that can't be seen with the traditional codesudo nvram -x -p/code? If so, can they be seen with another method?  <answer263336> In a Terminal type codeman nvram/code and press: kbdenter/kbd  You'll see that the code-p/code emoption/em states:     Print all of the firmware variables.   Therefore whatever it prints, is what's stored in codeNVRAM/code.  There should not be any hidden emvariables/em, however the output for some emvariables/em may not be in what's generally considered as emhuman readable format/em.   <comment329899> What you see is what you get.
