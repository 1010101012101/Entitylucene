Change color in default options when printing on yosemite <body> We've got the following printer setup:  precodeDriver:     Brother MFC-L9550CDW-AirPrint (color, 2-sided printing) Connection: dnssd://PRINTER._ipp._tcp.local./?uuid=e3248000-80ce-11db-8000-30055c4b125b Defaults:   job-sheets=none, none media=iso_a4_210x297mm sides=one-sided /code/pre  This information comes straight from CUPS. In there I tried to "Set Default Options" for that printer. What does work out but, I changed the "Color Mode" to "Grayscale". Unfortunately the default preset remains like it was (the Black &amp; White checkbox doesn't get checked).  What am I doing wrong? How can I change the default printer preset or default printer settings to be Black &amp; White?  So yea... strongthis/strong doesn't work.  <comment222545> Greyscale is not the same as black & white, btw <comment222574> @Tetsujin I know but why doesn't it show Black & White than?
