changing Chrome desktop app Cmd-Tab behaviour <body> I use the Google Hangouts desktop app. But when i use kbdCommand/kbd kbdTab/kbd, it comes under Chrome rather than being a separate application. If I have emHangouts/em and emChrome/em open, I have to use kbdCommand/kbd kbd`/kbd (backtick) to switch between them.   Is there anyway I can move the emHangouts/em app to a separate kbdCommand/kbd kbdTab/kbd group?
