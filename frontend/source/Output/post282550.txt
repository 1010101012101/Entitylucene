Data Not Backed Up, Partition Type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF <body> I was trying to install Linux on my MacBook for class when I bricked my computer, which now in an unbootable state.   I made my partition too small, so I was going to delete and create a larger one. However, Disk Utility did not allow me to delete the small partition. I followed the instructions from https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/238088/236252  However, not only was I still unable to delete it, but upon restarting I realized my primary partition (located on the same disk) changed into FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF, and I had no options to boot.  (I am sure I performed the command on the correct disk and partition)  I saw some similar threads, but my main bootable drive is the one that got corrupt.   I don't want to lose any data. I'm not the most terminal savvy, so ANY help is appreciated, and I will kindly provide any additional information!  (Disk 0, partition 2 is my main partition, and that only one I care about)  Below are the results of  strong$ diskutil list/strong and strong$ gpt -r show disk0/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k9xgV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ivnap.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongUPDATE:/strong :  I have followed @klanomath 's instructions.

To any future reader with this problem: PLEASE don't give up, it can be fixed!   <answer282552> To add an answer strongexactly/strong fitting to your case I slightly modified my answer in the linked "duplicate" and posted it here again.  hr  The second as well as the third partition of your internal disk got the wrong partition type, your data probably won't be lost.  A bootable OS X partition (except the Recovery HD) either has the GUID 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC for a standard OS X partition or the GUID 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC for a CoreStorage partition. The FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF is an unknown partition type (but not strongno partition/strong like the 000000-0000-0000.... one).  The first block of a standard OS X partition doesn't contain non-zeros, the first block of a CoreStorage partition contains some non-zeros. To get the first 3 blocks of a partition you have to use a substitute for hexdump/xxd (both aren't available in Recovery Mode/OS X Installer boot drive). The best I have found is codedd if=/dev/diskXsY count=3 | vis -c/code.  The GUID partition table can be modified with codegpt/code. emgpt/em only writes to the first 34 and the last 33 blocks of a disk(512) or the first 6 and and last 5 blocks of a 4k disk. Modifying the partition table (even falsely) doesn't alter the content of any volume on your disk, strongif/strong you don't initialize or repair a volume/disk by request. You may verify it though.  hr  ul liBoot to Internet Recovery Mode or an OS X Installer boot drive/li liOpen Terminal in the menubar Utilities  Terminal/li liGet an overview with codediskutil list/code/li liGet an overview of your internal disk with the disk identifier found in the previous command.

The main volume is encrypted. The Recovery HD contains a special intermediate FileVault key then. If the key is missing the main system won't boot. It was possible to unlock the drive though with codediskutil cs unlockVolume .../code.  After installing a full macOS to a thumb drive and booting to it, the EFI partition and the Recovery HD of another non-FileVault drive (actually those of a Sierra VM) were dd'ed to the broken drive. Still booted from the thumb drive, the FileVault volume was reverted to a standard volume by right-clicking on the volume in the Finder, choosing "Decrypt volume" and entering a valid user password. This has to be the password of an eligible user account on the FileVault volume. Other methods to decrypt the volume like codediskutil cs revert lvUUID/code or codediskutil cs decryptVolume lvUUID/code - tested in a virtual machine only - didn't seem to work. This might be a restriction of VMs though.  To expand the main partition (disk0s2) to the full size, use Disk Utility or the codediskutil resizeVolume .../code command.  The volume initially didn't appear in System Preferences  Startup Disk, but kbdalt/kbd-booting the Mac unveiled the main volume. This probably re-blessed the volume's boot.efi properly. The (now standard) volume appears in Startup Disk again.   <comment355999> Yes, I would like to delete the deleteme partition. I looked at that post, but I was concerned that "gpt remove" would erase my disk contents? <comment356002> Thank you for taking the time to help. I just wanted to be crystal clear on this: in your post above, for your 7th bullet, when you say "now remove the third, the fourth and the second partition" with "gpt remove", won't that erase my data on the second partition (which is the one I care about)? <comment356004> Sorry I missed that! I'm a little frenzy right now <comment356011> I received an error at the last step while trying to verify disk0. 'Error: -69766: The partition map needs to be repaired because there's a problem with the EFI system partition's file system. Underlying error: 8: POSIX reports: Exe format error' <comment356013> @HalfwayThere This is an ugly error but your MacBook may still  be restored to a bootable state. Just try to boot it. The EFI error is probably a result of the Linux install and has to be solved with other tools/in a 2nd step... <comment356014> Should I perform the verifyVolume command before I attempt to reboot it? <comment356370> +1 This is a great answer! Not only does it solve the issue, but also educates users along the way. You've really gone out of your way to help the OP and I hope you get a lot more up votes for this! :) <comment356700> Yes! I've backed up everything with Time Machine now. Never again <comment356702> ;-) ............ <comment372346> @klanomath had exactly the same problem did exactly what you told.But now when i m trying to verify my disk its showing error 69846 unrecognized file system.What to do now? <comment372463> @BiswadeepKBanik You misinterpreted some diskutil/gpt output probably and set the wrong partition boundaries. Without further details I can't solve your problem. Please ask another question or invite me to a TeamViewer session...
