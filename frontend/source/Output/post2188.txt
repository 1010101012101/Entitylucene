Is it possible to download a podcast directly to an iPod Touch without jailbreaking? <body> Specifically with the iPod Touch that was released in September 2010, is it possible to download a podcast directly to the unit. The answers that I've found so far involve jailbreaking, which I'm not interested in doing.  I would like to avoid having to use my main computer at all for managing podcasts, if possible.  <answer2189> On the iPhone which is more or less the same thing; in the iTunes application there is a podcast section under "More"  <answer2190> You could always use a third party app like PodCaster.  <comment1846> Does that mean that I can download a podcast directly to the iPod, or do I have to sync it from iTunes on my computer? <comment1847> @Kyle Cronin: Aren't all iPod Touch models wifi-only? <comment1848> @jdl Yes, sorry. u07ch mentioned his iPhone and I forgot the question was about iPod Touches. <comment1849> Went to my local apple store on saturday; the iTunes application on them had the podcast section so if your podcast is in itunes you can download it without a computer. <comment1850> +1 for the idea. For whatever reason, the 3rd party apps that I found all required jail breaking. This particular app, however, has some bad reviews that are concerning. Anyone know of more solid and polished apps that perform this function? <comment1851> Yeah, that app is kinda marginal at best. <comment96656> This depends a lot on what version of iOS you are running. Please specify software versions!
