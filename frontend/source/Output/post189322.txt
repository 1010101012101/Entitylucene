Charts from numbers not dynamically updating in Pages/Keynote <body> I have the latest (5/2015) Pages, Numbers, and Keynote on Yosemite.  I created a chart in numbers and then copied it to Pages or Keynote. I then want to be able to change the data in Numbers and see the chart updated in Pages or Keyonte. However, I don't see an option to "refresh".  Is there a way to dynamically link Numbers to Pages or Keynote?  <answer189329> Not yet.
