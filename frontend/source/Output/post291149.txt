Permanently change mount point of volume? <body> I'd like to set another user's home folder to use a certain volume on my disk. To that end, I'd like to be able to mount said volume at a specific location, say, at codeUsers/foobar/code  I can do this using the command line by running codesudo mount -t hfs /dev/disk0s4 /Users//code, however this is only a temporary solution. If I unmount and remount the disk, it will mount to its usual location in codeVolumes//code  Is there some way to permanently specify the mount point of a disk?  <answer291154> Set an entry in code/etc/fstab/code as directed here. To summarize.  ol liOpen Disk Utility, unmount the relevant volume./li liClick on the volume you're trying to mount, and click the "info" button. Note down the drive's File System UUID, which should look something like code5E85BA88-7C74-34A9-8CE6-267C752CE2BA/code. I'm just gonna use code123abc/code as shorthand for it./li lisOpen up code/etc/fstab/code using your text editor of choice (run it as root!)/s Edit: as per klanomath's comment below, run codesudo vifs/code to safely edit codeetc/fstab/code, and add the following line.  codeUUID=123abc /desired/mount/path hfs rw 0 2/code/li liMount the volume, the mount point should show the path you specified./li /ol  Some notes:   ul lisI have absolutely no clue what the "1 2" does at the end of that line. It was there in the link, so I kept it./s Thanks to fd0 for helping me out here!/li liThe page I linked instructs you to reload code/etc/fstab/code using some codeniload/code command. I couldn't figure out how to install whatever package that required, but the good news is that I think DiskUtility will automatically reload the file, so don't worry about that./li liSome sources will tell you to reload codeetc/fstab/code using the command codemount -a/code. It seems like this should be a perfectly sensible way to do so, but it does not work. Don't worry if it tells you it can't mount a volume./li /ul  <comment367583> Set an entry in: `/etc/fstab` <comment367585> @user3439894 I already tried, as per the instructions [here](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050805062520199). However when I use the File System UUID which DiskUtility gives, an error occurs when opening the disk with `sudo mount -a`, namely `GetMasterBlock: Error 2 opening UUID=5E75BA88-7C74-34A9-8CE6-266C752CE2CA GetMasterBlock: Error 2 opening UUID=5E75BA88-7C74-34A9-8CE6-266C752CE2CA mount_hfs: error on mount(): error = -1. mount_hfs: No such file or directory` <comment367586> Never mind, it turns out that `mount -a` just doesn't function as expected, and that setting the entry in `/etc/fstab` works fine if you mount the disk using DiskUtility <comment367591> I suggest that you read the `man 5 fstab` manual. The fifth field in the `fstab` entry is the instruction on whether you allow the filesystem to be dumped (crippled in macOS, 0 would be a better choice). The sixth field is used to determine the order in which `fsck` is run. <comment367592> Editing of fstab is preferably done with `sudo vifs`! <comment367642> Thank you very much for the advice, I'll edit my answer to include it tomorrow
