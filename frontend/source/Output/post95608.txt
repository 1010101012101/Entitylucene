That will also eliminate the complicated answers. So nothing personal but it helps us managing this site. Thank you..PS I have to vote it down till you remove the multiple questions. <comment112166> Updated with only the initial question ;) <comment112169> Nice,... now lets see if someone will take the time with the answer. and you got +10 for doing it :)
