OSX Yosemite with R9 280X - wake from sleep windows moved to main monitor <body> I've got 10.10.5 on a mid-2010 Mac Pro with a PowerColor R9 280X (shows up as Radeon 7xxx class) I just picked up on ebay to replace my original 5870. The monitors are two LG 27UD88-W 4k on the MiniDisplayPort and a Benq 2560x1440 on the DVI, all running at 2560x1440.  Things are good except that after the displays go to sleep and wake up, ALL of my app windows have moved to the main monitor, the two side monitors are empty. This does not happen on restarts, but after restart the windows are not exactly positioned how I left them--they're slightly askew/lower.  Is there anything I can do to get these to behave? Is it the generic support of the card causing this?   <comment309336> I believe it's the video card's fault. When you go to sleep, your video card probably tells OS X that the displays are disconnected. If you can't stand it you could use an application such as KeepingYouAwake to make sure your computer doesn't sleep. It's not an optimal solution, but a fix nonetheless. <comment309433> Thanks. But I've got my Energy Saver prefs set to never sleep the computer. I only sleep the displays after an hour. I'm already looking for a window manager that can remember a set of positions for all my apps that I can trigger--Optimal Layout/SizeUp don't seem to have a "save this state for recall" ability, just a quick way to position. I already bought SizeUp so I don't need anything for ad hoc kb-shortcut based positioning.
