How can I synchronize my two Mac Computers? <body> I have a Macbook and an iMac, generally I work on my Macbook, but sometimes I need that information on my iMac. My OS is Mac OSX Snow Leopard.  <answer52262> If you are just looking to sync your files and document, give dropbox a try.  <answer52274> Depending on your usage scenarios (which you don't specify), I use the built-in rsync command to perform a one-way sync of files from one machine to another connected to the same network.   Alternatively, if you want full two-way synchronization (that is, sync changes made on either computer) then Unison (free/donationware) also works well.  <answer52283> I use ChronoSync for documents and DropBox for essentials. Dropbox has my notes, 1Password, etc and is used to share between all devices. For documents and other work, I have ChronoSync pointing at my documents folder and code folders to sync between my laptop and desktop. In my case, whenever I switch between the two computers, I just run the sync on the laptop while on the LAN with the desktop before continuing. All changes on each machine are synched to the latest version on both.  <answer52287> I use a similar setup (imac &amp; macbook air)  my experienced recommendation is to use  ul limobile me or icloud to sync email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, etcâ€¦ (google could be a substitute)/li lidropbox for files, documents, pictures &amp; some application preferences (textexpander)/li linotational velocity with simplenote sync for notes/li li*if something was still missing  can access the imac from parallels desktop via the iphone app (or any other remote desktop application)/li /ul  <comment59794> There are a lot of different sharing options. To make a recommendation more information concerning frequency, content, working mode, technical connectivity (WiFi, LAN, Internet) etc. would help. <comment59797> I second this, however the free 2gb may not be enough for many people. Another alternative available soon will be Cubby https://www.cubby.com/ which has device to device synchronisation as well as cloud space. Worth keeping an eye out for.
