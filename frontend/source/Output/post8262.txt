Last import in Address Book <body> A little history: I had a old Nokia 5310. Lost it. I had the contacts backed up in a .vcf file. So imported them to a old Sony Ericsson W700i. Used the W700i for sometime, added some more contacts.br Not got a new Nokia C5. Wanted to import all the contacts to the Nokia and at the same time add them to codeAddress Book/code so that I can manage all contacts from codeAddress Book/code and sync with the new Nokia. (codeAddress Book/code has some old contacts, that are not required to be on the phone but nevertheless necessary, my wife's contacts imported sometime before etc). (Thanks for reading)  I exported the contacts from the phone to a .vcf file and imported it in Address Book. Wanted to move only these contacts to the Nokia. So thought will open codeLast Import/code and sync all of them with the new phone.br But looks like codeLast Import/code holds all of my imports, not just the most recent one.  I tried to select a group and then import, but the import does not happen to the group. They are imported to the "All Contacts".  Is there any way to get/select only the most recent imported contacts?  <answer8265> Are you comfortable with AppleScript? If so, you could write a script to export the contacts created after a date of your choosing.  <answer20705> A smart group with a rule of "card was updated after (date)" would get you close to the correct list.  Also, in Lion, Last Import resets the list correctly for each import performed.  <comment8903> G. I am not very comfortable with AppleScript but have no problems learning. But will getting _contacts created after a date of your choosing_ be sufficient? It is possible that one of the contacts I imported last was already there and I had _merged_ it. <comment8904> @Nivas you can also use the date it was last modified. <comment44918> Is the date updated still available for smart groups? I hope it is still available to Applescripts. It seems missing from the app's interface. <comment44934> "Card was updated after (date)" smart group rules are still available in Lion.
