Apple Music tracks that are added on iTunes aren't showing up on iOS devices <body> Currently I'm using the free trial period of Apple Music.  On iTunes, I'm adding the songs that I like to my music. Just adding not downloading.  When I'm checking my iPhone and iPad, those added songs aren't getting added to codeMy Music/code section.  However on iPhone and iPad, I disabled automatic download for music. I don't want music to be downloaded (crappy 16GB iPhone).   I only want the songs that I added on iTunes to appear in music player on iPhone and iPad.  <answer232639> On your iOS devices, make sure iCloud Music Library is enabled in the Music section of the Settings app.
