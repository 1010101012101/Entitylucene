Can a Macbook 4,1 use 64bit architecture? <body> I have a Macbook 4,1 running Mac OS X 10.7, and I need to install the MESA program, that only works on 64bit machines. Running codeuname/code tells me that my mac is working in 32bit mode, and a quick search online told me that it should be able to run as 64bit, which is what I need.  precode$: uname -m i386 /code/pre  Following Apple's advice, I tried to get my computer to boot up again in 64bit mode, and verified it with codeuname/code again, to discover I'd failed. So, my question is, strongcan my macbook work in 64bit mode?/strong  <answer214437> If you simply have software that needs to run as 64bit then yes it is compatible, if you have software that needs a 64bit kernel (rare) then no it is not compatible. From looking at the website where it shows system requirements it shows it needs a 64bit capable CPU, which is what your MacBook has, same CPU as my iMac. As you can see below on my Late 2006 iMac with 2GHz Core 2 Duo running 10.7.5 with a 32bit kernel and all 64bit processes. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kWBlG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment258902> I think the general rule of thumb is that if it can't run OS X 10.8 it can't do 64-bit kernel - https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT3770 <comment258906> From [another page](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201948), I get that I have a 64bit processor, but not a 64bit kernel. According to [this answer on Superuser](http://superuser.com/a/340644), the issue may be 32bit drivers preventing me from using a 64bit kernel. <comment258914> As a general rule if you can not run OS X 10.6 with a 64bit kernel then you are out of luck. The MacBook EFI prevents running the 64 bit kernel. If I'm not mistaken the last OS X upgrade for a MacBook is 10.7  with running a 32 bit kernel.
