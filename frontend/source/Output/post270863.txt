How to boot GNU/Linux Live USB Drive on MAC Mini G4 <body> I can't find enough documentation on the Internet on how to boot an USB Drive on Mac Mini G4. I have already created a bootable USB Drive using Lubuntu 14.04 PowerPC ISO image but I can figure out how to boot it using OpenFirmware commands.   <comment340503> See if anything in [Booting your iBook G4 from a USB stick](http://ben-collins.blogspot.com/2010/08/booting-your-ibook-g4-from-usb-stick.html) can help.
