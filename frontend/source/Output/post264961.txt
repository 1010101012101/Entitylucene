Can I enable java plugin for Safari specific site in macOS Sierra? <body> I understand that Java is almost completely disabled in Safari under macOS Sierra. I need to connect to a VPN (Junos Pulse) which only have a web-based interface to authenticate which then loads a Java applet to do the OS integration. Is there a way to force allow Java for this specific domain "under the hood" ?
