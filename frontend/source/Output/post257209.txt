FAT (file allocation table) variant used when disk is formatted using OS X (macOS) disk utility <body> Disk Utility on OS X (macOS) shows "MS-DOS (FAT) " as one of the format options  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GGqQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  FAT (File Allocation Table) has many variants like FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32  My questions are mentioned below:  ol liWhich FAT variant is taken when I formate disk using "MS-DOS (FAT) format?/li liWhat is maximum size (for partition/disk) of FAT variant selected in question 1?/li /ol  <answer257218> Apple MSDOS-FAT is FAT32; max partition size = 2T; max file size is 4GB  FAT12 and FAT16 are (as far as I remember) pre-Win95.  <answer257219> In Disk Utility, when choosing MS-DOS (FAT), the FAT version will be size appropriate. In other words, if creating a disk image of 1.4 MB it will be formatted FAT12, if 100 MB it will be FAT16 and in the case of your 8 GB Flash Drive it will be FAT32. The FAT (File Allocation Table) link in your question answers #2 however there is nothing to worry about as it's considerable larger then your Flash Drive.  The issue to be aware of is on a FAT32 volume the maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB minus 1 byte or 4,294,967,295 (2sup32/sup âˆ’ 1) bytes.  <comment321688> For screenshot, I used 8GB flash drive. In reality, I want to format 1TB Western Digital external hard-disk.  Based on your explanation and my limited knowledge, 1TB can be formatted with MS-DOS (FAT) option. It will be FAT32, which is compatible with OS X/macOS, Linux and Windows 7 & above. Correct? <comment321694> @I-M-JM, Yes it will be FAT32 as a 1 TB partition/volume cannot be formatted FAT16 or FAT12 because of its size.  This is why I said "_... the FAT version will be size appropriate ..._".
