OS X 10.10.4 update on 2009 Mac Pro: stuck at "Missing bluetooth controller transport" on boot <body> I have an early-2009 Mac Pro at work that had 10.10.3 on it. I attempted to update it (using the cached update on the local OS X update server) to 10.10.4 but, after boot, it got stuck on the grey screen with the progress bar at 50%.  Rebooting in verbose mode shows "Missing bluetooth controller transport".  Internet searches suggest that this is GPU related and also Hackintosh related. The latter is not in my case because this is a genuine Mac Pro.  I tried anyway booting into single-user-mode and following the suggestions of moving the Apple Intel HD graphics drivers out of place and codetouch/codeing the Extensions folder. This did not solve the issue.  This computer has two Nvidia GeForce GT 120 cards in it, though only one is actively used.  So: stronghow do I fix it short of reinstalling the OS?/strong  <answer229466> I'd certainly try it with only one of the GPUs in there, try swapping over if no joy.  I'd also be tempted to run the "standard toolkit" assuming you can get into the OS fully, though the first can be done from the Recovery partition…  ul liReset the SMCbr Shut down the computer.

They didn't help, unfortunately. I ended up removing the HDD, putting it in another computer, and manually running the combo-update on it again. That magical incantation made it work.
