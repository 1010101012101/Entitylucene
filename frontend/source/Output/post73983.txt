IPhone 5 power button not responsive <body> Recently the power button on my iPhone 5 has become hard to press, and slow to come back up after being pressed.   strongUpdate/strong : As I was typing this I was repeatedly pressing the power button. It eventually returned to its normal position. I am adding this question anyway because I want to know if anyone else has experienced this issue and if so did they had to take their phone into Apple for repair (or talked to a Apple rep that recommended they take it in). (i.e is it a symptom of a bigger problem)  strongUpdate/strong  : It appears to continue to stick at times. I'm going to bring it in next chance I get. Thanks. Note: It's fairly cold here some days (10'F) I'll have to check that next time it happens (probably not).   <answer74002> Honestly, this sounds like a hardware problem. It wouldn't be software causing that. Chances are it's simply a bad switch. Hopefully you have AppleCare. If so, wait until it gets bad then take it in. They probably would just replace it. Otherwise - purchase AppleCare if you're still within the time. ;-)   I suppose there is also the possibility something like that could come from something somehow getting in the switch, or damage from a drop. Likely not the case for you, but I think it could happen.  Again, in conclusion, it's probably a bad switch.  <answer95333> I agree with strongBassplayer/strong (great name BTW) in that it's a hardware issue. But just to expand on it, I've had the same issue with my iPhone 4S and because I bought it used, taking it to the Apple store isn't an option.   My solution until I get a new phone, is to use the strongemAssistiveTouch/em/strong to turn my phone off and put it to sleep (along with other functions like taking a screenshot).   If you haven't heard, the emAssistiveTouch/em is a white, translucent dot on the screen that when tapped opens a context menu that will give you options for Sleep mode, powering off, among others.   You can turn this on in:     strongSettings  General  Accessibility  AssistiveTouch On/strong   You can also toggle the display of the dot with:     strongSettings  General  Accessibility  Triple-click Home/strong set to strongAssistiveTouch/strong.    This way you can hide the white dot when it gets in the way.  <comment85983> I've had problems with the home button on earlier models of iPhone, but never the power button. <comment135627> Thanks! Btw the triple-click home is under General  Accessibility  Accessibility Shortcut - select "Assistive Touch"
