How to resolve: files which are visible in Terminal, but invisible in the Finder? <body> In Yosemite v10.10.3, I am trying to reinstall Skype, as it does not sign-in at all, following this link. In order to do so, I need to move some files and folders to trash as to totally uninstall Skype first. However, I cannot see these files and folders in the Finder, although they are visible in the Terminal !!  I've also tried the following two commands:  precode:...&amp; defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES :...&amp; killall Finder /code/pre  The result is that I see many hidden files among which I cannot find the files and folders I am looking for.  Please help me with any of them: Skype sign-in problem or Finder Invisibility !!  <answer194266> I don't know about your sign-in problem but about removing the files, you can remove all the required files from the Terminal itself. Removing the Skype app itself from the Applications folder shouldn't be a problem. Type these in Terminal to remove the other files (press enter after each line to execute the command):  precoderm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Skype/ rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.skype.skype.plist* /code/pre  <answer194267> Be sure you aren't looking in the root library, but your user library. Skype in Application Support and com.skype.plist are not invisible by default. Try changing the code~/Library/Application Support/code with code/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/ Application Support/code, with  being your Username without the &lt;.   I find it easy to "Go to" with kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdG/kbd while there is Finder selected, and in the path type code/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support//code and click Go. Then look for Skype. To find the plist, do the same, but with Preferences.  Also note that in terminal, the path to Application support would have a backslash (code/Application\ Support/code), instead of only a Space  <comment231647> Thanks for your reply. I used these commands eventually to remove the files you mentioned, well, without the `-f` or `-rf` options. I also typed `~/.Trash/` at the end of the command line to move it to trash first before completely deleting it (just as a security practice). Nonetheless, I am looking to resolve the issue of the visibility in the Finder in case it happened in the future. <comment231648> Thank you for your answer. You are correct. I was looking inside the "Root" directory and not inside "Users" directory. The shortcut is very helpful too (a non related question: how did you insert the keyboard keys in your answer?!). <comment231654> I used the kbd tags. Like so: `kbdCommand/kbd` <comment231684> The `-r` option is required for removing directories. By the way, typing `~/.Trash/` will cause the command to remove this too. It doesn't mean moving it to the Trash. <comment231687> And for the visibility of hidden files, I suppose you typed the command wrong, just type these and it will work:  `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES`  then this,   `killall Finder`  For undoing it, just replace YES with NO.
