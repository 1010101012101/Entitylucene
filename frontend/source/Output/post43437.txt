Prevent image resizing in Pages <body> If I paste in an image into Pages '09, it scales the image, creating something that is either too small, or too large. Trying to resize these is driving me crazy, how can I either prevent this from happening, or quickly get it back to its original size?  <answer43445> In the "Inspector" on the "metrics" tab click "Original Size".   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X0hOV.png" alt="enter image description here"  And for inserting images I prefer from the menu "Insert" and then "Choose..." or kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdV/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gewze.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment49331> Have you tried grabbing a corner of the image and resizing? It's quite easy to do. <comment49362> Wonderful, thanks! <comment141230> I'm having the same problem, but the 'Original size' button just restores it to the 2x-size I get when I drag and drop the image. Any ideas?
