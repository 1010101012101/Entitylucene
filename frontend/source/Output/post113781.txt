nfs and nfsd are not available in Mavericks <body> I find that there is no nfs and nfsd available on Mavericks. Does Apple remove it ?   P/S: I am trying to mount shared nfs drive in vagrant.  precode&gt; which nfs nfs not found &gt; which nfsd nfsd not found  /code/pre  <answer113815> Are these your error messages?  precodenfsd[3493]: conflicting exports for /path/to/folder, 10.0.0.x  nfsd[3493]: exports:56: export option conflict for /path/to/folder /code/pre  The solution is quite simple here, you just need to clear out the /etc/exports file and restart the nfsd service.   Here is the steps to solve it:  ol liGo to your Console app, filter by nfds and see what paths are conflicting/li liOpen the Terminal/li liEdit the /etc/exports | sudo vim /etc/exports/li liRemove the entries you want/li liSave and close the file/li liRestart nfsd service | sudo nfsd restart/li /ol  Now you should not have any conflicts and errors appearing in strongConsole app/strong, if it still appears then look into your file /etc/exports file again to remove the remaining conflicts.  <answer114745> In my case, I have nfsd. I didn't use it before, Mavericks don't remove it.  Check your $PATH variable.  <answer114748> nfsd is in /sbin which won't be on the default path  <comment133511> Thanks for your answer but it is not this error. `nfs` and `nfsd` simply don't exist. <comment134397> What version of which are you using the one I use which I thin is Apple's provides no output <comment134511> is it `/usr/sbin` you are talking about ? There seem to be no nfsd there. <comment134512> can you help me with the output of `which nfsd` <comment134520> No /sbin the answer is correct for my OSX
