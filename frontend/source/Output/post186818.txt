Erase partition without recreating one? <body> I've got an external USB hdd that I wish to use entirely as a TrueCrypt volume. There was one pre-formatted partition, so I'm trying to erase that with Disk Utility. But no matter what I do or try, whenever I Erase the partition (or the entire disk), it keeps automatically re-creating a new partition.  How do I just erase the partition, without recreating one, thus leaving the entire disk empty (i.e. without even one partition) ?  <answer186948> To remove all entries from the GPT and MBR tables, open the Disk Utility application and do the following.  ol liSelect your disk. /li liSelect Partition tab./li liSet Partition Layout to "1 Partition". /li liSet Format to "Free Space"./li liClick on the Option... button and select "Master Boot Record"./li liClick Ok to close the pop up window./li liClick the Apply button./li /ol  The image below was made just before clicking the Apply button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y00Tj.png" alt=""  <comment220632> Could you edit the post to show what `diskutil list disk1` (or whatever number your USB drive is) so I can get you a good command to use? Also why not use Disk Utility to make the partition marked as free space? <comment220633> Your issue aside - why would you want to use a solution that is no longer supported & has acknowledged security issues? http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net & http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/OtherPlatforms.html contain only instructions to remove TrueCrypt in order to use built-in solutions. <comment220715> @bmike `diskutil list disk2` says: `/dev/disk2`      `#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER`      `0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2`      `1:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED                2.0 TB     disk2s1`      (sorry for crappy formatting, can't insert linebreaks in comments) <comment220716> @Tetsujin: at the risk of going off topic here (altough I would happily discuss further about this in a chat), the so called 'acknowledged' security issues are highly debatable at best. Most likely scenario is the original truecrypt developers have been put under pressure (by NSA and similar organizations) to spread false rumors on security leaks, especially as they recommend a proprietary, closed source alternative from an American company (bitlocker) which is therefore almost guaranteerd to have backdoors. <comment220717> @Tetsujin Instead, I rather put more trust in the [independent and verifiable truecrypt audit](http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/) which clearly states that, some minor coding issues aside, truecrypt is absolutely safe. I'll prefer that over bitlocker any day of the week. Think about it: if truecrypt would actually be safe, in whose best interest is it to spread FUD about unknown security issues? And as for built-in solutions, I intend to access this disk on both OS X and Windows. And besides, unlike TrueCrypt, neither I nor anyone else can verify Microsoft's bitlocker or Apple's filevault. <comment220844> No one has asked the obvious question: Is the USB hdd using a GUID partitioning scheme or a Master Boot Record partitioning scheme? A MBR disk without any partitions will be result in a pop up message about an uninitialize disk. A GPT disk without any partitions will not. I suppose this is because an empty GPT disk will at least have an partition of type EE in the MBR table. <comment220967> Works like a charm, thank you very much!
