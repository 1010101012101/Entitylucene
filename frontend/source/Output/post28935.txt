How to clean Mac OS X before selling (Lion from App Store) <body> I have MacBook Pro (late 2007) which I planning to sell. Currently it's running Lion. Is it possible to clean all data but leave Lion?  <answer28936> Yes, Just hold down kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd during startup and Lion Recovery springs into action; It lets you choose from common utilities: You can choose to erase your hard drive and reinstall a fresh copy of Lion.  P.S: In order to reinstall OS X Lion, you will need to be connected to an Ethernet or Wi-Fi network  <comment71831> Note that you need to choose disk utility and erase the disc, not just "reinstall lion", which will try to fix a broken system but leave your files intact.
