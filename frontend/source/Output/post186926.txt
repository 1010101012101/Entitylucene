Is there a shortcut / an app to center the mouse on the current window? <body> I'm currently using 2 screens for work and I CMD-Tab a lot. But I always have to move the mouse to the other screen.  Is there a shortcut / an app to center the mouse on the current window?  <answer186928> BetterTouchTool, then add a keyboard/trackpad shortcut  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SXOI5.png" alt="cursorposition"  <answer186956> Keyboard Maestro can be setup to do this. I know this is a heavy weight solution for a simple task. However, if your already have KM or if you find value in it for automating other tasks,  it is a great option.   Here is how to set it up: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LFzlm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note: this is centered. The (0,0) is relative to the center of the window.   <comment220827> This won't move the mouse to the middle of active window but to fixed location. <comment220874> I made a correction. Originally answered this to center to the screen and not to the **current window** as requested.
