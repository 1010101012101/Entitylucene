Script that Automatically Does Something Every Day <body> I'm looking for a way to automatically run a shell script or command every emtime interval/em. I'm running a server and I want to backup some folders every day. I don't want to use time machine because the backups need to be just the raw data.  How do I write a daemon/application/script that will do this? The commands I need to run are pretty simple, and theres more than one I need, so it'd be great if there was a semi-generalized way to do this.  <answer31923> On Macs running 10.5 or earlier, I'll use crontab.   On Macs running 10.6 and newer, I'll use launchd. More details here http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/darwin/reference/manpages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html  <comment36616> launchd has been available since v10.4.  BTW, another option is to drop the script in /etc/periodic/daily, and it'll be run every morning at 3:15am. <comment36619> Is /etc/periodic is managed by crond or launchd? <comment36655> @globalnomad: Thats exactly what I was looking for. Thanks. <comment36656> Gordon, agree with you launched has been available since 10.4 (there's a pull-down showing just that on the link I provided). I moved my cron jobs to launchd starting 10.6 and the transition was uneventful (which is a good thing). <comment36658> Jason, starting with 10.6.6 /etc/periodic is managed by launched, in earlier OS X it is managed by cron. <comment36660> Kyle, you're welcome.
