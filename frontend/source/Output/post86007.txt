How to avoid duplicating files that goes on an iPad? <body> I would like to upload PDF files on an iPad. After adding them to the iTunes Library (iTunes - Files - Add to Library), and syncing, they are uploaded on the iPad, but are also copied locally in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Books.  Is there a way to prevent the files from being copied in my home directory ? I just want them at two places: an external hard drive, and the iPad.  <answer86029> On a Mac: Drag the files into iTunes with the emoption/em key down and the files won't be copied to your codeiTunes Media/code folder.  That's the exact result you like.  There is also the option to change it so you don't have to press option key: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KVyMk.jpg" alt="See this image"   You can press option key after changing that setting to copy it on purpose. (Exact opposite of default setting)  Good luck :)  <comment99184> OK, thanks, BTW, where in iTunes do you drop the files? I find iTunes very confusing.. <comment99185> You drag them and you see a blue border around the screen. You can drop them there. <comment99194> I don't know in which mode iTunes should be when I drop the pdf file in it, I have no feedback after the drop. What should the top left combo box read ? <comment99232> It shouldn't matter. Do you see a blue border around everything when you drag and drop something into iTunes? <comment99240> Yes. There is in fact no problem, I can drop it as long as it's blue. I hope some day a member of the iTunes team at Apple will open a book on user interfaces, and read it.
