What is iTunesHelper? <body> In my account settings under codeLogin/code there is an app called iTunesHelper. What does this app do? Can I remove it from the login apps without affecting iTunes, or will it be put back?  <answer13425> It is a program that launches iTunes whenever an iPhone/iPod/iPad is plugged in. If I recall correctly, if you remove it, iTunes will no longer automatically launch when an iPhone/iPod/iPad is plugged in.  <comment14191> I have this disabled for all my iPods and iPads so I guess I can safely remove it from the list? <comment14192> @RadekS: Yes, you can. <comment14222> @RadekS: Yes, you can remove it, but future updates of iTunes may bring it back, so keep an eye on it.
