any way to check validity of Apple Lossless (m4a) files? <body> I'm moving my music library, which is FLAC files, from Windows to Mac. I'm exploring several ways of doing this, including (1) using an OS X media player that actually supports FLAC files (such as JRiver), (2) using iTunes and converting my FLAC files to Apple Lossless.  Looking at (2) first, I test converted a few FLAC files to Apple Lossless, using Foobar2000 on Windows. My problem is that iTunes is not recognizing them. (They don't show up in my library when I import the folder tree containing them.)  Although there may be multiple reasons for that, I want to focus right now on any reason that the m4a files might be corrupted. How can I inspect or diagnose any problems in these files? Is there another OS X media player besides iTunes I could use to verify that they are, or are not, playable?  <comment305852> You can inspect audio files with Audacity, it will show a waveform. http://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/      Or you can try to play them with VLC http://videolan.org <comment305879> I'd try [Max](http://sbooth.org/Max/) or [XLD](http://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html) on the Mac to check if it's Foobar not doing something the Mac needs to recognise
