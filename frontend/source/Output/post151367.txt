I Installed Server.app on Yosemite to enable caching, but see many server processes in Task Manager (_xcsbuild and _devicemgr and _calendar processes) <body> _xcsbuild and _devicemgr and _calendar processes seem to be the bulk.  None of them are using significant rescues but there are dozens.  How do I identify the launcctl jobs and turn them off?  <answer156937> You can stop the _xcsbuild "session" by running codesudo xcrun xcscontrol --shutdown/code. This will also stop it from starting at launch.  Although it's probably a better idea to use xcscontrol, the individual launchctl tasks are:  ul licodecom.apple.xcsd.plist/code/li licodecom.apple.xcscouch.plist/code/li licodecom.apple.xcsredis.plist/code/li licodecom.apple.xcscontrol.plist/code/li /ul  You can also delete all the remaining data by running codesudo xcrun xcscontrol --reset/code.  I'm still looking myself for _devicemgr and _calendar, but just this one is enough to let you shut down/reboot without the warning.
