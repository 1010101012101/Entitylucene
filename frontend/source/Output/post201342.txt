Is it possible to find out an app download / installation date on iOS? <body> Is there a way to find out the exact date of installation of an application that was added to my phone?  <answer201364> No, there is no way of finding out exactly when an app was purchased, but you can go to the App Store and select Updates, then go to Purchased and see if the app was purchased (paid or free) before/after other apps. The list is sorted by newest on the top.  <comment242704> Welcome to Ask Different! It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of combining your questions into one. That way, it helps the people answering your question and also others hunting for at least one of your questions. I edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it in a separate post. Thanks! <comment335222> There is an application call [iExplorer](https://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/). From this tool (even with the free version) you can achieve what you expect.
