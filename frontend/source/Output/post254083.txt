Why are deleted Photos on Mac staying on my iPhone 6s? <body> After Yosemite update on Mac, how can I get deleted photos on computer to be deleted on my 6S as well? I'm deleting in Photos on Mac in Recently Deleted folder....with immediate deletion and not waiting, but they are staying on my iPhone.
