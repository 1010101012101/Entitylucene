No audio when playing mp4 video from MacBook Pro to Apple TV <body> When viewing some files with quicktime on my retina MacBook Pro (Sierra 10.12.6), I can view it on Apple TV and the sound works fine.  However some files produce the following behaviour:  ol liSelect Apple TV / Airplay in Quicktime Video appears on TV, but no sound (on TV or laptop). /li liI click on the Sound Pref Pane and select Apple TV as the output. There is a slight pause, then the video switches back to the laptop, and the sound now comes out of the Apple TV/li /ol  This is a similar problem to those reported here and here, but it's not exactly the same because the solutions suggested don't work for me, and this is consistently happening but only for a subset of my video files.  <comment372650> Have you tried other (ahem, better) video players, like VLC?  ATV's themselves (and QT too, I think) are VERY sensitive to the audio encoding, especially if you ONLY encoded with mult-channel sound (no stereo track).  VLC's Get Info window will show you the encoding details (or you can use ffprobe if you prefer the Terminal), and maybe you can detect a difference between the files that work and those that don't.
