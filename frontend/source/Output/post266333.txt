How to show italic in vim in iTerm2 <body> The beloved Solarized seems to apply italic font for comments, but when I am using it in Vim in iTerm2, it does not.  So, everything including comments are displayed in roman (normal) fonts.  Even if I select Menlo font, which has italic version I can see in iTerm2's preferences window, the comments are rendered as roman.   Together with the fact that comments are in light gray, and normal text in (not very bright) white, comments become rather difficult to be distinguished with normal text.  To me this is a pity to the otherwise great color scheme.  I did some searching but many advices are old and do not solve. Mine is Sierra on MacBook Air.  <answer267261> You have to update your codeTERMINFO/code file.  Thanks to wincent's video and his github pagesbr Watch the video and look at his github pages, they're excellent.  I have the following note stored on my HD:  We can have emitalics/em in the terminal.  This works in iTerm as well as Terminal.  We have to adapt the terminfo database to tell it to display italics.  strongVerify/strong that code~/.terminfo/78//code directory exists, and inside that directory is a codexterm-256color/code file.  Copy the following into a file (which I named "xterm-256color.terminfo.txt")  precodexterm-256color|xterm with 256 colors and italic,   sitm=\E[3m, ritm=\E[23m,   use=xterm-256color, /code/pre  Next execute the following comand:  precodetic -o ~/.terminfo/78/ xterm-256color.terminfo.txt /code/pre  To check that the terminal does the right thing:  ul liwith bash or zsh:  precodeecho `tput sitm`italics`tput ritm` `tput smso`standout`tput rmso` /code/pre/li liwith fish:  precodeecho (tput sitm)'italics' (tput ritm) (tput smso)'standout'(tput rmso) /code/pre/li /ul  I guess at the moment most vim terminal colorschemes don't set italic as a style. To check this do:br code:hi Comment/code if the reply contains codecterm=italic/code you're done. If not add codehighlight Comment cterm=italic/code to your vimrc (strongbelow/strong setting your colorscheme).  <comment335310> Wow! After doing these, with the test you gave, "italic" and "standout" both works, but opening a cpp in vim does not render comments italic. Is this Solarized's problem? <comment335318> Oh! I notice that MacVim's GUI (i.e. the separate window that prompts) can display italic fonts, but if opened in the terminal (with `mvim -v`), it cannot. Is is normal? <comment335366> If you do in vim: `:hi Comment` does it say `cterm=italic`? If not Solarized doesn't set this. You can do this in your vimrc with `highlight Comment cterm=italic` <comment335449> IT WORKS!!!! MY COMMENTS ARE ITALIC NOW!!! I will tell the world the good news!!! (I always thought Solarized set this by default) <comment346905> In my machine (arch linux), cterm=standout displayed *italics*, and the command above could only display the word *standout* but in italics. <comment346906> And there were no ~/.terminfo directory and hence no files in it. What is that **78** directory part though? <comment346953> I just tried on a Manjaro (based on arch) VM `echo \`tput sitm\`italics\`tput ritm\` \`tput smso\`standout\`tput rmso\`` and it gave the expected result  (italics & standout) without applying the patch. This is an xfce4-terminal. The 78 directory part is showing up on the 2 Macs I have available, I'm not sure if this is just a Mac thing or more general unix. If you look at wincent's video `~/.terminfo` is a directory where the patched terminfo is stored. Presumably when starting the terminal this file is read, instead of the one in `/usr/share/x/terminfo/xterm-256color`
