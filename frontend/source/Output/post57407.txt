Include Images with Reply in Mail? <body> In Mail (connected to my work Exchange server, if that matters), when I forward an email which contains inline images they are preserved.  However, if I emreply/em to the email then they are not preserved.  They are instead replaced with something like this:  precode&lt;image001.jpg&gt; /code/pre  Is there a way to preserve the images in a reply?  <answer57417> In Mail.app go to the Edit menu, go down to Attachments, then select Include Original Attachments with Reply.  <comment65955> I suppose that is because it usually makes no sense to include attachments again in a reply. I have no solution to your question, though. <comment65956> @leberwurstsaft: In the simplest cases, I would agree.  In longer email chains where people get added to the conversation late in the game it's very handy. <comment65959> If someone comes in late you can always forward them the original mail for reference. Otherwise you'd have to send the images back and forth all the time. Not exactly space-saving ;) <comment65969> Great, would've never occured to me to look for what are essentially preferences in the Edit menu :o <comment115595> Me either.  Not very intuitive.  I always expect to find it in Preferences  Composing and end up back here every time :) <comment137460> That is a good solution. But a more decent solution would be: "don't include attachments when reply unless it is an inline image". But I don't think it would be possible.
