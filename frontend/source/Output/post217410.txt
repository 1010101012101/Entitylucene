How do I get all three monitors to work with 2015 Mac mini? <body> I have a 2015 Mac mini with two monitors hooked up out TB-VGA adapters. A HP and a Compaq. Today I added (or tried to add) a samsung 24" with the HDMI. Since adding the samsung, I can only get my computer to recognize one of the original monitors I had hooked up at a time with the TB-VGA adapters. How can I get all three monitors to work?
