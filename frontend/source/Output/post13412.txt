Purchased video on iTunes rather than gifting, can this be corrected? <body> My friend tried to gift me a film in the iTunes store but he says that somehow he "received" it by mistake (his mistake, most likely).  What are his options now.  Can he:  ol liReturn the purchase/li li"Gift" the purchase to me/li liCall someone to correct the error and reassign the item to me instead?/li /ol  <answer13414> No.  From the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions:     All sales and rentals of products are final.   <answer13417> bckbck is correct in terms of the letter of the law. All sales are final. However, your friend emmay/em have some luck contacting iTunes customer service and explaining the situation. They're aware that mistakes happen, and are sometimes happy to rectify them for you - though they are not obliged to do so.  All iTunes customer service is carried out via email. Here's a link to an email page your friend can use to explain the issue to iTunes customer service.  <comment14189> Many thanks for your advice <comment14229> No problem.
