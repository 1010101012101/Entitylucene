Lightweight "sounds similar" radio app (OSX) <body> Is there a Mac app that offers one-click or one-keystroke access to a box where I type in a song, artist, or genre I want to hear "sounds similar" radio for (a la Pandora), hit enter, and listen?  Kudos for an app that's very lightweight.  <answer80336> Try MPme.com. They have a great discovery radio app.  <answer99571> Rdio is close. It does not have a menubar icon, but in app: âŒ˜F - search - Start station.   App supports fullscreen and play and skip buttons on Mac keyboard. Miniplayer can be on top but does not allow search described above.   <comment92707> The OP mentioned that they wanted a *Mac* app for this and it appears this only works on iOS. Are you aware of something that works for OSX?
