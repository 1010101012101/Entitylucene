Show sent emails in my inbox on iPad <body> Is there a way to make my sent emails show up in my inbox on the iPad, similar to how it is shown in the gmail web view?  I can do this in the Mac app by creating a smart mailbox that includes both inbox and sent messages. Is there something I can set up, either on the iPad or in gmail, that would let me do this?  <answer54568> You could always simply view the "Gmail/All Mail" folder.  Inside Mail on your iPad, go to Mailboxes- Gmail (under accounts) - All Mail.  You'll see messages you've sent as well.  If Gmail is your only mail account, simply stay in the All Mail folder all the time.    <answer54594> If you send the message, send it CC: to your own mail address to receive a copy into your inbox.  <answer73639> Go to SettingsMail, Contacts, Calendars and turn on "Always BCC Myself". Hope that helps!  <comment62509> Why can't you just add yourself as a recipient? <comment73326> I cc myself, but for some reason I only see the message in the SENT message folder, but not the INBOX. This seems quirky. Does anyone else have this type of behavior in Apple Mail.
