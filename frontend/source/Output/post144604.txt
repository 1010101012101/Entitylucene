iTunes won't show my Cloud music? <body> My iTunes keeps crashing whenever I try to show my Cloud Music. I go into Preferences  Store and check the box to show the music, but then it tries to load it and it crashes. It'll keep crashing each time I load iTunes unless i check the box off, but I want my Cloud Music seen. How do I fix this problem?  <answer144609> If you go to Apple then Software Update and you see an update there for iTunes, do the update.  I believe this issue was suppose to be resolved in that update.  If not, you could try signing out of the iTunes Store and signing back in. Sometimes refreshing the account information manually will help.  Lastly, you can reinstall Mac OS X from the recovery partition. Hold down opt key on boot, choose Recovery 10.X.X. On the resulting window, choose reinstall Mac OS X and then choose your hard drive.  strongCreate a backup before performing last step/strong  <answer197224> One thing that you could do is try turning the iCloud Music Library on and off in codeiTunes/code  Another is by going into codeiTunes/code and signing in and out of your Apple ID.

It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment235767> Thanks @patrix. I'll definitely keep this in mind in the future.
