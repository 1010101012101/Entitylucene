How to text to an iPod <body> (Sorry about the title, I had trouble figuring out what to name it).  Anyway, a few days ago, someone asked me if they could text me. I readily agreed but then discovered that they couldn't because if they sent to my email it went to my email.  I don't want that person's stuff in my email, I want it in my texts.  So, I did all that prefacing... All I would like to know is, what information does my friend need to be able to text me? (Yes, the person does have an Apple).  **I'm currently running iOS 8.3 on my iPod touch **  <answer180911> To receive messages on your iPod, as long as the other person is using a device which is iMessage capable, they will be able to send you texts via iMessage.  To set up iMessage:  ol liOn device, go to Settings - Messages/li liTurn on iMessage/li liOnce set up, make sure you choose your email address as one that can receive iMessages (tied to your Apple ID)/li liHave friend send messages to you via iMessage as they would a normal text to one of the addresses provided in iMessage setup/li /ol  More information can be found here and here  <comment215035> What iOS version is your iPod running? <comment215036> @smoooosher iOS 8.3.
