17" mid-2009 MBP, 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo: can it take 16GB RAM? <body> Does anyone have this unibody from mid-2009? Has anyone upgraded it to 16GB RAM? If so, is it good news?  Thanks!  <answer246799> If you mean either the 'SD' or the 'Mid 2009' then no, it can take 8GB only.    EveryMac is a fabulous resource for that type of info, including in some cases, whether a machine can actually take more RAM than the Apple official original spec claims.  <answer246800> I don't have this MacBook Pro anymore as I sold it but I do know that it can't take 16GB of RAM, only up to 8GB.
