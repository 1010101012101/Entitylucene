Looking for an app to amplify audio from YouTube <body> Years ago I saw someone use a program for Windows and I was hoping that someone can tell me if there is a Mac equivalent!  Say you are watching a YouTube video and the audio is up full but it's still quiet. The audio on the video is out of sync too.  You open this program and you can increase the audio even though it's full on YouTube. You can also speed up the audio so that it is in sync with the video.  Is there an app available for OS X that allows me to do this?  <answer166771> Personalty when I came across a youtube video with low audio output I use a app called VLC player and its audio to boost the signal.  The VLC player is free.  Just copy the youtube video link in the VLC player than use its Audio to modify it to your liking.  It also comes with a very handy Audio Mixer allowing you to set up full range of audio output.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PbO17.jpg" alt="audio"  VLC also allows you to synchronize the Audio-Video playback and more.  For example while you're watching the video, just press the J or K keys to move the audio back or forward 50 milliseconds (or more), respectively.   <answer166782> A costly solution: the Boom app: http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/  It boosts the system volume  <answer166791> You can use Audio Hijack Pro:  ul li$32 /li liAmplify a specific application or the entire system audio:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IvH35.png" alt="enter image description here"     ol   liLaunch Audio Hijack Pro./li   liOpen the main window by choosing Window  Audio Hijack Pro./li   liIn the left-hand column, select the program you wish to amplify./li   liClick one of the "Click here to insert effect" squares./li   liChoose FourFX Effect  Gain.

Exactly what I was looking for. I was aware of this program but I hadn't realised it was capable of doing this. Cheers! <comment195559> +1, didn't even know VLC could do this. <comment195654> Looks really cool! I think this would be my ideal solution although I'm not sure I can justify paying for it. Good find!
