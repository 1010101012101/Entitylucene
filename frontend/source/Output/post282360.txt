iOS Spotlight search for, then edit a contact <body> I can't for the life of me understand how, in iOS 10.3.1, I do what I've done many times before iOS 9/10, namely:  ol liSpotlight search for a contact/li liThen edit that contact/li /ol  This is what I see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nr8X3.jpg" width="320" alt="best search hit"  emBest search hit/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2j3RO.png" width="320" alt="selecting the contact"  emCancel, Notes, Share Contact/em  I.e. no way to edit nor to view it in the contacts app. I don't have 3D Touch.   <answer282362> From your second screenshot, 3D Touch on the profile photo, then tap on the name at the top of the popup to open the contact in Contacts.app.  Without 3D Touch, this is not possible. To search contacts, you can use the Search bar at the top of the Contacts or Phone apps.  <comment355638> I have a 4" phone without 3D Touch :-/ <comment355639> @Andreas Does a long press work? <comment355640> Unfortunately not. Thanks for the suggestion <comment355641> @Andreas It appears you're out of luck according to a thread over on ASC (edited answer with link). That seems pretty ridiculous <comment355681> I'll give you a ☑️ and apple a ‍♂️. You get someone's new details and try to edit their contact card in front of them, and it takes forever because you start by walking down a dead end. It's embarrassing.
