For Mountain Lion, how does Apple define the Transparent App Lifecycle (TAL)? <body> h1Definition/h1  Apple's talagent(8) OS X Manual Page (2010-09-01, long before Lion was released) mentions but strongdoes not define/strong the emTransparent App Lifecycle feature/em.   Some time before Lion was released, I understood that the TAL comprised:  ul liauto save/li liversions/li liresume./li /ul  Now, I'm not so sure. (Suspect that versions are not strictly speaking within the TAL, because not all apps that support the cycle also support versions.)  Please, can anyone give a better answer than the one below?  Something shorter and more definite – maybe with reference to a single e-mail or page from Apple – will be ideal. Thanks.   h2Side note, an issue with 10.8/h2  precodemacbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$ sw_vers ProductName:    Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.8 BuildVersion:   12A269 macbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$ man talagent macbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$ which talagent macbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$ talagent -bash: talagent: command not found macbookpro08-centrim:~ gjp22$  /code/pre  – the command can not be run manually as described in the manual.
