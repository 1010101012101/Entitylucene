ITunes connect contact us support option not working <body> I log into my iTunes account and want to contact Apple support. Under Contact us and select topic, the only option for me is "select". I can't stroll and select anything so I can't have my problem reported. Thank you for helps   <comment336521> report a different type of issue, some of them allow you to contact support and some of them don't.
