What tool can I use to manage notes and/or bookmarks for a collection of PDF files? <body> I am doing some research and I do put lots of notes and bookmarks in the books (PDF files).  I am looking for a tools that will allow me to see and search inside all these notes.  I supposed that this tools should be able to scan a directory with PDF files, for notes and keep them in sync.  <answer16953> Sounds like you need  Papers  <answer62056> What about Evernote.. There may be issues like limited uploaded. But you may go for premium option.  <answer62063> You should try Mendelely, a Reference Manager with Dropbox-like sharing/syncing. It reads Comments from PDFs, but sometimes mixes them up. In my example i had saved an Article as a PDF with the Headline as the Filename, but Mendeley indexed my Comment as the Filename.   You should also take a look at Eaglefiler, as the name says more Archiv-oriented.  <comment18463> I try to build a comparison matrix at https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuAbgmBsosYRdGFnSWdNOGtNY2lkUlBJZmc1cGxDcEE&hl=en_US <comment18466> Sorry, but Papers is not able to recognize standard annotations/notes made with Preview or Adobe Reader. They recognize only their own annotations. <comment18519> Your column for BibDesk is mostly wrong. Try using BibDesk + Skim. It lets you organize, search, and see notes.
