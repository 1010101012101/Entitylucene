How to keep /Volumes symbolic links from getting auto-deleted? <body> I moved my code/Users/code directory to a separate disk/partition (to get it off my SSD boot disk) as per this post.  However, some things (like double-clicks of .html files to be viewed in a an Opera browser) still look for /Users in code/Volumes/Users/code, which doesn't normally exist.  Can solve by manually making code/Volumes/Users -&gt; /Users/code symbolic link, but said sym link file apparently gets auto-deleted (possibly at reboot), or at least, it disappears without my deleting it.  How to prevent this autodeletion?
