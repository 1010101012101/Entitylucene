How do I search PDFs in Acrobat in Safari using command-f, without an extra buttom press? <body> I like using Acrobat within Safari as a convenience. But when I try to search in a PDF with command-F, it first brings up the emSafari/em search box, which steals the focus from Acrobat's own search box. This amounts of a lot of annoying extra clicks or button presses to search in PDFs from inside the browser. How can I short-circuit this behavior?  And if there's another in-browser PDF reader that avoids this problem (and is also free and is light/fast/safe), I'd take that as an answer as well.  <answer148131> You are oping the PDF files using the Safari PDF reader.   You need the AdobePDFViewer.plugin to replace the Safari build in PDF reader.   Here are the instructions how to do that.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XTMDT.jpg" alt="pdf"  strongUpdate:/strong  Based on our discussion and your very specific needs here is a proposal.  Reassign the Safari default for "Find" keyboard short cut.  Open sys pref- keyboard - shortcuts.  Click on app shortcut  Select Safari  Type "Find..." (the 3 dots are important)  Select new short cut "kbdshift/kbd + kbdcmd/kbd + kbdF/kbd"  Now when you use the "cmd -F" only Adobe search will show  When you use the shift- cmd -F the Safari search will show up.  <comment174580> Just tested, the instructions you posted don't fix the problem (and I also kind of like the default Ask behavior). <comment174582> Also, my version of Safari didn't appear to have a built-in reader. When I got my computer, download+Preview was the default behavior. So I installed the Adobe reader plugin. <comment174583> So it should work now if you have the Adobe reader installed. <comment174586> Except I've had the reader installed this whole time, and no it doesn't work because I just tried it. Cmd-F still brings up both search boxes, and Safari's search box gets the focus by default. <comment174590> You could kill Safari' ability to read PDF files all together. defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitOmitPDFSupport -bool YES <comment174627> I explicitly *want* to read PDFs inside my browser.
