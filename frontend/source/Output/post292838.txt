macOS mixing up Desktop Spaces and Monitors <body> I have 2 external monitors hooked up to my MacBook (running Sierra). Every time I wake it up form sleeping it has the Desktop-Spaces mixed up between the integrated screen and one of the monitors. Thus I need to rearrange ~5spaces 4 times per day.  Is there a way to avoid that?  <comment369473> Try resetting [NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063).
