My Apple Watch won't pair with my iPhone 7 <body> My Apple Watch won't pair with my iPhone 7.   When I tap "start pairing" I get a message saying that I should update my Apple Watch. But when I click on "update" it shows that there isn't any update and that my Apple Watch is up to date.  How can I resolve this?
