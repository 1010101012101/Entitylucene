AppleScript Syntax Error <body> For some reason, when I attempt to run this code in AppleScript, I get the following error:     Syntax Error      Expected end of line but found “"”.   Here is the troubled portion of my code:  precodeif a = "911" then tell application "System Events"      kestroke "a" using {command down, shift down} end tell /code/pre  <answer228410> Try to use codekeystroke/code instead of kestroke  <comment278476> I think you might have an error in the latter part of your code, you say `kestroke` but I think you mean `keystroke` <comment278591> You have a typo in line 2. Use `keystroke` instead.
