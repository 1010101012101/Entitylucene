Where is my Java SDK 7u7 installed? <body> I downloaded and installed Java 1.7 from this site.  When I run the Java Control Panel, I could check I have it correctly installed.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sZLCq.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, when I checked the Java version from command line, the version that I use is Java 1.6.  precodejava -version java version "1.6.0_33" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_33-b03-424-11M3720) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.8-b03-424, mixed mode) /code/pre  The system directory doesn't have the 1.7.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AEp8X.png" alt="enter image description here"  What's wrong with this?  ul liWhere is the Java 1.7 is installed?/li liHow can I make the Java 1.7 as default Java?/li /ul  <answer63700> I found Java 1.7 SDK in code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_07.jdk/code, and all the binaries in code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_07.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/code.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/amf9V.png" alt="enter image description here"  And by clicking the jdk file, I could arrange the order so that Java SE 7 is executed first.  precodejava -version java version "1.7.0_07" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_07-b10) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.3-b01, mixed mode) /code/pre  And I could also bring up the app from /Applications/Utilities/Java Preferences.app  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/65M2M.png" alt="enter image description here"  For eclipse, I could add one line in code/Applications/eclipse/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini/code to teach eclipse what Java it will use :   precode-vm /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/bin/java /code/pre  <comment73729> You really didn't give anyone much time to provide an answer eh? Good to know though <comment105234> This answer is great if you have the JDK installed.  But what if you only have the JRE installed?  Nothing shows up in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`.
