Need to know what's the contents of /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist from Mac OS X Mountain Lion? <body> I accidentally issued the following command:  code# launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons//code  I wish to see outputs of mac os x mountain lion codelaunchd% list/code command. See below on pastie the current running services.

How to restore Daemon startup state from there?   strongEdit/strong: http://pastie.org/private/rwvizio9isyklcsunm4vw - the list of actual running services output from codelaunchd% list/code  strongEdit2/strong: http://pastie.org/7748739 - actual code/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist/code file contents.  <answer88670> codelaunchctl load -w/code modifies code/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd.peruser.501/overrides.plist/code and codesudo launchctl load -w/code modifies code/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist/code.  Try restoring the file that was modified from a backup and restarting. Or you could probably even just delete it. On my mostly untouched 10.8 VM the peruser plist is empty, and the root one looks like this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.ftpd&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.mrt&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.apple.smbd&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;org.ntp.ntpd&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  com.apple.ftpd doesn't even exist, com.apple.smbd is disabled by default, and org.ntp.ntpd is not disabled by default, so it just disables com.apple.mrt.  <comment103844> They were already running, notice "Already loaded". So the command you used essentially did nothing. There's nothing to restore either, since those things automatically get loaded at startup. <comment103848> @l'L'l: Nope; the ones it printed messages for were already loaded, but the ones it *didn't* print messages for weren't (and probably shouldn't be). BTW, Marcel: I take it you ran this as root? <comment103852> Yes, unfortunately. I've restarted it and it looks like it's not starting up any unwanted daemon, but I'm still not sure what the implications, if any. <comment103865> I've edited the question with current running services, if someone would compare with another mountain lion in which the mentioned command was not issued. thanks <comment105915> My root file has a lot of keys with Disable false, maybe the command I ran has indeed started every daemon... I'm still stuck as how do I recover to a more or less original state of startup daemons. <comment105926> Just try deleting all entries that contain `keyDisabled/keyfalse/` from the overrides.plist. On my account overrides.plist also enables for example com.apple.locate and org.apache.httpd but you can re-enable them manually. <comment106434> I'll try that as soon as I get home. I just hate that Apple did not followed closer to BSD start/stop daemons mechanisms, or maybe I hate them because I don't have the patience to learn to use launchctl and other utilities.
