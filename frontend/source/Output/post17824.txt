How can I stop unwanted notifications from Google Calendar on an iPhone? <body> My wife finds that her iPhone constantly reminds her of google calendar events (accessed via the exchange trick). None of the google events have reminders enabled. The phone preferences don't ask for reminders. Yet reminders she gets.  <answer20273> This is actually a default setting by Google that can be changed.  To change this setting   ol liGo to your Google Calendar settings found in the top right under the gear icon./li liSelect the strongCalendar/strong tabs/li liClick the strongShared: Edit settings/strong link for the calendar you want to edit./li liSelect the strongNotifications/strong tab/li liClick the strongremove/strong link next to the reminders you don't want./li /ol  emPlease note that this will only fix events created from this point forward, you will still have to change all the notifications in events that were previously setup./em  <answer175646> There is a setting on your iPhone for calendar notifications you can turn off:  ol liOpen Settings./li liGo to Notifications./li liGo to Calendar./li liGo to Shared Calendar Changes./li liTurn off all the notifications here./li /ol  <answer216716> Go to Google on your iPhone (Google App), and the first story that has the hamburger menu (3 stacked dots), click it and choose Customize Google Now.  You can then turn off various things.  For example, I have no interest in Sports so I turn off these notifications.   <comment19486> Go to an event that receives notifications, then edit it. What does it say in the "Alert" field? <comment19487> It says, 'Alert 10 minutes before'. But I don't know where that came from. <comment19488> I have the same thing! I have looked everywhere but can't turn it off. This means waking up at night because my iPhone tells me I have a free day! <comment22474> Are these "all-day" events?
