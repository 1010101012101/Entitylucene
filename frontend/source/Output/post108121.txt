Loss of contacts and calendar on iPhone 4s with iOS 7.0.3 update <body> I did the latest software update a few days ago and just this morning without changing anything, I lost a lot of contacts and my calendar is empty. I have never synced my iPhone with iTunes or iCloud. Can someone help me with this?  <answer108699> If you upgraded from a major previous iOS version such as iOS 6 to iOS 7.0.3, the update will wipe clean your iPhone. If you did not back up the device before upgrading, your contacts and calendars will unfortunately be lost.
