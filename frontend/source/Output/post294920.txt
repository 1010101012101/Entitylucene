How to connect to the PPTP VPN in ubuntu 16.04? <body> As Apple has stopped to support PPTP VPN. I have installed virtual box with ubuntu 16.04 to be able to connect to my customer which uses PPTP VPN.  I cannot establish the connection, It always fails     Can any one tell will this setup even work of establishing a PPTP VPN   connection in the guest operating system (ubuntu 16.04) if the host   operating system does not support it (Mac os sierra)?   <comment372399> This isn't an OSX issue. If your VM can access the internet normally it should be able to connect to the vpn unless you misconfigured it. If you're trying to somehow connect to the ubuntu vm through OSX that's a whole different issue <comment372793> Right but that's just confirmed that your VM setup is borked. Define not working <comment372794> I cannot establish the VPN connection from my ubuntu 17.04 guest operating system running in virtual box . May be the problem is with ubuntu itself, I will try with older version of  ubuntu <comment372877> Do you know what's the implementation of the PPTP server? I had an OSX PPTP VPN server for quite a few years and never got it to work on a non apple device. <comment372901> I have no clue regarding the details of the PPTP server as it belongs to my customer, I have no details regarding that :(
