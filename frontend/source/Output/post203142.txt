How can I delete a photo off my camera roll, but keep it in my album? <body> I'm hitting the hide button, but it's still showing up in my camera roll. I want to delete some photos from my camera roll, but keep them in my album.  <answer203143> You could upgrade your iPhone to iOS 8 (which you should do anyway for security reasons). It doesn't have a Camera Roll, so your photo definitely won't be in it.  <answer259707> When you select hide option of a specific image or set of images, then it's only hidden from moments, collections and years. But still visible in Albums and camera roll. In iOS any update came so far cannot completely hide images. If you want, you have to install a third party application to hide them.  strongNote/strong   That third party app is not connected with iOS photos. You just have to transfer your images on iOS photos to third party app and delete them from the iOS photos app.  <comment246325> The Camera Roll was renamed "All Photos" in iOS 8. It is the same collection, as far as I am aware. <comment246330> Sure, but the photo won't be in the Camera Roll, which is what the question asked for. And the new name for it in fact answers the question, since it should be pretty clear that if a photo is removed from "All Photos" then it's been completely deleted. <comment246371> It's not a helpful answer, though. @Mel was clearly asking to remove photos from the collection — whether named Camera Roll or All Photos — and keep them in an album.
