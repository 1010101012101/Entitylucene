How to Secure erase files in OS X without moving the files into trash? <body> My Question is I want to erase a file in OS X Securely (like the function of "Secure Empty Trash") so that, the file cannot be recovered by using recovery tools. I don't want to empty the trash. It is possible to erase Files Securely in OS X without moving the file to Trash ?   <answer57897> You can always use the terminal command coderm/code with the code-P/code option:     [Option strong-P/strong will]    Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.   If you're not handy with the Terminal, just:  ol liOpen the strongTerminal.app/strong (Found in /Applications/Utilities)./li liType codecd/code  and drag the folder which contains the file you want to delete, to the terminal window./li liType coderm -P FileName.extension/code and hit kbdEnter/kbd/li /ol  <answer58352> codesrm/code is another shell utility for deleting files securely. It uses the 35-pass Gutmann algorithm by default, but code-s/code (overwriting files with random data once) is faster and should be secure enough for most purposes.  <comment66643> Or combine step 2 and 3 by typing `rm -P ` followed by directly dragging the file into the terminal window. It's also worth mentioning that depending on the sector/cluster allocation process it is usually not guaranteed that the whole file will be overwritten. If you really care about these things use FileVault 2 to encrypt the whole drive. <comment66917> TBH i think finding a "fix" now will just be delaying the inevitable change to this look that'll probably come with all new versions <comment67087> In fact, choosing "Secure Empty Trash" in Finder invokes `srm`. <comment67094> thanks for the answer. I will try this :)
