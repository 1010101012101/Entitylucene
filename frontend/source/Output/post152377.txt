Is there a log file for App Nap? <body> I use a piece of specialty software that seems to be dealing badly with App Nap. Is there a way to retroactively list when App Nap acted on a specific process?  The Console log shows symptoms (Spindump reports when an app is throttled for excessive wakelocks or cpu use) but I can't find anything related to the third type of App Nap throttling (priority reduction), quoting from developer docs:     For any app that is not performing important user work, App Nap triggers a number of measures, including:      ul   liPriority reduction, which reduces the process priority of an app so that it receives a smaller share of available processor time/li   liTimer throttling, which reduces the frequency with which an appâ€™s timers are fired/li   liI/O throttling, which reduces the rate at which an app can read or write data from a device while foreground apps need the device/li   /ul   <answer152409> app nap events are shown in the system.log (the easiest way to find them is to open up Console.app and look in All Messages).  <comment179370> Not what you asked - but you can disable app nap on a per-app basis. Find the application in the Finder, go to File - Get Info, and then the check the box next to "Prevent App Nap" in the General section. <comment179400> That's what I was referring to when I said that I can see cpu /timer throttling in the Console, but I can't seem to find priority reduction entries <comment180135> The checkbox doesn't appear for the app in question, not sure why. I've disabled in the app's plist using the following line: defaults write com.app.whatever NSAppSleepDisabled 1 which has improved things but I'm still seeing throttling in the console...
