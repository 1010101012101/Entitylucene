Macbook Pro 17" mid-2009 restarts immediately after shutdown <body> Requires a small amount of backstory: I have a mid-2009 17" Macbook Pro (machine A). Something recently died in it and it was becoming increasingly difficult to use. A friend gave me his identical machine (B) which he hadn't been using for over a year. After having THAT machine (B) checked out, I had the technician (not at an Apple store, but at a place that is Apple certified) swap the hard drives. Note: I forgot to shut down machine A. It had been put in sleep mode.  After the hard drives were swapped, I booted B, now with A's hard drive, and it seemed to work ok. I shut it down...only to have it immediately restart. I shut it down again. And it restarted again. I shut it down using the power button...only to have it restart again. We repeated this a number of times, to no avail. It will immediately restart if powered off or shut down.  The technician played with it for about 15 more minutes, but the only thing he was able to tell me was a work-around. Shut it down using the menu, and then as soon as it begins to restart, press and hold the power button until the light indicator on the front edge goes dark. That DOES work, but I'd really rather the thing shut down when I tell it to.  Anyone got any suggestions? Does my not having shut down machine A before having its hard drive put into machine B have anything to do with it?  <comment253418> Welcome to ask different stack exchange. I think you should reinstall the operating system. What version of os x is it running? <comment253438> El Capitan. Just updated it (as machine A) a few days ago.
