What contributes to my iPhone iCloud backup size? <body> Settings lists my phone's iCloud "Backup Size" as 2.2 GB (excluding other phones and general "Documents &amp; Data") though all of its apps turned "on" for backup below don't even approach 0.5 GB when summed. What else is contributing to this unexpectedly large number, and how can I reduce them?  <answer100660> Per Apple, this is what is backed up:  ul liPurchased music, movies, TV shows, apps, and books/li liPhotos and videos in your Camera Roll/li liDevice settings/li liApp data/li liHome screen and app organization/li liiMessage, text (SMS), and MMS messages/li liRingtones/li liVisual Voicemail/li /ul  Things like purchased content, Messages.app, ringtones, and voicemails are not actually explicitly listed in the backup screens for you to see how much space will be used. This would account for the difference.
