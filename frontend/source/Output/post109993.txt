Netflow data from Apple Airport? <body> I am interested in getting netflow data from an apple airport. Netflow is a Cisco and internet standard that is used in network monitoring. My airport extreme supports SNMP and I use that for monitoring ,but netflow would give me a list of hosts. Any idea how to get this information?  <answer109995> Whilst an AirPort Extreme does support SNMP as you mentioned, strongthey do not export Netflow data/strong (unless something has changed recently).  <answer113687> I'm collecting netflow data from my Airport Express. I have an OpenBSD machine acting as the router for my AIRPORT VLAN (one of very many VLANs) and use the following in codepf.conf/code (it collects pflow data for all passed packets):  precodeset state-defaults pflow  # AIRPORT is the "descr" for the associated VLAN interface pass in  on AIRPORT     all label "AIRPORT in" pass out on AIRPORT     all label "AIRPORT out" /code/pre  Send the collected pflow data to your netflow server on port 12345 on host 10.100.5.2:  precode# cat hostname.pflow0 flowsrc 10.100.5.1 flowdst 10.100.5.2:12345 /code/pre  Just setup a small little OpenBSD machine to handle your internal network routing and that's all there is to it. If you setup a VLAN trunk on an OpenBSD physical interface and tag all associated VLANs on the connected switch port then you're good to go.
