How to open GUI applications on remote machine logged in via SSH on OS X <body> I am logging into a remote Fedora 12 machine via SSH. I have enabled X11 forwarding by passing code-X/code parameter to ssh. I also tried trusted forwarding with code-Y/code. Both of them fail with code(gedit:3711): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display/code, when I try opening a file with gedit on the remote machine.  What am I missing?  <answer193494> Try running a local X11 application first. If that doesn't work, reinstall Xquartz and log out and back in again.
