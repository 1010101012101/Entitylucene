restoring ipod touch forces update <body> I have been trying to restore my 5th Generation Ipod touch from a backup which is stored on my computer. The restore process works fine, however after its' completion there is a white screen lock with a strongSLIDE TO UPGRADE/strong option that prevents me from using the Ipod, unless I upgrade.    Since I do not wish to upgrade the software on the Ipod from the currently installed iOS version (9.2.1), is there some way to circumvent this lockout by Apple?  <answer232030> The "slide to upgrade" screen doesn't update your iOS firmware; it simply prepares your backup for iOS 9.  <comment283388> No, you cannot do anything about it. <comment283427> Really ? ! my device is useless on 9.3 <comment283443> Sorry, I misunderstood your question. <comment283447> I've asked my own question to be able to answer yours: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/232031/what-does-slide-to-upgrade-do <comment283449> thanks for elaborating the issue. I am curious to see what answers come of this question. <comment305428> I have discovered what happens during the "upgrade." See my answer for a link to a post with more information. <comment341192> Did I answer your question well enough? Let me know if I need to add anything.
