Different partition configuration between gpt and fdisk <body> After resizing my HFS partition (to solve a case sensitive/insensitive problem) I found out my BOOTCAMP partition was no longer accessible. As I navigate the web, I found out this is a common issue and there are several pages describing possible solutions.  Most of them begin by asking the user to analyse the output from the following commands:  sudo gpt -r -vv show disk0  precodegpt show: disk0: mediasize=750156374016; sectorsize=512; blocks=1465149168 gpt show: disk0: PMBR at sector 0 gpt show: disk0: Pri GPT at sector 1 gpt show: disk0: Sec GPT at sector 1465149167        start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34           6           40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       409640  1063995800      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1064405440     1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1065674976     1269536      4  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1066944512   398202880      5  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7   1465147392        1743   1465149135          32         Sec GPT table   1465149167           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  sudo fdisk /dev/disk0  precodeDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 91201/255/63 [1465149168 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 - 1465149167] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused  3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused  4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused /code/pre  diskutil list  precodedev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            544.8 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                 Apple_Boot                         650.0 MB   disk0s4    5:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                203.9 GB   disk0s5 /code/pre  My question is, how can fdisk and gpt show different partition  configurations?  Also do you think my BOOTCAMP partition is recoverable?  My laptop is an early 2011 Macbook Pro (quad i7) running El Capitan and Windows 10 64bit in bootcamp (upgraded from windows 7).  The procedure that led to this state was:  ol liResize Macintosh HFS+ partition to half its size/li liCreated a new HFS+ non case sensitive partition between the original and bootcamp./li liMirrored the original partition to the new one./li liFormatted the original partition case insensitive./li liMirrored the new partition to the original one./li liDeleted the new partition./li liResized the original HFS partition to occupy the whole space./li /ol  Thanks in advance for your help.  <answer230668> h2Update 1/h2  This step will involve configuring Master Boot Record (MBR) of your physical internal drive. The MBR is stored on the first 512 bytes of this drive. This space is shared by boot code and the MBR partition table.      strongThis step can not be preformed under OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) with System Integrity Protection (SIP) turn on./strong (This is the default setting.) If you are using OS X 10.11, you must disable SIP, complete this step, then restore SIP. See the link: How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless” on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?.   In a Terminal application window, enter the following commands. The first codefdisk/code command flags the Windows partition as the active partition. The second codefdisk/code command changes the Windows partition id to 7.  precodeINPUT=$(printf  "f  4\nq\ny") sudo  fdisk  -e  /dev/disk0  &lt;&lt;&lt;"$INPUT"  &amp;&gt;/dev/null INPUT=$(printf  "s  4\n7\nq\ny") sudo  fdisk  -e  /dev/disk0  &lt;&lt;&lt;"$INPUT"  &amp;&gt;/dev/null /code/pre  You may need to restart your computer after completing this step.  h2Original Answer/h2  The command codefdisk/code displays the contents of the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. This table can only contain 4 entries and is stored at address 0 of your disk. The command codegpt/code displays the contents of the GUID partition table (GPT). This table can contain 120 entries and starts at address 1 of your disk. (A backup GPT is also stored at the end of the disk.) Legacy systems use a MBR scheme while more modern computers use a GPT scheme. Normally, OS X uses a GPT scheme. When the GPT is employed, the MBR table still exists, but is now called a Protective Master Boot Record (PMBR) table. This PMBR table contains a single entry with ID of codeEE/code. This fools any legacy applications, that only use a MBR scheme, into seeing the disk as occupied by a single partition.  Older Mac computers install Windows using the MBR scheme. It is my understanding this is also a requirement for Windows 7 installations. To accommodate both schemes simultaneously, Apple shrinks the codeEE/code partition in the MBR table to end at the same location as the first partition in the GPT. Usually, the next three partitions in the GPT match the last three partitions in the MBR table.   Anyway, as far as I can tell, if you enter the command given below in a Terminal application windows, your partitions should be fixed.  precodesudo diskutil eraseVolume "Free Space" name /dev/disk0s4 /code/pre  While the above command should fix the partitioning, the 4th partition in the MBR partition table will not be marked as "active". So if you still can not boot to Windows, let me know and I will include steps to mark this partition as "active".  <comment281411> It would help if you could edit your question to include the model/year of your Mac. Also, add which version of Windows you have installed. <comment281676> You're right I remembered that I couldn't so i reformatted the original and recopied my backup over to the original (now case insensitive) and deleted the middle one. I will edit my post. <comment281685> Thanks. That partially solved the issue. I can boot via reFit only as the drive doesn't appear on the standard boot menu. Is it possible to make it available in this menu?
