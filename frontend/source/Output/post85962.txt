In OS X Server.app, what's the number in the app icon? <body> I have Server.app on 10.7, and when I start it, I get the neverending beachball, and in the Dock, the Server.app's icon has a red number in it, which is continuously increasing.  What's the number mean?  <answer85974> It means the number of alerts you have. There are several things that can prompt it to show alerts in Server.app, such as software updates available for the server, a volume unplugged unexpectedly, etc.
