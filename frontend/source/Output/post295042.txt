exclude a word from Apple built-in macOS Spellchecker <body> I'd like to have some valid words actually marked as misspelled by the system for my usage. Example:     wont   Is there a syntax for exclusion in code~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary/code? I tried with no success:  precode!wont -wont /code/pre  Or is it possible to find and duplicate the embedded US dictionary, then alter the copy and use it for spelling?  The end goal is for spellchecking in Chrome.  <comment372385> note: this question is different from https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114347/removing-a-word-from-the-spellcheck-dictionary as [_wont_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wont) is actually an existing word in US English. <comment372411> What's wrong with right-click/Learn ? Wont, because of its rarity will usually offer won't as a replacement, but my system will accept it once I tell it I really did mean wont. <comment372412> @Tetsujin I want the absolute opposite: by default, _wont_ is accepted, despite being rare (in US dictionary). I want my system do reject it. It's not present in LocalDictionary, and `Learn` is the opposite of the desired effect. <comment372414> ah, sorry - I read it the other way round. Not enough coffee yet :/ <comment372422> Not directly what I wanted, but I found that [grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en) will directly highlight _wont_ as a mistake.
