Why does setting CLICOLOR=1 not turn on colors for "ls"? <body> If I do codels -G/code, I emdo/em get the colors. From what I understood from the man pages, if I go into code~/.bash_profile/code and add codeexport CLICOLOR=1/code I would then get colors by doing just codels/code, as "This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR in the environment."   Am I understanding this wrong? Because it's not working for me on Yosemite 10.10.5 in bash with homebrew coreutils(not sure how much of that is relevant). I tried adding this in code~./bashrc/code but same thing. I could always just alias my ls to ls -G, but I want to do this the "right" way. I also tried adding codeexport LSCOLORS=.../code but it didn't help either. Like I said I emdo/em get colors with code-G/code, but I'd like to get them by default by just typing codels/code and not having to set an alias for it, unless my understanding of how this works is wrong.  <comment262055> If you set the variable manually in your active shell, does ls have colors? It's possible your bash_profile is either not being sourced, or being overwritten for some reason <comment262080> What happens if you run `CLICOLOR=1 \ls ~` (the `\` is intentional)? <comment262081> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125060/terminal-not-displaying-colors-for-directory-listings?rq=1 as well
