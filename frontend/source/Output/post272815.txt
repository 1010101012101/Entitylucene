How to complete remove all links to default PHP version? <body> Running macOS Sierra.  How can I complete remove all links to the default installed PHP version? I have installed PHP 7 through homebrew but when I run scripts that call external CLI applications programatically they still seem to end up using PHP 5.6.25 which is the default installed PHP version.  What can I do to break all ties to this PHP version?  My codephp -v/code and codephpinfo()/code already show the proper PHP7 version that I installed. Somehow some scripts still try to look for the default version.  I already read you cannot simply delete it.  If you need more info please let me know.  <answer272817> Try this:  precodesudo mv /usr/bin/php /usr/bin/php5 sudo ln -s `which php` /usr/bin/php /code/pre  The first command backs up the old PHP binary. It can still be used by invoking codephp5/code in a command line. The second command symlinks the new PHP 7 binary to the location of the old PHP binary. Therefore, scripts that use the old location will start using the new PHP version.
