Dreamweaver CC (2015) Will Not Open in El Capitan 10.11.6 <body> Since I upgrading to El Capitan, Dreamweaver CC (2015) will not open in my main (Administrative Level) account. I can, however, open it from a root account.   Adobe claims it is a problem with the data files and is therefore Apple's fault. I suspect Apple disagrees.   I tried the solution here, which involves doing a clear re-install of Adobe products, to no effect.   One of the threads in the that link suggests creating a new user account. I would like to avoid this if possible.  Any other suggestions? Thanks in advance.
