I wanted to mute sound while I open lid of mac book permanently without third party app and without pressing mute button at logoff? <body> I have issue with the login sound every time I open mac-book pro lid. I don't want to use third party app. Muting before logoff helps but its quite hard to remember every time to mute before logoff. Is there some other way to get rid of this permanently?   <comment345175> I don't get any sound at login - do you mean the startup chime when you boot up the computer?
