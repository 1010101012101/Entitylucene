Small Circle Beside Check Box When Syncing Music To IPod 5th Gen <body> I have tried to sync about 15 songs to my iPod since I updated my iTunes and every song has just shown up on my iPod's music list on the computer slightly greyed, and a small circle symbol appeared to the left of the check box on each of the songs.   How do I get these songs to Sync to my iPod?   I already have my iPod on manually manage music.  <comment94360> The circle looks ok from here.
