Smart mailbox filter with regex <body> I want to use regex for filtering the specific mail recipients. But it seems not to support this function. How to make it work? My purpose is to filter for instances such as sales01, sales02, sales03 and lots of derivatives.  <comment366503> Have you considered a rule that runs an AppleScript? (Assuming you are referring to Mail on a Mac.  What version of macOS?) <comment366504> I heard it. But, I have no ideas about how to put these mails to a specific mail box such as "sales member mail". Would you like to share some guides? Thanks. <comment366857> @bjbk macOS 10.12.5 Sierra. Would you recommend some tutorial channels, books, app or websites about AppleScript?
