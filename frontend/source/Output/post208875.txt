How can I change a command and cursor key bindings globally? <body> I want to assign "Go to previous word" command to kbdcmd/kbdkbd←/kbd and "Go to beginning of the line" command to kbdalt/kbdkbd←/kbd.  In short, I want to switch the actions of kbdcmd/kbdkbd←/kbd and kbdalt/kbdkbd←/kbd. Similarly for kbdcmd/kbdkbd→/kbd and kbdalt/kbdkbd→/kbd as well. How can I accomplish this?  <answer208877> To swap the key bindings download, install and start Karabiner.  Open the menulet Karabiner - Preferences... in the menubar, search for emarrow/em and enable the swapping of the two command like in the example below (FYI KeyRemap4MacBook shown in the screenshot is the predecessor of Karabiner):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtH6W.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment251858> By the way, this will change the behaviour for all text fields I will be editing. Is that right? <comment251859> @Utku Not necessarily. If an editor uses a completely different shortcut it might fail. But I have tested it in several editors or browsers and it worked for all of them. <comment251915> What shell emulator? Terminal? iTerm? <comment251916> @willWorkForCookies I didn't quite understand what you mean. I want this behaviour to occur in every text field. <comment251917> My bad; those are shortcuts frequently used in terminal so I made a poor assumption. <comment251918> @willWorkForCookies Actually this question did not solve my issue. I have written [another one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208904/how-to-change-a-key-combination-without-using-karabiner). I would be grateful if you have time to check it out.
