iOS App stuck in 'Loading...' <body> I tried downloading Tumblr yesterday but it never completed. At the moment I have an App icon stuck at 'Loading...'.  I have tried restarting the iPhone (holding down both home and side buttons at the same time) and I have also tried shutting down the iPhone (holding the side button and swiping).  I have also tried deleting it as usual (holding the icon down and choosing delete but it doesn't go away).  Any ideas on what I can do to get rid of this icon?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MJy31.jpg" width="375"  <answer188950> Go to strongSettings/strong → strongGeneral/strong → strongStorage &amp; iCloud Usage/strong → strongManage Storage/strong, select the app from the list, then tap strongDelete App/strong.  <answer188958> Certain apps might be frozen with a blank icon and their will be no way of removing them for days. By holding down on the home screen to delete the stuck app also won't work..    Here are instructions on how to delete these waiting applications:  ol liReboot your iPhone normally. See this link for instructions on how to restart your iPhone./li liIf the apps are still stuck on the home screen, try logging out of the App Store temporarily. Navigate to Settings - Store - Apple ID - Sign Out. Now open the App Store and Navigate to the Featured section. Scroll to the bottom of the page and touch the Sign In - Use Existing Apple ID. Log in and the stuck apps should reset./li liStill have strange icons on the screen or frozen downloading apps? Connect your iPhone to the computer and open iTunes. Navigate to the app store. Install the apps you are having a problem with on the computer then sync your iPhone./li /ol  <answer250813> Don't want to connect to iTunes or delete and re-install the app (along with all the settings you may have customized?) Try this:  ol liIf the app update got stuck at Loading... because of insufficient space free some: Settings... General... Storage &amp; iCloud Usage... Storage: Manage Storage. Find a hog; either delete the app entirely or go into that app and manage its internal storage. (I find podcasts consume a lot and I will delete downloaded media files to free up space; or I will delete immediately (not just in 30 days) some unneeded pictures.) /li liReboot the iPhone /li liGo into App Store, re-select Update All. It will appear as though you are stuck again./li liTouch the update circle of the app that is stuck; the circle will switch back to the Update button.  /li liSelect Update button and now the app update should complete./li /ol  <comment223745> have you tried connecting it to itunes and deleting the app in there? <comment223761> is it in the app list in the general settings? general settings  usage? <comment223775> @Gabkano Yes. I've just deleted it through that menu and it has disappeared now. Thanks. <comment265625> It's now Settings  General  Storage & iCloud Usage  Manage Storage.
