The multi-touch functionality from my Magic Mouse is frustrating with Google Calendar. Can I disable it? <body> ...The tiniest swipe left or right changes the month. It makes using my calendar sooooo frustrating. Can I disable it? I would like to disable side-swiping in general. It mostly causes me frustration.  Is there a way?  <comment238592> just fixed it by installing MagicPrefs ... but still interested in answers. Especially, if it helps somebody else that is searching for the answer. <comment238593> 1. Install Magic Prefs  2. Click link to 'Configure Scrolling' below picture of mouse 3. Un-check 'Horizonal Scrolling' for single swipe <comment238600> "Can I disable it?" Yes! You can definitely disable Google Calendar! <comment238757> ha @AlanShutko what is your favorite desktop calendar app (needs to sync with google calendar) <comment238791> I just don't use google calendar at all.  But I do like Fantastical 2, and it will sync with Google Calendar.
