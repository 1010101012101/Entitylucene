How can I stream all audio from my imac into a PC on the same network? <body> I would like all iMac sounds to go through my network into my PC speakers. Is there an available solution for this?  <answer31018> Should be possible with AirFoil, but I've only personally used it to send audio between two Macs. They have a Windows version as well, though.  <comment35612> Yes. This is a good idea. <comment35737> Ditto! AirFoil is great.
