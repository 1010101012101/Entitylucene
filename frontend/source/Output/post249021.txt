Unmountable HDD - Can I save the data? <body> I have an iMac, and the internal HDD is failing.  My files are still there, and I'm able to login, but it freezes when I try to do anything.  I attempted to use asr in terminal to copy the entire Macintosh HD folder to an external HDD, but emfacepalm/em set the target as the WRONG HDD.  When I hit enter, asr went through it's normal steps, and then hit PSTT 0  100 start restore and hung there for longer than I expected it to.  Then I realized that I put the wrong target volume, and terminated the window.    Now, when I try to plug the HDD into my laptop, it doesn't mount.  I can see it in Disk Utility and can run repair on it, but get the following:   "Problems were found with the partition map, that may prevent booting"  Trying to mount it in the terminal fails too.    I have Disk Warrior, and it can see the HDD (and even shows the name I set for it, whereas Disk Utility shows it as Untitled) but it says the drive is too big.  I have Drive Genius, but it shows up under devices and not volumes, so I can't repair it there either.    Can anyone help me fix the map?

Disk Drill categorized the found files by type - video/pictures/audio/etc and dumped all file name info - they're now file 000001.jpg etc.  So I've lost file names and folder structure.  I'm so grateful and happy to be able to have my files back, now hoping there's a way to get my structure/names back on the old drive...  Any ideas?   Thank you!  <answer249174> I figured it out and I'm leaving my solution here in case someone else has the same issue:   I bought Disk Drill ($90 for the Pro version). Had it go through all recovery options for the drive (took 6 hours for a 3TB drive), which resulted in a list of files, organized by file type and without file info.    For example, all of my JPGs were in one folder, with names like file00001.jpg, file00002.jpg, etc.  I saved the session, went back, and had it search for lost HFS partitions and strongall my folders and file names/strong are back.  strongUPDATE/strong I started transferring my files over to a new drive, and unfortunately none of them are readable.  All of them throw an error that says the file is either empty, or damaged/corrupted.  Taking a couple steps back and transferring over the deep scan files instead - the unnamed/sorted-by-file-type versions.  Although those don't have any organizational data, they are not damaged.    Any ideas of how I can recover my files WITH information intact would be much appreciated...  Or a way to salvage the map of the original drive.  <comment308746> I suppose if there is something wrong with the partition map, you should attempt to print out the values in the tables. To to do so you will need to execute the following commands. `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk1` These commands will not change your drive. If the commands will not execute, then let me know and I will instruct you on how to do a hex dump of the table values. <comment308749> Hi!  Thank you for your help - I read through an answer that you helped someone else with, but unfortunately we didn't have the same problem...  So happy to see you here!!! <comment308754> Yes, I need to be able to get it off and onto a new drive <comment308755> @Lauren If I understand your question correctly, you have one internal faulty drive and at least two external drives. You wanted to asr to the empty external drive1 but targeted the also attached data drive 2 instead? What is the size of the internal iMac drive? Do you remember the complete `asr ...` command? <comment308757> Correct! iMac drive is 1TB, wanted to copy to a 2TB ext, but accidentally copied to 3TB ext that had all of my files on it.  The coast command was --noverify --erase --verbose --source source --target target.  It only got the the PSTT 0 100 start restore step, but just hung there.  Then I looked over the commands I sent, realized my error, and quit the window. I hope the files are still there, and that I just can't mount it because the map is trashed.  I hope that if it really was erased, I wouldn't be able to see the drive name in Disk Warrior <comment308759> The asr command** <comment308993> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1` (the recovered disk) to this **answer**! Be sure the 3 TB drive is the only attached external drive or the disk identifier (/dev/diskX with X = 1, 2, etc.) may be different <comment309230> @klanomath Here is the info requested: `start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2          4         Pri GPT table           6      76800      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       76806  732331114      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   732407920     158720      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   732566640          4         Sec GPT table   732566644          1         Sec GPT header`
