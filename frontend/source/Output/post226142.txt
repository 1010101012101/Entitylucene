How to control where script run by cron saves files? <body> I've got the following cron job that runs at 6 am every morning:  precode00 6 * * * /Users/username/path/to/script/wget.pl 1; /code/pre  The script, written in perl, fetches the latest files from a website.  Within the perl script, the path gets changed with:  precode`cd '/path/to/directory'` /code/pre  However, all the files downloaded aren't getting saved to code/path/to/directory/code they get saved in code/Users/username/code.  What can I do to get the script to save it in the directory I want?  <answer226143> Doing a `cd /path` within your script only changes the directory for the shell that is spawned to execute the shell command.  It's the same thing as doing   precodesystem('cd /path'); /code/pre  It doesn't change the cwd (current working directory) of the script itself.  The best way to do it is to have your script write the files to a specific directory.  If your perl script is a straight wrapper for wget, you can do away with the perl script and do something along the lines of:  precodewget -O /full/path/to/file http://host/url/here /code/pre  If you want to do this within perl (example idea, not tested)...  precodeuse LWP::Simple qw(get); my $url = 'http://host/url/here'; my $result = get $url; open(my $fh, "&gt;", "/path/to/file"); print $fh $result; close($fh) /code/pre  One final option (again not tested)...  precode00 6 * * * cd /path/you/want;/Users/username/path/to/script/wget.pl 1; /code/pre  <comment274584> Ok, I ended up using the --directory-prefix option for wget to get this to work.
