Keynote and presenter note fonts <body> Is there a way to tell Keynote to change the font for all the presenter notes in this file to a specific font? I find that sometimes it screws up the fonts for the notes (not the body) of a bunch of the slides, and it is tedious to change them one-by-one.  <answer35450> Seems you can edit the XML if you're really stuck:   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2626026?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer84261> I was having a similar problem where the presenter notes would change size radically for no apparent, making them unreadable. After checking on a lot of the boards, including Apple's, I tripped across an idea by someone (don't remember who now). I tried it and it worked great. Quit Keynote, launch Disk Utility, select your hard drive from the list on the left and then select: strongRepair Disk Permissions!/strong Quit DU, relaunch Keynote and your presenter notes will (hopefully) fine. Good luck!  <comment37035> Which version of Keynote? <comment40992> Highly recommended making a  backup. Quote from linked page: «Right click your presentation and select +Show Package Content+, you will see a file titled index.apxl.gz. Double click this to unzip giving you a new file index.apxl. Trash the index.apxl.gz and open index.apxl in text edit. Then search for slideNote. Change the part with sf:fontNamesf:string sfa:string="Font-Name-of-your-font"//sf:fontNamesf:fontColorsf:color xsi:type="sfa:calibrated-rgb-color-type" sfa:r="0" sfa:g="0" sfa:b="0" sfa:a="1"//sf:fontColorsf:fontSizesf:number sfa:number=“18” sfa:type="f"//sf:fontSize <comment132584> I have the same need for Keynote '09.
