"Specks" on photos - possible to repair? <body> I have several specks on the photos from my iPhone 5 64GB:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jeVYD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  and here zoomed in  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLnak.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  These are emnot/em on the lens as they are not blurred, so I assume they are on the sensor or faulty pixels on the sensor.  My question is if this is a repairable for a price which makes sense for an iPhone 5 64 GB. Any experiences?  <answer245590> As far as iPhone replacement parts go, the usually the only ones that cost more than a few dollars are the digitizer assembly (touchscreen), logic board, battery, and (for the iPhone 5 and later) the rear case of the iPhone. Cameras usual cost less than $5.  Replacing the camera in the iPhone 5 is more complicated than it needs to be, but definitely possible. Here's the iFixit guide.
