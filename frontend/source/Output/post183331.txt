iPhone 5 Problem with recording on my calender <body> The problem is that I cannot put items on my Calender beyond the date of 29 April 2017... Why can not go to farther years which appear in the calendar   <comment218506> as far I know it is not the Armageddon day :) <comment218513> is it an iCloud calendar, or some other, Google, CalDAV, etc? I have no issue entering dates in 2018 on iCloud, not tested further
