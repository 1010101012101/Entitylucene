Sign out of YouTube on iPhone video app uploader <body> I uploaded a video to my YouTube account from a friend's iPhone.  Now I want to to sign out so that he can upload videos from his own account, but it's no longer prompting to login to a YouTube account or giving an option to log out, it's just leaving my account signed in.  Help?  Thanks.  <answer30300> If you did it from the Camera Roll, I think you should go into the actual Youtube app on the phone and have him sign in with his/her account now, and I think that should fix it. Either that or what Iskra said  <answer30371> ul liStart the YouTube app on the iPhone/li liSelect ".../More" at the bottom right/li liSelect "Sign out" at the top left/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvZET.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer92416> Go to settings and you should be able to find a log out option   <answer99262> Youtube has changed recently. Now you have to go to codeSettings &gt; Sign out/code.  To get to codeSettings/code, look in the upper left corner and hit the button that has 3 lines on top of each other (like this = but with 3 lines). If that button is not there, hit the back arrow enough times until it shows up.  Once you click that button you'll see codeSettings/code on the left pane.  Click it, then on the next screen click codeSign Out/code.  I have no idea why Youtube is making it so hard to sign out but, now you know how.  <answer101588> That didn't work for me, that option wasn't visible on the app. Instead, I started the process of uploading a video again from camera roll then when in the upload window before you take it to next stage I scrolled down to where it says user account ( my email or user name), touch screened that and there was an option to sign out popped up :D  <answer138976> If you've upgraded to 7+ OS you can sign out in the share screen when you are in camera roll  click on a video to share  click on youtube  scroll down to the bottom  click on your account username  click on option to log out.  <answer215680> I just deleted the app then redownloaded it  <comment108403> Could you elaborate on where in settings this lies? The leading answer shows it in the â€¦ More tab of the app as opposed to settings.
