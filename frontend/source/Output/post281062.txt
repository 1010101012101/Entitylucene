MacBook Pro (13 inch, early 2015) crashing after use of Dual External Monitor <body> recently I have had a rather odd issue concerning the MacBook Pro 13 inch (early 2015) where it would crash after being unused for periods of 60-80 min when connected with a DisplayPort Cable to an external 4K display. It was plugged in every instance where it would crash. Additionally, when I disconnected the DisplayPort Cable and opened up the MacBook to use its normal display, it showed a black screen. However, the trackpad appeared the show functionality, but using the screen and keyboard brightness buttons yielded no responses.   Any ideas as to why?   <answer281223> I am having similar issue on strongiMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)/strong, see: Displays randomly remain blank when waking up  An engineer was assigned to my case in Apple Support. I recommend getting support from Apple too.  <comment353632> Welcome to Ask Different! :) Have you tried testing the MBP in [Safe Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262) to see if the problem still occurs? Also, can you edit your question (there's an _edit_ link below it) to clarify how you're using your MBP? For example, your question title refers to _Dual External Monitor_ but your question doesn't expand on this. Are you just using the one external display, or two? It may also be worth including the exact model of your display(s).
