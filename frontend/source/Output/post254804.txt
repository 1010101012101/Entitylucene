Keyboard shortcut for locking screen in macOS Sierra? <body> In previous versions of OSX, I could use kbdCtrl/kbd kbdShift /kbd kbdPower/kbd on my built in keyboard, or kbdCtrl/kbd kbdShift /kbd kbdEject/kbd on my (old) Apple bluetooth keyboard to lock the screen.   After upgrading to Sierra, that shortcut stopped working. Using emKarabiner-EventViewer/em I discovered that pressing the built in power button triggers codeSysKey 0x6/code, and the Bluetooth keyboard kbdEject/kbd triggers no events.   Whats going on, and how can re-enable that shortcut?  <answer256236> Apple removed has removed this shortcut for security purposes &amp; due to issues with bluetooth connectivity.br /br /You can utilize strongHot Corners/strong as a work-around.br /br /emSystem PreferencesDesktop &amp; Screen Saver/emimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Gab7.png" alt="enter image description here"br /br /You get to choose what hot keys trigger the actionbr /When I hold down kbdCommand/kbd and drag my mouse to top left corner, my computer locks it's screen.  <answer256738> Hold down the power button for about a half second. This will sleep the computer. If you have it set to lock when the computer sleeps, you're good to go. However, if you hold it down too long, it will ask to restart the computer.  Edit: As ingenious stated, some keyboards do not have a power button. In that case, attempt to locate a sleep button or try another method.  img src="https://www.andrels.com/wp-en_US/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/7010941r_03.jpg" alt="Sleep button"  <answer256747> There are different ways how do you lock your screen  strong1. Use keychain/strong  Open keychain - Settings choose from there strongShow keychain status in menu bar/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F3TLD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You can now choose from the menu bar to lock your screen.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oji4B.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  With this Option you need next time your password to log in.  strong2. Use Hot Corners for lock your screen/strong  At first go to your System Settings - Desktop &amp; Screen Safer and choose on the bottom right Hot Corners   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uLc46.png" alt="enter image description here"  Next choose one of the corners the Option strongPut Display to sleep/strong, I prefer bottom right, but this is by each user different.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgLFL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Thats all, one note: You can use in the Privacy Settings when the display will be locked. For example, if you have set to five minutes, you need to enter your password not before the time in your setting ist gone. You can change this to immediately for example.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQEk4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer258388> You can setup a keyboard shortcut of your choice by creating a strongService/strong using strongAutomator/strong.  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong (kbdCmd ⌘/kbdkbdSpace/kbd then enter codeAutomator/code)./li liCreate a new strongService/strong./li liIn the left pane, pick strongUtilities/strong → strongRun Shell Script/strong (or use the search field), and drag it into the strongActions/strong pane (the right one)./li liJust above that action, select emService receives strongno input/strong in strongAny Application/em/strong./li liEnter code"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession" -suspend/code as the text of your shell script (be sure to include the quotes)./li listrongSave/strong your service and give it a name./li liOpen strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongShortcuts/strong → strongServices/strong → strongGeneral/strong (at the very bottom of the list)./li liMake sure the service you’ve just created is checked/enabled./li liClick emnone/em to assign a keyboard shortcut to it./li /ol  Now try your keyboard shortcut. You'll be kicked to the login screen. It might appear as though this logs you out, but it does not.  The service is also accessible from the strongMenu Bar/strong → strongApplication Name/strong → strongServices/strong. I think the very first time I set it up, I actually had to click it from there before the keyboard shortcut worked, but that might have been a fluke.  If you prefer to sleep your display instead of locking the screen, use codepmset displaysleepnow/code as the shell script. This will put your display to sleep, though in that case your screen will only lock after the set timeout specified under strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongSecurity/strong → strongGeneral/strong. You could even go crazy and setup both services.  <answer267461> You could use Hammerspoon and define a key binding/shortcut. I use   precodehs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "alt"}, "S", function()       hs.caffeinate.startScreensaver() end) /code/pre  in my code~/.hammerspoon/init.lua/code sequence to bind  kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdS/kbd to the screen saver; that I have set to "Require a password codeimmediately/code after sleep or screen saver begins" in strongSystem Preferences → Security &amp; Privacy/strong. You can also use  precodehs.caffeinate.lockScreen()  /code/pre  but I prefer the screen saver approach. See the Hammerspoon docs for all the automation magic it enables.  <answer273836> You can put your mac to sleep with kbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdoption/kbd + kbd⌽⏻/kbd.

It's under System Preferences/Keyboard and use the "Customize Control Strip…" button.  <answer278563> I am currently using a MacBook Pro that's running MacOS Sierra, version 10.12.4. Coming from a Windows and Ubuntu background, I found it odd that a Mac doesn't have an easy shortcut for locking the computer. However, what worked for me are these steps:  ol liGo to codeSystem Preferences &gt;&gt; Security &amp; Privacy/code./li liChoose the codeGeneral/code tab./li liSet your Mac to require a password strongimmediately/strong the screensaver starts or your computer wakes from sleep./li liFinally, whenever you want to lock your computer, just press the key combination of codeCtrl + Shift + Power button/code./li /ol  <answer294256> In macOS High Sierra (10.13) there is a 'Lock Screen' option built in the Apple menu.   And finally a shortcut kbdctrl/kbd + kbdcmd/kbd + kbdQ/kbd :-)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mwBfx.png" alt="Lock Screen in Apple Menu"  <comment318393> How do you feel about shareware utilities? <comment318414> I had a similar problem with MacBook Pro (that has eject key on built-in keyboard) and a wired Apple keyboard. External keyboard's ctrl+shift+eject didn't do anything. Then I tried the same shortcut with the built-in keyboard, which worked—and, to my surprise, *after this* the shortcut worked also with the external keyboard! (Also I noted I had to hold the shortcut about 0,5 seconds longer than before.) Have you tried this? If it works, I can submit this as an answer… <comment319596> Just tried to press Ctrl + Shift + Power on built-in keyboard of my MBL15 and it locked the screen. However, I used to a shorter shortcut :) - Hot Corner: quickly put mouse cursor to down right corner (you can choose to your taste) and screen locks. <comment320303> Can you please clarify something? Is this only for Bluetooth keyboards? For example, if I upgrade my MBP and do Control+Shift+Eject on the wired or built-in keyboards, would that lock the screen, and would Control+Option+Command+Eject on those keyboards shut it down? Also, would that second keyboard shortcut work over a Bluetooth keyboard? Also can you confirm if any duration is needed to hold those keys to perform either shortcut? Personally I don't use the Control+Shift+Eject shortcut often, but I always use Control+Option+Command+Eject and this question and this answer has me worried. <comment322321> there is no power button on the external (usb/bluetooth) apple keyboards. <comment341183> If you're a developer who is already using a shell, you can skip the whole Automator thing:        osx_logout() {       "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession" -suspend     } <comment356156> Thank you; I couldn't find this anywhere else and it's so much easier than the alternatives! <comment359652> @WuTheFWasThat although, since it doesn't actually log you out, I wouldn't call it 'osx_logout'... :) <comment359653> If it doesn't work and you use a non-standard shell (e.g. zsh) it might help to set the shell for the script explicitly to /bin/bash in automator. At least it did in my case. <comment361198> How to open that keychain? <comment362788> Type in Spotlight **keychain** and hit Enter. Or choose from the Finder-Menu - Go To - **Utilities** and open from there keychain. <comment362811> There's a `Keychain Access`.... <comment362818> It's not clear what do you mean.
