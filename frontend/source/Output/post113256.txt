iPhone 4 cannot be charged via power supply after iOS 7 update <body> Using an iPhone 4 and a original power supply (a1357) + cable (usb) i am not able to charge the phone.  However connecting my phone to the pc (windows) it will be recognized and charge.  This behaviour occured after i updated to iOS 7.  I tried using another cable and another power supply (the 2nd is not original but certified for apple products).  I tried setting reduce movement to on because it was suggested in an apple forum. This did not help.  <answer113286> This sounds like a problem with your power supply that just happened to coincide with iOS 7. "Reduce motion" setting will not make a difference. If it's under warranty, take it into the Apple Store and see if you can get it replaced. Otherwise, you may need to buy a new charger.  If you are good with electronics, you can cut open a USB cable, plug it into the charger, and see if the voltages between D+, D-, and Vbus match this pinout.  <comment132927> Have you tried a cold start of your iPhone?
