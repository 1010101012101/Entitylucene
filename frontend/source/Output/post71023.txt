What can be done when Finder crashes constantly? <body> Finder has started to strongcrash constantly/strong such that I can't click the icon in Dock. I strongcan't click Apple/strong in top-left corner of the screan (Finder also crash), I strongdon't have any menubar icons from Apple/strong like a Time Machine, Spotlight and the system is unstable. Safari crashes but what is confusing Google Chrome, Sparrow and other strong3rd party apps works as normal/strong. Only Apple menubar app that is working is Notification Center.  I tryied to start with strongsafe mode/strong but it failed to launch. I have turned strongverbose/strong launch screen on before (it look more cool) so now I can see few error messages on start and after that information that my Mac passes some tests for a brief moment. Login in looks and works normal.  What is possible source of problem and how do I can fix that?  I have MacBook Pro Late 2011 with Mac OS Mountain Lion 10.8.2.  <answer94657> Only solution was complete clean reinstall of the system.  <comment82491> What's in your console log? <comment82499> Have you tried creating a brand new account and using that? <comment82510> Have you tried disabling kernel extensions or launchd services? You can print a list of them with [Consultant's Canary](http://khiltd.com/software/consultants_canary). <comment82543> @stuffe when I want to open my Console it crashes :( here is Console crash report - http://pastebin.com/HqcQ14CW <comment82545> @lhf I can't enter my system preferences becouse it crashes - crash report http://pastebin.com/3EW9Twsn <comment82546> @LauriRanta well... it escalated quickly!
