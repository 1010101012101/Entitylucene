Mac magic keyboard F keys not working <body> After updating Yosemite on an iMac 2011 for some reason my F keys on my magic keyboard stopped working.  When I researched the only question I was able to find was "Function keys Magic Keyboard not bound correctly" but that is for Mavericks.    I've gone into settings and tried codeChange Keyboard Type../code but that hasn't changed the beeping behavior when I click an F key.  I've tried both wired and wireless connections and I've removed the keyboard from the Bluetooth.  When searching I found Why are my top-row keyboard buttons not working on Mac Lion? but I dont have all those options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2FLms.png" alt="enter image description here"  Diving deeper I found Top row of keyboard isn't working so I unplugged my iMac and let it sit for an hour.  Logged in and re-connected the keyboard and the same issue occurs.  strongMac system specs:/strong  ul liOS: Yosemite/li liVersion: 10.10.5/li liiMac 27-inch, Mid 2011/li /ul  App Store says no more updates available. How can I get my F keys back?
