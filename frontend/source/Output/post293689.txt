Haptic feedback gone from Pages and Keynote <body> I've recently experienced a problem with Pages and Keynote.br You know when you drag an image and it gets automatically centred or aligned with some other image and the trackpad "vibrates" when happens? brWell, that feedback has suddenly gone, but the normal "click" and feedback from force touch work regularly.  br I could not find any trackpad settings apart from the "click" intensity, cursor speed and gestures. Nothing inside those programs. br What could it be...? I'm running Sierra 12.5.6 and a MacBook Pro 13" with touchbar.
