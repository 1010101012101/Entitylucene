Why do menu items blink twice when selected? <body> I wanted to know why while clicking on an written item (quit, hide, option...) the item in question blink twice very fast and then do the action we wanted?  Thanks  <answer199909> It is simply a visual cue that you have selected that menu item.  It is described in Apple's official documentation under Menu Behavior OS X Human Interface Guidelines:     When the user chooses a menu item, it blinks briefly to confirm the   user’s choice and then performs the action.   OS X provides other visual cues: when you press a key shortcut, for example kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd, the menu bar menu where that key shortcut is listed, in our example codeEdit/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yN4qz.png" alt="enter image description here"  is highlighted for a fraction of a second.  <comment240755> It may help you get a response if you change the subject to show a summary of what the question is <comment240824> And in older versions of "classic" Mac System Software you could change the number of blinks and/or turn it off. I guess that preference didn't make it thru the transition to OS X. <comment240827> Is there a deeper question here? This is just a design decision that Apple had made it years ago and continues to use presumably because they think it's the best experience for the user. <comment241041> @bmike I don't know if that's the OP's case, but I can imagine that switchers from Windows to OS X may be surprised by or even bothered with visual cues like this. So no, there is no deeper question here, but I think it is still a valid question that expresses curiosity on why this happens. <comment241102> @jaume Cool - I just wanted to be sure we were answering Melvish's issue if it wasn't the one we all assumed was the obvious question. If the OP had added that back story, we could be more sure about their intent. As it reads - there's a bit of guessing that can happen by people trying to answer.
