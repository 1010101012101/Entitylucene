Keys and mouse randomly stop working briefly <body> Since a couple of days, I experience the weird issue that OS X 10.10.3 does not react to keyboard or mouse inputs, except multitouch gestures like 4-finger swipes. The unresponsiveness will persist for ~20 seconds (I haven't counted yet) and then all clicks and key presses I made during that time seem to be executed quickly one after the other, as if they had been buffered somewhere and the buffer had then been flushed.  I have associated this problem with the following log message in Console  precodeIOHIDSystem: postEvent LLEventQueue overflow. /code/pre  Which makes sense as it fits the symptoms. However, I cannot figure out, what exactly triggers this behaviour.   I have an MBP 9,2 with 8GB RAM, a 120GB Samsung EVO SSD as the primary drive and the stock 500GB drive in the optical bay. Both have 30GB free space. Also according to Activity Monitor, the freezes do not coincide with high memory pressure.  I have never had the problem before the recent 10.10.3 update, but I cannot tell if it really relates (since updating, I also have occasional graphics problems, so it may be the update was buggy, it's impossible to tell).  The question is, how can I diagnose the problem exactly or how can I fix it?  emEDIT/em: The preceding log messages seem unremarkable, like this  precode26/04/15 21:12:34,057   lsregister[5417]    LaunchServices: Begin database seeding 26/04/15 21:12:34,057   lsregister[5417]    LaunchServices: Completed database seeding 26/04/15 21:12:52,000   kernel[0]   Google Chrome He (map: 0xffffff80435524b0) triggered DYLD shared region unnest for map: 0xffffff80435524b0, region 0x7fff90a00000-&gt;0x7fff90c00000.

Try looking at console there and if the problem persists, tell me <comment217658> @Allan I have not yet isolated it because it happens so randomly, but I rather think it's independent of the applications running. It often happens when I'm in Chrome, but that might be because I spend most of my time there. <comment217691> @oarfish  Just for grins and giggles, can you try using a different browser (Firefox or Safari, but not Opera) for a little while and see if the problem persists? <comment217725> @Allan Well, we can rule out the browser. Been using FF a while and left Chrome off during that time, and it just happened again. <comment217740> @oarfish Ok..making some progress...A couple more things to try:  Can you reboot in safe mode (hold shift while booting)  This will clear the dyld cache.  Second, can you see if it happens in a native application like TextEdit or Word.  Also, I am curious about that quicklook application.  I am concerned that this application may be causing some issues.  Can you disable/uninstall to see if that fixes the problem? <comment217859> I'll try with safe mode some time; as for Quicklook, you can't disable it, it's part of OSX. <comment217896> Are you mouse and keyboard connected by bluetooth? I found the same issue and this was cause by interference. <comment217897> No, they are built-in and I usually have no other devices connected when the error occurs. <comment218357> Tried with safe mode, it still happens. <comment231446> I've same issue, have you found the solution? <comment231448> @SandroDzneladze No, it still happens multiple times a day, but I'm not blocked for 30 seconds or so. Whenever I notice it, I show the desktop via 4-finger-spread and drag the mouse around until I see the selection rectangle which tells me it's working again. I'm not sure if constant dragging somehow speeds it up, but at least I see immediately when it's gone. I will try to reinstall my OS, but can't do it right now. <comment231496> @oarfish I've macbook pro retina 2014. basically new. It happens for just few secs. The only peripheral I use is bluetooth mouse. For me its just 5 secs each time, but freakin annoying. <comment250634> @SandroDzneladze I have reinstalled OSX (not a clean install, but simply booting to recovery and choosing reinstall, which does not remove any user data), and it still happens. I will try a clean install soon. <comment250682> @oarfish I tried not clean reinstall too, and it still happens. but before doing anything else lets wait for el capitano, maybe it fixes something... <comment251105> Made another admin user and used that for some time. It took a longer time than usual I think, but it did happen again. <comment252055> I erased my hard drive, reinstalled osx and used migration assistant to reinstate everything. It just happened again. I guess the ultimate test would be to erase everything, make a new user and use that for some time to observe. If the bug shows up again, it must be hardware-related. It seems I'll have to live with this.
