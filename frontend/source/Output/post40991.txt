Any suggestions / thoughts?  <answer40997> code[Gmail]/code and its children (codeImportant/code, codeSpam/code, codeStarred/code) are not regular mailboxes (or tags, as internally used by Gmail), they are linked to specific Gmail functionality and therefore cannot be deleted. You can delete tags/mailboxes that you defined.  <answer50234> You should delete the inbox in your settings...  Settings &lt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars  Select your account and hit the delete button. It will completely delete the account from your iPhone, not the GMail servers.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJY0I.png" width="300"  <comment46468> Vlad: Thanks! So, how do I not allow it to sync and remove the emails as such from Mail i.e., I do not want anyone (folks at home) to click on the Mail and read my email. <comment46472> Ignore me. Removed it from Settings.
