Apple says I'm signing an app with old OS version, and I'm not <body> I'm trying to submit a Java-based app to AppStore. After having the worst headaches in my life trying to sign everything my last problem (I hope!) is this:     Invalid code signature - Signatures created with OS X version 10.8.5   or earlier [v1 signatures] are obsoleted and will no longer be   recognized by Gatekeeper beginning with OS X version 10.9.5. To ensure   your apps will run on updated versions of OS X they must be signed on   OS X version 10.9 or later [v2 signatures]. For more information, see   OS X Code Signing In Depth   I don't understand this message because:  1) I'm running a 10.10.1 version  precode$ sw_vers -productVersion  10.10.1 /code/pre  2) and my app is signed with version 2 signatures  precode$ codesign -dv MyApp.app Executable=/Users/jess/git/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaAppLauncher Identifier=com.myapp Format=bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64) CodeDirectory v=20200 size=286 flags=0x0(none) hashes=5+5 location=embedded Signature size=4351 Signed Time=20/2/2015 16:31:42 Info.plist entries=20 TeamIdentifier=D38HW9S49C Sealed Resources version=2 rules=12 files=15 Internal requirements count=1 size=204 /code/pre  (You can see the line saying strongSealed Resources version=2 rules=12 files=15/strong)  So, what is the problem ? What am I missing ?  Thank you  <answer173754> I found it ... I know this answer seems crazy, but it's the solution.  When you bundle the app, the folder emYourApp.app/Contents/PlugIns/jdk1.{your_version}.jdk/Contents//em  dissapears, so you have just to recover it from the JDK home, and the bundle "will looks fine" to Apple.  So:  precodecp -r /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.{your_version}/Contents/MacOS YourApp.app/Contents/PlugIns/jdk{your_version}.jdk/Contents/ /code/pre  And it's working !  Thank you Apple for a message so clear :-P  <comment204471> I would think the real way of making sure that the directory is copied is to make sure it is included in a Copy ... build phase
