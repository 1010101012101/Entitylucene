Some clarifications about Messages.app in Mountain Lion <body> After the update to Mountain Lion I see that I have four accounts in my Messages app (see this question for more information). I am a bit confused about what happened here, namely:  ol liThe code@mac.com/code account has always been used for iChat, but now in the Messages app it looks like it is used for iMessage/li liMy Gmail account was used on my iPhone and iPad (I say "was" because I haven't used iMessage on my mobile devices for a while), but now it looks like it is used for GTalk in the Messages app/li liI have never used Bonjour for message exchange, why does it appear now in the list of accounts?/li /ol  Why have there been such changes? If I leave the situation as it is now, does it mean that I cannot receive iMessages on my Gmail account but only on the code@mac.com/code account?  <answer78807> There are several things going on here. First, and easiest, Bonjour just appears as an option that you can configure if you have a Bonjour account. No need to worry about that.  As for iMessage, you can have more then one email address that other iMessage users can message you at. For example, when I open Messages settings I have a few different accounts in there. Bonjour is disabled, and two Google Talk accounts which I have disabled also. When I click on my "iMessage" account, my iPhone number as well as several email accounts which are linked to my Apple ID show in there. So I have my Gmail (which I use for my Apple ID), my @iCloud.com and @me.com email accounts, as well as two others that I have arbitrarily added in so that other users can text those emails as well.  Messages.app on Mountain Lion can manage multiple types of instant message at one time. For example, I can have a Jabber account, Google Talk account, emand/em my iMessage account all tied into Messages. When someone "pings" any of those accounts, Messages "handles" that and I can reply.
