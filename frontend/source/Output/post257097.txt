Prevent OSX from seeing a disk previously used for Time Machine as a TM disk <body> I have a slightly flakey old disk which was once used with Time Machine on an old mac. Since Time Machine is no longer part of my workflow, I'd like to just access this disk like any other HDD. Currently, when I try to delete files I receive the message "The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified."  Edit: I tried using codetmutil associatedisk/code, but I don't see any old versions when I "Enter Time Machine".  <answer257118> I would just Partition/Erase the disk.  <answer257242> There is a command named codebypass/code that should allow you do remove Time Machine related files. This command should precede the coderm/code command.  The path to the codebypass/code command is given below.  precode/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass /code/pre  An example is given below.  precode/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass rm -f /path/to/file/name /code/pre  There also a service written by a third party that allows you do execute the codebypass/code/coderm/code commands from the Finder application. If interested, I could provide a link.  <comment320880> What version of macOS are you using? Also, I'm not clear from your question what you're actually trying to do. You first state that you're trying to delete things, but later worried that you might overwrite items. Are you trying to restore anything from the backup? Is the Time Machine backup the only thing on the disk? <comment320884> Version 10.11.6. I have slowly copied most backup files from my old disk. What I'd like to do now is re-home them on my new machine, and as I do so, delete files from the old disk so that I can see what is left and start to diff the backups. It's difficult enough to use the disk because it is slow and I'm concerned about breaking it, but this is made worse by not being able to manipulate files in Terminal. <comment321158> Fantastic, this is exactly what I needed. Seems I still need to "sudo rm", in case anyone else finds this. <comment321164> @Ben: Actually, feel free to edit my answer correct any mistakes I may have made. <comment321166> sure - actually I don't know if it's a mistake, or something unique about the permissions situation I have, anyway `bypass` is just what I wanted so thanks!
