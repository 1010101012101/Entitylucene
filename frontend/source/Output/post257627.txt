ruby version on macOS Sierra <body> Can someone let me know the version of ruby on macOS sierra? I have a public beta of macOS Sierra (10.12.1 build-16B2327e) and the version is 2.0.0.  I wanted to know if the stable version of macOS has a higher ruby version than 2.0.0.  <answer257629> coderuby --version/code says:     ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16 revision 53162) [universal.x86_64-darwin16]   macOS Sierra 10.12 (16A323) release installed from the App Store with XCode 8 installed  <answer262038> I like using   precode$ ruby -v  /code/pre  Ruby comes installed on macOS but the version is going to be older.  I had to install the newer version   If you have rvm installed already do rvm install &lt;version you want  like this:  precode$ rvm install 2.3.3 /code/pre  then make it the default like this:  precode$ rvm --default use 2.3.3 /code/pre  Source: rvm website  <answer262939> Using the first version of macOS Sierra 10.12 (Build 16A323), released on September 20, 2016 via the Mac App Store:  precode$ ruby --version ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16 revision 53162) [universal.x86_64-darwin16] /code/pre  This is on a fresh install emwithout/em Xcode installed. All users on emany/em version of Sierra should have emat least/em this version of Ruby available.  Also, Iâ€™ve verified that this same version is still present after upgrading to macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (Build 16B2555) via the Mac App Store.  <comment321793> is the macOS app store version or a beta version? <comment321794> Just a normal store download. <comment329408> This is also the version that ships with macOS Sierra 10.12, independent of whether you have Xcode installed.
