Change drive "block size" to 4096 <body> I just bought a 4tb hard drive and enclosure and attempted to encrypt it with truecrypt. I errored with a message saying the block size must be 4096 bytes for 2TB drive.  How do i alter the drive to have that block size?   Currently it says block size is 512  precodediskutil info /dev/disk2s2|grep "Block Size"    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes /code/pre  <answer188857> Format the drive using Disk Utility. Find out what disk identifier the drive has (code/dev/disk0, /dev/disk1, /dev/disk2,/code etc…). You can do so in Disk Utility.  Then use the command line tool codenewfs_hfs/code to create a new HFS file system on the disk. The command below is taken from here.  precodenewfs_hfs -v HFS_VOLUME_NAME -b 4k /dev/rdisk2s1 /code/pre  This creates a HFS volume with name "HFS_VOLUME_NAME" and a block size of 4k on the device with identifier codedisk2s1/code.  <answer188891> Sure you want to encrypt a drive that big?  Just FYI, any kind of file corruption on an encrypted volume usually means loss of the entire volume. If this drive is sitting on a shelf holding movies and pictures there's not much need.  If you are traveling with it, do you have a non-encrypted backup?  <comment365255> This is completely wrong. The -b switch determines the allocation block size which isn't related to the device block size (except that the allocation block size should be a 2^x multiple of the device block size and x≥3 if the real device block size is 4096 Byte (which it is on newer disks usually)) <comment365292> @klanomath Thank you for pointing out my mistake. Is my answer still salvageable through editing or should I delete my answer altogether? <comment365293> I have to look into it. A suitable answer is: put the hard drive in a different enclosure with a USB2SATA chip which reports a proper block size (because all newer HDDs have a device block size of 4096 Byte). The 512 Byte device block size is a so-called *logical device block size*.
