Random networking hangs when using the VPN -- how to fix/avoid? <body> Here's a brief description of a really annoying problem I've been seeing on several of my Macs:  ul liEvery so often, seemingly at random, all apps that try to use the network will hang (with the spinning rainbow wheel).  I have to force-quit them./li liWhen in this state, even doing a controlled shutdown hangs indefinitely; the only way I've found to clear the fault is to hold down the power button for 5 seconds to do a hard reboot./li liWhen in this state, non-networking applications still work fine (AFAICT); it's only when a program tries to access the network that it hangs/li liIn this state, I opened up a Terminal window and entered "ifconfig", and it hung after printing out information for a number of network devices; the last line it printed before it hung was one like this:  codeppp0: flags=8051&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1220/code/li liThe above leads me to think that the problem must be due to a bug/deadlock in Apple's VPN client software (the fault seems to happen mostly or perhaps exclusively when I am connected to my company's L2TP VPN)/li /ul  Originally I thought it might be a hardware problem, but I've seen it happen multiple times on three different Macs now (a Mac Pro, a Mac Mini, and a Powerbook), and I doubt that all three of them would have the same hardware problem.  I've seen this fault occur under El Capitan (10.11.4, 10.11.6) and Sierra (10.12.3).  It seems to happen several times a week, and sometimes several times a day.  Has anyone else encountered a problem like this, or know anything about it or how to fix/avoid it?  (I know one thing to do would be to use different VPN software, but I can't upgrade to e.g. OpenVPN until my company upgrades its VPN server to something that supports that)
