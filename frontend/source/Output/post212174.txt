New iPhone 6s doesn't have News app <body> I bought an iPhone 6s recently and my brother did so too, we just come pared them and it appears that my iPhone 6s doesn't have a default News app (the one that can't be deleted) but my brother does. Why is that?  <answer212181> On the apple forum it states from Sept. 24th that the news app is only available in the US. Maybe the phone of your brother has a US iTunes store account or was bought there?  Source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7236616  <answer212360> I found the solution. I just changed my region in the settings to United States, which restarted my iPhone when applied and adds the app.  <comment256181> What OS are they running and which country's app store are they using? <comment256182> iOS 9 and country Cyprus <comment256184> Change your region to US and reboot your phone. <comment256185> Yeah probably the region is the problem cause he set up it as us and I did as Cyprus. I think I'll try restoring it. <comment256186> Let us know if that works!
