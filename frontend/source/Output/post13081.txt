How can I do a Full Backup of my iTunes library (including Playlists and Album Art) to an external Hard Disk? <body> How can I backup my iTunes library (including album art and playlists) to an external Hard Disk 1?  iTunes only seems to allow full backups to discs.    FWIW, this is on a Win7 machine.    <answer13083> Luckily, Apple has heard your cries: iTunes: Back up your iTunes library by copying to an external hard drive:     h1Consolidate Library/h1      ol   liOpen iTunes Preferences: /li   liChoose iTunes  Preferences. /li   liClick Advanced./li   liMake sure the option to "Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to   library" is selected./li   liClick OK. /li   /ol      Note: After you click OK, iTunes   copies any files that are added that   weren't already in the iTunes Media   folder and places the copies in the   folder. The original files are left in   their original locations. To save   space on your hard disk, you might   want to delete the original files   after confirming import.      ol   liChoose File  Library  Organize Library./li   liSelect the option to "Consolidate files."  /li   /ol      Note: If you recently updated to   iTunes 9, you might want to consider   selecting the option to "Upgrade to   iTunes Media organization." This   updates the file organization of your   iTunes Media folder.      ol   liClick OK./li   /ol      h1Move to External Drive/h1      ol   liQuit iTunes./li   liLocate your external hard drive. /li   liOn the desktop or Finder sidebar. /li   liLocate your iTunes folder: /li   liBy default, the iTunes folder is located in: /Users/username/Music /li   /ol      If the iTunes folder is not in the   default location listed above then you   can find where the iTunes folder is   located by following these   instructions:      ol   liOpen your iTunes Preferences: /li   liChoose iTunes  Preferences. /li   liClick Advanced.

After a FFR (WinXP) due to crash, I've copied the iTunes folder into the new iTunes folder, but the library was missing several playlists and album covers.  Am I missing something? <comment13780> Playlists are stored in the itunes library.xml iirc, and the album art is meta data in the folders themselves. It is possible itunes did not pick this up or there might be an issue with the previous library. <comment13797> http://support.apple.com/kb/TA47831 How to backup and restore playlists, easiest way is to fileimport playlist, and select the old itunes library.xml file <comment13798> no difference between hard disk and hard drive in this context to me either.
