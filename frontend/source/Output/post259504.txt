Quicklook not working <body> Usually after I open quicklook and then close it again I cannot open quicklook again. And if I right click on an icon it lists exit quick look as an option but when I click it nothing changes.  What's my problem here?  I am on OSX 10.11.6  <answer260140> Try the following:  ol liOpen the Terminal application (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)/li liType codeqlmanage -r/code and hit enter/li liType codeqlmanage -r cache/code and hit enter/li liClose Terminal and restart your system/li /ol  This should force QuickLook to reload the generator lists and reset the disk cache.

I will come back if I have problems again, but for now you win <comment327687> This is back to not working again.  I don't feel like I should have to do this once a week <comment327728> It could perhaps also be a plugin from a 3rd party that is breaking something. For example when you install Adobe Illustrator, it adds the ability to view .ai files in quick look. Have you noticed if it happens with a certain file type at first or have you installed any specific software that could cause this?  You can use `qlmanage -h` to give you some tools for debugging quick look, if you feel comfortable using this.
