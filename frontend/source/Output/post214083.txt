What are "Items" in OS X Photos? <body> In my Photos library, there are some mysterious "items" that are not Photos/Videos. What are they?  My hunch is that they may be corrupted/unsupported video files, but I couldn't find a way to locate them and/or remove them :(  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uZ1nM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer215433> Turns out those are some .mp3 files- probably got carried-over from my Aperture library ¯_(ツ)_/¯
