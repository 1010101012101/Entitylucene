Why is the iCloud Photostream option not available in iOS preferences? <body> My iPhone 4 runs iOS 5.1.1.  When I go to settings  iCloud, the Photostream option is not available. I've tried to restore my phone, but the option is still not available.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z493m.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I activate this setting when it's missing from the preference?  <answer64333> Just looked a little closer at my settings.... Settings - General - Profiles - [Work Profile] - More Details - Disable Documents in the Cloud, iCloud backup, Photo Stream.  There's my answer, my company supplied configuration that was loaded on the phone limits this option.  C'est la vie...  <answer88977> Photos are no longer in the CAMERA.  They are in the Photos. (the blue background with the flower).  <comment75469> Same problem here with my iPhone 4S on Sprint...both the Photo Stream and Documents options are not available in Settings - iCloud. My wife also has an iPhone 4S on Verizon with no issues. <comment75471> Can you delete this account from the phone and perhaps try another account? Also - the troubleshooting article mentions that you can sign into iCloud on a computer and reset all the photos. Can you at least see the reset option if you don't want to reset everything to a clean slate and try again setting it up on the device. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4486 <comment75480> thanks for that. unfortunately it didn't solve my issue. I'm thinking: this is my professional phone. Is there a way for my employer to lock down this feature through the application of a profile (I know they use one e.g. for setting password policy)? <comment75514> Great answer - profiles can restrict a ton of options. <comment75515> Pierre...that might be it (my phone is a work-supplied as well). Maybe they're limiting our bandwidth usage?? I'll ping my tech support today. <comment75524> Bingo! I have the same limitation. Thanks a ton for your investigations!
