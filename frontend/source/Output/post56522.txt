Launch Genius via AppleScript <body> I would like to launch a Genius playlist for the currently playing song in iTunes via an AppleScript.  A prerequisite would be for the script to work when iTunes is in full screen.  And ideally, it wouldn't :  ul libring iTunes to front/li lileave an error message when genius isn't available for that song/li lidepend on the system language/li /ul  I found this script, but it doesn't work for me when iTunes is in full screen. Still, it's a great start.  It would maybe be possible to use the protocol the iOS "Remote" app uses, but that seems to be overkill.  Any help would be appreciated.  (the goal is to launch genius from softwares like Keyboard Maestro or Alfred)  <answer56626> Try this :  precodetell application "iTunes" to try     activate     with timeout of 10 seconds         reveal current track -- error if no current track         set tName to name of (first window whose its class is browser window or its class is playlist window)     end timeout on error     return "Can't find track!" end try  tell application "System Events"     tell application process "iTunes"         try             set b to (first button of window tName whose value of attribute "AXDescription" is "Genius")             if not (enabled of b) then return "Genius button disabled" -- (film, video clip,...)             perform action "AXPress" of b         on error -- no Genius button (radio, podcast, .....) playlist             return "Can't create genius list from that track!"         end try         delay 2         tell front window to if value of attribute "AXSubRole" is "AXDialog" then -- dialog opened.             perform action "AXPress" of button "OK" -- close the dialog             return "Can't create genius list from that track!"         end if     end tell end tell return "Done" /code/pre  <comment65033> I had to change `button "OK"` by `first button` to make it work with my french install, but it otherwise works great! Thanks! This said, I still hope someone bring up some magic in order to leave iTunes in the background.
