Is it possible to swap option and command keys for a specific keyboard? <body> I just bought a Logitech USB keyboard (Logitech K120, if that matters.) It's a Windows keyboard, so it has a Windows key and an alt key. The Windows key maps to Command, and the Alt key maps to option. The keys are reversed from their positions on a normal Mac keyboard. It's driving me nuts.  I'm running 10.12.1 (Sierra)  Is there any way to remap them, for this specific keyboard?  <answer263986> Have you looked into using a keyboard remapping program such as Sharp Keys?  <answer264041> You can change the functions of the modifier keys (Caps Lock, Control, Option, Command) in System Preferences - Keyboard - Modifier Keys.  If you have more than one keyboard, the setting window allows you to select and set separate mapping for each one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/es5i4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment330788> No, I'm not familiar with those. That will do what I need? <comment330789> Most likely @DuncanC try it out and see where it takes you. <comment330801> @klanomath, see my edit. <comment330802> That's a Windows app. How should it work in OS X/macOS? <comment330812> If you go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Modifier Keys you cannot select the keyboard you want? <comment330877> @techraf, that's exactly what I was looking for. I looked in the keyboards system preferences panel, but missed the modifier keys button. Can you post your solution as an answer so I can accept/up-vote it? <comment330878> Sharp Keys is a windows utility. Are there similar programs for Mac OS? <comment330879> I wasn't sure about Sierra, I will post an answer. <comment330898> Cool. This is exactly what I wanted. Thank you.
