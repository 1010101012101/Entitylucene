Free programming editor w/ syntax highlighting for iBook G4 running Mac OS X 10.4.11 (PowerPC) <body> I am looking for a free programming editor for my iBook G4.  I was going to to get the lightswitch trial until I looked at the sys requirements (needs Intel CPU).  Can someone please point me to a free editor that will work with a G4 iBook running 10.4.11 and supports html, css, javascript, php and c# syntax highlighting?  <answer59782> TextWrangler will do. It's a freeware, but you probably need to search for an older version.  <answer59783> ul liVIM/li lijEdit (Java app but I like it)/li /ul  <comment68793> Lightswitch also requires Windows... <comment68818> yes... at the time, I was very near ready to install some linux with wine should all else fail. And very tired. But you are right of course, it requires Windows. <comment68819> Thanks for your help. I'm going to try the linked VIM from the other post first, but if that doesn't work I'll start looking for legacy TextWrangler versions and post a direct link at the end of the topic if I find one. <comment68822> *rejoices* A direct link to a download that will work with my system. Thank you!
