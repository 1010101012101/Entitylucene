Charge MacBook with USB (Adapters?) <body> I want to buy an external charger, it has USB. Are there any adapters (including transformators, I think that might be needed, right?) so I can charge my MacBook with the external charger?  <answer181967> There're external batteries like this: http://www.amazon.com/HyperJuice-External-Battery-MacBook-Smartphones/dp/B009I5AZTY  <answer181974> That is not possible.   The USB can not carry the Voltage (14 V) and Current ( 1 Amp) required to charge MBP.  If it is for the car, you can try this product http://www.amazon.com/Spal-Magsafe-Adapter-Charger-Notebook/dp/B009G1B22O  <comment216457> Well those are extremely expensive. And I wanted to know whether there are adapters.
