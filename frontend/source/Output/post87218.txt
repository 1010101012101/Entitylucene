system_profiler applications inventory <body> Running this:  precodesystem_profiler -detailLevel full /code/pre  produces an inventory of applications, among other things.  How does they system "know" about these apps?  ul liSpotlight? (e.g. every time a folder is created/renamed with the .app extension..)/li lisearching the filesystem at the moment of invocation? (e.g. codefind -type d -name '*.app'/code ...)/li liscanning predefined paths?/li liother?/li /ul  Would stopping the md service affect the output? Restoring from TimeMachine?  What I'd ultimately like to do is to emquery/em this "database", if it is a db and not some "just-in-time" query.  Useful queries:  ul liScan for outdated/insecure downloads of application X, if version = Y/li liIs uTorrent present anywhere?/li liDoes this system have PPC applications on it still?/li lietc./li /ul  <answer110801> I would suggest running codeopensnoop/code while running the codesystem_profiler/code command.  I just did that, and with the full detail level as you have it there are over 25,000 files that are being read by system_profiler. It looks like it is reading plist files to get the output as well as reproducing various system logs.  If you stop md or restore from TimeMachine the output will change.  <comment130447> Where exactly in the output are you talking about finding the list of apps? Can you provide a snippet? So I can match up my query.
