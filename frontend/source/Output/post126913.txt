How can I get rid of this Symantec-related error message in console? <body> I was forced by my company to un-install Synamtec Antivirus on a machine running OS X 10.6.8.  Unfortunately, the person who uninstalled Symantec didn't know how to thoroughly get rid of the program.  As a result, this error message pops up in the console about every 10 seconds:   precode4/8/14 6:09:30 PM   com.apple.launchd.peruser.503[351]  (com.nds.pcshow) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds 4/8/14 6:09:40 PM   com.apple.launchd.peruser.503[351]  (com.symantec.quickmenu.application[554]) posix_spawn("/Library/Application Support/Symantec/SymQuickMenu/SymQuickMenu.app/Contents/MacOS/SymQuickMenu", ...): No such file or directory 4/8/14 6:09:40 PM   com.apple.launchd.peruser.503[351]  (com.symantec.quickmenu.application[554]) Exited with exit code: 1 4/8/14 6:09:40 PM   com.apple.launchd.peruser.503[351]  (com.symantec.quickmenu.application) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds 4/8/14 6:09:40 PM   com.nds.pcshow[555] sh: /Users/dcjones3/Library/NDSPCShowServer/NDSPCShowServer.bundle/Contents/Resources/launch.sh: No such file or directory 4/8/14 6:09:40 PM   com.apple.launchd.peruser.503[351]  (com.nds.pcshow[555]) Exited with exit code: 127 /code/pre  What can I do to get rid of these error messages?  <answer130385> h2Symantec provides a utility for uninstall/h2  Removing all Norton programs for Mac by using the RemoveSymantecMacFiles removal utility  hr  h2Alternative Uninstall Methods/h2  A bom file is a "strongB/strong ill   strongO/strong f   strongM/strong aterials" receipt that includes a list of every file installed and the install locations. If your software was installed using an installer, chances are good that a bom receipt was also installed.  You should be able to find Symantec's bom file by opening /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app, and typing the command  precode  ls /private/var/db/receipts/ |more /code/pre  and looking for a file with a name that includes "symantec," something like "com.norton.symantec.bom" or try this command instead  precode ls /private/var/db/receipts/ |grep symantec /code/pre  You can view the file, and get the list and locations of all files installed with the Symantec installer with the lsbom command like so (once you have the correct name of the bom file -- I am just guessing):  precode lsbom /private/var/db/receipts/com.norton.symantec.bom /code/pre  And you can then remove the files listed there by location manually one by one.  hr  h2another way to uninstall/h2  You are welcome to use my uninstaller script. The script will place all files installed into the user's Trash. Once you have installed the script's dependencies, xcode, macports, and rmtrash, you can use the script by copying it into a text file and saving it as "installer" somewhere in your $PATH, such as /usr/local/bin/ , and applying the command  precode chmod +x /usr/local/bin/installer /code/pre  Here is the uninstaller script:  precode #!/bin/bash  #uninstaller /private/var/db/receipts/com.url.name.of.app.bom  #uninstall os x application installed with installer -pkg  #using (user) provided bom receipt  #place all installed files and directories in user's Trash   lsbom="/usr/bin/lsbom"  cd="/usr/bin/cd"  sudo="/usr/bin/sudo"  xargs="/usr/bin/xargs"  rmtrash="/opt/local/bin/rmtrash"   lsbom -fls "$1" | (cd /; sudo xargs rmtrash -u $USER)  exit /code/pre  Installing MacPorts and rmtrash is simple enough once xcode (for Mavericks 10.9 xcode_5.1.1.dmg) is installed. Install xcode, and then enter these commands in Terminal.app :  precode curl -Ok https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2  tar xf MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2  cd MacPorts-2.2.1  ./configure  make  sudo make install #not war!  cd ..  rm -rf Macports-*  sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate  export PATH=$HOME/macports/bin:$HOME/macports/sbin:$PATH  export MANPATH=$HOME/macports/share/man:$MANPATH  sudo port -vsc install rmtrash  diskutil quiet repairPermissions / /code/pre  MacPorts is worth getting to know as it is a mature package manager for OS X that maintains thousands of open source software commands, utilities, and applications, such as ClamAV for example, the finest antivirus software ever developed for *nix-based operating systems like Mac OS X. Apple even includes ClamAV with the Server versions of Mac OS X.  precode port install -vsc clamav /code/pre  Originally developed for scanning email for mail servers, it is unmatched antivirus. ClamAV has a pdf user manual.  <comment163679> Thanks so much for your detailed reply!  Unfortunately, I was not able to find a BOM file for Norton/Symantec...I guess that I'm stuck with the error messages for now.  In any case, thanks for the info about MacPorts and ClamAV!
