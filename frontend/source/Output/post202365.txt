Can you disable toolbar by default in Finder? <body> In Yosemite, opening folders in a new window by default is extremely difficult. You can press CMD as you click (not optimal) or right-click/option-click the folder to open in a new window (not optimal).  The solution that seems to work best for me is to hide the toolbar whenever I open / create a new folder, because folders inside windows that do not have a toolbar will always open in a new window.  But the toolbar always reappears whenever I create a new folder.   So, ideally, I would love to have it ALWAYS hidden by default, and on rare occasions when I need it (to look at external drives, or drag an item into the application folder for example), I would shortcut-make it appear, ta-daam.  <answer202390> This emshould/em work:  ul liClose all open strongFinder/strong windows/li liOpen a New Finder window and arrange it to your liking./li liFrom the Menu select strongView/strong then strongShow View Options/strong kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdJ/kbd/li liClick the strongUse as Defaults/strong button at the bottom./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MN673.png" alt="Lonely folder"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbD2y.png" alt="View Options Dialog"  h3Toolbar/h3  Also, the strongView/strong Menu shows many shortcuts to toggle view options.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ytZDl.png" alt="Finder View Options Menu"  <comment248831> Thank you! I'll mark this as solved although for the moment I mostly use the shortcut that removes the sidebar cmd+alt+T
