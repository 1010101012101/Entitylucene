Can I update the iCloud password from a terminal? <body> I have several Macs in a different country, and I would like to update their iCloud password remotely. I can login to the machines via SSH, but the firewall does not allow me to use VNC.  I would like to know how to update iCloud password using only terminal commands. Is there any way?  <answer190217> check out the "security" command . it my work.  <comment225737> Thanks. I have already read the man page, but I could not figure out how to do it.
