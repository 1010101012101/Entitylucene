share photos on facebook with iPad3 <body> I am trying to share photos on fb with my ipad 3, but the photos are not showing up. What could be the reason?  <comment72017> What version of iOS are you using? Are you trying to share them with the Facebook app itself, or from something else? Do you get any errors? Does it attempt to upload the photos? Does it appear as though it has actually uploaded the photos? <comment72058> latest iOS. I'm using FB App for iPad. it logs into facebook and then come back to iPhoto with no error messages.
