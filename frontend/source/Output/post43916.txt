stopping the expansion of the safari window after opening a new tab <body> When opening a new tab in safari while not browsing in full-screen mode, the safari window expands, in order to preserve the content of the webpage shown. I think this is quite annoying, is there a way to prevent this?  <answer43919> I'm not sure of an elegant solution, but choosing to always show the tab bar will never have to increase the size of the window, since it would always be there  <comment49919> That's indeed a solution, but not what I was looking for... <comment157416> I understand that the window grows in height, to welcome the bar of tabs. <comment157493> Yes, I am aware of that, but it would be nice if I could turn it off.
