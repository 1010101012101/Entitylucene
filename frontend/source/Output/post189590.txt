Search Photos-App for faces <body> At the first start ever of the Photos-App, after it imported all images it could find, the program automatically searches all images for faces.    Later it only does it with newly imported images.    The problem is that I deleted multiple faces and now, Photos doesn't show the circles around the faces anymore when looking at the images. I know that I can add the faces manually, but I'd like to know, wether I can search the whole library again, like at the beginning?
