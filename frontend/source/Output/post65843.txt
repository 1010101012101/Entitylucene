Why are there VPN-related log entries in my iPad's console log when I'm not using any VPN? <body> I'm seeing entries related to VPN access in my iPad's system log (via an app called 'System Console'), but I don't know why they're appearing. I've never used a VPN or any form of remote access Software and VPN is not turned on in my Settings menu.  I've tried to remedy this by resetting my iPad network settings to the factory defaults, but no luck.  Does anyone know what is causing this and how I can resolve it?  Here are the relevant log entries:  precode2012-09-28 18:20:31 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager setEnabled:]:(2012-09-28 18:20:31 +0000) Requested wifi power change to ON 2012-09-28 18:20:41 +0000 Preferences -[VPNBundleController _vpnConfigurationChanged:] (0x1f064660:&lt;VPNBundleController: 0x1f064660&gt;): _serviceCount(0), serviceCount(0), toggleInRootMenu(0), RootMenuItem(1) 2012-09-28 18:20:41 +0000 Preferences -[VPNConnectionStore reloadVPN]: The active VPN configuration has changed from  to (null) 2012-09-28 18:20:50 +0000 Preferences -[VPNBundleController _vpnConfigurationChanged:] (0x1f064660:&lt;VPNBundleController: 0x1f064660&gt;): _serviceCount(0), serviceCount(0), toggleInRootMenu(0), RootMenuItem(1) 2012-09-28 18:20:50 +0000 Preferences -[VPNConnectionStore reloadVPN]: The active VPN configuration has changed from  to (null) 2012-09-28 18:20:51 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager(Private) _scanCompletedWithResults:]: Had to add our current network(Lowes-Guest-WiFi) back into our network cache 2012-09-28 18:21:01 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager(Private) _scanCompletedWithResults:]: Had to add our current network(Lowes-Guest-WiFi) back into our network cache 2012-09-28 18:21:06 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager(Private) _powerChanged]:(2012-09-28 18:21:06 +0000) power changed callback, power is now: OFF 2012-09-28 18:21:06 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager setEnabled:]:(2012-09-28 18:21:06 +0000) Requested wifi power change to OFF 2012-09-28 18:21:07 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager setEnabled:]:(2012-09-28 18:21:07 +0000) Requested wifi power change to ON 2012-09-28 18:21:08 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager(Private) _powerChanged]:(2012-09-28 18:21:08 +0000) power changed callback, power is now: ON 2012-09-28 18:21:14 +0000 Preferences -[VPNBundleController _vpnConfigurationChanged:] (0x1f064660:&lt;VPNBundleController: 0x1f064660&gt;): _serviceCount(0), serviceCount(0), toggleInRootMenu(0), RootMenuItem(1) 2012-09-28 18:21:14 +0000 Preferences -[VPNConnectionStore reloadVPN]: The active VPN configuration has changed from  to (null) 2012-09-28 18:21:20 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager(Private) _scanCompletedWithResults:]: Had to add our current network(Lowes-Guest-WiFi) back into our network cache 2012-09-28 18:21:21 +0000 Preferences -[APSettingsController specifiers]: Lowes-Guest-WiFi: _canForget(1), _canSetAutoJoin(1) 2012-09-28 18:21:22 +0000 kbd -[TIXPCDataTransport _handleForPurpose:withReplyBlock:] couldn't get data source for purpose=__TIRDTAB 2012-09-28 18:21:24 +0000 Preferences -[VPNBundleController _vpnConfigurationChanged:] (0x1f064660:&lt;VPNBundleController: 0x1f064660&gt;): _serviceCount(0), serviceCount(0), toggleInRootMenu(0), RootMenuItem(1) 2012-09-28 18:21:24 +0000 Preferences -[VPNConnectionStore reloadVPN]: The active VPN configuration has changed from  to (null) 2012-09-28 18:21:33 +0000 Preferences -[VPNBundleController _vpnConfigurationChanged:] (0x1f064660:&lt;VPNBundleController: 0x1f064660&gt;): _serviceCount(0), serviceCount(0), toggleInRootMenu(0), RootMenuItem(1) 2012-09-28 18:21:33 +0000 Preferences -[VPNConnectionStore reloadVPN]: The active VPN configuration has changed from  to (null) 2012-09-28 18:21:33 +0000 Preferences WiFi: Joined (null) 2012-09-28 18:21:33 +0000 Preferences -[VPNBundleController _vpnConfigurationChanged:] (0x1f064660:&lt;VPNBundleController: 0x1f064660&gt;): _serviceCount(0), serviceCount(0), toggleInRootMenu(0), RootMenuItem(1) 2012-09-28 18:21:33 +0000 Preferences -[VPNConnectionStore reloadVPN]: The active VPN configuration has changed from  to (null) 2012-09-28 18:22:20 +0000 Preferences -[VPNBundleController _vpnConfigurationChanged:] (0x1f064660:&lt;VPNBundleController: 0x1f064660&gt;): _serviceCount(0), serviceCount(0), toggleInRootMenu(0), RootMenuItem(1) 2012-09-28 18:22:20 +0000 Preferences -[VPNConnectionStore reloadVPN]: The active VPN configuration has changed from  to (null) 2012-09-28 18:22:21 +0000 Preferences -[VPNBundleController _vpnConfigurationChanged:] (0x1f064660:&lt;VPNBundleController: 0x1f064660&gt;): _serviceCount(0), serviceCount(0), toggleInRootMenu(0), RootMenuItem(1) 2012-09-28 18:22:21 +0000 Preferences -[VPNConnectionStore reloadVPN]: The active VPN configuration has changed from  to (null) 2012-09-28 18:22:21 +0000 Preferences -[WiFiManager(Private) _scanCompletedWithResults:]: Had to add our current network(linksys) back into our network cache 2012-09-28 18:22:21 +0000 Preferences WiFi: Joined linksys /code/pre  <comment77447> Given that the logs are saying that your VPN is unconfigured, there's really not very much you need to worry about. <comment77448> Really-?  Thank you. <comment77449> @Nathan Greenstein - Thanks for your help  :) <comment77450> WHY would this even show in my LOGS then?  I have NEVER used a VPN or any remote access program? <comment77451> Your logs basically say that the VPN settings are being changed from 'nothing' to 'nothing'. It looks like this was triggered right after you connected to a WiFi network. My guess is that the iPad checked if there is a VPN set up when you connected to a network, and found that there wasn't. This is probably triggered for all iPads regardless of whether a VPN has been used in the past.
