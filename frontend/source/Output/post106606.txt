iPhone 4S on iOS 5.1 not being offered update by iTunes <body> iTunes (v11.1.1) is saying my phone's OS is up to date (tried clicking check for updates). Why is that?  If I force update with a downloaded .ipsw (using SHIFT-update), do I have to use the latest iOS 7 or is 6 still being signed for iPhone 4?  Current status is strongjailbroken/strong. What are my options?  <comment125400> iOS 6 is not being signed by Apple anymore. You'd have to go with iOS 7. <comment130245> See my answer here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/110585/18387
