iTunes Match and iOS device storage <body> When I enabled iTunes Match (which is generally embrilliant/em), it wiped my iPhone's music library as I expected it to, but it didn't wipe my iPad library.   Now that I've got iTunes Match working so nicely, I want to reclaim the space from the music I was carrying around in case I wanted it. But I can't find a way to bulk-delete music either on the device or from iTunes. Now that it's Match-managed, iTunes shows my music listing greyed out and uneditable. On the iPad I can delete songs one by one, but that's not what I want.  How can I wipe clean an iTunes Match-driven music library on an iOS device?  <answer34088> I don't know a way to do it on the device, but you should be able to do it in iTunes by turning off music syncing.  <answer34868> SettingsGeneralUsage Wait for the storage amounts to load then click on Music and swipe left or right.  It will delete all the music on the iDevise in on fell swoop.  <comment39762> Yes it does! Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!!
