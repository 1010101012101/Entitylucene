Is there any way to get the Multi-Safari version of Safari 2 working on Snow Leopard? <body> Michel Fortin’s Multi-Safari actually makes it possible to test websites i old versions of Safari, should you feel the need.  Unfortunately, the Multi-Safari version of Safari 2 doesn’t quite work properly in Snow Leopard. For me, it worked for a few minutes. Then, for no apparent reason, it stopped loading web pages — the progress bar would stay stuck at a fairly short length, and the status bar would say it was waiting for the web site.  Is there any way to get it working reliably on Snow Leopard?  <answer22076> Safari 2, sorry, why would you need to test for that? It's REALLY not in use by anyone anymore.   Anyway, the best way I can think of running it is to virtualise an earlier version of OS X - Tiger or Jaguar.  <comment24393> “It's REALLY not in use by anyone anymore.” — A statement which holds perfectly until someone, somewhere, complains that your site doesn’t work on Safari 2. I do entirely take your point though. <comment24627> Oh — [is it possible to virtualize PowerPC versions of Mac OS X on an Intel Mac](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22262/can-you-virtualize-powerpc-versions-of-mac-os-x-on-intel-macs)? <comment24634> You can virtualise OS X 10.4.4-10.4.8 (Intel) with some effort - there were some hackintosh techniques for doing it. I'll try find some. Ask you can see here the Safari 3 install base is really minuscule, Safari 2 will be even tinier.
