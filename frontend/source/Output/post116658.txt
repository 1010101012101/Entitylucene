Thanks.  <answer116693> If you have Aperture, you can create libraries without importing the original. I have my photos on different libraries. One on my usual Mac and and a few others on external disks on another Mac. It might be a bit slow but it works  <answer255281> You just need an SMB or AFP file browser app.  I use FileExplorer to browse network shares from iOS. It will definitely work for your needs.  There is also a free version available  <comment136453> I'm a bit confused because this seems very brief. What are you browsing from. Where are the pictures in the Mac? You only want this function locally? <comment136555> So I have a  - mac on the local network - iOS devices on the local network - 1000s of images on the mac (Aperture/Shared_Folder) - access images on the iOS devices - slideshows etc
