Using visudo to edit sudoers on Mac <body> I have managed to make the sudoers file on my Mac erorr. eg.  precode$ sudo visudo &gt;&gt;&gt; /etc/sudoers: syntax error near line 45 &lt;&lt;&lt; sudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers near line 45 sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting /code/pre  So, I went and got the standard sudoers file from here, logged in as root and copied it from Documents to /etc.....but still no joy.  If I try to run 'visudo' using root it fires up Sublime Text and I see a blank sudoers.tmp which I understand is the lock file.  If I try and copy the contents of the downloaded sudoers file into sudoers.tmp using Sublime I get the above error.  So, does anyone have a solution to this? What should I see when I run the 'visudo' command, Sublime Text and sudoers.tmp?  many thanks, George   <answer130176> If your codevisudo/code does not work as expected, maybe because your editor does not work correctly, try setting the the codeEDITOR/code environment variable to a sane value, then launching codevisudo/code:  precodeEDITOR=nano visudo /code/pre  for codesh/code, codebash/code, codedash/code, and compatible.  <answer181241> I ran into this issue today, and was helped along by the information above, but I wanted to keep my editor set to sublime for other purposes.  I added the following to my ~/.bash_profile, which solves the visudo issue, but doesn't change my default editor for git, etc.  precodealias visudo='EDITOR=vi sudo visudo' /code/pre  When executed, this changes the editor to vi for the command that follows, and lets you edit the sudoers file successfully.  <comment152454> I assume you use `bash` as your shell. Try `EDITOR=nano visudo` as root. <comment152457> That worked!!! Thanks very much. I had to make sure I saved it out as sudoers rather than sudoers.tmp <comment152458> I'll answer it, so you can mark the question as answered. <comment152497> `EDITOR=vi` if you're masochistic. <comment215501> You can set `SUDO_EDITOR` instead of `EDITOR` to avoid that. Also `EDITOR=vi sudo visudo` (without a `;` before the `sudo`) changes the value of the env variable only for that command, not for the whole shell. <comment215873> Thanks @Patrix, good tip re: simplifying my alias, I edited my answer above to reflect that.  As for your other tip, I tried adding `export SUDO_EDITOR='/usr/bin/vi'` to my `~/.bash_profile`, but it didn't seem to effect the `sudo visudo` command at all, my EDITOR environment variable still seemed to be in effect, at least on my machine running OSX 10.9.5. <comment215875> You are right. SUDO_EDITOR only works for `sudo -e /path/to/file`, not for `visudo`. And `sudo -e` *must not* be used to edit the sudoers file because no syntax checking will be done in that case. <comment302866> Neither EDITOR, nor SUDO_EDITOR work properly for me. I use `alias visudo='VISUAL=vim sudo visudo'` instead.
