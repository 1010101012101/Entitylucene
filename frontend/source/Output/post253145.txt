Connect macbook to another display <body> I have a 2006 MacBook with a seemingly dead black screen. When powered up, it emits heat, so I assume it's just the screen that doesn't work anymore.  I am trying to connect it to another display, so I can see what I am doing, to copy whatever is on its hdd to another.   So I've bought a mini-DVI - hdmi adaptor, and connected it to another display.  The problem is that it doesn't seem to work, the other display remains black too.  What am I missing ? Also how can I know that my MacBook is indeed running, and is not dead altogether ?  PS : it's running on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger  <comment315023> Does it chime at startup, or is there a loss of sound as well? <comment315037> Well I can't hear a thing except the drive turning, but the small led at the front is lighted up <comment315039> If you have the startup disc, I suggest seeing if you can at least bootup with that. Might me a corrupt OS. <comment315086> Also make sure to change the modes in the monitor for example if you're using hdmi to thunderbolt, switch the hdmi option.
