Dim LED on Magsafe, Macbook Pro won't boot <body> I have a Macbook Pro late 2008, and today, it suddenly decided to stop booting. The battery level is very low, and connecting the adapter to it shows a emvery/em dim green light on the Magsafe connector. When I remove the adapter, the battery indicator light on the side of the Mac flashes rapidly, indicating low charge.   So far, I've tried the following things:  ol liConnected two different adapters to the Mac. Both give the same problem./li liChecked all the adapters on a different Mac. All of them seem to be working./li liReset the SMC./li liTried booting without the battery./li liTried booting with 0/1/2 RAM sticks attached./li /ol  Is there anything I can do to fix this myself, or is it likely to be a major hardware fault that will require professional servicing? I would rate my own computer repair skills as fairly decent, and can swap out any parts myself, but fixing a faulty chip on the logic board would be well beyond me.
