my iphone was stolen, i have an apple id but no cloud back up <body> my phone was stolen while I was in hospital having my baby, it had a lot of pictures on it of when I was pregnant, I have no other pictures apart from what was on this phone, is there any way possible I can access them? I never set up access from the cloud as have tried this is there anyway of accessing them through apple id alone? the phone has been locked by my network provider and the sim card should no longer be accessible   <comment250907> You mention backup not being set up, but that's one of two iCloud possibilities.  You should double check to make sure photo stream was never set up on the phone, go to http://www.icloud.com from a computer (in this case not from a iPhone/iPad) and log in with your Apple ID.
