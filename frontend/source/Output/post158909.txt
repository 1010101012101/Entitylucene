iCal and email invites not connected anymore <body> When My boss and me scheduled meetings we used to send via email and you could click on the invite and it would automatically open that date and time with the meeting information in iCal.  All of a sudden I no longer have that ability.  I click on the invite from my boss and it does nothing.  What happened and how do I fix it.  <comment186784> Which version of OS X do you use? Yosemite? <comment186785> [This link might help](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5504145).  If you use Yosemite, it seems a lot of things that have to do with Internet Accounts are still very flaky.  Often it helps to remove all accounts in System Preferences - Internet Accounts, restart the computer and put them back in.  Make sure you have backups before you attempt something like this. <comment186802> I believe its snow leopard 10.9.5.
