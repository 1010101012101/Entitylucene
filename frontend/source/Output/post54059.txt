Is there an alternative to Application Switcher with search? <body> On Windows, I've been using Switcher and the one feature that I really like is being able to switch to applications by typing in portions of their title. Is there an application for Mac OS X (10.7) that provides similar functionality?  <answer54060> h1Alfred (free)/h1  ul lifind any application or file/li lithis app will learn and prioritize your searches/li lisystem commands and extended features (google search, bitly...)/li liyou can get more powerful features when purchasing the powerpack/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gnwC.png" alt="enter image description here"  h1Quicksilver (free)/h1  ul lifind any application or file/li lithis app will learn and prioritize your searches/li lilots of strongfree/strong plugins with extend the functionalities  ul limove files/li liexecute bash commands/li li.../li /ul/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dabLz.png" alt="enter image description here"  h1Spotlight (built-in)/h1  ...which is part of the OS and be triggered using kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdspace/kbd (default shortcut).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Y2qt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment61884> Not to be too picky, but all of these apps only switch by Application Name, not Window Title. Ideally, I would like to use document names or web page titles to switch between apps.
