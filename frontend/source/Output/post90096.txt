How to delete duplicate photo album? <body> I wanted to create a separate photo album with my wallpapers on my iPhone 4s. So I synced the photos from my computer, but now on my phone I have my "Wallpapers" album and a duplicate album "Photo Library", I tried deleting one or the other but that option is unavailable.   Does anyone know how I can resolve this?  Thanks.   <answer98533> From the photos app on the iphone press edit on the top-right corner and press on the emminus/em sign before the album you want to remove. The camera roll/Photo Library cannot be deleted because it is pre-made by the operating system.  <comment105783> Did you try emptying the album before deleting?
