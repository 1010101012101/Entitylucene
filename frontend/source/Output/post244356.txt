I have rebooted it several times, the first time worked but a few weeks later it has happened again and now won't clear. Help please ?   <answer244371> Go to your Settings app, then Cellular. Make sure that Cellular Data is on, then go to Cellular Data Options and make sure that all settings (except Data Roaming) are enabled.
