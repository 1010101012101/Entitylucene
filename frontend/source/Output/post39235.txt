Specifically, I'd like to update two computers to Lion 10.7.3. The problem is that one computer is in English and the other in Japanese. Can I download the OS X Lion Update 10.7.3 once from this page and install it on both computers?  <answer39283> To the best of my knowledge, the updates are not language-dependant. Certainly the documentation for the downloads support that:     Supported Languages   Deutsch, English, Français, 日本語, Español, Italiano, Nederlands, Dansk, Norsk Bokmål, Polski, Português, Português Brasileiro, Pусский, Suomi, Svensk, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 한국어, Albanian, Arabic, British English, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonia, Malay Malaysia, Montenegro, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese   (from the 10.7.3 combo page).
