Can't use ⌃⌘Space for Evernote Helper as shortcut is already in use <body> I love Evernote and I used to Evernote helper with the shortcut: kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⌃/kbd + kbdspace/kbd.  I have since reinstalled Mavericks and now can't use this shortcut any more.  Just changed Special Characters shortcut to kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⌥/kbd + kbdT/kbd. (it was kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⌃/kbd + kbdspace/kbd), but I still can't use this shortcut for Evernote helper.  Evernote only says:     The key combination kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⌃/kbd + kbdspace/kbd can't be used!br   The key combination "Command + Control + Space" can't be used because it's already used by a system-wide keyboard shortcut. (If you really want to use this key combination, most shortcuts can be changed in the Keyboard &amp; Mouse Panel in System Preferences)   …but I've already changed the Special Characters shortcut.  <answer131393> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongShortcuts/strong → strongSpotlight/strong and disable the strongShow Spotlight window/strong option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oeM4K.png" alt=""  <comment154312> so it sounds like you changed special characters away from using the cmd ctrl space shortcut, but did you set evernote helper to use that shortcut (in the same place)? <comment154356> Yes. right. but I can't understand what place is. Helppppp... <comment154357> thx for your help. But I'm telling about com ctrl space. <comment154363> I tried as well to change the shortcut for the emoji icons.  Although the new shortcut does work Evernote still won't let me use ⌘⌃space.   I wonder if they have it hard coded so that you can't use ⌘⌃space keyboard shortcut combination.  i was able to assign ⌘⌃space to another app shortcut key with no problem, for example Spotlight. <comment154368> @HyunHee Apologies, the post was edited for kbd tags and I didn't notice it changed the key
