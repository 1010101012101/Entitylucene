Is there a way to know when a new iOS app is released by a specific company? <body> I'd love to know when Kairosoft gets a new game released on iOS.  Is there an app or site that monitors the daily release list against a user supplied criteria?    <answer59904> One quick way is on AppShopper.com.  ul liEnter "Kairosoft" in the search box./li liClick on any app title link. /li liScroll to the bottom of the screen and click on the "Other Apps By This Developer" link. This will bring up a custom page for that developer listing all of their app titles and update info./li liA custom RSS feed is also generated in the upper-right corner of the screen. This feed will update for any new app releases./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9mLaq.png" alt="enter image description here"
