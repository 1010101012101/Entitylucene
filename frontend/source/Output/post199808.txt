MacBook Pro (17-inch, Mid 2010) screen displaying low number of colors <body> My 17-inch, Mid 2010 MacBook Pro's screen now displays a limited number of colors, kind of "fuzzy". See this photo  I search on the internet but I could not find a case similar to mine. Not search on which keywords to use to describe the issue, though.  Does anyone knows this? Is it fixable?  <answer199810> As I see the screenshot, the colors on that display are inverted.   Try unchecking codeSettings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &gt; Invert colors/code  Also take a look at the strongDisplay contrast/strong and the strongIncrease contrast/strong options.   Here is a screenshot of the default settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MWOqJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment240611> To test if it is your screen or the general graphics problem, if you have a cable connect it to external monitor or a TV. Also, start in Safe mode to test. <comment240791> External display : working fine. Safe mode : same issue. I tried to reset the NVRAM, but it broke the system (couldn't boot anymore, and had to restore through recovery) and did not fix the screen issue. <comment240792> I have the same settings here. <comment240793> Then it seems to be a hardware issue. Check the cable between the Logic board and the Display itself, also you may check if it's the Video chip. <comment240817> Well it is not your GPU :) now lets see what it says in the About this Mac- Color LCD. It might be the internal cable (which is not easy to access. Also open the ColorSyncUtility app in your Utility folder and check for what profile is it using, or try changing it to another color profile.
