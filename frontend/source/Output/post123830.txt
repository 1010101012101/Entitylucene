Can I set Chrome to start Spotify from weblinks? <body> How can I set my Mac to open the Spotify application when I click on a weblink? While I have the appropriate preference set in Spotify...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jC8Cb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ... all Spotify URLs still open in the web player. (Almost always these are links friends send me over Facebook chat.)   I'm using Mavericks 10.9.2 and the most recent build of Chrome.
