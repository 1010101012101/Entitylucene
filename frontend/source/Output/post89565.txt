Disable Screen sharing via the command line in mountain lion <body> I want to be able to enable and disable screen sharing from the command line rather than through System Preferences. This is on 10.8.3  To enable screen sharing, I find I only need to change a dictionary value in the following plist:   code/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist/code  To be precise, to enable screen sharing, I do the following:  codesudo defaults write /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing -dict Disabled -bool false/code  And that changes:  precodesudo defaults read /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing {     Disabled = 1; } /code/pre  To:  precodesudo defaults read /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing {     Disabled = 0; } /code/pre  Fine. I see from this site that I need to then do this (not sure why):  codesudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist/code  Now if I want to disable screen sharing I try the reverse:  precodesudo defaults write /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing -dict Disabled -bool true /code/pre  I get:  precodesudo defaults read /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing {     Disabled = 1; } /code/pre  Which is good, but then I have no successful way to get launchctl, or whatever (not really sure) to re-read this plist.  I try   codesudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist/code  and I get:  codenothing found to load/code  And indeed, despite the dictionary value for this screen sharing being properly set to indicate screen sharing should be off, well, I still can screen share in just fine.  So what is the proper way to disable screen sharing from the command line on 10.8.3?  <answer89567> To start screensharing:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist /code/pre  To stop:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist /code/pre  The code-w/code flag modifies the codeDisabled/code key as appropriate. It's best to let launchctl handle this, as the location where the config files are stored has changed a bit between OS versions.
