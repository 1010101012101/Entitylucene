Why does the highlighted text color in Xcode's Project Navigator sometimes switch to white with a blue shadow? <body> Normally a selected item in Xcode's Project Navigator is indicated by a blue bar behind the item. However, sometimes for no apparent reason this changes to white text with a kind of very light blue drop shadow and no background color change. Does anyone know why this occurs  or how to prevent it? To fix it I always just have to restart Xcode.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkD11.png" alt="Xcode&#39;s Project Navigator"  I'm using Xcode 7.2.1 (7C1002) on an OSX El Capitan 10.11.3 machine.  <answer232682> I am experiencing the same issue with Xcode 7 (all versions). I have to relaunch the Xcode project to correct the highlighting.  <answer250084> This happens if you lower your brightness in the display...increase it and it will be fixed...  <answer263094> It's just a bug which happens sometimes in Xcode, still happening in 8.1.  You don't have to restart to fix it, you can just hide and show the navigator by clicking this button twice:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jLbmD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer294470> In my case I was using multiple tabs. I just closed all the tabs leaving only one opened.  It's a very dangerous bug, it reverted my info.plist file to an older version.  <comment281665> Incidentally, I'm having this issue as well. I suspect it may be a graphical bug. <comment281757> Have you discovered any way of getting it back to normal without restarting XCode? <comment281771> Unfortunately, no. I find that clicking around for a bit has a chance of solving the problem, but I may be mistaken <comment309539> Using 7.3.1. Same problem. ggwp Apple. <comment310395> Welcome to Ask Different.

Selecting a different tab in the navigator (such as Find) and then going back to the Project tab seems to temporarily resolve the issue, but I haven't been able to figure out what causes it or how to permanently resolve it. <comment319013> I just discovered that resizing the navigator pane also appears to resolve the problem (again, just temporarily). <comment331662> Also happening with me on 8.1. Usually it happens after selecting a storyboard file. <comment331663> @DielsonSales if you can reproduce it you should file a bug report with Apple
