LilyPond on Lion <body> Did you succeed in installing LilyPond on Lion? How?  After downloading the (precompiled) LilyPond, I am getting: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4SXoU.png" alt="Lilypond-error"  In plain text:     LilyPond Error      An unexpected error has occurred during execution of the main script      ImportError:   dlopen(/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/objc/_objc.so,   2): Symbol not found: _objc_sync_notify      Referenced from:   /Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/objc/_objc.so   Expected in: /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib   And yet I duly have:     ls -l /usr/lib/libobjc*      -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  1997152 21 Jul 01:27 /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib      lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       15 21 Jul 01:28 /usr/lib/libobjc.dylib - libobjc.A.dylib   <answer30008> The problem is solved in the development version, download from LilyPond Development Page and use at own risk.  <comment34404> The problem is not that the file is not there, it is that a "symbol" (code entry point) is no longer there. <comment34408> I have not successfully gotten LilyPond to run on Lion. <comment34411> @Daniel: I wish they wouldn't just write "for OS X 10.4 and above". It's a little bit too optimistic. <comment34412> @JasonSalaz ..So I guess I should have written otool -X /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib . Except that none of the switches I tried in the place of -X would reveal the symbols in a dylib. Anyway, I don't doubt that the symbol in question is indeed missing. <comment34435> Indeed, LilyPond 2.15.16 works fine on Lion. And it is already compiled, despite being from the development branch.
