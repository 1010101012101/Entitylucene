Where can I find "Install Mac OS X Lion" in the App Store? <body> I'm trying to follow the directions on the Apple Support Page regarding Mass Deployment  Step 2 of the process says      On the server, install the app named "Install Mac OS X Lion" from the Mac App Store (a network connection is required for this process).   The problem here is that when I do a search for codeInstall Mac OS X Lion/code in the App Store, I get no results found.  Where can I find this app in order to enable me to do mass deployment of OS X Lion across my network?  <answer36014> What you're probably looking for is a copy of the strongOS X Lion installer/strong. If you saved a copy when you first installed Lion, great. If not, you'll need to re-download it from the Mac App Store.  ol liLaunch the App Store and kbd&#x2325;/kbd-click the Purchases tab. An "Install" button should appear next to Lion. Click it to re-download the installer./li liOnce the installer finishes downloading, go to your Applications folder to find the installer itself. It is called strongInstall Mac OS X Lion/strong./li /ol  Further steps to get the DMG image:  ol liRight-click the installer and choose codeShow Package Contents/code from the contextual pop-up. /li liNavigate to code.../Contents/SharedSupport/code. There you'll find a disk image called codeInstallESD.dmg/code./li /ol  <answer36016> I still see "Mac OS X Lion" on the homepage of the Mac App Store. Can't you see it there?  Did you try to search strongMac OS X Lion/strong or strongLion/strong?  hr  You can re-download Lion from the App Store by clicking on "Purchase" with the kbdalt/kbd key pressed. Only then will you be able to download. Otherwise, it's just noted as "installed".  hr  Do you use the Mac App Store app and not the App Store from iTunes?  <comment41077> So maybe their language is wrong on the tutorial? I was looking for an app called `Install OS X Lion` where you're saying I should *install* an app called `OS X Lion`... is that right? <comment41080> Yes. The confusion is that the download is called **Install Mac OS X Lion.app** whereas the name in the Mac App Store is **OS X Lion**.
