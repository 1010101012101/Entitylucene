Is "Quit others" possible? <body> If one holds down kbdOption/kbd and kbdControl/kbd whilst clicking an icon in the Dock, the resulting menu contains a strongHide Others/strong command, such that only the clicked application is visible on screen. This is helpful when making a presentation, recording a screencast, or in other circumstances. The one problem is that the programs running in the background can still generate errors, etc., that might awkwardly cause them to reappear during the screencast, presentation, etc.  Would it be possible to create some sort of command (or Service, or something) to "Quit Others" -- that is, a command that would quit all applications except the frontmost one?  <answer43917> There is an answer on SO about this Quit All Applications using Applescript? with code for an AppleScript that can quit all applications. I would guess it just needs to be modified to check what the active application is and then installed as a service on the Mac. There is an article about the latter available here.  <answer43922> Using the SO answer referenced by Diago, maybe something like the following modification can exclude the currently active application:  precodetell application "System Events"     set the visible of every process to true     set app_name to name of the first process whose frontmost is true end tell set white_list to {"Finder", app_name} try     tell application "Finder"         set process_list to the name of every process whose visible is true     end tell     repeat with i from 1 to (number of items in process_list)         set this_process to item i of the process_list         if this_process is not in white_list then             tell application this_process                 quit             end tell         end if     end repeat on error     tell the current application to display dialog "An error has occurred!" &amp; return &amp; "This script will now quit" buttons {"Quit"} default button 1 with icon 0 end try /code/pre  Then you can add this as a service using Automator, and assign a keyboard shortcut for it in the Keyboard section of System Preferences.  <comment49917> @Matt Swain, did you just put together this post, or is there an error somewhere in the system? Because I was just trying to answer my own question, following Diago's lead, and when I clicked submit, this answer appeared, but attributed to you. But either we wrote the same thing, which is entirely possible, I suppose, or somehow my post got attributed to someone else. <comment49923> @DanielL Yeah I wrote this post - can't see your post, but if like you say it was very similar to this, then maybe it was automatically filtered? Weird. <comment49927> OK, wow, you used a different variable name than I did. What you called `appname` I called `current_process`. We just had the same idea. Well, well done.
