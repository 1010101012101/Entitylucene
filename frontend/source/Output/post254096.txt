Prevent app from using bluetooth <body> Applications that have access to the microphone automatically engage, and have to wait for, the hands-free calling system of my car, when Bluetooth is connected. Applications using the car's hands-free system in this way include Siri, System dictation, Voice Memo, and Google Translate.  The problem is that voice dictation works much more quickly and more accurately if I can talk into the handset. I like it when phone calls are routed to the hands-free system, but unfortunately none of my videos or music plays out of the car stereo, but anytime I activate an application that uses the microphone, it defaults to using the hands-free system.  Is there a way to configure bluetooth access to these applications?

You can't 'de-activate' a specific app to not use hands-free bluetooth connection.
