ICS added to OSX Calendar, accept buttom available, but "AcceptÂ¨" not sent to Organizer <body> I have figured out how to add Calendar Events sent to me via email as ICS archives AND showing the accept/decline option in Calendar (this is done by going to Contacts, selecting your own Card and making it "your Card" on the top options, while having your email address in which you received the ICS as your email in that Card).  But, when I "Accept" the meeting (showing in it 2 guests as accepted with a green tick, the organizer who sent it to me and myself), that Acceptance does NOT get sent to the organizer and so he doesn't know I have accepted it.  How can that be and how do I fix it? Thanks everyone in advance!
