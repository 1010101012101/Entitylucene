Fatal error after brew update interrupted <body> While my system was performing a code$ brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade/code we had a power failure and my iMac shut down while updating packages/dependancies.  After rebooting I tried to run code$ brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade/code again and encountered the following error:     fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/': transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining      Error: Failure while executing: git pull -q origin refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master   code$ brew doctor/code strangely returns a clean bill of health.  <answer100373> Solved. The problem was running code$ brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade/code together.  It was causing some kind of Git formula conflict.  I ran code$ brew update/code and then code$ brew upgrade/code, formulae were updated and all is good.  Am now able to run both together again.
