"Picture Calendar" themed iPhoto calendar six-photo layout orientation <body> I am trying to make a calendar in iPhoto '09 (8.1.2) in OS X 10.8.5, using the Picture Calendar theme, and it has decided to give December a vertical (sometimes called "portrait" by the unwashed) layout, and give November a horizontal one.  strongDecember vertical/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rUfKT.png" alt="December vertical"  strongNovember horizontal/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uGdHA.png" alt="November horizontal"  strongMy question/strong How can I tell iPhoto to make December like November, or vice versa?   strongWhat I've tried/strong I tried, for example, dragging and dropping a horizontal photo into the big vertical slot in December but iPhoto stupidly heavily cropped it instead of changing the layout to allow for a big horizontal photo. Context-clicking and telling iPhoto to "Fit photo to frame size" just puts white bars at the top and bottom of the tall vertical frame.
