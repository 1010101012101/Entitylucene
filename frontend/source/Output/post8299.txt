How do I make an AppleScript file into a Mac App? <body> I have an Applescript that simply opens a Dialog Box, asks for a user input and runs a Terminal Command and spits out the answer. It works great in AppleScript Editor yet I am trying to work out how I could package this Script File along with an icon to make a Mac App for my personal use. Thoughts.  <answer8300> In Applescript editor File-Save As and choose File Format as Application.  Open Bundle Contents drawer and see the applet.icns file, copy your icon to that.  See "Saving a script as an application" in Applescript Editor help.  <answer135366> Open the information window for your Application codecmd+i/code and drag your icon file (codeicns/code format) onto the top left default icon.  <answer234254> to export an an application, do strongFile - Export/strong and set the drop-down list to "emApplication/em"  <answer255593> In El Capitan at least you can use codeosacompile/code, e.g:     osacompile -o MyScript.app MyScript.scpt   <comment8950> +1, but +2 if I could. I've been using Applescript for years and had no idea about the icon trick. Very slick. <comment318321> Under El Capitan this seems to be File-Export now.
