Set Keystroke for Service from Terminal <body> I created some services to be used in Finder. Now I wanted to create some keystrokes to call these services. That would be easy in the System Settings, however, I would like to add them from the command line in order to automate this setup.  I tried the following which did allow me not trigger the services by a keystroke:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "label-red" = "$@1"; "label-green" = "$@2"; "label-none" = "$@0"; }' /code/pre  Any ideas to make this work? Instead of codecom.apple.Finder/code I might have to use another identifier, but which?  <answer79663> You can use codePlistBuddy/code and codedefaults/code:  code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Delete NSServicesStatus:"(null) - test2 - runWorkflowAsService"' ~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist 2&gt;/dev/null;defaults write pbs NSServicesStatus -dict-add '"(null) - test2 - runWorkflowAsService"' '{key_equivalent = "^~@2";}'/code  The codePlistBuddy/code command is not needed if there is not an existing entry for the service. Replace codetest2/code with the name of the service. Quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.  code^~@2/code is control-option-command-2. See http://osxnotes.net/keybindings.html.
