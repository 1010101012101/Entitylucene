mDNSResponder not logging <body> codeman mDNSResponder/code suggests that codesudo killall -USR1 mDNSResponder/code will enable warning and notice logging, and that codesudo syslog -c mDNSResponder -d/code will enable log levels Emergency to Debug. Additionally codesudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder/code should dump current state to code/var/log/system.log/code.  None of these have any effect on macOS Sierra. None of the commands fail, but they don't actually log anything in code/var/log/system.log/code either.  <answer257767> In my opinion parts of the log system of macOS 10.12.0 are flawed.  The output (dump) of codesudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder/code is visible in the emDevices  $hostname/em  "log" though.  First launch Console and choose your host device in the left pane. Enter a filter like emmDNS/em in the search field at the top.  Then enter  codesudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder/code in Terminal and watch the results fly past in Console.
