make, gcc and other developer tools unavailable after installing XCode on Lion <body> I installed XCode after I upgraded to OS X Lion, I downloaded XCode from the App Store. codegcc/code, codemake/code and such are still not found and I cannot compile anything from source because of this. I did a codefind / -name make/code and it looks like it found something:  precode/Developer/Library/Xcode/Project Templates/Framework &amp; Library/JNI Library/make /Developer/usr/bin/make /code/pre  What's going on here? Is this normal?  <answer18146> Is code/Developer/usr/bin/code in your PATH variable?  You could try codeln -s /Developer/usr/bin/make /usr/bin/make/code  <answer18147> Make sure that your system's code$PATH/code has been updated. If you had a terminal window open before you installed, and are using the same one now that you have Xcode installed, open a new one and let it run through .bashrc/.bash_profile/etc again to update the path. If you know the specific file that the $PATH variable lives in on your system, you can also just run codesource/code on that file.  If that doesn't work, you can manually add the path that the codefind/code command finds these tools at (should be code/Developer/usr/bin/code) to your code$PATH/code inside code~/.bashrc/code or code~/.bash_profile/code (depending on how your bash files are configured â€” mine has everything in code~/.bashrc/code but I've customized them heavily).  <answer18651> Yeah, looks like Apple has moved all the Developer Tools under /Developer. Why, beats me. Fixing the $PATH is easy, but the annoying part is that the includes have also moved under /Developer/usr/include etc.  I spent a good half a day trying to compile some PHP extensions, to no avail, running into all sorts of "blah.h not found" errors.  <answer19761> Finally figured this out. They're under /Developer because installing Xcode from App Store does not install Xcode, but an app named "Install Xcode". After running it, everything went back to normal. :)  <comment19813> Damn, beat me by seconds. Upvoted for speed! lol <comment19814> @Bryson Woo! Score! <comment20955> i just had my WTF!? moment, too. thanks for clarifying things ... <comment29949> This is usually a bug in Xcode 4.1 only - especially for people with custom shells. Have you verified this still happens after running the latest Xcode 4.1.1?
