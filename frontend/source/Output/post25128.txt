OS X: Is there an open source screen recorder? <body> I need a screen recorder. However, I try to avoid using closed-source software whenever possible except from major vendors like Apple and Skype.   I am wondering, is there an open source screen recorder for Mac OS X?   Or if not, does Apple include such a thing with the OS? Or how about using Skype? I'm running Snow Leopard.  <answer25232> You've answered your own question, but I thought I would flesh it out a bit.    You are correct that QuickTime will record a window, or the whole screen, but it only does so with the version of QT that ships with Lion. It wasn't available in earlier versions of QT or OS X (I'm not sure if the latest QT would do this on an older OS - I don't have one to try it on.)  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it now had that functionality - there really aren't any other free or low cost options.  <answer49824> VLC is an open source media player which also offers screen capture facilities (via File - Open Capture Device..).  <answer141309> h2Open Source/h2  ul lijScreenRecorder GPL, java-based screen recorder./li liVLC has this as a feature and it's great for playback, streaming and transcoding./li liCapture Me/li /ul  h2Closed Source/h2  ul liJing is great for making screencasts and taking screenshots.

You could also flag your comment and see if a moderator can move it to an answer. I'm not sure they can do that, but it shouldn't hurt to try... <comment29396> QuickTime in Snow Leopard also recorded the screen <comment57038> @Mithras May I ask why you've edited your question to remove the parts that make it specific to screen recording? The question is now extremely vague... <comment116192> This only gives the option for the FaceTime camera. What version of VLC are you using? <comment116864> It looks like the feature was removed at some point in the last year. I'd suggest Quicktime's built-in screen recording feature. See "Record your screen" on [this Apple support page](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4024). <comment166529> Which of these are open source? <comment314736> non cnet link, please? uBlock even warned me about it. <comment336924> @AlexGittemeier, You need to select `Screen` for the dropdown where `Input Devices` is showing.
