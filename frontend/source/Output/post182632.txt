How can I turn off receiving SMS (not iMessages) on os x mavericks? <body> Is there any way to turn off receiving SMS on Mavericks but still get iMessages? I find it a security flaw for SMS code login for secure websites, if somebody gains access to my computer they could also login to these sites.   <answer182636> SMS Handoff is not a feature on Mavericks, it needs Yosemite to functionbr [Thanks to @tubedogg for the confirmation]  To enable it you would start from your iPhoneâ€¦br Settings  Messages  Text Message Forwarding - then add your computer from the list by switching on.  That will send a code to the computer, which you then enter on your phone to confirm the function - afaik, Mavericks will never receive that number, only Yosemite.  Switching off isbr Settings  Messages  Text Message Forwarding again &amp; simply turn off forwarding that computer.  <comment217541> You're correct, SMS Handoff does not work on Mavericks, only Yosemite. <comment217542> SMS Handoff, the feature you are referring to, is not available on Mavericks. Also, if someone has physical access to your computer with malicious intent, I think you probably have bigger issues than just them logging into a website. <comment217543> There is no SMS in iMessages. It uses the iMessage server to send messages (same like Skype). The SMS is a cellular feature (phone to phone), where the text message goes to the Cellular provider. So what about the security problem? <comment217545> Thank you for the confirmation @tubedogg
