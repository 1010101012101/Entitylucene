Localhost Not Working After MacOS Sierra Upgrade <body> I've tried other solutions I've found on StackExchange for this same problem, but must have a unique situation that is still causing problems. I have a hosts file setup as follows:  precode127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost     host.ciaciagi.com 255.255.255.255         broadcasthost ::1                     localhost.localdomain localhost     host.ciaciagi.com fe80::1%lo0             localhost /code/pre  I have httpd.conf setup and the line for LoadModule unique_id_module libexec/apache2/mod_unique_id.so commented out (as others have suggested).  I can ping 127.0.0.1 and get this:  precode$ ping 127.0.0.1 PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.082 ms /code/pre  I've run  precode$ sudo apachectl configtest Syntax OK /code/pre  I checked for a corrupt virtual hosts file. Everything was fine.  Restarting apache shows nothing significant (nothing at all):  precode$ sudo apachectl restart $  /code/pre  Opening a browser and attempting to connect to http://localhost/ (I've tried 3 browsers and their private/incognito windows), I still get "Unable to connect" or its equivalent for the browser.  Any ideas?  <answer267149> People [including me] have had success by swapping   code::1    localhost/code  to  code::1    127.0.0.1/code  though that's in a non-domain setup  worth a shot?  <answer267168> I've found that Apache wasn't loading in my ssl configurations in a way that functioned just fine on El Capitan. After removing the SSL configuration, everything worked just fine. I still don't know why my configtest passed with no problems. The error in the logs was:  precode(48)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:443 [Mon Jan 02 09:57:46.057772 2017] [mpm_prefork:alert] [pid 452] no listening sockets available, shutting down [Mon Jan 02 09:57:46.057779 2017] [:emerg] [pid 452] AH00019: Unable to open logs, exiting /code/pre  <comment335148> Is the web server running at all? <comment335169> How can I tell if it's not running? Restarting shows nothing. The commands for apachectl never return anything to me. @patrix <comment335175> @ChiCgi Check if apache is running: `ps aux | grep "httpd"`. Pinging 127.0.0.1 is unrewarding. You have to `ping localhost` or `ping host.ciaciagi.com`!
