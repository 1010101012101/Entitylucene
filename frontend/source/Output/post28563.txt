Can I add an entry to Dictionary? <body> Is it possible to add an entry to the bundled Japanese-English dictionary?  I'm using Dictionary version 2.2 (155) on OS X Lion.  <answer28594> No: the dictionary files OS Xâ€™ Dictionary app uses are read-only, and Dictionary.app does not support annotations. You can create new dictionaries (though that is not a trivial task), but not modify the existing ones.
