Is my system disk damaged? <body> Recently I couldn't get my Mac (bought in April - 2009) to boot. The hard disk was quite full and honestly speaking I kept ignoring a number of warnings from OS X to 'free up some space'. I have been trying to fix it for the past month, and I have tried a lot based on information available on Internet.  The problems are:  ol liThe startup DVD I have takes me to Disk Utility but it fails to re-install Mac OS X./li liThe disk has errors and they are there even if I erased the disk completely./li licodefsck -fy/code is not able to repair the disk./li liI created bootable USB for OS X El Capitan and I used it to boot the Mac: I get to the Apple logo and the progress bar filled up as well (after 1-2 hours)... but nothing happens after that./li /ol  <comment313353> Sounds like trying another HD might be the next step. <comment313368> Are you saying that your Mac won't boot from the USB installer?  Have you tried [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected. <comment313435> Your 1st part of your description is a system disk full. This problem is solved with normal user method: archive old files and remove them. [return] The 2nd part of your description is a damaged disk. Follow the advice from @Allan, and if the test confirm the damage, change your disk. <comment313444> I tried to perform AHT as suggested by Allan but I couldn't get it working. I have already erased the disk so I think I have to somehow install OS X to get AHT to work. I am also missing the 'recovery mode' on my Mac so only option I had was to use a USB.  Thanks! <comment313449> @Allan: Yes, if I use USB as installer, then I get to the apple logo and progress bar, but nothing happens after that. (See point number 4 in my question). Thanks. <comment313470> Does booting up in Safe Mode help? I doubt it would. What about `Command-R` and `Shift-Command-R`? <comment313659> @Brick: no I can't get to safe mode either. I only see 'Internet recovery' but that too fails. :-(
