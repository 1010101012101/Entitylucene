How do I change/delete alias in OS X permanently? <body> I tried to modify/delete alias, but it seems that it is only for the current session by doing this  precodeunalias name /code/pre  or rename it  precodeunalias name='...' /code/pre  Can anyone tell me the way to change/delete it permanently? Thanks!  <answer229887> I just solved it. In order to make permanent change to alias, I need to edit a config file.  precodenano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Than I enter the GNU nano editor window, then I make the change to the line that I want, maybe delete a line or change a line, for example:  precodealias name='/Applications/FunProfile/GoodProgram' /code/pre  Then press control+o to save it, next press control+x+enter to exit it.  <comment280489> Are you asking for advice on OS X? This is not related to "elementary OS" at all then. <comment280490> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this is not an elementary OS specific question. <comment280491> Can you move this to AskDifferent
