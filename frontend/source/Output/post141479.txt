How to restore a hidden file in Time Machine - can't find data file? <body> I followed the instructions in this question but still cannot restore my address book and iCal data. I found what I thought was the data file for the address book, AddressBook-v22.abcddb, but when I tried to import it, Address Book didn't recognize it as a valid importable file. What is the filename of the correct file to import from my TM backup? And I couldn't find anything that looked like an iCal data file.  My back story is that my hard drive crashed on my iMac, and I brought home a new Macbook Air to replace it. I'm just trying to copy my Address Book and Calendar data from my external hard drive backup to the Macbook.  <answer162841> Open Applescript Editor, in Applications  Utilities then copy/paste this to a new script...  precodeset newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES" try     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState   tell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every Finder window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view          end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Then Save as an application, which you can then just double-click to toggle showing/hiding invisible files.  You don't need to kill the Finder for this toggle, a refresh is sufficient - &amp; faster.  <comment166734> Can you add the link you mention in the first line? <comment166737> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141321/how-to-restore-a-hidden-file-in-time-machine
