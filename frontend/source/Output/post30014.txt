Is it possible to run a shell script when the iChat online status changes on Lion? <body> I had a script under Snow Leopard that would upload a tiny file to my server when I launched iChat to reflect my status on my website. For some reason it doesn't work anymore in Lion.  Is there a way to trigger a shell script on online/offline status change in 10.7 without even launching iChat?  <answer30029> Option 1: run a script like this every minute or so with cron or launchd:  precode#!/bin/bash  cd=~/Library/Caches/me.lri.scripts mkdir -p $cd cf=$cd/ichatstatuscheck status=$(osascript -e "tell app \"iChat\" to status") [[ -f $cf &amp;&amp; "$status" != $(cat $cf) ]] &amp;&amp; say "$status" echo "$status" &gt; $cf /code/pre  (The script activates iChat every time it's run.)  hr  Option 2: save this as a stay open application in AppleScript Editor:  precoderepeat     tell application "iChat"         set prev to status         delay 5         if status is not prev then do shell script "say " &amp; quoted form of status     end tell end repeat /code/pre  (Also activates iChat every time it gets the status.)  hr  Option 3: use an iChat event handler (thanks Kopischke)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ocqoa.png" alt=""  This worked for me on Lion, but only when iChat was active. (Not when it wasn't and I changed the status from iChat's status bar item — which I guess was the actual problem the OP had.)  <comment34428> Can you clarify what Lion's "on/offline status bubble" is? <comment34432> Where did you get this script? Did you make it yourself? <comment34466> All of these rely on actually launching iChat (via AppleScript, granted, but still) – which OP didn’t want to do. I think OP’s problem is that the status bar item for iChat (aka “iChat status bubble”) does not honor [event handler settings](http://ericstonge.com/projects/ichatscripting/) – these seem to trigger only with iChat.app running. <comment34468> Also, the second option doesn’t need to be run as a stay open application – you can bind a script to the login / logout events (which correspond to online / offline status) right inside iChat preferences (see [previously linked post](http://ericstonge.com/projects/ichatscripting/)).
