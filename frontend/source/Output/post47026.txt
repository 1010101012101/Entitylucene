Does the AppleTV had a place where I can see what's been downloaded to the device? <body> I've been looking through the user interface of the 2012 AppleTV and I can't find a place to see what has been downloaded to the device (e.g. movies or TV shows)--or the progress in-process downloads. I just purchased a season of a TV show and I want to see how many of the episodes have downloaded and to make sure they're downloading, without actually going to watch a show and see what the scrubber bar says.  <answer47042> Nope, the latest versions of the AppleTV have 8GB of storage however the device doesn't allow the user to view or modify anything about the status storage (at least in a stock state).  During the introduction of the first all black AppleTV Steve Jobs said,     People don't want to think about managing storage, they just want to watch movies and TV shows.
