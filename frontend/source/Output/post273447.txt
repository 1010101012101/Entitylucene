How to run Cisco's webex without installing one of their compromised browser plugins? <body> After the reports of the emhuge/em security flaws in Cisco's Webex browser plugins, I've uninstalled all of their browser plugins and would rather run it directly from the command line.  I've figured out that the following emseems/em to work for me but it's really brittle:  precode"$HOME/Library/Application Support/WebEx Folder/T31_TC/Training Center.app/Contents/MacOS/Training Center" /code/pre  The big question is how the browser plugins injects the name of the conference or how my authentication information into the WebEx application.  ul liIt doesn't seem to be through environmental variables at least.  /li liI can't get dtruss to work with it to see what files it is opening./li /ul  Anyone figured this out?  Thanks much if so.   strongEDIT:/strong  Aha.  I see the following file that seems to hold a bunch of params.  precode"$HOME/Library/Application Support/WebEx Folder/T31_TC/webexparameters.txt" /code/pre  I see the following entries there:  ul liPlaintext password (not really _secret).  More Cisco security prowess: br / code[NAME]-=-oneclickoption-=-[VALUE]-=-4%_secret-=-/code/li liThe conference name in many, many places.  One is: br / code[NAME]-=-szsiteurl-=-[VALUE]-=-https://companyname.webex.com/conferencename/k2-=-/code/li liPlaintext email address in many places./li /ul  Anyone else gotten farther than I?  <comment343786> Honestly, if I was forced to use WebEx I'd fire up a virtual machine and run it in there. <comment343809> Yeah not a bad idea @py4on. <comment343810> Obviously for full effect you need to treat that VM as disposable and not store anything of value on it.
