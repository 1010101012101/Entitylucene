Automate setup of Win7 VPN, including registry settings and security policy changes <body> After numerous difficulties I have managed to get a Windows 7 machine to connect to OSX Server's VPN.  I am looking to automate the setup process for Win 7 clients, which would include:  ol liadd one registry key/li lichange couple security policy settings/li liconfigure a VPN connection (import a VPN profile??)/li /ol  First 2 items above are per OS X Server: How to connect to VPN service from Windows article.  Is there a way to automate the setup so it is a single operation that can be performed by the user as opposed to me having to walk through all the steps on every machine?  <answer225560> Here are some links on the Connection Manager to setup VPN connection and deployment to users.  https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc752995(v=ws.10).aspx  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2693643  https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd672647(v=ws.10).aspx  <comment273746> Additional link: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd672647(v=ws.10).aspx <comment273747> If you want to add additional info to your answer, do it with the [edit] button.
