Moving the focused window to the bottom/top monitor with a shortcut <body> Short version:  Is there a program that can move the focused/active window to the bottom/top monitor with a keyboard shortcut?  hr  Long version:  Sometimes I need to move a window to the bottom/top, in my case between monitors 3 and 4 and between monitors 5 and 6:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q0KTq.png" alt="enter image description here"  I use BetterTouchTool to move a window to the left or right monitor:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pIVrU.png" alt="enter image description here"  But it doesn't have the option to move a window to the monitor up or down.  SizeUp has the same limitation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JP4SB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer162902> h1Moom/h1  You can:  ul liMove &amp; Zoom to Full Screen/li liMove &amp; Zoom to Left Half/li liMove &amp; Zoom to Right Half/li liMove &amp; Zoom to Top Half/li liMove &amp; Zoom to Bottom Half/li liMove &amp; Zoom to Top Left Quarter/li liMove &amp; Zoom to Top Right Quarter/li liMove &amp; Zoom to Bottom Right Quarter/li liMove &amp; Zoom to Bottom Left Quarter/li /ul  Define size and position and assign a shortcut.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cbM2Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  Use a predefined shortcut and then use arrow keys to move the window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o4wrQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Use a shortcut to move the window to another monitor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oCnIA.png" alt="enter image description here"  For the record, Moom is usually 10$, but now is 5$.  <comment190585> Thanks but can Moon move a window from monitor 5 to monitor 6 with a keyboard shortcut for example? From what I can see most features move the window within the same monitor. <comment190587> Can move a window to the monitor on the left, on the right, on the top or on the bottom. I update mi answer with an screenshot. <comment190589> Awesome, thanks! <comment190599> possible duplicate of [What Window Management Options exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x) <comment190682> @Tetsujin Thanks for the pointer.
