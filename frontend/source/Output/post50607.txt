Installing Homebrew: .git already exists <body> I should mention that I have no idea what I am doing :) So, sorry if this is confusing.   I am trying to install Homebrew with this command   precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)" /code/pre  using the directions here https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation  After installing i ran codebrew doctor/codeas it said to, I got these errors:  precode    Error: /usr/local/include isn't writable. This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn't managed by Homebrew.  If a brew tries to write a header file to this directory, the install will fail during the link step.  You should probably `chown` /usr/local/include Error: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig isn't writable. This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn't managed by Homebrew.  If a brew tries to write a .pc file to this directory, the install will fail during the link step.  You should probably `chown` /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig Error: /usr/local/share isn't writable. This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn't managed by Homebrew.  If a brew tries to write a file to this directory, the install will fail during the link step.  You should probably `chown` /usr/local/share Error: Some directories in /usr/local/share/man aren't writable. This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn't managed by Homebrew. If a brew tries to add locale information to one of these directories, then the install will fail during the link step. You should probably `chown` them:      /usr/local/share/man     /usr/local/share/man/man1 Error: The /usr/local directory is not writable. Even if this directory was writable when you installed Homebrew, other software may change permissions on this directory. Some versions of the "InstantOn" component of Airfoil are known to do this.  You should probably change the ownership and permissions of /usr/local back to your user account. Error: You have no /usr/bin/cc. This means you probably can't build *anything*. You need to install the Command Line Tools for Xcode. You can either download this from http://connect.apple.com or install them from inside Xcode's Download preferences. Homebrew does not require all of Xcode! You only need the Command Line Tools package! Error: Unbrewed dylibs were found in /usr/local/lib. If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.  Unexpected dylibs:     /usr/local/lib/libavcodec.52.11.0.dylib    /usr/local/lib/libavcodec.52.dylib    /usr/local/lib/libavcodec.dylib    /usr/local/lib/libavformat.52.25.0.dylib    /usr/local/lib/libavformat.52.dylib    /usr/local/lib/libavformat.dylib    /usr/local/lib/libavutil.49.14.0.dylib    /usr/local/lib/libavutil.49.dylib    /usr/local/lib/libavutil.dylib Error: Your compilers are different from the standard versions for your Xcode. If you have Xcode 4.3 or newer, you should install the Command Line Tools for Xcode from within Xcode's Download preferences. Otherwise, you should reinstall Xcode. Error: /usr/bin occurs before /usr/local/bin This means that system-provided programs will be used instead of those provided by Homebrew. The following tools exist at both paths:      idle     idle2.5     pydoc     pydoc2.5     python     python-config     python2.5     python2.5-config     pythonw     pythonw2.5     smtpd.py     smtpd2.5.py  Consider amending your PATH so that /usr/local/bin is ahead of /usr/bin in your PATH. Error: Your Xcode is configured with an invalid path. You should change it to the correct path. Please note that there is no correct path at this time if you have *only* installed the Command Line Tools for Xcode. If your Xcode is pre-4.3 or you installed the whole of Xcode 4.3 then one of these is (probably) what you want:      sudo xcode-select -switch /Developer     sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer  DO NOT SET / OR EVERYTHING BREAKS! /code/pre  In trying to fix these errors, I ran  codegit clean -n/code  codegit clean -df/code  codegit init/code then codegit clean -df again/code.  So then when I ran codebrew doctor/codeagain, it said code-bash: /usr/local/bin/brew: No such file or directory/code.   After that, I tried to reinstall Homebrew but now I get code/usr/local/.git already exists!/code.  So, how do I fix these problems and get Homebrew installed?   Thanks in advance and sorry for my confusion.   <answer50611> When you ran codegit clean -df/code, you deleted all of Homebrew (and... anything else located in /usr/local), hence why you were unable to run codebrew/code any further. But since you initialized a git repository, codebrew/code can't re-install itself.  Run coderm -rfv /usr/local/.git/code, then;  code/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"/code  That should do the trick.
