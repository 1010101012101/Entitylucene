iPhone 3GS switches from 3G to EDGE after a GSM call <body> My title says it all. Now to get back the 3G network after a call, I need to go to Settings  Network and turn 3G off and back on.   I'm fed up doing this every time after a normal call. My EDGE connection is damn slower than the 3G one. So I can't keep using EDGE.   The above stated problem happends around 8/10 times. The probability is more when the duration of the call is more. Also, when I am using Personal Hotspot and connecting to the net through my laptop and a phone call (GSM) arrives, I can continue to browse for a while  into the call and again the above mentioned problem appears.  GSM and 3G are on separate frequency bands, so both call and internet should work reliably and simultaneously. I am not sure whats going wrong. Is it the problem with my service provider or the phone?
