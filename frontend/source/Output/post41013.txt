Is there a way Spotlight indexes my Skim bookmarks/notes ? <body> I find Skim is a great pdf file reader and want to spend a great deal of time adding notes and bookmarks to some of the pdf files I have.   I know Spotlight indexes pdf files but it doesn't seem to index my Skim bookmarks.  (I just created a bookmark in Skim and search for that bookmark in Spotlight. No results).  I may force Spotlight to index net.sourceforge.skim-app.skim.bookmarks.plist (it is where bookmarks are stored) ?  What do you think ?  Thanks in advance.  <answer41031> From what I know, the developer who made Skin will have to add the support to be searched in Spotlight themselves, as they have to create a spotlight importer (basically, a plugin) in order for spotlight to look at things inside unsupported filetypes.  <answer105336> The solution I've found+tested:  In Skim:     ul   liFile - Export - Skim notes./li   liYou now have one .skim file with your annotations only + their pages number. /li   /ul   Skim notes are indexed by Spotlight.

It might just take time for Spotlight to index the files. <comment47310> I created two bookamrks. Two days later I searched for them using spotlight. No answer.
