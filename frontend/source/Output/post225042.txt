How to add shortcut for Insert Equation in PowerPoint 2016? <body> PowerPoint 2016 for Mac finally includes the new-style equation editor (which was already available in Word for Mac and PowerPoint for Windows).  An equation can be inserted using a ribbon button (Insert → Insert Equation).  strongHow can I add a keyboard shortcut for this?/strong  Is there already a keyboard shortcut for it?  For Word I could use the OS settings from System Preferences → Keyboard and set up a shortcut for the menu item named "Equation".  But I cannot find a corresponding menu item in PowerPoint.  I can only find this feature on the ribbon, but not the in menu.  Is there any way to set up a keyboard shortcut for it?  <answer264330> This shortcut is already in PowerPoint: kbd⌘/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbd=/kbd   This produces a place to type an equation when you are in a text box.  <answer296276> You can't post keyboard shortcuts into comments, so I added an answer. I found out about the German keyboard shortcut (by trial and error). It is:  kbd⌘/kbdkbdalt/kbdkbd´/kbd  So, on a German keyboard the equals sign has to be replaced with an apostrophe (the key next to the backspace key (on its left)) @Daniel  <comment331280> Indeed it works. But how did you figure it out? I searched for so long for this. It's not [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-in-PowerPoint-2016-for-Mac-f25f92b3-b0a8-4c60-aec8-954b72aa81ad). <comment343168> Are you aware of any documentation pages that show this shortcut? Or any other way to discover it?  Your post is still the only mention I could find on the internet. <comment356425> I discovered the mode by accident when I was trying to do something else. I hope they don't take it away. Lovely Microsoft. <comment362767> This appears to work only with US keyboard layout :-( Any idea about a German keyboard?
