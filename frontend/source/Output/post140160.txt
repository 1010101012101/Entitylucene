Alternative to AlwaysAppendSearchDomains on Yosemite? <body> Since Lion, I have used the AlwaysAppendSearchDomains trick on mDNSresponder to resolve names with dots in search domains.   In yosemite this doesn't work any more. In fact, mDNSresponder doesn't seem to be running:  precode$ ps ax | grep -i dns | grep -v grep $ /code/pre  <answer140162> I found the answer as I posted this:  To enable mDNSResponder, edit /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist and remove the lines   precode&lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  Then add -AlwaysAppendSearchDomains to the arguments list further down in the same file:  precode&lt;string&gt;_mdnsresponder&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-AlwaysAppendSearchDomains&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  Finally run   precode$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist $ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist /code/pre  You can then verify mDNSResponder is running:  precode$ ps ax | grep -i dns | grep -v grep 10456   ??  Ss     0:00.44 /usr/sbin/mDNSResponder -AlwaysAppendSearchDomains /code/pre  Subdomains of search domains can then be resolved.  <comment172034> It looks like `mDNSResponder` has been replaced by `discoveryd` in the latest Yosemite DP. Any idea how to achieve that with the new subsystem? <comment177791> @cassianoleal, I, too, am curious about this. I [posted a follow-up question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151101/discoveryd-alternative-to-replace-mdnsresponder-argument) asking essentially the same thing. Here's hoping that the only option isn't to have to type FQDNs. <comment213780> Also wanting to know how to achieve this with `discoveryd`
