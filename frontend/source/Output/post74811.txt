Can I "play higher rated songs more often" in iTunes 11? <body> After upgrading to iTunes 11, I miss the "Play higher rated songs more often" feature available in iTunes DJ from previous versions. Is there a simple way to restore this feature? I used to use a complex series of smart playlists like The Ultimate Smart iTunes Playlist before this feature came around. I suppose I could do that again, but I'd rather have something simpler.  <answer91072> One not very simple way:  ol licreate smart playlists for various ratings./li liCreate a simple playlist./li liDrag and drop the smart playlist into the simple playlist.  Drag the 5* list 5 times, the 4 star list 4 times, and the 3 star list three times./li /ol  This will NOT automatically update the simple playlist.  <comment95869> I think the only way to do it is to use smart playlists. <comment103380> They took this feature away as punishment because nobody was using Ping. :(
