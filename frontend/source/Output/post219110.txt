Two external keyboards of the same type have different mappings <body> I use the Logitech K750 on my MBP at work and also bought the keyboard for myself to work at home with the same laptop (German PC layout!).br The problem is that strongone/strong of the keyboards will always have the code^/code and code&lt;/code keys swapped:  ol licodesudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist/code to reset the mapping/li liPlug in the K750 at work, select mapping: everything works fine/li liCome home, plug in K750, select mapping: code^/code and code&lt;/code keys are swapped./li licodesudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist/code to reset the mapping/li liPlug in K750 again, select mapping: everything is fine/li liCome to work, plug in K750, select mapping: code^/code and code&lt;/code keys are swapped./li liStart from code1./code/li /ol  The behavior is super annoying and I can't get my head wrapped around what is causing the issue because it's the exact same keyboard-type.br What is wrong with my keyboards?  <answer223699> I'm not familiar with what you are trying, but I've had success with Karabiner for device-specific remaps, it's a little complicated to use but they have a manual on their site  <comment265359> What is the mapping (keyboard type) which you are selecting each time?
