How do I temporarily disable or mute Messages (iMessage) on OS X? <body> I use Apple's iMessage across several devices, including my (OS X Lion) strongMac/strong, using the recent Messages beta.  However, the application has some undesired behaviour.  When I quit Messages, it will relaunch itself when I receive new messages. This is incredibly distracting.  Is there a way to emtemporarily/em disable or mute iMessage (including the badge on the Dock) from strongemjust my Mac?/em/strong I'd still like to receive messages on my other iOS devices.  <answer52997> On the Messages menubar, go to emMessages- Accounts/em and uncheck iMessages.  <answer103880> In Messages, unselect the "Use Alerts in this Conversation" option in the View menu. This should enable iMessages without the sounds.  <answer146741> An update for Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). You can turn on Do Not Disturb in Notification Centre to mute notifications:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnYGV.png" alt="notification centre -  do not disturb screenshot"  You can show Notification Centre by clicking on the three-horizontal-lines icon on the far-right of the menubar, or perhaps by doing a two-finger swipe from the right edge of your trackpad (if this gesture is enabled in System Preferences - Trackpad - More Gestures). Then swipe up to reveal the 'Do Not Disturb' toggle (which is hidden at the top of the notification centre panel).  Update: I've also just discovered that you can option-click on the Notification centre menubar icon to toggle emDo Not Disturb/em mode on and off.  <answer159977> Click your apple symbol in the computer - System preferences - notifications -  messages - none   <comment60593> Why do you want to disable the app and not just remove it? <comment60596> I enjoy using the app, it's helpful, and I'm a frequent user of the iMessage service. But there are times when I need to get some work done, and the frequent sounds, badges, and dock bounces aren't helping my concentration. <comment60597> This solutions works. Many thanks! <comment139988> I like this option to mute that person basting you with messages. (Thanks for the edit @patrix) <comment186036> This is much better than having to disable iMessage every time and also keeps messages that come in while muted in iMessage which doesn't happen when it's disabled. <comment189528> UPDATE: New notification center settings enable this functionality. <comment287736> This should be the new answer.
