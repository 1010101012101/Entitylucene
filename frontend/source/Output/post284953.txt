Workflow does not finish when initiated by dictation command <body> I created the following script to open up the dictation commands editor in system preferences. It works when I run it from within automator, but when I use a dictation command to initiate the workflow, it gets stuck after revealing the "Accessibility" pane. Any ideas?  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     reveal pane "Accessibility" end tell  tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     delay 1     select table 1 of scroll area 2 of window 1     delay 1     select row 14 of table 1 of scroll area 2 of window 1     delay 0.5     click button 2 of window 1 end tell /code/pre  <answer284957> I had to give permission to "Dictation" setting under to System Preferences - Security &amp; Privacy - Accessibility to get this to work.
