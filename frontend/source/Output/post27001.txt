I need a delete button <body> I also have an azerty keyboard, but am used to the qwerty and I want to know how I can modify the keyboard to have a "delete" function. Deleting using the backspace is laborious and I miss being able to delete from the front of the text. Any ideas?   <answer27003> you can use KeyRemap4MacBook to remap CapsLock to delete.  <answer27007> If you have an Apple keyboard: kbdfn-Backspace/kbd is a substitute for kbdDelete/kbd. Depending on the application kbdCtrl-D/kbd works as well.  <comment30911> I'd hit that .) <comment30915> I assume you have some model of MacBook and you are not using an external keyboard. Is that the case? <comment30932> @Eimantas You got me, I Led O L. :)
