Two-page view disabled in iBook for some book <body> I've purchased a book from the iBooks Store that has the two-page view mode disabled on my Mac (OSX 10.9 running iBooks 1.01). iBook can show other books in two-page view mode with no problem. But this specific book has almost all menus under "View" greyed out. Is there anyway to fix it? The book seems to be only designed for iPad in vertical mode, and the single-page view mode only takes less than half of my Macbook screen and cannot be zoomed to fill the full screen.
