Mac mail doesn't have the option for calendar when adding a new cPanel email account <body> Previously when I configure Mac mail, there is always an option for calendar so that I can use that email for my company calendar entries. But now in Mac OSX 10.9.1, I don't get that option and I need this so bad. Why this is happening? Can anyone help me find a solution for this please?  I can email you the screenshot if you want because Stack overflow is not allowing me to post images without having 10 rep points.  <comment143064> Are you referring to the Macintosh app "Mail"? What do you mean by "cPanel" email account", cPanel is software used to configure and control web hosting boxes? Is your company calendar using Exchange? <comment143076> Hi, I mean the email is on our own server where we create the email accounts using cPanel and I am trying to add it to Mac mail and cannot seem to have the calendar option. Sorry for not being clear and thanks for helping me. <comment143080> Welcome to Ask Different!
