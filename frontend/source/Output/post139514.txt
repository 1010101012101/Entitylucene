Connecting via AFP with no timeout <body> My Mac at home is asleep, but it sometimes wakes up for various reasons, and I want to connect to it via AFP once it's awake so it will stay awake and let me access files. When I do an AFP connection in Finder with shift+cmd+k, it times out after about 30 seconds. Is there a way to disable the timeout so I can let it keep trying until it can connect?
