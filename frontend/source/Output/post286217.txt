Wheer can I find the number of records for specific entity in new CloudKit Dashboard? <body> In previous version of Dashboard I was able to preview how many records was created by users of my app. But in new dashaboard there is no info about number of created addresses in database. It was very useful for me.  Do I miss sth, or it was dropped by Apple?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAMpQ.png" alt="enter image description here"
