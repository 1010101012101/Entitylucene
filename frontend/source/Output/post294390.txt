Error when overwriting hard drive with terminal <body> precodeTituss-MBP:~ tituswong$ diskutil secureErase freespace 0 /dev/disk1 Started erase on disk1 Macintosh HD Creating a temporary file Securely erasing a file Creating a secondary temporary file Mounting disk Error: -69847: Couldn't create temporary file Underlying error: 1: POSIX reports: Operation not permitted /code/pre  This was the error. I tried sudo but it didn't work. I'm using OS X El Captain anyone know how to fix this please?  <comment371575> are you booting from the same drive you are working on? <comment371577> yeah is there something I can do <comment371578> I think you should boot from another device to be able to complete the operation on the drive. <comment371579> So how exactly do I achieve that, the way I'm doing it is from this article btw -- http://www.macworld.com/article/1139688/os-x/erasefreespace.html <comment371580> And it didn't say I needed to do this kind of stuff <comment371584> The linked article explains how to erase a partition (on an external drive), not the whole disk as you did. Can you still boot into the recovery partition with Cmd-R/Cmd-Opt-R? <comment371585> Well I'm just erasing the free space not the whole disk, I tried doing Cmd-R but in disk utilities there was no erase free space option only erase the whole disk <comment371586> I hope that you had current up-to-date backups before you started as stated in the article. <comment371589> true so how do I get rid of the error <comment371599> Have you tried running the same command just with "sudo" in front.. i.e. run "sudo diskutil secureErase freespace 0 /dev/disk1"? <comment371607> yeah it just gave me the same error but immediately <comment371783> K i guess no one knows
