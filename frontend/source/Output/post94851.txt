Second display not using the correct refresh rate <body> I have a second display at work, and when i plug it in i use a thunderbolt to vga adapter, however it always uses the wrong refresh rate 90hz instead of 60hz, is there a way to stop this from happening? As its getting annoying when i use my secondary display at work and it moves my windows then the other screen appears blank.   <comment111295> I suppose you try : System Preferences  Displays  Displays ? <comment113478> Upgrading to ML seemed to fix this issue :S
