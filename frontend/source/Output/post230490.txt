OS X - TodoApp with shortcut that can popup on any space/desktop? <body> I'm fairly new to the Mac world. I really stronglove/strong the multiple desktop feature.   Unfortunately, every todo application I've tried takes me to the regular desktop when I want to use them, or on their own desktop. I would like to have an app that could pop-up on top of the screen no matter where I am â€“ like Spotlight when I press kbdControl/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd.  I'm not sure it is possible though, since it feels like each app in full screen mode takes control of the whole "shortcut space". But once again, I don't know anything about OS X.  Is it possible, and if so, is there a todo app I could use that would do that ?  <answer230511> Try Wunderlist for Mac. It has a feature called "Mac Quick Add" where you press kbdctrl/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdw/kbd, and you can quickly add a todo with spotlight-like interface, and it works on any active space as long as the app is open.  <answer230532> Things by Cultured Code has a quick entry feature that can be evoked with a keyboard shortcut from anywhere.  Differently from Wunderlist you don't need a subscription for advanced features.  <comment281364> That is exactly what I was looking for, thank you!
