Control Spotify with Media Keys <body> How can I use the media keys (previous track, play/pause, next track) for Spotify instead of iTunes? OS X 10.9.4  <answer143148> You can download Bowtie. Although the developers have stopped developing this app, you can still use it to control Spotify, Rdio, and iTunes with media keys.  <answer143153> If you use the Spotify desktop app, the media keys on OS X work by default (sometimes iTunes randomly "retains" the keys: just reboot). For the best results, don't keep iTunes and Spotify open at the same time.  If you use the Spotify Web Player, you can enable the media keys using BeardedSpice, a free application which enables you to control web-based media players using you keyboard media keys. It also works for YouTube, for example.  <answer181753> The keys didn't work for me on OSX10.10, while they normally do. I launched and quit iTunes. After that, Spotify responded to the media keys again. Even play/pause without launching iTunes. This may be because I tweaked OS X to stop launching iTunes when pressing play/pause (I can't remember for sure.)  Pressing play/pause on a headset does still launch iTunes.  <answer198979> I've found this helper application : Magic Keys ; Graciously written in a generic way by the creator of the Gear music player.  iTunes still sometimes pops us when using a Bluetooth control however, but it's minimal and non-intrusive and works well otherwise.  <answer222646> You can go into System Preference - Users&amp;Groups - Login Items, then disable iTune and Spotify at startup, restart, then start Spotify which triggers Spotify helper to take priority control of the media keys ... Good luck !!!  <answer231257> If iTunes is not running, the media keys will work. I just tried it and it works on my Mac.  <answer283427> If nothing helps to make Spotify take over the keys, check if you have Google Music installed in Chrome apps, because it always takes over these keys. Removing the Chrome app immediately makes media keys to work in Spotify.  <comment168607> Related question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58234/override-itunes-media-keys-play-pause-etc-for-spotify <comment168625> Ok, bowtie worked, but I had to use fn+media keys because them alone didn't work <comment168626> iTunes killed but media keys didn't work. I solved using bowtie <comment168647> Head over `System Preferences » Keyboard` and make sure you don’t use F1, F2, etc as standard keys. <comment233420> This is an answer. BeardedSpice is awesome. Thank you. <comment234217> Works great in Yosemite (10.10.4) <comment284079> Link to BeardedSpice looks like spam now. <comment284080> This is a great solution. Thanks! <comment284142> Ugh. I changed it to the new developer's site on GitHub. <comment308829> I'v posted an answer to this here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58234/override-itunes-media-keys-play-pause-etc-for-spotify?noredirect=1&lq=1 <comment357328> The question is about spotify .... <comment357478> @Matteo better?
