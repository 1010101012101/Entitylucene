Most efficient way of migrating selected elements of user account and selected applications to a new mac <body> I will have to transfer my user account and some other stuff to a new mac and I am currently considering what would be the most efficient way of doing that. The list of things I would like and wouldn't like to transfer is below:  h1To transfer/h1  ul liCurrent user documents/li liEmails/li liPhotos / Music/li liAddress book, preferences settings/li /ul  h2From applications:/h2  ul liPrecisely defined list of applications/li liplus corresponding application preference folders/li /ul  h1Not to transfer/h1  ul liThe whole content of the stronguser folder/strong as I have things that I do not need there. Like embin/em folder with some old stuff, emVirtual Boxes/em, etc./li /ul  hr  What's the best strategy to approach this problem?  ol liClean current account leaving only stuff to transfer? I'm thinking that no matter what I do they will be emorphans/em from software left. Also in the course of years, I made mess using emhomebrew/em and emmacports/em in the same time, instaling various python frameworks, etc./li liInstall new clean account and copy selected things by hand. If this is better, how to efficiently copy selected application with corresponding preference folders?/li /ol  <answer217983> Use Apple's Migration Assistant to copy all of your documents, apps, user accounts, and settings to a new Mac from another computer.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350  <comment263491> I did have a look at this and other discussion but I reckon that there is no way to transfer only selected applications and selected elements from the user account. <comment263493> It's the easiest and fastest way to move a user account from one mac to another without creating problems with missing ~/Library files, corresponding application preference folders etc..  Once you move everything, then spend some time removing the stuff you don't need. In the end, you'll spend less time trouble shooting issues with missing files etc. that might be needed by applications.  I've done this multiple times over the decade that I've owned Macs. <comment263505> Thanks, it's a sound point. So basically, the game plan could be to clean the current account and then move it. <comment263799> @konrad yes, I would clean the current account -- remove apps, files in download directory, etc. -- and then migrate the account.  The question was asking for the "most efficient" method and I think this is the way. <comment263807> Thanks very much for showing the interest and contribution.
