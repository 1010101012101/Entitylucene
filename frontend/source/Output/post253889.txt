Where does Photos.app store its search index? <body> With the new macOS Sierra version of Photos.app you can index your entire photo library and it allows you to search by arbitrary words. As I understand it, this indexing of all the photos (from my iCloud Photo Library) happens on the local Mac itself and not in iCloud. But where does Photos.app store the index it has created? Is the search index shared between all my devices or is it local to each device and each device has to build its own index?   Does anyone have technical details on how this is implemented? I could not find anything related to this.  <comment316045> Faces and object recognition data are local to the device and are not shared, even with multiple devices using the same Apple ID.
