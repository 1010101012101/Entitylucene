Diagnostics & Usage: GPURestart.ips.synced - is my iPad 2 defective? <body> I stumbled upon the Diagnostics&amp;Usage information under General Settings today, and noticed some reports like  precodeGPURestart-2014-06-01-152133.ips.synced GPURestart-2014-06-02-122305.ips.synced GPURestart-2014-06-03-160858.ips.synced /code/pre  What does this mean? I know that GPU means graphics processor. Is it perhaps defective on my iPad 2, or is it more likely to be an app that is causing the issue (e.g. overloading it)? I am running iOS 7.1.1.
