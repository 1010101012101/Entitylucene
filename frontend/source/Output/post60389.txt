Why are there folders in /Users of already deleted users? <body> Some time ago I had a user called "xy" on my system. I have deleted the user but in the code/Users/code directory there are folders called "xy" with a Desktop, Library etc. in it.   Why are they not deleted and can I delete them manually?  <answer60390> What version of OS X are you using?  In Mountain Lion, when you delete a user, you are presented with a dialog with the emoption/em to delete the home folder of the user you are deleting.  It shouldn't be any problem deleting it. It's personal settings and assets stored. Nothing global to the system. Do delete you log in with an administrator account and do one of  ul ligo to code/Users/code in the Finder and delete the "xy" folder/li liopen Terminal and run codesudo rm -rf /Users/xy/code/li /ul  <answer60436> strongTLDR: Deleting this user's home folder will not harm your system. It will, obviously enough, delete any of the files you created when you were logged in as the previous user./strong  hr  strongemHow is it possible that there be a folder for a user who doesn't appear at the login window?/em/strong  OS X keeps track of users and their passwords using Directory Services. On most people's computers the Directory Services files are stored in /var/db/dslocal. This database stores the names of users, and other information, such as the location of their home folder. When you deleted your user, your Mac removed the account entry (from the dslocal database), but did not delete the home folder stored in the /Users folder.  hr  strongemSo why didn't the system automatically delete the home folder when it deleted the user from the database?/em/strong  When you delete a User from System Preferences, you are asked what to do with the home folder itself.

To do so:  ol liin strongSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/strong, create a strongnew account with the exact same name/strong as the old user's home folder.

According to Wikipedia there was *also* a 1920s American pornographic film director by that name. I had no idea.
