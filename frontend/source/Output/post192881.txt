Why can't I execute mysql without the full path? <body> At my terminal, I can't codecd/code to the folder containing codemysql/code and call it.   precodeTimsMacBookAir:/ tim$ cd /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/ TimsMacBookAir:bin tim$ mysql -bash: mysql: command not found /code/pre  If I execute the file by using the whole path, it works  precodeTimsMacBookAir:bin tim$ /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g. Your MySQL connection id is 7 Server version: 5.5.38 Source distribution /code/pre  Why is that?  <answer192886> The current directory is usually not in the codePATH/code variable (the variable contains all the directories where to look for an executable).  If you type codeecho $PATH/code you will see that code./code is not in the semicolon separated list of directories.  <comment229687> Because mysql is not in your PATH variable in which case you need the absolute path to the executable or you can `cd` to the directory where the executable file resides and call it like this-`./mysql` <comment229881> Just use `./mysql` or add `.` to you `PATH`  which is not usually recommended.
