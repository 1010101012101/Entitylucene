Trying to delete Linux partition but getting "Couldn't read partition map" error <body> I partitioned my hard drive to be able to dual boot into Linux for a computer science course I was taking, but am finished with the course and want to reclaim the space and repartition the hard drive. When I go into Disk Utility the partition isn't showing up in the side bar:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MYWus.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then when I go into partition from the top level drive (APPLE SSD SMO2...), select the 40 GB partition, press the minus button, and then hit apply, it gives me this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLLjy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment358162> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show disk0` and `diskutil cs list` entered in Terminal.app **as formatted text** to your question.
