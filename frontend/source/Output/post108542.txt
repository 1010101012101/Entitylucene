How can Finder permanently show a specific file starting with a dot/period? <body> I have a folder on my Mac that I will set up to git-sync with a folder on my web server. I’d like to be able to see the code.htaccess/code file in this folder without having to unhide hidden files all over the system. Is that possible?  I’m using Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).  (Mike Scott mentioned in How to show hidden files and folders in finder? that this might not be possible to show only specific files/folders that start with a dot but it would be nice with a definite answer – and instructions for how to do it, if it is indeed possible.)  <answer108545> Nope. That's a feature.   Either you show all files starting with dots or you hide them all.   codechflags hidden myFile/code can make hide a file but not unhide files hidden because of the dot.   <answer108546> One way to get around this would be to create a symbolic link to code.htaccess/code and call it something without a dot. For example:  precode$ cd site_root $ ln -s .htaccess htaccess /code/pre  Then you can open codehtaccess/code from Finder and you'll actually be editing the code.htaccess/code file.  (You could even make the second command codeln -s .htaccess " .htaccess"/code, which would visually look like code.htaccess/code but be visible because of the leading space.)  <answer108547> If you do not wish to use a symbolic link (which is a good workaround), as mentioned in another answer, you can use the free app invisibliX to toggle the visibility of hidden files quickly or to hide specific files. You can even set your own keyboard shortcut from strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard/strong.  This is easier to use than resorting to the codeTerminal/code to change codeFinder/code settings back and forth.  If you wish to see hidden files in Open/Save dialogs, pressing kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd./kbd (dot/period) would toggle the visibility of files.  <answer129577> But if you don't want to use any additional software and don't want to leave your hidden file(s) or folder(s) visible or yet don't want to have to fixe a specific path every time your change your web dev directory and so on,   In a terminal :  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder /code/pre  to edit the hidden file  and then  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE; killall Finder /code/pre  after editing!  You can create a doubleclic script launcher with Scripteditor e.g.:  precodedo shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE; killall Finder" /code/pre  and export it as Application  <answer147106> I just created this one-liner bash script that creates symbolic links for all dot-files in your home directory. Note that it attempts to create a directory at code~/Dotfiles/code:  precodecd ~; mkdir Dotfiles; for f in .*; do ln -s $f Dotfiles/${f:1}; done; rm Dotfiles/DS_Store; /code/pre  Just paste the line into the Terminal and press kbdEnter/kbd.  <comment127249> I'm assuming you're not using the commandline? You should get start using it `ls -la` and you're good to go :) <comment127250> Great workaround since the answer to the title's question was no. <comment127269> You can also link it to something that _looks_ like a dot; I use `,htaccess` (etc.), but you could play games with unicode if you really, really wanted to. <comment127276> or use a hardlink (`ln .htaccess htaccess`) instead of a soft link... It would be less visible that it is a link, but in some case it's preferable. But in all case, **BE CAREFUL**. I'd be very worried (and not at all surprised) that doing this could lower the security of the website... you really need to dig info about this before you use that solution at all (either symlink/other name/hard link/etc)! <comment127281> @OlivierDulac, you make a good point. Ensure that apache doesn't serve the `htaccess` file (or whatever the link's called), to do so might be a security risk. <comment129807> I do :), especially when I’m working with things related to the site, but just as often I’m in Finder and it’d be convenient to see certain dot-files there too. <comment129809> Oliver, since this is on my local machine I could just tell git to exclude the link from synching to the server, thanks for the legitimate warning though :-). <comment129813> Yes, I saw the `cmd`+`shift`+`.` tip when I was searching for a solution to this, it’s really handy (I already started using it). Thanks for the tip :-). <comment129815> Thanks joerick and Daniel Lawson! I went with the symbolic link, it works like a charm (and it’s excluded from synching with git so it shouldn’t end up on the live server). <comment151657> 'without having to unhide hidden files all over the system' <comment152257> oooooooopsssss!
