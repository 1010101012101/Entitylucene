Can iOS use Wi-Fi to get location even if Wi-Fi is off? <body> On Android, if the user turns Wi-Fi off, the phone will still scan for nearby Wi-Fi access points to help determine the phone's location (discussed in e.g. this article). Does iOS also have this feature?  <answer234030> No.  If Wi-Fi is off, the radio is disabled, and it is no longer augmenting Location Services.  Often, you'll receive a message like the following to alert you to this: img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZCsMvrZ.jpg" alt="Location Accuracy"  <comment285887> Probably not, but I couldn't say for certain.
