Macbook Pro retina 15" mid 2014 slows down when desktop wallpaper is changing <body> I have set my desktop wallpaper to change every minute, as I thought my laptop has enough juice to handle it. Whenever the wallpaper is changing, the computer slows down, although the cpu load does not increase more than ~5%. So if I'm typing something, and the wallpaper is changing at that same moment, the letters appear on the screen a second late. This is really annoying, as I'm typing a lot.  Is there supposed to be such a visible slow-down (even when the cpu load does not change visibly)? And if not, what can I do to fix it?  (OS X 10.10.5, retina 15" mid 2014, the default iris pro model)  <comment242642> It's probably the graphics card that's struggling to do the compositing during the transition. Simple fix is just 'don't do it' ;) <comment242690> @Tetsujin I'll disable it if I have to, but it sounds stupid when they have an option for changing it every 5 seconds when most of their models have onboard gpus. <comment242691> Features always work best on the latest & greatest - the rest of us have to pick & choose which to enable. <comment242725> @Tetsujin I created a new user and I set to change the desktop wallpaper every 5 seconds. I have no problems there. <comment242739> So you need to discover what your user has running in the background that's eating the speed - not sure where to start, maybe activity monitor? <comment242744> @Tetsujin I think I found it: transparent, blurred background in terminal <comment242831> Ah, yes - I've heard of that slowing things down before. Add it as an answer, for future ref.
