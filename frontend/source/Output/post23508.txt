Is there an equivalent to ⌘ + D in the new save dialogs? <body> In Snow Leopard and prior, when clsoing a window with unsaved changes, the system would suggest to either save, cancel or discard the changes from keyboard shortcuts. You could:  ul lisave kbdreturn/kbd/li licancel kbd⌘/kbd+kbd./kbd/li lidiscard the changes kbd⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd./li /ul  The Lion save dialog that gets summoned instead of the "Would you like to save?" dialog works differently:  kbd⌘/kbd+kbd./kbd and kbdreturn/kbd still worksup1/sup, but kbd⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd has no effect.  Is there a new keyboard shortcut to discard?  sub1. I'm not in front of my Mac right now; emIIRC they work/em, but maybe I'm wrong./sub  <answer23511> In Terminal.app, you can change this back to the old behaviour using  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSSavePanelStandardDesktopShortcutOnly -bool YES /code/pre  To revert to the default behaviour, set  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSSavePanelStandardDesktopShortcutOnly -bool NO /code/pre  <answer23512> kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌫/kbd  Pressing Command-Delete (or perhaps more commonly known as backspace) also does the same trick.   That's all there is to it!  <answer23604> It depends on the application. For example, in Powerpoint 2011 ⌘D still works, ⌘⌫ does nothing in the dialog.  I guess it's personal preference, I like to use Space (or Tab until Don't Save is in focus, Space) for this action.  <comment26245> It's not a bug, it's a feature! <comment26250> Thanks for this, I'm not quite used to the new way. When doing this, does Cmd-Delete do anything? <comment26260> Thanks, I'll be tryig that when I get home! <comment26276> cmd-delete also works when this is in place. best of both worlds. <comment26319> ⌘D actually DOES have an effect; it sets the save destination to the Desktop, as it always has in open/save file dialogs.
