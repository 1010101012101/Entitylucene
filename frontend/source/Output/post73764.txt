What is the "wake for wifi network access" setting in energy preferences? <body> Can anyone explain the "wake for wifi network access" setting in energy preferences for me?  I do not understand it.  <answer73766> Wake for wifi network access (aka Wake on Demand but with Wifi) allows your computer to be brought out of sleep mode when someone else on the network requests access to a service on your computer eg. File sharing.   From this Apple KB article     Wake on Demand helps you save energy and reduce costs while still   ensuring full access to all your shared files and devices, even   remotely across the Internet. Wake on Demand works by partnering with   a service running on your AirPort Base Station or Time Capsule called   Bonjour Sleep Proxy. When Wake on Demand is enabled, any Mac on your   network running OS X will automatically register itself and its shared   items with the Bonjour Sleep Proxy. When a request is made to access a   shared item on a Mac running OS X, the Bonjour Sleep Proxy asks that   Mac to wake and handle the request. Once that request is complete, the   Mac will go back to sleep at its regularly-scheduled interval as set   in the Computer Sleep section of the Energy Saver preferences pane.   <answer240143> Yes, it is can helps you save energy (if you need that services), But if you don't need - It is only will strongincrease/strong the electricity consumption.  <comment244232> Thx for answer. Does it mean that downloads can be running when the macbook is in the sleep mode? <comment314546> While good advice I suppose this doesn't answer the question <comment353181> @kelin no, it just allows it to wake up after some network requests (i.e. when accessing shared files on it from other computer).
