Change accessibility setting on Mac for command line program <body> I have built a simple command line program with Xcode, and I would like to access the NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents method. It seems like the program must be trusted for this to work.  precodeself.monitor = NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(matching: NSEventMask.mouseMoved, handler: { e in     print(e) }) /code/pre  How can I add a command line program to the list of trusted applications?  <answer296023>    you have to export your app via Product  Archive  Export...  Export   as a Mac Application, then move the app to wherever you want it (i.e.,   your Applications folder).
