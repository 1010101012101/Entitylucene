Can I trigger any action only by a control key in Keyboard Maestro? <body> I would like to trigger an action that puts strings code%&gt;%/code by a double-tap on a control key only on some specific apps. I have used Karabiner, and the action there is the following:  precode    &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Add "%&gt;%"&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;private.add_dplyr_operand&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;only&gt;R, RStudio, Terminal, iTerm2&lt;/only&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;             __DoublePressModifier__             KeyCode::CONTROL_L,             KeyCode::CONTROL_L,             KeyCode::SPACE | ModifierFlag::NONE,             KeyCode::5, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R | ModifierFlag::NONE,             KeyCode::DOT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::NONE,             KeyCode::5, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::NONE,             KeyCode::SPACE | ModifierFlag::NONE         &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  I tried to add the codecontrol/code trigger, however. But the window box (currently ⌘⌥4 is shown) seems to not accept only the peripheral key like control, alt, or command.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aII5J.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is it possible to trigger an action only by control key on Keyboard Maestro, and only on some specific apps (R, Terminal, iTerm2, and RStudio in my case)?  I'm on El Capitan but would like to know any solution that works in Sierra (or High Sierra) as well.
