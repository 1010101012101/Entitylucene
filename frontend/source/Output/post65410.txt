Why does my monitor changes colors when the graphics adapter changes? <body> Whenever my graphics adapter changes, whether intentionally or automatically, i notice the colors changing.They get definitely brighter, more blueish when on the high performance card.  Is this normal? Different graphics cards mean different color?  MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz (Late 2011) MBP Unibody 15"  ul liAMD Radeon HD 6770M/li liIntel HD Graphics 3000/li /ul  <answer65488> It's not normal, but a known issue. The problem appears each time your MacBook Pro switches to a emDiscrete Graphics Card/em.   There are a couple of things you could try, as a temporarily fix:  ul liTurn strongOff/strong the emAutomatic Graphics Switching/em in strongSystem Preferences / Energy Saver/strong, Reboot, and then turn it strongOn/strong again. This will make the emDiscrete Card/em to be initialized correctly. This emfix/em will work, though, until your next reboot./li liUse stronggfxCardStatus/strong to emforce/em the use of the strongIntegrated Card/strong only./li /ul  Some users got rid of it just by strongRebooting/strong, strongRepairing Permissions/strong, strongUpgrading to the newest version/strong or Reinstalling, though.  <comment77030> It seems its kind of random. Every once in a while I get a 'bad startup' and this happens. Thanks for clearing it up
