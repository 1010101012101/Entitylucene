How to make icons appear at top of MacVim again <body> I just upgraded to a new version of MacVim.  There used to be a row of icons at the top of every MacVim window with buttons for opening/saving files, cut/paste/delete, etc. Now that row of buttons is gone.  What is that row of buttons called and how do I get it to appear again?  <answer87151> in the editor--  precode:set guioptions+=T /code/pre  you can embed this command in $USER/.gvimrc to make sure it happens every time you start up.  <answer87261> If you just want to toggle the toolbar temporarily, you can also use the GUI:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WGXuS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment101999> I chose the setting ":set guioptions+=T" as the accepted answer but this answer is also quite helpful. Thanks.
