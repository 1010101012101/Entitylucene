Terminal uses one theme for the first window and a different theme for later windows. <body> I want to set the "Homebrew" theme to be the default in Terminal.  I've changed the setting in the preferences: I chose "on startup, open" : "new window with settings" : "Homebrew".  Here is a screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBfRq.png" alt="screenshot of Terminal&#39;s &quot;startup&quot; preference pane"  Terminal uses "Homebrew" only for the first window. Then I do cmd-W to close the window and cmd-N to get a new window. The new window appears with the "Basic" theme! But if I do cmd-Q and restart Terminal then it gives me a "Homebrew" window again. Why don't terminal themes work properly?  <answer60399> Go to Terminal → Preferences → Settings → Profiles, select the Homebrew theme, and click the ‘Default’ button. Then quit Terminal and restart to confirm it works.  <comment70020> “On startup” means “when starting Terminal”, not “when opening a new window”. <comment196505> thanks, that really helps! Anyway, the app's behavior seems to be wrong, I have an option "New window opens" set to "Same profile", not the "Default profile" and it opens the default, not the same. It's not clear why do they have same/default option, if both actually default? <comment268451> Hi, what if the default button is greyed out? Any guesses why it might be so? If it's a matter of my privileges (this is a work computer) I will scream. <comment324989> oddly enough this works. But not with the "solid colors" theme. The latter changes colors on each new launch o.O
