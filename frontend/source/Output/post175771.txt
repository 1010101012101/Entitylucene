Alternative to Personal Blocklist for Safari <body> I’d want to filter a bunch of spammy sites from the search results on Google, just like the Personal Blocklist extension does on Chrome, is there an alternative to Google’s Personal Blocklist extension for Safari?  I’ve found this but seems outdated.  <answer230108> Kind of late, but I hope it will help some people. I use this script with Tampermonkey, it works great on 10.11.3 / Safari 9.0.3.  <comment324545> Very powerful! Thank you!
