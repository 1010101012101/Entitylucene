How can I launch a Virtualbox VM from the Dock? <body> How can I put my VirtualBox on my Dock in Mac OS X Lion.  I want to have it on my dock so I can click on it to launch it.  <answer73899> I don't use Virtualbox, but based on a couple resources, it looks like you can launch a specific VM from the command line, which means we can create a basic Automator application to serve as a launcher, which you can then put in the Dock.  In strongAutomator/strong, create a new workflow. Add a strongRun Shell Script/strong action, and enter code/abolute/path/to/vboxmanage startvm "vmname"/code in the text box. Replace codevmname/code with the name of your VM as it appears in the Virtualbox GUI (make sure to keep the quotes though). Save the workflow, setting the strongFile Format/strong to strongApplication/strong. Then drag the resulting app onto your Dock.  <comment85853> i did not work :( <comment85857> Try running the `vboxmanage` command in Terminal and see what output it generates. <comment85858> When I create the workflow, this is what my command looks like.  /usr/bin/vboxmanage startvm /Users/mark/VirtualBox\ VMs/Windows7\ Pro\ 64/Windows7\ Pro\ 64.vbox  -- I saved it as "Windows7" <comment85859> Once I did that, I saved it to my /Applications folder and then copied the VirtualBox icon (`cmd-c, cmd-v` over the icon in the `cmd-i` (get info) for the Automator script) and dragged it to the Dock. <comment85864> The parameter to the `startvm` command should be the *name* of the VM, not the path to its file. <comment85869> @robmathers it seems to work better, at least for me using the full path to the vm. <comment85872> Hmm okay, must be undocumented. In any event, is it working for you as an Automator application @MarkCohen? <comment85876> Yup! It sure is. <comment86111> i dont have have vboxmange?  I have /usr/bin/vboxwebsrv <comment86112> Try replacing that path with `/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxManage`, per [this forum post](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=18054). <comment86117> this worked but how can I change the icon. <comment86125> The easiest way to change the icon is to **Get Info** (File menu, or ⌘I) on the app you created, do the same on another file/app with the icon you want, select the icon and copy/paste it over. <comment86128> i did not work.. I want to it and did a  ⌘I and then draged the new image i wanted on it but all that it did was start my vm <comment86131> You can't drag and drop with app icons.
