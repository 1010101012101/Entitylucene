Is it enough to install Xcode? <body> I use OS X El Capitan. I installed Xcode 7 from AppStore and macports from an official website.  When I'm trying to install something using macports: codesudo port install nodejs4/code, I'm getting the following warning: codeWarning: The Xcode Command Line Tools don't appear to be installed; most ports will likely fail to build./code. But compiler (codecc/code) works, codemake/code works, and I actually installed few macports packages without any problems.  Now if I run codexcode-select --install/code, I'm getting dialog to install Developer Tools. But I think that Xcode already has all those tools:   precode$ xcode-select -p /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer /code/pre  So the question is: is it some bug in macports or is there some tools not included with Xcode 7 which must be installed separately using codexcode-select --install/code? I don't want to introduce unnecessary clutter.  <answer248648> You have to install the developer tools to run the C compiler and other build tools (e.g. linker, make) from the command line and provide support files e.g. include and libraries  The command line tools  are in places like /usr/bin and so installing via the AppStore cannot put the tools in the correct place. This a separate install step has to be done.   <answer248654> So I've inspected macports sources and it turns out that this warning is displayed, when directory code/usr/include/code or executable code/usr/bin/make/code is missing. While I have working code/usr/bin/make/code, directory code/usr/include/code was indeed missing. Installing command-line tools using codexcode-select --install/code fixed it.  <answer248673> As a comment on the original question said, you must go to Xcode's settings, then to the last tab, Locations. The options for which command line toolset to use is there.  <comment308149> If you open Xcode and go to Preferences, does it show command line tools installed? They aren't installed by default, just because you downloaded Xcode (in my experience). <comment308158> But those tools are working from terminal right now. There's `/usr/bin/clang` and it works, I can compile C programs. Same about `/usr/bin/make`, `/usr/bin/xcrun`, etc. <comment308160> @ruddfawcett I wasn't able to find anything about command line tools in Xcode 7. I remember that they were there in old versions, but now I can only see emulators and documentation for downloading. I think that Xcode now installs command-line tools automatically. <comment308162> @user3439894 I will use Xcode regardless, I just don't want to install additional packages if it's not necessary. Command line tools seem to work fine, unless I missing some. But macports complain and I don't understand, why. <comment308281> If that was indeed what solved your problem, consider accepting your own answer so that this question no longer shows up in the "unanswered" lists.
