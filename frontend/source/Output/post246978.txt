Can I copy xcode from my applications folder to external hard disk? <body> I downloaded xcode from the Mac App store on my home computer and it installed to around 11 GB on my applications folder. I tried copying the xcode app from the applications folder to my external hard drive where I was stopped mid-way and the error said some items can't be moved to due permission issues (that's not exactly what the error said but something like that). Is there any solution?  <answer247073> Have you reviewed the helpful details in this question?   I have successfully moved Xcode to a different drive (though in my case an internal SSD), but as the answer says a simple move doesn't quite sort everything out, and you need to fix where various Command Line Tools think the install is. The problem with permissions is probably not due to it being an external drive. You need to get enough permissions to move files, which you can do at the command line ('terminal' application). If you don't know how, then look for help on moving and relinking directories in OS X and proceed carefully having practiced on tiny directories first, having taken a backup.  PS I can't comment on the question, wpbut I think your mean strongmove/strong not strongcopy/strong which makes a big difference.  <comment304718> The exact error message actually would help us to help you :-) <comment304720> "The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access some of the items." @patrix
