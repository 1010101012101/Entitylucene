Safari Share Submenu <body> I would like to be able to have both mac mail and outlook show up in the "share" folder of Safari.   It appears that I can have one or the other, depending upon my 'default' mail app, but sometimes I want to share using the other app.  <comment183897> Get Microsoft to add an App Extension so Outlook will show up in the share menu. As unlikely as it sounds that you would be able to get Microsoft to do that, that is the only way to accomplish what you want AFAIK.
