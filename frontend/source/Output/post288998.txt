macOS - Finder separator in Sierra <body> how can I separate these folders in macOS Sierra? About a week ago 'iCloud' and 'Desktop' folders were not in my favorites, but I was able to move them down. Yesterday I ran out of iCloud in my macbook and disappeared from that location. Do I get separated?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wQu6u.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer289081> ul liFrom the Finder, select Finder-Preferences (or press CMD-,) to access Finder preferences./li liClick 'Sidebar' tab/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jrjh1.png" alt="enter image description here"  There you can select which items appear in Favorites, Devices and other sections in the Finder sidebar. As far as I know you can't create additional separators within these sections, but you can drag/drop items in the sidebar to reorder them.
