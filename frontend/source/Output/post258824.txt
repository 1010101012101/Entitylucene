Not logged into game center, how do I get back into the game on a different device? <body> I play clash royale, and got pretty far up. However, I refused to sign into game center because I though it was stupid. I recently lost my iPod touch that I played on, and now have a new phone. Is there any way that I can get back my progress on the same account? I would really appreciate if you could help, even if it's a no. To review, I have not signed into game center at all, and I'm trying to get back my progress from my other account. I still know my Clash Royale username. Thanks again!  <comment323637> From my understanding, it's only possible to do this with Game Center. However, if you have signed into the Game Center app and you still aren't able to recover the game, try deleting the game and reinstalling it, then selecting recovery of your game. <comment323645> Ok, thank you. I haven't signed into the Game center app, and I don't have my iPod at all. Do I need both devices to recover the game the second way? <comment323646> Nope! Just the new one <comment323650> And what would that recovery recover? Would it recover the game I had on my old device? <comment323651> It should, yes!
