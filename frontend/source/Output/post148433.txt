How to stop my machine asking for multiple passwords when I log in? <body> Ever since I changed my user account password, every time I log in to my machine I have to enter multiple passwords. First, I enter the new account password to actually log in. Once I'm at my desktop I get prompted to enter a few other passwords too. Namely the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBxEZ.png" alt="Messages Agent" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPeSd.png" alt="Chrome" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NKMTo.png" alt="enter image description here"  My old password is required to successfully dismiss all of the above pop-ups. Is there some way of updating anything in my keychain that still uses the old password, to use the new password?  Any ideas what could have caused this? I can only imagine that the intended behaviour is for this update to happen automatically.  <answer148437> If you change your account's password using your Mac OS X Install disc (or if your network-based account password is changed due to a network admin forcing a password change), your default keychain password (which uses the same initial password as your user account) does not change.  Support Apple helps:  If you want your default keychain to be unlocked automatically when you log in, synchronize your Keychain Access and account login passwords by doing this:  ol liOpen codeKeychain Access/code (you can get to it by choosing Utilities from the Go menu in the Finder)./li liFrom the codeEdit menu/code, choose codeChange Password for Keychain "login."/code/li liType the former password of the account that you are currently logged in to, then click OK./li liIf you entered the correct password, a new window appears; enter the original password again in the codeCurrent Password/code field./li liIn the codeNew Password/code field, type the password that matches your current account password./li liRe-enter the newer password in the codeVerify/code field, then click OK./li /ol  strongIf you don't remember your original (former) account password/strong  If you don't remember your original password, you'll need to delete the keychain. Deleting a keychain also deletes all the password data saved in that keychain.  ol liIn codeKeychain Access.app/code, choose codePreferences/code from the Keychain Access menu./li liIf available, click the codeReset My Default Keychain/code button. This will remove the login keychain and create a new one with the password provided./li liIf codeReset My Default Keychain/code is not available, choose codeKeychain List/code from the Edit menu./li liDelete the "login" keychain./li /ol  The next time you log in to the account, you can save your current password in a keychain.  strongIf the above fails or doesn't fit:/strong  ol liOpen codeKeychain Access.app/code/li liSelect the code"login" keychain/code from the keychains list/li liClick the lock at the top to lock the code"login" keychain/code/li liClick the lock again to unlock the login/li liAfter entering your code"login" keychain/code password you should be presented with a dialog/li liClicking the reset button will re-sync your code"login" keychain/code password with the iCloud keychain password./li /ol  Info: Discussions Apple  strongIf everything from the above fails for whatever reason the last resort you can do is the following:/strong  ol liQuit all running Applications/li liIn Finder codeSelect Go &gt; Go to folder/code (⇧⌘G)/li liIn the window that appears, type the following: code~/Library/Keychains//code/li liClick OK./li liLook for a folder with a random name similar to this "A8F5E7B8-CEC1-4479-A7DF-F23CB076C8B8".
