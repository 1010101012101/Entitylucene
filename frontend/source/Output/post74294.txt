Lack of sharing options <body> Im having some trouble using the new sharing features in Finder, Preview, etc. Having tried with many different file types (pictures, text, audio, video), it only ever lists Messages and Airdrop. Not Email or Twitter. I have connected my Twitter, Facebook and Gmail accounts under the Mail, contacts &amp; calendars section in system preferences, and set up Chrome (Gmail) as the default mail application in the Mail preferences. Have I missed something Im supposed to do to get it working? Im located in Norway atm, if that makes any difference.  <comment86286> Is the tweet service available if you select text in TextEdit? The email service might only work with Mail. <comment86289> Yes, weirdly it is. It lists email, twitter, message and facebook. <comment86457> The sharing context depends on the selected item. Not every kind of item can be shared with every service. Also it is kind of dumb since it will for example list flickr and Facebook for sharing a picture where I don't have accounts on these platforms (and hence they aren't set up on my Mac).
