Accidentally Removed EFI Partition <body> I removed the EFI partition accidentally but I have it on a Time machine backup. Is there a way to simply move it from my external drive to my boot drive.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PrjZr.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried restoring the format of the boot drive EFI but it gives me an error.   bash-3.2# diskutil eraseVolume fat32 EFI disk0s1 Started erase on disk0s1 Unmounting disk Error: -5344: MediaKit reports not enough space on device for requested operation  Any help will be awesomely appreciated.   <comment175543> So we learn how did you mange to erase it,could you tell us. <comment175544> possible duplicate of [How to fix broken EFI partition?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57597/how-to-fix-broken-efi-partition) <comment175548> I'm actually not sure I was getting rid of a recovery partition and I think I muddles the disk identifier. So I used the zeroDisk command and then the eraseVolume one. That have me a partition that was hfs+ and I tried changing it back to fat32 as above but that didn't work. I copied the Bootlog from the old EFI partition to my desktop. Is there a way to format it properly and I can probably just copy that file over. Im still logged into the mac so if I shut down it's not going to work <comment175550> Thanks for that Buscar but that won't do it for me as I'm stuck on this machine at the minute and I can't unmount the drive.   Does anyone know of anyway other that 'gpt' to change the format of the hfs+ to efi, alternatively - is there a way to swap these out as I have that partition on the external ? Essentially I just need to swap out disk0s1 with disk1s1 <comment175551> here http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1237  and here http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4125
