App Store Mavericks <body> Well Maverick is FREE apparently but I can't upload it because the app store won't update so my system 10.6.8 says ...so how free is it exactly? Is this the beginning of the end for apple? Like Adobe selling software as a rented service now?  <answer129214> Is the hardware supported by Mavericks? Also, are the latest updates installed on the machine?  According to http://www.tomsguide.com/us/upgrade-snow-leopard-mavericks,news-18388.html it should be possible.  <answer129219> Mac OS X 10.9, Mavericks, IS a free upgrade that is available from Apple via the App store for Macs running 10.6.8 or higher.  This is reinforced by this screen shot, showing it's price as free in two different areas as well as the 10.6.8 requirement:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vtHML.png" alt="enter image description here"  I suspect what you're running into is a compatibility issue.  The Mac App Store listing for Mavericks lists 10.6.8 as the only requirement, however Apple goes into detail about hardware specific requirements in this knowledge base article - OS X Mavericks: System Requirements  Currently the requirements (copied from this article) are as follows:  ul liiMac (Mid-2007 or later)/li liMacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008), (13-inch, Early 2009 or later)/li liMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or later),/li liMacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later)/li liMacBook Air (Late 2008 or later)/li liMac mini (Early 2009 or later)/li liMac Pro (Early 2008 or later)/li liXserve (Early 2009)/li /ul  In addition to requiring these specific generations of Macs you will also need to ensure they meet these additional requirements:  ul liOS X Mountain Lion, Lion, or Snow Leopard v10.6.8 already installed/li li2 GB or more of memory/li li8 GB or more of available space/li /ul  If your Mac meets all of these requirements and it still refuses to download/upgrade properly then you likely have another issue occurring.  At that point I would recommend either clarifying your question here or contacting Apple support for additional assistance.  Rest assured though, Mavericks is a completely free upgrade for the Macs I've listed above.  There is no subscription model, no hidden fees, etc.  Hope that helps!  <comment151235> Not sure if I understand... But If You want to download Mavericks here are official Apple guides: https://www.apple.com/hk/en/osx/how-to-upgrade/ Maybe You do not have compatible hardware or something. <comment151236> So what's your question? <comment151237> You can't "upload" it ? <comment151247> Are you having problems understanding how the app store works in general or are you looking to troubleshoot the installation process or just express dissatisfaction that something free of payment might cause you effort and thought to use it?
