Mac Audio Problems <body> I have this problem. I have some Sony Headphones i use on iMac, they really do work good, it's been around 4 months i have been using them now. Now, i start up my Mac to go to safari and listen to some songs. I realize that my headphones are a bit loud. I hit F11 on my apple keyboard to lower down the audio and for some reason it won't lower! I can hit the mute button and still nothing will happen. Can someone help me with this issue, please?  <answer121341> Try holding down the fn button, located at the bottom far left corner of the keyboard. Your keys might have somehow got switched up because I have found that if the buttons at the top do not work, holding fn and pressing the button makes it work  Hope this helps  <comment141443> Kind of worked, but did not solve my problem.
