How can I unmount a drive every time I reboot? <body> As relates to an answer to a previous question, I'd like to unmount a built-in hard drive every time I boot up. (Or alternately arrange for it not to be mounted). How do I do this?  <answer4886> Use a LaunchAgent (see Lingon) that runs at boot to unmount. If it runs too quickly, add a wait/pause/sleep. The action that unmounts can be in whatever you preferred scripting/automation language is (bash (hdiutil), Automator, AppleScript, etc.)  <answer5028> The following Hint on Mac OS X Hints details a way to do this. Basically you'll create (or modify) the file code/etc/fstab/code and add a line similar to:  precodeUUID=F0E430C1-5558-3BB3-9FA9-6904B663FEEA  none  hfs  rw,noauto /code/pre  The actual UUID will vary, you can find the UUID for your disk in codesystem.log/code:     In Mac OS X Panther, Disk Utility and   the diskutil command doesn't display   the UUID value. But if you look in the   system.log file, when the disk is   mounted, you can see something similar   to this (line breaks added for   narrower display):  precode ... localhost diskarbitrationd[87]: disk1s9   hfs      77F3E84D-E0ED-3194-96A5-BED10893FFF4  /code/pre      FireWire HDbr          /Volumes/FireWire HDbr         ... localhost diskarbitrationd[87]: disk1s10  hfsbr          F0E430C1-5558-3BB3-9FA9-6904B663FEEA    Mac OS X Disc           /Volumes/Mac OS X Disc      The string before the volume name is   the UUID for the disk.   <comment3953> I edited my answer to your other question to include a way that you can prevent the drive from being mounted.
