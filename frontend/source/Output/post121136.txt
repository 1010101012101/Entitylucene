Using `say` to read terminal output from a command line tool? <body> I'm not sure if this is possible. I'm using a command line log parser for an MMO I play. Information is shown in Terminal window but I have to read it while playing rather than hear it while playing. I'd like to program Terminal to strongsay/strong the output as it's being streamed to the screen.  I'm new to the command line and Terminal-- is there a way to do this?  <answer121137> precode&lt;command&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 | while read line ; do echo $line | say ; done /code/pre  supReplace code&lt;command&gt;/code with the normal command that outputs what you would like to be spoken./sup  <comment141189> You may want to pipe it to a `say` + `sleep` function so there's a slight pause between reading each line.
