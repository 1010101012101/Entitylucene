Creating an animation from a bunch of .pdf files <body> I have histograms in a bunch of hundreds of .pdf files.  I would like to find a way to make an animation from these files to use in a Powerpoint presentation.  How can I do that ? It would also be great to be able to view the animation with Quicktime.  <answer14240> You could try the following:  ol liJoin your PDF files: How to merge pdf files in Mac OS X â€“ CombinePDFs/li liConvert your PDF to Keynote format: PDF to Keynote  /li liCreate your movie: Exporting Keynote Presentation to QuickTime Compatible Movie File/li /ol  Later you can use your created .MOV in another Keynote presentation.
