Disable power nap when not plugged in <body> Power nap is a good idea when my laptop is plugged in at night.  However I notice that it also happens when it is not plugged in.  When I wake up in the morning I will immediately notice some emails in Mail.app which are from 2am. Then after a few more moments it will connect to Wifi then I will get all my emails.  I am not sleep walking. The computer is not plugged in. Is this behavior documented? Can I turn it off?  Also, my Enable Power Nap while on battery power is off. This seems to be something else.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oERTN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment199405> do you check energy saver setting in system preferences? you can disable Power Nap while on battery power. <comment199456> Sorry, forgot to mention the obvious.
