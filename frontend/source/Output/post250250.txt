How to let htop display all columns correctly when using the Homebrew Terminal profile? <body> I've installed codehtop/code with :  precodebrew install htop /code/pre  But when I run it with codesudo htop/code, the user column is not fully displayed. Some parts are missing.  How to display it correctly?  P.S.: I'm using the Homebrew Terminal profile.  <answer250251> Go to the menu codeTerminal -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; Profiles -&gt; Text/code  and select codeUse bright color for bold text/code  Now you can see everything.  <comment310895> Hmm, I tried to replicate this behaviour, but could not see that "the user column is not fully displayed". Are you saying that you're just getting black text on a black background (which the "Homebrew" profile would have)? <comment310921> Yes, exactly black on black and when I move the selection bar on a line, I can read again the text. I'm using Terminal 2.6.1 (361.1)
