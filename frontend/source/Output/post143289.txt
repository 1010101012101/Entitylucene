Xattr code no longer removing tags <body> I've been using this workflow for a while now that allowed me to right-click on any file or folder and send a copy to OneDrive and replace existing files, but it was set up to strip the files of their meta data like tags so that I don't get duplicated in Finder Tags.  I have a new system with 10.9.4 and this code is no longer working. Now it makes a copy and puts it in my OneDrive folder, but it doesn't take away the metadata so I have multiples of the same file in each Finder Tag. Can someone who knows coding spot the problem?  Here is the code straight from Automator:  precodefor FILE in "$@";do   FILE_NAME="${FILE##*/}"   if [ -d "$FILE" ]; then      rsync -rut "$FILE"/ /tmp/"$FILE_NAME"     xattr -rc /tmp/"$FILE_NAME"     rsync -rut /tmp/"$FILE_NAME"/ ~/OneDrive/"$FILE_NAME"     rm -r /tmp/"$FILE_NAME"/   else     rsync -ut "$FILE" /tmp/"$FILE_NAME"     xattr -c /tmp/"$FILE_NAME"     rsync -ut /tmp/"$FILE_NAME" ~/OneDrive/"$FILE_NAME"     rm /tmp/"$FILE_NAME"   fi done /code/pre  <comment168746> If you manually run `xattr -c` on the file in `/tmp`, do the tags get removed?
