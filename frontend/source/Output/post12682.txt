No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key <body> um...i don't know what happened..  I just opened lid to wake up my mac then it freezed. I re-booted it and now i'm seeing "No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key"  i'm using intel 320 ssd 120gb.   Should I re-install mac os again? How can I make sure that it won't happen again?  <answer12684> It's possible the drive is failing. Before doing anything else, backup your data. Holding the option key brings up the startup manager which shows any available volumes.  Do you have multiple drives connected to your computer? Maybe it is trying to boot using the wrong drive.  <comment13296> this is so stupid...i just re-booted and pressed option key..now i can boot. Why is this happening?? <comment15775> Agree, sounds to me like the drive is failing. Sadly, SSD drives don't seem to have a great lifespan, as yet:  http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html
