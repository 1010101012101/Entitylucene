How can I update to macOS 10.12.1 (16B2657)? <body> I'm trying to develop apps that use the new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar.  On Apple Developer's documentation, it states that at least Build 16B2657 is required.     To develop apps that use the Touch Bar, your Mac will need to run Xcode 8.1 on macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2657) or later.   hr  However, I have Build 16B2555 installed. As seen on Wikipedia, it seems like both Builds 16B2555 and 16B2657 are of version 10.12.1. However, one's released before the other.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FYQwO.png" alt="Image 1"   I've tried to check for updates in the App Store but there doesn't show any.  hr  I also tried downloading it from Apple Support. But it doesn't seem to install:     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HMWjw.png" alt="Image 2"   hr  h2So, how can I update to Build 16B2657?/h2  <comment327208> I'd suggest downloading the Sierra installer from the Mac App Store and installing it that way. If all else fails you can wait for 10.12.2 ;) <comment332059> And 10.12.2 is here now. Could you install this update?
