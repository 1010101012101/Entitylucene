Is RAID1 volume usable while rebuilding RAID after disk failure? <body> One disk of my 2-disk-RAID1-stack has failed and I'm about to replace it.  Is the volume usable—i.e. can I read &amp; write just as I normally could—while Disk Utility is rebuilding the RAID?  <answer214262> Yes, rebuilding happens in the background and the volume can be accessed normally.   I/O performance might be affected, but in my own experience it's more likely the rebuilding process that takes the performance-hit—i.e. rebuilding would be faster if the volume wasn't in use.  <comment258673> Also [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/88355/1453) is still relevant as of El Capitan.
