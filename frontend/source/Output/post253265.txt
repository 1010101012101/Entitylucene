Mac OS X 10.6.3 installation media <body> I bought the following DVD from Apple: Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.  The box that was delivered is as pictured in the link above (inserted here for convenience).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FznaN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The sealed package contains one DVD pictured below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tFAv0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The directory listing is as follows:  precode$ ls -l total 830 -r--r--r-- 1 unknown 197121     27 Mar 31  2010 autorun.inf drwxr-xr-x 1 unknown 197121      0 Mar 31  2010 'Boot Camp'/ -r--r--r-- 1 unknown 197121 296497 Feb 26  2010 'Boot Camp Installation &amp; Setup Guide.pdf' drwxr-xr-x 1 unknown 197121      0 Mar 31  2010 DVDCDSharing/ -r--r--r-- 1 unknown 197121   1786 Feb 26  2010 'Read Me.rtf' -r-xr-xr-x 1 unknown 197121 548664 Mar 31  2010 setup.exe* /code/pre  This is not what I expected. I expected installation media - but what I got is something called Boot Camp. Should I return this to Apple? Anyone know how I use this Boot Camp to install Snow Leopard?  <answer253266> It shows up as BootCamp because it assumes you are in a Windows environment on a Mac (for installing the drivers for your hardware after a BootCamp install); the OSX DVD's OSX Install portion/partition isn't meant to be read on Windows.  If you want to check the installer stuff, please run it on a Mac with OSX.  <comment315173> Did you insert the DVD into a Mac running OSX or into another system? <comment315174> I inserted into a windows machine <comment315175> Ah got ya - I assumed Universal Disk Format (UDF) used on DVDs was standard and readable from all OSes. <comment315176> What your received is indeed a Mac OS X Snow Leopard Install DVD, which is for Apple-branded hardware that supports that version of Mac OS X, **not** general PC hardware running Windows!
