G+ iOS app: mentioning doesn't work <body> I'm using the G+ app on my iPad 2 (6.1). Whenever I try to mention people in comments and type "+", the name doesn't come up (as it does in the android app) so I can select it. Even when I type the full name and send the comment, it stays black like the rest of the text and doesn't convert to a link (blue).  Anybody else has this issue? Any solutions?  <answer97353> Well, it seems it was a bug that is solved in the new version.  <comment114179> Thansk for reporting back on this.
