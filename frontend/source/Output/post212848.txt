Target Display mode: iMac mid 2011 with MacBook Pro 2013 late not working <body> Hardware &amp; OS LIST list:  ul liMac mid 2011i5 4 GB /li liMacBook Pro Retina late 2013 /li liThunderbolt Cable 2m/li liOS X El Capitanâ€Ž (both)/li /ul  I'm trying to connect my MacBook Pro with my iMac as extended display. When I connect both machines Thunderbolt port shows as inactive when I hit (cmd+f2 or cmd+fnc+f2) and nothing happens.I was thinking maybe my iMac port is not working. To test I borrowed a MacBook Air 2012 and connected it to my iMac and it worked.  Any help will be greatly appreciated!
