Run iTunes visualizer off of Spotify output or from built in Microphone? <body> I have always been a fan of Spotify rather than iTunes except for one feature. Spotify has no visualizer. The superb visualization feature of iTunes has always been an added plus to mirror to a TV during parties, but I'm tired of hijacking Spotify's audio into mp3 files so I can play them with iTunes to get a visualizer. brbrbMy question is:/bbr How, if at all can I use the audio output from Spotify (Or boom 2 which I also have installed) on my MacBook Pro to run the iTunes visualiser? If this isn't possible, can I run the visualizer off of my computer's built-in speakers (that would presumably be picking up the same music I'd be playing?)  brbrbNote:/bbr I have already tried multiple online and app store free visualizers, but all of them either didn't work or didn't provide a visualization experience even close to what iTunes offers.  <comment355422> I've been unable to figure out how to do this, and gave up tring. The iTunes visualizer effect works only with audio waveforms generated by iTunes itself
