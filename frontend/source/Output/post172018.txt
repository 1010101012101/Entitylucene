How can I change the keyboard shortcuts in Terminal.app for the application commands normally invoked using the unmodified ⇡ and ⇣ keys? <body> That is, how can I change the keyboard shortcuts for the application commands (I say emapplication commands/em in an attempt to avoid confusion with the use of the term "command" in the emshell command/em sense, given that the application under discussion here is Terminal…), that, by default, are accessed using the cursor up and down arrow keys?  I would like to be able to move back and forth through my shell command history using some other pair of keyboard shortcuts than the arrow keys.   I just know somebody will (misguidedly) ask, so I'll state in advance that: the reason is that the unmodified cursor keys have been re-purposed (their new employ is no one's business but mine, and it strongcertainly/strong has no bearing on the answer to my question), and the shortcuts I'd like to use instead are kbd⌥/kbd-kbd↑/kbd and kbd⌥/kbd-kbd↓/kbd.  <comment202457> This is something determined by the shell, not by Terminal. Which shell are you using? <comment202486> Would `set -o emacs` and using Cmd-P/Cmd-N be an option? <comment202494> I'm sorry for not specifying: this is for bash. <comment202590> Patrix: Excellent! This solved it. Thank you so much!
