Mini Mouse Stop it from pairing with another computer? <body> I work in a office with a bunch of macs and we all have mini mouse except for one person, who has a tablet pad. I had to use my mini mouse on that guys computer one day, and now everytime I turn my computer off my mouse connects to his computer.  How can I stop it from connecting to his computer at all?  <answer116170> On his computer, go to System Preferences â†’ Bluetooth and delete the mouse from the list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQwj0.png" width="400"  <comment135916> Removing the mouse from his computer is the only fix I can think of.
