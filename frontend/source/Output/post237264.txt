Profile Manager not signing some configuration profiles <body> I have an OS X Server, Yosemite 10.10.5, running Server v. 5.0.15, and I'm seeing configuration profiles that are pushed automatically to enrolled devices not get signed.  In Server.app, I have set Profile Manager to sign profiles using a Code Signing certificate.   From a client, I install the Trust Certificate and enroll the device (Macbook, El Capitan, 10.11.4).  I added a configuration profile, a simple VPN setup. The profile is set to push automatically. It appears on the client in System Preferences  Profiles, but unsigned. The trust profile and remote management profiles show strongverified/strong. However, the new VPN profile shows as unsigned.  The strange part is this: strongIf I download the profile manually in a browser, it appears in System Preferences  Profiles as signed/trusted/verified./strong  Why would the profiles be signed when manually downloaded and not when automatically pushed by the server?
