Question about using new unified logging feature in Sierra <body> I am trying to get logs of screensharing so that I can find one particular IP address connecting to my computer. I have tried "log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "screensharing"'" and I get some messages, but they all have  where I would expect to see real information.  Any help appreciated in tracking down this information.
