Quickly send pre-written response on Mac mail? <body> I get a lot of emails from recruiters sending irrelevant jobs to me, so I have a standard response that I copy and paste into replies. At the moment I do this manually from a saved text file. Is there a quicker way of doing this?   I was imagining there would be some way to save a reply so 1 button or shortcut would send this reply.   <answer284128> h2Quickly insert a standard response on macOS/h2  strongPrepare your response/strong  ol liOpen TextEdit./li liCreate new empty document (CMD+N)./li liType your desired response./li liSelect the text (CMD+A) and copy it to your clipboard (CMD+C)./li liConfirm by pressing codereturn/code./li /ol  hr  strongTeach macOS your response/strong  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liGo to Keyboard  Text/li liPress the code+/code button and enter a unique shorthand (e. g. coderresponse1/code).

I can only replace text with 1 line, not an entire email. <comment358433> @Evans Please copy and paste your response. It won't work if you enter it directly in to the 'With' field. <comment358434> Yes that works, thanks.
