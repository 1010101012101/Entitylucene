Can settings on Exchange server cause iOS to change Default Account for Notes? <body> Originally, my Default Account for Notes on my iPhone was set to "On My iPhone". At some point, though, the Default Account apparently switched to my Exchange account. As my notes are personal and my Exchange account is of course for work, that was an unwelcome surprise.  Genius Bar guy says that just adding the Exchange account to the iPhone can, depending on settings on the Exchange server itself, cause the Notes Default Account to be changed. Is that right? If not, is there another mechanism by which that might have changed without my explicitly having gone into Settings  Notes  Default Account and doing so myself?  Thanks!  <comment228715> Yes, my default is now set to my exchange account, I don't use notes and wouldn't have done that myself, so it happened just like the genius said.
