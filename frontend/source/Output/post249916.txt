What does the emergency dialer let you do? <body> I’m curious, but haven't tested: What does the emergency dialer let you do? If you don’t unlock the phone and press the codeEmergency/code button, it shows a phone keypad. Can you only dial emergency numbers? What happens if you try calling a normal number?  <answer249935> You can only dial emergency numbers, which vary by country/region (strong911/strong in the US; certain countries such as France have multiple emergency numbers). Dialing regular numbers produces the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wxjp1.jpg" width="280"   Starting with iOS 8, you may also dial emergency contacts by opening your strongMedical ID/strong. Interestingly, as of iOS 9.3.4, if you have one of those numbers memorized, you cannot punch it in directly. You must go through the strongMedical ID/strong to ring it up.  <comment310152> You can only dial emergency numbers. They vary by region 911, 112 etc. <comment310172> Note that 112 is the International Emergency number & you should be able to ring it from anywhere.
