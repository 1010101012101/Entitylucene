Replace vertical line with ">" in text copied from Mail and pasted to plain-text <body> When I copy the text of an email from Mail into a plain-text document, it loses the vertical lines marking replied text. Is there any way to replace those vertical lines with "" (greater-than signs)?  <answer228659> An OS X Service that reformats a forwarded Mail message with Markdown-style '' quotes â€” https://github.com/smokris/MailToMarkdown
