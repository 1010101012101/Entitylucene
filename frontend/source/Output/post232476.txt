Path in .bash_profile is not recognized <body> I have the following in .bash_profile:  precodeexport PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin/:${PATH}" /code/pre  I even tried it without the string:  precodeexport PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin/:$PATH /code/pre  I know for sure an executable lives in that bin directory:  precode$ cd /Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin $ ./psql psql: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user /code/pre  However, when I add the path to .bash_profile and then source .bash_profile (and even restart terminal), I get the following:  precode$ psql -bash: psql: command not found /code/pre  What am I doing wrong?  <answer232494> To add /Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin to the path simply add the line:  precodeexport PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  to the file ~/.bash_profile. If you have a second similar line starting with codeexport PATH.../code try to concatenate them.  After adding then line quit and open Terminal.app or enter codesource ~/.bash_profile/code to reload the modified .bash_profile.  Check the path with codeecho $PATH/code (which should yield: code/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin/code and the "existence" of psql with codewhich psql/code: code/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin/psql/code.  Afterwards enter codepsql -d database_name -U database_user_name/code with the following result:  precodePassword for user database_user_name:  psql (9.5.1) Type "help" for help.  postgres=#  /code/pre  Simply entering codepsql/code is as futile as entering codemkdir/code or codessh/code only.  <comment284071> How about this: `export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin/":$PATH` ? And then `source ~/.bash_profile`. <comment284072> @MateuszSzlosek the `export`s in the question seem to be ok. <comment284073> I installed postgresql from here http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#osx  All I am trying to do is get psql and other commands recognized from command line. <comment284075> I guess the problem was the order of the export. Adding to the end of the file was only time it worked. <comment284112> Your path statement is actually concatenating a path to the original path.  This means your path statement must be on a line _after_ the original path statement, thus why it worked as the last line of the file.
