Terminal command ncdu <body> I've seen the terminal command codencdu/code is available in various flavors of UNIX. Does anyone know if the same terminal command is available in OS X? Thanks for any help. It is greatly appreciated.  <answer173768> No, codencdu/code is not available in OSX. But, if you want it, you can install it via homebrew. You just need to type the following to install it:  precodebrew install ncdu /code/pre  This is the version availabe:  precode$ brew info ncdu ncdu: stable 1.10, HEAD http://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu Not installed From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/ncdu.rb /code/pre  <comment204452> untested, just from Google - http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/ncdu.shtml <comment293499> I'm honestly confused. Doesn't being available via homebrew mean that it's "available in OSX"? <comment293503> By default, It's not available on OSX. You need to install through homebrew.
