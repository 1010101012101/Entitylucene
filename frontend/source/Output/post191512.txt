Force Mac to backup photos to iCloud <body> I have recently enabled my Mac to backup photos from Photos.app to iCloud.  When I go to iCloud  Manage  Photos it says that there is 25MB of data in iCloud, however when I go to code~/Pictures/code and I right click on Photos Library and select Get Info it says that there is 1.1GB of data. I know this is true when I put them into another folder.  How do I force my Mac to upload my photos to iCloud?  This is not a duplicate of iCloud Photo Library - force upload since I have less then 250 photos so I am not exceeding the maximum limit.  <answer191537> Assuming you're on OS X 10.10 (with Photos.app): make sure you've enabled the appropriate checkboxes under "Options..." on the Photos row.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZINBI.png" alt="Screenshot of iCloud preference pane, with Photos option opened"  <answer191543> I know this seems a bit stupid. I think it was because I was a bit impatient. My upload speed is 0.71Mb/s (that means it will take 3 hours 43 minutes to upload!). It has only uploaded 170MB/1.1GB. I have however had my computer asleep for a few hours though.  Even though I have posted this I would still like to know how to force upload incase I need to in the future.  <comment227443> I had (except photo sharing). That wasn't the issue though. Have a look at my issue. <comment227486> The limits you reference in the other post are in regards to uploading to _shared_ iCloud photo albums, not your personal iCloud Photo Library. <comment227491> @tubedogg Thanks for clearing that up. Do you suggest to delete that comment I made then?
