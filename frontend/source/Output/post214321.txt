Saving photo in Messages to camera roll <body> I am trying to save a picture onto my camera roll, but when I message or email the picture to myself and try to save (click on the box with an arrow) the only options I get are to copy, print, or save to Dropbox. I want this picture for my wallpaper, but will need to get it off of camera roll to do that. How do I save the photo to my camera roll?  <answer214329> Simply press and hold the image thumbnail and tap "Save".  A copy will be saved to your camera roll.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oppBc.png" width="320"/  <comment258765> I've answered below, but it sounds like you're transferring it from one of your devices to anotherâ€”AirDrop is probably easier, if both devices are new enough to support it.
