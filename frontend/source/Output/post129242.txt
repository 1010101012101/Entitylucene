View Notability .note files on my Mac <body> I use Notability, a journal app, on my iPad and backup my documents to Dropbox using the app's proprietary code.note/code format. How can I read my code.note/code files on my Macbook? I am willing to convert the files to another format before reading them.  <answer129255> If the codenote/code format is just a plain text (codetxt/code) documents, you can probably open them with strongTextEdit/strong. But if itâ€™s in codeplist/code format, or other binary data, you can only open them when the developer build the desktop version accompanying your iPad version.  <answer166873> As of a few weeks ago there is a Mac OS X version of Notability.  You might also be interested what Gingerlabs says about it (FAQ).  <answer189003> Using Notability you can export or choose to Back up  your files in PDF format. You can open PDF files on your Mac using Preview.  <answer190135> Change the of the file to a .txt and you can open it. So for example 'name.note' becomes name.txt. The extension will change and text editor will be able to open it  <comment197183> See jeff hayes' answer. Gingerlabs released a version of Notability for Mac OSX since you wrote your answer.
