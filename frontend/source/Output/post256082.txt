iPhone takes a long time to turn on while charging <body> When my iPhone 5s dies, it usually turns on after 5-7 minutes of charging. Now, it sometimes takes 45 mins to over an hour to turn on while it's plugged in.  It also dies very easily. It can be at 100% battery, then within 10 minutes it's at 60%. Sometimes my phone even turns off at 100 or 50%.  Can somebody explain why this happens or what I should do? Is my battery broken?  <answer256103> You may need a battery replacement or bring it to Apple  <comment319234> Nobody will be able to tell you exactly what's going on. There needs to be diagnostic tools attached to your iPhone to determine what's happening. If your iPhone is under warranty, the best thing is to take it to Apple. If the battery is going bad, which is possibility, they can fix it. <comment319266> It depends on the circumstance, i.e. charging *may* be slower when connected to a dock. Also, charging via computer may have different outputs.
