how to 'custom install' with brew? <body> so I have to edit the install of wine, and apply a custom patch. The patch I want is here...   https://bugs.winehq.org/attachment.cgi?id=38156  and when I add these lines with codebrew edit wine/code  precodepatch do   url "https://bugs.winehq.org/attachment.cgi?id=38156"   sha256 "f1c4537f38e258c810ca33455e0947e3b2be1087bf9445fadac00424f294c004" end /code/pre  and then try to install, it does not actually add the patch. It seems to be downloading it from a prepackaged and compiled source because this is the terminal output...  precode==&gt; Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/wine-1.8.1.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz ######################################################################## 100.0% ==&gt; Pouring wine-1.8.1.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz ==&gt; Caveats You may want to get winetricks:   brew install winetricks   By default Wine uses a native Mac driver. To switch to the X11 driver, use regedit to set the "graphics" key under "HKCUSoftwareWineDrivers" to "x11" (or use winetricks).
