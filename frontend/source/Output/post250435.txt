Apple Music Membership <body> If I cancel my apple music membership will I lose all my music that i downloaded from the app? Is there any way I could keep the music ? I only need to switch my App Store country since I am moving to Boston from Indonesia..  <answer250438> You won’t lose the music you have downloaded, but strongyou also won’t be able to play the music/strong (unlesss you have purchased them separately on the iTunes Store).
