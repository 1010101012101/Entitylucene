Video not playing in Firefox on Mac <body> When I open this link Erlang which has a video, the video won't play. I am a beginner to Mac and recently reinstalled my macOS. I dont know why this video won't play on my Mac, but the same video plays in Firefox on another Linux based machine.   How do I solve this problem?  <answer290855> That is a flash video. You need to install flash for firefox.  https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/  <comment367141> In addition to the answer by בנימן הגלילי, I just wanted to add I couldn't get it to play in Safari, Firefox or Chrome in either macOS or Windows, so this behaviour isn't unique to OS or browser.
