Obtain AppleTV system logs <body> I have an Apple TV (4th generation). Since this is a true iOS device, I suppose it has system log like every Apple device. The device has some issues with waking up and I want to know the reason why it does. I hope this can be found in the logs.  My question is: is there any way to watch the log files? I know, that I can see the output in Xcode when I connect the Mac via USB and run Xcode, but this goes only for what's happening right now, and there is no way to scroll back to the time before I connected it. (I obviously need that.)
