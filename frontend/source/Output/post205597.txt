Convert image type and save to relative folder with automator <body> I found a question and working answer here How to create an Automator service to convert images from one file type into another file type using the right-click contextual menu? but it is saving the output file to desktop only. I can understand that this can be saved to relative path(like if source file is in directory /Desktop/Resources/myImage the output file in path /Desktop/Resources/myImage/Converted) with some actions in automator like set value for viable etc. But I am not familiar with that. How to use the strongset value for variable/strong and strongget value for variable/strong.   <answer205708> You don't need to play with variables. When I configure the service as below, it makes a copy of the files (?!) when I use the codeNew Folder/code action. Then it is a matter of converting the files in the new folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hli5J.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment247948> If no one does your work for you, feel free to edit in the code you have. It is far easier to point out a mistake than to teach someone to code from a problem statement of words.
