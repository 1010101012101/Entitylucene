Use a TV remote with my MacBook Pro <body> Does there exist any software that will let me use my TV remote (i.e., not the standard Apple remote) to control my MacBook Pro?  The MacBook Pro is an early 2011 model running the latest 10.9.2 version of OS X.  <comment146360> What do you want to control (e.g. music, volume, etc)? <comment146452> @AnonymousAppDev, ideally it'd be nice to have it be programmable / is there any way to listen for events from the infrared port? But yeah at the most basic level I'm looking to control music and volume.
