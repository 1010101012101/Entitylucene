AU Lab make popping sound on Mid 2009 MBP <body> Okay I'm switching all my stuff over from my Mid 07 Macbook and i like my music a little more with more bass and clear sounding than the computer provides normally. I enjoyed AU Lab with no issues on my Macbook but on the pro I'm experiencing a clicking sound. Anyone know the issue? I'm using sound flower bed to transfer the audio to the Equalizer. Running OS X Yosemite all updated.  <comment193409> Soundflower 1.6.6 or 1.6.7? It was forked to https://github.com/crmne/Soundflower/releases after Rogue Amoeba stopped supporting it. Fixed cracking in Mavericks, idk about Yosemite
