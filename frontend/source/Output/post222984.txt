Blocking an IP address <body> I need to block a particular website on my Mac (OSX 10.11.1, El Capitan).br I have already made the changes to /etc/hosts but the website is still not blocked when testing from Chrome.  I think this has to do with it being an HTTPS connection.  Procedure:   Using codesudo nano /etc/hosts/code, I have modified the /etc/hosts file to add the following lines: code 0.0.0.0    goodreads.com 0.0.0.0    176.32.103.85/code  I checked the changes with codecat /etc/hosts/code.  Then I flushed the DNS cache using codesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder/code and codesudo dscacheutil -flushcache/code. I then try to access the page from within Chrome and it succeeds.  I have also rebooted the machine, but the connection still succeeds.  It seems that this should work.   I have searched extensively, and this approach is the most recommended.  What am I missing?  <answer223001> Please use the following hosts file entries:  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1       localhost 127.0.0.1       goodreads.com www.goodreads.com www1.goodreads.com 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost fe80::1%lo0     localhost /code/pre  To properly block websites with the hosts file you also have to include aliases like www, ww1, www1, mail etc.   <comment270281> Confirmed.  When I added the www. to the domain name the website was blocked.  Many thanks!
