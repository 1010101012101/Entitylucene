Where is the F13 button on my MacBook Pro? <body> I was looking through the System Preferences for Mission Control in OS X Lion (10.7). One of the options had kbdF13/kbd in it but I couldn't find it anywhere.   Where is it?  <answer17988> Apple laptops don't have function keys higher than F12.   Certain Apple keyboards do, however.  When using an external IBM/PC keyboard, kbdPrtScn/SysRq/kbd, kbdScrLk/kbd and kbdPause Break/kbd should map to F13-F15.  <answer17989> MacBook's don't have the extended keyboard which contains the additional 7 function keys (F13-F19). They're only on Apple's full size ( with numeric keys) keyboard as presented on this photo:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2kJlU.png" alt="Apple keyboard photo"  <answer93320> You can use Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) to remap most keys on your keyboard. Particularly I used the option which maps the Eject button to F13 and Fn+Eject to Eject.  h1Important note:/h1  consider using a different key than Eject; since it sends KeyDown and KeyUp events at the same time the system will not notice you trying to hold it. Also, it does not send any event until a small delay time has passed, during which you must keep it pressed. This can be very annoying if you are a fast-typing maniac and wish to be able to hit it very quickly. However, delay time is smaller than 0.1 seconds on my keyboard, so you will hardly find it an issue  h3Another useful tip/h3  It is also useful if you liked old MacBook Pro keyboards which made a distinction between Return and Enter keys (very useful with Wolfram Mathematica for example) to remap the right option key to Enter. It has loads of other options, you will surely find it suitable for your needs.  <answer145737> Use these 3 keys to send an F13:  kbdshift/kbd kbdfn/kbd kbdF1/kbd  I used this to send an F13 key to my windows application using Remote Desktop.  <comment247162> This doesn't work for me. :(
