AppleScript choose file dialog box with default location not working <body> So there goes four hours of my life that I will never get back.  I'm trying to do something seemingly simple...  I want to open a file select dialog box and specify the default location.  I actually got this to work using the following...  precodechoose file with prompt "Please choose a file:" of type {"XLSX", "APPL"}  default location "/Users/lowken/Dropbox/" /code/pre  This works and does exactly what I want (the file dialog opens up in the Dropbox folder).  However when I try to use a string variable it doesn't work...  precodeset strPath to "/Users/lowken/Dropbox/"  choose file with prompt "Please choose a file:" of type {"XLSX", "APPL"}  default location strPath /code/pre  Now the dialog box opens in the root directory of the hard drive :-(  It seems that the default location is being ignored however if the path is not correct Applescript does raise a error.  I've tried casting the value as a string. I even tried to use the POSIX format...  precode"Macintosh HD:Users:lowken:Dropbox" /code/pre  This didn't format didn't work at all.  I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 on a mid 2012 MacBook Pro.  Can anyone help me?  <answer257210> Both scripts don't work for me. The problem is that the codedefault location/code parameter needs to be of type codealias/code. You can fix it by adding codePOSIX file/code in front of your path (the path does need to exist, otherwise you also get an error message):  precodeset strPath to POSIX file "/Users/lowken/Dropbox/"  choose file with prompt "Please choose a file:" of type {"XLSX", "APPL"} ¬     default location strPath /code/pre  Or you could use the "old style" HFS format:  precodeset strPath to alias "Macintosh HD:Users:lowken:Dropbox"  choose file with prompt "Please choose a file:" of type {"XLSX", "APPL"} ¬     default location strPath /code/pre  <comment234720> script worked fine for me.  Maybe a restart to clear things out, or copy and paste script to new editor window. <comment234726> It works but it doesn't open to the folder specified by srtPath. <comment234736> thats what I'm saying, it does open to the strPath for me.  /Users/username/Dropbox/ and shows my files inside of dropbox. <comment234805> Like tron_jones, I have had no trouble running either of your scripts. Have you tried setting the variable to a different path? Perhaps it's an issue with your Dropbox directory. <comment344265> At some point, Apple changed how things precompile in AppleScript. I remember running into this problem back in 2012. In my case, there was no workaround. I had to use the string literal. That was not the case with earlier versions of AppleScript.
