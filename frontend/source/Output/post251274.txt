Recording iPhone screen horizontally <body> I know how to record my iPhone screen with QuickTime, but when I record a certain app, my computer shows the display as vertical when it's proper direction is horizontal. How can I fix this i while recording /i because I'm live streaming the screen mirror to YouTube with obs. (Also, is there a way to flip it in obs instead of QuickTime?)  <comment312303> Try some 3rd party solutions?
