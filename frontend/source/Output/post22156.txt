What are the control keys available when working in a text field? <body> I know that kbdctrl/kbd-kbde/kbd will move to me to the end of a line, and kbdctrl/kbd-kbda/kbd to the start.  I also know that kbdctrl/kbd-kbdn/kbd will move down a line.  What other kbdctrl/kbd-key combinations are there?  Is it possible to move up a line?  How about, most desirable for me, is there something to move back and forth a word at a time?  I realize that I can do these things in emacs, or with an alternate set of keys in vi, but that's not what I am interested in.  If I am writing a question on one of the stackexchange sites or on a wiki, vi and emacs are not in play.  <answer22158> You can use kbdalt/kbd/kbdoption/kbd and the cursor kbd&larr; / &rarr;/kbd keys to move back and forth whole words at a time, taking you to either the beginning or end of the word depending on the direction you choose.  Using kbdshift/kbd also allows you to highlight text as you pass over it.  Using the same combinations with kbd&uarr; / &darr;/kbd does the same within paragraphs.  <answer22159> The default key bindings are stored in code/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict/code. You can use codeplutil/code to convert the file to an XML format, like so:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 -o StandardKeyBinding.xml  /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict /code/pre  Or, if you have Xcode or Property List Editor, you can open it there.  In addition, you can add your own bindings system-wide to code/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code, or per-user to code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code.  This page has a nice overview of bindings. I've grown particularly fond of strongTranspose/strong (kbd⌃/kbd-T), which swaps the two letters to the left and right of your cursor, fixing my most common kind of typo quickly.  In addition, there are various additional tricks using the kbd⌥/kbd and kbd⌘/kbd keys:  ul likbd⌘/kbd-kbd←/kbd and kbd→/kbd move to the beginning or end of the emline/em. Add kbd⇧/kbd to select everything in between./li likbd⌘/kbd-kbd↑/kbd and kbd↓/kbd move to the beginning or end of the emdocument/em. Add kbd⇧/kbd to select everything in between./li likbd⌥/kbd-kbd←/kbd and kbd→/kbd move to the beginning or end of the emword/em, or between multiple words. Add kbd⇧/kbd to select everything in between./li likbd⌥/kbd-kbd↑/kbd and kbd↓/kbd move to the beginning or end of the emparagraph/em. Add kbd⇧/kbd to select everything in between./li /ul
