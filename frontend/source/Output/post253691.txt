How to get all options for com.apple.finder.plist in ~/Library/Preferences? <body> how people know what's possible to be changed via CLI in OSX / macOS if codecom.apple.finder.plist/code is a binary file and calling codecat/code command for that file  shows only a binary gibberish output?  precodecat ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist /code/pre  I've found great option in macOS Sierra:     Keep folders on top when sorting by name   What's the name of it's codedefaults write/code so that I can add it into my settings script?  Basically instead of guessing I would like to know where to find all possible options. Does Apple provide it somewhere? I know this site but it's not up to date...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bo1Lpm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253751> To read/write em.plist/em files, use the codedefaults/code command.  The emkey/em that gets set when checking the strong[âˆš] Keep folders on top when sorting by name/strong check box under strongAdvanced/strong in strongFinder Preferences/strong is named: code_FXSortFoldersFirst/code   To set this in Terminal (or script) use the following emcommand/em:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder _FXSortFoldersFirst -bool YES /code/pre  To unset, use the following emcommand/em:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder _FXSortFoldersFirst -bool NO /code/pre  Note that in previous OS versions, strongFinder/strong needed to be restarted using codekillall Finder/code to have some settings, when changed by codedefaults/code, work properly. In strongmacOS 10.12/strong, this is not necessary for this particular setting, however the strongFinder/strong window does need to be refreshed by some means, e.g. toggling from list view to icon view and back.  hr  If you want to toggle between List view and Icon view in the embash script/em vs. using codekillall Finder/code after using codedefaults write .../code, use the following emcode/em block:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeosascript &lt;&lt;END tell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every Finder window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view         end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat end tell END /code/pre  Note: This method may not work with all setting changes made to Finder, although it works for code_FXSortFoldersFirst/code, nonetheless codekillall Finder/code may be required for some settings. It's just to early to tell with macOS 10.12.  <comment315724> idk what the cat command does, but com.apple.finder.plist is a plaintext xml file; ought to be relatively simple to find that command by toggling the pref. Not on Sierra to be able to test. <comment315817> @Tetsujin, The preference file for Finder, as stored on disk, is in fact a binary plist file not an xml file. It's just being displayed as such in the preview in Finder and or an app like TextWrangler. <comment315820> ah, OK. Then it would make more sense to view it from TextWrangler... which is what I usually do ;-)
