Hiding All Apple Music Features in iTunes (Apple Music Menus, Radio, Connect & Heart Column) <body> I want to uninstall Apple Music from iTunes. I don't really care of this so expensive new 'revolution' and it's taking too much place... :/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vF2Aw.png" alt="enter image description here"  For example how to delete  'For you, New, Radio and Connect'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qzo90.png" alt="enter image description here" And the heart  By the way, all my music is on local and I don't need cloud, radio or anything else.  Can anyone help me ?  <answer197141> Apple Music is baked into the current version of iTunes and you can't really "uninstall" it. That said there is an option to minimize its impact:  in iTunes  Preferences  general un-check "Show Apple Music"  I don't use Apple Music either and after reading this post (loopinsight.com, July 22, 2015), I'm glad I never did as Apple Music seems to be a bit buggy and can actually delete music you added yourself.  <answer197144> To remove the hearts, you can open iTunes  Preferences  General and set "Ratings" to be "Stars".  <answer197227> If you go into codePreferences &gt; General/code there's two things that you need to uncheck to disable emApple Music/em.  ol licodeShow Apple Music/code/li licodeiCloud Music Library/code/li /ol  For the emConnect/em Menu, you can do this by going into codePreferences &gt; Parental/code and checking the codeApple Music Connect/code tickbox.  Now I'm not entirely sure what ticking the codeInternet Radio/code box does in codePreferences &gt; Parental/code but it doesn't seem to hide the Apple Music Internet Radio button. I currently haven't found a way to hide this radio button.  strongEdit:/strong Hiding the heart column in iTunes is simple enough. Just right click the codeheart/code column in iTunes and scroll down till you see the codeLove/code option that's ticked.  <comment235591> Sorry to say, but I think these UI elements are baked into the app. I can't find any user preferences to remove them.
