Is there a way to get the mouse to automatically focus on an active window? <body> I have a dual screen setup and its easy enough to switch between active applications but I was wondering if there was a way to bring the mouse over to the other screen.   <comment198237> how would it know what is the "active" window? <comment198274> @Buscarì›ƒ, presumably in much the same way that LazyMouse can snap to the default mouse button in a dialog box. It's a matter of iterating through the windows to find which one has focus and then 'snapping' to the new position. That said, I am unaware of any utilities out there that feature such functionality.
