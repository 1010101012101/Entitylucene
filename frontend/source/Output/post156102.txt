Empty /home directory, and I can't delete it? <body> I have got a code/home/code directory with no content. When trying to delete it by codesudo rm -rf /home/code, OS X warns "rm: /home: Resource busy" and refuses to do it.   Tried reboot. codelsof/code returns nothing related.  Does anyone know why could this happen, and, especially, how can I remove it?  <answer156104> it is set up by the system for scenarios with network home directories, which are mounted at /home. we use network homes for a number of our Mac desktops, and, in our case, if a user has a home directory specified in Active Directory, and the AD plugin is set to use it, it will mount under /home.   my guess would be that the system doesn't allow it to be deleted because of that (at minimum).  <answer156105> /home and /net are both meta directories related to codeautofs/code &amp; code/etc/auto_master/code and part of the standard installation.  Please read more here: What are the home and net folders I see within finder?  <comment183607> thanks. I don't remember seeing these before...
