Mac OS and iOS Free Anti-virus etc <body> Is there any anti-virus that is free for Mac OSX that is like AVG or Avast for PCs?   Is there a malwarebytes version for Mac OSX?   Is there mobile anti-virus available for iOS like Avast etc. I am looking for anti-virus that is compatabile on both iOS and Mac OS X. I am not just looking for anti-virus for Mac OS X.     <answer229107> Yes, there is a MalWareBytes for OS X; however, it is currently insecure because of the Sparkle updater bug.
