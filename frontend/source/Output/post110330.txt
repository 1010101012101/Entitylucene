Equivalent of iOS' 30/30 (task manager) app for OS X <body> 30/30 is a slick task manager for iOS devices that's also free. I'm trying to find an equivalent app for OS X. Some of the features in 30/30 that I would like to see in a mac app are:  ul liClean interface/li liCycle a set of tasks ad infinitum (good for those long codecode-coffee-code-reddit-read-coffee-.../code cycles)/li liStart/stop/pause a task and adjust a task's time temporarily (e.g. +5/-5 mins)/li liFree or less than $5/li /ul  Does anyone know of such an app? Here's a screenshot of 30/30 on an iPhone.  http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/a8/7c/53/a87c5358-249c-309a-c743-d53be2a6104c/screen568x568.jpeg  <answer117137> There's the Reminders app in Mavericks, but you can also try Anxiety: http://www.anxietyapp.com  <answer182892> I use pushbullet to get the iOS notification show up to Mac. This way, you can still use 30/30 app on your iPhone, but get notification on your Mac.  <answer253951> I found an app called FocusList which I use to do a similar thing to 30/30, it lets you plan your day and tasks in order and go Pomodoro style through them one by one. It isn't quite as cute as 30/30, but gave me what I needed. It's under $5 so not free like 30/30, and it looks like you can only do things in 30m (25m + 5m break).  http://focuslist.co/  <comment129998> P.S. Some of the requirements can be relaxed, for reasonable definitions of "relaxed"...
