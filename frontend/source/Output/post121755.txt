how to configure Surfraw on OSX? <body> Has anyone had success configuring Surfraw on OSX? How do I get a working configuration for OSX? http://www.surfraw.org/  <answer121759> Surfraw 2.2.8 can be installed using either Homebrew or Macports.  Here's how to install via Homebrew. These commands should be typed within the terminal application:  strongInstall Homebrew/strong  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)" /code/pre  strongInstall Surfraw/strong  precodebrew install surfraw /code/pre  <answer121768> Once you've installed it (I used Macports) your code~/.surfraw.conf/code file should look like this, at a minimum:  precodeSURFRAW_graphical=yes SURFRAW_graphical_browser=open /code/pre  The codeopen/code command opens the default GUI application for whatever it's passed. In this case it's passed a http:// URL so it opens it in the default browser.  <comment141950> surfraw 2.2.8 is in both macports and homebrew - have you tried installing via those systems? <comment141954> It's installed, but when I run it, I get `/usr/local/bin/surfraw: line 470: /Applications/Google: No such file or directory`. I'm trying to figure out a working configuration. I don't have Lynx, so in my `.surfraw.conf` I'm using `SURFRAW_text_browser=/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome`, which should be the correct file location. <comment141976> How did you install? I used the above procedure, and when typing `$ sr google "foo"` it opens my default browser (Safari or Chrome). This is with no `.surfraw.conf` file <comment141982> I installed using brew. I just deleted `.surfraw.conf`, uninstalling, then reinstalling using `brew install surfraw`. Then the command again. Same result: `/usr/local/bin/surfraw: line 470: http://www.google.com/search?q=foo&num=30: No such file or directory` <comment141983> Tried installing with port. Same error, different directory: `/opt/local/bin/surfraw: line 470: http://www.google.com/search?q=foo&num=30: No such file or directory` <comment141987> I made some progress. I tried `sr -browser="/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari" google foo`. But this opens Safari with the url `file:///Users/peter/http:/www.google.com/search%3Fq=foo&num=30` <comment141990> It needed the extra line `SURFRAW_text_browser=open` <comment141991> Thanks for your help. It's working now. The config file needed the extra line `SURFRAW_text_browser=open` <comment142040> Do you have `SURFRAW_text=yes` somewhere in there? Mine works great with ony those two lines. Anyway, glad you got it running! <comment142085> It's strange, right? I did not have `SURFRAW_text=yes`. Don't know why `SURFRAW_graphical=yes` didn't work. Anyway, yes it's working, and thanks for the lead with `open`!
