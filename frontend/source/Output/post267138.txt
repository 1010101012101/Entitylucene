Sum yearly totals automatically <body> I am using a simple Numbers spreadsheet to track an expense that only comes up a few times per year. I want to be able to have Numbers automatically add the values that come from each year.  For example,  precodeColumn A    Column B    Column C    Column D DATE          AMOUNT    2015            $500 1/15/2015       $500    2016           $1000 1/15/2016       $500 6/15/2016       $500 /code/pre  In other columns, I would like Numbers to sum all Amounts from 2015. Then below that, sum all Amounts for 2016, etc.  I have tried playing around with codeSUMIF/code and codeSUMIFS/code and cannot seem to get it right.  <answer268093> ol liInsert a column between column A and B (you can hide this column after)./li liFill the cells of this column with the following formulae:  precodeYEAR(A2) /code/pre  The column should be A for all cells, and the row number should be incrementing, such that the cell being referred to is always the one immediately to the left./li liIn column D, fill the following formulae:  precodeSUMIF(Year,"=2015",Amount) /code/pre  Replace ‘Year’ with the column heading for the column you created in step 1.br Replace ‘2015’ with the year that you are looking to be summed for that cell./li liHide the column you created in step 1 (right-click on the column and choose Hide Column)./li /ol
