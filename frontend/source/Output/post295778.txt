Can't switch users from lock screen. Can't log in, stuck at password prompt for another user <body> My GF was using my macbook with an account I created for her.    I believe my account was still logged in.  The screen got locked (lid closed or whatever).    Now all I get is a password prompt screen for her username.   No way to select my username.  I tried restarting the computer.   Disk encryption is on.   The initial password screen (disk decrypt) screen is asking for her username's password.   No way to select any other username.  Can't have her unlock it because she's on a plane to Japan.  I suspect this has something to do with filevault.  <comment373557> yes it does has to do with filevault, so you will have to wait for her to land
