Installing OS X Yosemite from compressed DMG file in VMware Fusion <body> I would like to install OS X Yosemite in VMware Fusion 7.0.  If I select the DMG file my university is providing, VMware is unable to boot from the DMG file.  The image is a compressed DMG.  precodeProperties:     Encrypted: false     Kernel Compatible: true     Checksummed: true     Software License Agreement: false     Partitioned: false     Compressed: true /code/pre  Is there a way to make VMware Fusion boot from a compressed DMG?  I tried to convert to DMG to "uncompressed" or ISO with no improvement. I always get:  precodeEFI VMware Virtual IDE CDROM Drive (IDE 1.0) ... unsuccessful /code/pre  In the VMware log file I only see:  precode2015-08-12T09:44:42.586+01:00| vcpu-0| I120: CDROM: Connecting sata0:1 to '/Users/corti/Downloads/Yosemite (uncompressed).dmg'. type=2 remote=0 2015-08-12T09:44:42.587+01:00| vcpu-0| I120: CDROM: Checking initial physical media state... 2015-08-12T09:44:42.587+01:00| vcpu-0| I120: CDROM:  initial physical CDROM state is 1 (sense) /code/pre  <answer199895> It doesn't matter what type the DMG is as VMware Fusion cannot install OS X Yosemite by booting it or even booting the Install OS X Yosemite.app downloaded from Apple as that's not how it works in VMware Fusion.  VMware Fusion must first make an Installer Image from the Install OS X Yosemite.app and install from the Image it creates.  Have a look at: Installing OS X 10.10 Yosemite as a guest operating system in VMware Fusion (2082109).     To install Mac OS X 10.10 in a virtual machine using the Yosemite app   download:      ol   liSelect strongFile  New/strong from the Fusion menu bar./li   liSelect strongInstall from disc or image/strong and click strongContinue/strong./li   liDrag and drop the strongInstall OS X Yosemite/strong application into strongUse operating system installation disc or image/strong dialog box./li   liClick strongContinue/strong./li   liFusion should automatically discover the Guest Operating System. If not, ensure that the Operating System is set to strongApple Mac OS X/strong and   that the version is set to strongMac OS X 10.10./strong Click strongContinue/strong./li   liIf you want to modify any of the settings, such as memory (RAM), CPU, or hard disk size, click strongCustomize Settings/strong and specify the   non-default values./li   liClick strongFinish/strong. The installation starts./li   liWhen prompted, select strongReinstall Mac OS X/strong and click strongContinue/strong./li   liClick strongContinue/strong./li   liAgree to the license agreement and follow the prompts to begin the installation./li   /ol      After the installation completes, you must install VMware Tools on the   virtual machine. To do this, first eject the Mac OS installation disc   image from within the new virtual machine.

I created a bootable ISO to install it on VMware Fusion 8.0.1 by following the below steps as advised here.  precode# Mount the installer image hdiutil attach /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_app  # Create a ElCapitan blank ISO image of 9900mb with a Single Partition - Apple Partition Map hdiutil create -o /tmp/ElCapitan.cdr -size 9900m -layout SPUD -fs HFS+J  # Mount the ElCapitan blank ISO image hdiutil attach /tmp/ElCapitan.cdr.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build  # Restore the Base System into the ElCapitan blank ISO image asr restore -source /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg -target /Volumes/install_build -noprompt -noverify -erase  # Remove Package link and replace with actual files rm /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Installation/Packages cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/Packages /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Installation/  # Copy El Capitan installer dependencies cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.chunklist /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/BaseSystem.chunklist cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/BaseSystem.dmg  # Unmount the installer image hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app  # Unmount the ElCapitan ISO Image hdiutil detach /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/  # Create a sparseimage and auto-size it hdiutil convert /tmp/ElCapitan.cdr.dmg -format UDSP -o /tmp/ElCapitan hdiutil resize -size `hdiutil resize -limits /tmp/ElCapitan.sparseimage | tail -n 1 | awk '{ print $1 }'`b /tmp/ElCapitan.sparseimage  # Convert the ElCapitan sparseimage to ISO/CD master hdiutil convert /tmp/ElCapitan.sparseimage -format UDTO -o /tmp/ElCapitan  # Remove the unwanted images rm /tmp/ElCapitan.cdr.dmg rm /tmp/ElCapitan.sparseimage  # Rename the ElCapitan ISO image and move it to the desktop mv /tmp/ElCapitan.cdr ~/Desktop/ElCapitan.iso /code/pre  <comment240756> How did you convert it to uncompressed? Using `hdiutil convert` is the best option. I assume the DMG your university provided is actually bootable - have you tried booting it on real hardware? <comment240757> Did not try to boot with is as I do not have a physical CD-ROM. Is there another way to check if the image is bootable? <comment260574> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
