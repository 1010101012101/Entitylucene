C# programming on macOS <body> I am looking for a C# programming compiler on macOS that is a good value.   Could you give me any advice?  <answer295072> In April 2017, Microsoft released Visual Studio for Mac. Visual Studio strongCommunity/strong is free for students, open-source and individual developers.  It supports development of the following:  ul liMobile with .NET: Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS/li liMac desktop apps/li li.NET applications (in C# and F# by default)/li liASP.NET Web applications/li liCross-platform Unity games/li /ul  Minimum Requirements:  ul limacOS El Capitan 10.11/li liXcode 8.2/li liAn Apple ID (for signing into Xcode)/li /ul  For iOS development, macOS Sierra 10.12 and Xcode 8.3 are required.  <answer295076> The Mono project maintains a cross-platform C#/.net environment which works well on macOS.   http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/osx/  <answer295143> For compiler only I recommend to use .net core with editor of choice. I use VS code quite a lot, but you can use Sublime, Atom, etc.  As for IDE, I recommend to try JetBrains Rider instead of VS for mac. Unfortunately, it has only trial. It provides same functionality as VS for mac.  <comment372472> It also supports .NET standard, not just core. <comment372493> Visual studio is an editor and doesn’t really compile anything. Wouldn’t this be more correct to list Xcode alone for a compiler? I guess it depends how much the OP wants an environment IDE or really wants just to compile for free or low cost. <comment372542> Rider is version 1 as per date of my comment. Gratis for open source. Pay otherwise. <comment372645> @bmike You are thinking of Visual Studio Code which is just an editor. Visual Studio for Mac is a full IDE and includes parts beyond the 'editor' for compiling C# code that does not come with Xcode. <comment372657> Visual Studio Code's a good point.  @thaimin's correct that it starts off as an editor upon initial download, but it becomes a full-blown IDE after a few clicks (specifically, the clicks to download the C# compiler, syntax highlighting, project management, etc. add-ins, which are linked within the editor itself).  So, it can be called an editor, or an IDE that has incremental installations. <comment372672> Visual Studio for Mac also runs perfectly well with XCode 8.2.1 and macOS 10.11. I believe your quoted requirements only apply for [iOS development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/installation).
