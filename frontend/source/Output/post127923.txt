Apple Mail App Alternatives for os X <body> Can anyone let me know if there are any lightweight-Mail application for Mac OS X? Mail seems to consume too much of memory space  <answer127926> AirMail, PostBox, Thunderbird, Mailbox(Beta), MailMate, Mail Pilot, UniBox, Inky.  I personally like AirMail a lot and it is very cheap. But you are free to use any of those. There are actually quite a lot Mail-Clients out there.  <answer127933> Thunderbird stands out because it gives you access to dozens of community-developed extensions. Is there a feature you wish your program had? Go to the Add-Ons tab, search, and most of the time, there it is.   Here are some examples of features offered by Thunderbird add-ons:  ul liDisplay the sender's User Agent to see if he is also on a Mac or on Outlook :)/li liDictionaries in various languages/li liReminders  / event manager/li liClocks in status bar to know what time it is in various parts of the word/li liIdentity chooser to manage sending from various accounts/li liDuplicate message remover/li liSnippets/li /ul  The list goes on and on.  <comment149912> The trouble is that mails are now full web pastes and these require a lot of memory - unfortunately you can't set recent Apple's mail to just show a text version <comment149933> It's weird at times Mac-Mail takes nearly 1GB of Memory Space! <comment149936> That's interesting! Do you have any idea about how smooth is Thunderbird's integration with iCal? <comment149980> @Nariman No, don't know.
