How to tune Notes on OS X to use plain text or not to reformat quotes? <body> As technical guy, I do hate the markup support in Notes.app and I would prefer to be just a smart text one.  Here is my wishlist:    ul liUse a different font, like a fixed width one/li liDrop any font/color/size on text paste/li liPrevent replacing quotes with smart-quotes/curly-quotes (I like this while typing an email but not here where I copy/paste even code!)/li /ul  I suspect that some of these could be obtained using some hidden preferences options. Anyway, if you know other 3rd party applications that could replace Notes, let me know. Still I do not want to lose the ability to access notes from iOS!  <answer168501> h1Notes/h1  strongNotes.app/strong in OS X 10.10 can do all you request:  ul liFont colour, size, and family can be set through the strongFormat/strong menu./li liSubstitutions and smart quote behaviour are managed through the strongEdit  Substitutions/strong sub-menu./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5CWg.png" alt="Screen shot of Notes.app in OS X 10.10"  h2Beyond Notes: Text Wrangler/h2  If you need more than Notes.app offers, try Text Wrangler from Bare Bones.  <comment197786> what OS? Yosemite does all that.
