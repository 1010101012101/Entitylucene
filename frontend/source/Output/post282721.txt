Mail.app S/MIME Signing & Encryption with different certificates <body> How can I get Mail.app to use different certificates for signing and encrypting messages?  I'm using Mail 10.3 (3273) on macOS Sierra 10.12.4. I have GPG set up but also need to get S/MIME working for both signing and encrypting/decrypting messages. The challenge I'm having is that my organization has issued me two certificates for the same email address and I can't get Mail.app to use both of them.  One certificate has been issued for "Digital Signature" usage while the other has been issued for "Key Encipherment" (encryption) usage. To sign and encrypt a message I need to be able to use both keys. In Outlook I can manually choose which certificate to use for each purpose and everything works great. In Mail.app, I can send myself a signed/encrypted message but when it arrives Mail tells me that it is "Unable to decrypt message".  I've set a New Identity Preference in Keychain Access and checked my associated cert in Contacts but it looks like I can only have one certificate associated with my profile at a time.
