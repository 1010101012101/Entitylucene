Is is possible to fake a bonjour service identity? <body> I'm using Arq4 for backing up my data to a ubuntu server with ssh-access. Since Version 4 Arq supports SFTP storing. To speed up the inital backup process I attached my HDD to my Macintosh so Arq could copy the data locally. There is no way to change the SFTP target and maintain the Data and Configuration as seen in the Screenshots.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFxGo.jpg" alt="Screenshot 1"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lfZTl.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2"  strongTo workaround this issue I thought of faking the bonjour service identity, so Arq4 would be tricked into backing up to my Macbook. Any suggestions if this is possible or a better way to overcome this problem?/strong
