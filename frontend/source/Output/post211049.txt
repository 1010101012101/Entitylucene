How do I create a profile in Apple Configurator 2? <body> I'm trying to create a device profile with certificate settings for an iPhone. I have read the docs on profiles for Apple Configurator 2 but still can't figure out how to create a new / default profile. All the non-Apple documentation seems to be for the old version of Apple Configurator.  All I seem to be able to do in the UI is open a profile file, but I don't have any existing profile files.  strongIs there some folder that contains default profiles, or some way to make a profile from scratch?/strong  <answer211051> This is actually in the menu, just not the toolbar. strongFile/strong  strongNew Profile/strong  <answer231964> Visit:  Create Blue Print in Apple Configurator 2
