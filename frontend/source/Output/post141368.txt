HTTP connections fail after long sleep in 10.9.4 <body> I'm having a weird problem since upgrading to 10.9.4 - if it's asleep for a long time (I am not sure how long; short sleeps of an hour or less definitely don't do it, but overnight does) when it wakes up, HTTP connections don't work. I.e., the browser can't get content AND codecurl/codes in the command line fail:  precodehackintosh:~ barclayadunn$ curl http://www.yahoo.com -o yahoooutput.txt % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 --:--:-- 0:00:12 --:--:-- 0^C hackintosh:~ barclayadunn$ curl http://www.yahoo.com -o yahoooutput.txt % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 --:--:-- 0:00:18 --:--:-- 0^C /code/pre  It doesn't matter which browser I use (Chrome/Safari/Firefox). I can ping the destinations and get back content fine:  precodehackintosh:~ barclayadunn$ ping http://www.yahoo.com PING any-src.a03.yahoodns.net (74.6.50.150): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 74.6.50.150: icmp_seq=0 ttl=53 time=26.133 ms 64 bytes from 74.6.50.150: icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=23.235 ms 64 bytes from 74.6.50.150: icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=21.774 ms ^C --- any-src.a03.yahoodns.net ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 21.774/23.714/26.133/1.812 ms /code/pre  I have tried renewing my DHCP lease in the System prefs, no joy.   I've also tried resetting the ethernet connection via ifconfig:  precodesudo ifconfig en0 down sudo ifconfig en0 up /code/pre  So far the only thing that restores HTTP access is to totally restart my machine.  As you may have noticed I have a "hackintosh" - clearly the upgrade to 10.9.4 borked something in my rig. Don't judge me, please. I would greatly appreciate any insight.  BD  <comment166621> Do you see any errors or anything "strange" looking in Console.app? <comment166627> It looks like the app "Hidden," which I installed when I was on a laptop and which has ridden the wave from Snow Leopard to Mavericks, is failing over and over. I doubt that would cause this issue (but I've tweeted the app's devs to see if there's an update). I don't see anything else lately. But the next time this happens I'm going right there to look for evidence. Good recommendation, thanks.
