Scrolling does not register each click of the wheel <body> Whenever I scroll using my mouse, my computer does not register the small, individual clicks of the scroll wheel. I have to scroll much faster to make anything happen.  I have tried this with two different mice, the Razer Death Adder and Logitech G403, same problem.  Computer specs: iMac, Late 2012, 10.12.1  <answer260847> This site is very helpful and I discovered this post: Change the mouse wheel scrolling acceleration  It's exactly what I needed!
