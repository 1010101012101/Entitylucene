Mac Overheating Problems and Fan Noise <body> I have a old MB, which has Snow Leopard 10.6 Installed onto it. How can I fix the overheating and that fan noise? Whenever i open a large file or like install Windows 7 from Bootcamp, it would overheat and make some wind noises from the fan. It's a preety fast mac, i installed new RAM and just newly installed SL onto it. Can someone help me?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lx820.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer117276> The first thing that I would do is open up the case and use a can of air to blow out all the dust bunnies that have likely accumulated since the Macbook was first put into service; that will probably help quite a bit.  <comment137050> Yes did solve my problem kind of. Thanks. <comment137059> Glad to have helped.
