What does these extended attributes mean and where are they documented? <body> For some reason a directory I had (Vundle.vim) got randomly copied to another directory (got copied from ~/.vim to ~/dotfiles/.vim with strange permissions and what looks like no contents. Anyways, when I ran   precodels -l Vundle.vim /code/pre  I got  precodedrw-r--r--@ 11 root  staff  374 Aug 14 20:22 Vundle.vim /code/pre  and when I ran  precodexattr -l Vundle.vim/ /code/pre  this is what I got  precodexattr -l Vundle.vim/ com.apple.backupdelta.creationMarker: yes com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot: 00000000  62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 33 41 BB 7E B4 DA 00 00  |bplist003A.~....| 00000010  00 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| 00000020  00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| 00000030  00 11                                            |..| 00000032 com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot: 00000000  62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 33 41 BB 7E 82 12 00 00  |bplist003A.~....| 00000010  00 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| 00000020  00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| 00000030  00 11                                            |..| 00000032 inodeForCreationOriginal: 10315546 /code/pre  Can anybody tell me what this output means or where I can find that information (some sort of documentation)?  <answer200430> All commandline apps have an associated man page, that explain input and output, invoked like this:  precodeman [command] /code/pre  Where [command] is the command you want help on. So to find info on ls:  precodeman ls /code/pre  Also Mac OS is based on BSD unix and not completely different from Linux. So googling for the man page on almost any (BSD/Linux) unix command will also lead you to (quite possibly) more info that you can possibly digest...  <comment241506> I'm looking for an explanation for the xattr output. I've already looked at the man page for xattr, it doesn't explain the output. <comment241536> Each extended attribute is a name-value pair. The middle two attributes values are stored in binary xml format. It seems quite obvious that all these attributes are Time Machine related.
