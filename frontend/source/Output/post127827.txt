Stop windows from resizing automatically? <body> OS X keeps hitting a pet peeve nerve that I have, and it is normally happening with internet browsers.  I'll describe two examples:  ol liWhen using Safari, I am surfing normally on one web page. I open a new tab and the new tab bar shows up. The browser resizes to be larger by the amount of the height of the tab bar./li liWhen using Google Chrome, I start a download and the download bar pops up on the bottom. The browser window resizes to be larger by the amount of the height of the download bar./li /ol  For some reason this annoys me greatly. I resize and position windows in a way that helps me focus, I guess. It's an organizational thing.  This happens for multiple reasons and in multiple applications. The above examples are just to illustrate a point.  Is there a way to disable applications in OS X from changing sizes with me dragging the window edge?  <comment187324> I'm looking for the same thing
