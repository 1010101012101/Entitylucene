Will iWork '08 support autosave and versions? <body> Will iWork '08 work support autosave and versions? I really only use iWork like twice a year, and don't feel like buying a new one.   EDIT: Wait! It supports app resume though! Yay! Does all app support app resume by default?  <answer17935> I don't believe iWork '08 will support those features.   <comment19660> +1. Apple is very bad about updating older versions of anything. <comment19921> Damn... Ok then I guess I'll live without autosave for iWork for a while.. TextEdit will do for now.
