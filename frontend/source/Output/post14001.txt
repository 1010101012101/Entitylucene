How to turn off all animations on OS X <body> Is it possible to turn off all animations on OS X?  <answer14005> Animation is emeverywhere/em in OS X, and it is not possible to disable emall/em animation with one global setting, which makes this a very complicated question to answer completely.  I would advise you to try disabling things one at a time as you find animations that annoy you.  Check System Preferences to start.  For example, the Dock magnification animation can be turned off in System Preferences - Dock.  Also, check out TinkerTool, which allows you to do the following:  ul liDisable the animation effect when opening files in the Finder/li liDisable the animation effect in Mail/li liDisable the animation effect in Mission Control/li liDisable animation when hiding or showing Dock/li liDisable fade-in and fade-out effect,and animation when switching between pages, in Launchpad/li liDisable animation in opening windows/li liDisable the animation effect when opening information panels or Desktop icons/li liDisable the animation effect when selecting information categories/li liAccelerate the animation of opening and closing sheets/li /ul  If there's an animation that really bugs you and you can't figure out how to disable it, try posting a separate question here at Ask Different for that specific issue -- you will get a fast and accurate response.  (And as a nice side effect, both you and the people helping you will earn more rep that way.)  <answer63477> I have only enabled the first four of these, but here are all hidden preferences for disabling animations I have found.  precode# opening and closing windows and popovers defaults write -g NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool false  # smooth scrolling defaults write -g NSScrollAnimationEnabled -bool false  # showing and hiding sheets, resizing preference windows, zooming windows # float 0 doesn't work defaults write -g NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001  # opening and closing Quick Look windows defaults write -g QLPanelAnimationDuration -float 0  # rubberband scrolling (doesn't affect web views) defaults write -g NSScrollViewRubberbanding -bool false  # resizing windows before and after showing the version browser # also disabled by NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001 defaults write -g NSDocumentRevisionsWindowTransformAnimation -bool false  # showing a toolbar or menu bar in full screen defaults write -g NSToolbarFullScreenAnimationDuration -float 0  # scrolling column views defaults write -g NSBrowserColumnAnimationSpeedMultiplier -float 0  # showing the Dock defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0 defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0  # showing and hiding Mission Control, command+numbers defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0  # showing and hiding Launchpad defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-show-duration -float 0 defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-hide-duration -float 0  # changing pages in Launchpad defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-page-duration -float 0  # at least AnimateInfoPanes defaults write com.apple.finder DisableAllAnimations -bool true  # sending messages and opening windows for replies defaults write com.apple.Mail DisableSendAnimations -bool true defaults write com.apple.Mail DisableReplyAnimations -bool true /code/pre  <answer72931> If you're wary of Terminal, Mountain Tweaks is another helpful GUI to turn off, turn on and otherwise tweak the behavior of Lion and Mountain Lion.  <answer72940> In addition to the answers above, you can also use Secrets.

You can tweak the speed at which all of these boxes appear by using these commands:  Instant:  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSWindowResizeTime .001 /code/pre  Fast:  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSWindowResizeTime .1 /code/pre  Default (0.2 seconds):  precodedefaults delete NSGlobalDomain NSWindowResizeTime /code/pre  1 = 1 second. To see the difference you have to re-launch an app such as Terminal and summon a dialog box by pressing CMD+S ('Save') for example.

I can say pretty confidently that it's not possible to disable *all* animations in OS X, but there are settings for some of them (the Dock, for example). <comment14981> @Austin // Um..I want to turn off as many animations as possible like windows. I can turn off basically all the animation on windows.. <comment14984> There is no global option to disable all animation, and there is animation in nearly *everything*, so any reasonably comprehensive answer would be unreasonably long.  Are there a handful of elements you could mention that are particularly offensive to you? <comment98958> Could you please let me know if I should put this script in some particular file or in a new file/script which runs at start up to disable above animations <comment98960> You can just paste the commands to Terminal and they change the settings permanently. You also have to reopen applications or log out and back in to apply the changes. <comment168130> close the lid :) <comment169425> Lines beginning with a # are ignored in bash, so copying the entire code block from the first answer will do exactly the same as this anyway. <comment169439> True, but this text is easier to copy because there is no scrolling to do. <comment226419> so if we want to revert the changes we just need to negate every boolean and rerun this? <comment230897> To reverse the booleans (true/false), yes. To reverse the floats you need to know what the default values were. You can have the defaults printed to you by doing "defaults read domain key" ie: `defaults read -g NSWindowResizeTime` prints `0.001` (in my case). To get help run `defaults` in the terminal. I'll be updating my answer with a copy-paste list that will return everything to defaults. The world is small, isn't it Vachagan? :) <comment244089> Animation is very annoying (slow) when using RDP or VNC. Apple should provide a single checkbox to disable all animation - system wide. <comment279305> any chance any of these would get rid of or speed up the "swipe across" effect when tabbing between two different full-screen windows on a second monitor? <comment280938> That link is dead... Could anyone upload the app ? <comment281167> Secrets is dead. The backend is offline, so there are no more updates.
