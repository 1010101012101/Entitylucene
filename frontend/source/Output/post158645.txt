Recover certain files from Time machine from previous Mac <body> I just got my new Macbook Pro Retina and update it to Yosemite. I now want to recover/get some files from my Time Machine backup of my previous Macbook but don't want to migrate my whole Time machine onto my new Mac. So for example I want some folders from my Documents folder of my older Mac, but not the whole folder. And some specific Apps/Programs and not all of them.  I'm working on a Synology NAS so I don't have a backups.backupdb folder. I can open the network folder "Time machine" and there is my Computer name. But when opening I just find a list of files called "ff", "fe",... The main Computername folders are called computername.sparesbundle. So its not like the Machine drive &amp; file hierarchy. Is there any other option? When trying to "Browse Other Backup Disks" via Time machine itself it opens the Time machine "star wars" but shows my current working computer instead of the Time Machine backup.  Thanks in advance!  <answer158674> Open Time Machine  backups.backupdb  [ComputerName]  Latest   Once in there, everything is set out just like your old Machine's drive &amp; file hierarchy.  <answer205426> The following worked with my Synology NAS:  ol liBrowse to the network drive in Finder/li liDouble-click on the sparse bundle file for the computer you want to access.  /li liClick on the "Time Machine Backups" disk image in Finder (added to the left-hand pane by step 2 above)./li liOpen the codebackups.backupsdb/code folder inside this disk image./li liContinue as per previous comments./li /ol  <answer272312> Turns out I left my bitcoin wallet on my old machine...now that they coin is up to $1k again, I suddenly cared enough to dig and find my old wallet.  Here's the steps:  ol liAs Tetsujin says, just open through finder. /li liDrag the relevant restricted folder(s) to your local desktop. /li liCreate a user/pw that matches the old user of the time machine backup: system preferences -- users &amp; groups -- unlock -- (+) add standard user with appropriate user name (looks at permissions of the folder if you can't remember user name) -- guess the appropriate pw/li limove the restricted folder to the "new" user, and voila, in finder you will now be able to view all files./li /ol  At this point you could recursively chown the restricted folder to your typical user and move it back to your home. Or you could login as this new user and access the time machine directly (didn't try this).  <comment186517> Thanks for the answer!

BTW - add that info to the question - comments are ephemeral, the question & final accepted answer are what will remain for other people to Google. <comment186520> Thanks for your input. I will add the info to question. I've done a lot of research but didn't find the working answer. I don't would like keeping a clean install with some documents I need instead of A recovery from the previous. It's a supported way of Time Machine via Synology but apparently it's more common to just use a HDD instead of a NAS. Nevertheless thanks for your help! <comment186547> [Reconnecting to your backups](http://pondini.org/TM/B6.html).  Scroll down to the green box, “if your backups are on a network,” first. Proceed accordingly.
