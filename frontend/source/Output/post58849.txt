Why are there mainly entries of already uninstalled programs in the Console? <body> When I look into Console (/Applications...), I see a lot of entries that talk about programs I have uninstalled a long time ago, for instance  precode01.08.12 10:31:29   com.apple.launchd.peruser.502[206 (de.novamedia.NML2NDeviceObserver[58300]) posix_spawn("/Applications/launch2net/launch2net.app/Contents/ MacOS/NML2NDeviceObserver.app/Contents/MacOS/NML2NDeviceObserver", ...): No such file or directory /code/pre  The "launch2Net" was uninstalled some years ago! The same thing for "Carbon Copy Cloner", a program I tested some time ago... how can I avoid the causes for those entries? Is there a cleanup?  <answer58857> It's trying to start the nonexistent apps.  From the console entry codecom.apple.launchd.peruser.502/code we know it's trying to start on behalf of user (instead of system or administrator) that has UID 502.  You can get particular user's account name with codeid -u -n 502/code.  I'd look at following places:  strongLogin items/strong  Go to System Preferences-Users &amp; Groups. Choose appropriate user and select Login Items tab.  Look if you recognize uninstalled applications in the list and delete them. You have to select the app and press '-' beneath the list.  strongLaunchd/strong  Start the terminal. Enter codelaunchctl list/code and see if you find uninstalled apps in there. False entries can be removed by codelaunchctl remove label/code, for example codelaunchctl remove de.novamedia.NML2NDeviceObserver/code.  Repeat the process, but this time prepend codesudo/code to commands, like codesudo launchctl list/code, to catch all the apps executed in system context.  You can find out more about launchd and launchctl by entering codeman launchd/code and codeman launchctl/code.  strongLaunchd configurations/strong  Look into following directories (from codeman launchctl/code):  ol licode~/Library/LaunchAgents/code - Per-user agents provided by the user/li licode~/Library/LaunchAgents/code - Per-user agents provided by the administrator/li licode/Library/LaunchDaemons/code - System wide daemons provided by the administrator./li licode/System/Library/LaunchAgents/code - OS X Per-user agents/li licode/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/code - OS X System wide daemons/li /ol  If you find a file referring to uninstalled app, remove it (you'll need to codesudo rm/code for items in 3, 4 &amp; 5).  More about those files in http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html especially 'The launchd Startup Process'.  <comment67765> How did you uninstall them? Maybe this program has an uninstaller, and should not just be dragged to the Trash? <comment67766> I cannot remember :-) Maybe I used the uninstaller, maybe not... nevertheless, the entries are there ^^ <comment67806> Add /Library/LaunchAgents und /Library/LaunchDaemons to your list and be aware of different content for normal user and root ;-) <comment67828> I focused on user context because that was pointed in console entry you wrote. But, you're right, the answer should be broader. So I did it. Is it written clear enough?
