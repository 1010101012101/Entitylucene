Can two different App with the same name exist in App Store? <body> Is it possible I use same name but different icon for an App I sumbit to App Store?  <answer153573> No, the name of your app as it appears in the App Store must be unique.  When creating your app, you will receive the following error if you try to use a name that is already taken:     The Application Name that you provided has already been used. Please provide a unique Application Name.   But the name on the icon can be whatever you want - it can be the same as another app's icon name.  Source: Quora
