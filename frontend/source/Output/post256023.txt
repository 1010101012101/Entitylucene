macOS Sierra display low quality after logging in <body> Occasionally, perhaps once a week, after logging in, the display shows a very low quality picture for a few seconds, almost as if the system was tuned to very few colors or something similar.  As soon as I try to take a screenshot, the issue disappears. However, I've made a replica using photo editing software to demonstrate the issue.  Normal state:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kmpJ7.jpg" alt="Normal desktop"  Replica of the bugged state:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Kvk3.jpg" alt="Replica of bugged desktop"  I've looked through a few logs in the Console.app near the occurring time, however I'm not too sure what to look for and haven't found anything related.  I'm running strongmacOS Sierra 10.12 (16A323)/strong on a strongMacBook Pro (retina 13-inch, early 2015)/strong.br Additionally, the system display is configured to strongscaled mode/strong with the highest resolution option.  I haven't had the issue with scaling turned off, however, I would very much prefer to keep scaling on, as the screen-space is very valuable to me.  What could be the issue or how could I prove further diagnostic information?  <comment333453> Have you tried resetting the PRAM? That has helped me with glitches similar to these.
