Floating, transparent Mute Status for Call Center use? <body> We have a call center with agents taking calls with Bria. Due to limitations of the setup, Auto-Answer is the most convenient way of having calls connected. However, this creates a problem that agents are startled by incoming calls and have to constantly remember to mute their headset.  I was wondering if some sort of app exists to make muting less of a guessing game; if we could have a big transparent red floating icon somewhere on the screen to indicate that your headset mic is in fact muted.  Subtle menu or dock icons probably won't do the trick here, but feel free to suggest some for thoroughness, or if you can come up with another solution.
