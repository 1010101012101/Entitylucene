Text messages returning to original phone <body> Since updating to iOS6, every time I text my husband, the text comes to my phone. Any idea how to stop this?  <answer65551> Under strongSettings / Messages / Send and Receive/strong, remove the check mark from your husband's phone number.  <comment76626> I little more information might be necessary. Does your husband has iOS6 too? Does it give you any kind of error? Does it only happens with your husband? Is it a SMS or an iMessage? <comment78420> This might not be enough though. They might share the same Apple ID/iCloud account for instance... <comment78575> Is the text also going to his phone or does it only show up on yours? <comment86328> Are you actually texting your husband, or are you iMessaging him? In other words, is the text shown in green or blue in the Messages app? <comment91302> @patrix You can share the same Apple ID and have isolated iMessage.
