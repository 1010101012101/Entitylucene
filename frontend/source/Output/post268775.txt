Copy single file with I/O errors <body> I would like to copy a file from one disk (HDD with filesystem NTFS) to another (SSD with ExFAT, if it matters).br The problem occurs in the middle of the copy process, showing me the following message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x3OPF.png" alt="The Finder can&#39;t complete the operation because some data in &quot;File.data&quot; can&#39;t be read or written. (Error code -36)"  I have tried to use codecp/code, codersync/code and codedd/code without any luck.  The codersync/code command (with code--ignore-errors/code flag) throws me the following error:  precodersync: read errors mapping "/Volumes/HDD/File.data": Input/output error (5) rsync: read errors mapping "/Volumes/HDD/File.data": Input/output error (5) ERROR: File.data failed verification -- update discarded. rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/rsync/rsync-51/rsync/main.c(996) [sender=2.6.9] /code/pre  codedd/code just copied a partial data (the part before the problematic sector, without skipping it).  Any ideas how to copy this damn file?  <answer268803> Aside from codedd/code there is also codeddrescue/code although it's not a native OS X/macOS utility, however it can be installed in a number of ways. Personally I prefer to compile directly from emsource code/em however Package Managers like Homebrew can be used, or a precompiled binary if one is comfortable accepting a precompiled binary from an non-authoritative source.  Note that to compile from source code or use a package manager you need to have Command Line Tools for Xcode installed. You do not need to have the full Xcode installed, just the Command Line Developer Tools which are only a couple hundred megabyte vs many gigabytes.  The Command Line Tools for Xcode install can be started from Terminal with the following command:  precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  To use codeddrescue/code read its manual page, codeman ddrescue/code in Terminal, or online: GNU ddrescue Manual  <comment337521> Can you attach the disk to a Windows system and check/repair the filesystem from there? <comment337522> Sorry, it's not an option, as I have to buy a new PC and install a Windows OS. <comment337523> Besides, I can always connect a Windows and connect this disk to, but I'm trying to solve it from Mac/UNIX base system. <comment337524> What was the full `dd` command you used? Have you tried using `ddrescue`? <comment337525> Completely forgot about `ddrescue`! Will it work with a single file, like `dd` does? <comment337529> It works! @user3439894, please create a proper answer so I'll be able to mark it as a best solution. Thanks. <comment337747> “as I have to buy a new PC and install a Windows OS” Maybe it's easier to just install a [throwaway VM directly from Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/). But yeah, `ddrescue` is way better since probably you have some kind of hardware issues on that drive.
