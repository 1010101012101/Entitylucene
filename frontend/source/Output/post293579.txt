Recieving of a message makes viber go online in iPhone <body> I saw this recently that, my wife's viber status became online suddenly when a viber message got delivered to her phone. Her phone alerted and when I checked, her status was online for few seconds. Shes is having a Samsung Galaxy ACE2 and I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus.  I just want to know whether its same for other android devices and iPhone. (Mostly iPhone)
