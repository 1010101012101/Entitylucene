I can't access the Mac App Store, iTunes, or Software Update on Lion <body> I updated from Snow Leopard 10.6.8 to Lion. The OS update process was all right.  I can access the Internet by Firefox, but Safari.br I think my network is all right.  So, I can access the internet from Lion, but I canâ€™t use the Mac App Store, the iTunes Store or update my system.   How can I fix these problems?  <answer22702> Are you running an actual Mac or are you running a Hackintosh?  This is a known Hackintosh issue http://tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=135&amp;t=23153&amp;start=120  <comment21961> What happens if you go to the App Store? <comment21962> it does not have any error information, it stands in loading all the time, but the progress bar does not running. <comment22081> I found a error report about the app store: <comment22082> Yes ... do tell! Was it perchance "No GUID is available. Contact Support for assistance." in red font. I had that on my hackintosh, I deleted my .plist file in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist <comment23227> Do you still need assistance? What did the error report tell you? Have you tried another App Store account to make sure it's not a problem on the servers?
