How to drain an iPhone battery? <body> My phone froze last night and the battery still has not died. My lock and home button don't work, so I can't just hold the power button down and reset it. I'm on a friend's computer, so my phone isn't linked or whatever to this computer. Is there any other way to get my phone to turn off faster, since I emneed/em it for tomorrow.  It has done this before, but I had music playing and wasn't fully charged, but this time I was on my browser with a fully charged phone.  This happened over 26 hours ago.  <answer129523> If you happen to have strongFind My Phone/strong enabled on the device, you could try logging into iCloud or using the App from any other iOS device. This way you could, firstly, know the exact battery level and, secondly, you could trigger the locating feature which will help with the battery drainage.
