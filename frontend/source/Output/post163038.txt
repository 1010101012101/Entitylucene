Block web-page containing a specific word in Safari <body> I would like to know if there is any Mac Safari plugin to block any web page containing a specific word in its url or in its content.  For example, suppose we take the word 'abc', the following link must be blocked : wwww.dfrrraabc.com  A web page containing 'abc' in its content must also be blocked.  I don't know if a plugin like this already exists for Safari.  <answer222026> There is an open source extension for Safari named PeyvandhaBlocker to prevent loading an automatic page redirection based on IP (in the URL) and element type. You can get it and modify codeallowContentToLoad/code function in codeglobal.html/code file to take decisions based on URL or context of loaded web pages, and then edit the codecontent.js/code for the block action you need.  <comment190799> Yes, but… Note of caution: this seems like a bad idea. generally, you shouldn’t block domains based on strings within that domain. blocking `abc***`, `***abc`, or `*abc*` will block all sites containing the string `abc`. `abc`  needs to be really bad for you to do so. We’re only talking about domain names here - not IPs. <comment265952> To save others some time: I don't think [Adblock](https://adblockplus.org/) can block pages based on content, even with [custom filter rules](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters) (as [suggested elsewhere](http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/safari-keyword-filtering.1303569/#post-14113549)).
