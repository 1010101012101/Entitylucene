Is there an iPad text editor that supports c and Objective C and has an elegant dropbox sync solution? <body> I've been using Textastic and the Obj-C support is great but the Dropbox connection is kind of like firing blind — there's not really a way to tell whether the server or the iPad has the latest version, and you download/upload each file or a chosen folder manually.   I'm not going for a full on automatic super duper beyond-iOS sync here, just something that'll tell when I've got a newer file or something that changed server side before upload; it's hard to tell which ones have this approach since there are so many and many are for-pay.  What is a code editor with syntax highlighting for Objective C and a dropbox solution that checks for this?
