Cannot Install or Update Apps in App Store - Error 13 <body> I can currently no longer update or purchase software in the Mac App Store.  I have cleared Safari's cookie cache, cleared ~\Library\Caches\com.apple.appstore logged in and out again, but none of these help.  The error message is:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sWO0J.png" alt="enter image description here"  We could not complete your request. There was an error in the App Store. Please try again later. (13).  Anyone else experienced this? Any fixes?

So some sort of Prefs file is hosed in my main user. Does anyone know which one it would be?  <answer22251> I seem to have fixed the problem.  I used opensnoop to follow all file accesses while the app store was running.  I spotted that ~/Library/Cookies/com.apple.appstore.plist was being accessed - this file had not been deleted by Safari when I cleared all cookies! The file had incorrect permissions - I deleted it. Now the App Store seems to be working again.  Opensnoop is a great tool!  <answer49909> This post seems relevant: http://www.ryanragle.com/index.php?/site/comments/where-does-the-mac-app-store-download-temp-files-to  What worked for me in the end was this:  ol liPer post above, enable debug menu via   defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true/li liSign out /li liClear cookies AND reset the app, using debug menu /li liSelect Menu-Store-Check for unfinished downloads /li liWait for the downloads to finish and then /li lirestart the app store app./li /ol  <comment24616> Did you try creating a new user w/o admin privileges and try ?
