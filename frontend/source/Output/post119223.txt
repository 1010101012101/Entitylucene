how to change opencv library path <body> How to change path of opencv library. I have installed opencv using homebrew.  But when I run some opencv code it tries to link opencv library with my older version of opencv (in error below path is code/Users/Ashok/Downloads/opencv-2.4.6.1/code), but I have deleted this folder and reinstalled opencv using homebew.  precodeAshok$ python face_detection.py  OpenCV Error: Assertion failed (scn == 3 || scn == 4) in cvtColor, file /Users/Ashok/Downloads/opencv-2.4.6.1/modules/imgproc/src/color.cpp, line 3402 Traceback (most recent call last):   File "face_detection.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;     gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) cv2.error: /Users/Ashok/Downloads/opencv-2.4.6.1/modules/imgproc/src/color.cpp:3402: error: (-215) scn == 3 || scn == 4 in function cvtColor /code/pre  <answer119227> Have you "installed" python via homebrew. This doesn't actually install python but sets up a number of things so the built in python plays nicely with homebrew.  precodesudo brew install python /code/pre  This fixed a couple of these sort of problems for me when getting iPython working.  <comment139110> Still getting same error. <comment139111> Now it worked. Thanks for helping.
