How to stop can't connect to iCloud message from popping up <body> In this century I thought pop-up windows were dying out. But no, the following...  emThis Mac can't connect to iCould because a problem with "aa@bb.com"/em  ...window keeps popping up. How can I stop it? Even though I've already pressed "Later", after 1 or 2 seconds it comes out again! I am struggling for minutes to do things, and it is really annoying.   I'm running macOS 10.11.5.  Thanks!  <answer255262> That dialog is particularly annoying and persistent.  Providing a valid password is one way of stopping the dialog from coming back, though I find that when this occurs it is best to do the following:  ol liLog out/li liLog back in/li liEnter a valid password the first time this dialog pops up, OR enter the valid password in the iCloud page of System Preferences./li /ol  If I enter the password on the second, third, forth, etc. request, It seem that not all the things that wanted it get access to it.  If the problem is that you don't know the password, and have no way of recovering it, you might try deactivating or deleting the iCloud account from the iCloud page in System Preferences, then restart or at least log out and back in.  You can always add the account again later when you have the correct information.
