iPhone stuck in Recovery mode. Trouble restoring iPhone - what could I do? <body> I have an iPhone 3G. I am trying to restore it but have had trouble all day. This is what I have done so far:  ol liRun redsn0w 0.96b6/li liUse iPhone1,2_4.2.1_8C148_Restore.ipsw as the current firmware./li liRun redsn0w with default settings until the iPhone enters DFU mode/li liEverything from redsn0w's perspective runs great - the phone installs the jailbroken data, and reboots, as expected./li liI then open up iTunes and still get a "an iPhone was detected in recovery mode" error. My iPhone shows the frustrating image of the USB cable plugging into iTunes./li /ol  What could I be doing wrong? I'm at my wits end here.  Thanks.  <answer10581> A program called the firmware umbrella can be used to "kick a device out of recovery mode".  <answer16358> You have uninstall iTunes completely then reinstall it, then restart your computer for this to work. Then you put your device in DFU or recovery and restore and it should work.  If your baseband is 06.15 then you will get a 1015 error if your updating to 4.3.3.  <comment11027> related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9101/jailbroken-iphone-dead-what-firmware-load-options-do-i-have
