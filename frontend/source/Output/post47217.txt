Flashback malware on Snow Leopard <body> My Mac OSX Snow Leopard got exploited by the Flashback malware. There's a summary by F-Secure that I'm trying to follow in order to remove it. This link is similar, and provides a little more detail.  The first step is to type the following:  precodebash-3.2$ defaults read /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info LSEnvironment {  "DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES" = "/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLite \022@.xsl"; } /code/pre  This shows the malware. The next step is to do the following:  precodebash-3.2$ grep -a -o '__ldpath__[ -~]*' /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLite \022@.xsl grep: /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLite: No such file or directory grep: 022@.xsl: No such file or directory /code/pre  As you can see the file path includes code.NeroLite \022@.xsl/code and the space backslash combination has got me confused, and the system can't find the file. Anyone how I can locate this file? What is the code\022@/code trying to do? How to complete the next step?   UPDATE1  I've tried the following:  precodebash-3.2$ grep -a -o '__ldpath__[ -~]*' /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLite\ \\022@.xsl grep: /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLite \022@.xsl: No such file or directory  bash-3.2$ grep -a -o '__ldpath__[ -~]*' "/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLite \022@.xsl" grep: /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLite \022@.xsl: No such file or directory  bash-3.2$ ls /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.Nero* ls: /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.Nero*: No such file or directory  bash-3.2$ grep -a -o '__ldpath__[ -~]*' /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLit* grep: /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.NeroLit*: No such file or directory /code/pre  UPDATE2  I executed the following commands:  precode# sudo defaults delete /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info LSEnvironment  # sudo chmod 644 /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist  # defaults read ~/.MacOSX/environment DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES 2012-04-01 21:42:40.706 defaults[891:903]  The domain/default pair of (/Users/myuser/.MacOSX/environment, DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES) does not exist /code/pre  Which is good, according to the first link above.   THEN I REBOOTED THE SYSTEM. However, when I then try to start Safari, it won't start, but instead gives me the same old error:  precodeSafari cannot be opened because of a problem.

There are hundreds and hundres of files. However, none are showing with a dot in front of them (maybe the mac hides those files?). If I type: `ls -al /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/.N*` it says `no such file or directory.` <comment54110> try "defaults read ~/.MacOSX/environment DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES" <comment54115> I included this in UPDATE2 above. <comment54167> I did a full disk scan using ClamXav, and it didn't find anything bad. Mayber I'll try another product... <comment55289> More recent [Is my Mac infected with the Flashback trojan?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/48130/) has an accepted answer. If following answers such as those you find your system either damaged, or possibly infected, then I should [recommend reinstallation of the system](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/47235/8546). <comment96602> Cocktail can also search for *known* Malware  (http://maintain.se/cocktail)
