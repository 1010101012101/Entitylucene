Disable auto connect to other wifi only while at home? <body> I have a problem where my i-devices keep switching the wifi connection away from my home network, interrupting my LAN access.  It's not a precedence issue, where you can drag one wifi above another in the list, just sometimes it doesn't see my ssid right away and it connects to the faint signal from my neighbors.  Then it stays that way.br Also, the new Xfinity WiFi has installed a Configuration Profile, which specifies a few xfinity hotspot SSID's to have 'auto connect' attribute set to true.  It appears that this Configuration Profile takes precedence over all other wifi.  Is there any way to edit a configuration?  From what I can tell this is impossible to modify one that's already installed.  So, is there any way to set my home wifi's SSID to get extra precedence? Basically, set it so that no matter what if it ever comes within range of my home wifi, connect to my home wifi and no other.  There's gotta be a way!  Could I do it somehow by creating my own 'home' Configuration Profile?  I think this might be possible with the program Apple Configurator 2
