Duplicate missed calls in call log, and/or badge will reappear <body> I thought I was going insane, but I've started paying attention and this is definitely happening.   From time to time, I will get duplicate missed call entries in my call log. I'm uploading a picture as an example. Each of those calls happened only once, 3 minutes apart. In the log, I have the 4 entries you see in the screenshot. Two have the 10:49 time stamp, and two have the 10:52 time stamp. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EK1yG.jpg" alt="2x missed calls, 4 entries shown"  Another manifestation of this is when I have a missed call, and the phone icon has a badge. I'll check the missed call, badge will go away, only to reappear some time later (presumably in response to that duplicate entry showing up)  Searching around i found one post claiming it has to do with AT&amp;Ts numbersync, but I haven't found any ways to fix it. I've tried reset network settings/reset all settings with no luck.   Anyone have any ideas?
