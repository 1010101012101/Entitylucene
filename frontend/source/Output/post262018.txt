Mac won't show 'all my files' or 'documents' <body> My storage on my MacBook Air is almost full, and it says that my 'documents' has taken up most of my space, but when I try to manage 'all my files' or 'documents' to delete things I don't use, nothing pops up, literally nothing. So if anyone knows how to fix this problem please tell me asap.  <comment328275> Possible duplicate of [How can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5353/how-can-i-figure-out-whats-slowly-eating-my-hd-space)
