iPad wont charge in India <body> I am not sure why my iPad will not charge in India which I got in US. Did the power fluctuations kill the charging part or do I need to charge it in some other way? How do I test or find out the reason why the iPad wont charge? It was charging well for a year and now it does not.   I am using the charger for iPad and not the iPhone. Help me. Thanks.  <comment76780> What does the text on the charger say? Does it say anything like 220-240V? <comment77164> I took the US charger to India and it was fine for almost a year.. Now it is having the issue of not charging. When I connect it to a wall charger the green empty battery sign comes up, but wont charge. <comment77172> Your charger is dead. Buy a new one.
