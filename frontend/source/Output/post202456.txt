Can I connect my mini display port monitor with a Thunderbolt cable? <body> I wanted to go to the Apple Store and pick up a Thunderbolt cable, as they seem to be the only store in the area that has a mini display port (style) in the Thunderbolt cable. My monitor requires mini display port to broadcast at 60Hz at 4k resolution.  Will the Thunderbolt cable work in lieu of a mini display port to mini display port cable?  <answer202491> Yes that is possible!  But all you need is a mini-Displayport to mini-Displayport cable. Skip this upscale Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable. You'll find mini-Displayport to mini-Displayport cables much cheaper in other retailers.  For example Amazon..
