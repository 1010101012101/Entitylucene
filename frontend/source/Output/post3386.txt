How do I use multiple webcams at once on Mac OS X? <body> I have programmed a Flash app that makes use of several webcams at the same time. The app works great on Windows. When I try to use more than one webcam on Mac OS X, I find that each webcam I plug into the computer disables the previously attached webcam.  It appears that I can only have one USB camera working at a time. Is this correct? Is there any way of bypassing this?  <answer3420> There are Mac applications that can do this, although I don't believe that any of them run on Flash.  Here's some that I found:  ul liWirecast from Telestream/li liBoinxTV from Boinx Software/li liCamCamX from Black-Op/li /ul  They're all commercial, but there's a wide range of pricing between the three.
