Problem after cloning a Mac with dual boot <body> I bought an SSD to upgrade my MacBookPro (late 2011) and have cloned the HDD with CloneZilla. I have dual boot with OS X Yosemite and Windows 7 Pro.  However, now on the SSD, I can't boot into the windows partition. It doesn't show when I hold the option key, and if I try to restart with the windows partition as the target disk, nothing loads.  I have created a Windows startup repair disk using the HDD Windows partition, but it says that the version is not compatible.  Here are the outputs from a few commands which may be useful:   precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE   IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            400.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data Windows HD              99.2 GB    disk0s4 /code/pre  also  precodesudo fdisk /dev/disk0 Disk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 60801/255/63 [976773168 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55      Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE    0   0   1 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  976773167] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       *4: 07    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] HPFS/QNX/AUX /code/pre  and   precodesudo gpt -r -vv show disk0 gpt show: disk0: mediasize=500107862016; sectorsize=512; blocks=976773168 gpt show: disk0: Suspicious MBR at sector 0 gpt show: disk0: Malformed MBR at sector 0 gpt show: disk0: Pri GPT at sector 1 gpt show: disk0: Sec GPT at sector 976773167       start       size  index  contents           0          1         MBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  781249984      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   781659624    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   782929160        760            782929920  193843200      4  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7   976773120         15            976773135         32         Sec GPT table   976773167          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  Can this be fixed so I can boot into the Windows partition?  <answer202959> Your MBR table is messed up. One way to fix this would be to download and use the codegdisk/code command.  In a Terminal application window, enter the command codesudo gdisk /dev/disk0/code. If prompted, enter your login password. Next, enter the following commands. (If the line is blank, hit the return key to use the default.)  precoder h 2 3 4 y  n  n  y o w y /code/pre  An example of what to expect is shown below.

The operation has completed successfully. /code/pre  If after entering the codeo/code command, the values displayed do not match what is shown above, then a mistake has been made. In this case, enter an codeq/code instead of codew/code to quit without making any changes.

The simplest way is to use [WinClone](http://twocanoes.com/products/mac/winclone) or reinstall and restore a backup. <comment244586> The SSD and HDD are the same size. <comment244917> Thanks for the detailed response. I downloaded and used gdisk as you described; however, the windows partition still does not show when I hold the option key at boot time.  The output of fdisk is as you described.  Do you need any more information? <comment246200> My answer fixed one of your problems. If you are still not booting, you can try using [Startup Repair or bootrec.exe](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/927392). You need to insert the Windows 7 DVD and hold down the option/alt key at startup. Select the icon labeled Windows. Follow the instruction on the "Startup Repair or bootrec.exe" link. If you use bootrec.exe, choose the options /FixMbr, /FixBoot and /RebuildBcd.
