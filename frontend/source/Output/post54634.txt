iCloud server side wildcard mail rules <body> I couldn't find any information on how to set up wildcard rules in iCloud mail. I want to forward mail from any sender of a certain domain to another address.  What exactly is the syntax of the emmessage is from/em field?  strong@domain.com/strong or strong*@domain.com/strong?  Do I need to set up another rule to remove these messages from the inbox?  Thanks  <answer54635> For these cases I just use     from domain.com   with     move to folder   as the action. You don't have to delete it from the Inbox afterwards, the move takes care of that.  <comment62573> Are you referring to mail.app or icloud.com? I'm looking for a solution on the website. <comment62574> The above applies to rules on icloud.com (which are fairly limited anyway). <comment62583> Thanks! I was a bit confused as the rules cannot be rearranged in priority. So a *move* rule could theoretically make a *forward* never catching if set up higher.
