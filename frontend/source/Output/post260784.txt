Imac turn off the screen: where is the eject button to use in the shortcut? <body> I have a small wireless keyboard. Where can I find the eject button to turn screen off??  <answer260786> At the back of the screen. It's the same as the power button. There may be a setting to make this work.  <comment326524> Hi, welcome to Ask Different. What is the model and make of your wireless keyboard?
