How do I mount an Windows SMB server as a writeable volume on Lion? <body> When trying to mount an Windows file service over SMB (Samba) in Lion I get the following error when trying to write:  precode  % touch testfile.txt             touch: testfile.txt: Read-only file system /code/pre  This happens both when connecting via Finder or mounting in the Terminal.  precodemount_smbfs -f 777 -d 777 //david.hall@fileserver1/wwwroot remote Password for fileserver1:  /code/pre  I have no problem reading the files and my user do have permission to write to the directories in question.  <answer43620> I'm going to assume its windows server as you're mounting a wwwroot. Ensure your user david.hall has file permission access to the correct hierarchy not just share permissions. This is usually why stuff mounts as read-only from the win side.   OS X just mounts the share as normal unless you specify otherwise.   <answer174446> Add force user to the share in smb.conf.  (Change to the appropriate user name)...  precodeforce user = root  /code/pre
