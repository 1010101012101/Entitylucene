Can't boot normal or from recovery HD <body> Yesterday my MacBook Pro 15" Retina stopped booting. I see the Apple logo and a progress bar which gets stuck at about 10%.  What I tried so far:  ul liBooting in recovery mode - same, progress bar stuck at 10%/li liBooting in internet recovery - loads until a grey screen with the Apple logo. Nothing happens after that/li liBooting in single-user mode and repair disk with fsck - did that, didn't help/li liBooting in safe mode - works, I verified and repaired the disk with Disk Utility but the problem persists/li liBooting in verbose mode to see where the process gets stuck - booting proccess stops at various points each time. I tried googling all these steps where it get stuck but I always end up in hackintosh boards and blogs (OSX on PC's)/li liCreating a bootable USB disk (Recovery USB) and it also get stuck at the 10% progress bar/li /ul  I Was able to create a Time Machine backup in safe mode. So data loss isn't really the problem here. At this point i would wipe the disk and reinstall Yosemite if necessary. But without getting into the recovery HD I don't know how.  I do not have a second machine to connect to the MacBook so Target Mode isn't an option for me.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nY59L.jpg" alt="log in"  EDIT 1: After removing everything from startup the problem still persists.  EDIT 2: starting in verbose mode i now see kernel panic     panic(cpu 2 caller) "Spinlock acquisition timed out"   Kernel extension in backtrace: com.apple.kec.pthread   BSD process name corresponding to current htread: taskgated   EDIT 3: So booting in verbose over and over again it seems like booting stops alway either at kernel panic mentioned in EDIT 2, or at      IOBluetoothcontroller - start - loaded   or a new kernel panic that appears sometimes      "TLB invalidation timeout" "CPU(s) failed repond to interrupts, unresponsive CPU bitmam: 0x53, NMIPI acks: orgi: 0x0, now: 0x0"@7SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2782.1.97/osfmk/x86_64/pmap.c:247"    BSD proccess name corresponding to current thread: configd   EDIT 4: Found an App called Etre check which seems to be used in the Apple support community.

Unfortunately Disk Utility isn't robust enough.  What you need is an app to repair the directory.  DiskWarrior or something along those lines.  <answer265146> You could check to see if it's caused by Kernel Extensions, here's a blog tutorial I wrote after having somewhat similar issue myself:  https://smyl.es/how-to-fix-mac-osx-stuckhanging-on-progress-bar-will-not-boot/  <comment231803> When in Safe mode (that works) disable any and all apps that would be a part of boot process (all 3d party apps). Anything that would auto start including any virus scanners. <comment231806> http://i.snag.gy/XZQEh.jpg these are my login items... <comment231807> Thank you, so just kill all those, you do not need them anyway. <comment231823> Could you run the Apple hardware test ? <comment231833> Since i was able to backup all data using Time Machine and booting in safe mode i decided to download Yosemite and created an installer USB for a clean re-install of OSX. Booting from this USB has again the same result. Im stuck at the Apple logo with the progress bar. Pressing D on the keyboard while rebooting (for the diagnostic) gives me a screens where i can chose language and then restart or shut down. I again just get to the screen with the progress bar and no diagnostic is run.. <comment231837> Maybe it helps to apply the 10.10.4 combo updater in Safe Mode. Unplug all ext. devices. <comment309981> Welcome to Ask Different!  We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.
