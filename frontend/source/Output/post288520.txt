Accidentally deleted boot drive (d:). Unable to start in to OSX or Windows <body> I accidentally deleted my OSX boot drive. Is there anything I can do to recreate this.  I have tried to boot in to Windows which it now directly goes to rather than OSX but I get the error "Unmoutable Boot Volume". When I go in to the internet recovery it states: "You can't change the startup disk to the selected disk."  If I go to reinstall OSX, no drives appear where I could install OSX. Please help.  <comment364346> Please boot to Internet Recovery Mode, open Terminal in the menubar  Utilities, enter `gpt -r show disk0`, take a pic of the output (or transfer it via ssh to another host) and add it to your question.
