Why is my address bar in safari doing this? <body> Randomly my safari just started doing this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChJBq.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried recreating the codecom.apple.Safari.plist/code file but nothing changed. Whats up with this?  <comment273390> Servers were borked yesterday. Was a world wide issue <comment273391> You say it "was" does this mean it's fixed because I still have the issue. <comment273392> It hit all the newspapers yesterday, the same links are now saying it's fixed. <comment273402> @Tetsujin I still have the issue so it's not fixed. <comment273410> Have you rebooted your computer & router? <comment273411> @Tetsujin Yes, multiple times. I don't see how this would even be an internet problem.
