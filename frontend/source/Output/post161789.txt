Mac OS X Lion 10.7 Server.app Missing <body> Server.app got deleted and it was not able to find it in the backup to restore that app. How to I get this back? I says my system is still Lion Server but I need the Server.app to control some services via GUI. I wanted to start the time machine service so if someone know a command line way that is also fine.  <comment188986> If you open the App Store app, does it show up in your list of purchases? You should be able to re-install it from there. <comment188990> Not able to see it on the App Store. I only see the latest version which is for Yosemite. <comment188991> You may have to call Apple, as they don't list Lion Server in the App Store any longer.
