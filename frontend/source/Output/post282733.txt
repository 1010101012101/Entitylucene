Log in as different user without logging out <body> Is there a way to log in as a different user, leaving all of my open windows and running apps as they are?  All I can find is a way to log off, and emthen/em log on as another user.  <answer282735> You can perform Fast User Switching.     Switch by using a password      ol   liClick the fast user switching menu in the menu bar, then choose your user name.      The fast user switching menu looks like either a user icon or the name of the current user, depending on the setting in Users &amp; Groups preferences./li   liEnter your password, then click the arrow./li   /ol   macOS Sierra: Switch quickly between users  If Fast User Switching is unavailable, it can be enabled by an administrator.     If your Mac has multiple users, an administrator can turn on fast user switching to let more than one user stay logged in at the same time. To switch from one user to another without logging out, users choose their name from the menu bar, and then enter a password or use Touch ID.
