Remove Location circle from Maps <body> Maps on OS X 10.10 has an annoying blue circle (around current location?) which obscures the detail you are trying to view. How can I turn it off  <answer161597> The blue circle is apparently where codeMaps/code thinks the WiFi I am using is located. Turning WiFi off removes the circle, allowing the image to be viewed.  This may require another (Ethernet) connection to view images.  <answer178725> You could do this by disabling access to your location for the Maps app.  This is done in strongSystem Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  Privacy/strong.  Select strongLocation Services/strong in the left panel and make sure strongMaps/strong is unchecked in the list of apps allowed to use your location. This should remove the Current Location marker from the app without disrupting your access to the internet or preventing other apps using your location.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IAWdB.png" alt="OS X System Preferences: Security &amp; Privacy Screen"  <comment187723> Want more details ?
