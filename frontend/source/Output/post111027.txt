Battery diagnostic tool at Apple Genius Bars <body> I have a one-year old iPhone 5 and it's battery performance has dramatically decreased over the last few months. As I could use my iPhone for over 24 hours a year ago, the lifespan has halved by now.    I'm not interested in the reason why or answers like "emit's normal/em", but in the following. A friend of mine told me Apple has a diagnostic tool at it's Genius bars to check the health of the battery. Is this a rumor or is the tool real? And if so, can it be bought by  consumers (I don't thinks so, but you never know :))  <answer111044> It is real. One of the Genius perform the diagnosis right in front of me. If memory serves, it goes like this:  ol liWith your iPhone, or whichever iDevice, connected to the Apple Store's wifi, "Apple Store", open Safari, and connect to URL "diagnosis.apple.com" (or diagnostics)/li liA page will show up, with a text entry bar for the Genius to enter a verification code./li liThe genius will pull up a page from his "Genius" iPod touch, (the one with bar code scanner), and possibly clicked a certain icon, which leads him to the verification code. I assume that the verification code is changing over time./li liAfter entering the code into your device, there goes the diagnosis page./li /ol  In the brief moment he was looking at my iPhone, I was able to see the maximum capacity (by design) and the capacity left, which is 98% in my case. By this figure he will determine whether your iPhone's battery needs a replacement. If not, he will suggest that you restore the iPhone and the battery issue (if any) will likely go away.  I asked the Genius whether that's a secret page, he just calmly answered that it's just a tool for them to do the diagnosis.  So no, you cannot purchase it, as it is simply an internal webpage which requires Genius verification.  hr  As a side note, informed by the same Genius, the easiest way to tell whether your battery/system has problem with battery life is to go to codeSettings - General - Usage/code in your device.  Look at the "Time Since Last Full Charge" section, it tells you how long the device has been used and how long it has been on standby. If the two figure are very close, e.g. 2 hours for usage and 2 hours 10 minutes for standby. But you clearly remember that you haven't been "using" the device for 2 hours, but only let in stay in sleep mode. This means that something running in the background is draining your power, and your device is never sleeping.  In this case, the Genius will suggest that you restore the iPhone (and restore from iCloud or iTunes if you wish) and the problem will most likely go away.  ==============  strongUpdate/strong  After visiting the Genius bar again, I saw a genius helping a customer on similar issue and I took a picture.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/ITxow9d.jpg" alt="genius iPad"  Instead of connecting to some normal URL in safari, a link in the format of "diags://#####" would be generated and visited by the device in question.  <answer116171> https://getsupport.apple.com/Issues.action  You can run the diagnostics tool there. My phone has been randomly shutting down when it still has around 20 - 30% battery left, and after running the diagnostics tool it said my iPhone 5 has a 'Power issue'.   It doesn't give much more information than that, but I have an appointment at the store this week. I'm not sure what they will do, as I've had it now for just over a year.  <answer120415> You can get access to the diagnostic data that the iOS Diagnostics tool sends by following these instructions: http://www.lyonanderson.org/blog/2014/02/06/ios-power-diagnostics/  There's a lot of data to through, but you may find something useful.  <answer122768> The iOS Diag tool is an internal installed app, it displays information such as thermal information, intensive battery information (deeper on iOS 7), call drops, crash reports a few other things that aren't customer facing knowledge.   Mr Rabbit's description is spot on. its also only available on the Apple instore wifi  <answer122805> You can get the battery information that the Apple Genius gets by installing iBackupBot.  ol liOpen iBackupBot/li liPlugin your iOS device/li liSelect your device under Devices on the left brimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQC5k.png" alt="Devices"/li liSelect More Information/li liSee Battery details - your battery is in good health if codeFullChargeCapacity/code (health of your battery) is near codeDesignCapacity/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aSLwK.png" alt="Battery diag details"/li /ol  <answer128143> I was having the same standby and usage time under Settings - General - Usage and found a report like this when connecting my iPhone 5S to Xcode:  precodeIncident Identifier: 941F209C-EC9B-49B8-B796-F9B07543E9ED CrashReporter Key:   182e9824ae5047b9b2f2fe5e88777bc89fd945ec Date:                2014-04-19 02:48:06 -0300 OS Version:          iPhone OS 7.1 (11D167)  locationd: com.apple.locationd.NetworkProvider.15fd3dec0    NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:03 backboardd: quicklookd[204]-com.apple.mediaremoted.relayxpcmessage [0x17826f4c0] NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:06 backboardd: Music[285]-com.apple.mediaremote.sendremotecommand [0x17007e380]     NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:06 backboardd: Skype[129]-Called by Skype, from unknown method [0x1702708c0] NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:02:32 backboardd: BriaVoip[132]-132 [0x17026e780]     NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 11:01:09 SpringBoard: com.apple.springboard.idle NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:17 dataaccessd: com.apple.persistentconnection[dataaccessd,100,2B8234AA-88C3-4010-BEED-C4C6DB1FC7BC-PendingSimpleTimer(0x1310cb150)] NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:04 apsd: com.apple.apsd-outgoingmessage NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:03 mediaserverd: com.apple.audio.pid-16.keypress.isprewarmed NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 00:00:06 mediaserverd: com.apple.audio.VAD Aggregate Device UID 15.isrunning NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 05:35:14 mediaserverd: com.apple.audio.AudioSession-132(com.counterpath.bv).isplaying NoIdleSleepAssertion == 255, held for 09:42:08  Hardware Model: N51AP Awake Time: 27:14:44 (98084) Standby Time: 27:14:44 (98084) Partial Charge: 1 Capacity: 0 Voltage: 3370 mV /code/pre  I don't know if you can force this report to generate, but it was very helpful to determine that Bria (a VOIP soft phone I need for my work) was preventing the device from sleeping, even after rebooting the device. So I force quit the app and now my battery isn't draining overnight.  <answer142324> I was experiencing some of these same issues and first phoned apple support. Informed them that I've used their products since their daybue and that I was knowledgable on all of the trouble shooting options. The tech made an appointment and I went to my local apple store. My phone has been replaced once back in July of 2013 for similar issues and was just within the one hear warrenty. The replacement only comes with a limited 90 day warrenty. I explained my situation,they ran the diagnostic test mentioned above and determined I have had some apps crashing consistently and that my battery was nearing the end of it's life cycle. I was very kind and accepted the information he relayed to me. I also didn't accept no for an answer. He said he could replace my iPhone 5 64gb phone for $250.00. I told him this was not an option and they the apple care tech told me my phone would be replaced in store. The store genius told me to hold on a few moments while he went in the back... I waited for nearly ten minutes and he returned with a phone and said he would replace it. This occurred two weeks ago and I am one happy customer. Thanks Apple!  <answer144647> Users running jaibroken devices can find this information using an app from Cydia called BatteryLife.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Rwje.jpg" alt="BatteryLife"  <comment130703> This is mostly correct.  The Genius basically initiates a ticket, which creates a ticket number.  The customer then visits diags://1234 (assuming ticket number 1234) on their iOS device and the built in diagnostic app is launched.  The diagnostic app runs and relays its report back to Apple's system, which the Genius can then check. <comment130718> This is an excellent answer! Thank you very much! <comment130863> Actually, in the US I've gotten self support from Apple's web site and it generated the ticket number automatically for me. You can of course call AppleCare or visit AppleCare in the stores (which is the genius staff) to run the diagnostic as well. It's a service, so short of buying yourself a self-servicing account you will need to get Apple to initiate each test. <comment135908> What happens is if the tool says your hardware has a problem or the battery is "in the red" in terms of capacity remaining, they offer a replacement and inform you of the cost. The warranty pays for some battery repairs and not others. It's detailed in apple.com/legal for the country where the device was sold. Generally, you pay if the battery made it to the expected life or it's outside the coverage period. <comment140860> I having the same problem with my iPhone. I tried the steps shown above, i opened up apple store and opened the safari. input the dianostics.apple.com or diagnosis.apple.com but the browser is saying "safari cannot open the page because the server cannot be found. <comment140862> @Cris You don't enter "http: //diags" - enter "diags://43252" or whatever somewhat random ticket number Apple enables for your diagnostic run. You can't just run this without them enabling a slot for your test results to get analyzed. <comment168368> Apple has announced a program to replace batteries from early iPhone 5. You should see if your phone's serial number is included. <comment170258> Generally linking to answers is frowned on here as the site can go offline, instead you should post the details and list your source. <comment170260> This can be found in the `LowBatteryLog` file in General - Settings - About - Diagnostics & Usage - Diagnostics & Usage Data from your iOS device. <comment170376> iPhone 5 battery replacement details can be found at https://www.apple.com/support/iphone5-battery/ <comment170544> http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1615150 might might have some useful details on potential issues you'll find in the battery log file. <comment191192> @bbodenmiller This is a good idea! I don't have that particular log on mine, but I'll try to drain my battery to about 1 or 2% and see if the system generates it. <comment191194> Got to love kind helpful people! `:)` <comment200813> There is a known issue with iPhone 5 batteries to visit the following site to check if your phone has a dodgy battery !! https://www.apple.com/uk/support/iphone5-battery/ <comment248375> Just tried. Doing that it sends a text with a special link, however it doesn't let you view the results it just sends them to apple and then you have to either click the button to call apple (Which costs money, or send in for support etc). Based on this thread sounds like in the past they showed the results on screen where is now they just send them to apple so they can diagnose. <comment325492> I used this earlier this year, but now it is no longer working. Anybody could use this method ???
