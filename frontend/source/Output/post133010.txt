Replaced Ipod video hard drive and battery, now won't start. Did I accidentally kill the hard drive? <body> As I said in the title, I've been trying to revive an old 5th gen ipod video. I replaced the hard drive, screen, and battery.   At first it wouldn't boot, only giving sad ipod error. Then out of nowhere I managed to get it to start. I succesfully formatted it with itunes and synced music, but the last few songs ended in an error. Looking at my ipod I only saw 4 songs. When I played them I only had sound in 1 ear, so I figured a cable was still loose. So I opened up the ipod and reseated the cables.  Now my ipod only changes between "very low battery", dark apple logo, and the sad ipod error. I can't seem to get it into disk mode or diagnostic mode. Did I accidentally kill the battery? What can I do?  <comment157531> it is difficult to retrace a workmanship steps you took, but obviously the problem originates from there. redoing them with care could help. <comment157575> I agree that it probably has something to do with my repairs. I have tried many times to reset all the cables, but there has been no change so far. Any ideas how to troubleshoot the problem further?
