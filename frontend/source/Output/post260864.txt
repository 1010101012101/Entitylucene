What Bit Encryption does Apple Use on Mobile Devices? <body> Apple Encryption Question: I know if you have the iPhone 3GS or later version, an iPod touch 3rd generation or later version, or any iPad, the user can employ encryption to protect the contents. My question is specific, does any one know what bit encryption Apple uses?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TaBaD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer260866> As per page 11 of the iOS Security Guide:     Every time a file on the data partition is created, Data Protection creates a new strong256-bit/strong   key (the “per-file” key) and gives it to the hardware AES engine, which uses the key to   encrypt the file as it is written to flash memory using strongAES CBC/strong mode. (On devices with   an A8 processor, strongAES-XTS/strong is used.) The initialization vector (IV) is calculated with the   block offset into the file, encrypted with the SHA-1 hash of the per-file key.    emEmphasis mine/em  <comment326623> Stack Exchange sites prefer that you not put self-promoting text or links in your questions.
