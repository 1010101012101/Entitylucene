Message tone played multiple times on receiving message/notification on iOS 5 <body> I've an iPhone 4 and I've installed iOS 5 on it. Since then, whenever I receive a text message or an app notification, the tone plays like "tre..tre..tre..tre..te..tre..tre...tring". Sometimes it takes a whole 5 to 7 secs for the sound to be complete.  At first, I thought it's because of the beta; but I guess they should've fixed it by now as it is already some Beta 3 if I'm not wrong!  Does anyone know any settings change/fixes that can fix it?  <answer29286> Ok, I had the exact same issue after updating to IOS 5, SMS tones sounded like a stuck record and very garbled. Solution is back-up your iphone then do a complete restore and at the end set up as a new iphone NOT backup from previous. The back-up can cause glitches when 1st updating from 4.3.5 to 5. Then unplug and plug back in and right click your iphone and do a "restore from back-up" after the setup as new iphone. Hope that helps for you as it did for me.  <comment31110> Have you tried changing the text tone to something else to see if it's a problem with all of them? <comment31237> I Changed the tone to some other one. When I receive a text message, it works fine but when I receive a push notification from an app, life facebook push notifications, the same issue stays. <comment31241> Is it the exact same ringtone for notifications, I've not properly been through all of them but it sounds like a new default one in the system. <comment31509> I changed the sound to chime but when I receive a app push notification, the old tri-tone is played. When I receive a text-message, the Chime tone is played though. <comment32612> Yup, happening to my 3GS too. Sounds like the tri-tone has a stammer, starting and stopping. I haven't found a fix other than to keep on silent mode. <comment32763> My sms alert tone (IOS 5) also seems to have issue. The tone repeat itself (as if like a broken record or stammering) multiple times when i receive any sms. <comment32934> There used to be an option on 4.3 how often you want an alert sound to play. That option is gone in iOS 5. Bug? <comment33799> The most important part of this process is setting up as a NEW iphone at the end of the restore. <comment57715> `settings  general  reset  reset all settings` fixed it for me.
