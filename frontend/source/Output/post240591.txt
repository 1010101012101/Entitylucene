How do I remove "smart quotes" from an existing document? <body> I tried removing the smart quotes using the procedure outlined in this SE question, but nothing seems to have happened.   <comment295764> Is your question about a new or existing doc?  When I go into *TextEdit* on an existing doc, highlight the text, and remove *SmartQuotes*, nothing happens.  New text is affected, though.
