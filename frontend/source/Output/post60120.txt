For a startup volume encrypted with Core Storage, System Preferences show that FileVault is disabled <body> My iMac has a SSD and a HDD. The OS is installed on the SSD.  I performed a clean installation of Mountain Lion to the SSD, and cloned my SSD using a backup from my Time Capsule in OS X Recovery.  System Preferences show that FileVault is not enabled.   When I follow the routine to enable FileVault, after the iMac reboots it gives me the following error:     strongThere was a problem enabling FileVault./strong   Problems were encountered with the disk “Crucial M4 SSD”. Please turn off FileVault, verify and (if necessary) repair the disk with Disk Utility, and try enabling FileVault again.   I have verified and repaired the disks in Disk Utility. I used Disk Utility in OS X Recovery. Here I was unable to unlock the volume on the SSD with Disk Utility, so instead I used Terminal to unlock the volume. After the unlocked volume appeared in Disk Utility I was able to verify and repair the disk, but I still got the above error.  Results in Terminal:  ul liwhen trying to decrypt the volume, I am told that that the volume is not encrypted/li liwhen trying to encrypt the volume, I am told that the volume is already encrypted/li /ul  – very confusing :)  precodeDenniss-iMac:~ dennis$ diskutil coreStorage decryptVolume 4FDED44E-EC4B-4B11-9FF5-9C958BD8CEAB Passphrase: Error beginning CoreStorage Logical Volume decryption: The target Core Storage volume is not encrypted (-69755) /code/pre  -  precodeDenniss-iMac:~ dennis$ diskutil coreStorage encryptVolume 4FDED44E-EC4B-4B11-9FF5-9C958BD8CEAB New passphrase for existing volume: Confirm new passphrase: Started CoreStorage operation on disk2 Crucial M4 SSD Error: -69696: The target Core Storage volume is already encrypted /code/pre  h1Questions/h1  How can I enable FileVault on my iMac?
