Is SDHC Card compatible with a MBP mid-2009? <body> I have a Mac Book Pro, mid-2009 model that has a SD card slot. I just bought a SD Card from SanDisk, 8gb, SDHC.  When I insert the SD card in the slot, it is recognized by the MBP: I have a new icon on the desktop, codeNO NAME/code, and the disk utility tool shows me the information related to the disk and displays a correct volume size (around 7.95Gb).  In the Disk Utility Tool, when I click on disk verification, I get the following information:  precodeVérification du volume « NO NAME »Vérification du système de fichiers** /dev/disk1s1 ** Phase 1 - Preparing FAT ** Phase 2 - Checking Directories ** Phase 3 - Checking for Orphan Clusters Free space in FSInfo block (-1) not correct (242303) Fix? no 0 files, 7753696 KiB free (242303 clusters) /code/pre  Unfortunately, the Disk Utility Tool does not allow me to format the SD card.  The purpose of this SD Card is to use it to boot a Raspberry Pi. So I downloaded their utility codeSDFormatter/code. This utility recognizes the SD Card, but when I try to format it, it tells me that it is write protected.  Of course, the physical lock on the SD card itself is on the correct position!  So my question: is my old MBP compatible with this kind of SD Card?  Thanks.  <answer125750> It finally seems that my MBP is incompatible with this SD card format or size.  I bought a multi-cards reader, and it works.  Note that the exact same behavior on a 2010 MBP.  <comment146939> It seems your not the only one. Maybe try some of the solutions here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3275447?start=0&tstart=0 <comment146963> Thanks @KevinGrabher I will have a look on these discussions. <comment146965> Unfortunately, my problem persists. I don't have the exact same issue as on these discussions. They don't succeed to mount the SD Card. I can, but it's on a read-only mode, and I can't format it to use it.
