Where do I find an iPhone 4's MEID (ebay purchase)? <body> I'm looking to buy and repair an iPhone 4 from eBay, however the seller hasn't stated the status of the MEID. There are pictures posted of the phone and I can see the back, I read in another question similar to mine although specific to an iPad that the number is engraved on the back. Is this also true for the iPhone 4?  Update: The phone doesn't turn on and it does not have the sim tray. Is there any other way to find out the MEID number?  <answer140006> The MEID number (the first 14 digits of the IMEI number) is inscribed on the SIM tray on iPhone 4 phones.  It is also available in Settings - General - About as "IMEI" (just ignore the last digit).  More information including photos here: iOS: How to find the serial number, IMEI, MEID, CDN, and ICCID number.  <comment164974> Thanks, but like I mentioned I'm trying to buy the phone of eBay, so I can't actually check the sim tray. <comment164977> You could leave a question for the person auctioning the phone. Ask them for the number or to take a photo of the number. Unfortunately the number is inscribed on the back of some iPhones, like the iPhone 5s, but not the iPhone 4 for some reason.
