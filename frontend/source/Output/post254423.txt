How do I disable "rich links" in Messages in Sierra? <body> I don't want every link I send through iMessage to be accessed and embedded inline. I can't find a preference setting or defaults key to turn this off.  In this example image, I would want the YouTube link to be sent as a bare link, not a movie + screenshot: img src="https://i.imgur.com/YlvHuYW.jpg" alt="Example"  <answer254429> That can't be disabled, it's part of iMessages.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206894  <answer255974> You can add a dot (.) in front of the http before sending it. That should send the link as a link instead of a "rich link" strong./stronghttp://bla.com  <comment316757> Paste without style. <comment316792> @Iron I think you're confusing iOS/macOS and rich links in Messages with rich text? <comment316800> Everything on that page is also annoying, but I'm specifically targeting rich link expansion, which isn't mentioned. <comment316806> It isn't mentioned specifically, true.  Also not mentioned on the Apple sites I visited was how to disable it (apart from turning off iMessages and just using SMS).  I suggest letting Apple know you want this feature: http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html <comment316832> I guess that's the best I'll get. <comment319684> [It doesn't.](https://i.imgur.com/v0kK4XR.png) <comment345295> It works if you add text (or a dot) both before **and after** ( . http://bla.com/ . )
