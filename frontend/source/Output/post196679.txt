Using Automator to call a Service <body> I use save my PDFs to my Evernote account.  I would like to automate this process at the end of the day.  Can I use Automator to call the existing service "Add to Evernote" at the end of the day?  <comment237665> PDF's generated from where? You may want to move them to a folder with a folder action attached that runs the Evernote action. A little more information regarding your workflow would be helpful.
