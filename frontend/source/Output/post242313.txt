El Capitan - when is the last iPhone backup? <body> h2How do I tell when my last iPhone backup was?/h2  In previous versions of iTunes  ul lithere was a info panel available when selecting my mounted iPhone in the left sidebar  ul lithis panel showed all kinds of useful information!/li lifor example, when the last sync/backup was!/li /ul/li liNow there isn't.  No info./li /ul  h1Q: I've backed up my iPhone by right-clicking and choosing "Back Up."  But how do I tell when the last backup is from?/h1  h2Q: is there another place (app?) to find the iPhone's status?/h2  For example, strongImage Capture/strong has basically replaced Photo for managing the photos on the phone.  <answer242314> The panel is still there and hasn't moved.  ol liSelect your iPhone in the toolbar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dJrcq.png" width="347"/li liThe latest backup times and locations are shown under Latest Backup.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U9mx8.png" alt="Latest Backup"/li /ol  The version of iTunes is independent of the version of OS X. Image Capture has by no means replaced Photos and was part of OS X long before iPhoto (the predecessor to Photos.app).  <comment298017> Aha!  Thanks!  I didn't know that about Image Capture.  My complaint about Photos still stands, however.  I'm glad Image Capture is there for my scenario!
