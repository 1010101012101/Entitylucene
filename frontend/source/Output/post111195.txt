Black borders with external monitor on MBA 2013 <body> I have a problem that I'm not able to fix. I'm getting black borders, some king of margin. The display doesn't use the full space in the monitor. I have a total of four monitors in my house and three TVs. I only get this problem with one monitor.  Note that I don't have this problem with my Mac Mini with the exact same monitor... only with my Macbook Air. I tried to plug the monitor with TB-DVI and with TB-HDMI. Same problem. I tried to switch cable. Same problem. I have a DIAMOND USB 2.0 DVI ADAPTER, and when I use it, I don't get any black border.  I have no "overscan" setting in the System Preferences.  My monitor is a I-INC iH282. There is no settings in the menu to adjust overscan or something like that.  Any idea why it does that? I spent my two last evening trying to find a solution on Google.  Thanks in advance!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zYvx.jpg" alt="Black border problem"  <comment182460> Did you ever get to the bottom of this?
