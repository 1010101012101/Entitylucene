Remove a single tab on a new Finder Window (Yosemite) <body> I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem? It's kind annoying, and I can't figure out how to fix it.   THE PROBLEM IS whenever I open a new finder window, it also creates a single tab that I can't close. This tab takes up some screen space and is kind annoying. I can't figure out how to make it go away. I've looked in View Options and Finder Preferences.  Here is a picture:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GT7er.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210535> kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd T /kbd will show/hide the tab bar (if there is not more than one tab already).  It appears that if you close a Finder window with the Tab bar open, then subsequent window will start with it open, even for a single tab.    So I guess the trick is to always close tabbed windows one tab at a time, or remember the above key-combo for when you forget.  <comment254105> Thank You! I'm not much of tab-user <comment254106> Me neither... ;)
