Any REAL good Mac/iPhone combo IM applications out there? <body> I am looking for a combo of two IM applications, one for the strongMac/strong and the other for the strongiPhone/strong. The main features I am looking for are as follows:  ol lisupports strongMSN (Microsoft messenger)/strong/li lihas strongPush Notifications/strong on the iPhone/li lihas a strongunified session/strong (will explain below)/li lidoesn't have stupid bugs (Trillian will not let you copy with âŒ˜C)/li lidoes not ask me to email someone that is invisible/offline (instead of messaging)/li /ol  strongUnified session/strong - I want the two apps (iOS and OSX) to share the same session, so when I leave the one and fire up the other, it should have my chats already there, exactly as I left them on the other device.  I have tried Meebo and Trillian thus far.  strongMeebo/strong not being a Mac application did not feel right (not even when I applified it using Fluid) but its unified session (in the cloud) was pretty good. The iOS app was good.  strongTrillian/strong is a great application on both iOS and OSX but has some stupidities built in (like the emcopy to clipboard/em bug I mentioned earlier).  strongWhat I'm actually looking for is something better than Trillian./strong  PS: since I'm a developer, open-source is a plus  <answer13849> I'm not sure about the unified session requirement - I've never seen that in any IM client.  However, I find Adium (http://adium.im/) is the best Mac IM application (and it's open source!).  As for the iPhone, have you considered IM+ (http://www.shapeservices.com)?  It works quite well for me.  <answer20902> You stated that you've looked at Meebo, and it has worked fairly well for me, though I've found IMO.im to work better for unified sessions. Again it's not a Mac app on the desktop, but you can pop-out the session and get a semblance of a native application.  <answer70779> Have you heard of SkyChat?  It's pretty awesome, and it works on both iPhone and Mac. I use it all the time!  Plus, as a developer, I know that the nuts and bolts in this open-source bad boy are up to scratch.  <comment14770> I'd guess there isn't any and I'm surprised Meebo is that good. <comment14773> Adium is good on its own and IM+ is good on its own. There is no inter-compatibility though. There is no way to do what Trillian does, which is to open a chat with the one (let's say iOS) and have it running on the other as well (OSX). It's the single most important feature of Trillian for me. <comment14809> Skype does this, but 1) it's awful, 2) doesn't support MSN :( <comment37789> Trillian is the only option, but the Mac app drives me crazy <comment37805> sounds nice and I will probably try it to see how it is performance-wise <comment82217> While self-promotion is acceptable per se (http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#promotion) it provides more value if you can show why/on which features your app is better than the alternatives.
