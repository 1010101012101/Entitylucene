iPad app on MBA maverics <body> Compatibility question I want to download the BBC iPlayer from the iTunes store on my Mac Book Air (10.9), but it is only available for iPad or iPhone as shown here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQFBG.png" alt="iTunes storee"  Can I still somehow use it on my MBA ?  <answer120365> h3You can't./h3  IPAs downloaded from the App Store are built for the ARM processor in actual iOS devices. Even if you signed up as a developer which would give you access to the iPhone Simulator, it's not an emulator and can't run ARM code.  The only way you can run iOS apps on OS X is if you have the iPhone Simulator and have a version of the app specifically compiled to run on the simulator.  <comment140395> thanks, ill keep looking for a alternative solution
