Force installing untrusted Safari extensions <body> Before Safari 9, I was able to install any extension on Safari without any problems, but after Apple updated its Developer Program, it seems that I can't install extensions not already signed by Apple and in Safari Extension Gallery. I had two untrusted extensions installed and working, but had to remove those and I can't install them again.  I'm still having hope, because when I double click the extension file, Safari shows me a dialog like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wrcYJ.png" alt="Safari screen shot"  But nothing happens when I click on codeTrust/code. It just dismisses the dialog and won't install the extension. Is there any way I can install this extension?  <answer214948> So after contacting one of the developers of an "untrusted" extension, they pointed out that this can be done normally in safe mode. You can boot your Mac in safe mode by holding down kbdShift/kbd when booting.  Beware that your Mac performs really slow in safe mode, so download the extension you want to install before booting in safe mode.  This is the Apple Documentation page which points out there's no need for all extensions to be hosted on Safari Extensions Gallery.  <answer233701> Copied from: Safari 9 - I cannot install extensions   To install a em.safariextz/em file, go to:  ul liSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Keyboard   (for OS X 10.11.4+)/li /ul  or  ul liSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Full Keyboard Access   (for OS X 10.11.1 to 10.11.3)/li /ul  Then at the bottom of that dialog box, change the emFull Keyboard Access:.../em option from emText boxes and lists only/em to emAll controls/em. You can then dismiss that System Preferences window.  Then, return to installing the extension. Double click your Safari Extension file and when the em"Are you sure you want to install.../em" dialog box appears, strongdo not/strong click on the emTrust/em button. Instead, use kbdtab/kbd to select the emTrust/em button and then confirm by hitting kbdspace/kbd. That should install the extension as required.  <answer253497> Try using the tab key to select "trust" and the space bar to click it. For whatever reason, this works for me.  <answer261116> This problem also exists when using macOS Sierra 10.12 with a remote desktop client (like VNC). The solution is to install the extension directly on the physical machine.  Not sure about other version of OS X.  <comment286158> I am on 10.11.4  and there is no  Full Keyboard Access in Shortcuts <comment286412> On 10.11.4 it's now just called "Keyboard". The rest of the instruction is still fine. I'll update the answer itself. (But what a *bizarre* solution to the problem! Thanks Ruud!) <comment292087> I've had to revert, for a second time, inappropriate cosmetic changes. Can we please just leave it as it is. My intention was to have the SysPref path instructions stand out, and to also make sure the OS X version dependency stood out. Also, I explicitly mention "mouse-click" to emphasize that *not* using the mouse is the essence of this workaround. <comment320151> At first, I assumed this answer was false, but I actually had the same issue and solved it by confirming the dialog using my keyboard. This requires keyboard accessibility settings to be reconfigured. See https://discussions.apple.com/message/29328892#29328892 <comment369974> Why is it that way? I mean, that can't be an expected behavior. <comment369993> @Nemo64 I wish I knew. Perhaps it's something that's broken with my profile, or installation. Haven't had a fresh install to test it though.
