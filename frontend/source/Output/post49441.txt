How to recover deleted voicemail from iPhone 4S? <body> I have the iPhone 4S. This morning, I had 2 unheard voicemails. I attempted to listen to them but no sound was delivered and the progress bar did not move. A few minutes later I looked down and my messages were no longer there. Is there any way to recover these deleted voicemails?  <answer49465> If you did actually delete the voicemail, a new cell should have appeared if you scroll to the bottom of your voicemails.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pgZIg.png" alt="Voicemail"  Then, tap on Deleted Messages, and you should get this screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N3bjX.png" alt="Deleted Messages"  Now, tap on the voicemail that you would like to delete, and press Undelete:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFXU5.png" alt="Undelete"  Hope this helps!  <comment102942> Do any of these answers help?
