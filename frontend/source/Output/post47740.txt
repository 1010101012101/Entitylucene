Can I make mobile Safari open YouTube links in the browser? <body> YouTube has a pretty decent mobile website, however any link to YouTube I see on the web always opens the link in the YouTube app, not there in the browser.  Is there a way to change that? It would be nice not to have to keep switching apps all the time. I checked in Settings and couldn't see anything. Echofon actually does it in its built in browser so I'm sure it must be possible.  <answer47748> This doe not seems to be able to fix via a simple setting or something. This topic at iMore says it used to be a beta-feature that has been taken out.   Appearently it has been asked at StackOverflow before, and in that topic it was suggested to edit the URL manually:  <answer60238> Go to Settings  General  Restrictions and untick the Youtube button. After that Youtube links will open in Safari and the app icon will disappear from the home screen.  <answer92511> You can also manipulate the URL to solve this problem.  By directing away from codewww/code and towards codem/code, this video link shows what to change:  ul linormal link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMed79/li limobile link: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SMed79/li /ul  :)  <answer193467> Disable youtube app background refresh   <answer200061> Okay so I found a fix that seems to work. You go to a new tab in Safari and paste this:  codehttps://m.youtube.com/code  Then it will take you to the app. Close the app, go back to Safari and enter the link again. A pop up will come up asking if you want to open it in the app. Click cancel and then enter the link a third time. YouTube should load and work like normal on safari. Hope this helps!  <comment54775> Does "Open in New Tab" not work? I'd test it, but I'm not able to at the moment. <comment54816> @timothymh No, when I press and hold the URL, the only options that come up are "open in YouTube" and "Copy". <comment54863> How about "Copy" and then going to that URL directly? <comment69390> Thanks! I forgot I'd asked this question - I'd actually found this exact solution elsewhere.
