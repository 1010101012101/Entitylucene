Running a Script with Platypus <body> I am trying to run a bash script with Platypus but I cannot get the script to copy the bundled .app file to the applications folder. I am new to creating scripts and packages so any help would be appreciated. I am saving the file as login.sh - not sure if the .sh file extension is the correct one.   precode#!/bin/bash  sudo cp -R PrintServer.app /Users/$USER/Applications/  osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to make login item at end  with properties {name: "Print  Server",path:"/Users/$USER/Applications/PrintServer.app", hidden:false}'   osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to display dialog "Installation  successful please hit the next button"' /code/pre  This is the return I am getting, it appears to complete but there is not PrintServer.app file in the applications folder  img src="https://i.gyazo.com/54f7052ce27c9071f35ec17e17d36288.png" alt="Click Here for image"  Thanks
