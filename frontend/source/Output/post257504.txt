Migration Assistant not recognizing ethernet <body> This is a self answer question of which I will answer and accept this evening unless someone else comes up with somthing better!! (let the competition begin!)brI figured this should be written somwhere so anyone else suffering from this will have help.  h2Allright,/h2  I am currently migrating from a MacBookPro to a desktop. The desktop is running Sierra and the MacBookPro is running Yosemite.brThe desktop is a late 2013 (I think) and the MacBookPro I'm not sure. (I think it's 2010 perhaps. can't check because it is currently migrating).  Anyhow, they both have Ethernet ports and I have successfully plugged in an Ethernet cable between them. (complicated task, I know)  However when I use codeMigration Assistant/code, it always falls back on wifi, and says it's going to take 155 hours to transfer. I know the Ethernet cable is good, hence I'm using it currently (remember I already figured it out) and I was not able to connect using wifi.  h3Any Help?/h3  Or am I going to have to write and accept my own question (It feels dishonest).  <answer257525> h2Okay, here we go/h2  It's a simple answer, so...  After wasting hours of time trying to figure this out I realized that codeMigration Assistant/code is not smart enough to set up the Ethernet connection itself.  I had to go into System-Preferences-Network and add and manage the Ethernet.  I then turned off the wifi, turned on file sharing, and was able to see the other computer coming from the other side.  Even though all the tutorials I had read said "just plug in the Ethernet cable and go" (in my own words), I still had to set it up manually. Oddly enough, the MacBookPro didn't even have the default Ethernet settings.  Hope this helps someone else!  <comment321559> If you have an ethernet switch/router with two or more ports, use that instead of a direct connection.
