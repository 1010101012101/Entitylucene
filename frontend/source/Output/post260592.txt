Mac Sierra won't boot - SmartBattery: finished polling type 4 <body> I did an update on my Macbook Retina 13" to the most recent version of Sierra OS X. The computer never gets past the Apple logo (black screen with a full progress bar).   I booted into Verbose Mode (command + v) and see that it is stuck at the following point:  SmartBattery: finished polling type 4  Every now and then it will add another line of text (same text) but it never moves beyond that point.  Any advice please! It is a real pain to keep restoring from my Time Machine backup!  <answer260802> Recover from backup only with apps and user data solve the problem.  <answer261133> Someone in our office had this exact problem this morning. Managed to get it working again by resetting the SMC (System Management Controller).  Hope this helps someone else in the same situation.  strongTo reset your SMC./strong      strongIf the battery is nonremovable/strong      ol   liShut down the Mac./li   liPlug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your Mac./li   liUsing the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same   time./li   liRelease all keys, then press the power button again to turn on your Mac/li   /ol      strongIf the battery is removable/strong      ol   liShut down the Mac./li   liDisconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the Mac./li   liRemove the battery.

Not convinced the battery is really the issue as the machine will boot   quite happily when using another boot disk or USB drive and the   SmartBattery checks in those boot logs are really no different. To me   it looks like the boot process has hung at the kextd and the endless   SmartBattery messages are the OS just passing the time waiting for a   response to the kextd daemon its never going to get.      Your (and my) problem is because auf a KEXT file which is not   compatible to 10.12.2 - the software isn't clever enough to ignore   this, so you have to do it yourself. There are some ways. I made it   this way:br   Start into Recovery HD, Open Terminal, write down:    precodemkdir /Volumes/"Macintosh HD"/kextbackup cd /Volumes/"Macintosh HD"/System/Library/Extensions /code/pre     look for .kext files which are not part of the normal system   precodemv KEXTNAME.kext /Volumes/"Macintosh HD"/kextbackup/ /code/pre     I removed the following and after this the system booted again.   precodeBelcarra.USBLAN_netpart.kext Belcarra.USBLAN_usbpart.kext HuaweiDataCardDriver.kext JMicronATA.kext RemoteControl.USBLAN_usbpart.kext UsbEthernetGadget.kext USBExpressCardCantWake_Huawei.kext vecLib.kext /code/pre     Of course everybody   has his own not compatible kext files in this folder. Actually you   can't do anything wrong by just moving them to another place... But I   would recommend you not to move any of the APPLE*.kext files and the   IO*.kext files. Other files with not that normal names, I would move   and try to start.... At the moment my Sound is not working.. So I   moved one kext too much, but anyway... I can write this.. in Safari on   my Macbook Pro Retina....   EDIT: This worked for me. Note that I also had no sound but got it back after moving back "vecLib.kext" (by again returning to recovery mode and moving it back from the kextbackup-folder), so try to keep that in place from the beginning :)  <comment326297> Try booting in Safe Mode (hold Shift while booting) <comment326320> Try booting without a battery <comment328025> With verbose mode, the last message is often not the true cause of the problem. Reboot in verbose mode, and post some pictures (with a camera) of the output. <comment339190> This did not help me, same situation as OP. Also tried resetting NVRAM and repairing the internal hd. <comment339191> I got the same problem and resetting the SMC did not help. Before the polling, it says: busy timeout[1], (60s), kextd wait(1): *here about 4 lines with around 20 random characters each" <comment339195> Is this for the update 10.12.2 ? If so, then an outline to a solution might be found here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7787207?start=0&tstart=0 Source: https://www.apfeltalk.de/community/threads/macbook-2012-nach-sierra-installation-eingefroren.509600/ <comment339200> This will probably "solve" it since you will not restore the incompatible kext-files in the new system, but it is overkill and should only be used as a last resort or in case there is noone around that can use the terminal and follow instructions. <comment360386> I only had 4 of the items in the list and removed 3 of them (except for vecLib.kext) and that fixed the issue. My Mac starts again! So no need to try to remove other kext files for me. <comment370180> This worked for me. I only had to move 2 ktext files: JMicronATA.kext and HuaweiDataCardDriver.kext -- BTW I've used Mac for 12 years and it's the first time mine died after an update. Apple are really going downhill! Really considering to stick to Linux. <comment370183> This didn't work for me. I even re-installed OSX from recovery and boot still failed. The accepted solution worked.
