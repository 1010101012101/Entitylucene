How do I subscribe to an RSS feed in Mavericks? <body> I would like to subscribe to some RSS feeds. I originally had them in Mail, which worked just fine. But after upgrading to Mavericks, the RSS feeds disappeared, and I get this message when I click on an RSS feed link:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fIfMa.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How do I subscribe to an RSS feed, if this won't work?  <answer112455> Tbodt I would recommend using Pronto Push app exclusively for OSX Mavericks!  strongGet Desktop Notifications From any RSS Feed in Mavericks Using Pronto Push/strong     http://www.mactrast.com/2013/10/get-desktop-notifications-rss-feed-mavericks-using-pronto-push/   <answer117538> As noted in the comments, Apple dropped support for RSS in Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8). You'll need a third-party RSS reader. Once you get one, you can get a emsubscribe/em button in Safari by installing Red Sweater's unsupported Safari Extension.  <answer124390> An option you might look into is Feedly. They have a Safari plugin (and probably other browsers) and work well enough.  <comment132025> RSS support was removed from Mail and Safari back in Lion (10.7), I think. You'll have to use a third-party app like [NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com). <comment132114> @daGUY I was using Lion before Mavericks, and it worked. <comment132115> Apparantly, Pronto Push is [temporarily unavailable](http://www.prontopush.com). <comment132118> You're right, it was [Mountain Lion that removed RSS from Mail](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/07/os-x-10-8/9/#mail), not Lion. <comment137340> Update: Not anymore. <comment145496> Per the above re: ProntoPush - they went out of business. Just an FYI. Well we gave it another try but unfortunately managing Pronto Push has taken up too much time and money. Thanks again to all the beta users!&mdash; Pronto Push (@prontopush) <comment184179> And now it looks like you're back, back yet again?
