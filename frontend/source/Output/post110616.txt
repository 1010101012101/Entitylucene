OS X Mavericks Screen brightness auto adjusting even when option is disabled <body> Now I know from trying to find an answer to this to go uncheck the auto adjust box, since apparently it got checked when I updated to Mavericks, but now it seems my MacBook Pro has a mind of its own and still feels the need to auto adjust when I'm not doing anything.  I made sure 10 times at least that the auto adjust box wasn't checked, and it's not. So why is my Mac randomly doing this? (and btw, this only started today, and I got the update on the first day it was available)  <answer110623> Are you sure?   System Preferences - Displays - Display - Automatically adjust brightness  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/62QHQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzq2Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer120333> I had the same problem - have just downloaded this ap and fingers crossed, it seems to be holding the brightness levels steady.  http://www.resexcellence.com/2013/01/29/control-mac-screen-brightness-with-shady/  <answer120367> I was just struggling with the same issueâ€”it really annoyed the hell out of me. What helped me was a good ol' SMC reset:  See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964 on how to do it.  <answer132482> I found that disabling "Automatic graphics switching" in the "Energy Saver" system preferences dialog fixed the problem (at least temporarily).  EDIT: Later in the evening, when I wanted to keep my brightness low, the bug recurred, then spontaneously disappeared again.  <answer194480> It may have to do with your charger.br I had the same problem; look at your charger, the lights probably keep changing from green to orange to nothing. When you plug in your adapter it automatically adjusts your brightness, the bad contact makes it do this over and over again.  <comment140396> Having this issue and unchecking the box doesn't help! <comment140398> The OP said she made sure 10 times it wasn't checked, and you ask "are you sure?"... hmm, are you sure?
