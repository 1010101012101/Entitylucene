Missing email attachments <body> I have a Gmail account but access all my email through Apple Mail. I noticed in the last month or so that I'm not seeing the attachments that are being sent to me. In order to access the attachments, I have to open up Gmail through Safari. How do I fix this problem?   <answer36967> Have you made sure that these selections are checked? Having the incorrect option selected can produce the very symptoms you're describing.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ebiwq.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AneP2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment41738> You should provide a screenshot of the `Mail.app` interface, and of a message that should have an attachment. <comment41740> What do you mean by "not seeing the attachments"?. Do you not see their previews, or do you not see any indication of them at all - which leaves you to take notice of them from the context of the mail. <comment41741> No I don't see any indication of the attachments except for the content of the email alluding to the attachment. <comment41744> Screenshots! Bonus points for the same message in the gmail (web) interface. <comment42547> I have the exact same problem with another IMAP server. I'm pretty sure it is a bug in Mail.app. I also have attachments disappearing, when I move a message from one folder to another. On server side the attachement is correctly moved with the attachment. I believe there is nothing you can do but wait for Apple to fix it.
