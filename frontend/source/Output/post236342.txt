How can I back-up my OS X instance and Restore from mounted drive? <body> strongSynopsis/strong  I have been having trouble With my MacBook Pro em(Mid '12, 15")/em  I deployed tonnes of work Sunday evening/early hours Monday morning before I went to bed, leaving my MacBook running but locking screen.  Monday evening I returned home to do my personal weekly finance reports and start some work, where I clicked my mouse to get the screen on but it was white and nothing worked.  Simply a colour-wheel spinning infinitely.  ul liI held the power button for a hard shutdown and turned it back on/li liThe system booted up normally/li liI logged in and shortly after my MacBook started up all my desktop applications /li liWhen I pressed kbd⌘/kbd + kbd_/kbd the search was slow and opening applications took minutes./li liClick on the close button on any application lagged, with at least 3 minutes pause/li liMy mouse cursor moved, the display was frozen and I couldn't do anything./li /ul  strongDebugging Steps/strong  I decided to investigate, after the 3rd time of clean rebooting after shutting down my applications using Firefox instead of chrome, closing all of my start-up applications, I un-installed Flash too.  ul liThe Disk Utility application ran tests on my partition and my disk reporting everything was OK em(I then read this is not a reliable test)/em/li liI rebooted my Mac and using kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⌥/kbd + kbdP/kbd + kbdR/kbd and ran extensive tests on the RAM, it took about 2 hours, everything reported OK and passed (no failures)./li liI attempted to run further memory tests from Apple over the net using kbd⌘/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdD/kbd again, everything passed./li /ul  I thought it's the memory and decided to remove a stick of RAM and test if it failed, it did, I left 1 stick of ram out running on 8gb from 1 crucial stick. The same problems occurred as above.  I therefore assume the problem is my Hard Disk, regardless, I still want to back-up my installation as an image which can be restored from a USB storage device.  strongQuestion/strong  ol liIs it possible to boot-up my Mac from a USB external storage device and  install my existing OS as it is on a new hard disk?/li liI have read it's possible for Disk Utility to clone  my partitions and disks as a code.dmg/code to an external drive - but how does this work with FileVault/encrypted disks?/li /ol  <answer237152> Yes, you can do this with disk utility.  When you try to access the FileVault encrypted disk it will prompt for a password. You can then select it as the source for a restore to another drive.
