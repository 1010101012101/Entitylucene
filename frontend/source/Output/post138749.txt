Remove Eject Icon from Menu bar <body> ï¿¼How do I get rid of this icon?  I'm not even sure what it's for. It's possible that it's for remote CD Drive, but I don't remember how I got it up there in the first place.  Details:  ul liiMac 27 inch late 2012/li liOS X Mavericks/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gMPz3.png" alt=""  <answer138754> The strongEject/strong menu is part of the Menu Extras that are of the standard core service items for the Mac.  It is not normally enabled.  But one way of enabling it is to double click on the  code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Eject.menu/code  file.  The Eject menu is normally for your built in disc drive if you have one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hbsFC.png" alt="enter image description here"  It may or may not work on external disc drive.  To remove the Eject Menu  ul liPress and hold the Apple/Command key./li liClick and drag the Eject menu icon off the menu bar./li liOnce you start dragging the Eject icon, you can release the Apple/Command key./li liRelease the mouse button when the Eject menu no longer appears in the menu bar.  The Eject icon will disappear./li /ul  <comment163718> Awesome! Thank you very very much! <comment163728> It may not have been enabled by default under older versions of OS X, but on my brand new 2013 iMac with Mavericks it was already there when I booted up the first time (I plugged in an external USB BD drive before powering up).
