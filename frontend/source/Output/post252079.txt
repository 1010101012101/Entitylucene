Graphical Artifacts in iMac <body> My 2009 27" iMac i7 has several problems, however, the main one is the visual artifacts. They are large areas of black and grey bars, and text displays erratically. Spacing is also affected - the apple menu and all the toolbars are on top of each other   They don't show in safe mode, and the machine is still responsive (albeit very slowly) in normal mode. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9JMh2.jpg" alt="this" is what the screen looks like.   Trying to open apps causes it to partially open like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXscs.jpg" alt="text edit shouldn&#39;t look like this."  I can't run AHT because I no longer have the original disks - I'm going to try the github copy linked shortly.  I believe the problem is related to my graphics card, since the symptoms are similar to those affected by faulty graphics cards in the 2011 model.  However, that doesn't explain why the issues would vanish in safe mode.
