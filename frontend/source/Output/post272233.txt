Airport extreme guest network and port forwarding <body> I have airport extreme and I am currently using guest mode feature. Recently I bought few ip cameras to use as baby monitor and these are connected to my main network and I managed to do port forwarding to access these cameras from internet. I know this opens big security hole in my network and I have been thinking whether there is an easy way to isolate these cameras. My question is whether I will be able to access these cameras remotely if they are connected to my guest network? In this way, if someone gains access to cameras they will not be able to do much damage as the main network is not accessible. I can try this and see whether it works but it was pain to setup these cameras. So I thought I would ask before I mess up my setup. Thanks in advance.
