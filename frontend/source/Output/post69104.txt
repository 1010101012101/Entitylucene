How can I name a voice memo in iTunes <body> How can I add a name or title to the voice memos that sync from my iPhone to iTunes on my Mac? All I get in the playlist is the date and duration of the memo - right click, left click, nothing works.  <answer69113> You can rename your voice recording using the "Get Info" window, which you can invoke by:  ul liChoosing strongFile  Get Info/strong/li liOr, right-clicking and choosing "Get Info"/li liOr, pressing kbd&#8984; I/Kbd/li /ul  From there, click on the "Info" tab, and you can enter something else in the "Name" field:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TBJGu.png" alt="enter image description here"  The same procedure works on all other files in iTunes as well, like music and movies.
