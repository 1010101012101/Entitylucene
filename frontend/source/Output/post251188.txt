How do I upload specific Apple Photos albums to Flickr? <body> The Flickr tool wants to sync my entire Photos library and Apple Photos only want a to share a small number of photos to Flickr at a time.   <comment312459> Click on album - Command+A to select all - Right-click on one of the photos - Share - Flickr. Does that not work? <comment313403> Will this be on an iOS device or a Mac? <comment313474> @tubedogg it limits it to 15 or so at a time <comment313475> Jamie,- Mac computer
