Why does my Twitter account keep reappearing in System Preferences/Internet Accounts? <body> I delete my Twitter account from "Internet Accounts".   Within 10 seconds the Twitter account reappears.   How can I get it to reset?   Companion problem is that my Twitter account shows up multiple times in Notification Center  img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5470131/multipleTwitterAccounts.png" alt="multiple accounts"  What I have tried:  ul liRevoke access in Twitter account/li lirecovery disk/resetpassword (reset ACL)/li lidid a Safe Boot/li lichanged account from standard to administrator/li /ul  <comment159278> Did you try to Revoke access in your Twitter account ? <comment159346> sure did. What I would like to do at this point is remove *all* "Internet Accounts" and re-enter the accounts. Creating a new "user account" on the Mac is not really an option. <comment159364> It could be that you need to restore your users ACL's <comment159537> did that - no change <comment159540> sorry, I was not specific, I meant not the Disk Utility ACL repair, but the user account. <comment159542> did that (recovery disk/resetpassword) - no change - did a Safe Boot and tried - no change - changed account from standard to administrator - no change
