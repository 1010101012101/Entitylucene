Which MacBook doesn't have any fans? <body> I'm looking to buy a MacBook Pro (13"), but I want it to be as quiet as possible. So, which MacBook Pro doesn't have fan? Only the Gen-5 Broadwell CPU?  <answer176393> The recently announced 12 inch sized retina screen MacBook (Early 2015) will be the first fanless MacBook to ship once it goes on sale.   The MacBook Air (11" &amp; 13") and the MacBook Pro 13" have one fan, the MacBook Pro 15" has two.  <answer178457> As Matthieu stated the only model without a fan is a new MacBook 12".  The good news is that newest strongMacBook Pro Retina (13-inch, Early 2015)/strong has only one fan which is on only under have load. I'm playing with this machine from few days (max out with i7 CPU) and strongmost of the time fan is 0 rpm/strong. (in my 15" model they only slowed down, in 13" is completely off)  You will like new Trackpad as well because in the settings you can make it more quite by setting codeClick pressure/code to codeLight/code. So the most loud thing is the keyboard. (but more quite then on the 15" model - less travel keys)  <answer179355> The recently announced MacBook has no fan. All other MacBooks, to my knowledge, have a fan.  <comment208224> thats it, but most of the time you won't hear a thing from those fans <comment208225> In the summer with high CPU usage you will definitely hear them. <comment208226> i already had a summer with it and it was quite for me. If i want to hear the fans, i just need to start Youtube in Chrome, otherwise its silent. <comment208464> Being Apple products, all MacBooks have large numbers of rabid fans. ;) <comment209986> Watch a video and you'll hear.
