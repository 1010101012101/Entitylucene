Applescript Searcher problem <body> The AppleScript code:  precodeon dialogBox(theMessage) display dialog theMessage default answer "" buttons {"Cancel", "Search"} default button 2 with title "Pick a search engine" end dialogBox  dialogBox("Google, YouTube, Wiki, Dictionary, Apple, Adobe, or Google Images")  if text returned of result = "Google" then set search to text returned of dialogBox("Enter Google Search") tell application "Google Chrome"     activate     open location "https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=4fJgVJ6SM8yD8QfJjYGICA&amp;gws_rd=ssl,cr&amp;fg=1#q=" &amp; search end tell  else if text returned of result = "YouTube" then set search to text returned of dialogBox("Enter YouTube Search") tell application "Google Chrome"     activate     open location "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=" &amp; search   end tell   else if text returned of result = "Wiki" then set search to text returned of dialogBox("Enter Word") tell application "Google Chrome"     activate     open location "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" &amp; search   end tell  else if text returned of result = "Dictionary" then set search to text returned of dialogBox("Enter Word") tell application "Google Chrome"     activate     open location "http://Dictionary.Reference.Com/Browse/" &amp; search   end tell  else if text returned of result = "Apple" then set search to text returned of dialogBox("Enter Apple Search") tell application "Google Chrome"     activate     open location "http://www.apple.com/search/?q=" &amp; search   end tell  else if text returned of result = "Adobe" then set search to text returned of dialogBox("Enter Adobe Search") tell application "Google Chrome"     activate     open location "http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/search/index.cfm?term=" &amp; search  end tell  else if text returned of result = "Google Images" then set search to text returned of dialogBox("Enter Image Search") tell application "Google Chrome"     activate     open location "https://www.google.ca/search?site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=890&amp;q=" &amp; search  end tell end if /code/pre  The Problem:  At the top, it says ("Google, YouTube, Wiki, Dictionary, Apple, Adobe, or Google Images")  I want to make it so it puts a question mark at the end, like so: ("Google, YouTube, Wiki, Dictionary, Apple, Adobe, or Google Images?")   The Google Images has a question mark but when I type "Google Images" in the text box, it closes. Can someone help so I can type Google Images with the question mark and the program doesn't close?  <answer155719> Add strong"Google Images?"/strong to the acceptable results for the text returned.  precodeelse if text returned of result is in {"Google Images", "Google Images?"} then /code/pre  instead of:  precodeelse if text returned of result = "Google Images" then /code/pre  This will allow for you to enter both as acceptable answers in your dialog.  <answer155729> I would recommend you change your script to something like this, to avoid all the copy/pasting:  precode-- this makes it much easier to add a new search engine.
