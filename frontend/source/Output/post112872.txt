Is there a way to set/unset the execute bit on a file in osx 10.6.8 without using terminal (or bypassing it)? <body> I would like to do the following:   precodechmod +x filename.txt /code/pre  without using the terminal.  Is there a way to bypass the terminal and invoke a kernel system call ? I'd rather not write a program to do this.  Instead I was wondering if I could somehow simulate a terminal with (perhaps) an application besides terminal to invoke system calls.   I have already tried doing Command Key + i on the file to show the information GUI.  However there is no option for setting the execute bit.   Would appreciate help from os x administrator experts in the community.  <answer112883> You could use an SFTP client (like CyberDuck, Transmit etc) to give you a Finder-like view of your files with a GUI interface for permission control to include the x bit.  With Transmit you don't even need to make a SSH connection, you can just browse locally.  Not sure if any of the free clients offer this feature.  <answer113059> strongKeyboard Maestro/strong can do this using the following macro, which runs codechmod +x/code on each item in the current Finder selection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/14TRd.png" alt="⌃⇧X: For Each Item in the Collection Execute Actions The items in the (fixed) Finder selection; Execute Shell Script; chmod +x &quot;$KMVAR_File&quot;."  supDownload Macro/sup  <answer113061> Path Finder a Finder replacement has a Get Info that allows you to change the execution bit,  <comment132545> Did you try Automator ?
