Garageband 10 Audio Unit gone <body> I am trying to use an AudioUnit plugin that requires a USB security authentication key. The first time I installed the Audio Unit I didn't have the key. When I received my key and authorized the software (Antares Auto Tune with the iLok USB key) the plugin did not show up.   I attempted to remove the cache files to force Garageband 10 to find the plugin but none of it worked.   The strange thing though is I can open Garageband 6 and the plugin shows up and if I create a new account on my computer the plugin shows up but this is suboptimal.   <answer207615> I received a response from Antares with the answer     Once you are in the "Library" folder go to:       Caches/AudioUnitCache/      Delete the â€œcom.apple.audiounits.sandboxed.cache" file.      Go back to the Library folder, then open the Preferences folder      Once you are in the Library/Preferences folder, delete the file   "com.apple.audio.InfoHelper.plist"      Empty your trash and restart your computer.      You should now find Auto-Tune 8.1 in GarageBand.   This solved it for me.   <comment352756> This helped me but I also deleted "com.apple.audio.SandboxHelper.plist" file as well. Not sure if that was needed.
