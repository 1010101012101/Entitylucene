Files on desktop change position when saved. How do you fix this? <body> This has been happening for some time, and now that I am organizing lots of files from various parts of my work and study, it is really driving me crazy.  For example, I have text or spreadsheet files correctly organized in an area of the desktop. If I save one of those files, it goes all the way to the right side of the desktop. I then have to search for the file and drag it back to its initial position, every single time.  My 'Sort By' is set to 'Snap to Grid'.  EDIT: Changed the 'Sort By' to 'None' and the bug still occasionally happens.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  <comment316908> If you turn off "Snap to Grid", what happens? <comment316911> @Allan The bug goes away. But 'Snap to Grid' is sooo useful. Having to right-click and then select 'Clean Up' almost every single time takes so much time. <comment316918> Do you have anything selected in "Clean Up By"? <comment316921> @Allan No. I think you can't select this option. Doing so reorders your whole desktop. I would try it, but it would take almost 5 minutes to reorganize my desktop how I had organized it before. <comment316923> Just to make sure we're on the same page...There is a "Clean Up" and a "Clean Up By" with a sub-menu.  I am asking if you have anything selected in the "Clean Up By" sub menu. <comment316977> @Allan Yes, 'Clean Up By'. I am pretty sure it is the same as 'Sort By' but it is a one-use option. You can't select an option where a checkmark will be next to one of the options (which would be 'Sort By' instead). When you do 'Clean Up By' it reorganizes the files on your desktop to the option you selected. Then if you need to do another 'Clean Up By', you need to select the option you want again. I don't want to try it at the moment because I have a whole bunch of files of which I would then need to reorganize again. <comment316978> @Allan From [Cult of Mac:](http://www.cultofmac.com/108289/learn-the-difference-between-finder-clean-up-by-arrange-by-on-lion-os-x-tips/) "It is called Clean Up By and it is available when a Finder window is active on the Finder View menu. If you select it and then one if its sub-options: Name, Kind, Date Modified, Date Created, Size or Label **your files are temporarily sorted in the selection you made.** [...] **The sort selected using Clean Up By is temporary and if you want to arrange the files permanently you need to use Arrange By** [...]" <comment317196> @Allan I changed the 'Sort By' to 'None' and the bug still occasionally happens for some reason.
