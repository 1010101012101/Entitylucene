Is there a way to tweet from a keyboard command? <body> I use codeCMD space/code a million times a day to find files, launch apps, etc.  Wouldn't it be cool if I could press a keyboard combination and get a box to send a tweet?  I know I can do it through notification center but I'm looking for a method that doesn't require me to leave the keyboard.  <answer58205> The official Twitter app lets you define a shortcut in its settings (Global new tweet): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aKsUv.png" alt="enter image description here"  As far as native Twitter integration goes, I really don't know :)  <answer58344> You can send tweets using the Twitter libraries for Ruby or Python, but it requires signing up at dev.twitter.com.  precode#!/usr/bin/env ruby -KU -rubygems  require 'twitter'  Twitter.configure do |config|   config.consumer_key = ""   config.consumer_secret = ""   config.oauth_token = ""   config.oauth_token_secret = "" end  tweet = `osascript -e 'try tell application (path to frontmost application as text) display dialog "" default answer "" text returned of result end end'`.chomp  exit if tweet.empty? Twitter.update(tweet) /code/pre  AlfredTweet is a Twitter client written as an Alfred extension.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1jnQZ.png" alt=""  <comment66954> That's definitely a step in the right direction.  But unfortunately, I have to have the Twitter app running.  But that's not a huge deal.  Unless someone can come up with a way to do exactly that without the app running, then I will give you the answer shortly. <comment66955> How about using a shortcut to run an AppleScript? <comment66959> You might be able to use the answers to this per question along with [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) to tweet. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57668/what-hooks-exist-into-notification-center-twitter-so-that-i-can-tweet-programm <comment66966> @Moshe in my best Homer Simpson voice:  "Explain how!" <comment66967> Although I am not 100% sure I believe Alfred may be able to tackle this somehow, would probably require the power pack though. <comment66968> The PowerPack can enable the use of shortcuts to run applescripts, but the trouble is having this script in the first place. <comment66972> OMG I just installed alfred.  How could I have NOT known about this??  I will experiment and see if I can get something up.  I am a programmer by trade, after all.  lol <comment85993> Perhaps you can try a widget such as [Twidget](http://gettwidget.com/) ?
