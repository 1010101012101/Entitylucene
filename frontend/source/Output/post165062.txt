What screenshots are actually required for submission? <body> I am confused. The apple guidelines say things like:     If your app indicates that it is optimized for the iPhone 6, at least one 4.7-inch screenshot is required. Up to four additional screenshots can be uploaded. You can rearrange the screenshots when you create or edit the iTunes Connect record.   And     If your app indicates that it is optimized for the iPhone 6 Plus, at   least one 5.5-inch screenshot is required. Up to four additional   screenshots can be uploaded. You can rearrange the screenshots when   you create or edit the iTunes Connect record.   I am about to submit an iPhone game, in my .xcodeproj file I have codeDevices/code set to codeiPhone/code, so it is supposed to run on iPhone, and iPad in compatibility mode.  What does "optimized for" mean? Where do I set what my game is optimized for? Do I need to provide iPhone 6 and 6 Plus screenshots?  What about iPad screenshots? The compatibility mode screenshots don't look great.  <answer165109> When you optimized you app to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus you have to add new image and icon sizes in your assets. If you select codeImages.xcassets/code in your project and then select your AppIcon and hit kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd0/kbd you must see something like that:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VKZ1S.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you have selected iOS 8.0 and Later Sized you will have to provide screenshots for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, in other case, it won't be necessary.  <comment194927> what about iPad sizes? <comment194941> If you run in compatibility mode, you won't be able to update screenshots for it as the app is "only" for iPhone. <comment202766> @jherran what if app does not support native resolution for iPhone 6 and 6 plus and still we provide screen shots for 4.7 and 5.5 inch display in zoom mode. Will there be any issue in such case. <comment202768> @iLearner nop. Just people on 4.7 and 5.5 devices will able to see those zoomed screenshot. <comment241222> i unchecked 8.0, but the when you test the app, the 4 inch views do not get stretched to 5.5 inch
