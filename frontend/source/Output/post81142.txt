What are the requisites for RAM in a MacBook? <body> I've just purchased my MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) em(it's not the retina model where RAM is fixed)/em and I'm considering more RAM. On the system information app, I found this info.  precodeBANK 0/DIMM0: 2GB DDR3 1600 MHz OK BANK 1/DIMM0: 2GB DDR3 1600 MHz OK /code/pre  Will any RAM, DDR3, 1600MHz work or does the MacBbook have some other requirement to be compatible that isn't listed above?  <answer81149> Any 1600 MHz DDR3 SODIMM will work.  You do not need to buy one from OWC or any Mac specialty shop.  <comment93574> Is this a retina or non-retina model? On non-retina, any 1600 MHz DDR3 SODIMM will work. If it's retina, the RAM is soldered to the board and cannot be replaced. <comment93575> My shopping advice for upgrading memory in Macintosh computers is to buy from a place that specializes in Macintosh. I've bought RAM which should have been fine spec-wise, but didn't work. When I ordered from a Macintosh specialist (OWC) RAM with the same specs worked fine. <comment93577> It's non-retina. I've already searched in OWC, but in my country I can't find a store that sales their products. Do you think that this model should work? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233382 <comment93581> I believe there are CAS timing recommendations, but can't find a good "official" link from Apple, but I implicitly trust [RamJet's description of RAM needs](http://ramjet.com/macbook.asp#BlackBezel) for every Mac that's been made. If no one digs up an answer, that might be a good place to check for requirements. <comment93582> @WarrenPena Thanks for the flags and for working to improve the question. <comment93596> Just one more question, I found that the maximum memory that it supports it's 8GB. Now, that would be on each slot (8+8 = 16GB) or 8 total  (4+4 = 8GB)? (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270) <comment93605> One more question, I found that the maximum memory that it supports it's 8GB.
