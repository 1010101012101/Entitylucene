black berry link, can't download from website <body> I need to download black berry link onto my mac book pro running OSX 10.12.3  the black berry is really screwed up and I can't get into settings. I believe it is running OS 10. I think I need to download black berry link. I've tried the black berry website http://ca.blackberry.com/software/desktop/blackberry-link and clicked "download for mac" but it just sends me to an error page.  I am trying to get photos and videos off of it. The black berry won't connect to internet or wifi of any kind. There is no SD card that can be removed so it seems like this is the only way.  Any help at all will be greatly appreciated  <comment345254> Seems like an issue with the Blackberry website! Try contacting Blackberry's support.
