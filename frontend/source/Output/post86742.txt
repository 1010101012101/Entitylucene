Attempting to restore iPhone 4 gives error -1 <body> I just bought a iPhone 4 off Craigslist, and it's stuck on the iTunes screen. Whenever I try to restore it, towards the end of the process, an icon pops up and says error -1. What does this mean?  <answer86836> Unfortunately, according to Apple, codeerror -1/code indicates a hardware issue. Specifically:     This may indicate a hardware issue with your device. Follow Troubleshooting security software issues, and restore your device on a different known-good computer. If the errors persist on another computer, the device may need service.
