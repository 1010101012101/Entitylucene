How to make windows of new folders open in my size? <body> In OS X 10.8.2, I create a new folder by right-clicking in the Finder and selecting emNew Folder/em. When I open this folder, the size of the window is not the size of the foremost window. The window size inherited by the new folder is always the system default window size, and apparently can not be changed by any means.  Is there a preference, possibly through Terminal, to have the windows of newly created folders open in my preferred window size?  <answer72320> I mostly use column view and have removed all folders except the home folder from favorites, so the root folder of most windows is code~/code or code//code. When the default dimensions or view options for them change, I reset them by running this script with FastScripts.  precodetell application "Finder"     if number of windows is 0 then return     tell Finder window 1         set toolbar visible to false         set sidebar width to 0         set statusbar visible to false         set current view to column view         set bounds to {474, 250, 1318, 750}         tell its column view options             set shows icon to false         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  FinderMinder watches what windows you open and changes their dimensions. The windows appear at the previous position for a split second though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKa9m.png" alt=""  <answer80728> I finally came up with a nearly perfect solution based on Lauri Ranta’s script.  ol liI modified the code slightly./li liI did include some additional actions in Automator./li liI called up the AppleScript code in Automator./li liI saved the Automator script as “create new folder”./li /ol  &lt;&lt;&lt; Not enough points to show Image of script   In Service Preferences I activated “create new folder”, and assigned the keystroke kbdCmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdM/kbd.  Keying kbdCmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdM/kbd in the Finder now creates a new folder with the characteristics set up in the AppleScript.  I could assign kbdCmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdN/kbd in Service Preferences to “create new folder”, but it did not replace the OS X default action of Cmd-Shift-N.   I like to hear from anybody who can get kbdCmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdN/kbd to work with “create new folder”.  <comment83908> When you say folder size, you're referring to the size of new Finder windows that show you the contents of a folder, correct? <comment83918> I'm a bit confused too. New folders open to the size of whatever the size of your frontmost window is set to. New finder windows open to the whatever the size of the last closed window was. <comment84047> @Ranta Thank you for the links - I'll look into them for sure (sorry for intruding). Do you know of a app or script that makes every new window open to a size that is just enough to view everything displayed in it? Maybe the width can be left standard.... <comment86407> I'm a bit confused too.

NOT TRUE if you open a new window with New finder windows open to the whatever the size of the last closed window was. <comment93133> Thank you for your answer.
