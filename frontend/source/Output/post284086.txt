Siri saved my reminder on the shared "family" list. How can I prevent this from happening again? <body> I asked Siri to remind me to purchase some personal items at the pharmacy, and right at that time the reminder appeared, I got an awkward phone call from a family member asking me why my reminders appeared on their phone.  I discovered this when I opened "reminders" on the Mac. Somehow the only reminder list I have is "Family". That means every alert I had appeared on their devices.   every.one.  Besides being exposed to a complete lack of privacy, how can I stop default reminders, of any source, from appearing on the family iCloud group?  Examples: Email, calendar, events, etc  <answer284087> strongSettings/strong → strongReminders/strong → strongDefault List/strong. This is where you can choose the list you wish to store reminders when you don't specify a location at the time of creating the reminder.  ul li"Remind me to …" uses the list you select as the Default List in Settings./li li"Add … to my … list" uses the list mentioned in that specific Siri command./li /ul  <comment358236> Mac is defaulted to "All Reminders" ... will see what phone is once it's booted up.
