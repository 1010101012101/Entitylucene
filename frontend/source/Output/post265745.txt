bluetooth keyboard not in keyboard preferences <body> I have a Microsoft Surface Ergonomic keyboard and a 2016 touchbar MBP running macOS 10.12 (Sierra). The keyboard is connected to the MBP (I can type) but it doesn't show up in keyboard preferences (so I can't remap keys).   How can I get the keyboard to show up to show up in keyboard preferences? How can I remap the keys to be:  ul liWindows - Alt/li liAlt - Command/li liCaps lock - Control or Escape./li /ul  I'm aware of karabiner but am frustrated that is keyboard isn't showing up.   <answer266408> It doesn't show up for me either on 10.12.2.  Karabiner Elements is working great for me.  <comment335566> Thanks, that worked for me. So sad that the built in pref panel doesn't work automatically. <comment345476> I landed this page while I'm looking for the issue about the surface ergonomics keyboard with my macbookpro touchbar. I have the same problem with Mystic, but it's acceptable for me. However, the bluetooth connection is often disconnected, more than 10 times a day. Any one has the same issue?
