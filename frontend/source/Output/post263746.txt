Why don't some mp4 files preview in finder? <body> I am having a strange issue with MP4 video files in finder.   I have 2 video files, both MP4, codecs: codeH.264, AAC/code, kind: codeMPEG-4 File/code.  In preview, one of the video files is not able to be previewed, while the other one is. What I mean is, when I press spacebar to preview the video, the first video just has a spinning wheel and never loads, while the second previews perfectly fine.  Why is this?  Video that can't be previewed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6rZ9S.png" alt="first"  Video that can be previewed as seen by the black square:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KItBW.png" alt="second"  <comment330477> If you open them in VLC in turn and go to Window  Media Information. You can then view the codec and bitrates etc. Look for any discrepancies, it may lead you to the problem.
