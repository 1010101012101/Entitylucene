Keyboard Shortcut for switching to Desktops #5 and higher <body> How can we create a keyboard shortcut to switch to desktops #5 and higher? Under preferences, seems like #4 is as high as we go  <answer178362> The desktops you want to set in the shortcuts menu should exist when you open te preferences. When you add one with the settings screen open, it doesn't refresh the list.   Just open and close the preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VJ0eN.png" alt="keyboard shortcuts"  <comment211294> Did you make the Spaces first?
