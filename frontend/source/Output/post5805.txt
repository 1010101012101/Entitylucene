Hierarchical Smart playlists vs Smart playlists <body> What does the "..." button in the iTunes "Edit Smart Playlist" dialog do? And how is specifying a condition using that any different than a condition specified otherwise (by clicking the "+" button).    The only link I could find on that is iPod nano: Hierarchical Smart Playlists do not update on device and that doesn't clarify anything.  <answer5806> The "..." allows to nest criteria for smart playlists.  Say you would like a smart playlist that contains all tracks from Bob Dylan or the Beatles with a score of 3 stars or better.  Without hierarchical rules you only have the options of getting the tracks that match strongall/strong or strongany/strong of your rules.  With hiearchical rules you can have the condition strongall/strong on one level and strongany/strong on another level.  It seems that nested rules exist since iTunes 9; see also a screenshot.  Here is my example:  hr  Match strongall/strong rules  ul liRating is greater than 3 stars/li listrongany/strong of the following  ul liArtist contains Bob Dylan/li liArtist contains Beatles/li /ul/li /ul  <comment6080> Thats just great! I wanted to get back some hard disk space and tried Merlin Mann's tricks (http://www.43folders.com/2006/11/10/smart-playlists-for-packrats) but wanted a greater flexibility in doing it. Hierarchical rules provided just that.
