What happens if I don't eject before disconnecting my iPod? <body> iTunes is always sure to tell me that I have to eject my iPod before I can physically disconnect it from the computer.  What is going on when you eject it? What is the software doing? What's the risk of disconnecting it without ejecting it first?  <answer133337> If the connected devices are exchanging data while you interrupt it (unplug) following can happen.  You can have a corrupt files/folders on either site.  Mostly that can be repaired but not always.  If you use Eject, the data transfer process is stopped correctly.
