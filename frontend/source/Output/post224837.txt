Mac App Store stuck on Sign In <body> I recently installed a fresh (erased my HD) install of OS X El Capitan 10.11.3  During my first log in I skipped sign in to my apple id  Now when I open my Mac App Store and try to Sign In, it gets stuck after I press Sign In button  I am using proxy authentication from my university  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IpPa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer224881> Problem solved, after a restart!  <comment272701> Let me suppose that you have entered your Apple ID and just erased it on screenshot for the security reasons, right? :) Next, I would suggest to wait some time. This happens and it might take about +/- 5 minutes to wait. After that first long one, you'll be able to login normally, i.e. not waiting this long. <comment272743> Yeah, I erased my userid from screenshot. I had to force restart (pressing power button) since app store was not quitting. I also tried logging to iCloud account from System Preference which has same id as in app store.
