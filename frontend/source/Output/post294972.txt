Mac Mini 2011 freezes and reboots <body> My Mac Mini (mid 2011) frequently freezes under medium to heavy graphics load (e.g., while using Citrix RDP or playing games). Until today I used to think this was caused by overheating but after a thorough cleaning at the genius bar the overheating is gone for sure but the random freeze remains. Here is a photo of the display when my computer froze.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C3BqA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Any clues as to what may be the issue here?  <answer294974> The image you showed are symptoms of the graphics chip on the logic board failing.   This requires a hardware repair (replacing the logic board) unless you find a place that would do component level repairs.   Given it's a 2011 the Apple Store will still be able to help but the cost of the logic board is (last I recall) usually $157.99 Plus tax plus $79 labor. You get 90 days of warranty on the replacement logic board.   <comment372403> I ran hardware test on my mac and it says "No trouble found". Any way I can confirm this diagnosis? <comment372442> If you can hook up a second display you will most likely reproduce this issue on it. Combine that with booting up to another operating system: if the issue persists it's clearly a hardware issue and you would need the repair I mentioned. The included hardware test on Macs doesn't help all that much, don't depend on it to be absolute.
