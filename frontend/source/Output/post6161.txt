How can I get the load average (and only the load average) on Mac OS X? <body> On all linux boxes code/proc/loadavg/code contains the raw load for 1, 5, and 15 minutes. Nothing extra. On OS X machines this file does not exist.  Is there a file or a terminal command which will give me the 1, 5 and 15 minute load averages under OS X, similar to code/proc/loadavg/code on Linux? I know codetop/code and codew/code display the load averages but they have a lot more information too. I want emjust/em the load averages.  <answer6163> Take the commands you know (top, uptime, w, etc.) and use other tools to reduce to just the data you want.   An example for codew/code:  precodew | head -n1 | cut -d":" -f4 /code/pre  An example for codeuptime/code:  precodeuptime | cut -d":" -f4- | sed s/,//g /code/pre  An example of codeloads.d/code:  precodesudo loads.d | awk '/./ { printf "%.2f %.2f %.2f\n", $7, $8, $9 }' /code/pre  <answer79382> You can also use this sysctl:  precodesysctl -n vm.loadavg /code/pre  <comment6434> Perfect.

Consider something like iStat menus for monitoring load average and other vitals monitoring (warning: this is a commercial app, and no I don't work for the developer).  It integrates some really nice graphical displays in the menubar for OSX: http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/ . <comment6447> Thanks @whaley, but I wanted this for the statusbar of [GNU screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), for when I SSH into my mac. <comment92082> That's *perfect*. I'm using mankoff's answer, and will continue to, but this answer is the closest to what I was asking. Thanks!
