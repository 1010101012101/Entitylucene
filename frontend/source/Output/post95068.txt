Converting a float to hours:minutes in Numbers <body> Probably this is a very easy thing to do, but as handicapped as I am using Apple's iWork applications, I just can't find it.  I have made a calculation in Numbers which results for example in 14,25 or 16,5. All I want to do is to have this output formatted in hours like 14:15 or 16:30.  I just can't find where to do it. I've tried to change the valuetype to 'duration' ('Duur' in Dutch). But that doesn't help. When I try to use =HOUR(value) it's not giving the correct output and it says the value is not a valid date.  <answer145424> I was trying to do the same thing to represent X seconds in a time format.  code=CONCATENATE(A0,"s")+"0s"/code which codeA0/code is seconds   <comment111476> Hmm - I've never had a problem by just adding units to the input times. Rather than forcing a float into a duration, have you tried adding units to the input cells? It's hard to guess what you're doing without seeing the spreadsheet to know if this would work though. <comment111547> I see. I think its because of the calculation. Somehow still strange because its a bunch of numbers divided or and multiplied by eachother which result in a float. When I format a non-formula cell with 'duration' 4,5 becomes 4h 30m. <comment111556> Seems like I have enough to try an answer.
