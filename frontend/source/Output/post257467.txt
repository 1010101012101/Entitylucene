Solution for too many calendars on iCal <body> I manage several different calendars: 1) team-1 at the office, 2) team-2 at the office, 3) family, 4) personal, 5) another one.  Many events, for example, vacations, go to all five calendars. This means that tons of events are 5x in the same slot in my calendar and that clutters things up and makes the thing hard to read. Plus, it makes the calendar event in my Apple Watch basically useless.  Is there any solution for this?   It may seem crazy, but Google Plus had a nice way of sharing links where you could select what "circles" could see whatever you posted. Would be great if there was something similar for calendars.  Looking in the Apple Store, there's just too many calendar apps out there. Maybe you pros and power users have a suggestion?
