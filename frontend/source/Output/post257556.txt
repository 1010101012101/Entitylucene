Specific external monitor does not work when lid is closed <body> Currently I have a small TV which I use as a monitor. However this monitor/TV is a bit troublesome. I have to choose a specific resolution for it to display on screen as well as it being on the 60hz refresh rate. Once I choose the correct resolution and refresh rate it all works fine till I close the lid. A second after closing the macbook screen the monitor/TV returns "NO SIGNAL". When I open the lid back up it works normally again.  I can confirm that the macbook does not sleep when the lid is closed as I have connected a external mouse and keyboard as well as plugging in the AC power cord. Also when pressing a random key on the external keyboard it makes a sound which means its not sleeping.  It is currently connected to the external monitor via the apple thunderbolt vga adapter using a vga cable.  I have tried resetting the SMC and PRAM and does not seem to make a difference.  I have also checked the console for any errors and this specific one stood out: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sfmaz.png" alt="enter image description here"  I would like some help regarding this issue. Thanks
