where is keychains of my lost user account <body> I lost my user in Mountain Lion and I forced to create a new user account. I access to my previous user's folders now. How can I find my previous keychains? I need to recover them and add into my new keychains.  Regards  <answer101679> The login keychain is in code/Users/username/Library/Keychains/login.keychain/code. If the Library folder is hidden, you can select it with shift-command-G.  You can import the keychain to the current account by just opening it.  <comment119769> keyhains are locked with the previous user password!
