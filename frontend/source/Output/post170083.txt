Mechanism to sync mail accounts between Mac and iPhone <body> Is there a way for me to create an account using my Mac's Mail app and have the account sync over to my iPhone or vice versa? I have iCloud setup on both my Mac and iPhone, but I don't see the accounts added on one device syncing over to the other.   <answer170087> You can use IMAP/POP3br br On Mac you can add IMAP/POP3 account from codeSystem Preferences &gt; Internet Accounts/code  ol liOpen Internet Accounts/li liClick plus icon on left bottom corner/li liIf it's iCloud mail, Gmail or Microsoft Exchange account click the option respectively, otherwise select "Add Other Account..." from the bottom of the list/li liFollow trough the guided account setup, and in the end of setting it up (if it asks) check the Email syncing option./li liYou can get the mail server info from your email provider, but most of them use codemail.provider.tld/code (eg. mail.google.com / mail.ipage.com) domain for the mail server brbr On iDevice (iPhone in this case) open Settings  Contacts, Calendar &amp; Email  Add new account and follow the instructions inserting the same credentials as you gave when adding account to Mac. This way the mail application will fetch the email from the server on both devices, and sync it.brbrHope this helps!/li /ol  <answer220259> No.  (if what you want is a way to configure an account once on a device and have the configuration automagically transferred to other devices.)  <answer228175> Yes you can. This is what the iCloud Keychain is for. Activating it will sync over all of your accounts (those listed in the Mac Accounts settings). One problem is that it is an all or none setting.   <comment250931> I think the question is not asking about syncing the actual emails with IMAP, but syncing the account SETUP, so it doesn't have to be entered all over again. This does not seem possible. <comment297401> Correct and seems quite dull to me. As usual if use icloud all syncs up pretty well. If you try and use something different, no luck. Why would you want to use something different than icloud? They'll probably come up with some corporate bs about security or stuff. <comment312741> When using IMAP mail accounts you have to do nothing: this is already a "sync" method. Only POP is not synced. See other answer. Lex <comment312742> Jozef and Ã–ssi have got the question right. I have tried in vain to find the answer for a while as I find it very amateur to have to enter again all email account settings whenever you have to configure a new IOS device.
