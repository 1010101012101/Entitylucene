Can the Early 2016 MacBook (not Pro) Drive Two Thunderbolt Displays? <body> This question is NOT about how to connect two Thunderbolt displays â€” there are plenty of questions asked here about that, but whether or not the graphics chip in the Early 2016 MacBook 1.3 GHz Core m7 (M7-6Y75) has the power to drive two external displays (Apple Thunderbolt Display) at 2560 x 1440 resolution?  Here's the backstory. I have a MacBook Pro connected to two Thunderbolt displays. I am considering replacing it, but I love my dual Thunderbolt displays. I would like to replace it with the newest 2016 MacBook, but concerned it won't have enough power to drive the two displays.  <answer261463> I should have looked closer to the tech specs on the Apple website:     Dual display and video mirroring: simultaneously supports full native   resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels at   30Hz on an external display, both at millions of colors.   Based on this I can only run my built-in display and one external display, and only at 30Hz.   <answer261465> What those specs are saying is that this model can simultaneously support the stronginternal display as well as up to 3840x2160 at 30 Hz on an external display/strong, both at "millions of colours."  In other words, connecting two external Thunderbolt Displays is strongnot officially supported by Apple/strong. The two displays are the internal display and an external display.  <comment327391> There is a hack to run it at 60Hz.
