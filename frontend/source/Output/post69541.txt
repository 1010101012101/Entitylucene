Mountain Lion booting very slow in Macbook Pro <body> Hi I am using a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010), i5 processor and 4 GB RAM.  I recently updated to Mountain Lion and now it takes more than 2 minutes to boot up.  Is this normal for the MacBook Pro with this specification?  I have checked, there is no login items, and I have also run the checks against the hard disk in Disk Utility and found nothing that might be the cause.  <comment80794> How long did it take to boot up before, and version of OSX were you using before? <comment80795> i was using OS X Lion before and it takes less than a minut <comment80796> That is not normal. I got a MBP 13-inch cheapest model from 09 and it boots much faster than two minutes. You can check what programs are starting by going into your account settings and reading on "Login items". What is shown there? <comment80804> nothing on "Lodin items". That list is empty... <comment83491> I fixed it somewhat using "Driver Genius 3", but i m not satisfied....
