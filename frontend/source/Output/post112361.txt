How to add the Time Capsule to an existing network, in Ethernet? <body> I have just received my new Time Capsule.  I don’t want to create a new AirPort network, I already have one.  I want to connect the Time Capsule to my existing network, in Ethernet. I plan to plug the Time Capsule to my wi-fi access point &amp; router (Freebox), with a (gigabit) Ethernet cable.  ul liWhich Ethernet port of the Time Capsule do I use ? LAN or WAN ? I prefer to use the LAN port, I don’t want my Time Capsule to have anything to do with my Internet connection./li liHow do I configure the Time Capsule ?/li /ul  The guy from Apple’s tech support happened to be a joke.  <answer118231> I'm a bit late, but I just solved this issue on my own home network.  I added the Time Capsule as a normal client on the LAN. Plug it into the LAN port, and it'll be fine. Then you just have to turn off the network creation settings — and you're golden!  Wish I'd found this sooner.
