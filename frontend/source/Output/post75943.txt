What is software dolby-decoding DAC solution on mac-mini? <body> My HDTV hasn't stereo audio out, but has Optical out only. So I connected its audio out to my mac mini and play thru on stereo out using rogue aomeba linein. ( http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/ )  But optical signal is only Dolby Digital, not PCM. So I can hear just noise.  What is the solution replacing RA linein? In other words, software dolby digital DAC to stereo.
