iPhone EXIF/GPS Timestamp - Appears to be based on local settings? <body> I was under the impression that the iPhone received timestamps along with GPS location data. While I can't say its not true for the internal database, it seems to be for the EXIF data attached to photos taken by the iPhone's camera.  I ran a test by turning strongoff/strong automatic date/time settings, ensuring my correct timezone was set.  I took a photo (codeIMG_1692/code), rolled back the time by two hours and took another (codeIMG_1693/code).  Using Phil Harvey's EXIF Editor, I retrieved this output:  precode$ exiftool IMG_1692.JPG | grep Time File Modification Date/Time     : 2012:04:29 22:51:46+10:00 Exposure Time                   : 1/15 Date/Time Original              : 2012:04:29 22:51:46 GPS Time Stamp                  : 13:51:00 $ exiftool IMG_1693.JPG | grep Time File Modification Date/Time     : 2012:04:29 20:51:32+10:00 Exposure Time                   : 1/15 Date/Time Original              : 2012:04:29 20:51:32 GPS Time Stamp                  : 11:40:50 /code/pre  You can clearly see the two hour difference in the file timestamp, as well as the GPS time!  Am I correct in this assertion that the GPS timestamp doesn't come from the GPS at all? Or am I missing something?  <answer50003>    Am I correct in this assertion that the GPS timestamp doesn't come   from the GPS at all? Or am I missing something?   Your experiment definitely makes it look like that!  This very detailed web page Exif Schema for Exif-specific Properties says:     strongGPS Time Stamp/strong: GPS tag 29 (date), 0x1D, and, and GPS tag 7 (time), 0x07. strongTime stamp of GPS data, in Coordinated Universal   Time/strong. Note: The GPSDateStamp tag is new in EXIF 2.2. The GPS   timestamp in EXIF 2.1 does not include a date. If not present, the   date component for the XMP should be taken from exif:DateTimeOriginal,   or if that is also lacking from exif:DateTimeDigitized. If no date is   available, do not write exif:GPSTimeStamp to XMP.   It looks like what's happening is the codeFile Modification Date/Time/code shows the local date &amp; time according the phone's clock, in the phone's time zone.  This is then converted to Coordinated Universal Time ("UTC"), and saved as the codeGPS Time Stamp/code.  <comment57315> Ah yes, forgot to mention the UTC conversion! It would be ideal if iOS wrote both GPS Date and Time from the satellites.. <comment63530> Yes, and it would be great if developers had access to the GPS time... lot's of great things you can do with that! <comment138642> Warning: Don't use the File Modification Date/Time for anything, since it is volatile. For example, you might export the photo and resave it in some way, thus changing the File Modification Date/Time. Use only persistent info such as Date/Time Original to learn when the photo was actually taken.
