Full screen enabled ipad to windows streaming VNC <body> I'm streaming my windows desktop with Splashtop Streamer to my iPad.  However it doesn't support full screen windows apps. Are there any apps which does support full screen windows apps?  <answer100070> Have you tried RDP? There are several Remote Desktop apps, eg PocketCloud that can connect to a Windows PC using the native RDP server.  <answer100077> Jump Desktop seems to be one of the best iOS clients for streaming in my experience. I prefer Screens for a multitude of reasons when I am doing system administration tasks, but for end users working for hours at a time on Windows via the iPad, Jump seems to be the winner in terms of features, shortcuts and usability.
