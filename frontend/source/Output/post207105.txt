If Chrome uses the same engine as Safari on iOS - will the adblockers work there too? <body> iOS9 enabled add-blocking APIs - and there has been a slew of app-blocking applications released. This all appear to target Safari.   My understanding was that Chrome (on iOS) used the same engine as Safari when rendering pages.   My question is: strongIf Chrome uses the same engine as Safari on iOS - will the adblockers work there too?/strong  strongAssumptions/strong  ul lion iOS, Chrome is using iOS WebKit not the Chrome WebKit./li /ul  <answer207115> Same rendering engine under the hood (webkit), but different wrappers.br Chrome uses strongUIWebView/strong which does strongnot/strong include Content Blockers API.  Due to performance, content blockers only work on new apple devices (hardware), and strongnot/strong on UIWebView nor WKWebView.  <comment249747> Could you clarify? My point was that <comment249748> ...on iOS, Chrome is using iOS WebKit not the Chrome WebKit. <comment249753> On which information is the assumption based? <comment250035> You're partially right.   Chrome on iOS uses the same webkit rendering engine,  as opposed to blink engine on the other platforms.    BUT - chrome uses  WKWebview,  which doesn't include the "content blocker" feature that Safari has. <comment250039> @hawkeye I've updated the answer accordingly <comment260557> Chrome on iOS still uses UIWebView https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=423444 <comment260698> @Pier This doesn't invalidate this answer to the original question.. Please re-read the last paragraph of my original answer:  ".... and not on UIWebView or WKWebView" <comment260938> You are stating that Chrome uses WKWebView which is incorrect. <comment261000> @Pier Thanks for the link.  I've updated the answer accordingly. <comment283088> @Pier It's now correct that Chrome uses WKWebView rather than UIWebView, and has been since Chrome 48 was released in the App Store at the end of January 2016.
