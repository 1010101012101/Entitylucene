How to install Ubuntu on Lion? <body> I have downloaded Lion and I want to install Ubuntu as VM.  I found this one:  http://www.tuaw.com/2009/09/07/how-to-set-up-ubuntu-linux-on-a-mac-its-easy-and-free/  Is there any updated tutorial for it?  <comment66140> I think there is no change in the process. You can follow tuaw tutorial to do it. <comment66141> Exactly. If (when?) Virtual Box is Mountain Lion ready, then the tutorial will be exactly the same. <comment66143> FWIW, I have no problems running VirtualBox on Mountain Lion.
