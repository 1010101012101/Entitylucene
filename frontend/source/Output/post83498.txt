How do I format an encrypted Integral Secure Key? <body> I just bought an Integral Secure Key from the Apple store but am fed up with having to use its own software just to transfer files to it as it does not appear as a normal USB drive in Finder.  How can I re-format the drive so as to remove the encryption and just have a normal USB drive? Is it as simple as using disk utility?  Also how could I in the future use the encryption facilities again? Is it enough just to keep the software which is provided on the USB key?  <answer152072> i have the same Integral Secure Key and i can transfer all data without any kind of encryption and store it; for all more private data i use the encryption function. so there is no need to re-format the usb to store data 'more easily"
