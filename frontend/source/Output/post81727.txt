How do I enable the visual menu when changing language inputs? <body> I saw this enabled on my friends Lion MBA, but I couldn't find a way to enable it on my Mountian Lion MBP. Anyone have any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w2qsU.png" alt="When changing languages"  <answer81899> There's probably something I'm missing, but it seems to be shown only for the shortcut for selecting the previous input source (⌘␣ by default). If the shortcut is an F-key, it is only shown if you hold the key and only for a split second.  <comment94426> Are you able to switch keyboards via apple/command plus space?  If not, you may need to deactivate that shortcut in system preferences/spotlight.  Once the shortcut can be used for changing keyboards, the list normally appears if you hold space key for a bit. <comment94837> I changed the hotkey to option + shift + space. I have the same setup on both computers. <comment94887> I thought the visual menu would only work when you use the apple/command plus space hotkey.  But if it works on the other computer with option/shift/space, I don't know why it would not work on this one.
