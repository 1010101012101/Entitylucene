How do I use the MacPorts version of nano as my default text editor? <body> I tried installing nano using "port install nano", but using the "nano" command doesn't open the macports version.   precode$ which nano /opt/local/bin/nano  $ /opt/local/bin/nano --version GNU nano version 2.2.6 (compiled 13:17:29, Nov 26 2013) (C) 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Even if I rename code/usr/bin/nano/code, it complains that code/usr/bin/nano/code doesn't exist, instead of using the macport version.  <answer132420> You can either rename or completely remove /usr/bin/nano, then:  precodeln -s /opt/local/bin/nano /usr/bin/nano /code/pre  The above command creates a symbolic link from /usr/bin/nano to /opt/local/bin/nano  <comment157103> A symbolic link! Of course! Why didn't I think of that :). Thanks for your help! <comment167497> Please don't modify `/usr/bin`. That's Apple-land, and other stuff must be able to rely on the versions of software installed there. In your case, typing `hash -r` into your shell or opening a new one would probably have made MacPorts' nano the default (the old one was used because of a cache in your shell). The symlink isn't necessary.
