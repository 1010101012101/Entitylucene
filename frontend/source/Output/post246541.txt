Where does App Store download files to? <body> I just re-downloaded El Capitán off of the App Store for the purposes of transferring it to another machine via USB.  When it was done downloading, it automatically launched the installer asking me to click on continue to start installing El Capitán.  I do not wish to reinstall, so I quit the installer, but now I cannot find it.  Where would the App Store have downloaded it to?  <answer246544> When finished, it puts them in the Applications folder.  OS installers are all called "Install OS X [OS Name]" which might not be what you expected, if you're looking alphabetically for instance for El Capitan.  Prior to completion they are squirrelled away deep inside code/private/var/folders/code &amp; not easy at all to find.  <answer287569> For me it was: code/private/var/folders/yy/v7l5q9l962j23_n6ttp9cxw00000gn/C/com.apple.appstore/1127487414/iyu1194865269351609080.pkg/code  To find it out for yourself, open "Activity Monitor" - Select the process "storedownloadd" - Open files and Ports - then you should see the path.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rx1U6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment332167> At this folder, search for `appstore` and your file probably will be something like `encrypted0000000000.pkg`.
