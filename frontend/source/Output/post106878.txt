iOS 7 app to create a password protected PDF or DOC file <body> I would like to create a file on my iPad, password protect it, and email it to a colleague.  Is there a way to do this?  It would have to be in a format that is readable by others, like a password protected PDF file or a password protected Word file.  <answer107042> Pages allows creating rich text files which can be password protected from within the app. It supports exporting to PDF and DOC.  <answer120982> PDF Expert 5 will allow you to password protect an existing PDF file (among other things).  PDF Converter from the same company allows you to convert a huge range of different files into a PDF.  <answer163714> molgar is right, just open in Pages app, set password and export as any file format and email it.
