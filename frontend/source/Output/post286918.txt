Move all spaces at once AND be able to split application views <body> I'm surprised that Apple doesn't have this feature which is normal for Linux users. I own two monitors.  I'd like to:  1) Split a Window in half so it takes up half of one of my displays. 2) When switching spaces I'd like all spaces to switch and not just the one in focus.  I normally have a "work" space and a "personal" space. And switching between them saves time.  Is there a way to fix this on macOS Sierra?  <comment362133> I don't know about the split view as I've never used it, but 'all spaces to switch' is System prefs  Mission Control  Displays have separate Spaces - uncheck. <comment362135> @Tetsujin This however breaks the split view from working :( <comment362136> ah, OK, sorry - as I say, I've never seen the need for split view, so never even tried it out.
