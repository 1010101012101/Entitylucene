Low Battery Alert for Mac OS X El Capitan <body> I have Macbook Air, Mac OS X El Capitan.  There is no warning box shown before the battery is near %15, like it did for Mountain Lion. So I can not notice and my computer goes sleep simply when the battery is off.  And even if it did I generally miss it because I use it external monitor attached to my Macbook Air. And because I play Spotify, I may miss the warning sound, too.  Is there warning box for low battery on El Capitan? If not, is there any utility or software that may help for external monitors and even playing music?  <answer238040> h1Default Warning/h1  The battery indicator in the menu bar will turn red when the battery is low. There will also be a critical low power warning when the computer needs to emergency shut down.  See Apple's About Mac notebook batteries page, in particular this section:     h3The low battery warning doesn't display/h3      If you don't receive a warning when your battery has a low charge, generally reported at or under 15%, it may be because the battery menu bar icon is disabled. Follow these steps to enable the battery status menu item:      ol   liOpen System Preferences./li   liClick Energy Saver./li   liEnable the "Show battery status in menu bar" check box to display the battery status menu item./li   /ol      Note: Portables using OS X Mavericks v10.9 or later display the low battery warning when the battery has approximately 10 minutes of power remaining. Earlier versions or OS X instead report it at 15% or less.   h2Third Party: Power Manager/h2  Software such as Power Manager can be used to trigger scripts, sounds, and actions when the battery level drops:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K6o2d.jpg" alt="Power down on battery remaining"  More advanced abilities such as stopping music from playing and integrating the warning into your workflows is possible. Battery levels and changes are exposed through Power Manager's AppleScript interface.  Disclosure: I am an engineer who works on Power Manager. So, feel free to ask technical questions about the product.  <answer238051> There's also a third party app BattMan, which can raise Notifications via Notification Centre and sound an audible alarm when the battery charge drops to certain percentage or time left on battery reaches a certain level (both user settable).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LlpuP.png" alt="BattMan Screenshot"  Full Disclosure: I'm the dev behind this app.   <answer280665> I have Mac OS X Sierra, but the emBattery Monitor/em app I just installed works great and allows you to set a notification threshold at an arbitrary percent for free. Tested it out and it works great.

I have a dodgy battery that cuts off at 33%, so I can't use it.  Lucky I saw the review.
