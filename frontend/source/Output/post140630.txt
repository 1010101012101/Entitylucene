WD HDD physically damaged, what can I use to recover the data on OSX? <body> I have a physically damaged HDD that can still be detected by disk utility, but I cannot access the files inside. I tried using Data Rescue 3 but the UI was very clunky and I always end up having to restart the computer for it to work. It did manage to scan it once and recover many files, but not some specific file types I was looking for. But due to the clunky UI I couldn't scan it again.  Any programs that are reliable and emknown/em to recover files from damaged hard drives ?   Note :   ul liIt is connected externally via USB./li liThe HDD was on a Windows Desktop, but using the mac to read it/li /ul  <comment165722> It's not a duplicate @Mark <comment165723> Why the other question iOS how to get data off a dead disk - which is what you are asking, the answers will be the same <comment165755> @mark This is exactly why I stopped posting here...
