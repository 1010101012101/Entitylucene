Define Route with Gateway and NetIf <body> Hi I'm using some VPN software that isn't the default OSx VPN support.  When it connects it clobbers my routing table, putting all traffic through the VPN.  What I want to do is have something like this route defined (I see this auto defined when I'm not on the VPN) ...  precodeDestination  Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire 192.168.1.2  a0:21:b7:c1:91:64  UHLWI           0        3     en3  /code/pre  Where that Gateway Address is the Mac address of the 192.168.1.2 machine.  When I connect the VPN and new Netif is added "utune0"  So I've tried   precodesudo route add -host 192.168.1.2 -link a0:21:b7:c1:91:64 /code/pre  ... And end up with  precodeDestination  Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire 192.168.1.2  a0:21.b7.c1.91.64  UGHS            0        0   utun0 /code/pre  ... So wrong netif  The I try and add the -interface option   precodesudo route add -host 192.168.1.2 -interface en3  -link a0:21:b7:c1:91:64 /code/pre  ... I End up with   precodeDestination  Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire 192.168.1.2  10:dd:b1:a0:af:43  UHLS            0        0   en3 /code/pre  ... where that gateway address is wrong, it is the mac address of my machines en3 adaptor....   Any ideas how to get the initial route I wanted?  <comment179217> Have you checked your VPN client for routing options? Most offer at least some option on what traffic to route through the VPN connection. <comment179255> Thanks for the comment, Nah there are no options for setting that. looked at that before looking at anything else.
