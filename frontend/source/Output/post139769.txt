How to send all the messages under a contact to an email <body> I need to send all my messages under a contacts name to an email. Is there a way to select all and then send to a given email?  <answer139820> You can only hold one text bubble, then select what text you want and forward it via sms/imessage again, or you can just copy the text and then compose a new email and paste the text in there. :)
