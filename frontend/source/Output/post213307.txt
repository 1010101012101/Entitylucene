Navigate terminal scrollback using keys <body> On most (all?) Linux terminals (eg gnome terminal, tilda, guake etc,..) and the virtual consoles you can browse up through the terminal's scrollback buffer using the keys (ie without the mouse).  Is this possible in OSX's terminal?  eg:  ol liIn Gnome Terminal you enter codels/code/li lioops - 50 lines of output on a 48 line terminal/li liCtrl-Shift-UpArrow scrolls back to see the first few lines of input (and eventually your command invocation/li /ol  On VC's switch UpArrow for codePageUp/code - is there anything equivalent on OSX?  I'm using OS 10.10.5  <answer213309> Yes, Terminal supports the standard OS X Page Up/Down keys for scrolling by pages, and there are Terminal-specific commands for scrolling the terminal view by pages or by lines, and they have keyboard shortcuts that are available even when the terminal keyboard map binds other actions to Page Up/Down. The exact shortcuts depend on the version. See the strongView/strong menu in recent versions, and the strongWindow/strong menu in older versions.  <answer213310> There are shortcuts for Page Up/Down and Line Up/Down in Terminal. You can find them under strongView/strong menu item. For Page Up press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⇞ Page Up/kbd, for Line Up press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⌥ alt/kbd+kbd⇞ Page Up/kbd.  Edit: you can get kbd⇞ Page Up/kbd on Macbook by pressing kbdFn/kbd+kbd↑ Up Arrow/kbd.  <comment257527> Which OS version are You using? <comment257531> Version 10.10.5 <comment257538> Hmm,... turns out half my problem seems to be that Visor prevents the terminal menu from showing,... <comment257540> Thanks - turns out TotalTerminal/Visor was preventing me from seeing the View menu - otherwise I might have found it myself.  For me kbdcmd/kbd+kbdUp Arrow/kbd is needed for Line Up - apparently I didn't find it due to fixation with shift.
