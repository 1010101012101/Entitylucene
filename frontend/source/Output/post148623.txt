How to save contacts on iPhone with broken screen? <body> I dropped my iPhone and broke the screen (is just black). So I bought a new iPhone but I want to sync all my contacts and of course the screen is locked and moved to the side. It looks something like the image below.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6dz47.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  On the lock screen I can only see numbers given below.  precode12 45 78 0 /code/pre  Now I can't unlock my phone to sync to iCloud. How can I save my contacts ?  <answer148636> If you're not already syncing your contacts via iCloud, then you can sync them to your computer in iTunes in the Info screen. Then you can sync the computer's contacts to iCloud and so get them onto your new phone that way.  Alternatively, you could try backing up your current phone (Summary screen) and then restoring the backup to your new phone.   Good luck.
