How to export iOS Maps favorite locations <body> I've done some research already and I'm quite sure that Apple didn't implement such a function. What I want to find out is whether someone else has found any workaround or hacky way to do this.  Basically I have saved a bunch of locations to Maps through Instagram on my phone. Now I'd like to get a list of these locations, preferably with coordinates.
