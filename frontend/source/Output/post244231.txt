How to change default path for photo booth? <body> By default, photo booth save videos in   precode/Users/UserName/Pictures/Photo\ Booth\ Library  /code/pre  Is there a way to change this default path?  I am on OSX 10.11.5  <answer244236> I report here as an answer my comment above.   hr  You can move the codePhoto Booth Library/code to the location you prefer, this procedure should automatically change the path of the emPhoto Booth/em application.   Note that the library is a package that keeps all the photos and the content of the application, if you delete it you will lose all your pics and data.  <comment300938> Have you try by moving the `Booth Library` in another location? <comment300940> No, I haven't tried that....and it works! Thanks! You can make an answer out of your comment. These Apple Applications are pretty weird in how they work. I would have expected an error message when moving this folder. <comment323709> Doesn't work if you try to move it to an external drive though... Still trying to figure out how to do that.
