Troubles connecting Macbook Air 13'' (beginning of 2014) with Apple Cinema Display 2003 under Yosemite <body> I am trying to use an Apple Cinema Display 2003 with my Macbook Air, was working until I upgraded to Yosemite, now Macbook is no longer detecting the display.  I've already done the recommended VRAM and PRAM and SMC resets, nothing helped so far. Any other ideas are appreciated.  <comment226977> Which cables/video interfaces are you using? <comment226997> Hama Adapter Mini-Display Port to DVI
