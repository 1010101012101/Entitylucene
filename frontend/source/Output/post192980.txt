iOS Enterprise App Distribution "White Labeling" <body> We have been making iOS apps and selling them directly to clients who then use their own AppStore to distribute to their internal employees after re-signing the app.  However, I just noticed the following note in the Enterprise Dev Agreement.      Note: This Program is for internal use, custom applications that are   developed by You for Your specific business purposes and only for use   by Your employees and, in limited cases, by certain other parties as   set forth herein. If You want to distribute applications for iOS or   watchOS to third parties or obtain an application from a third party,   then You must use the App Store or B2B Program for distribution.   Does this mean we can no longer continue this practice or is "White Labeling" still allowed?  <comment229837> If you are selling it, then you are competing with Apple. If you are giving it away that is your choice. Tell me which client has they own AppStore? <comment229843> The app comes as part of a complete system. Physical servers and a backend included. I can just say the app is free but you have to buy the rest of the system.. <comment229846> I am not a legal person, but would say that would work.
