How to fix a broken recovery partition (remove it) when repairing it is not possible? <body> My main system is bootable but disk utility says it needs to be repaired.  I can start strongdisk utility/strong from Live-USB which can verify my OS X partition but gives errors on checking the whole disk. The error is "unknown file system" - but it appears only after it found the main file system.   I guess my (hidden) recovery partition might be broken, since I cannot boot into it. Maybe this is the cause for disk utility to bring the error.  I would like to repair the recovery partition or at least delete it. I know there are tutorials of how to create a new one.  <answer271311> I removed my partition with  precode$ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ Blank /dev/disk0s3 /code/pre  which created a blank space.   I then also had to strongrepair/strong the disk in disk utility. Since then everything works fine.  <comment341056> What is the model of mac being used? <comment341060> iMac 2010 mid i7 <comment341122> For future reference, it is possible to use Internet Recovery by pressing Option-Command-R, giving the same result, but without having to create a live USB.
