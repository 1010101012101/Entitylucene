Play stereo as mono <body> Is there a way to get all sound to output as Mono on older Mac operating systems?  With El Capitan, Yosemite, etc, there is a tick box at System Preferences  Universal Access  Hearing, but this doesn't exist on Leopard (I'm running 10.5.8 on an old MacBook).  <comment322099> You might be able to set this up with the Audio-MiDI-Setup application in the Utilities folder. It should be possible with [SoundFlower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) too
