MacBook Pro 2012 appearance <body> I just got the latest MacBook Pro (2.6 GHz i7 Quad Core, 8GB RAM, non-retina).br But the packaging and overall appearance looks just like the older 15" one (I don't see any HDMI and stuff). Are the non-retina 2012 MacBooks supposed to look like this?  Whenever I search for the unboxing/review videos of the newest model, they only review the retina one.  <answer54431> If you want an image of the non-retina 15" 2012 MBP, Apple has one here as a part of this page.  The real answer is simply open your System Information - About this Mac kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdI/kbd window and see that you have a Mid 2012 model.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dS7Ui.png" alt="System Information Pane"  <answer54432> You can have a look at the product pages on apple.com, which among other things, lists all tech specs and even has illustrated pictures of all connections and ports:  http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/13-and-15-inch/  <answer54433> It's easy. The non-retina MacBook Pros didn't get a redesign on the outside. They stayed the same (so, no HDMI "and stuff"). They only got updated on the inside, so your confusion on differentiating them is reasonable.  From Apple's site - here are images of the new 15" non-retina MacBook Pro:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/psSpP.jpg" alt="port side of MBP 15 2012" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hJeq8.jpg" alt="optical/starboard side of MBP 15 2012"  <comment62306> I'm afraid I don't understand what your question is. Are you asking if the computer you received is the one you intended to purchase? Are you asking where to find pictures of the 2012 non-retina display MacBook Pro? What are you looking for here? <comment62308> yup, it says 2.6ghz on the box, but i don't want to unwrap it and test it just in case it's a mistake and i have to return it. Some pictures of the box and the laptop iteslf would be nice <comment62310> The non-retina Macbook Pro has only changed internally, non outside design changes. In fact, there aren't any design changes inside that I'm aware of. It's just a hardware upgrade inside.
