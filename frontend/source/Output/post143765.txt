Lost my contacts on iPhone 4s but they are on iCloud <body> I have an iPhone 4s and my contacts have disappeared... I have 500+ contacts in my iCloud and I am not able to get them on my phone.  I have gone to settings then iCloud and toggled the contacts... nothing is happening...  <comment169356> How do you know the contacts are in iCloud? <comment169358> Try rebooting your phone after enabling contact sync via iCloud.
