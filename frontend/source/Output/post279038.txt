What is Firmware.scap in the /EFI partition? <body> I'm looking at the /EFI partition, and it has 2 .scap file.  code/EFI/APPLE/FIRMWARE/MBP112_0138_B18_LOCKED.scap/code  and  code/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap/code  They both have 2 files with GUID's that are present in the other, however the contents of each are different.  The file with the GUID codeC3E36D09-8294-4B97-A857-D5288FE33E28/code in code/EFI/APPLE/FIRMWARE/MBP112_0138_B18_LOCKED.scap/code contains the text code$IBIOS$  MBP112 88Z 0138 B18 1610201654 Copyright (c) 2005-2016 Apple Inc. All rights reserved./code  However the file with the GUID codeC3E36D09-8294-4B97-A857-D5288FE33E28/code in code/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap/code contains the text codeN $IBIOS$ ROMEXT1 88Z 0002 B00 0710231738/code  What is the Firmware.scap file, and how come when I delete it, nothing changes except that it boots faster?  <answer287371> I suspect the second file is a security update. The 1st one most certainly is a no-fly zone. Has to do with firmware I think.  However, never ever mess with your (U)EFI partition, or you may have a very expensive Apple doorstop on your hands...  Well, my own EFI partition is mounted here. You can mess around with it all you like on an external bootable USB stick.  I'm doing this just to see if I'm able to run an unallowed version of OSX on a very old, already scrapped Mac Mini.  OS bootloader seems to depend on (U)EFI, namely... Revive a broken bootloader/ EFI partition, and you may do wonders. I think.  Just look at this: http://xpcboot.weebly.com  Have fun, but don't break a working Mac...  <comment362960> Yeah, I've referred to bricking it attempting the fix as being the largest investment I'll have ever made in a door stop too. Verbatim. I'm finally heading back to US where I can just go to the apple store and (cringe) let somebody else fix it. Been talking the hackintosh crowd, they seem to think unibeast and clover may be my best bet. While I'm not risk averse by a stretch, the stakes are *just* too high for me. Thanks for weighing. I know now that this isn't the forum for this (type? depth?) of question.
