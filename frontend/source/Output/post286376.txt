How to make Automator insert "AW" into a Stickies Note <body> I tried using "Watch Me Do" in Automator to insert text "AW" and "Return" in a Stickies note. It recorded the following (Events were "Type 'AW'" and "Press Return", the rest is the expansion into code):  hr  -- Type 'AW'  precode    delay 0.315949     set timeoutSeconds to 2.000000     set uiScript to "keystroke \"AW\""     my doWithTimeout( uiScript, timeoutSeconds ) /code/pre  -- Press Return  precode    delay 2.538645     set timeoutSeconds to 2.000000     set uiScript to "keystroke \"     \" "     my doWithTimeout( uiScript, timeoutSeconds )      on doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)         set endDate to (current date) + timeoutSeconds         repeat             try                 run script "tell application \"System Events\"     " &amp; uiScript &amp; "     end tell"                 exit repeat             on error errorMessage                 if ((current date) &gt; endDate) then                     error "Can not " &amp; uiScript                 end if             end try         end repeat     end doWithTimeout /code/pre  hr  In System Preferences, Security &amp; Privacy, Privacy I allowed Automator.app and Stickies.app to control my computer.  I saved the above example as a service and tried executing the service in an empty Stickies note.  Nothing happened.  I'm new at trying to use Automator.  This is such a simple action that I believe that I have misunderstood something.  If I add to the workflow an existing Automator action that launches the Stickies application, then "AW" does get inserted, followed by "Return".  Question How to create a simple keyboard macro with Automator? shows a much simpler Applescript that could be adapted to doing what I describe (I've done such) but I'm frustrated that my simple "Watch Me Do" doesn't work.  What am I overlooking or not understanding?  <answer286693> The strongStickies/strong app is not emscriptable/em, meaning it does not directly support strongAppleScript/strong via a strongStickies AppleScript Dictionary/strong, so most coding is going to use strongSystem Events/strong and what's generally referred to as strongUI Scripting/strong to manipulate the strongStickies/strong app.  The example emcode/em below, will do the following:  ul liemOpen/em Stickies.app and, or if already open, bring it to the front./li liemCreate/em a new Stickies note./li liemMove/em the new note to the top left corner of the screen and set its size to the default size./li liemType/em "AW" and "return", with "return" simulating the Enter key being pressed./li /ul  hr  precodetell application "Stickies"     activate     delay 1 end tell tell application "System Events"     keystroke "n" using command down     set properties of window 1 of application process "Stickies" to {position:{0, 23}, size:{300, 200}}     keystroke "AW" &amp; return end tell /code/pre  This strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em can be placed in a strongRun AppleScript/strong emaction/em in an strongAutomator Service/strong emworkflow/em.  hr  strongNote:/strong One of the drawbacks of strongUI Scripting/strong, is at times the needed use of the codedelay/code emcommand/em to ensure the emtargeted/em strongUI Element/strong is available to be acted upon. You may/will need to either adjust the emvalue/em of any codedelay/code emcommand/em and or add/remove additional codedelay/code emcommands/em as needed/wanted through any given strongUI Scripting/strong scenario. The example emcode/em above, as is, worked on my system. If need be, make use of the codedelay/code emcommand/em and adjust its emvalue/em as/where needed/wanted.  Also the above example emcode/em does not employ any form of absolute emerror handling/em and is meant only to show how the individual emevents/em can be coded to achieve the objective. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate emerror handling/em as needed/wanted.   <comment361905> I accidentally edited this answer while copying, in edit mode, some of its content to another answer I was working on. I then pasted some code for the other answer into this one, however I've rolled it back to a proper answer. Sorry if this caused any confusion.
