How do I get my dual boot to behave correctly? <body> Once upon a time my Mac had only OS X on it, but at various points in history it contained different versions of OS X and several different Linux distributions and their boot menus.  I also had rEFIt or rEFInd installed at some point.  After the most recent Linux installation, my Mac showed rEFInd at boot and let me select OS X, Elementary and the recovery partition.  However, the current situation is that rEFInd never shows, and it picks one of the two semi-randomly. Which one appears to depend which on ran last and if I installed updates or not.  In case where it would pick Elementary, I can get in to OS X by holding option, which only shows OS X and the recovery partition.  How do I get this back to a stable situation where OS X is started by default, but Elementary is still available?
