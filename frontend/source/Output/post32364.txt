Mass email solution that support different email content <body> I'm using Mac, and I group customer into groups in address book and send email to all in the group.  Are there application where I can send the email individually to each one in the group and, by automatically recognizing the stored name, change the first line to addressing to that person?  <comment37077> FYI: The feature you're describing is called "mail merge" <comment37101> You may be better of using a bulk email service such as Mail Chimp.
