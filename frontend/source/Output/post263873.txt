My Spotlight opens the Applications folder instead of opening the application <body> My Spotlight, when I have selected an application, opens the "Applications" folder containing the application, instead of opening the application. I suspect I have a setting somewhere that is set in a weird way. Does anyone know how I can fix this?  <comment330717> Are you holding CMD or OPT when that happens?
