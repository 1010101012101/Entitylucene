Default resizing Split View to not blur one window <body> In OS X El Capitan, Apple introduced a feature called "Split View" that allows you to put two fullscreen apps side by side. Normally when you click and drag the middle dividing line one of the two apps will blur. If you hold kbdOption/kbd while moving the divider neither window will blur.  How can I make this the default behavior, so I don't have to hold kbdOption/kbd when resizing?
