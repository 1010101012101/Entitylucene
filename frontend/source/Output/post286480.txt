MacBook wont boot after creating two small partitions <body> I recently created 2 small partitions, and after that, I shutdown my Mac. Then when I turned Mac back on today it took awhile to boot and then showed a blocked symbol.   I tried booting into the recovery partition. Then I deleted the partition, which is 10 GB in size, but I'm not able to delete the second partition, which is 15 GB. Also, when I tried creating the partitions before, it showed "Operation failed".   After some time, two partitions showed up, both named -- and greyed out. Macintosh HD no longer shows up in Disk Utility. Only some weird disk image shows up as OS X Base System.   I tried to reinstall macOS Sierra but the Macintosh HD partition again does not show up. I tried First Aid but it shows Macintosh is corrupted and needs to be recovered in Recovery, but I booted in the recovery partition only.   So how do I make my mac boot up normally and delete the 15GB partition without losing any data and erasing my HD.  macOS Sierra 10.12.5  And is this problem a serious issue or not?

What command or utility did you use? <comment361441> I used disk utility
