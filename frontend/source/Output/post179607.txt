If I have a number registered with another Apple ID, but create a new Apple ID with that number, what will happen? <body> I want to create a new Apple ID, but the number I want to use is associated with another ID. What will happen if I register this number with a new ID?  <comment213013> what number? the phone number ? <comment213024> if you mean phone number, that and your apple ID are not actually associated with each other.  Your phone has a number, your phone also logs into an apple id.
