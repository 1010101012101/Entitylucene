Automatic conversion between .ps to .pdf upon download onto Mac OSX? <body> Is there any way to convert code.ps/code to code.pdf/code every time automatically as a code.ps/code is downloaded onto a Mac machine? (Using Mountain Lion 10.8)  ul lican Automator perform this task?/li liconvert and then delete the code.ps/code/li /ul  It's annoying that it has to convert from code.ps/code to code.pdf/code in preview every time I open the file, and quick preview doesn't work on code.ps/code.  <answer163675> You could use the Folder Action for that.  Right click on to your download folder  select Folder Action Set up:  Choose Covert PostScript to pdf action.  done  If you feel like modifying the script go ahead.  <answer163704> You could set up Acrobat Distiller with a watched folder, or use Automator with it. This gives you better control over the conversion options, as you could specify the .joboptions.
