Is there any way to compress pictures inside Photos.app <body> It's like PhotoBulk, however I could compress photos inside Photos.app  Because Photos Library takes me more than 30G, and I've noticed that many photos are not compressed.  As an example, I randomly pick up a photo which is 438KB. After compression using PhotoBulk, it's 120KB with "max" compression rate.  <comment373932> I'd suspect most photos in Photos.app are JPEG images and as such are already compressed. <comment373939> This looks like an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info), so can you describe in more details which problem you are trying to solve here (without already making assumptions about the solution)? <comment373941> @patrix I've updated the description :)
