In Xcode, how can I utilize new UI APIs for Yosemite, but then revert to older ones for older OS'? <body> I have been looking all over the place and can't seem to find an answer. (I'm probably not using the correct terminology)   I'm building a simple AppleScript ObjC program and I want to use the new UI API for Yosemite (NSVisualEffectView) but, as expected, it crashes when I open it on Mavericks. How could I get it to use old APIs instead without having to create a completely different app?  <answer151952> You'll need to figure out at runtime if method/class is available. Here's Apple guide about "SDK Based Development".  In Your case It'll look like this:  precodeif ([NSVisualEffectView class]) {     // OS X 10.10 code here. } else {     // OS X &lt; 10.10 code here. } /code/pre  <comment179648> My apologies if these questions are extremely basic. In this block, would I be entering the raw code for the windows themselves (instead of using IB), or could I have a call at runtime look for either the vibrancy.xib or nonVibrancy.xib? <comment179728> @ElRojito You can enter raw code here, or override `initWithNibName:bundle:` method and swap xibs using this `if` statement.
