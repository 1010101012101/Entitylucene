Setting up command line email for Mac Yosemite <body> I am trying to setup my system to be able to send emails from command line.  This link explains the steps, and I am able to send emails.  However, I have one issue, the sender name is picking up the system name. How to add a name to the sender? For your example, if I want to specify a name for 'yourusername@gmail.com'. I tried doing 'My Name ', but that didn't work. Any clue on how to make it work?  <comment247148> You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately.
