Cannot delete partition (minus greyed out) - non-encrypted, no core storage <body> When trying to install Windows 10 from scratch on my Late 2013 MacBook Pro, I was unable to remove the old BOOTCAMP partition through the Boot Camp Assistant.  I erased the partition with Disk Utility, but was unable to join it with my main partition.  Now when I run Boot Camp Assistant, I get the following message: "The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition."  Running codediskutil core storage list/code returns: codeNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found/code  Additionally, FileVault is turned off.  I can add new partitions to the drive manually and delete them, but every time I try to resize the main partition it adds a new Untitled partition that is not deleteable (minus button is greyed out).  Any ideas?  precode$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  244140624      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   244550264    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   245819800       1640            245821440   10921976      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   256743416     262144            257005560   10920264      5  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   267925824     262144            268187968  221784600      6  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   489972568     262151            490234719         32         Sec GPT table   490234751          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  <answer216676> Ok, I figured out an alternative method - I was able to combine the partitions using the codediskutil mergePartitions/code command (e.g. codediskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ MacHD disk0s2 disk0s4/code).  Hope that helps anyone else with the same issue!
