Stop Excel for Mac (2011) continuing formatting from last cell entered? <body> This drives me loopy. Sometimes (see below for when), Excel gets fixated on some cell formatting and starts applying it every time I fill in any new blank cell.   I don't think this happens on Excel for Windows (though it's ages since I used the Windows version much). I'm looking for some way to stop it doing this.   strongTo replicate:/strong  1: Set up a simple excel sheet with groups of, say, columns, and mark them as groups with formatting e.g. background colour.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DFmCl.png" alt="enter image description here"  2: Fill in a row with some data (just type it in)...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZGmW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Excel decides that it likes that background colour so much, it's going to apply it everywhere from now on.   It's not just background colour:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kbISg.png" alt="enter image description here"  It picks up the formatting from the last cell it entered text into, or the last cell formatted, then gets stuck and starts applying it after entering text to any new cell, like trailing mud across a carpet.  It doesn't only wreck things like columns: it also causes big problems any time background colour is used for anything meaningful e.g. to mark the status of a project:  In a blank cell...img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/opPhi.png" alt="enter image description here" becomes... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3wNRu.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Is there a way to stop it doing this? To get Excel to stop applying formats to empty cells I enter text into, and just leave their formatting how it is?  I've hunted through options and browsed online, but can't find anything related.  hr  strongemSome observations:/em/strong   While creating the examples for this question, I noticed it looks like Excel is looking for patterns, then assuming I want to continue what it has decided to think is a pattern.   It seems to have two rules: "One thing, something else, then that one thing again strongemalways/em/strong means start doing stripes and never stop"...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yrtm9.png" alt="enter image description here" ...or... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5acaP.png" alt="enter image description here"   ...and "Two or more of something in a row when there has been a total of three of more of that thing strongemalways/em/strong means carry on doing it forever".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uI1ld.png" alt="enter image description here" ...or... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y4MXZ.png" alt="enter image description here"   ...but not... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmhOd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Oh, and it does it even if you skip a row or column:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKaXf.png" alt="enter image description here" ... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8PznD.png" alt="enter image description here" ... * emsigh/em *  hr  I just want it to stop.  Please, help me make it stop.  hr  strongEdit -/strong after turning "Autocomplete" off as suggested by Buscar, the same thing still happens, including after restarting Excel after changing the setting (checking the setting is still applied after restart):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FiAR4.png" alt="enter image description here" ... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aMCao.png" alt="enter image description here" ... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kxui1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer119266> It is correct that excel is looking for repeat pattern, and trying to help you by applying the last used = AutoComplete.  If you do not want it to do that turn that feature off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YsHOe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer119268> Found it! It's a setting under codePreferences &gt; Edit/code:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VlRcX.png" alt="enter image description here"     strongExtend data range formats and formulas/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4lQOy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Misread it as "date ranges" on the first trawl through preferences. Turning it off stops this happening.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gpL7.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  The comment about formulas seems to only mean that it doesn't fill empty cells with formulas when it thinks it's seen a pattern. After turning it off, it still does other automatic format adjustment e.g. incrementing formulas copied across a range:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCaAj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment139001> The closest I can find so far is to set blank cells to white fill. Excel seems to accept white cells as a valid formatting choice, and treats them with a respect it would never give to unformatted cells. Trouble is, white fill brings certain problems of its own, so I wouldn't call it an answer. <comment139105> you used the word SOMETIMES ?? means what ? <comment139106> If you read the rest of the question, you'll see that I describe when it happens in as much detail as I'm able to with the information available, with screenshot examples. I'll edit it to make it extra clear though... <comment139107> Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately it doesn't work, the same thing still happens, even after restarting Excel after disabling autocomplete (autocomplete is still turned off after restart). I just tried it and have included screenshots showing the results at the end of the question.
