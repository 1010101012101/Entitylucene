TextEdit app always opens with File Open dialog <body> Every time I open my TextEdit app it starts with the File Open dialog open.  How do I stop this?  <answer166737> I find this behaviour irritating too. I believe Mountain Lion introduced a new Open dialog to provide the option to save a new file in iCloud so that itâ€™s available from other iOS devices. You can disable this feature by going to System Preferences  iCloud  iCloud Drive Options then untick TextEdit.app and any other apps that have a similar behaviour.  <comment195452> This has irritated me forever - your question prompted me to actually have a look for how to fix it. Invicta just beat me to it, so +1 for everybody :) <comment195483> What OS? Could you also provide the screenshot? <comment195495> Yosemite - 10.10.1 (14B25). And it's simply the File Open dialog. <comment195496> That fixes it. It's beyond irritating. It's a bug.
