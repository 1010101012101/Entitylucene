Keyboard shortcut for stepping into zip archives without zip extensions in forklift 2? <body> In total commander you can "force step into" archives that are not named accordingly. For example if you have a file named codemy-file.jar/code (which is a zip file with some metadata) the only way to step into this archive that I've found in forklift 2 is to rename the file to codemy-file.zip/code first. This is both time consuming and should be unnecessary. Is there a keyboard shortcut for doing this without having to rename the file first in forklift 2?  <comment289689> If the app itself doesn't provide the feature of showing archive content of jar files **without renaming** them how would you apply a shortcut? <comment289699> Well I'm hoping that such a feature exists, that's essentially what I'm asking. <comment289708> The only thing which may help is a feature request: **For ideas, suggestions, bugreports or general questions about ForkLift, please email us at:** support@binarynights.com
