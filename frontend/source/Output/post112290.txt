Can anyone guide me or help me plss...I am trying to find a solution to the problem.  <answer116864> From my understanding you can only use an unlocked sprint iphone 5 on tmobile with edge network connection. Here is the info that I have found.      Sprint/Cricket/Virgin Mobile iPhone 5 can only be unlocked for T-Mobile / Simple Mobile and may only get Edge. It may also have issues with data/mms so you may or may not get internet or MMS (picture messaging). This is happening to some Sprint iPhone 5 devices and we are working on a fix. THERE ARE NO REFUNDS IF YOU HAVE A SPRINT iPhone 5 and experience issues with data/mms.   <answer182777> Us sprint 15.5 iOS 7.0.6 unlock  <comment136648> Can you add the source (link if possible) for your quote? <comment217716> Welcome to Ask Different!
