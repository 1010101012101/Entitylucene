Change date format in Numbers 3.2 <body> I recently updated Numbers to 3.2.  I want to be able to put a date in a cell numerically (8-22-14) and then have it show up with the month name, day, and year (August 22, 2014) without having to do a formula. I do not need the time.  <answer142878> ul liClick the Format button in the upper right/li liSelect the "Cell" tab/li liUnder Data Format select "Date &amp; Time"/li liUnder Date select your prefered format./li /ul  You should be able to enter a date in these newly formatted cells any format (like 8-22-14) and it should change to your selected format.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1oiXt.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UzKqI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment291073> This doesn't actually work for me. I paste a date in from a properly-formatted cell, and it says "automatic" in the format. When I set it to date & time, it just changes it back to automatic when I leave and reenter the cell.
