Some photos are not syncing to iPhone 4 <body> When syncing photos through iTunes to my iPhone 4, I am finding that certain photos are not syncing. In one event there are 600+ photos yet only 200 are syncing across. Does anybody know why?   <answer51976> Deleting the strongPhoto Cache/strong may do the trick.   To do so, just:  ol liFrom the Finder, choose Home from the Go menu./li liOnce there, open the Pictures folder and locate the iPhoto Library file. (For Aperture, this is called Aperture Library.)  If you have moved your iPhoto Library or Aperture Library to a different location, go to that location in Finder first./li liControl-click the iPhoto Library or Aperture Library file and choose Show Package Contents from the shortcut menu./li liIn the next window, locate the iPod Photo Cache folder and drag it to the Trash. strongImportant:/strong Do not remove or modify any other file within the library package. Removing or modifying other files may cause data loss. Close the Finder window./li /ol  Extracted from iTunes: Understanding the iPod Photo Cache folder.
