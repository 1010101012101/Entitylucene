Is there a free program for easily managing network locations? <body> I move around from the office and elsewhere quite a lot. When I'm in the office, I need a static IP, elsewhere I don't. I have network locations set up, but it's extremely tedious opening up Network Preferences to change it essentially every day.  Ideally I'd like an app where I can just select from the taskbar menu, like I can with Wireless networks, or a way to apply the IP config whenever I connect to that specific network.  I've found paying apps, like Sidekick, which are massive overkill (I don't want to shell out £20 for an app I'll only use one function of), I just want a tiny utility. Is there such a thing?  <answer68465> I found an applescript solution that does what I need. I've tweaked it a bit from the original, but it provides a one-button solution for switching my network location.  Here's the code I used:  precodetell application "System Events"         tell network preferences                  set activeLocation to the name of current location                  set allLocations to the name of every location                 copy "Quit" to the end of allLocations                  set deleteFromList to {activeLocation}                 set changeLocations to {}                 repeat with i from 1 to count allLocations                         if {allLocations's item i} is not in deleteFromList then                                 set changeLocations's end to allLocations's item i                         end if                 end repeat                  if (text of choiceLocation) = "Quit" then                 else                         do shell script "scselect '" &amp; (text of choiceLocation) &amp; "'"                 end if         end tell end tell /code/pre  Exporting this from AppleScript as an Application, and pinning it to my app bar gives me a one-button Network Location Switcher.  <answer68472> Check out something called ControlPlane. I've been using it for a while now and it can automatically change a whole array of settings from networks to printers on your mac depending on where you are like sidekick, but its strongfree/strong and so much better.  Lifehacker and Mac AppStorm featured it not long ago.  <answer68473> You can do that with Network locations. You can defined for example two profiles: work (fixed IP) and home (DHCP).  As you said chancing the location from codeSystem Preferences/code is tedious. However you can do the same from the  menu:   codeLocation/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WzErI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment79472> Please explain the solution you found, so that this answer can exist autonomously and will still be valid even if your link ever goes dead. <comment79473> @Gerry I've expanded a bit, the code is not copyrighted so I've just copied it all over. <comment79487> Oh wow, I didn't know that was there, that's much more useful! <comment79488> Yes, and it's out of the box ;-) <comment79489> Amazing that stuff like this doesn't come up in Google searches!
