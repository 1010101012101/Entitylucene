My iPod touch 4th general is not detecting wifi <body> My iPod touch 4 gen is not detecting the wifi from my Macbook laptop. My laptop is connected to Internet through ethernet. I can able to see my laptop name under wifi, when i try to select, it is only searching em(spinning wheel)/em. When i turn on my iPhone 3G wifi, it immediately detects em(tick mark)/em.  I have tried Restoring my iPod touch to the factory settings with wiping out all the data, still its the same. I tried resetting the Network, still the same. I also tried with different wifi, and all i see is the spinning wheel.  Not sure what is the problem is.  or  We can connect the usb cable to the laptop and access internet through the cable. Is it possible. In the End i want to access the interent in the iPod touch.  Thanks in Advance
