iBooks ePubs lost all cover art after iOS5 update <body> After I upgraded to iOS 5 on my iPad 2, iBooks no longer shows any cover art for ePubs that I have imported. Anything that is from the iBook store shows art fine, along with PDFs.  Is there a solution to this?  <answer27632> Yes, I found that if you remove the books from the iPhone, then add them again via sync the cover art should return.  <answer27811> Try removing all iBooks form the iPad and the re-sync them again that fixes it.  <comment31830> I have a lot of books on my iPad. Is deleting and re-adding them the only way to get back the cover art? I would really hate to have to go this route. <comment32900> Telling iTunes not to sync books, syncing, then enabling book sync, syncing, starting iBooks and *waiting* will cause the books to get art. This will take a while and seems to involve some sort of indexing.
