where can i remove desktop in mission control? <body> In mission control, I can add a desktop by pushing the button on the top right.   How do i remove a desktop?  Or where in my system preferences do i look to do this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0UQWr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer81271> Enter Mission Control and press kbdOption/kbd. A close button will appear in the top left corner of the miniature views of the desktops:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W40Mq.png" alt="enter image description here"  Simply press the close button to delete the desktop. Notice that you can't delete Desktop 1.  <answer100296> If you STILL can't close the "desktops", it may be because you actually just have multiple windows open rather than multiple desktops.  Close the entire program that's multiplying on your mission control and you should see a resolution.  <comment93711> @chrisjlee, also if you hover over the Desktop icon for ~ 2 seconds the "x" icon will appear. <comment118054> No, this doesn't work.
