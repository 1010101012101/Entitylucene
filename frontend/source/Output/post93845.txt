Creating a new folder in finder doesn't highlight "untitled folder" for renaming <body> I have a trivial but annoying finder bug and I'm wondering if I am the only one?   If I hit strongcommand-shift-N/strong in Finder to create a new folder it should automatically highlight the default name stronguntitled folder/strong ready for renaming. It works as expected in strongicon/strong and stronglist/strong views but not strongcolumn view/strong which is really annoying because I use column view all the time. I am running OS X 10.8.4 (12E55).  <answer93885> It works normally on my installation of 10.8.4, or ⇧⌘N also selects the untitled folder in column view.  You could try temporarily moving code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code somewhere else and relaunching Finder. Or quit background applications or try it on different account.  <comment110188> Trashing the .plis file did the trick, thanks Lauri
