Keep Maps/Waze on screen when answering call <body> I have my iPhone paired with my car's Bluetooth. I typically have my iPhone displaying Waze or Apple Maps in navigation mode. When I answer a call, the Phone app takes over the entire screen and I no longer see the map.  Is there anyway to keep the navigation on screen while I'm answering a phone call?  <answer227451> Only if you jailbreak your iphone and install a tweak that would allow you to do so.   <answer227459> After you accept the call, just double-click the home button and get back into the navigation app. You will be able to see the map and your call won't be interrupted.  <answer227666> It's not possible to make the call screen not come up. You'll have to double-click the Home button and go back to Waze. Or, if you have an iPhone 6s/Plus, 3D touching the left side of the screen and dragging right will send you back to the previous app.   <comment276239> That's a shame :( <comment276250> Not really an option as I am driving and don't want to have to fiddle about with my phone. <comment357460> whats the tweak called that allows you to do it?
