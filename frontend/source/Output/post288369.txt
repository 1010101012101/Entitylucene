Does anyone know how many external 4K displays the late-2014 27" 5K Retina iMac can support at once? <body> Yes, I realize this question was answered here, but the answers seem to specifically address the 2015 iMac--not the late-2014 iMac. I'm specifically wondering whether the late-2014 27" 5K iMac can support two external 4K monitors.
