Best app to read rss feed in real time <body> Could someone help to find best free / paid Mac OS or iOS (or both) app for reading rss feed in real time? I want the recent posts to appear at the top of screen with time, date and source. Also it should be minimalistic and functional design, ability to search and filter with key words. Any suggestions?  <answer211066> I've been using Reeder for some time now, it's pretty easy to use. There is a version for iOS and OS X. You can find all you're looking for in the settings section.
