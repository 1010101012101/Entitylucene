Change Limit before Mac Notifies You That The "Startup Disk Is Full"? <body> I always have this problem: Immediately after Mac Notifies You That The "Startup Disk Is Full", it pauses many of the applications I am using (eg. 6 out of 10), and this always makes me lose my unsaved data. How does this mechanism work? Can I change a parameter so that Mac notifies me emearlier/em (e.g. instead of 1GB short of full, mayb 8GB) and/or doesn't pause my applications?  <answer129597> Apparently there isn't a way to configure this. Someone wrote a shell script here to check the disk space and show you an alert message if it's getting full.  If you're familiar with the command line, you can save it somewhere and create a cron job to run it every few hours or so. I tested it and it worked fine.
