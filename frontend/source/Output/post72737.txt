Copying text gets jumbled around <body> I am doing a series of text correction for a game, and recieved the pdf of corrections from the customer. I use preview as a pdf reader.  On windows, I can freely copypaste the content back and forth, but for some reason, when I try on my mac, the sentences gets jumbled around.  As you can see from this screenshot, i copy the text from the right, and paste it in the tool on the left (Smultron) and the lines have changed order.  Does anyone know what might have caused this ? Happends repeatingly, and other   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HK0vN.png" alt="The copying"  <answer72764> I have the exact same problem all of the time. The only solution I have found is to try different PDF readers such as Tom has suggested and use Adobe Reader. PDFPen, Wondershare PDF Editor, and Skim are other options.  <comment84450> That green text looks like  a different PDF element. Probably thatâ€™s why. <comment84462> Do you have the same problem with Adobe Reader?
