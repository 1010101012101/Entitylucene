I can't add an external tester in TestFlight because the Add button is greyed out <body> I'm trying to add an external tester in TestFlight, but the Add button is greyed out:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsU0O.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is this because the app hasn't yet been approved by Apple, or some other reasons?  I tried in both Chrome 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit) and Safari 10.1.1 (12603.2.4) on macOS 10.12.5.  This same person is beta-testing another of my apps, so I'm sure the problem is not regarding their account or mine, just the particular app I'm trying to add them as a tester to.  <answer284517> You pasted the email address in the "Last Name" field. Simply move the mail to the first textbox with the "Email" label above.  <comment358795> What a dumb mistake I made! Thanks. BTW, you don't need a first or last name.
