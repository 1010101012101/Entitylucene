Decrease font size of all Menu Items in El Capitan <body> I have a 27" external monitor. The 1080p fonts are oversized: I know how to decrease them in individual apps - but what about the OS/X top menu bar? Note: i have already chosen the highest available display resolutions - nothing more to do in that sector. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcMty.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment335657> 'highest available'... is that actually the monitor's native resolution? Seems a bit low for a 27" screen. I'd expect one to be 1440p [2560x1440] <comment335741> That's a separate issue; the monitor supports 1440p but I do not (yet) have the proper cables.  This question is still valid: when having a 1080p available then let's figure out how to get the smallest fonts possible. <comment335743> It's not really a separate issue - as you cannot change the menu bar font size, except by changing the monitor resolution... <comment335768> @Tetsujin  If in fact the font size can not be changed - then feel free to add an answer as such.  If that's the facts then so it is.
