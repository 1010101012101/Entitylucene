How to reveal dot files in finder? <body> In the finder, files that begin with a code./code (dot) are not being shown for me.  How can I configure the finder to reveal all files, including ones that begin with a dot?  <answer250643> Open your Terminal (/Applications/Utilities), then enter:  codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code  Then restart your Finder by holding down Option and control- or right-clicking on the Finder's icon in your Dock and choosing Relaunch Finder.  To revert this behavior, simply change the YES to NO in that codedefaults/code command.  <answer250646> A handy related shortcut to reveal files that begin with a . (dot) in Finder dialogs that popup from a File-Open action is:  precodeShift + Command + "."  /code/pre  This toggles "." (dot) files to show/ hide without needing to restart Finder.  You can also define an alias to quickly toggle hidden files within Finder:  precodealias AllFilesTRUE='defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder' alias AllFilesFALSE='defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE; killall Finder' /code/pre  <comment311357> The keyboard shortcut is a great tip! I wish I could do that directly in Finder (not just in an "Open" window). <comment360502> Unfortunately this does not change the behaviour of finder in an Open File window, for example. But see abh's shortcut below
