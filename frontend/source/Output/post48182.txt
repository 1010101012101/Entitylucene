How to map the bottom right Trackpad corner to right-click programmatically? <body> I’m looking for a command (codedefaults write …/code) to enable right-click by tapping the bottom right Trackpad corner.  This can be enabled as follows: emSystem Preferences/em → emTrackpad/em → emPoint &amp; Click/em → enable emSecondary click/em and select em“Click in bottom right corner”/em.  However, I’m looking for a way to do this programmatically.  h3More details/h3  To find out which settings to modify using the codedefaults/code command, I usually do something like this…  ol liDisable the desired setting in System Preferences and close the preference pane./li liThen:  precodecd /tmp defaults read &gt; before /code/pre/li liThen, change the setting in System Preferences and close the preference pane. 4.  precodedefaults read &gt; after diff before after /code/pre/li /ol  A long time ago (I think it was still on Snow Leopard) this brought up the following solution:  precode# Map bottom right Trackpad corner to right-click defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadCornerSecondaryClick -int 2 defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadRightClick -bool true /code/pre  However, it seems like there’s more to it than just these two settings. I’ve tried disabling the setting in System Preferences, then running these commands, then logging out and back in again, but it had no effect.  <answer48200> I spent some more time debugging this, and it seems there are multiple setting locations (on multiple hosts) for the same setting.  AFAICT, each user gets his own host. The login screen uses a separate host. It makes sense to enable some settings (like Trackpad tap to click) for both these hosts.  Furthermore, OS X seems to have separate settings for Magic Trackpads and built-in MacBook Trackpads. The commands in my question only enable the Magic Trackpad settings.  Now, I try to enable it everywhere:  precode# Map bottom right Trackpad corner to right-click defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadCornerSecondaryClick -int 2 defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadRightClick -bool true defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.trackpadCornerClickBehavior -int 1 defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.enableSecondaryClick -bool true /code/pre  <comment55196> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/48112/12285 <comment66604> FTR, these commands (followed by a reboot) seemed to work fine on a clean OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion install.
