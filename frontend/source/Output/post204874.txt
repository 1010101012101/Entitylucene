OSX Automatic Time zone detects location but doesn't update <body> Recently my automatic timezone update stopped working. (ie it used to work but now it doesn't) Troubling thing is my mac detects the correct location (e.g. Golden, CO), but doesn't use this to update the timezone, despite "Set my timezone automatically..." being checked. See screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zEO2B.png" alt="Time &amp; Date preferences showing correct location (Golden, CO), but incorrect timezone (Pacific)" Anyone know how to fix this?  This issue now occurs with every network I have tried: work, home, airports, hotels, etc. And, I have already tried the usual set of fixes such as toggling auto timezone off and on, closing system preferences, rebooting, repairing permissions.  OS: OS X 10.9.5 (13F1112)  System: MacBook Pro Retina, 13-in mid-2014  <answer205894> Apparently at least a few others have had this problem. See [ https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7126456 ]. The only solution found to work in that discussion is to:  Solution: strongRe-install the OS./strong (Yikes!)   Other attempts in that discussion, including a few beyond those I mention above, didn't work. A new OS install seems rather drastic/painful, so for now I will stick with the   strongWork around:/strong Switch to manual timezone control.   Hopefully Apple will push a fix soon for Mavericks users, though perhaps all of the focus is on Yosemite and (soon) El Cap.  Any simpler solutions still welcome!  <answer256785> Here is another work around:  ol liLaunch the command line terminal (Launchpad--Terminal)/li liRun the following command:  codesudo ntpdate -u time.apple.com/code (It will ask for your password)/li /ol  That's it! Your clock is now updated with Apple's time server  <comment247014> Bizarre. How about Maps app geolocation? Is it similarly broken? Are you installing any VPN software or able to test with the Mac tethered to an iOS device with cellular data? <comment247025> I do have a VPN installed (Junos Pulse) for work. But this issue occurs whether or not I am logged in with it. I don't have an easy way to try tethered iOS now, but if I do will comment. <comment247272> @bmike: Also, maps app geolocation is spot on. Just like the pin placement in time & date. Problem is not updating the timezone to match. <comment316710> I have exactly the same problem: The location pin updates automatically, but the time zone and clock don't. Would love a less drastic solution. <comment320427> Nice work around. I don't see this as a true solution since I believe it only updates the time once, rather than setting up automatic updates for time. I edited the text accordingly. +1
