Mail App Keep Sent Mail <body> I noticed that with Sierra Mail App removed the option of keeping sent mail and in my case seems to default to 30 days to store the messages. I would like to keep the messages longer.  Is there anything I can do? Preferably I would like to avoid exporting mailboxes; I want to keep the mail and be able to search through them with Mail app when needed.  Note that the app is setup to store the sent messages in the server, however, the sent emails older than 30 days are also deleted from the mapped Exchange folder for sent email.
