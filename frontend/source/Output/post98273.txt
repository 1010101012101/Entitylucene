Remove GBA4iOS on iPhone 5, ios7b5 <body> I asked this in /r/applehelp and on regular StackExchange and nobody was able to provide a solution. About a month ago I gave into the craze to install the GBA4iOS app that was available without jailbreaking. When I installed it, it created a duplicate icon, which I would now like to get rid of (I already uninstalled the actual app). Has anyone else come across this issue? I looked all over Google and was unable to find anything other than restarting my phone, reinstalling the app &amp; trying to uninstall it before the install process completed, and setting my time back. None of these options worked. Any ideas?  <answer123697> I know how you feel. If you are talking about the phantom icon, I set my date back to normal, and shut my phone off for a few hours. This also delt with all my updating apps that were hung up from earlier that day!
