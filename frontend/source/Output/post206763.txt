Is there a way to fetch the icon file path of an application using AppleScript? <body> I'm currently writing an Alfred workflow in which I want to retrieve the icon file path linked to an application. Is there any way to do so natively using Apple Script ?  precodetell application "Finder"     set appPath to POSIX path of (path to application "Terminal")     set resourcesPath to appPath &amp; "Contents/Resources"     set contentFiles to (list folder resourcesPath) end tell /code/pre  Doing that I managed to get a list of file names but now I don't really know how to filter the code.icns/code file.  <answer206958> Try:  precodedo shell script "find " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of (path to application "Terminal") &amp; " -iname \"*.icns\";" /code/pre  <answer207274> I'm not familiar with Alfred however as far as AppleScript and getting an Application Bundle's Icon's pathname is typically not hardcoded, so it's not like you can get its path with a single command.  Additionally the value of codeCFBundleIconFile/code can be with and without the code.icns/code extension, so when building the fully qualified pathname of the Application Bundle's Icon you'll need to take that into consideration as you write your code.  As an example, using the built-in code/Applications/Calculator.app/code the code/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Info.plist/code shows that the emIcon file/em is "Calculator.icns" but doesn't give the path, although it will usually be within the Resources folder within the Application Bundle and in this case it's, code/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Resources/Calculator.icns/code.  So you'd have to get the value of codeCFBundleIconFile/code from the App's code.plist/code file and check whether or not it has the code.icns/code extension and test to see if it's in the default location, which it normally is but not always.  So in Terminal you'd query using codedefaults/code, e.g.:  precodedefaults read /Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIconFile /code/pre  In AppleScript you could set the results to a variable and go from there, e.g.:  precodeset appIcon to do shell script "defaults read /Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIconFile" /code/pre  It returns: codeCalculator.icns/code  Where as,  precodedefaults read /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIconFile /code/pre  Returns: codeTerminal/code  Yet the FQP is code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/Terminal.icns/code  <comment249251> What have you been able to achieve so far?  What have you tried?
