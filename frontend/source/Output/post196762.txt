Target Display Mode -- Pressing command-F2 does nothing <body> I would like to avail myself of the target display mode.  I have a brand new MacBook Pro Retnia, and I'd like to use it as a display for my Mac Pro (also brand new).  I followed the instructions on this page, and nothing happened when I pressed command F2.  Then I started scouring the forums.  I found several threads with the same problem, and I tried all the suggestions.  I checked my preferences to see if the keyboard assignments were messed up.  I tried restarting both computers in various orders.  I tried using internal and external keyboards on both computers.  I tried adding the fn key to the key command.  I spent a couple hours on this, but sadly, nothing worked.  So I'm really hoping that someone here has some idea what's going on.  This experience has really been disheartening.  I just bought these computers this year, and they failed at something so basic.  At this point, I would be satisfied just to see an error message telling me why cmd-F2 doesn't work.  I mean, if I try to eject a disk that has files that are currently in use, it will tell me why it can't eject right now.  But with this, I'm completely in the dark.  It's so frustrating!  <answer214759> iMac 27 5K Late 2014 model and later no longer support Target Display Mode.  <answer220015> I have found that Target Display Mode will work, but only if I do command-f2 from the stronglogin screen/strong. After logging in, the command does nothing.    Hope this helps someone!

Only iMacs (not-5k) do.  <comment235121> Did you try Fn/Cmd/F2 ? By default the Function keys are set to be 'media' keys not F-Keys. Fn swaps their 'function'. <comment235133> Hmmmâ€¦ [Apple KB](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592) appears to say only iMacs can do it <comment259373> While correct, this doesn't really help the OP (who is using an MBP). On the other hand, the MBP never supported Target Display Mode anyway :-)
