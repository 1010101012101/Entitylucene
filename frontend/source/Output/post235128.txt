How do I run a .sh or .command file in Terminal <body> I've always wanted to be able to run a script I've downloaded online directly from the Finder but just double clicking the file does not work.   <answer235129> Open Terminal, type in codesh /path/to/file/code and press enter.   Faster is to type codesh/code and a space and then drag the file to the window and release the icon anywhere on the window.  <answer235143> Alternatively, you could also do  precodecd /directory/with/executable chmod +x executable     # only required if your file is not already executable ./executable /code/pre  which will also run the executable file with its specified shell (if specified in the shebang code#!/bin/(shell)/code  <answer235158> The reason it doesn't work after downloading is the file permissions don't allow it. To enable execute permissions, open Terminal and type codechmod 755 /path/to/script/code. Instead of typing the full path, you can drag the script onto the Terminal window from Finder. Then, to execute, just enter code/path/to/script/code. Again, you can drag and drop the file onto the Terminal window. This syntax should execute the script using the correct shell as defined on the first line of the script.  <comment287574> What do you think will happen if the shell script is written in another shell 's syntax, such as tcsh, zsh, or ksh? The suffix `sh` denotes a shell script not "run the script in this shell". <comment287603> In the question it says "run a script I've downloaded online". Files downloaded from the Internet usually have permissions set to 644. <comment289601> @fd0 The [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) will take care of that. <comment289615> @user14492- When you invoke a shell script as `shell shell_script` the shebang line is ignored. The shell reads the first line as a comment. <comment338552> My file .sh opens in the text editor I created the file with. How can I open it in Terminal instead? I've set the right permissions. <comment355092> @bart you need to add the .command extension for executing a script within finder directly. <comment355094> @patrix i think it's not just internet, but every file that is copied from another filesystem onto yours because of the default mask in your account. <comment372766> @fd0, I don't understand. How is `sh /path/to/file` any semantically different from the alternative `/path/to/file.sh`? <comment372831> @Pacerier- In the first form, the invoking user must be able to read the file and chooses which interpreter will read the file. In the second form, the file's permissions must be read and execute for the invoking user and the interpreter is determined by the hash bang on the first line of the script. In both cases the kernel does not interpret the suffix on the file.
