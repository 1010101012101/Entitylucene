OSX Mavericks - Enabling Custom DHCP Options <body> I am using a new MAC running OSX Mavericks with a solaris ISC DHCPD server.  I have setup some additional options on the DHCPD server but it is my understanding that most DHCP clients don't request all DHCP Options.  I'm trying to ascertain how I configure OSX to send a DHCP request that includes these additional options.  My overall goal here is to issue option 26 which stipulates an MTU size.  <answer142437> As per: https://discussions.apple.com/message/26472927#26472927  This was the exact answer.
