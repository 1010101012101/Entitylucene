Keystrokes in right top corner <body> A friend of mine has a setting turned on on his macbook. As you can see in the screenshot below, the shift, function, control, alt and command keys show up in the top right corner when pressed. Where can this setting be turned off?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XN3IX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer177244> It must be something like :     System Preferences  Accessibility  Keyboard  Sticky keys options  Display pressed keys on screen   <comment209575> You can mark the question as answered of the left :)
