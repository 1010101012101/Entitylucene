iOS 10 iMessage app content not showing <body> Yesterday I updated my iPhone 6 to iOS 10.0.1. Several of my apps, like Pedometer++, Swarm, and Yelp, support iMessage, but instead of showing content I can share, they just show an icon. See the Pedometer++ screenshot below. Swarm, Yelp, etc., appear similarly.  The built-in #images and Music iMessage apps work correctly, as do simple sticker packs.  I've tried power-cycling my phone with no effect. I've also tried disabling and re-enabling the apps in "Manage" with no effect. Does anyone know what causes this behavior?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XD1rZ.jpg" alt="Screenshot"  <answer252879> Had the same issue. What resolved it was deleting each offending app completely and then reinstalling it. Hope that helps!  <comment314403> I've only seen this when the app hasn't fully downloaded in the background or the internet connection that it relies on is spotty. <comment314404> I did the upgrade more than 12 hours ago and the phone was on a good home wifi network for most of the time since then. The apps are fully downloaded and updated to the latest versions. <comment314405> Have you tried tapping the icon? <comment314408> Tapping the icon has no effect. It's completely static, no animation or anything. <comment314503> I have this same issue as well, though for me it affects some apps that have sticker packs (such as Aldo's Adventure), while others with stickers (such as GasBuddy) work correctly. <comment314649> I tried this with Yelp and it worked! I'll try the rest of my apps when I have wifi. Thanks! <comment314714> ...reinstalling worked immediately for Yelp but not other apps (Pedometer++, OpenTable, and Swarm), but power cycling the phone after reinstalling them fixed everything.
