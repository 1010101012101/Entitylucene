Enable file sharing for app from iTunes <body> Generally when I connect a iPhone to my computer, iTunes detects it and there is a option for File Sharing in iTunes which can be used to share files from the system to iPhone apps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ozEWf.png" alt="File Sharing example"  I am using an app called "Don't Touch This - Secret Data Vault". How can I enable the file sharing option for this app?  I followed this article but it is no use: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6029916/how-to-enable-file-sharing-for-my-app  <answer226246> You can't, it's up to the app developer to implement the feature.
