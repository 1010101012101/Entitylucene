localhost doesn't find all files in Sites-Folder <body> I have a strange problem:   I installed XAMPP long time ago and created a folder with an index.php file in my sites folder. When i start XAMPP and go to the browser emlocalhost/~username/em i can see the folder-structure.      strongI click on the folder i created some month ago, and safari shows me   the index.php file./strong       But now i create a new folder, with a new index-file in it, and   navigate to it, i'm getting an strong404 Error/strong.      strongBoth folders are in the same Directory: ~/Sites/strong   ol liOpen localhost/~username and i can see all folders in the ~/Sites - Folder/li liClicking on the folder created long time ago: works/li liClicking on the new folder created few seconds ago: Error 404/li /ol  I think there is a problem in the apache-config file, but i do not understand why apache finds only the new file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NYsyO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer60468> Ok, i don't know why but i changed the Document-Root-Folder in the XAMPP-Config-File to match /username/Sites.  Now the other folders work, too.   I don't understand why one folder works with the old configuration, and newer ones don't.   To all with the same problem:     The XAMP-Config-File must be the same document-root as the /etc/apache2 - config file on the mac   Strange thing, on my other Mac the Document-Paths are different but work.  <comment69545> Did you look at the permissions of the new folder? The content must be accessible by all users, otherwise Apache won't be able to read the content. <comment69552> How did you configure XAMPP? Can you paste your Apache configuration? <comment69585> @patrix: Permissions are the same for each folder. <comment69587> @Gerry: Do you mean the httpd.conf - file? I don't understand: in the xampp-httpd.conf the document root is different than in the httpd.conf - file from /etc/apache2 <comment69593> Then you probably have the built-in Apache running as well.
