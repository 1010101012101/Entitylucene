How to add a directory to my path that includes a colon and a space? <body> I installed MIT/GNU scheme and am trying to add the directory to my code$PATH/code variable so that I can run it from Terminal.  The app name codeMIT:GNU Scheme.app/code is a veritable "perfect storm" (for path names) as it includes a colon and a space.  I've tried adding each of the following to my code~/.bash_profile/code, none have worked:  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:"/other/paths:/Applications/MIT\:GNU\ Scheme.app/Contents/Resources" export PATH=$PATH:"/other/paths:/Applications/MIT\:GNU Scheme.app/Contents/Resources" export PATH=${PATH}:"/other/paths:/Applications/MIT\:GNU\ Scheme.app/Contents/Resources" export PATH=${PATH}:"/other/paths:/Applications/MIT\:GNU Scheme.app/Contents/Resources" /code/pre  <answer53018> It won't work. You have several options:  ol liCreate an alias for bash to run the command./li liCreate a symbolic link to the executable from a directory in your PATH. (I like to have a directory code~/bin/code at the front of my path for such things.)/li liCreate a symbolic link to code/Applications/MIT\:GNU\ Scheme.app/Contents/Resources/code somewhere and put the link in your PATH./li liRename the application./li /ol  <comment60614> Creating an alias worked, thanks. A symbolic link to the directory didn't for some reason, something specific to the app, I suppose. Is it OK to just rename a .app and have everything work as it should? <comment60616> I am not sure if just renaming the app will work. Perhaps you need to change the value of `CFBundleDisplayName` inside `Contents/Info.plist` as well. <comment60617> I'll stick with the alias, was just curious whether that was allowed.
