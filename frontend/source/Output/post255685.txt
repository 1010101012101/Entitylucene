How to copy time stamp to iOS clipboard? <body> Does anyone know of an easy way to get the current timestamp copied to the clipboard on iOS, either via built-in functionality or a small app?  <answer275210> I found an app that does exactly this.

Are you open to using an app to generate the timestamp? <comment318612> yes definitely open to using an app, I'm looking for one to be recommended because I haven't found one <comment346161> Confirmed on iPhone SE!
