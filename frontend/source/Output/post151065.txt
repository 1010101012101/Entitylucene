Commands not found in Terminal except echo <body> In my terminal basic commands are not found like:  precodemds-macbook-pro:~ ZILLURRAHMAN$ ls -bash: ls: command not found mds-macbook-pro:~ ZILLURRAHMAN$ env -bash: env: command not found mds-macbook-pro:~ ZILLURRAHMAN$ edit -bash: edit: command not found mds-macbook-pro:~ ZILLURRAHMAN$ open -bash: open: command not found mds-macbook-pro:~ ZILLURRAHMAN$ vi -bash: vi: command not found mds-macbook-pro:~ ZILLURRAHMAN$ tail -bash: tail: command not found mds-macbook-pro:~ ZILLURRAHMAN$ ls -bash: ls: command not found /code/pre  But echo is working. Like: codemds-macbook-pro:~ ZILLURRAHMAN$ echo $PATH “users/ZILLURRAHMAN/desktop/bioinformatics/bow-tie/bowtie2-2.2.3/BT2_HOME:??/code  I can call up programs like codepico/code using their full path like code/usr/bin/pico/code.  <answer151067> The issue is that your PATH is messed up. The reason why echo works is because it is a builtin command in the shell so the shell does not use your path to find the executable.  You need to see what script file had an codeexport PATH/code in it which set it to code“users/ZILLURRAHMAN/desktop/bioinformatics/bow-tie/bowtie2-2.2.3/BT2_HOME:??/code which has many error in it.  The usual files are ~/.profile ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile for more see many question on bash  <comment177736> The pico is another question.
