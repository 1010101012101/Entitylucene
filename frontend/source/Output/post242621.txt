How do I remove bookmarks from Terminal window? <body> With El Capitan, the Terminal app can automatically create marks, and bookmarks. However, there seems no obvious way to emdelete/em a bookmark that one's created (by accident). How can one emdelete/em a Terminal window bookmark?  <answer270059> I double this is an issue still, however, I thought I would answer it for anyone else who comes across this minor problem.  In El Capitan, Bookmarks are not saved across different Terminal sessions. Therefore, after exiting/re-opening Terminal, your bookmarks are cleared. If you want to have the same effect as this, you may use CMD+K.  <comment373643> Be advised, CMD+K is `Clear to start`, aka clear the terminal screen.
