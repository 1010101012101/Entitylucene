How to move dock to a corner? macOS Sierra <body> I know in previous versions of macOS, it was possible via command line to move the dock to a corner instead of centering it on the side it rests. Does anyone know of a way to do this with macOS Sierra?  With an older OS, the command was something like "defaults write com.apple.dock pinning -string end"  I'm presently up-to-date at the time of this posting to macOS Sierra 10.12.4.  I would like to have the dock on the bottom of the screen, but for it to align with the left side of the screen instead of the center.  <comment349595> Seems to be not possible anymore since Yosemite: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6600902?tstart=0
