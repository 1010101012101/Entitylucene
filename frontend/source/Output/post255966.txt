Is there hope for an Iphone 6s 4013 error, from soda spilling on the phone? <body> I have a 6s. My hubby tossed a drink and some of it got on my phone. The next morning it worked briefly (however, said it was 100% charged and I hadn't had it plugged in all night so I knew something was wrong) then it quit working and had a blinking apple. I tried doing a recover/restore several times on several computers with different cords, ports, etc. It extracts software, goes thru the whole recover, then when its preparing to restore, I see the apple screen as its loading for awhile then a screen that looks like a bad polaroid then back to the blinking apple. Then I get the 4013 error on my computer screen. Is there hope?   <comment319035> Did you follow [these support steps from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201444)?
