Managing iTunes Music with Multiple Devices <body> I recently started creating a new iTunes library of music that I am meticulously organizing with playlists, tags, and ratings. I'd like to share it on my girlfriend's phone but I want to ensure anything she does on her device i.e., set/change ratings/hearts, edit/change playlists, delete music, etc. isn't synced back to my library. Can I avoid this or do I need to create a separate library for her?  <comment263281> Are you also planning on making your computer the permanent sync hub for her device & authorised with her Apple ID too? Otherwise, the first time it's connected, it's very likely to become 'your phone'. iTunes was never designed to just 'give' someone your Library. The way round would be to set up a new Mac account & delicate the Library over; this would be a one-off task, after that they would become independent Libraries. <comment263464> Thanks, that's what I was thinking. <comment263468> oops, auto-correct - that would be 'duplicate' of course.
