Is it possible to color a table cell from the OS X color picker in Pages 5.1? <body> See picture. Only cell border and not the cell fill has the option to pick a color from the OS X color picker. Is there any workaround?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7jJY.png" alt="Custom pick color table cell pages"  <answer145590> What you have to do is choose a colour from the selection and then you will see a colour selector icon next to it, click it and the standard colour picker will appear..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ue0KO.png" alt="enter image description here"  odd I know!  <comment171590> You rock my socks
