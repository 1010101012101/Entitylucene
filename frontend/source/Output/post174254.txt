How do I force OSX to use IGMP version 2? <body> I am connected to an old NETGEAR smart-switch which only supports IGMPv2. It doesnt route multicast traffic to my mac because it joins the group using IGMPv3.  I tried this:  precodesysctl net.inet.igmp.default_version=2 /code/pre  but it doesn't work - OSX still sends out IGMPv3 packets (confirmed with wireshark).  Is there a way of forcing IGMPv2?  Im using Yosemite (10.10.2), in case that makes a difference.  <answer174284> There is a beginning of an answer here :  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3328862  <answer249799> This commands should forward to the correct IGMP.   precode sudo sysctl net.inet.igmp.default_version=2  sudo sysctl net.inet.igmp.sendra=0 /code/pre
