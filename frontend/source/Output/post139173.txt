Attempting to run find command gives "Permission denied" <body> I am attempting to obtain a list of applications on my Mac using codefind/code to search for code*.app/code. However, when running the command, I get a lot of Permission denied messages, as below.  The computer is mine and I have administrative access. How can I run the command without the errors?    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeLast login: Thu Jul 17 07:42:01 on ttys000 pamelas-mbp:~ pamelabohler-sampson$ find / -iname *.app &gt; ~/applications.txt find: /.DocumentRevisions-V100: Permission denied find: /.fseventsd: Permission denied find: /.MobileBackups: Permission denied find: /.Spotlight-V100: Permission denied find: /.Trashes: Permission denied find: /dev/fd/3: Not a directory find: /dev/fd/4: Not a directory find: /Library/Application Support/Apple/ParentalControls/Users: Permission denied find: /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC: Permission denied find: /Library/Caches/com.apple.Spotlight/schema.201.plist: Permission denied [...] find: /private/var/spool/postfix/private: Permission denied find: /private/var/spool/postfix/public: Permission denied find: /private/var/spool/postfix/saved: Permission denied find: /private/var/spool/postfix/trace: Permission denied find: /private/var/tmp/launchd: Permission denied find: /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd: Permission denied find: /System/Library/DirectoryServices/DefaultLocalDB/Default: Permission denied /code/pre  <answer139273> You need to be root to access certain system directories. Prepend your command with codesudo/code:    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo find / -iname *.app &gt; ~/applications.txt /code/pre  This will give a prompt for your password:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codePassword: /code/pre  Enter your password (the characters will not be shown), then press Enter. The find command will then be run as root and have access to the directories.  <answer139274> You get those messages because as a normal User You don't have permissions to view directories listed. For example code/.fseventsd/code is owned by root and only root can access it (codedrwx------  587 root  wheel/code). To get root privilages You have to run Your command with codesudo/code. In Your case it'll be:  precodesudo find / -iname *.app &gt; ~/applications.txt /code/pre  <comment164245> `sudo find / -iname *.app 2/dev/null  ~/applications.txt` for example, this will not write `/dev/fd/4` to the file. Standard error is overlooked, stout it piped directly into txt file.You may be better off with `sudo find .`...etc, or creating a locate db `sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb` , then `locate [string--see help for further options]` <comment164248> I would run that as `sudo find / -iname *app 2/dev/null  ~/applications.txt`
