how to stop spotlight indexing an attached camera <body> When I attach my video camera (for the purpose of importing some clips into FCP-X) I noticed that spotlight is indexing the camera (which does show up as an external disk when I connect it, via the USB cable)  I'm pretty sure that there is some contention between spotlight trying to index these files and FCPX trying to import them.  Is there a way to stop Spotlight from indexing the attached disk?  <answer17641> System Preferences  Spotlight  Privacy    Add your camera once and it should be remembered.  <comment19284> possible duplicate of [Spotlight: Don't Index a Volume](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3319/spotlight-dont-index-a-volume) The other answer has several command line options to disable spotlight as desired. <comment19286> Interesting.  I wonder if one can use Terminal to write a file on the camera?  Or would the camera delete extra files?
