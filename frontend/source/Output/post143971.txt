Sync keyboard shortcuts for ipad with iCloud <body> I have some useful text expander shortcuts on my MacBook Pro and I would like to get them synced with the shortcuts on my ipad. That way I don't have to maintain the same shortcut list in 2 places. Does anyone know how to do do this? I also know that there are text expander apps for ipad, but is any of them importing the shortcuts from iCloud?  <answer144132> I made it work by Going to Settings  iCloud and selecting to sync Documents &amp; data  <comment169615> I checked the options now and I'm syncing everything except Mail, Calendars and Photos.  Documents & data and Safari were off as well, but I turned them on now... Hope this does the trick.
