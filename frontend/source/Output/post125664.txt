SwitchResX broke my color profile, how to restore? <body> I wanted to try SwitchRes X and I installed it. It broke my color profile. Now my screen look pink and I cannot calibrate. If I go to my color profile it shows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLNbp.png" alt="Color Profile"  and if I click on calibrate it shows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TpYV7.png" alt="enter image description here"  and I removed the application. It didn't fix my problem. I tried to find the original color profile and it is gone in &lt;~/Library/ColorSync/Profiles or &lt;~User/Library/ColorSync/Profiles.  Besides reinstall the whole system, is there a way I can restore factory color profile? Thanks.  <comment147059> What do you mean by `~User/`? ~ is the home folder; / is the drive root. Try copying the file from /Library/ColorSync/Profiles (from the root of the disk, e.g. Macintosh HD). <comment147060> ~User means user's folder. For example admin or something you named. The profiles in /Library/ColorSync/Profiles are gone. <comment147070> I uploaded the Color Profiles from my Mac. You can get them here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/u0q39z18q880ni3/Color%20Profiles.zip. Put them in /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays/. Then select them in the Display pref pane. If that doesn't work, create a new user account and look in the Display pref pane using that account and see if it is there. PS: Make sure to uncheck the check box that says "Show profiles for this display only" <comment147072> Awesome. It works! <comment147073> You should make it an answer so I can close this topic.
