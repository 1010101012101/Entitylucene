LDAP user VNC screen sharing suddenly broke. Other LDAP users work, local admin works <body> I have a Mac (codemacOS/code codeSierra/code code10.12.6/code) with a local admin user, a local non-admin user, and many LDAP users. One of the LDAP users can't connect via VNC anymore, but can connect via SSH. Other LDAP users are able to connect via VNC and SSH, and the local admin and non-admin users can connect via VNC. This has affected the same user on two different boxes (both running the same version of codemacOS/code), so I'm guessing this is some kind of LDAP configuration issue, but I wasn't aware of any LDAP properties that controlled screen sharing access.  What might have changed to cause one of my LDAP users to lose VNC?
