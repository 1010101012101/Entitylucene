What is the best way to open an 80GB iPod classic? <body> I'm looking for the best way to open an iPod classic, meaning taking it apart. Mine got wet and now doesn't work and I would like to open it up and check that everythin's in place. I would like to do so in the safest way, so as not to dent the iPod. Any suggestions?  <answer11364> All you need is the plastic opening tools and follow this iFixit guide.  <answer94880> I've had good luck opening iPods with guitar picks in the past without damaging them. You can put them in the side crack and use them as a lever if you are gentle with it.

Otherwise, we'll just be guessing. <comment11900> @nayish I believe you may find one, at any shop selling electronic equipment/tools. At least something similar.. <comment11976> I'm not in the u.s... <comment11977> I'm looking for a way to this with tools found at any home... <comment12083> You're not likely going to find one, at least not without doing damage. There's a reason iFixit (and others) have produced custom tools for this.
