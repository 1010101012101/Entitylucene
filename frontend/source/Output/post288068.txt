What SteerMouse settings replicate the Microsoft Mouse "IntelliPoint pointer speed" set to fastest <body> I use an IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 (the greatest mouse of all time) on macOS Sierra.  I became really accustomed to the acceleration curve and sensitivity of the mouse when using the Microsoft IntelliPoint drivers (currently codeVersion 8.2.0 (v.305)/code ).  However this driver has issues with Sierra. I am looking for the exact settings for SteerMouse to replicate the fastest pointer speed setting from Microsoft IntelliPoint.  I have found 1850 sensitivity and 0.7 acceleration to come close, but not perfect.  strongUPDATE/strong  So I managed to get Microsoft IntelliPoint 8.2 working again on macOS Sierra. I had to reinstalled the driver. You may need to run codecsrutil disable/code, and you might also try changing the usb port its connected to.  I read somewhere that the sensitivity settings are built into the Microsoft IntelliPoint driver for macOS which means that it can potentially work in ways that SteerMouse could not - but I do not know much about how SteerMouse is implemented. Microsoft really should open source this driver.
