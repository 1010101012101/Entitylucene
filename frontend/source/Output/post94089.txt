.htaccess protected site cannot be accessed by iPad <body> I have been working on a website on a test server test.domain.com for a few weeks now. I was always able to access the .htaccess password protected site using my iPad mini as well as my iPhone or using the Simulator.   .htaccess used:  precodeAuthType Basic     AuthName "Test Server"     AuthUserFile /usr/local/www/test.domain.com/.htpasswd Require valid-user /code/pre  Somehow today I could not access the site anymore from my iPad mini. The site kept on loading, but no response was given to the GET request at all. No pop-up asking for the password either.  This was so weird. I tried reloading many times. Then I tried to access the site using Chrome on the same iPad where I was asked to enter the .htaccess username and password and it did work. For some off reason I had to enter the details twice, but anyways.   I decided to ask my partner to turn of the .htaccess password protection et voila! Access was granted again.  How come that I was not asked for entering the details again in Safari on the iPad? Where can I check how these details were stored if they had been?  <answer94090> Consider clearing Safari's cache of cookies and site specific data. This should clear Safari's record of login information used for your test web site.  h2Clear Cookies and Data/h2  ol liTap strongSettings/strong;/li liTap strongSafari/strong;/li liTap strongClear Cookies and Data/strong./li /ol  Apple publish further steps for clearing other Safari information in iOS: Safari web settings.
