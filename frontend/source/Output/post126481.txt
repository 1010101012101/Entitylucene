Change background colour of Quick Look / VIew? <body> Selecting an image in finder and pressing space to bring up Quick Look / View is something I use all the time.  However I'd prefer a med grey background colour as I work allot with transparent png's with white borders - so currently its hard to so see the edges.  Anyone know of a setting / app / method for setting this?  osx 10.9.2  <answer126490>    Switch to Fullscreen mode, there you have a black background color.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GSQNk.png" alt="enter image description here"  And then your background is black:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mBZyn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment148221> Ah of course! And I just googled you can hold Option + Space to open Quick View in fullscreen.
