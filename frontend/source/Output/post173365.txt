How to Hide All users from fresh boot With FileVault 2 <body> With System preferencesUsers &amp; Groups Login options display login window as "Name and Password" normally you need to type out the user name and password to sign in.  With FileVault2, when booting from shutdown, it overrides this issue by default and show all users. The only way to get it to keep the "name and password" is to put the computer to sleep, etc. which can be overridden with a shutdown.  Does anyone know a sudo command to force the hidden user names for any boot up situation?
