Asked to enable 2FA when it already was (or should have been) <body> I had a notification on my iPhone this morning suggesting I enable Two-Factor Authentication. However, it already was (or I thought it was). I called Apple support to ask why and she just kept reading a script that explains what 2FA is.   Is this normal, like some kind of double check? Or does it mean 2FA has been disabled at some point (and therefore I should check for suspicious activity)? I do get email notifications when I sign in to new devices and haven't had anything I don't recognise.
