Time machine - 10.12.5 no backup in x days‚Äù from TimeMachine notification <body> Previously you would get a notification that says "no backup in x days".. but in 10.12.5 there is no notification.. is that feature no longer there where it doesn't tell you that you haven't backed up for awhile?  if not how do i get it back?  thanks.  <answer286877> It's still there. I saw it recently. It may be broken however, because it was reporting not having backed up for over 20 days, when in reality my oldest backup was only a few days old. It may not be working when it should be.  <comment362155> thats odd since my last backup was april 29... and no notifications <comment363446> Me too, I have just discovered time machine hasn't backed up for a month, with no messages.
