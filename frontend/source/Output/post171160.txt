How to get the wi-fi connection status from terminal? <body> Sometimes, when waking up my mac, I get the message "Alert: No internet connection" on the Wi-Fi icon. I can solve it everytime by turning Wi-Fi off and on again. strongIs there a terminal command I can use to detect the current connection status?/strong I would like to run a script to turn Wi-Fi off and on automatically on waking up if so. Other solutions are welcome, too.  <answer171203> You do not need a script for tuning the WiFi on and connecting you, the OS X system does that already for you. If you look in Console (look for line containing Airport) and the lines after that will show it in action. Best is if you could publish that log in here to see why is it not working for you.  Here are some choices for you:  ol liIf you want a Scrip to continuously test if you are connected you could use this:  repeat     try         do shell script "ping -c 5 google.com"     on error         display dialog "You are not connected to the internet"     end try end repeat/li liOne of the simplest Terminal commands to see if you are connected and all connections that are active is the codeNetstat/code./li liTo see the details of your current connection use codeAirport-I/code in Terminal./li liNow if you want to use the Terminal to connect to your WiFi use following:/li /ol  Manually connect to WiFi  Turn On  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on /code/pre  Turn OFF codenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off/code  Find  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport scan /code/pre  Connect  precodenetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 WIFI_SSID_I_WANT_TO_JOIN WIFI_PASSWORD /code/pre  If you do not know it use the Find the SSID- BSSID  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -s /code/pre  ol start="5" liFinlay, if you do this frequently create a script in Apple Script app./li /ol  Save the following apple script as application.

Wit the router I have at work this is sometimes necessary to reconnect to the wifi network.
