Do computer mice really feel different when used on a MacBook? Will using a mouse specialized for Macs feel any different? <body> I own a new MacBook Pro and I've been using it without a mouse since I brought it out of the box.  I tried to use the wireless mouse (not Bluetooth, connected to the laptop using a receiver plugged in a USB port) I used on my old laptop. However, it felt different. It was somehow slower. The cursor didn't move as fast as  the cursor moves in Windows.  Is it really like this?  I found out that Apple sells a Bluetooth mouse called "Magic Mouse" for their devices. Will using that feel any different?  <answer265720> Apparently it's just a difference in the mouse pointer acceleration.  It can be adjusted in System Preferences  Mouse  Then adjust the tracking speed.  Thanks calum_b.  <comment333156> Did you adjust the mouse pointer acceleration settings in System Preferences? In general, I've found no significant difference between OS X and Windows when using a generic, third-party mouse. However, a mouse that uses a proprietary wireless dongle (e.g. many Logitech models) will of course only be as good as its OS X drivers. <comment333157> No wonder. It feels the same as Windows now. Thanks! It's a Logitech mouse. What do you mean with it only being as good as its OS X drivers? Oh, and is there any way to disable natural scrolling only when there is a mouse?
