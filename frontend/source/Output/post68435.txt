How to block unwanted sites from opening? <body> How do you block websites on Safari?  <answer68438> You can add an entry to your code/etc/hosts/code file. For each site you want to block, add a line at the bottom, in the form:  code127.0.0.1 site-to-block.com/code  <comment79468> aer you looking to block just a single site, or a whole bunch of sites?  The solution could be different depending on your situation. <comment79491> Why was the question downvoted - I could see a user wanting to use this to deal with popups/popunders - which without some of the neat add ons to other browsers is a problem in safari.
