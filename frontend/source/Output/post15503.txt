Why are Ctrl+a and Ctrl+f broken in Snow Leopard? <body> In most text areas, ctrl-a and ctrl-f used to move my cursor to the beginning/end of the line, but now I get "^A" printed to terminal, and nothing happens in other input areas.    Any ideas what happened?  <answer15510> It was my bash key bindings - I had "set -o vi" in .bashrc.  <comment16853> So, the move is broken in textedit too? CTRL-A beginnig of line, CTRL-E end of line, CTRL-F one char right, CTRL-B one char left. <comment16856> hmm, works in textedit, must be my bash key bindings <comment16861> So use, ESC-0 for the beginning of the line, "$" to end, and so on... :) but, you probably know "vi" when activated the vi-mode ;) (i'm using it too) :) <comment16877> indeed - just overlooked that I would lose the emacs-style bindings :) <comment17747> I also have it broken (OS-X Lion Preview4) but I don't have any "set -o vi" settings. Ctrl-A does not have any effect! WTF? I cannot use screen to switch or create new screen sessions.
