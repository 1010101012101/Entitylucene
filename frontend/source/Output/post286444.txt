Remap F10 from mute speakers to mute microphone <body> I want to change the F10 hotkey from muting sound output to muting the input. I know I can use Applescript to create a push to talk feature (How to mute the microphone on Key-Down and unmute it on Key-Up? but that is not what I want. I want to simply hit F10 and have it mute all my inputs, and when I hit F10 have it re-enable them (so when I'm podcasting I can mute myself easily, and unmute myself without having to click/type a lot). I went through the keybaoard settings and can't find the F10 mapping to change it (and no, I don't want to disable all my function keys either).   <comment361393> All you need do is modify the linked structure with an integer switch rather than a key-down test <comment361532> Any hints on this? <comment361651> what's wrong with changing the linked QA to use a toggle switch?
