Time Machine - An error occurred while restoring from the backup <body> Having some trouble restoring a Time Machine backup. After some initial disk problems we had to reinstall OSX and this is what has been done thus far:  ol liBooted into Internet Recovery Mode (Command (⌘) – Option (⌥) – R)/li liReinstalled OSX/li liRebooted and into Recovery Mode (Option (⌥) – R)/li liSelected to Restore from the Time Machine Backup/li liRestore goes fine for 6+ hours (91%) and then fails with the message, "An error occurred while restoring from the backup. Restart your computer, and then try again"/li liI tried an older backup from the same sparse bundle but having the same problem./li /ol  I have tried this three times but it fails in the same location each time. Any suggestions at this point would be Welcome.  <comment359472> Can you clarify a few things: (1) What do you mean by _some initial disk problems_? (2) What version of macOS are you running? (3) What exact model of Mac are you using? (4) Have you tested your Mac's internal drive with Disk Utility etc? (5) Have you tested the TM backup drive with Disk Utility etc? (6) When you tried the older backup, was that on the same HD as the other backup? (7) And finally, how much older was the older backup you tried? <comment359491> 1. Some file corruptions. Mac would not fully boot. Reinstalled the OS and checked the drive and it came back fine according to diskutil. 2. Latest Mavericks. 3. MacBook Pro - Model A1502. 4. Yes. Came back clean. 5. No. This I have not done. Was googling this process as I saw you asked for it. 6. Yes. Same drive. 7. 2 days.
