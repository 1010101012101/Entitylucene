Xcode 6.4 â€“ crash on selecting project in sidebar <body> My Xcode is crashing hard whenever I click on any project within the workspace in the Project Navigator sidebar. I have attached a screenshot of the error I'm getting.  Some notes:  ul liI use Xcode on this machine 5 days a week, and I have for over a year. This is a brand new issue./li liThis is happening with EVERY project, so I don't think it has to do with corrupt project data. Collaborators are not seeing this issue on their machines./li liI have tried clearing all derived data already. No help./li liI have tried deleting and reinstalling Xcode completely. No help./li liI am running OS X 10.10.4./li /ul  Even if you don't have a guaranteed fix, I would really appreciate some suggestions. I'm running low on ideas.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7JUx.png" alt="enter image description here"
