iPhoto library gone - instead I see the AlbumData.xml file <body> My iPhoto library has gone. When I start iPhoto, it ask for a new library. I use iPhoto '11 (version 9.2) and my iPhoto Library folder was packaged. Instead of the package, I now have a folder called iPhoto Library with 2 files in it: AlbumData.xml (13.8 MB) and iPhoto.ipspot (51 b). As far as I understand from previous threads, the AlbumData.xml file does not contain photos, only album metadata. I mention it, since I can see in my backup that I did not have this iPhoto Library folder before, just the package. Could I have accidentally unpackaged it?  I have a backup of my iPhoto Library but I have not put that back yet, as it does not contain my latest photos and I'm hoping for a better solution. Also, I would like to understand what happend.
