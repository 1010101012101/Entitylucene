How does a reminder that has both a location and time reminder work? <body> I can add a reminder with both "Remind me on a day" and "Remind me at a location" turned on.  When I turn both on, how does the remind work? Is it:  ol lionly at the specified time if I arrive/leave the location/li liat the specific time or if I arrive/leave the location/li lisomething else?/li /ol  <answer225112> The reminder alerts do not work in tandem. This means it will alert you:  ul liAt the exact date and time you have specified/li liAND when you enter/exit the specified geofence/li /ul  <comment291749> The exact wording from official app help: "If you set both types of notifications for a reminder, you are notified either at the time you specify, or when youâ€™re at the location, whichever comes first."
