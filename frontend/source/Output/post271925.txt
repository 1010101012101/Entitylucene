Changing opacity of Mac terminal from command line <body> I was wondering if there was a way of modifying the Mac terminal opacity just from the command line. I know that the manual way is to go to Terminal preferences, but is there a programatic way to do it?  Note: I am on OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6  <comment341837> I do not know when this stopped to work to get alpha from `osascript -e "tell application \"Terminal\" to get background color of current settings of window 1"` Setting the color with aplpha this way also do not work... The only thing I managed to do is to create couple of profiles with different alpha value on the background and switch them with `osascript -e "tell application \"Terminal\" to set current settings of window 1 to settings set \"Pro\""`
