Folder /label highlighting in Mavericks 10.9 <body> I used the tags / label color highlighting feature in the past OS's extensively to order my folders. Now I've changed to 10.9 they seem to have all changed to a little dot, which is not as easy to see. Is there a way to get Mavericks to allow you to color the file / folder name as in previous versions of the OS?  hr  Background  I tend to view my folders using the list view as below  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PWXGl.png" alt="list view"  <answer124894> I would recommend to use an application called Folders Factory for that.  You can download it from the Mac App Store and it only costs $2.99, so it will not break your budget, but it has some very fancy features you might like.  <answer125586> I recommend the free Extension "XtraFinder". Since Version 0.19 there is a new Option in "Appearance" called "Leagacy Color Label Painting" which brings back the color background in the finder-listmode.   <comment146190> Thanks @buscar - Do you know if that allows you to change the add colour to the a folder name rather than colouring the folder itself - I tend to view my folders in list view so colouring the folders wouldnt work that well (also if they were files not folders i think id run into an issue) <comment146199> Not easy, those are system level fonts and not recommended to change.
