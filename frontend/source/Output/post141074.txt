Chronic 0-length voice mail messages <body> I've got an iPhone 4 model MD146LL/A on Sprint's network. I get crummy service at the house (Sprint's coverage map is an absolute lie with respect to my area).  Most of the time, the phone does not ring during a call. After the missed call, I often get a 0-length voice mail message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wSfIf.png" alt="zero-length voice mail"  From past experience in answering "did you get my message" questions, I know a voice mail was left. In fact, three of the four messages shown above are 0 length even though I got emails referencing the voice mail message. The majority of voice mail messages are like this on the phone.  The iPhone is clearly not receiving the messages properly. I can't "opt-out" of voice mails; and I the damn phone does emnot/em do the right thing and ensure it actually receives the data it requests (or data that is pushed to it).  How can I force the iPhone to validate the data it receives when using the cellular radios? If the data validation fails, then how I can I force it to re-download the message?  <answer141097> This is a sprint customer service issue.  You have the wrong VM type attached to your account.  FWIW, there is a VM attached to your line that emis/em retaining the vm's and you can call it and listen, it's not compatible with iPhone visual voicemail.  <comment166368> Thanks Tyson. I'm going to have to wait a while to test this. I just don't have the strength at the moment to navigate all the obstacles Sprint puts in place to get this sort of problem fixed.
