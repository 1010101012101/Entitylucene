Can I connect 3 displays to a late 2012 Mac Mini? <body> I have the late 2012 Mac Mini, which has a HDMI port and a Thunderbolt port.  I have 3 1080p monitors that each have DVI, HDMI and VGA. Is it possible to connect them to my Mini, no mirroring?  <comment157640> did you look up your system specs? <comment157641> @Buscarì›ƒ yes, it's the late 2012 i7 Mini. <comment157647> Indeed it is. Thanks!
