Can I send as someone else using Mail.app on iPad? <body> Is this possible?  In normal MS Outlook you can send as someone else (if you are on the distribution group I think). It's an option when you reply to an email.  Can you do the same using Mail.app on iPad?  <answer86209> Mail.app on iPad does not support sending as or send on behalf of. So there is no way you can do this via Mail.app.  But you can try this on a Macbook for example: in Mail  Preferences  Accounts it will show the account you have set up. Next tothe emailaddress, type a comma and then the other email you want to send from. Save it and now when you compose a mail, you can choose which one to send from.  <comment99454> What Outlook app are you using on your iPad? There is no official Outlook by Microsoft in the App Store. <comment99455> @Robuust just the default included mail client - connecting to ms exchange server <comment99490> Thank you, you just told us how to send junk emails. :( <comment99590> @Borderline its a valid problem for us, our employees are on various distribution groups and don;t want to cnfuse customers
