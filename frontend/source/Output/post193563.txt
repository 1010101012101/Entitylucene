How to type backslash and pipe? (Czech layout, USB keyboard) <body> I use an USB keyboard with my Macbook Pro - no choice here, some of the keys of internal keyboard are damaged. The Keyboard is from Genius, type LuxeMate i200. I use Czech QWERTY layout.  Everything pretty much works, although I can't seem to find a way how to type strongbackslash/strong code\/code and strongpipe/strong code|/code characters.  Above the right Enter, I have a mysterious key with following characters:  ul lifirst row: code|/code code)/code code;/code/li lisecond row: code\/code codeň/code code¨/code (and "circle in front of x" i can't even type)/li /ul  I've tried the following:  ul likey: code¨/code/li lileft SHIFT + key: `/li liright SHIFT + key: `/li lileft ALT + key: code¨/code/li liright ALT + key: code¨/code/li lileft SHIFT + key: code"/code/li liright SHIFT + key: code"/code/li liFN + key: code¨/code/li /ul  I would really like to avoid switching between keyboards OR copying the characters from Google, as I use them a lot. Can someone help me please?  EDIT: Here is a photo of the keyboard, if that helps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9whYK.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my keyboard"  EDIT 2: Thanks @krnk, the keyboard viewer helped with the backslash character! I still have a problem with the pipe character though.  What the viewer shows is not consistent with the keyboard (there is no key between left shift and Z key, for example, which would solve my problem with the pipe). Is that maybe another symptom of misconfiguration?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WPAf1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there anything else I could try besides "changing keyboard type" (which I already did)?  <comment231447> @krnk: Thanks a lot for your suggestion, it helped! I have updated my question. <comment231490> That is what I meant by "changing keyboard type", so yes, I did. The assistant asked me for key right of L Shift (Z) and left of R Shift (- and _). The keyboard viewer still shows incorrect layout (key right of as backslash).
