I tried to delete code~/.ssh/known_hosts/code, but nothing changes. It should not be a serverside problem as I can't login 4 linux servers, but my another Mac computer (iMac) can log in all of them.  I used to be able to log in even yesterday. I may have done some changes (upgrading software using homebrew) but nothing directly related to ssh.  <comment164555> What happens when you type 'ssh user@server'? <comment164587> @сергей No, nothing changed <comment165608> I fixed it by [reinstalling Mavericks](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13871)
