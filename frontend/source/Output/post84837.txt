Select word under cursor using a keyboard shortcut? <body> What is the keyboard shortcut to select a word that your typing cursor is currently on ?  For example, if the word I want to select is codeWorld/code, while the typing cursor is between one of the letters of that word such as codeThis Wo|rld is huge/code, what do I press to select only codeWorld/code ?  <answer84845> I don't know a single shortcut to select the word, but you can do it in two steps, by first moving the cursor to the start of the word, then select the word.  1) Move cursor to left of word:  ⌥←  2) Select word to right of cursor:  ⇧⌥→  Of course you could do a similar thing with moving to the right of the word with ⌥→ then selecting the word to the left of the cursor with ⇧⌥← if you prefer.  <answer84882> You could also create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:  precode{     "~w" = selectWord:; // option-w } /code/pre  You have to reopen applications to apply changes. DefaultKeyBinding.dict doesn't work in Xcode or some cross-platform applications, but you could use KeyRemap4MacBook as a fallback:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;Xcode&lt;/name&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;private.xcode&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;only&gt;XCODE&lt;/only&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::W, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <answer275513> In the current version of Xcode, you can set up the shortcut in Preferences... ( ⌘, ) - Key Bindings, filter "select word", then you can choose a new shorcut by typing it in the field "Key" associated  <comment97695> That is a good substitute. <comment97798> Ahh I actually wanted this feature to be used in Xcode. THanks though. <comment167797> I'm using the updated version of KeyRemap4MacBook (aka "Karabiner") and couldn't get the XML config to work (OPT-W insists on inserting a greek :sigma: rather than running the macro). However, the `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` worked fine (OSX Mavericks). <comment278253> omg! why xcode don't have built-in hotkey for such useful action?
