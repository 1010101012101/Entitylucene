Connecting a PC PS/2 keyboard to Mac <body> I've just bought a PS/2 to USB cable to use PS/2 PC keyboard (Compaq SK-2860 and Packard Bell 6301N) in my Mac (OS X 10.8.4) because my Mac's wireless keyboard doesn't work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILhli.jpg" width="150" title="PS/2 to USB cable"  …but my Mac does not identify the keyboard. I've got this window:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pwhnv.png" width="450" title="Keyboard Setup Assistant"   …but when I press the key to the right of kbd shift/kbd nothing happens.  The cable works in Windows XP, and Linux Ubuntu well. I've seen this similar question but please note my issue is related to a specific strongPC/strong keyboard. What can I do?  <answer106565> This are the steps I've follow to use my keyboard, I've tried so many things that I don't know which step is mandatory:   ul liShut down Mac and wireless keyboard/li liPlug in the keyboard with the PS/2 USB adapter/li liSwitch on Mac/li /ul  If Mac is stuck to the first gray window try to use a different USB in my case if I use the first USB the keyboard doesn't work but if I use the fourth it  works.  If the keyboard still doesn't work I've try to install PS/2 driver with the Kext Utility.  Maybe first you should remove:  code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist/code  At the login the keyboard should be operative so you can write the password with your PS/2 keyboard. I simply ignore the Identify keyboard window that appear after login.  <answer239487> I found out if you plug everything in, the PS/2 keyboard won't work right away. If you then hit the Caps Lock key on your Mac for a few times until the Caps Lock light on the PS/2 keyboard turns on and off, then it will start working. Strange.
