What is /Volumes/firmwaresyncd? <body> I keep seeing this in my logs:  precode&gt; 10/5/15 3:45:16.532 AM deleted[366]: normalizeUserMountpoint:738 &gt; volRoot failed for /Volumes/firmwaresyncd.G3PNKw /code/pre  What is it? Is it related to the firmware 0day hack from July?   I'm on 10.11, 2012 mbp.  <comment252328> What does `ls -ld /Volumes/firm*` return? <comment252330> Quick explanation: `firmwaresyncd runs at boot time to synchronize the firmware file(s) from the root filesystem to the EFI System Partition (ESP).`        _(https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/firmwaresyncd.8.html)_ - I don't think that it's related to the firmware hack, at least I couldn't find anything related. <comment361992> I agree this is disturbing. I found it running after I woke the computer from sleep and I found this volume. /Volumes/firmwaresyncd.61c316
