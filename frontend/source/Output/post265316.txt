Keep all system logs, forever <body> In console app I can see only couple codesystem.log.${i}.gz/code archived log files that can only show me info about last 10-15 days. How to keep strongall/strong logs archived somewhere, forever ?  <comment332666> Use a dedicated syslog server and send the logs there. Alternatively, change the log rotation to never delete anything. <comment332667> You could give me a terminal command / article that explains just that: `Alternatively, change the log rotation to never delete anything.` ? <comment333033> Here's how you can configure syslog to send data to a dedicated syslog server: https://wiki.splunk.com/Community:HowTo_Configure_Mac_OS_X_Syslog_To_Forward_Data  And if you want to play with log rotation, apparently (according to a quick DuckDuckGo search), you wanna look at /etc/asl.conf and man asl.conf.  I'm not familiar with asl, so I don't know how it works, but looking at the file and man page I imagine it can be figured out pretty quick.
