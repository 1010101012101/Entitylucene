Installing gnuplot (or similar) on Lion <body> All the packages needed to install gnuplot through MacPorts on Lion succeed, except for aquaterm.  Installing gnuplot through Fink is far less lucky on Lion. Fink bails out after only a third of the packages needed for gnuplot have been installed, but Fink does install aquaterm.  Is there a way to 'port install gnuplot' while pointing MacPorts to the aquaterm installation generated by Fink?  Also nice would be to know of a method to install gnuplot on Lion that uses neither Fink nor MacPorts. Learning about a replacement for gnuplot itself on OSX would be handy.  <answer25512> I used Homebrew to install gnuplot. I believe I had to use specify --nolua. First, I installed aqua term: codebrew install aquaterm/code. Then I installed gnuplot with codebrew install gnuplot --nolua/code and that was it, gnuplot picked up aquaterm immediately.  Additionally, I sometimes use octave to plot. It's also got a formula in Homebrew, so just run codebrew install octave/code and away you go!  <answer41764> Download Maxima. It contains a working Gnuplot.app for Lion.  <comment28889> What is the error on macports's aquaterm - fixing this would probably be easier than mixing Fink and macports <comment28952> Very nice. Homebrew installed gnuplot with no trouble and with what seems to be a fraction of the dependencies, but that could be because it is willing to use packages that are already installed (neither Fink nor MacPorts will do so). I didn't have to use --nolua, but again, brew may have used one that was already installed. Octave also seems nice, but it can't do least-squares fitting to an arbitrary function, one of the features I need. <comment47388> I dunno what you're using Gnuplot for, but perhaps Apple's Grapher app can do what you need? It's bundled with OS X.
