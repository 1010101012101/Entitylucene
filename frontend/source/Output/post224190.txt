FTP file to specific path on server <body> I try to FTP a file with a one liner in a shell from a mac to a folder on my server. Doing the same in the FTP-Shell is not a problem for me, but doing this in one line is not possible to me.  I even do not succeed with the following simple connecttest, which I guess is standard on every other system:  precodeftp name:password@mysite /code/pre  How to transfer a file in one commandline with following info?  precodefilename: &lt;file&gt; server:&lt;server&gt; username:&lt;username&gt; password:&lt;password&gt; pathonserver:&lt;path&gt; /code/pre  codeftp &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;server&gt; "cd &lt;path&gt;;put &lt;file&gt;"/code ?  <answer224196> To upload a file to the specific path using codeftp/code command you have to:  precodeftp -u ftp://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@&lt;server&gt;/&lt;path&gt; /path/to/file /code/pre  From codeman ftp/code:   precode -u URL file [...]              Upload files on the command line to URL where URL is one of              the ftp URL types as supported by auto-fetch (with an              optional target filename for single file uploads), and file              is one or more local files to be uploaded. /code/pre   For codeauto-fetch/code URLs also look into codeman ftp/code under codeAUTO-FETCHING FILES/code section.  <comment271852> does `ftp ftp://user:pass@server/path` work ? <comment271859> Yes that works. Thanks, thats a good start. And how to put the file ? <comment271860> It's `ftp -u ftp://user:pass@server/path /path/to/file`.
