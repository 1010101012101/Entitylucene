muting start-up sound on Lion <body> How can I permanently mute the start-up sound on Lion?  StartupSound.prefPane isn't compatible with Lion. I found Psst, and I guess it's the best option, but it still looks like a hack. Any better ideas?  <answer32860> Before I start up my MacBook in the library, I plug in a headset or earbuds (from my phone or iPod).  Hardware mute.  Works with either OS.  <answer32868> Maybe not the answer you are looking for, but:  I keep the volume of my MacBook to zero (so no sound on startup) since I do not want sound without earphones or my stereo connected anyway - Mac OS saves different volume settings for “something plugged in” and “nothing plugged in”.  At least, works for me.  <comment37560> Would a shutdown item that mutes the volume be acceptable? <comment37943> @bmike that doesn't sound like too bad an option. Do you know how to do that? If so, can you post it as an answer?
