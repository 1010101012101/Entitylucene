Which 15" MacBook Pro should I buy? 2015 or 2016? <body> I need a new laptop and I am wondering if I should buy the 15" MacBook Pro 2015 or the new MacBook Pro 2016.  Which one you recommend? Is it really worthy the 2016 upgrade?  I hope my question is not off topic. Thanks  <answer259249> I have listed some of the differences here, but if you want a full comparison, go to this link: http://www.apple.com/mac/compare/results/?product1=macbook-pro-2015-15&amp;product2=macbook-pro-touchbar-15  Here are the things that the MacBook Pro 2016 has that the 2015 model doesn't:  ul liNewer is thinner/li liNewer has Touch Bar/li liNewer has Touch ID/li liNewer has Wide Color Gamut/li liNewer has brighter display/li liBetter Battery/li liNewer only has 4 Thunder Bolt 3 ports which also doubles as USB C and also is charging(but no other ports unfortunately, you will have to use adapters for more ports)/li liNewer has Bluetooth 4.2(faster and better bluetooth)/li liNewer has no MagSafe(in my opinion MagSafe is better than USB C)/li liNewer has better processors(graphics, cpu)/li liNewer has bigger trackpad/touchpad/li liNewer has more storage if you want/li /ul  In my opinion, this was a disappointing release. The only major changes is the addition of Touch id and the Touch bar. The only ports are the 4 Thunderbolt/USB C ports which makes it even more disappointing. If you really want the faster processors, the Touch Bar and Touch id, and the more storage, then go for it. I'd either wait for the next release, or buy the 2015 model as it doesn't seem worth it to buy the 2016 model  Hope this helps!  <comment324290> thanks..the thing is that I am aware about all the specs and actually I desire more a suggestion/opinion about which one purchase..at the moment I am running on a Late 2011 Macbook pro 15" and to be more than honest..he never disappointed me. but the new one it is so expensive and maybe doesn't worth me to buy it when I can get the 2015 model for less.. <comment324310> @no_one In the last paragraph of my answer I gave my opinion/suggestion about buying it or not. Perhaps you missed that. <comment324313> yes! thanks indeed! my comment was for the other possible respondents <comment324337> @no_one oh, i see <comment324340> Currently, the question is almost entirely based on opinion. It would help if you could list what you are going to use the MBP for, and whether there are any constraints on price, or whether there are certain features/disadvantages that you don't require/bother you. If not, you could just review the tech specs of both MBPs and compare yourself.
