How do I debug stalled out package verification? <body> Every time I try to install any new software this happens...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRhWe.png" alt="Endlessly Verifying"  The package starts verifying, but then makes no progress.  Eventually I give up and cancel the install.  How can I diagnose this so I can start doing new things with my computer again?  I've tried examining the Console, but I see no related error messages.  <comment294032> I would google install pkg from the command line in debug mode. <comment294036> `sudo installer -pkg [PACKAGE].pkg -target [TARGET]`
