How to move from iTunes book library to iBooks app <body> On my last mac system I used iTunes for syncing some PDFs and other books to my ipad. Now on my new MBP with Mavericks and iTunes 11 there is no Books library anymore, but a new iBooks app.  I started to add some files to iBooks on my mac and followed the instructions to sync them to my ipad, but when opening iTunes and clicking the Books sync section, I still see only the old books formerly added to iTunes in the list. No new book from iBooks is being shown, so not synced to iPad.  I even don’t see a way to delete my old content (and move it to iBooks), because there is no library anymore. Just deleting the Books folder under iTunes Library didn’t work - the Books sync section still shows the old content, although the sync now complains that it can’t find the files. (Deleting Cache files didn't work here)  So how can I actually enable iBooks app content sync from Mac to iPad and get rid of my former iTunes books library?  <answer118197> I finally managed it by re-creating my iTunes library as mentioned here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1451.  After moving the code.itl/code file I also moved the codeBooks/code folder under codeiTunes Music/code.  It takes quite some time to import, depending on the size of the library, and it will finally warn that some items could not be found - which is obvious after deleting codeBooks/code.  After that the contents of iBooks appeared in the Books sync tab.  Edit: Unfortunately, all my apps for my i-devices were gone, too. I had to manually transmit them device by device via the menu item codeFile&gt;Devices&gt;Transfer Purchases from (device name)/code. This step is clearing all the apps that I haven't synched to any of the devices at this time, which might be good or bad. However, I can download them again if I'm in the need for that.
