xcode iOS simulator launcher <body> I am trying to understand the ios-sim launcher for cordova projects BR https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim/BR The two points I am trying to understand are ...  ul liWhat is launching the simulator?  ol liIs it being called as a process from the command line BR something like... /path/to/sim -- args?/li liIs it being invoked as a system library?BR something like... include systemLib/magic BR then being called as a function that launches the simulator /li /ol/li liHow is the project being "injected/installed" into the simulator?/li /ul  I have tracked down the answer as far as my understanding of Objective C can take me. BR( @ least I believe the answer to my questions is in this function )  https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim/blob/master/Source/iPhoneSimulator.m#L180  Its job is to launch the Xcode iOS simulator, at least I believe it is.   The Goal: BR Is to be able to invoke the simulator directly from command line through the shell with out the need for all these projects dependencies and to better understand the process in which Xcode uses to run the simulator.  PLEASE forgive my shorthand notations and very likely incorrect use of terminology,BR I am an Interpreted soul lost in a binary universe!  TY  <answer150375> As of Xcode 6, you can use the simctl command line tool.  Check out:  precodexcrun simctl help /code/pre  If there are any features missing, please file a radar at http://bugreport.apple.com ... this is a supported interface whereas the ios-sim utility was developed by reverse engineering private Xcode frameworks and can easily break between Xcode releases.
