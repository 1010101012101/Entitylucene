How to force open TCP 443 on my machine? <body> I turned off the firewall. Then, using strongnmap/strong in the strongterminal/strong, I issued the statement  precodenmap 127.0.0.1 /code/pre  and got  precodeStarting Nmap 7.12 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-08-15 11:00 PHT Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1) Host is up (0.00016s latency). Not shown: 968 closed ports, 27 filtered ports PORT     STATE SERVICE 22/tcp   open  ssh 80/tcp   open  http 631/tcp  open  ipp 3306/tcp open  mysql 9000/tcp open  cslistener /code/pre  How can I force open TCP 443 on my machine?  <answer249411> To force open any port you can use codenc/code (netcat).  The command codesudo nc -l 443/code will open port 443. Of course this will not serve any web pages. But it will be listed in your namp output as open port.  By specifying an interface with code-b &lt;if&gt;/code you can bind it exclusively to it - other interfaces (e.g. en1) shouldn't show an open port 443 then:  precodesudo nc -b en0 -l 443 /code/pre  Check for more options by executing codeman nc/code.  <comment309348> What process or program do you want to listen on port 443? (or how did you get port 80 open assuming you want a web server to listen on both?)
