How to use Terminal to send keystrokes? <body> Is there a way for Terminal to simulate pressing multiple keys at once? For example, Shift+Ctrl+R?   I am codessh/codeing into OS X from a Windows client (PuTTY) and am wondering if I need to configure the client or is there a native way for OS X to emulate these commands on the receiving end.  <answer136696> You can use AppleScript on the Terminal:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "r" using {control down, shift down}' /code/pre  <answer245092> the cliclick tool shell tool is pretty awesome. sends keystrokes, clicks, all sorts of stuff   https://github.com/BlueM/cliclick  <comment162248> It is about using terminal to send keyboard shortcuts. Specifically, I need to send ctrl+opt+shift+e. I need to do it without AppleScript, as it is from a Windows computer, using what I assume is some kind of Terminal simulator, or SSH from cmd. <comment162252> AppleScript works over SSH using osascript. The below answer is fully functional over SSH providing a GUI is present on the OS X machine. <comment162255> When I try that, I just get a new line with ""? <comment162265> Is it program specific? For example, if I want to type in "E" into TextEdit, would I type "osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "e" using {shift down}'"? <comment162266> Okay, I'm trying to type ctrl+opt+shift+e, and I have "osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "e" using {control down, shift down, option down}'" but it tells me "48:55: syntax error: A identifier can’t go after this “"”.
