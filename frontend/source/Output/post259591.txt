iTunes 12: How to display artwork for each song in playlist <body> In iTunes 12.5.3, I have spent emway/em too much time trying to find a way to display the artwork of each song in a Playlist, instead of the artist image (which seems to be the artwork of the first song in alphabetical order).  As you can see in the example below, the same image is used for all songs â€“ even though you can tell that there is a unique artwork for the song currently playing from the playlist.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQFPd.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Is there a setting to display unique song artwork in playlists? I have been looking in all kinds of menus, and I can't find anything!
