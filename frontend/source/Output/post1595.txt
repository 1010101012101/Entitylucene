iTunes Utility - Merging Libraries <body> I would like to merge three separate iTunes libraries.  Here is more information:  ul liCurrently have 3 separate iTunes libraries on 2 laptops and and dekstop./li liWant to merge all three onto the desktop (i.e. it has all content), while maintaining the other two laptop based libraries as-is./li liI want to avoid getting a slew of duplicates within the merged library./li liI am not concerned about maintaining the library (i.e. playlists, etc.) on desktop./li liI am not concerned with maintaining perfect sync, so could repeat the necessary procedure periodically to remerge libraries./li /ul  I am ok with using the command line, Python or applescript if that's the way to go.  <answer1598> Try this,  http://www.mediarover.com/  Haven't tried it myself yet but looks like it will give you exactly what you need.  EDIT:  Script Method: http://guides.macrumors.com/Keeping_2_iTunes_Libraries_in_Sync  I actually use this technique myself.  Creates a "carbon copy" of a library on another machine which you can then sync to reflect changes.  Works best with two Macs, never tried it with a PC.   <comment1914> Ok - thanks.  I'll give it a try, but if there are any script type recipes out there that's be great too. <comment2233> Updated question with script method! <comment2242> where were you when I asked my question about syncing itunes libraries (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1045/how-can-i-sync-my-itunes-music-library-between-two-computers-for-free)?  that link is great :P
