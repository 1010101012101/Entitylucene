Is it possible to maximize a Finder window without third-party software? <body> How can I maximize a window in Finder without using third-party software? I read this post but none of these tricks seemed to work.   <answer21006> I bought Moom by Many Tricks to solve the Finder's inconsistent zoom behavior. Get it from their website for a free trial and 60-day money-back guarantee. It's been a great solution for me, not just for the Finder problem, but for all my work on a 30-inch Cinema Display.  <answer25744> ol liLaunch code/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor.app/code and turn on the preference: General » "Show Script menu in menu bar"/li liIn Terminal, type or copy/paste  mkdir -p ~/Library/Scripts/Finder  cd ~/Library/Scripts/Finder  curl --remote-name http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18414/ase/MaximizeWindow.scpt/li liGo to Finder, open a new (non maximized) window/li liIn the menu bar, look for the the "Scripts" item, then look for Finder, and then MaximizeWindow/li /ol  img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110923-sn1ix1gi8xa62qmys4pm1a47w.jpg" alt=""  Select that, and Voilà!  p.s. - please note that I am not the original author of that AppleScript. I found it at http://olivierfabre.com/shortcut-to-maximize-the-finder-with-applescript and simply tested it and found it worked really well. It appears to be designed with hard-coded values for the screen-size, but if it can't make the window that big, it simply maximizes it.  p.p.s. - the scripts menu isn't all that convenient, but there are ways to assign keyboard shortcuts to them, etc. If you were not averse to 3rd party solutions, I would immediately recommend FastScripts and mention that it is free for up to 10 scripts :-)  <comment22989> Many of those tricks are third-party appellations which would work fine. What problem did you have? <comment23004> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x <comment23035> It's on the App Store as well, no trial of course. BTW, I personally think Moom is the best of it's genre. You should make it the first one you check out. <comment23038> Buy Witch ( http://manytricks.com/witch/ ) while you're there. It finally makes Alt+Tab work properly. <comment23068> Thanks, I was looking for native solution, not a third-party.. <comment23069> So there is no way doing this without a third-party application? <comment29071> Don't think so, but Moom is really, really good. One of those apps that should just be integrated into the OS. <comment29210> This question is asking for a solution without third-party software. <comment62926> The first two links are both broken. Anyway, I posted a similar AppleScript to [How would I make a keyboard shortcut to \*maximize\* the current window?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46233/how-would-i-make-a-keyboard-shortcut-to-maximize-the-current-window). <comment275448> The links do not work, please update.
