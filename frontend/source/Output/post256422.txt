Where is "Create disk image" function in El Capitan/Sierra? <body> Updated today to Sierra from Yosemite. Can't find disk backup function in new Disk Utility...  <answer256423> In Disk Utility, you can use "New Image from Folder" accessible under codeFile &gt; New Image &gt; Image from Folder/code or by kbdCmd ⌘/kbdkbdShift ⇧/kbdkbdN/kbd.  Navigate to Computer or Volumes in the window and select your disk as the folder to create the image from. This should create an image of the disk.  <comment319808> In El Capitan it is located under **File  New Image** <comment321165> That's it, but doesn't work with hard drives xD - error 5.
