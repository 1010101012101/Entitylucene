How can I use a secondary axis in Numbers? <body> One of my main problems with Numbers is the fact that it has much less of the functionality of Excel. That's why I barely use Numbers.  One of the main things that I always thought impossible was plotting two axes on one graph. This is my main reason for my dislike of Numbers.  Now that many other interesting questions that I didn't think had answers are getting answered, I thought I might ask this question:  How can I plot two lines on one graph using a secondary axis in Numbers?  <answer126311> If you want a line graph with 2 y-axes. You to insert-Chart- 2-Axis. Put in your data. One of the sets will be a line the others a bar. The way to fix that is: Select the one that is a bar then to go to the Inspector- Chart- Series. It will say series type- select that and change it from bar to line. Right below that it says plot on: There you can determine if you want that line to be plotted on y(1) or y(2).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cVDaZ.png" alt="What it looks like at first for 2-axis"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qpOS5.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aw7pO.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8zlqG.png" alt=""  <answer187163> Was able to do the same thing in Numbers 2009 (v2.1), but had to fiddle a lot. Use the 2-axis format. The program resists you all the way.  Here is a 2-axis graph (climate diagram) created using Numbers 2.1:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0via.png" width="450" title="Climate diagram created using numbers"  <answer282136> Yes codeNumbers/code does now supports two axes. Steps are:  ol liSelect the chart, change the type to strong2D 2-Axis/strong/li liMake sure you have more than one data series selected./li liThe strongSeries/strong tab for each data series will allow you select which axis to use for each series and the type: columns, lines or areas./li liThe chart strongAxis/strong tab contains (Y1) and (Y2) tabs which you can customise./li /ol  If you are familiar with customising graphs in codeNumbers/code - it isn't complicated.  <comment161797> "2D 2-Axis" is the chart type in Numbers 3.2. <comment161798> I think the accepted answer for this should now be changed as this is now possible. <comment161830> Yes, a welcome improvement in Number 3 from Numbers 2! <comment221170> Could you perhaps expand your answer with specific instructions as to how the graph in the screenshot was created?
