Is it possible to customize multi-touch gestures on an iPad? <body> The iPad has multi-touch gestures:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tn8V.jpg" alt="iPad multi-touch gestures"  Is it possible to customize these gestures? If so, how?  <answer36823> Not out of the box - the closest you could get some gestures is to jailbreak and install Activator which allows you to e.g. customize pinch and spread actions, slide from left/right/bottom/top of screen and then assign and action e.g. launch an app, lock the screen etc.  <answer46736> Zephyr (video demo) allows you to customize multi-touch gestures on emboth/em on any jailbroken iOS device. It allows you to have much more control over gestures than Activator.  <answer46748> If you're talking about customizing the way you invoke these gestures, I think your only option (without jail-breaking) is to make it so that instead of having to perform these gestures, you tap a few buttons. Apple calls this feature AssistiveTouch.  For example, if you want to exit an app by using AssistiveTouch rather than performing the normal gesture, do both of the following:  To create a new gesture (do this one time for each gesture):  ol liLaunch Settings/li liGo to General/li liTemporarily disable the multi-tasking gestures (this will make it easier to record the gesture)/li liNavigate to Accessibility  Assistive Touch/li liEnable it on the top/li liCreate a new gesture/li liPerform the close app gesture (start with four fingers spread out, and then slide all four fingers towards the center)./li liPress Save on the top right, and name it something like Close App./li liRe-enable multi-tasking gestures (Settings  General)/li /ol  To use the gesture:  ol liMake sure you are in an app and not looking at the home screen./li liTap the new transparent button which appears on the bottom right./li liTap Favorites  Close App./li liTap in the center of the screen/li liYou should now see your home screen instead of the original app you were in./li /ol  It's not that practical, since you end up having to tap 4 buttons instead of performing a single four-finger gesture, but it's an option in case anyone needs it.  Tip: if you don't want the AssistiveTouch button always visible, in the Accessibility page, you can set it to appear and disappear by triple-tapping the home button.  <comment53483> I really wish there was a way to make the gestures 5-finger only.
