Yosemite Problems - Mac OS X Base System <body> I am trying to clean install Yosemite, not using a bootable usb. Instead, I want to upgrade to Yosemite from Mavericks, then erase my Macintosh HD (I will leave my bootcamp) from recovery mode then install Yosemite.    HOWEVER, every time I erase my Macintosh HD, the Mac OS X Base System disk 1 only asks me to install Lion!? I don't know why Lion is my base system recovery, since I have Mavericks and then when I upgrade, technically I should have Yosemite, since recovery (not internet recovery) works off of most recent OS, which is Yosemite.  Does anyone know why Lion is my base system recovery partition and not Yosemite?  I tried clean installing Yosemite using a bootable drive, however it did not work for me twice using a USB.
