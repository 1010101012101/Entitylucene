Disable StrictHostKeyChecking in ssh <body> I am trying to connect to a Linux host using codessh/code and get the following error  precodeRSA host key for 10.1.1.20 has changed and you have requested strict checking. /code/pre  I would like to override this, but can't seem to find any combination of options to do this.  I probably set StrictHostKeyChecking years ago, but don't remember how.  I consulted codeman ssh/code which informs me the system-wide configuration file is code/etc/ssh/ssh_config/code and default for the per-user configuration file is code~/.ssh/config/code neither exists.  EDIT To clarify my question, the option is clearly set. I am trying to discover  ol liWhere the options are stored (I don't have the files mentioned in the man page, which appears to be wrong)./li liHow to change the options./li /ol  I am not looking at how to work around the issue I am having (I know I can edit the known_hosts file, but this is tedious every time I try a new server).  <answer204420> You can simply try it as it is without confitguration, just on commandline:   precodessh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no hostname /code/pre  But I don't think it does all you need. If you want to ignore all hostkey checking, you need to set up you codeknown_hosts/code file to code/dev/null/code so there will never be anything stored:  precodessh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null hostname /code/pre  or in code/etc/ssh_config/code:  precodeStrictHostKeyChecking no UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null /code/pre  <answer204421> To disable strict host checking on OS X for the current user, create or edit ~/.ssh/config and add the following lines:  precodeHost [IP Address]     StrictHostKeyChecking no    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null /code/pre  A typical example for the hosts in your local network could be:  precodeHost 10.1.1.*    StrictHostKeyChecking no    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null /code/pre  Depending on your usage of ssh I don't recommend to disable strict host key checking for strongall/strong hosts.  If you just want to remove the entry for 10.1.1.20 open ~/.ssh/known_hosts with an editor of your choice and remove the respective line "10.1.1.20 ssh-rsa empublic-key$/em"  <comment246378> It's `/etc/ssh_config` on mine. <comment246379> @sborsky I have this too (which is different from the man) but all options are commented out. <comment246380> This means default, which according to the man page is `ask`. When a host key changed, ssh client won't connect unless `StrictHostKeyChecking` is set to `no`. If the host key doesn't change very often, I'd suggest to remove this one host key from your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` instead of changing the config. <comment246410> First you must figure out **why** it was changed. If you didn't change it, then it may be a MitM attack, and then you of course should not allow this host key! <comment247291> The 1st still didn't allow me to connect, but `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null hostname` did. I still can't find WHERE StrictHostKeyChecking is set! <comment247292> It defaults to "yes" so it doesn't have to be set anywhere to apply. <comment247295> The documentation states it defaults to yes <comment247546> choosing as a solution would help if it helped to solve your problem ;) <comment282571> Also seems to work without the /dev/null line.
