Fake.app: How to loop thru the rows in a CSV file and use the data in my Workflow? <body> I am using Fake to automate some web tasks.  I have a CSV file on disk that contains rows of data which I'd like to use to fill out forms in my Fake Workflow.  How can I iterate thru the rows in the CSV file and access the values found in each column in my Fake Workflow?  <answer52237> The best approach is to use the strongRepeat With/strong Action with the stronglines in file/strong option selected. This allows you to read the CVS file on disk and iterate thru the rows as strongFake Variables/strong. You can then access these Fake Variables in other Actions which can fill out the web form (or whatever you need).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4tJrj.png" alt="enter image description here"  As seen in the screenshot above, I'm using a strongDo JavaScript/strong action to initially fetch the current codeline/code Variable and then split it into an array of comma separated values.  precodevar line = fake.get('line'); /code/pre  Then I use Fake's JavaScript API to set individual variables for each column:  precodevar row = line.split(','); fake.set('first', row[0]); fake.set('last', row[1]); /code/pre  Then use other Fake Actions to work with the data you've fetched. In this case, I'll fill out a simple web form using the strongSet Value of HTML Element/strong Action. In this Action's text fields you can access Fake Variables with this special syntax:  precode${first} /code/pre
