Gmail-like keyboard shortcuts in Mail.app (keys without modifiers) <body> How can I create keyboard shortcuts in Mail.app that do not require modifiers?  For example, I'd like j/k to scroll the message pane.  Maybe n/p to navigate between messages.    Maybe N/P to navigate to unread messages.  Maybe a to archve a message.  The key point here is that the shortcuts should not require modifiers: No Command, no Ctrl, no Option.  The gmail shortcuts are different, but similar in that they don't require modifiers.  <answer108800> I've accomplished this with Keyboard Maestro. I've setup the navigation keys, then activate and deactivate them with codeEscape/code.  Setup a group scoped to codeApple Mail/code that is activated via codeEscape/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kuyJv.png" alt="Apple Mail group"  Delete Gmail style:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ejZqH.png" alt="Delete Gmail style"  Move down:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e2Dmv.png" alt="Move down"  Move up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mw9Mf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Create a shortcut for archiving. You could use codee/code when codeEscape/code is activated to simulate Gmail's shortcut, but I prefer this as it doesn't matter what mode I am in:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ucAJv.png" alt="Archive shortcut"  You will need to bind a key to codeArchive/code in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kQqrv.png" alt="Bind key to &lt;code&gt;Archive&lt;/code&gt; in System Preferences"  Confirm in Apple Mail:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNysr.png" alt="Confirm keyboard shortcut"  Use your imagination!  <answer144117> Try GMailinator. It's free and doesn't require configuration or start any extra process. GMailinator may not as flexible as keyboard macro software while if you're looking for exactly emgmail shortcuts/em, it's a good fit.     BTW, if you don't have Xcode to build from source code, the compiled binary could be found at release tab.    <answer208087> The link provided above has stopped updating. this guy has forked and updated for the newest Mail.app (comes with El Capitan) ankushg/GMailinator. You need to build from source code, unfortunately, but if you are geeky enough to use Gmail shortcuts, I believe this is easy.  <comment60992> I doubt this is possible. <comment66047> Man, I want this too... <comment89681> I wonder if there is something like AutoHotKey for OSX.  There is an AutoHotKey script that adds Gmail shortcuts to MS Outlook.  Since all the actions are already available from the keyboard, just remapping the keys would do nicely.  No, KeyRemap4MacBook doesn't do it (as far as I know), because it doesn't know which widget is in focus in Mail.  (And I do want to be able to enter j and k into the Search field, say.) <comment132804> Could you maybe add a screenshot or a walkthrough on how to do this? This would greatly improve your answer. <comment155531> @BartArondson, I have improved my answer. Thank you for the prompt. <comment169789> Can you please tell us why it is good and not just provide a link <comment178953> This is fantastic.  Exactly what I was looking for. <comment275698> GMailinator sadly hasn't been updated since 2014 and no longer works with Apple Mail <comment275699> Can confirm this works, but you do need to build from source (the included bundle does not work with Mail 9.2) <comment364231> @lipsum123483 Thanks just came across this as I'm experimenting returning to Mail.app from Mailmate. This still works great. One variant: you don't need to create a keyboard shortcut for Archive (actually there's now one out of the box), but KM can just execute the action "select a menu item".
