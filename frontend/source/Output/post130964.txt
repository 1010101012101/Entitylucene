Turn off 4g on iphone 4s <body> Is there a way to turn off the 4g so I can use 3g on my iphone 4s? I am going to be in a area that has very poor 4g and decent 3g. I am using ios 7. Unfortunately the toggle to turn off 4g in settings, cellular is missing.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXfvh.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Xerw.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I8rJs.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GvnJO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer130974> No, you cannot do this. I understand it would help a lot in your case. There might be a jailbreak-tweak, but since my iPhone isn't jailbroken I cannot give you the right repo or even tweakname.  The carrier has updated your 3G switch to a 4G switch when they started to support 4G.  <comment153706> I don't think that I understand your problem/question. To my knowledge the 4S does not support 4G/LTE ?? <comment153708> AT&T calls their HSPA+ network 4G http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-4s-att-4g-2012-3
