Is it possible to resize a bootcamp partition to create a second drive in windows? <body> I have my Mac setup with a 500 GB bootcamp partition and I need to split that partition into 2- 250GB partitions that windows will use (one for C: and one for D:).  I already have windows installed and don't really want to wipe windows off and start over.  Can I use something like Partition Magic to change the windows partition and split it in two?  <comment328428> Never muck with repartitioning the disk from Windows on a Mac unless Windows is the only thing installed on it! If you have OS X/macOS installed and you repartition the disk from Windows it will cause issues that may or may not be able to be fixed. There are plenty of posts here on AD where a user repartition the disk from Windows and the issues it causes, so I'm not going to go into detail. <comment330141> So,  I can't change the partition from windows,  but can I change it from the Mac side and create unused space for windows to use?
