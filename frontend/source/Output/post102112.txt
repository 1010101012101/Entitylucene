The server quit without updating PID file (/usr/local/var/mysql/NAME.pid) <body> I have installed mysql via brew. First start works, but after reboot, I got the following error:  precodeThe server quit without updating PID file (/usr/local/var/mysql/NAME.pid) /code/pre  I start mysql with  precodesudo mysql.server restart /code/pre  If I try to create a pid file on my own via terminal it will created, but after a few seconds it disappear.  precodesudo touch /usr/local/var/mysql/NAME.pid /code/pre  Have anyone a idea?  <answer102117> YES.  Following homebrew caveats, did you setup launchd?  precodeTo have launchd start mysql at login:     ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents Then to load mysql now:     launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist /code/pre  Well, now using strongcodemysql.server/code/strong is pointless. It basically doesn't work, because (from my poor understanding) strongmysqld/strong is now managed by stronglaunchd/strong, and it is codemysqld_safe/code. I don't know if actually because of that is different from what you control with codemysql.server/code.  The solution I came up with is to strongnot use/strong launchd for mysql from brew. Rather, I just use the  codemysql.server/code tool to start, stop, and restart mysql.  If you want to follow my steps, this is what you need to do:  precodelaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist /code/pre  And whenever you want to start the mysql server, use codemysql.server start/code.  If you actually want to make mysql start at boot time, you can take that plist and copy it, delete the KeepAlice line, replace the string values under codeProgramArguments/code with code/usr/local/bin/mysql.server/code and codestart/code. After that dobr codelaunchctl load ~/path/to/com.file.plist/code  <answer110417> try this :     sudo mysqld_safe &amp;   <answer168755> sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/mysql/ worked for me as file permission was not there  <answer183181> Not sure why, but deleting a file called something like code/usr/local/var/mysql/Andrejs-MacBook-Pro.local.err/code and running codemysql.server start/code worked for me.  As detailed here.  <answer200098> What worked for me was codesudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/mysql//code , I've had installed from brew.  <answer205088> This is what I had to do (installed from brew):  precodesudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/var/mysql/ /code/pre  <answer210157> For conventional installations, without brew, like mine, the solutions above doesn't worked. The solution came with the permission repair, using the Utilities Disk App from OS X. Just run the app on your disk, restart, and try again. Only solution that worked here.  <answer248874> just run codemysqld/code (don't run as root) from your terminal, you're mysql server will restarts and resets everything like show in the picture:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yWTWp.png" alt="enter image description here"  and use:  precodemysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 /code/pre  <answer283319> I had faced the same issue and by following these steps solved it successfully.   Find the file code/usr/local/var/mysql/your_computer_name.local.err/code to understand more about the error.  It's probably a problem with permissions:  ol liFind if mysql is running and kill it  precodeps -ef | grep mysql kill -9 PID /code/pre  where PID is second column value/li liCheck ownership of mysql  precodels -laF /usr/local/var/mysql/ /code/pre/li liIf it is owned by root, change it to mysql or your user name  precodesudo chown -R mysql /usr/local/var/mysql/ /code/pre/li /ol  <comment286838> thanks worked for me. I am wondering why this permission was not there to begin with. <comment357221> For what it's worth, I don't use `mysql.server` anymore, instead I use `brew services` which in turn managed `launchd`.
