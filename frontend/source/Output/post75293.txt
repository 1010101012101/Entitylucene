How to see how much music do I have in iTunes? <body> The new iTunes version has brought some changes. And I just realized that it won't show anymore how much music do I have.  It used to say the size and the total play time at the bottom of the window, but it's gone now. Can I ripristinate the indicator? Or what's the easiest way to check my music library size?  <answer75294> You can bring back those details at the bottom of the screen by clicking strongShow Status Bar/strong in the strongView/strong menu, or pressing kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbd//kbd.  <answer250231> Go to Settings, then General, then About and it should list how many songs, videos, photos etc. that you have.
