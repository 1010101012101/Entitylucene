Can Scrivener 2 import a TeX file? <body> I've found the way to publish a TeX document with Scrivener 2.  Now I'm curious that whether Scrivener 2 has a capability of importing a LaTeX file and establishing a strongemScrivener style/em/strong document structure or not.  I'm asking it because I'm writing a paper with other people who are not using Scrivener.  <answer100620> Scrivener 2 does import LaTeX files as RTF (see dialog box below).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rIb4t.png" alt="enter image description here"  I imported a sample LaTeX file into a Scrivener project, and the result was test-latex.scriv. See below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ylivr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment118342> I would be surprised if it could but why don't you hop over to http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php to download the free trial and try yourself?
