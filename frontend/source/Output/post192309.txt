Making a Damaged USB Writable for Drive Genius? <body> Apologies for being (sort of) a repost from Unable to be Repaired &amp; Further Problems but I had some further questions and I was worried they wouldn't be answered.  I followed Froggard's advice and inputted the commands to terminal in order to make my damaged partition, MISC, writable, and this is what it gave back. Currently, Drive Genius 3 still says the same thing it said before, which is that it can't repair the partition because it is locked and not writable.  Is this what it should be giving back? My end-goal is to get it writable so Drive Genius 3 can repair it. (On a side-note, does anyone know if this is what I should be doing? Would Drive Genius be able to repair the problem?)   Lastly, I'm not sure if this will impact what I should do, but I once opened this partition in Bootcamped Windows 8 to see if I could read it. It seems I could not, and then Windows 8 started formatting it. I cancelled that, but according to Terminal, it's now a Windows_NTFS partition. However, according to Disk Utility, it's still an exFAT partition, which is how I originally formatted it.  Thanks for the help.  <comment228730> Don't try to repair it, try to recover it to a new drive - otherwise every step you take that doesn't work increases the damage still further <comment228733> Are you sure this is the only way? Froggard's method sounds plausible, but if everything fails I will do it this way <comment228738> hammering at a damaged or possibly failing drive is never going to make things better - recover or attempt to clone to a new drive is by far the safest. Quality triangle - all things are cheap, fast or goodâ€¦ you cannot have all three
