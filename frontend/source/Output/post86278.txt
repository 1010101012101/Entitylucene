SSH command has no -Z option - Obfuscated ssh client <body> I am working on a project remotely, and I have MACOSX 10.7.4 installed. The server is Ubuntu linux based, and I use "ssh" to access it. Recently the openSSH server in the remote server being secured by obfuscated ssh, so I have to login it with enhanced ssh command, in Windows, it's Potty software to support it. In Ubuntu Linux, it has "ssh" command with "-Z" option.  I found there is no -Z option in the "ssh" command of MacOS, so I upgrade openSSH to the latest one (6.01p1), still no this option. I am wondering why in Ubuntu linux, it's also openSSH package, but do have "-Z" option, but for the same package in MacOS, there is no "-Z" option at all?  By the way, "-Z" option will enable "ssh" to use obfuscated data (TCP header) communication. Any help is appreciated, I need a ssh client which can do support obfuscated communication.

You can download obfuscated-openssh and compile it in MacOS to get a new ssh command.  Download it from https://github.com/brl/obfuscated-openssh.  Download and install gcc - http://www.mkyong.com/mac/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-mac-os-x/  precode$ ./configure $ make /code/pre  If there are some errors while compiling it, remember to check this  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2546848?start=0&amp;tstart=0 (see details below)  precode$ export LDFLAGS="-L. -Lopenbsd-compat/ -fstack-protector-all -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 -lresolv" $ ./configure $ make /code/pre  All done, you will have a new ssh.

I have 10.8.3 and have OpenSSH_5.9p1. <comment99582> Hi what kind of information you want to know? <comment99584> When you use ssh, the communication between client and server is encrypted, but the TCP header is not, obfuscated ssh is a way to encrypt the header, so make it more secure. <comment99585> https://github.com/brl/obfuscated-openssh <comment99621> You are not really installing gcc but the Xcode command line tools - better to say that <comment99690> You definitely prefer create formulare for home brew or Portfile for MacPorts <comment177404> What about heartbleed? Is there a version of obfuscated-ssh without this flaw?
