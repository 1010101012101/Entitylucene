Syncing a music directory with a device when the device doesn't have enough space <body> In my library I have a directory with several inteligent and fixed playlist, which I want to sync my device. The problem is that the size of the directory is too big for my device, but since I can't create a playlist of a playlist to limit the size of the directory, or limit the size of the directory itself, I'm trying to find a way to convince iTunes to fill the device with tracks of the playlist until the device is full, without throwing me several warnings. Is there a way?  <answer200658> When you create a smart playlist, emyou can/em select another playlist or folder as source, there you can personalize how would the selection of songs be done, etc.
