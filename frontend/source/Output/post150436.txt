OpenGL rendering in MatLab 2014b <body> I have recently updated my MacBook Pro to OSX 10.9.5 and Xcode to 6.0.1 in an effort to take advantage of the new MATLAB 2014b graphics rendering under OpenGL 4.1. I understand that there seems to be two (2) versions available under OSX, "Legacy" and "Core", and both are hardware driven so setting "OpenGl software" in MATLAB is a no-go. The legacy version is locked in at 2.1 but the core should be 3+. How do I go about setting the OpenGL driver to run core either a) all the time or b) when MATLAB is running?  I have tried contacting both Mathworks and Apple to no avail.  Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.
