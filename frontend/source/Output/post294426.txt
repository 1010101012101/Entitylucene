OpenVPN issue on OSX Sierra <body> I was using OpenVPN to connect, but it seems the latest upgrade to macOS version 10.12.6 has farked my ability to connect. I am getting the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/McaMG.png" alt="enter image description here"  I know it is not an error with the OpenVPN server, because I can connect fine from a Windows machine.  <comment371625> https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?t=22733 ??
