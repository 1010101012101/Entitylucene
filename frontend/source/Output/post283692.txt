Safari cannot connect to web sites through Ethernet or Wi-Fi! <body> I have an early 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra version 10.12.4. All of a sudden I cannot connect to the Internet at all - with a full Wi-Fi signal or by Ethernet. Sometimes the page says, Cannot connect to the Server" other times the page will look like it's trying to load and then just freezes.  It's not the connection, as other people in my office are connected with other computers and have no issues. I've also tried connecting to my phone as a personal hotspot - didn't work either. Interestingly enough, iTunes does work - I can connect and play my music without a problem. Someone please help - I have no clue what happened!!  Ifconfig en0 and iconfig en1 output both show the IP address and an active status.   <comment357692> What is the output of `ifconfig en0` and `ifconfig en1`.  Please post the output by **editing the original question.** <comment357695> I'm not sure what that means, but I put it into Spotlight and added in original post. <comment357696> Sorry...issue those commands in **Terminal** <comment357705> Please post the **output** itself.  We need to know the IP address <comment357773> Problem solved - someone had changed the network settings at my office, apparently it didn't affect the PC's only my Mac. Thank you!!
