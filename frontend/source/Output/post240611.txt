Ctrl+D toggles the OSX dock but I want it to be passed to the terminal <body> I'm new to Linux and have been playing around with manipulating files with cat  ie.   precodecat &gt; randomNames Albert Einstein Marie Curie Isaac Newton /code/pre  now when I want to quit cat with codecontrol + D/code on my mac it just seems to toggle my dock?!  To no avail I've tried all options; what could be happening here?  <comment295781> @Babyy - thank you. Truth be told I had written in a similar style to your edit  - not sure why it displayed the way it did :/ <comment295782> It's possible that dock captured `Ctrl-D` combination, or you pressing not a `Ctrl` key but some other Mac key. <comment295783> Agreed, @Seo-Jun Koh - Make sure you are using the `Ctrl` key, not the `Cmd` key. Mac has almost replaced `Ctrl` with `Cmd`, except for in the terminal (and a few other application-specific examples)... <comment295784> 100% holding down control + d (does the lower case matter cause it's a lower case d) otherwise I would have to capslock (or shift + control + D) ...when I do command and D it just splits the terminal window into parts - really weird. I asked my prof and he was befuddled. :/ Sorry I know this question is lame ...
