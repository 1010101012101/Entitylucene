What are all these question marks for? <body> I have encountered a strange Finder bug/unexplained issue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tagu5.png" alt="Question marks?"  There are just question marks all over it. When you click on them, the pop up box that appears says something like "This item cannot be found." Additionally, when clicking the  button on the right, a menu of 5 blank entries appears, and they do not respond to mouse clicks.  What could this possibly be?  <comment347207> You can place shortcuts to files, folders or applications on the Finder toolbar, by Cmd-dragging them onto it. When a shortcut gets broken for some reason, Finder shows a question mark icon. You can Cmd-drag each broken icon off the toolbar to get rid of it.
