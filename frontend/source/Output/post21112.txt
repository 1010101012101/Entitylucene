In Lion, how can I configure to not automatically re-open recent files that weren't closed? <body> For example: I opened some files in Excel, then I close Excel, without close each file (ex.: command + Q). In the next time that I will open Excel, it is going to open my recent files that weren't closed.  Is there someway that I can change this behaviour?   P.S.: This occurs with other apps too, for example "Preview".  <answer21115> System Preferences  General  Uncheck the Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDFV5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You can also toggle this behavior by holding the kbdoption/kbd key when quitting an application.  Added - October 19, 2012  In Mountain Lion, this option has been changed to read, "Close windows when quitting an application" with fine print to explain that open documents will not be restored.  <answer21116> If you're running Lion, this is a built-in feature called Resume.  To prevent apps like Preview/TextEdit/other apps that support Resume from "resuming", quit them with kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdQ/kbd.  <answer32583> You can disable the resume feature on a per-app basis as well. See the section titled "strongStop Preview (or Other Apps) from Restoring Windows/strong" at http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_tame_six_os_x_lion%E2%80%99s_early_problems  According to the article's author, the command line (to be executed in Terminal.app) to disable the resume functionality only for Preview is  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -int 0 /code/pre  <comment23146> Does this work for third party things that haven't been updated for Lion, too? If so, awesome. <comment23147> Resume applies to third party apps as well. Apps don't need to explicitly support it. <comment23148> Yes, it works with third party apps too. I can't find official confirmation but I can confirm that Excel and other non-Lion updated apps still benefit. <comment23150> Thanks a lot Nate! I tested with Excel and Preview in Lion and worked. :D <comment23184> If it answers your question you can mark the answer correct by clicking the checkmark. :-) <comment23257> Thanks, Nate. I've updated my answer to reflect. <comment254032> Unfortunately this doesn't work for Preview in Yosemite, and the MacLife page and site are gone. How rapidly information becomes stale!
