How to remove passpoint wifi network on iphone? <body> I'm having this issue on my iPhone where it connects automatically to a certain network (Orange Mobile WIFI). These things are all around town but they do not work at all. The thing is that I can't even remove the network because there is no "forget this network" button. Has anyone else had this issue and how can I permanently remove the network? (iOS 9.3.3, jailbroken)   <answer295996> My iPhone was trying to connect to TWC Wifi Passpoint after I deleted the Time Warner app. Even when I adjusted my wifi setting, it persisted. I resolved the issue by going into the General Settings where I found a profile for TWC, which I deleted.   <comment342825> If you tap the "i" button near the network name, is there a switch that says "auto-join"? <comment342831> Do you have any other wifi networks saved on your iPhone? <comment342991> You should have a button on top after tapping the 'i' besides the network name saying 'Ignore network'. That should solve the problem.
