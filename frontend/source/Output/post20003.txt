How can I see in iTunes how much time is left in audio books and podcasts? <body> When listening to audio books and podcasts iTunes and iPods/iPhones remember the last position.  How can I see this piece of information in iTunes without playing the podcast? (It is displayed on my iPhone as "xx minutes left" in the list of podcasts.)  <answer20009> In iTunes, when a podcast is playing, you can click the top bar where it says how long the podcast is. Clicking that will change the total time into the time remaining.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3b0ad.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment22133> Okay, that's right. But how can I do it without playing the podcast? (I'll edit the question accordingly.)
