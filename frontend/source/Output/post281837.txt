How can I copy a PDF from OneDrive to iBooks using the OneDrive iPhone app? <body> I have a PDF file in OneDrive that I would like to copy to iBooks on my iPhone. Usually apps have an option to copy the PDF to iBooks, but apparently the OneDrive app doesn't. I tried pressing the button on the top right corner after opening the PDF in the OneDrive app and then selecting "Share a link", but it doesn't seem like the iBooks option is available there:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9AKPV.png" alt="enter image description here"  I clicked on More to see if there was an iBooks option that was hidden, but no.  I also tried Open in another app, but nothing happened. The other options in that menu (delete, rename, etc) don't seem to have anything to do with what I want to do.  I also tried opening the PDF online on OneDrive's website with Safari, since Safari usually has an option to copy PDF files to iBooks, but that didn't open it as a PDF file but as a webpage, so copying it to iBooks that way created a screenshot in iBooks and not the actual PDF.  The only solution that I found was sending the PDF to myself by email and copying it to iBooks through the Gmail app, but I would like to know if there is a better way to do.  Is there an easy way to export a PDF from OneDrive to iBooks on an iPhone, preferably directly from the OneDrive app?  <answer281840> Try downloading the PDF, there should be an option called "Open with ..." or "Open in iBooks".  Or after selecting it, click on the 3 dots on the top right, there should be the option "Open in"  <comment354730> As I said in my question, I tried clicking on the three dots on the top right and clicking on Open in another app, but nothing happened <comment354979> I find it strange, in every cloud service there is the download function and then you can open it in Ibooks. Also downloading from Safari and not from app
