Is reassigning or disabling short-key possible? <body> The finder has the Command-H assigned to 'hide finder'. Can I reassign the key to something else? Or can I disable the Command-H short key to hide finder only through menu?  <answer4501> Yes you can.  Open codeSystem Preferences/code, Keyboard. Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab at the top. In the left pane, select codeApplication Shortcuts/code. In the right pane, select Finder.app. Click the code+/code at the bottom of this pane. For Menu Title, type the exact wording / spelling of the menu item in question: in this case strongHide Finder/strong. For Keyboard Shortcut, pick another keystroke combination to hide the finder (I use function key F1). Voila. Now go to Finder and look at the Finder menu; beside Hide Finder should be F1 (or whatever you chose).  <answer69986> You can also assign a shortcut to something like the NUL control character by editing the property list directly.  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents '{"Hide Finder"="\0";}' /code/pre  If a shortcut was assigned to nil, it would be shown as N in System Preferences and pressing L would trigger it in some applications like Audacity.  <comment4316> Maybe this topic help you http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/808/find-and-change-system-shortcut
