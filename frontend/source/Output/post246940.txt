Run multiple instances of Telegram <body> I have 2 iphones and use 2 seperate Telegrams.  The 2nd one is assigned to me by the external project phone I'm assigned to and that company uses Telegram extensively.  There is 1000's of employees communicating in multiple groups.  There's a lot of traffic.  Current setup:  ul liMain account / OSX: Official OSX telegram.app/li liMain account / iOS: Official iOS telegram.app/li li2nd account / OSX: Official Windows app running in an VMWare XP box/li li2nd account / iOS: iOS Anyways Messenger/li /ul  For the iPhone I could live with the Anyways Messenger even though it hasn't been updated for a long time and contains a lot of bugs.  For OSX I'd really would like to be able to run 2 instances of the official Telegram app, without having to run my VMWare.  Any suggestions?  <answer293251> Telegram offers 2 official versions of their OSX app.  Version 1 is the official maintained version, both available as direct .dmg download on the Telegram website and in the Appstore.  Version 2 is also official, but it's the deprecated objective-c version, also offered as direct .dmg download.  While it's no longer supported, it does still run - and uses separate user credentials.  Newer features are not available, but otherwise it runs fine.  <comment304671> Some OSX Apps, such as "Preview", you can just duplicate in your App folder, and that'll let you run two copies simultaneously. They *will* share the same prefs file, and possibly other files as well, so some caution is needed. I don't have a copy of Telegram to test, and see how that behaves. <comment304681> I have tried all of the normal stuff before asking this question.  So while your suggestion is a very logic one it doesn't work.
