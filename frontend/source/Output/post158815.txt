Totally at a loss here.  <answer171620> I'm not sure because i knever used the option, but maybe you can try "unix extensions = yes" ( Darwin is BSD )  I also suggest to use as less params as possible, it's easyer to find what went wrong that way. These are mine and it works.  pre    [sharename]    comment = My Shared Volume    browsable = yes    read only = no    writable = yes    path = /home/dimitri    guest ok = no    create mask = 0750    directory mask = 0755    oplocks = no /pre  keep it simple if you want to avoid a comples headache  <comment201937> And thank you for downing me without testing it. Since 2000 i've been using every major distro that has been around. So you might want try my answers before voting against them. :|
