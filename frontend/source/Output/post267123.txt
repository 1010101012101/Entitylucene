open a interactive terminal window <body> How to open an interactive terminal window after executing some commands?  For example, I would like to have open a directory at a specific directory with a specific environment  strongmyscript.cmd/strong  precode#!/bin/bash cd ~/specificfolder source activate mycondaenvironment  pwd which python /code/pre  If I double click the file, a Terminal window opens, executes the script and then logs out code[Process complete]/code  If I run   precodeosascript -e 'tell app "Terminal" to do script "/path/to/myscript.cmd"' /code/pre  a Terminal window opens, executes the script and then waits for input (but forgets the directory and environment set by the script)  Finally I found to get what I want with   precodeosascript -e 'tell app "Terminal" to do script "/bin/bash --init-file  /path/to/myscript.cmd"' /code/pre  but I wonder if there is a "proper" way to do it
