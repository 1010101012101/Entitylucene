install binary file != move binary to path folder? <body> What is the difference (is there any?) between codesudo install -c -o %username% binaryfile usr/local/bin/code and just moving binary file to codeusr/local/bin/code?  <answer280742> When you use codeinstall/code, it will copy a file to it's destination, while codemv/code changes the directory listing and is atomic. When you move a file from one file system to another then codemv/code is not atomic and will copy the file to the other file system then remove the source file. Obviously, codemv/code and codeinstall/code have different options with codeinstall/code offering you more fine grain choices.  <comment353042> Read the man page for [`install`](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/install.1.html)! <comment353088> What Mac model and OS version are you doing this on?  What directory are you in when you run the command? Did you really want to install into `usr/local/bin` and not `/usr/local/bin` with the preceding `/`?  Does the directory exist on the computer? <comment353128> Could you please explain the use of the word "atomic" in your answer? <comment353274> @user3439894- atomic in the context that if the user has the proper access to the source and destination, the operation can not be interrupted. Thus the operation is guaranteed. I 'm burning in a new computer and don't have access to all the man pages yet, but I think that rename(2)  and atomic(3) contain information.
