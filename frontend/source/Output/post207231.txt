User account on iMac won't allow applications to open <body> When my friend logs into his user account and tries to open the Mail App, he just gets the spinning ball and it won't open. Safari and other apps will open, but they take forever. When his wife or kids log in under their accounts, the machine is as fast as ever.  I had him repair permissions and verify the disc. Both processes went fine, but did not help.  It's a 5 year old iMac with 4 gig of Ram running the latest version of Yosemite.  Any ideas?  <answer207245> One big change since El Capitan - strongMail is now in V3/strongbr All the rest will be the same.

Now that you've completed these steps, work with Mail a little longer. If you are still having issues, or Mail fails to launch, you should try a manual reindex.      strongStep 2: Re-index/strong      Manual reindexing of Mail messages is the only way to go if the  application has become so unresponsive it barely works at all, search is not functioning correctly or the app won't launch.
