How do I look up the Unicode # for a given character on Lion? <body> How do you find the Unicode number representation for a given character in Lion?  On Mac OS X 10.6 when hovering the mouse cursor over for example the &#8984; symbol in the "Character Viewer" a tool tip would be displayed containing something like:     Unicode: 2318      UTF8: E2 8c 98   That behavior appears to no longer work on Lion's "Character Viewer"  <answer41618> The code points should be shown in the right sidebar emif you've enabled the Unicode category from the Customize List… sheet/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CsY3C.png" alt=""  <answer41619> Right click on the character, select the one choice from the popup menu: Copy character info. Then paste somewhere. Not as easy as it used to be.  <comment47198> On Lion? Are you sure? Does not look like it on my machine. <comment47200> How did you get the Unicode to show up there?  I just see on the right side "PLACE OF INTEREST SIGN" and then immediately below it the "Add to Favorites" button. <comment47201> NOTE: I am running Mac OS X Version 10.7.0, if that helps. <comment47203> @HaraldHanche-Olsen It seems to depend on the Unicode category (which corresponds to the All Characters view on 10.6) being shown in the sidebar. <comment47206> Perfect, a right under the surface gem, even better than 10.6 now, thanks! <comment47212> Oh, I see … that is just amazingly non-intuitive.
