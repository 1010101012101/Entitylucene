iPhone 4 Stopped Charging <body> My iPhone 4 has stopped being able to be charged.  I have tried two different cords and have tried plugging it into my computer, but nothing works.  There is not an Apple Store close.  What are some things that I should try?  <answer139493> From iPhone and iPod touch: Charging the battery:     If your battery doesn't charge, or if your device shows a low-battery image, black screen, or "accessory not supported" alert, follow these steps.      ul   liInspect the connector at the bottom of the phone:   ul   liMake sure that there are no bent pins in the connector./li   liMake sure that the connector is free from debris./li   liIf there are bent pins or debris, please contact Apple Support./li   /ul/li   liOtherwise, continue troubleshooting./li   liMake sure that the outlet you're using works./li   liMake sure that the Apple USB cable and Apple USB power adapter work./li   liPlug the device in to power and let it charge until your device turns on. This could take between 10 and 30 minutes. If you don't have an Apple USB power adapter, try connecting to a computer's high-power USB 2.0 port (not a keyboard). The computer must be on./li   liIf the device still exhibits an issue, try turning your device off and then on again while connected to power./li   liIf the issue persists, please contact Apple Support./li   /ul   <answer139495> I have found from personal experience (not only my cell-phone) that debris are very often the root cause of the "not supported cable" alert.  Cleaning the female connector (on the device) always fixed the problem in these cases.  <comment164471> How are you determining that charging has stopped? Have you gone through the troubleshooting steps at support.apple.com after making sure the phone is backed up (assuming there is any power left)? <comment164472> I got the lint out.  I haven't scraped the pins off or anything.  How should I do that? <comment164474> Thanks.  Tried those things short of Apple Support.  Nothing works. <comment164477> How I am determining that charging has stopped - I have tried to charge it multiple times and with multiple cords and nothing happens.  There is no power left.  The only thing that I can get to happen at this point is that if I hold down the power button, I get the screen that indicates that I need to charge it. <comment164479> @bill999 sadly sounds like it needs a repair. Thanks for clarifying things in your comments. In the future, consider listing precisely what you did to avoid getting a general answer if you need specific advice (and vice versa) <comment164480> Thanks for the clarification of how to phrase my question. <comment164517> am not sure what you mean. Have you cleaned the device end of the connector? if you did the that would be it. <comment164536> Yes.  I'll probably have to get a new one.
