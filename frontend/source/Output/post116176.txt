What is a good App for OSX that locks your Macbook when outside "known" wifi area <body> I am looking for an app that locks my Macbook when not connected to a known wifi network. And I am the only one who can manage my known networks: I'm asked for a password to add networks to my "known list".  Who knows a good app for that?  <answer116180> You can use strongControlPlane/strong where you can set up rules based on various criteria.     ControlPlane supports multiple contexts where a context is defined as a location or activity you are performing.  Using evidence sources you can create a set of rules that tell ControlPlane what context to apply to your environment.  When ControlPlane enters or leaves a context a set of Actions are performed.   <answer116356> 1) Well, you can compare the current SSID against a list of all known Wi-Fi networks easily enough:  precode#!/bin/sh   # This may be 'en1' on computers with a built-in Ethernet port WIFI_PORT='en0'  SSID=$(/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | awk -F': ' '/ SSID/{print $NF}')  KNOWN=$(networksetup -listpreferredwirelessnetworks "${WIFI_PORT}" | egrep -v '^Preferred networks on' | sed 's#^   ##g')  echo "$KNOWN" | egrep -q "^${SSID}$"  EXIT="$?"  if [[ "$EXIT" != "0" ]] then         echo "$NAME: Unknown network!"          exit 1 fi  # EOF /code/pre  You can do whatever you want instead of codeexit 1/code to lock the computer.  You could trigger it using SleepWatcher from http://www.bernhard-baehr.de.  The problem is: then what do you do when you are on a new emfriendly/em Wi-Fi network that you want to add to your list of known networks?  2) Thereâ€™s also Sidekick which might be able to help.

Or are you hoping it will stop a thief who might lift your MacBook? <comment135934> Yes, i want to have this as a protection to my data in case of theft.
