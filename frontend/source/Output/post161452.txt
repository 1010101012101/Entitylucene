Dragon Dictate often turns the microphone on after mistakenly believing I have said "wake up" <body> In Dragon Dictate 4, the voice command em"wake up"/em can be used to turn the voice recognition on (provided that the microphone was asleep, not off). It tends to get triggered too easily: when I discuss around with colleagues as the microphone is asleep, Dragon often believes I have said "wake up", and subsequently turn the microphone on. Is there any way to avoid this situation?   <comment247826> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247827> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
