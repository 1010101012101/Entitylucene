How to minimize all other windows of an app? <body> I notice that on a Mac, if I have several windows of one application (say, Chrome) open and click the Chrome icon at the bottom, it opens all the windows simultaneously, which usually fills up the entire screen.  However, what I often want to do is have Chrome open side-by-side with another app (like Preview). As I recall, there was a shortcut key to minimize all Chrome windows except the current one - is this the case and if so, how could I do that?
