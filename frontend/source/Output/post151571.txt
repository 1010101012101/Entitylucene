What is the "Verifying XXX.app" dialog and how do I get passed it? <body> I'm trying to open a new app that I downloaded on OS X Yosemite 10.10.  Specifically, it is Android Studio.app version 0.8.13.    When I open it, I see the following dialog "Verifying Android Studio.app...":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ehldx.png" alt="enter image description here"  The progress bar has been at 100% for about 10 minutes and it hasn't gone away.  Granted, this app is rather large at about 25gb of SDK that needs to be included in the directory.  How do I get passed this dialog?  <answer151572> The answer seemed to be to move the very large SDK out of the /Applications/Android Studio.app directory, then launch Android Studio, quit Android Studio, and move the sdk directory back into the /Applications/Android Studio.app directory.  After doing that, the Android Studio app launched fine.
