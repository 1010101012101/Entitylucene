Updating to macOS Sierra from OS X 10.6.8 <body> My OS is 10.6.8.  Yosemite is no longer available in US.  But Sierra needs 10.7 to download. Help! I'm stuck in a loop!  And cannot install my new printer until this is resolved. :/  <answer263463> You need to buy 10.7 here. Upgrade your computer to 10.7 and then download Sierra and install.  EDIT: According to timothymh's answer, you can also install 10.11 for free and then update to Sierra. This is free compared to my solution.  <answer263467> You can install El Capitan from the App Store (even on 10.6.8) for free, and then update to Sierra after completion.
