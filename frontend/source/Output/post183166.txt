How do I restore icons in Finder? <body> So yesterday I tried opening one of my apps an the Dock just froze completely. I tried every tip I could find online like Command+Option+Escape and codekillall -KILL Dock/code, but nothing fixed it. I was finally forced to restart my MacBook Pro. Now, my Finder looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n5HLi.png" alt="Finder with no icons"  How do I fix Finder?  <answer183168> You can reset OS X's icon cache with the following commands. Just copy and paste each into a Terminal window and then reboot your Mac.  precode sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \;  sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \;  sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store /code/pre  Source: Clearing the Icon Services cache in Yosemite  <comment364467> Still works in Sierra...thanks!
