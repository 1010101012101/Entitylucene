What kind of different surface material is used in Magic Trackpad 2 compared to MBP late 2016? <body> I am using MBP late 2016. As the sensitivity and frictional issues came, I try Magic Trackpad 2. I feel much better than inbuilt trackpad in MBP. What kind of hardware materials are used and why MBP does not consider to use that instead of inbuilt trackpad ignoring the price?   <comment374324> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because asking how/why Apple does something is outside the scope of what can be asked as defined in the [Help Center](https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) <comment374325> The specific hardware materials is Apple trade secrets, but you can get a good idea of what they are using from this article:  https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/look-inside-the-new-retina-macbook-pros-force-touch-trackpad-and-taptic-engine/ <comment374326> @Allan yes, it seems like it's off topic, however in another way, is the material or technology used in Magic Trackpad different than MBP trackpad? Or I feel different, I have nothing to do with material unless touch and navigate.
