MacBook metallic sound from the inside of device <body> Every now and then when I'm using my 13" MacBook Pro I can hear this funny metallic sound from the inside of the device it's a kind of metallic "click" sound. What that might be?  <comment142170> Can you tell us if there are any correlations with activities you are performing when you hear the click? Usually, clicking noises are HDs beginning to fail. You don't mention how old this MacBook Pro is. If it is long in the tooth, the HD may be failing. Back it up! <comment142262> Can you record the sound? My iMac has been making click sounds like [this](http://19a5b0.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/imac.m4a) for about two months. According to a service provider the sounds come from the hard drive, but they didn't find anything wrong with the hard drive, and replacing it would be really expensive. <comment142292> @LauriRanta Thats exactly the same sound.
