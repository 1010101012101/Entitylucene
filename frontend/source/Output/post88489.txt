cannot re-enable notification center in mountain lion <body> I disabled Notification Center a while ago by running  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist /code/pre  But after enabling it back with  precodelaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist /code/pre  it didn't reappear in the Finder.  When navigating to code/System/Library/CoreServices/code in Finder I see two NotificationCenter icons (with sizes 3.9 MB and 3.3MB). Running the bigger one will start NC until the next reboot, running the smaller one does nothing.  How can I get Notification Center back?  <comment103575> Welcome to the site! Could you please add some details so people here are able to understand your problem better? Of special interest would be the commands you use to turn off/on Notification Center and (a link to) a screenshot of the Finder window with the icons you're referring to. <comment103619> For screenshots please upload them to any public site (or use Dropbox) and add the links as a comment or **an edit to the question**. Somebody with more reputation will then embed them into your question. <comment103688> Have you tried running `launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist; sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist` (and restarting)?
