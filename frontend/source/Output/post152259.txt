How can I choose by keyboard the autocorrect suggestions? <body> I love the strongapple magic trackpad/strong but, I don't like to use mouse to chose something while I'm typing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GeFF8.png" alt="autocomplete suggestion"  Is there a way, to pick the option using the keyboard?   PS: Note that sometimes it may exist more than one option to pick  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cUWqa.png" alt="autocomplete multiple suggestions"  <answer152270> When the autocorrect suggestion is showing, you need to press the DOWN key, then you can use left and right to select if there is multiple. After that hit return. No mouse/trackpad interaction required. :)   <comment179169> does pressing UP Arrow on the keyboard helps? (If suggestion appears on the bottom, try DOWN Arrow). Later You can choose words with LEFT/RIGHT Arrow. It works for me. <comment179208> Awesome! this is what I was looking for =) Thanks
