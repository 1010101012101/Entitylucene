Connect dual Monitors to a single USB-C Port <body> How can I connect dual monitors with DVI or Display Port or HDMI to my single USB-C Port on my 2016 MacBook?  <answer240400> I don't have a Macbook 2016 but you could try this (or more cheaply a third party cable that converts USB3A to DVI/DisplayPort/HDMI) connected to this connected to your Macbook.  You may want to look at the review for the second one. Apparently it has some reliability issues.  <answer240402> The 2016 Macbook doesn't support more than 1 external display.  From Everymac.com:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XqP7T.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, that being said, I have seen folks add a second screen (a second projector) using a USB to video adapter.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xWnJh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have never had the need or opportunity to try this myself, so YMMV.  <comment334351> have you found out how to connect two monitors (both HDMI/DVI) to one single USB-C port?
