My external harddisk is readonly on mac <body> I am having a 1Tb external harddisk. Its working perfectly fine on ubuntu and windows. But On mac its read-only. How can I change this.  <answer14914> Your external drive is most probably formatted on Windows and is then in NTFS format. Check this question which will give you the different possibilities you have.  <comment16056> With what filesystem is the HD formatted? NTFS? <comment16057> If the exHDD is NTFS formatted, you can use either [ntfs-3g(free)][1] or NTFS for Mac([http://www.paragon-software.com/de/home/ntfs-mac/]).
