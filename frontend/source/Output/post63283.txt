How can I use iTunes with Debian? <body> Wine fired a lot of errors at least with Ubuntu last time -- and also with Debian, below a picture. Is there any way of using iTunes with *ix -systems? Look I have iPad and I am unable to use it without iTunes -support, example problem here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vlF9I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer63294> According to the Wine AppDB, running iTunes under Wine is an adventure in itself. Success mainly depends on the specific iTunes version and it might only partially work even then.  <comment73144> This might also be cross-posted on Ask Ubuntu or even Unix/Linux.SE
