Tile 2 windows side by side by keyboard shortcuts <body> I am using codeMac OS X Lion 10.7.2/code, often I like to display 2 windows side by side, does anyone know if there is any application which makes it possible to tile windows by simple keyboard shortcuts?  <answer46135> I use Better Touch Tool to do that.  Here's an example configuration that has a keyboard shortcut for resizing to the right half and one for the left half. I also have a shortcut that quickly maximizes a window. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GopGA.png" alt="Example BTT configuration"  <comment52655> Thanks for your comment... It seems that if I log out and log in, I need to reactive BTT, do you have any solution to keep it always activated? <comment52656> Yes, in BTT, click General Settings, and then make sure "Launch BetterTouchTool on Startup" is checked. <comment52657> I see, that works... BTW, is it a product still in Beta stage? Why isn't it in Apple Store? <comment52659> See the author's blog posts about that - http://blog.boastr.net/?p=2229 and http://blog.boastr.net/?p=2698 So it's a stable app and works great, just not available in the mac app store.
