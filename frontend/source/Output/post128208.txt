imovie. Adding a static image without the gentle zooming effect <body> I'm using imove 10.0.3  When I add a static image (a jpeg file) to my movie it adds a gentle zooming effect. Very pretty but I didn't want it, and I cannot work out how to switch it off. Infuriating!  I'm trying to add the image either by dragging it onto the movie, or by clicking the [+] button which appears on the photo. Either way it adds it with a zooming effect.  Within the movie I notice I can select it, and then use an "Adjust" toolbar to achieve various things (mostly colour shifts in the image)... but I can't see any options for disabling the effect.  <answer128211> In the Adjust toolbar, click Crop, then Fit.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3uZr.png" alt=""  <answer257185> In Preferences, Photo Placement is by default set to "Ken Burns". Set it to something else and you'll avoid this annoyance.  <comment150222> Thanks! That's the correct answer. I think that must be the only button and menu option in the entire i-move interface that I didn't try :-)
