Reset license key for MS Mac Office 2011 <body> I need to enter a new MS Office for Mac license key.br How can I reset my old one?  <answer16299> From this forum post:     Ditch code/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist/code. Start any Office application. Reregister/reactivate.   Hope it helps.  <answer265343> To add to this, once you delete /Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist you then need to reboot.  The activate office screen will then come up when you open any Office app.  <answer276845> This does not work if you switch computers, Office will complain that product has been used the maximum number of times.  One has to call them to reset activations.  <comment348525> Welcome to Ask Different. Please don't add comments in the _Answer_ field as this is for answers to questions.
