OS-wide equivalent of "read later" list? <body> Is it possible to set up a shortcut so that whatever is in my clipboard goes into a specific text-file ?  The idea is to have an OS-wide inbox where I can send anything (img, pdf, text, url) quickly. Much like a generalized "read later" feature.  <answer274663> Notes would be useful for this. There's a share extension for Notes which can be used by any app and which takes the current content straight into a note for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AQ7ig.png" width="485"  Depending on the app, the extension may be in a variety of places, but for example in Safari you can go to File → Share → Notes.
