Infinite "Verifying *.pkg" <body> I have been staring the following to dialogs for about an hour:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ys76r.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJ9Fv.png" alt="enter image description here"  This problem does't only occur on one specific application. Instead, strongall/strong applications seem to experiencing an infinite verification progress. What's wrong with my computer?  In fact, this issue emerges exactly after I upgrade my system. The current system version is codeOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)/code and here is the upgrades I've just installed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UzXQX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thanks in advance.  <answer237957> Many times (not every time) this is because of a codeKeychain/code certificate/network issue.  You can try turning off codeCertificates/code and see if this helps.  After you do this, restart the MacBook, finish the installations, then turn codeCertificates/code back on.   Go to codeKeychain Access --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Certificates/code.  See the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XkFEi.png" alt="enter image description here"
