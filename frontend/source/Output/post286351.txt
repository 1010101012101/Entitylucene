Iphone Six Internet Connection Very Faulty <body> So, I have an iPhone 6. S. When I first got it and months after the internet was working flawlessly, better than any other devices in my house, specifically a laptop that I don't own. It seems like my phone and that laptop have now switched, because the internet on that laptop and all other digital things in our household are working flawlessly with instant connections all the time, but my phone now struggles to keep a connection for about 3 minutes.  ul liMy issue:/li /ul  My primary issue is that I get the internet to work for about five seconds every 30 minutes. After that 5 seconds, against the little sign saying you have internet (I have 3 rays so that must mean the maximum), I have a little loading circle that persists for five million years and never goes away.  How can I fix this?  <comment361272> The problems not the phone, the problem is your router and/or the internet connection itself. <comment361277> I doubt that because the phone is the only thing in my household which has such issues @Tyson <comment361279> And you've ensured there are no IP conflicts? <comment361280> What does that mean? I mean, we haven't bought anything electronic that could've done anything to it. It just randomly gained these connection issues. @Tyson <comment361285> That for some reason your router is handing out the same IP address to two devices. It's either a badly configured device on the network, where the device has been configured using a static address still in the DHCP pool, or it could be any of 100 router configuration problems... for example someone tried to limit or boost a specific devices bandwidth, but did it not realizing the IP address could change because its using DHCP without a reservation.   Have you rebooted the router? That's always a good start just to assure there's no trashy stuff accumulated in routing tables....
