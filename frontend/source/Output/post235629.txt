How do I stop the search helper from popping up in my browser? <body> I'm trying to select text in chrome, and half the time I get this weird popup while selecting the first word, It's really annoying and I'd like to disable it, at least in chrome.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/01SwG.png" alt="Demonstration of odd behavior"  I've never experienced this behavior before today, I'm on a newly issued rMBP at work, I haven't seen this on my personal laptop, or other OSX devices, or windows or linux for that matter.  I'm just not even sure where to start in terms of disabling this.  <answer235630> Finally found it, it appears to be part of the codeTrackpad Settings/code regarding codeLook up and data detectors/code ... I changed the setting from codeForce click with one finger/code to codetap with three fingers/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/obfEL.jpg" alt="related setting"
