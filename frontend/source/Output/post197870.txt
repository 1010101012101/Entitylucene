Restore Safari browser on MacBook Air Yosemite OSX 10.10.4 <body> How do I restore my Safari browser.  I accidentally deleted it. Now I have to use Google or Bing.  Whoops!  <answer197883> Many who are new to the Mac and OS X mistakenly think they have deleted something if they accidentally or purposely remove a icon from the strongDock/strong.  If that is what you have done, restoring it to the strongDock/strong is easily done.  ul liFind your strongApplications/strong folder/li liLocate strongSafari/strong/li liDrag to the dock/li /ul  Or, double click on it and it will open.  There you can pin it to the strongDock/strong. By long pressing the icon or right clicking and select options.  See screenshot below.  The other way to keep it there is simply to drag it to a new location on the strongDock/strong closer to the strongFinder/strong icon.  If you dragged it to the strongTrash/strong from the Applications folder, the open the trash folder by double clicking on it and restoring from there.  If you strongemtruly/em/strong deleted it, which is very hard to do "accidentally", a restore of your OS may be in order.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PcQUj.png" alt="Pin to dock"  <comment236603> The only way I know is to use OS X restore with "cmd+r" that will restore the installation, since the Safari is integrated part of it. <comment236612> How did you "_accidentally_" delete it? <comment236616> You might want to re-install the [10.10.4 Combo Update](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1820?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) to see if that re-installs Safari, too. <comment236627> Did you "Delete" it or just remove it from the Dock?  Go to your Applications folder, if it is there, drag it back to your dock.
