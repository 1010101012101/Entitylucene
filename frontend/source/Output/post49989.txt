Any way to put Mac mini to sleep remotely? <body> I use a Mac mini as a music centre connected to my stereo system (among other things). I control it remotely using apps such as Remote by Apple, Rowmote, and Remoteless (for Spotify), both on my iPhone and iPad.  Now, when getting to sleep myself, I often want to stop music playback with the device closest to hand, usually iPhone. strongOne more thing I'd like to do remotely is put the Mac mini to sleep/strong. Any idea whether this is possible?   To clarify, I'm looking for an app or other strongsolution that works on iPhone / iPad/strong (with latest iOS, not jailbroken).  <answer49991> I'm pretty sure you can do this with a hot-corner and the built-in VNC server. (You would need a VNC viewer for iOS, there are strongLOTS/strong of them.  You could also create an applescript:br codetell application "System Events" to sleep/codebr and run it using the VNC connection.  hr  Alternatively, you can turn on ssh, ssh in, and issue the command:br codepmset sleepnow/code supsub(See the pmset man page)/sub/supbr to put the mac to sleep.  This would require a ssh client for iOS. Again, there are a LOT of them. Personally, I have used iSSH, and it works fine.  hr  As @mankoff stated in a comment, RowMote states in it's store description:     ul   liSLEEP AND WAKE: Put your Mac to sleep by holding the Play button for 3 seconds while controlling any Apple application, just like the   hardware remote. Rowmote automatically wakes up sleeping machines   which are connected via Ethernet!/li   /ul   <answer49993> I use the following setup to sleep my Mac by using an iPhone:  ul liI created a AppleScript which sleeps the Mac/li liCreate a rule in Mail.app, which runs the AppleScript. (I use a specific Subject and from Address to activate the rule)/li liThen on the iOS device, you just need to send a mail, as soon as the Mac receives the mail it will go to sleep/li /ul  Advantage: You can put your Mac to sleep without the need to be in the same network  Disadvantage: It could take some minutes until the Mac receives the mail.  <comment57293> RowMote suppports sleep... <comment57294> @mankoff: oh, it does? How? Post that as an answer (with some details) & I'll accept it. <comment57296> I just don't find such option anywhere in Rowmote UI. Is it a Rowmote Pro feature? <comment57297> Look at the RowMote store page description - `SLEEP AND WAKE: Put your Mac to sleep by holding the Play button for 3 seconds while controlling any Apple application, just like the hardware remote.` <comment57300> I already had iSSH installed so I tried logging in an running `pmset` â€“ works nicely (but you have to type).  Anyway: thanks for teaching me how Rowmote works. Perfect! (And indeed, this works with regular Rowmote just fine; no Pro needed.) <comment57302> Hmm, not the simplest solution, but pretty creative :-)
