Is there a keyboard shortcut to move a window from one monitor to another? <body> Is there a free app that I can use to move a window from one monitor to the other monitor (assuming only two monitors) via the keyboard? I shouldn't have to use the mouse at all (e.g., for selecting the window or the monitor, or for dragging).  I know this can be done in Linux using compiz; I'm surprised there isn't a (free) option for OS X.  <answer28571> Moom can do this. It is not free, but Moom is a fantastic window management app. It lets you assign keyboard shortcuts to a variety of windows movements (including move to other display) and gives you an overlay of the OS X standard window controls.  Here are some emscreenshots/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AOwtE.jpg" alt="mouse usage" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P3BWu.jpg" alt="keyboard usage"  Here is a list of window management apps from another AskDifferent post, What Window Management Options exist for OS X?. The only free option is Shiftit, and I'm not sure if it offers the functionality you are looking for.  <answer30327> I ended up using BetterTouchTool to do this. Overall I found it to be the most configurable. Here is a screenshot of my configuration, whereas kbdCmd/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdW/kbd moves a window to the next monitor.  If you have a 3 monitor setup (2 external monitors and the Mac monitor), you can set up the "Move Window to Next Monitor" to the strongemright/em/strong by doing the following:   ol liset up a new shortcut, specify "Move Window to Next Monitor" as the Predefined Action/li liclick Attach Additional Action and emagain/em specify "Move Window to Next Monitor" as the action /li liVoila, you can now move a window to the monitor on the right (a little hacky I know, but it works until the developer of BTT updates the app)/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRYhs.png" alt="BetterTouchTool keyboard configuration"  The only shortcoming of BetterTouchTool is poor Lion support (not all features are available) but it is available as an alpha release. This specific keyboard shortcut should work fine in Lion with the stable version, I reckon.  <answer30346> ul liSizeUp/li liMoom/li liOptimal Layout/li liWindow Mover/li liBetterSnapTool/li liBetterTouchTool/li /ul  <answer82015> I just tried Spectacle, great app and it's free.  This is what it can do with the selected group of windows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3F9yj.png" alt="enter image description here"  You need to activate accessibility support.

So I started looking for alternatives. I installed Spectacles, changed the key bindings to be the same as ShiftIt's, and then when I wanted to deinstall ShiftIt, I found out it emdoes/em actually support moving windows to different screens, using kbdCtrl/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdN/kbd  So I uninstalled Spectacles; still a happy ShiftIt user.  <answer144408> BetterSnapTool also has this feature (as a shortcut). I think it was a free app, and its been a great one.  There is a shortcut where you can maximize the window in the next screen (among other shortcuts or ways of doing this). See the screenshot of the related shortcuts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v8Rqy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer240022> Just wanted to mention that there's a setting in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Mission Control/code called strong"Group windows by application"/strong that shows the app icons and allows you to drag the icon into another desktop/monitor. It's amazing for apps that have 10+ windows.  <answer281995> FYI, Magnet, the popular window placement/sizing application, has "Next Display" and "Previous Display" shortcuts right out of the box, at least in version 2.1 (Feb 14, 2017).  Magnet on the Mac App Store  Magnet's Website  <comment32851> +1 for Moom. Discovered it a few months ago, I love it. Great value at only $5 too. <comment32856> I've been using ShiftIt for arranging windows within the same monitor. It's an excellent tool for that. However, it offers no move-to-other-display functionality. <comment32858> I'd check out Moom then. I know you wanted a free app, but it's quite inexpensive compared to many other Mac window managers. Plus, the overlay they designed for close/min/maximize buttons is so spiffy that they deserve the $5. :) <comment34783> Oh, and it's freeware. <comment35135> I've gotten rid of Moom (almost ran out of trial clicks) and am using it BTT now. I feel like BTT can be slimmed down and polished but it does move windows from one monitor to another for free, so I can't complain. <comment96771> Worked for me without having to enable assistive devices in accessibility options. <comment125815> With OS X Mavericks, the option to enable access for assistive devices has moved to System Preferences - Security and Privacy - Privacy - Accessibility, where you will see Spectacle listed and can allow it to control your computer. <comment181001> @ArtemShnayder no longer true, ver 1.6 released this year now supports it; check out [@WilfredSpringer 's answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/107576/58743) <comment202133> wish they had "full screen on next monitor" too! <comment237694> it is called BetterTouchTool the free version and the option is found under window resize and move <comment269825> To specifically identity the shortcut, Spectacle use the shortcuts, ⌃⌥⌘← &   ⌃⌥⌘→ to alternate windows to each display. <comment279427> I use Spectacle already, so I tried this... unfortunately the first thing I tried (my own Java / OpenGL app) <comment282071> It's not freeware now. Donationware. <comment289417> BTT is no longer free <comment301554> I would add [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) to this list. <comment301555> As far as I could tell, BTT is no longer free (there's a free trial though) <comment301556> As far as I could tell, BTT is no longer free (there's a free trial though) <comment320010> it's awesome and can do many cool things that win7+ is able to do which I missed, BUT I couldn't make it do what the original question is asking - move the window across monitors. :( <comment331832> Love it! Thanks! <comment339430> [Spectacle](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fbvtt4g6tf93wux/spectacle_move_monitor.png) now allows you to do this (click link for image). <comment362320> Works well. Although a way to move windows from one screen(not monitor) to other could be helpful. Works for the question asked. <comment366927> Default for me was Ctrl+Option+Command+Space <comment369557> This should be the correct answer. It works.
