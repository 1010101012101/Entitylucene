Is it possible to open a Private Browser window in Safari using Terminal.app? <body> I'm trying to open a Private Browser window in Safari using Terminal. I could open Safari using open command and this way, codeopen /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari/code but I couldn't open a Private Browser window.  Please suggest how to open a Private Browser window from the command line.  <answer222119> Note: This is only one possible method. It works by simulating the pressing of kbdShift/kbdkbdCmd/kbdkbdN/kbd. You can also simulate the pressing of the menu item, but the script is longer.  Create a new file, and paste in these contents:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript tell application "Safari"     activate     delay 0.5     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "n" using {command down, shift down}     end tell end tell /code/pre  Save it somewhere (here, I'll pretend it's called codemyscript/code).  In Terminal, find the file and make it executable:  precodechmod +x myscript /code/pre  Simply run it to create a new private window in Safari  precode./myscript /code/pre  If you want to be able to use this script regardless of your current working directory, create an alias emOR/em move it to code/usr/local/bin/code.   If you want an alias, use  precodealias myscript='/path/to/script/myscript /code/pre  You can add this line to code~/.bashrc/code or code~/.bash_profile/code to automatically load this alias when you start Terminal.
