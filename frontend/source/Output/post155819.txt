Accessing ICloud Drive files from an iPad <body> I've added some files (photographs) to iCloud drive on my iMac.  Now, I'd like to access the files on my iPad. I've enabled the setting in "iCloud" on the iPad, like all of the tutorials say.  Now- how can I find those files using my iPad?   <answer155822> Have you made sure that you have also set iCloud Photo Library (Beta) in iCloud settings as well. This is under iCloud  Photos  "iCloud Photo Library (Beta)"  <comment183313> Welcome to Ask Different! This does not provide an answer to the question.
