Why does shift+clicking the icon of a minimized program cause it to open epic slowly? <body> If you minimize a program, then shift+click the icon to bring it up again, the sliding animation is slowed down immensely, making it open at an almost comical pace. I don't understand why this is a feature. Can anyone explain the reasoning behind this functionality?  <answer144381> Just like Cover Flow, it seems to be a “Steve Jobs wanted to use it in a Keynote”-Feature.  <comment170066> @Buscar웃 shift-click on an icon of a minimized window in the Dock - slow open <comment170067> to early for me in the morning, I try to used the space+click :(
