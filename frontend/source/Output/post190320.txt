Application/terminal method to encrypt a file and upon another application wanting to access it requiring a key to unlock it to be used <body> For database files for example that are used by another application, is there anyway to lock the file and upon using the application one puts in a username and password to unlock it for the application to use?  <comment225872> come again1 could you be bit more specific.
