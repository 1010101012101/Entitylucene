Ran codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app how do I reverse it? <body> I ran codecodesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app/code as per a post here  and now I cannot launch Bootcamp Assistant at all. Is there a terminal command I can run to reverse this?  <answer112480> There is no undo; permanent changes are made. The only way to resolve this situation would be to replace Boot Camp Assistant with a known-good copy. A simple way to do that is to reinstall OS X using Recovery Mode.  <comment132061> That's a pity. Would obtaining a fresh copy of bootcamp asst. work or is this a change made outside of the bootcamp resources? <comment132102> @user2528531 The code signing is done on the .app package, and restoring this should be fine since you did not create a specific certificate or any other external resources to perform this. If you have a Time Machine backup, you can use this to restore the file. Alternatively, use an OS X installer and Pacifist to extract the Boot Camp Assistant. <comment132194> Thanks very much. That worked although I can't copy the restored version to the utilities directory because it won't let me over write the original. It works run from another directory though.
