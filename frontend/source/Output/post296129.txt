Windows 10 formatted and re-partitioned my Mac USB drive <body> I had a USB thumb drive with two partitions, an HFS+ (journaled, encrypted) partition with around 118GB of space, and a second partition that was added using Disk Utility that was EX-FAT with around 10GB of space.  I originally only had the first partition, and used Disk Utility to resize it and add the second partition.  I was running Windows 10 in Parallels, inserted the USB drive and directed Parallels to use it in the Windows 10 VM.  A message then popped up in Windows 10 saying something about a new USB stick being found, and it needing to format it.  I assumed this meant that the EX-FAT partition I'd added was partitioned, but not formatted, so I clicked Yes and let it go ahead and format it.  Afterwards, I ejected the USB drive, and reconnected it, this time to OSX.  Now there are two partitions, the EX-FAT partition, still at 10GB, and a "NO NAME" partition, at about 2GB of space.  So my original HFS+ partition is gone.  And as for the remaining space (around 118GB), Disk Utility shows this space as a partition called "0xAC".  This doesn't show up in the list underneath the drive (where the other two partitions show up); it only shows up when highlighting the USB drive itself, where it shows a colored breakdown of the three "partitions" on the drive.  Anyone know how or why this happened?    I figured I should have been able to use that second EX-FAT partition with Windows 10, but I definitely didn't think it would destroy my HFS+ partition with a bunch of data on it :(
