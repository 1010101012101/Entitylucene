How can I add static route in order to access machine that had wrong static IP configured? <body> From time to time I end-up having to connect to a machine that was not configured to use DHCP.   Assuming that I know the static IP address of that machine and that this machine is already physically connected on my network, how do I add a custom route on MacOS in order to be able to ssh to that machine and reconfigure it?  I assume it is something like codesudo route add .../code  <answer265377> If the machine is in your network and you know it's IP address, you should be able to connect to it.  <answer265383> I do this all the time. There are 2 options:-  codessh user@&lt;IP&gt;/code for a known IP address  or if the machine has a hostname, the Mac should be able to discover it withbr codessh user@hostname.local/code  Similar settings can be used from most GUI codessh/code clients.  <comment332715> Is the static IP Address that's assigned to the machine in the same subnet as your network?
