Do I need "Install OS X Mavericks" after I've upgraded? <body> I have "Install OS X Mavericks" in my Applications folder even though I installed it a while ago. Does the system require this for utilities or something, or is there any reason to keep it around?  <answer138723> No. strongIf emyou/em have no use for it, delete it./strong The OS doesn't need it any more and if you want to reinstall OS X you can use the Recovery HD, so there's generally no need to keep it.  The post-install script will even delete it for you if its found in the default location as far as I know, but if you still have it there's no problem deleting it yourself.  <comment163665> only keep it to make a bootable UBS stick as emergency (if nothing else works), after that you can delete it to gain 5 Gig of disk space.
