Splitting a mac desktop into smaller portions <body> h1Background/h1  I'm using a device called a DualHead2Go that lets me plug two external screens into an early gen Macbook Pro. This device basically presents the two screens to the mac as if they were one gigantic 3840x1080 screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jlwGf.png" alt="DualHead2Go Layout"  The macbook's internal screen is on the right  h1The Problem/h1  For the most part this setup works really well - the problem I have is that, as far as the Mac is concerned, the middle of this desktop is right in the break between displays. Which leads to situations like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFLPN.jpg" alt="Items being split between displays"  Since this is my primary display, notifications and modal dialogs often come up right in the monitor split - not only is this ugly, it's a PITA to deal with.  h1Solutions/h1  In order of preference:  ul liSome application that would make the Mac work as if the "one display" were actually two.

There's a DualHead2Go &amp; TripleHead2Go User Guide for Mac. PowerDesk for Mac can be downloaded for 10.6 thru 10.10. See Download info.  Okay, instead of preferences in order, from your comment they're strongemall/em/strong requirements.  Try a combo of PowerDesk for Mac, Cinch and SizeUp.   <comment189980> Doesn't do what I want, unfortunately. It can differentiate between the screens, but the window management is limited to giving you a hotkey to fullscreen an application on one physical monitor.
