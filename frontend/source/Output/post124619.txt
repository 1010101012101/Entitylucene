How to stop auto-replacement of hyphens with horizontal rule? <body> If I wanted a horizontal rule, I'd type a string of em dashes. I can't find easily a way to disable this over-feature in TextEdit prefs ('Text replacement' is unticked) nor System Prefs ('Correct spelling automatically' is unticked). Thanks!  <answer124623> In the Edit menu, go to Substitutions, and uncheck Smart Dashes.  <comment145807> That does not work as OP said. <comment145845> That is not what OP said. OP specifically talked about "Text replacement"; however, unchecking this is not sufficient as you need to uncheck "Smart Dashes" too. Once "Smart Dashes" is unchecked, everything works as expected (verified on 4 Macs so far). <comment145848> Then bring that in your answer <comment145923> Thanks, that solved it. I dislike how TextEdit puts these things (spelling/grammar too) in both app prefs and the View menu. I rarely remember to look in the latter, and I get such mixed results based on whether an option is ticked in one place but not the other. <comment292602> Apparently not all apps have an edit  substitutions menu. iMessage however is one of the apps that does. Had to untick Smart Dashes there despite the fact that the system-wide setting already had this unticked in System Preferences  Keyboard  text (10.11.4)
