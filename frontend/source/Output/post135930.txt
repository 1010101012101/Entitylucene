App Store asking for other Apple ID when updating apps <body> My friend's mate reset his phone to prove him wrong about a situation and ever since then when he tries to update his apps it asks for his mom's iCloud password yet it says at the bottom of the App Store, iTunes and iCloud that it's signed into his account.  We have tried backing it up into his computer but that didn't help. What can be done?  <answer135931> If it's asking for a different Apple ID to update an app or apps, then they have been purchased on the other Apple account.  You can't change the Apple ID that an app has been purchased with. Instead, delete the app from the device and purchase it again with the Apple ID that you want the app registered to.  <comment167327> I'm having this same issue, and that makes sense for purchased apps. What if the Apple ID prompt is related to installing an OS update, like for Mavericks? Seems to behave the same way, but can't delete and reinstall without a full rebuild... <comment167336> @colemanm OS updates don't require an Apple ID afaik; are you clicking 'update all' with pending App Store apps also wanting to be updated? <comment167459> You're right, it does look like the OS updates actually still are installing, so my comment is a non-issue. :) Thanks! <comment183774> This was apparently my problem. I tried updating an app in an iPhone, and it was asking me for the password for an Apple ID (say, #2) different from the one that the phone was logged in to (say, #1). I removed the app, and purchased it again under ID #1. Is there any way of inquiring the ID under which an app was purchased? <comment328118> I am 1000% sure I purchased my app with my previous appId and now to update that it asks me for different apple id (which is my brother's id and whose password is unrecoverable). <comment334201> How can one find the offending application among all installed ? <comment334217> @xApple See my previous [reply to you](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/117814/attempting-to-update-app-asks-for-a-different-itunes-account-password/117817#comment334214_117817). <comment362240> Helped, Thank you
