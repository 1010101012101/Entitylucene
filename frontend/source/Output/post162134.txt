Dropbox109 process asking to access firewall on Yosemite <body> As the title says, I have a process called strongDropbox109/strong asking to access the internet. I have denied it.  I have Dropbox installed since Mavericks, and its been working fine (uploads/downloads/sync). What's suspicious is I got this Dropbox109 internet access request for the first time in a year of having Dropbox installed, and I couldn't find any information online.  Does anyone have any idea if it is a malicious program/virus or a legit process?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0GKVr.png" width="395"  <answer162137> No, it’s a legitimate, routine request from Dropbox used to check your OS X version. Due to formatting limitations, I’m unable to directly embed strongthis tweet/strong from the official Dropbox support account. See the screenshot below, and click the link to view the tweet.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ovyp9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment189483> Ahh, thanks so much for this! It makes sense - I recently upgraded to Yosemite. I REALLY appreciate the help! <comment189484> @rgamber no problem. Cheers! <comment201378> Do we know what's the purpose of the process? Because @rgamber said that denying internet access, didn't seem to affect dropbox functionality.
