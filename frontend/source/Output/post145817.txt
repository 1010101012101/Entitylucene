Can I back up my iPhone 5S to more than one MBP? <body> I have a 5S that's backed up to my home 13" MBP, as have every other iPhone before it.  I am getting a 6, and want to back up the 5S to restore to the 6.  I have a second MBP, a Retina 15", at work and I'm wondering if I can simply back up the phone to this Mac and restore from there -- so I don't need to drag the home MBP to work.  Can I back up my iPhones to more than one MBP?  <answer145914> No, your iPhone can only be associated with a single iTunes Library. You can, however, copy the backup folder from you MBP to somewhere else. It will be in  code~/Library/Application\ Support/MobileSync/Backup//code
