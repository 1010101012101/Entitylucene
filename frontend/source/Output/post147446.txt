Remove downloaded but not installed ios8 ( Settings->General->Usage doesn't work) <body> The ios8 has automatically downloaded to my iPad Air and I want to remove it. For some reason the solution with strongSettings-General-Usage doesn't work/strong for me. There is no ios update in the usage list. The current ios version is 7.0.4. Are there any strongother solutions/strong?  <comment173828> If it's not in the list under usage, how do you know it's been downloaded? <comment173841> It says the update is downloaded and ready to install.
