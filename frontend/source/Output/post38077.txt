Safari / iCal scroll animation <body> When I started using Lion, there was this "smooth scroll animation" in iCal and Safari, so when I swiped my finders left/right the next month/week or previous website showed up with a nice slide effect. Now Lion just shows that previous page instead of sliding it in. How can I turn on that feature again?  <answer38093> Go to System Preferences  Trackpad  More Gestures. Make sure that the first one is ticked and begins with "Scroll", rather than "Swipe". This should do it.  <comment43148> Great, thank you very much! <comment43236> You're very welcome. :) Welcome to Ask Different!
