I do not have enough space to restore my backup <body> I do not have enough space to restore my backup. I currently own a iPhone 6 with a 16 gb storage. My back up currently holds a 20 gb storage of photos. So I was wondering if I could restore my backup excluding my photos. And my backup is currently under iTunes.  <comment183296> Did you tried with some utility like [iTunes Data Recovery](http://www.any-data-recovery.com/product/itunes-data-recovery.htm)?
