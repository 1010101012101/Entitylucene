How do I create a Pivot Table in Numbers 3.2? <body> I'm new to Numbers and currently using Numbers 3.2.  I already have an idea of how to use SUMIFS to create Pivot Tables in Numbers, but I'm still looking for a better way to generate the column &amp; row names.  For example, if I have:  precodeA       B       C red     left    2 red     left    3 green   left    4 green   right   4 /code/pre  I want to be able to get:  precode        red     green   all left    5       4       9 right   0       4       4 all     5       8       13 /code/pre  When the dataset is 2x2, I can simply retype the column &amp; row names. But if the dataset is 20x10,000...  I read that they have this category feature in Numbers '09, but how do I implement it in Numbers 3.2?  <comment240417> [Possible duplicate](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52150/how-do-i-do-a-pivot-table-in-numbers?rq=1)
