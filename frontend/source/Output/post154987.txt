Can an iPhone be used without syncing to an Apple account? <body> I am attempting to loan my old iPhone 4s to a friend for her to use for apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Nothing else. She will not be connecting it to a phone number or carrier.  However, I do not want to connect the old iPhone to my Apple account for various reason, the most important being that I do not want any iMessages going to that phone instead of my current phone.  Is it possible to just use an Apple device for apps in this case?
