Swap Hard Disks <body> Is it in principle possible to swipe the hard disk out of a MacBook, swipe a new (blank) hard disk in, install the OS on the new disk, then swipe the old disk back in and find the machine operational again?  I would like to tinker with a new hard disk (bootcamp and perhaps rEFIt), but if that fails, I'd like to continue from the installation I have right now.  strongEdit/strong Clearly, the hard disk will be unchanged. My question is whether the process of installing OS X / bootcamp will change something (SMC, PRAM, ...?) that makes the machine incompatible with the previous installation.  <answer66840> Yes, certainly. Removing the original drive will leave it exactly as it was before.   <answer68513> On the first boot after changing a drive it may take an extra couple of seconds for the new boot destination to be written to the PRAM, but it won't cause any issues.   <comment79530> It's clear that nothing can change on the hard disk while it's disconnected. I have now clarified the question. <comment79568> I know a guy whose double boot was in fact a double drive. One for Windows, one for the Mac OS. Worked perfectly. <comment79842> @MatthieuRiegler Did this involve removing the internal drive every time, or could he reboot into the other OS without using a screwdriver (a KVM-style switch for SATA perhaps..?) ? <comment79870> Nope. He needed to remove 2 screws (Old Macbook) to change the HD. So it's not a very convinient solution but I works.
