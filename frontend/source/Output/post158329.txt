How to route map between two distinct points? <body> I feel that this must be a common and easy feature on the iPhone. I am looking for the ability to map between two distinct points on the iPhone by thumbtack.  I understand you can do it via explicit address, but this is not often at hand and this method runs against several use cases (e.g. Mapping run route).  How to do this?  <answer158410> ol liDrop a pin and add the location to your bookmarks./li liDrop another pin and tap the directions button./li liSelect the first location as the location in your bookmarks and the second location should already be set to the second dropped pin location./li /ol  <answer188027> My final method.  ol liOpen location A, copy the address./li liOpen location B/li liClick 'Directions to Here'/li liPaste into 'Start' location A. Done!/li /ol  It's a wee bit embarrassing that Apple does not have a central, clean and distinct feature set to address this. That is the definition of Apple in the 21st century, solve every problem, and give an app for it.  Not this one I guess. Despite the fact that it is a primary use model of mapping...  <comment186420> This works! Thank you!
