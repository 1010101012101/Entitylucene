Auto update apps on device when syncing in iTunes <body> I have several devices.  After updating apps on the device that I used to purchase apps, I can sync the updates to my iTunes on the Mac using USB cable.  All but one device got the apps updated when connected to my Mac and "Sync" using USB cable.  The one device that did not automatically update apps, I have to manually select one by one.  What happens?  I thought I had seen an option to enable auto update apps when syncing a while back.  But can't seem to find it anywhere now.
