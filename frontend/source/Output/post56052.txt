How to create a playlist in Quicktime Player for many files in separate subfolders? <body> I have a folder of .mov files that are all part of a video tutorial session. The directory looks like:   precodeTuts/   Tut1/     Chapter1/       1-1.mov       1-2.mov       1-3.mov     Chapter2/       2-1.mov       2-2.mov    Tut2/      ... /code/pre  While trying to watch this series I have to go back to Finder and open the next .mov file in order to get start the next video. I've been looking around Google and can't seem to find a way to make Quicktime Player just play the videos in order.  Is there any way to import this folder into Quicktime Player and just play them all in order without having to close Quicktime Player, go back to Finder, find the next video, open that video with Quicktime Player?  <answer56056> Quicktime Player (X or version 7) doesn't support playlists to my knowledge. You could add the files to a playlist in iTunes, or download VLC. I'd highly recommend VLC, it's free, it can tackle pretty much any format you can throw at it (including .mov), and you can just drag and drop files to a playlist to queue them up very simply.  <answer56068> If you create your own movie player using the QuickTime Framework it's possible to add whatever functionality you want. QuickTime Player itself does not appear to offer playlist capability on Mac OS X. Here's a few screen captures of my movie player using a playlist:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RGNDD.jpg" alt="QuickTime w/Playlist"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Ex8b.jpg" alt="QuickTime Custom Player"  <answer81968> Try Graphic Converter. It's good for lots of other things but you can use its slideshow features to play, for example, all the movies in a particular folder. Other than making sure the movies you want are in the folder, you don't have to actually make any kind of playlist. If you have .jpgs in the same folder, it will include them too, as part of your slideshow.  It's shareware, and well worth the US$35 for all the other stuff it does too.  But you can use it for free for a month or so, uncrippled, to see everything it can do.  I don't have the website handy but if you do a search, you'll find it easily enough. LemkeSoft, I believe, is the developer.  <comment64370> I compiled a simple movie player that uses the Quicktime Framework which will play a selection of files in the order you choose; Quicktime Player itself cannot â€” I'll post it if you're interested. <comment64372> Nice... I didn't even know this was possible. <comment64374> The app will allow you to save your playlist too.

There is no need to close the Player after every movie. <comment104046> Thanks for sharing.This app will prove to be very useful, especially when viewing lessons from tutorial sites. <comment293831> Interesting.  It's 2016 and I still go to VLC for this.  Just drop in a folder and the sequence starts playing.  Wish there was something more polished but VLC still rocks.
