What all file metadata is available in macOS? <body> I have gone through Windows versioning information: Please Check out Windows file versioning information  Now Windows provide quite an ample amount of information like productname, productversion, CompanyName, Comments, FileDescription and so on.  I went through codemdls/code command and that information is very less compare to what Windows provide.   Does anyone have idea how to get equivalent information for Mac OS's (preferably in Sierra &amp; El-Capitan) files as well ?  <answer274754> Applications on macOS store similar types of metadata in codeInfo.plist/code files stored within the application bundles themselves.  For example to see the metadata available for Safari you can run the following command in a Terminal window.  codeplutil -p /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist/code  Or to get the version of Safari specifically you can run...  codeplutil -p /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep CFBundleShortVersionString/code  <comment345611> This does provide lot of needed information, Thank you for your answer
