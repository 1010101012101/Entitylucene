Setting user & group in a new installation (Mac) <body> Our product is an Audio Units that needs to be installed in /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/  In order to allow automatic updates, we need to create the Audio-Unit bundle (ourapp.component) with the lowest possible permissions.  What should we set as the owner/group permissions?  We can set the group to 'staff', but what about the owner?  Thank You!
