Add circle animation to cursor when clicked <body> I want to know does any solution exist to add a circle around the cursor when I click on the screen?  <answer95122> I have found PinPoint for OS X. This is what I asked for.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9CA9k.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer202042> Wrt PinPoint- this application is available from the Apple App Store.  The price is, today, 4.99â‚¬ (that translates to about 5.5USD).  I use this application myself; is highly customisable, and quite useful on large screens (I have a 27" iMac) in order to find the cursor.  You may define a keyboard shortcut to enable/disable PinPoint.  Just a comment: when capturing a window on the screen, disable PinPoint first: if not, you will capture the "circle" itself around the cursor.  <comment111545> Welcome to the site!
