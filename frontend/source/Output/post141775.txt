How to remove the device name from the bash prompt? <body> Is it possible to remove the device name in my shell commands to "save space"?    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeMy-MacBook-Pro:~ username$ /code/pre  to  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code~ username$ /code/pre  <answer141776> Yes, BASH (the default OS X Shell) has the ability to customize the prompt in many ways.  code$PS1/code is the the shell variable for the main prompt.  Try typing codeecho $PS1/code in the command line and it will show you how $PS1 is currently configured.  If you just want to remove the the host name you can set $PS1 to code\W \u\$/code (note there is a space after the code$/code) (i.e.code$PS1="\W \u\$ "/code)  If you want this to happen every time you login in you will need to add codeexport $PS1="\W \u\$ "/code to your code.bashrc/code file.  There is extensive information on setting the PS1 prompt with other options in the codeman bash/code page.  <comment167062> BTW the BASH manpage (`man bash`) is huge. If you want to go through it sensibly, type: `man -t bash | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app/`. This opens a copy of the manpage in Preview (which you can then save as a pdf). <comment167075> Thanks! It worked like a charm.
