5 minute battery life <body> I have a Late 2011 Mac Book Pro 15" and recently the battery has very quickly gone from several hours of battery life to all of a sudden only apparently having 5-10 minutes   and by quickly I mean over the course of just a few weeks..  What i want to know is is this the End of life for my battery or is it malfunctioning and need a battery reset   If this a battery reset issue how do I do this on a mac I used to do this in the BIOS when I owned a PC Laptop but no idea how to do this with a Mac Book since there isn't one   Is this something that can be done through AHT?  precode  Battery Information:    Model Information:   Serial Number:    D86130308TRDGDLAW   Manufacturer: SMP   Device Name:  bq20z451   Pack Lot Code:    0   PCB Lot Code: 0   Firmware Version: 406   Hardware Revision:    2   Cell Revision:    158   Charge Information:   Charge Remaining (mAh):   156   Fully Charged:    Yes   Charging: No   Full Charge Capacity (mAh):   156   Health Information:   Cycle Count:  358   Condition:    Service Battery   Battery Installed:    Yes   Amperage (mA):    0   Voltage (mV): 11896  System Power Settings:    AC Power:   System Sleep Timer (Minutes): 10   Disk Sleep Timer (Minutes):   10   Display Sleep Timer (Minutes):    10   Wake on AC Change:    No   Wake on Clamshell Open:   Yes   Wake on LAN:  Yes   Current Power Source: Yes   Display Sleep Uses Dim:   Yes   GPUSwitch:    2   PrioritizeNetworkReachabilityOverSleep:   0   Standby Delay:    4200   Standby Enabled:  0   Battery Power:   System Sleep Timer (Minutes): 10   Disk Sleep Timer (Minutes):   10   Display Sleep Timer (Minutes):    2   Wake on AC Change:    No   Wake on Clamshell Open:   Yes   Display Sleep Uses Dim:   Yes   GPUSwitch:    2   Reduce Brightness:    Yes   Standby Delay:    4200   Standby Enabled:  0  Hardware Configuration:    UPS Installed:    No  AC Charger Information:    Connected:    Yes   ID:   0x0100   Wattage (W):  85   Revision: 0x0000   Family:   0x0085   Serial Number:    0x0058432a   Charging: No /code/pre  <answer103837> While I can't explain the rapid loss in battery life, the best way to determine the battery health would be through the system profiler. There are instructions on how to check the battery cycle count on a Mac here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1519  Along with benchmarks for healthy cycle counts.  For what it's worth, my 15" MacBook Pro needed a replacement battery a few months ago. Although the decline in battery life was a little bit more prolonged.  <answer103854> Possibly your battery has developed a phenomenon called internal temporary short or known as Whisker.  A whisker is a deposits growth inside the batter between the positive and negative pole consisting of Lithium crystals.  Eventually this deposit shorts the poles leading to battery life time shortage and erratic behavior.  There is not much you can do about that other than getting a new battery.

Obviously there are also online stores you can buy official and unofficial replacements for as little as $70 if you're into that.
