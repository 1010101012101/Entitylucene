Sluggish loading of Launchpad <body> I often experience a very sluggish Launchpad: After launch, all icons are unsharp, then a sharp version of each icon gets loaded one by one. During this time Launchpad interaction is not possible. It can be closed and reopened, but clicked apps only open emafter/em all icons are loaded. Since I have a lot of apps, loading easily takes 20 seconds, thus rendering the use of Launchpad an unpleasant experience. What is the reason for this behaviour and is there anything I can do to fix it? I am using OS X 10.9.3 on a Macbook Pro Mid 2010.  <comment159596> I am using a 1080p external screen. <comment159701> Were you having this problem before Mavericks? I know I have been having problems switching apps, using dashboard, etc since the upgrade. It has something to do with changes to the power management. <comment159702> @user3623501 No, it started after I upgraded to Mavericks. How is power management involved there? Is the Launchpad put to sleep or something? <comment159716> I believe it has something to do with the new app nap feature. It drives me crazy with virtual box, when I send a virtual machine to the background it stops what its doing, and when I put the focus back it takes sometimes 10-30 seconds to start running smoothly again.
