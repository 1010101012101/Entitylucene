How long does a clean install of Lion take? <body> How long should I expect it to take to do a clean install of Lion on an already-formatted disk? I'm using a mid-2010 15" MacBook Pro with an i7 and a 5,400RPM 500GB hard drive.  (I ask because I think my hard drive is in bad condition, and the installation seems like it's taking too long.)  <answer19030> About 40 minutes or so. I'm assuming a 5400RPM drive, 7200RPM or an SSD would be faster, obviously.  <answer19046> Macbook Pro i7 2.66GHz - USB install (copy image to USB, not install via Snow Leopard).  1st part (downloading additional components) : ~8 minutes  2nd part (actual install) : ~18 minutes  <comment20852> Since you install on a clean drive, is it possibly *downloading* the installer? <comment20854> Exactly. The installer on the restore partition only contains a base system. It'll download any needed components from the 'net.
