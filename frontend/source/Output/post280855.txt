Changing right-hand Command & Alt key order to be like a Windows keyboard <body> I would like to switch the Right Command (âŒ˜) Key order with the Alt Key under the System Preferences (to be just like Windows) but there appears to be no option under System Preferences.  Does anyone know how to move these keys' locations using Karabiner-Elements or some other software?  In this case we would swap the right-hand Alt and Command keys.  img src="https://cdn1.tekrevue.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mac-system-preferences-modifier-keys.png" alt="Modifier Keys in System Preferences"  <answer281332> Do you want to swap strongOption (Alt)/strong with strongCommand/strong or strongControl/strong with strongCommand/strong?   See Changing modifier keys from the command line  <answer283331> Apple's Technical Note TN2450 describes how to remap keys.  It is important to know that Right Command is also Right GUI.  Running the following command will switch strongRight Command/strong and strongRight Alt/strong (if you also want to do the Left Command and Left Alt, refer to the technical note to get the hex values and the Python code below to do the codeor/code operation).    precodehidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":     [{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x7000000e7,       "HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000e6},      {"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x7000000e6,       "HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000e7}] }' /code/pre  The table at the bottom of the Technical Note has a list of hex values for each key.  To generalize the above answer to switch any keys (at least is macOS Sierra), you must codeor/code the hex value from that list together with code0x700000000/code.  The following Python code demonstrates one way to do this.  precodeIn [1]: def convert(val):    ...:     int_val = int(val, 16)    ...:     ref = '0x700000000'    ...:     int_ref = int(ref, 16)    ...:    ...:     return hex(int_ref | int_val)    ...:  In [2]: r_alt = '0xE6'  In [3]: print(convert(r_alt)) 0x7000000e6 /code/pre  <answer283535> A more general and user-friendly approach is to use Karabiner-Elements, which is a version of Karabiner that works on Sierra.  Karabiner-Elements allows for your specific use case (that's how I use it) in addition to almost any other kind of key remapping.

I stated this in the question.  I have posted this as an issue on github and as of a couple months ago modifier keys weren't supported. <comment358480> I'm currently using Karabiner Elements to map right command key to right option (alt) key. I suggest you download and test - maybe the author just hasn't updated your issue (there are over 400 issues logged). <comment358483> Could you post your configuration then?  That is what I stated in the question. <comment358745> Here you go, I added an image to the answer.
