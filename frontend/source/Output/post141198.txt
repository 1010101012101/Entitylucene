How many fans does a MBP 13" late 2013 have? <body> I was wondering how many fans a MBP 13" retina from late 2013 has, since I downloaded iStat Menus to check for internal temperatures because I thought my mbp was running fairly hot...  Now in the menu of the app, I can only see the speed of the RightSide fan, and I was wondering whether there is a leftside fan as well?   Can someone also specify the normal working range temperatures of this type of mbp, since I hope these temperatures are not really creating a problem.  <answer141200> The late 2013 Macbook Pro 13" only has one fan. You can see here in iFixit's teardown.  Apple don't publish figures for normal working range temperature for their devices, and unfortunately you'll find many and varied opinions online. Apple do publish a short guide if you are concerned that your Macbook is overheating though.
