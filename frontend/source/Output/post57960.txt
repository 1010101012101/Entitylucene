How can I export text substitutions from Lion for import into Mountain Lion <body> I am trying to migrate to a brand new install of Mountain Lion. I am trying to migrate select data from my old Lion install. Does anybody know where the text replacement definitions in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Language &amp; Text &gt; Text/code lie? I would like to migrate them to my Mountain Lion install.  <answer58059> Programmatically speaking, each substitution is a dictionary written to the NSUserReplacementItems array at the root of the ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist file.   I'm not able to think of a simple way to move data, even with Xcode's Property List Editor, from 1. an invisible file 2. in a hidden folder 3. to a specific part of the new systems file. To get you started, you can read them all with codedefaults read .GlobalPreferences NSUserReplacementItems/code or, if you want to just pull one(the first I'm seeing that I just customized in Lion is located at index #15, therefore): code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print :NSUserReplacementItems:15" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code which would return something like this:  precodeDict { replace = bIg  with = BigBabyBuggyBumpers on = 1 } /code/pre  And then writing the stuff back could be done in any scripting language that speaks apple's xml, or piecemeal with the trio of:  code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Add :NSUserReplacementItems:16:on integer 1' ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code (which turns the checkbox on)  code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Add :NSUserReplacementItems:16:replace string "bIg"' ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code  code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Add :NSUserReplacementItems:16:with string "BigBabyBuggyBumpers"' ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code  I'll tweet it out, someone probably has the easier way and can chime in or build on this.  <answer58373> Thanks to Sacrilicious identifying the actual file/key where the data is stored, I figured out how to copy the whole thing with a few Terminal commands.  emMake sure you don't have System Preferences open while doing this, or it may not work!/em  ol liOn your strongold/strong install, run code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c "Print NSUserReplacementItems" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist &gt; backup.plist/code ul liThis saves the substitutions to the codebackup.plist/code file in whatever directory you ran that command from (by default, your home directory)./li /ul/li liCopy that codebackup.plist/code file to your strongnew/strong install (I recommend your home directory for simplicity)./li liOn the strongnew/strong install, run code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Delete NSUserReplacementItems" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code, then run code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Add NSUserReplacementItems array" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code ul liThis wipes the default substitution list and creates a new blank one./li /ul/li liAgain on the new install, run code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Merge /PATH-TO-BACKUP/backup.plist NSUserReplacementItems" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code, first replacing the code/PATH-TO-BACKUP/backup.plist/code part with the actual path to wherever you saved the backup file./li /ol  That should do it. Open System Preferences to double check, but you should have an identical copy of your text substitutions on your new install.  <answer211315> I found an easier way to do it.  Use these steps to export your existing text substitutions: - Open System Preferences  Keyboard  Text.  ul liSelect the shortcuts you want to export. If you want to export all of your text substitutions, select one of them, then choose Select All from the Edit menu./li liDrag the selected shortcuts to the desktop. This creates a file name Text Substitutions.plist that contains the substitutions you selected./li liClose the System Preferences window./li /ul  Use these steps to import the plist file you created in another user account: - Copy the plist file you previously created to the /Users/Shared/ folder, or to an external drive.  ul liLog in as the user account where you want to use these text substitutions./li liOpen System Preferences  Keyboard  Text./li liDrag the Text Substitutions.plist file to the area of the System Preferences window where the text substitutions are shown (under Replace or With)./li liClose the System Preferences window./li /ul  source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204006  <comment67622> LIFESAVER. Thanks a million. <comment96396> This is a great answer to obscure problem… And to make it even better I whipped up a quick Automator app, "the Text Replacement Migration Assistant", lol, that makes it even easier. find it at [github.com/mralexgray](https://github.com/mralexgray/TextReplacementMigrationAssistant) <comment114292> Having issues like "Merge: Error Reading File:" (due to bash missing expansion) merging files with `PlistBuddy` from your user profile folder, check this example `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Merge '$(ls ~/Documents/OS\ X/common-typos.plist)' NSUserReplacementItems" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist` <comment114304> @ProBackup I suspect the error is due to the command expansion (`$(ls ~/Documents/OS\ X/common-typos.plist)`). You should just have a direct path to the plist file, *i.e.* `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Merge '~/Documents/OS\ X/common-typos.plist' NSUserReplacementItems" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist`. <comment141029> “NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems” seems to be what you’re after for Mavericks, just in case anyone’s trying to do this on OS X 10.9. :)
