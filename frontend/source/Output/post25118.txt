Export Notes from Entourage to Apple Mail <body> Is it Possible to export the notes made in Entourage 2008 V 12.0.0 to Apple Mail notes? How do I do it?  <answer40165> You can Export your notes in Entourage by going to strongFile/strong  strongExport.../strong or selecting strongShift/strong + strongCommand/strong + strongS/strong, and then check boxing only strongNotes/strong. When this is exported to a location of your choice (e.g. Desktop), it saves as a strong.rge/strong. This file type cannot be opened in Apple Mail. strongShow Package Contents/strong reveals a strongNotes/strong folder with your exported notes encrypted inside that can only be opened via Entourage. I more or less ran into a dead end trying to figure this out for you.  As far as I could figure out, this cannot be done any easier way than the following:  ul liOpen Entourage/li liGo to strongNotes/strong/li liGo to strongEdit/strong  strongSelect All/strong (or strongCommand/strong + strongA/strong) to select all of your notes/li liGo to strongFile/strong  strongPrint/strong (or strongCommand/strong + strongP/strong) to act like you will print all of your notes/li liSelect strongPDF/strong  strongSave As PDF.../strong and select a location of your choice (e.g. Desktop)/li liTry and import these into strongApple Mail/strong, and if unsuccessful import the PDFs you just created into strongEvernote/strong/li liRejoice or sulk depending on the situation and/or your mood/li /ul  Let me know if you have any futher questions, and I promise that you'll enjoy strongEvernote/strong if forced to use it. It's the business!  <answer211710> The select all, print, PDF worked beautifully. I can't tell you how long I tried to find an easy way. You did! SO cool!  <comment255586> Welcome to Ask Different!
