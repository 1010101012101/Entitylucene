Xcode failed to open with error: Scanning for plug-ins failed <body> I went to get onto Xcode, but when I tried to open it, I got this error:  precodeScanning for plug-ins failed. /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4qERH.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried re-installing Xcode, but that did not solve the issue.  Why did this start happening all of a sudden? Did I accidentally mess-up privileges some how?  After following a suggestion, here is the list of permissions:  precodetotal 0 drwxr-xr-x  62 root  wheel  2108 Mar 15 19:21 . drwxr-xr-x  17 root  wheel   578 Mar 24 15:02 .. drwxr-xr-x   3 root

Mar  8 17:23 iCloudSupport.ideplugin /code/pre  And the permissions for the plugin folder:  precodedrwxr-xr-x  62 root  wheel   2108 Mar 15 19:21 PlugIns /code/pre  It looks correct to me, but I might be wrong.  <answer232900> It seems that at some point, plugins were moved to (Edit: it seems these are only the standard plugins and plugins added by the user are still in the old place.  The standard plugins may have been there forever for all I know.)  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns /code/pre  I was able to reproduce this problem by changing permissions on one of the plugins residing in the above directory.  (Edit: You get the same if you change permissions on the plugins in ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/ but since you don't have any of those, it shouldn't matter.)  The permissions should be drwxr-xr-x  so in Terminal:  precodecd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns sudo chmod 755 * /code/pre  should help, possibly with the -R option.  Note: If you have a very old Xcode installation that has been upgraded since the dawn of time, plugins may show up in (at least) the following locations:  precode~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins ~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Shared/Plug-ins ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Plug-ins /code/pre  I would delete them all and put new ones in the current standard location.  (I just did)  <answer233975> I managed to get it working again by downgrading to version 7.2.1. Not ideal, but at least I can work now!  strongUpdate:/strong  Because of changes made in Xcode 7.3, I was having Issues doing certain things, so I downloaded Xcode 7.3.1 and it works.  <comment284480> What output do you have after: `ls -l ~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/` ? Mine is: `drwxr-xr-x  14 username  staff  476 24 mar 09:19 Plug-ins`. Perhaps you have the wrong permissions. <comment284492> @MateuszSzlosek, I got this error: `ls: /Users/calebklevetertest/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/: No such file or directory` <comment284507> Nothing here either and Xcode loads ok, the error is definitely not caused by lack of that directory. <comment284509> @techraf. Do you have cocoapods installed? <comment284589> No. I don't have. <comment284656> Shouldn't this be `755` ? <comment284661> Yes it should, typo fixed <comment284711> Still getting the error. Should I try re-booting or something? <comment284723> @CalebKleveter I don't see how rebooting should help, but it's always worth a try.  I have not been able to reproduce the error message any other way (but I've gotten lots of other ones trying :) do an ls -al and see if you have the correct permissions on all the plugins perhaps? <comment284724> I just edited my post. Take a look. <comment284730> @CalebKleveter  That looks right to me.  The only possible remaining problem I can think of is that you may have an outdated/incompatible plugin stashed away somewhere on your system.  I don't so can't reproduce, but try searching your entire system for *.xcplugin and just delete any you find? <comment284742> I did a search and found that I had deleted Xcode so I could reinstall it, meaning there was some stuff in the trash. I emptied the trash, but the problem remains. <comment285087> Caleb, have you removed Xcode so you don't have **any** Xcode installed (and no Xcode present in the trash) and then attempted a clean install?
