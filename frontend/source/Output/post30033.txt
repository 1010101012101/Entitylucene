Ooops. How can I re-install the Mac App Store? <body> I'm running Mac OS X version 10.7.2.  There's this app called app-zapper. It helps to remove the library and cache files from apps when you want to get rid of an app by "zapping" it. I needed to shave some space. I'm using Pixelmator now instead of Photoshop, so I tried to zap my Adobe folder but instead my App Store app got zapped. I didn't realize it till my trash was emptied. The rest writes itself.  I've tried reinstalling 10.7.2, extracting the App Store.app file from 10.7.2 package (it's incomplete) and re-downloading the snow leopard extracted one (don't work on lion).  How can I re-install the app store?  <answer30034> Many options are available to you:  ul liRestore it from your backup/li liCopy it from another Mac running 10.7.2/li liDownload and apply the current combo updater (often they contain entire programs, but it's not a guaranteed thing)/li liReinstall Lion and upgrade to 10.7.2 - if your Lion install is lower than 10.7.2 try not to run programs until they are all patched up to the same version as your existing software./li /ul  <answer30054> Here's my copy, hope it helps.  http://www.ilorentz.org/~gio/public/App%20Store.zip  PS: I'm going to remove it next week, so be quick!  <comment34458> Another alternative would be to use something like Pacifist and pull it directly from the InstallESD.dmg and then run the 10.7.2 combo update afterwards. <comment34530> I tried all those things except for the backup and the reinstall of Lion. Nothing helped. I'm going to try Geo's, and if that doesn't work, the re-install. (eeekkk) <comment34532> Success!!! Thx very much. <comment34559> I deleted it, so now be good and don't erase it again :D
