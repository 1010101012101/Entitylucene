How to switch or close the new split Terminal pane? <body> I stumbled across the kbdCMD/kbd-kbdD/kbd hot key which splits the Terminal into 2 panes.  But I can't find documentation anywhere on how to close the new pane or even switch the focus to it so I can use it. What are the other commands?  <answer87204> The idea behind splitting is that it allows you to keep a certain part of the shell buffer displayed while continuing to enter new commands. So only the lowest split does allow keyboard input. To position the view on the shell buffer use the scroll bar.  You can un-split by pressing kbdShift-Cmd-D/kbd.  <answer156260> In the most current version of Iterm2, navigate to codePreferences &gt; Profiles &gt; Keys/code.  Select the code+/code sign and add new key shortcut. Then scroll to the bottom and select codeSend Escape Sequence/code. Do this twice and after you select escape sequence simply put a codeb/code in the text box for left and an codef/code for right.

I just wanted to add that in general OS-X shortcuts that are done with kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbdchar/kbd are undone (or the opposite/complement command is executed) with kbd⌘ Command/kbd kbd⌘ Shift/kbd-kbdchar/kbd.  <comment101882> Thanks, I read that shift-cmd-d split horizontally somewhere else but never tried it. <comment101884> It's in the menu actually :-) <comment101886> Related to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6504/how-do-split-panes-in-terminal-work?rq=1, but the keyboard shortcut isn't mentioned there. <comment136148> Is it also possible to create a new terminal session instead on split? <comment310558> I'm not going to vote to close - whilst it's not really an answer, it does add a useful snippet of information. <comment349590> See also [How do I disable Cmd-D in Terminal?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/254222/60079). <comment364546> @ErikAigner, a little late to the party, but Cmd-T should open a new session in a tab.
