photos missing after rebuild of Photos 2 library <body> I rebuilt my Photos 2 library in Sierra (holding command-option down during launch). After the rebuild was finished, I noticed that many of my albums now have 0 or greatly reduced numbers of photos, and overall I went from 40K to 2,736 photos! Actually, a bit of digging in my Photos library revealed that the photos are all present in the "Masters" subfolder, but most have apparently been lost to the program.  Now here's the kicker:  I restored from the latest backup, but the Photos immediately forced a rebuild (how does it detect that?), and I wound up in the same state as before.  So I'm at a loss as to what to do. I'm not using iCloud Photo Library.
