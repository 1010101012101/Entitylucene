Gmail contact folder disappeared <body> The contact folder in my Gmail disappeared, both on iPhone and iPad. How do I get it back?  <answer54805> can you post a screen shot? Ideally it should appear in the dropdown menu of the Gmail text on the top left about 1.2 inches from the top, next to it a small downward arrow, click on the arrow, contact should be the 2nd choice  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fs6ZV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment62796> Are you talking about the Gmail web client or the Gmail account you created in the native Mail.app?
