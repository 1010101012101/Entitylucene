Show history of IP addresses assigned to iMac for a period of time? <body> Is there a way to view the list of IP addresses that were assigned to my iMac over a period of time (e.g., the last 30 days)? I'd like to get this information from the iMac itself if possible.  <answer148983> By default your mac won't keep a history of DHCP address and times.  I put together a launchd and script that should do the trick if you must have client side records for DHCP times and ips.  launcd plist called strongcom.local.DHCP-History.plist/strong that needs to be placed in strong/Library/LaunchDaemons//strong  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;DHCP_History&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/DHCPhistoryLog.sh&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases/*&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Here is the script it will run, I put it in strong/usr/bin//strong but you can put where you want just make sure to change the environment path in the launch daemon.  You will have to create a folder called strongDHCP_History/strong in strong/private/var/log//strong to create the log files in.  DHCP_History.sh  precode#!/bin/bash # # tron_jones 09-10-14  # Create a log for DHCP changes and put in new folder with date dateVar=`date`  mkdir /private/var/log/DHCP_History/"$dateVar"  path="/private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases/" logPath="/private/var/log/DHCP_History/" for i in `ls /private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases/` do     cp "${path}${i}" "${logPath}${dateVar}"/DHCP_ChangeHistory_"${i}".log done /code/pre  Make sure that the script is executable and owned by root:wheel.  Run these commands to do that:  precodesudo chmod +x /usr/bin/DHCP_History.sh  sudo chown root:wheel /usr/bin/DHCP_History.sh /code/pre  Now every time DHCP gets renewed or changes it will create a file called strongDHCP_ChangeHistory.log/strong inside strong/private/var/log/DHCP_History/emthedate/em//strong  <comment175463> Where are you looking to get this information from?  Your local mac? or your dhcp server, taking you have one available? <comment175467> @tron_jones Local MAC.
