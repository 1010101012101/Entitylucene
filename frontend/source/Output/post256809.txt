Android tethering: Mac doesn't detect new network interface <body> I am trying to share my 3G internet connection from my Nexus 4 running Android 5.1.1 with my Macbook Pro running emmacOS Sierra 10.12/em. Using an USB cable (aka USB Tethering). After connecting the phone and turning on the emUSB tethering/em option, When I go to em"Open Network Preferences"/em from the network icon in the status bar, I don't see my phone listed as expected to proceed with the configuration.  Although, I do see my phone in strongAbout this mac - Overview - System Report - Hardware - USB/strong. The emAndroid File Transfer/em app opens when I connect it to the computer, and it closes when I turn on tethering.  I tried installing HoRNDIS, and even restarting afterwards, but didn't solve. Tried to play around the emUSB Debugging/em option as well without success.  My broadband allows tethering since I can do it over Wifi and Bluetooth really straightforward.  Have anyone experienced and sorted something like that? Is HoRNDIS mandatory for the purpose or should Sierra come with some out-of-the-box driver? Any help is highly appreciated!  Thank you!  <comment320643> ["Heads up: HoRNDIS does NOT yet work on Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)! "](http://joshuawise.com/horndis#available_versions) -  How is it supposed to work with Sierra then? <comment321487> My question is about tethering in general, and I just wanted to make clear that I even tested HoRNDIS, before someone suggest.
