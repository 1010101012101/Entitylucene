Combine files by name and zip <body> How can I automatically ZIP files with same file names (different extensions) into one ZIP?  For example I have four files   ul liking.jpg/li liking.txt/li liqueen.jpg/li liqueen.txt/li /ul  which would led to  ul liking.zip (containing king.jpg and king.txt)/li liqueen.zip (containing queen.jpg and queen.txt)/li /ul  <answer219662> you can put both into one folder and zip that folder..  otherwise you need to use tar, which is a bit more complicated...  <answer219674> You can easily do this with a short bash snippet.  precodep=SOME.CRAZY.STUFF for i in *; do     f="${i%.*}"     if [[ "$p" != "$f" ]]; then         zip "$f" "$f".*     fi     p="$f" done /code/pre  hr  If you are not familiar with Terminal/bash and don't plan to use this too often, you can do the following to use it:  ul licreate a folder where you move all your kings and queens to (and nothing else)/li liopen Terminal, type codecd/code followed by a space, drag the folder you've just created into the Terminal window (release the mouse button once a green cross appears) and press kbdEnter/kbd/li litype codep=SOME.CRAZY.STUFF/code followed by kbdEnter/kbd/li litype (or even better copy/paste)  precodefor i in *; do f="${i%.*}"; if [[ "$p" != "$f" ]]; then zip "$f" "$f".*; fi; p="$f"; done /code/pre  again followed by kbdEnter/kbd/li li(assuming no error message etc was displayed) quit Terminal again/li /ul  <comment265870> thanks patrix. this one looks interesting. would you like to expand how to use it. <comment265873> I assume you are not familiar with Terminal/bash then? I'll update the answer later (= when I'm in front of a Mac again).
