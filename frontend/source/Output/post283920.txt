developer.apple.com is not responding properly (very slow) <body> From last few days, I can not Open the developer.apple.com site properly, is there any problem in their end,  I have tried from more than 4 different high speed connection using the Mac(Sierra version 10.12.1)'s own safari(10.0.1 (12602.2.14.0.7)) browser, It is responding Very slow, even after 10 min it is showing like the below image.  Is there any regional problem of apple developer site now, because One of my clint from Russia, they are saying developer.apple.com is opening smoothly there. But apple.com is opening easily here also. Can any one know, why it is not opening in Kolkata, India? is there any regional problem for developer account now?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ny31j.png" alt="Screenshot after 10min of waiting"  EDIT: I have also tried with Mozila firefox and Google chrome, same issue, responding very slow.   <answer283921> I'm in the US and it's opening quickly for me.  I also tried with iTunes Connect site and that, also, is opening quickly.  It seems that whatever problem you're seeing is not on Apple's side.  <comment358047> Yea, one of my client from Russia is also saying same, but problem is here in Kolkata or may be India, may be some regional problem. <comment358048> Have you tried the usual troubleshooting methods of clearing your cache and restarting your Mac? <comment358050> Yea, Tried with all, but same issue. Thank you for your help.
