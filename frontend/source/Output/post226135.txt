Mid-2012 MacBook Pro Restarting Because of Problem After Installing <body> I installed a Samsung 850 Evo (250 GB) in my mid-2012 MacBook Pro recently. I also took out two 2 GB RAM modules and put in a single 8 GB module.  Now if I put my machine into sleep mode it will restart and give me the error message: "Your computer restarted because of a problem".  Hardware test found no problems and beyond that my computer is functioning very well. If anyone has had a similar issue or can guide me toward a fix I would be very grateful.   <comment274606> Have you checked this official page? https://support.apple.com/en-ap/HT200553 <comment274607> Do you still have the RAM you removed?  If yes then temporarily remove the new RAM and put back what you took out.  It the problem persists then it looks like an issue with the SSD and if the problem is gone then the issue is with the new RAM.  I'd do this regardless of test results, assuming you did have this issue before the hardware upgrading.  Also, how did you get the OS onto the new SSD, a clean install, restore from an image file or Time Machine, etc.? <comment274664> Good clarifications, I did a clean install and only backed up some files on a flash drive. I do still have the old RAM modules so I will try your troubleshooting method. <comment274933> BTW, In my first comment, the "assuming you did have this issue before the hardware upgrading" is missing "not" after "did". :)
