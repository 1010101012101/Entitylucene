Increasing my available storage on my iPhone <body> After I sync my iPhone 5c with my MacBook, assuming all my music had been purchased from iTunes, my iPhone should now have no music and additional storage , correct ?  <answer197349> Syncing your iOS device to iTunes will not necessarily remove music from it. You can delete it directly from the device going to Settings  General  Usage  Manage Storage (under Storage) Music, slide the first item "All Songs" to the left and press "Delete".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NnxSL.png" alt="Manage storage: Music iOS" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BgAw.png" alt="Manage storage, delete Music iOS 8"
