Can I get mac notification when a Tab has new output in iTerm2? <body> You know, iTerm2 will change the color of the tab to red or purple. But sometime when I run a long job in one tab, I have to check if it's done frequently. So.. can I get notification when there's new output in one tab? If so, how?  <answer144875> You can use Terminal Notifier. Once installed run a command like this:  precodelong-running-command &amp;&amp; terminal-notifier -message "Done" -title "Done" /code/pre  When codelong-running-command/code finishes you will get a notification.  <answer145574> To simplify the usage of the mentioned Terminal Notifier tool, you should create an emalias/em for it, including its parameters, so you don't have to type them all the time.  In your code.bashrc/code file, add an alias like this:  precodealias termnot='terminal-notifier -message "Done" -title "Done"' /code/pre  Then you can use it like this:  precodelong-running-command ; termnot /code/pre  BTW: I recommend using code;/code to separate the commands instead of code&amp;&amp;/code. code&amp;&amp;/code is a conditional operator, it will only execute the second command if the first succeeded. So if your first command failed with a non-zero exit code, you will not receive a notification. Separating them with a semicolon will ensure that the second command is always run, regardless of the first command's exit code.

Using Homebrew makes the installation as simple as  precodebrew install terminal-notifier /code/pre  <comment244240> Note the recommendation of using `;` instead of `&&` in [nwinkler response](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/145574/40482) <comment298540> You can also do `long-process && terminal-notifier -message 'Done.' || terminal-notifier -message 'Error running long-process.'` for a different message on error.
