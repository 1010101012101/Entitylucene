I plug it in and then Mac works fine and battery level is at 33%.  I googled this, found nothing.  Any idea what might be wrong ?  Battery needs replacement ?

Connect the power adapter to the Mac. On the MacBook / Pro's keyboard, hold down the kbdShift/kbd kbdControl/kbd kbdOption/kbd keys and the Power button at the same time. Release all keys and the power button at the same time â€“ the little light on the MagSafe adapter may change colors briefly to indicate the SMC has reset.  <comment307573> Did it worked ? @jhegedus <comment307576> will it reset the Mac ? @Joe I am in the middle of some coding with lot of windows open... need to wait a few hours until I can reset my Mac. <comment307578> nop ... your hard drive will not get reset.You need to save and close all windows open. <comment307581> yeah, ok I need to wait with that coz I am in the middle of some work right now, thanks for the tip ! <comment307641> i did it, now i need to see if problems happen again or not... <comment307716> did it showing that issue occurring again. <comment307718> Testing it right now.
