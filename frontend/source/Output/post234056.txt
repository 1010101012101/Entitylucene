What is the purpose of the §/± key on a UK Mac keyboard? <body> This question is just for curiosity.  My UK Macbook Pro's keyboard has a key in the very top left with the symbols § and ±. (On a US keyboard the ~/` key is in this position.)  These symbols seem quite obscure and rarely used. § is an old-fashioned symbol for a section heading in a document. While documents nowadays rarely include text like "see §2", I believe it's still used in the publishing industry behind the scenes. But even in that specialised application, I would have thought that the paragraph mark ¶ would be typed much more often than the section heading mark §, so it seems weird to have a § key and not a ¶ key.   Similarly, the plus-minus sign ± is quite specialised. You might use it often if you are writing a scientific paper with lots of uncertain measurements or a high-school math paper using the quadratic formula, but in those cases it's not clear that ± would be the symbol you need a special key for, rather than ≈, Δ, √ or any number of other symbols.  It seems odd to have a dedicated key for these relatively obscure symbols, especially since it doesn't appear on the Apple US keyboard layout, or on a non-Apple UK keyboard.   So basically I'm just curious about the reason for this key's existence. Do other British Mac users have a reason to use these symbols often, or is there some known historical reason for the decision to include it? I'd appreciate answers that stick to emspecific known facts/em about the reason for the key's inclusion (if such facts are known outside of Apple), rather than speculations.  <answer234092> I think only Apple knows the answer to this.  A much bigger mystery is why the Apple British keyboard puts the " and @ characters at different places than any normal British keyboard does.  They have had to provide a "British PC" option in system preferences/keyboard/input sources to accommodate all the folks who are used to the British standard.  The § and ± characters are available on the US keyboard at option 6 and option-shift =.  <comment286076> Possible duplicate of [What is the meaning of the "§" symbol (on the upper left corner of the mac keyboard)?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/176968/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-symbol-on-the-upper-left-corner-of-the-mac-keybo) <comment286077> @klanomath I hadn't seen that question but it's not a duplicate. I know what the symbols mean - I'm asking for the reason for the key being included in the layout, given that they are quite rare. (And in the case of §, pretty much archaic - I associate it with dusty bound volumes of old periodicals, not modern computer documents). This is not addressed in the other question or its answers. <comment286140> If I ever find myself in a lift with Tim Cook, this is the question I'm going to ask him. <comment323727> This deserves it's own question.
