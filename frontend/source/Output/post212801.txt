iTunes not recognizing my iPod touch! (Wierd Glitch) <body> Well, I am using a jailbroken iPod touch 6g and the iTunes isn't recognizing it!  I have tried ever single alternative i could find on internet but had no luck!  The weird part is that whenever i connect the iPod touch to my PC it gets considered as a removable disc but when i turn off the ipod.......just for a split second, my iTunes recognizes my iPod and the again after i turn it on, it gets recognized as an removable disc!  Any solution to this???  I have to restore my iPod....any other way i can find around restoring my iPod?  <comment256944> can you go to a dfu mode or a safe mode ? what are the things you've tried ? <comment257340> I go to recovery mode but iTunes doesnt recognise my ipod <comment257349> sometime windows doesn't load the correct driver for iDevices on recovery mode, iTunes won't be able to recognize your iPod. Try the same procedure on a mac (from a friend, or use one of the mac devices displayed in an Apple Store if it's near your) <comment257425> Yea...ill give it a try :) Thanks for the advice.....ill have to end up restoring and rejailbreaking! <comment257525> It worked....thanks mate <comment257704> happy to help :)
