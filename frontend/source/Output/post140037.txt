iMovie update stuck with phantom app <body> when I updated iMovie back on July 7, I had an error where it kept continuously saying that I had an update, but what it kept doing was installing the same update over and over. At one point I had two iMovie updates going through with one installing and one downloading. Finally it quit, but I was now stuck with this phantom app that does not allow for me to get rid of. Holding option allows for the x to come up to delete, and you can make sure that you want to delete it, but after following the prompt it just sits there allowing for you to go through it again.  I am wondering if anyone knows how to get rid of this because it is quite annoying to just see it hanging there.  More info: Was on Mavericks when it happened, have moved to the strong10.10 beta/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uE7WG.png" alt="iMovie update that won&#39;t install or delete"  <answer140041> Try resetting Launchpad's list of applications.
