iOS location based reminders not working accurately <body> I created a location based reminder to notify me when I leave my house. However, the notification does not pop-up until I am about five miles away. What do I need to do to have the notification pop-up immediately after I leave the house? I am running iOS 9.  <answer238786> When you get to the view where you can see the map and have selected codeWhen I Leave/code you can pinch and zoom to set the radius of where the notification will be triggered.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAD7h.jpg" alt="mapView pinch to zoom and change notification radius"
