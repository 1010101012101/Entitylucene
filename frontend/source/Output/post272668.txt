Sandboxing solutions for security? <body> Are there any good Mac sandboxing options available?  I'm looking for something similar to https://sandboxie.com/ for Windows.  Essentially I just want to be able to run applications in a Sandboxed mode that doesn't persist to the hard drive when it is done to help prevent malware.  <comment342718> I feel like this could be answered better at http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/
