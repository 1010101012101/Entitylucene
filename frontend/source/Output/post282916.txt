Apple ID Not Working To Reset Password <body> My laptop wasn't charging for a while, so I forgot the password for it. I went to log back in, and when I remembered I forgot the password, I went to reset it with my apple id, all the info was correct, I even changed the pass and email used, but it still wasn't working. I'm not sure what to do. I have a Mac Book Air.  <answer282920> You can reset your user password directly from your MacBook Air.  strongResetting password from Recovery Mode/strong  To reset your password from Recovery Mode, follow these steps:  ol liPower off your Mac/li liBoot into Recovery Mode by pressing the power button while holding down kbdCommand/kbdkbdR/kbd/li liIf prompted, select your language and press kbdenter/kbd/li liChoose Utilities  Terminal./li liEnter resetpassword (all one word, lowercase letters)/li liPress kbdReturn/kbd/li liSelect the drive with your account (typically the main drive)/li liChoose your account using Select the User Account./li liEnter a new password /li liRe-enter the same password/li liEnter a password hint/li liClick Save /li liIgnore the warning about the password changing/li liClick OK./li liShutdown the Mac using Apple  Shut Down/li liRestart the Mac normally and use the new password to log into your account/li /ol  Let me know how you go or if I misunderstood your question.
