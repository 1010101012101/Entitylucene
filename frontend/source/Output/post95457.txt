Find out type of VPN connections in network preference <body> I have a VPN connection in my system preference but I don't remember type of this connection (PPTP, IPSec etc). How do I find this out?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFkc5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer95463> Each kind will look slightly different in the Network System Preference Pane. Your "Home" connection appears to be PPTP. See below images for reference...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ssp6w.png" alt="L2TP" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jsCx4.png" alt="PPTP" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a8jEk.png" alt="IPSEC"  <comment111970> Netstat could tell you that <comment111971> That's a good way of finding it out!
