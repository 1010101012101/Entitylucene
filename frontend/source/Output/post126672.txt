Some TV shows repeatedly sync to iPad <body> I've got numerous TV shows on my iPad that are in dual HD/SD resolutions. The shows get there through a process of:  ol lirecord on TiVo/li litransfer, encode in HD and SD resolutions, and add to iTunes on Mac Mini using cTiVo/li licopy to iTunes on MBP over WiFi using  drag (to get both versions) from Mac Mini iTunes/li lisync to iPad ("prefer SD" is not checked)/li /ol  This works well but there's one annoying issue. When I sync with my iPad, roughly 90% of the HD/SD shows sync every time. The only issue it really creates is that the sync takes significantly longer since the show total multiple GB's. I can't see any difference between the HD-SD shows that repeatedly sync and those that don't.  Current versions of everything. 2012 Mac Mini, 2012 MPB, iPad Retina Mini  Any ideas?
