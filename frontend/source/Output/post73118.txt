Can I play chess on my Mac from the command line? <body> If I were feeling insufficiently geekish on any particular day, and thus found the GUI Chess App to lack an appropriate amount of tech credibility, is there a way to play chess on my Mac from the command line?  <answer73121> Yes! The OS X Chess app relies on the sjeng engine, which has a command line version. Type code/Applications/Chess.app/Contents/Resources/sjeng.ChessEngine/code and press enter to play:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7KSiN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Make moves with the coordinates of the origin and destination you want: codee1e4/code moves the piece at e1 to e4.  Sjeng doesn't take any command line arguments, but you can edit the config file (stored in code/Applications/Chess.app/Contents/Resources/sjeng.rc/code). This will probably mess with your settings in the GUI Chess app; make a backup before editing.  <comment84889> With or without AI? And are you just gonna keep pieces position memorized? <comment86323> It's worth noting that running this app may create files such as "bug_LE.lrn", "losers_LE.lrn", "standard_LE.lrn", and "suicide_LE.lrn" on your system. These files are safe to delete.
