Why is the symlink I created inside an application container to allow for external storage not working? <body> I was trying to get around Vemedio's Instacast limitation on storage location by symlinking (codeln -s/code) the Episodes folder in code~Library/Containers/com.vemedio.osx.Instacast/Data/Documents/Instacast/code to another location on another drive (which is actually internal in my Mac Pro for what it is worth...). I am wondering if Apple's sandboxing is preventing this to work... Once I open Instacast, none of the previously downloaded episodes are marked as available locally and if I try to redownload one, it seems to download the file in the background but never makes it available... Any idea?  <answer162486> For some reason, symlinking ema part of/em the folder inside of the codeContainers/code folder doesn't work. If you want to symlink, you have to symlink the strongwhole/strong folder, i.e. com.vemedio.osx.Instacast  See https://snipt.net/certainlyakey/os-x-sandboxed-apps-and-symlinks-problem-solution/ for reference.  <comment116600> what symlink command path are you using for the other drive exactly (anonymize if you must but include important stuff)? <comment116617> `ln -s /Volumes/BigOne/Podcasts/Episodes` while I am in `/Users/kheldar/Library/Containers/com.vemedio.osx.Instacast/Data/Documents/Instacast` <comment116642> Have you tried killing the link and simply creating an alias in finder instead?  Some programs only resolve one or the other depending on implementation. <comment117104> After you make the link (but before launching Instacast), does the link work? That is, if you put a text file in the folder, can you see it in both places? <comment117391> Yes the link works I can cd into the link and I can copy things from one to the other. However, Instacast does not see any of the linked files, which tells me it is looking for a specific file ID which I deleted when I changed the folder into a symlink... WHat do you think?
