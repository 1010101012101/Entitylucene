Restore Podcast Layout in iTunes 12.4 <body> My Macbook Pro just updated its iTunes to 12.4, and now I cannot figure out how to navigate my Podcasts. In the previous version, I had a list of Podcasts in the sidebar, and I could select one to see a list of all current and previous episodes. Now all I see is "Most Recent" and everything is jumbled together in one list.  Is there a way to restore the previous behavior of listing the Podcasts individually?

Then you can switch between unplayed/feed tabs in the right column to see all episodes or just the unplayed ones.  Depending on the defaults the view might be reduced to a text-only list.  Edit including comment from @JosephLeedy:  In order to obtain the three column view similar to the old look, after clicking on "Podcasts," you have to go to codeView/code  codeView Options/code in the menu (or press kbd⌘J/kbd) and change codeView As/code from codeClassic List/code to codeList/code.  <comment292657> I saw that list, but it is extremely hard to read on a small screen. I just want to get the old layout back if that is possible. I might have to find a way to downgrade iTunes... <comment292664> After clicking on "Podcasts," you have to go to `View  View Options` (or press kbd⌘J/kbd) and change "View As" from "Classic List" to "List". Thanks! <comment293080> @JosephLeedy I came here because I had the same problem, and your comment above solved it for me.  You should post it as an answer to your own question. <comment293161> @mweiss Thanks! Originally it was an answer, but then I deleted it and made it a comment so that I could give Josef Legény the "accept".
