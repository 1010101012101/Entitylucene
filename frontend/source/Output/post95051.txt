How to stream window or area of main display to external display? <body> I found two expensive (500$ and 200$) solutions from Telestream: Wirecast and Ustream Producer. Is there a cheaper way to do it? Is it possible with ffmpeg &amp; friends? Any hints are welcome.  Best regards Zolt√°n  P.S. I use a MB-Pro Retina + VGA-Display (Projector)  <comment111647> Have you considered an Apple TV and Airplay?
