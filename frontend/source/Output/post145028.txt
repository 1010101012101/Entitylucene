Mac OS X Mavericks Setup file Retrieve <body> Is there any possibility of getting the codeOS X Mavericks/code installation file after codeOS X Mavericks/code is installed? I need to use it on another macbook.  Or is there anyway to retrieve it?  <answer145038> If the app itself was lost, you can always re-download it from the App Store. For installing on a second computer, I'd make a flash drive version of the install. You can follow this guide for creating the flash drive install from this guide.
