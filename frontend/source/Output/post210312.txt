Openssl on mac -In is not working <body> I am follow a tutorial guide from this link http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/30/encrypt-and-decrypt-files-with-openssl/  to try to produce -sha256 hash from an input file but when i type  codeopenssl dgst -sha256 -in filename.txt/code  the command will return unknown option '-in'.  Can anyone please point out what have i gone wrong ?  OS Version: 10.11 OpenSSL Version: 1.0.2.d  <answer210315> I don't get any errors when I make a temporary file:  precodeopenssl version &gt; /$TMPDIR/foo openssl dgst -sha256 /$TMPDIR/foo /code/pre  My version is strongOpenSSL 0.9.8zg 14 July 2015/strong and the sha256 of the resulting foo file is   precodeSHA256(/tmp/foo)= 34ff579703733495dc5b883f288b71653653c8b449da860a1b6fb382fde1a5f1 /code/pre  Maybe you just need to remove the code-in/code to calculate your digest?  <comment253807> Since Apple is changing systems - could you edit in what version of OS X you have and also what `which openssl` and `openssl version` report when you run them from the command line? <comment253816> Appreciate for your respond bmike. Here is another 2 question hope you can answer that. Q1: Do you know how to output the SHA256 hash value to a text file that you have produce above to text file? cause -out apparently is not working in my case. Q2: If I just copy and paste the SHA256 hash to a text file manually, will that be any different if I just using the step from Q1 ? <comment253900> @who `openssl dgst -sha256 foo  filename_digest.txt` will work better than copy paste IMO.
