Removing computer name from terminal <body> Right now, this is what my Terminal shows:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeMyName's-MacBookPro:location MyName$ /code/pre  I'd like for it to only show my name, so something like this:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeMyName$ /code/pre  When I browsed online for a solution, they said to edit my code.bashrc/code file. I added the following line to my code.bashrc/code:   precodeexport PS1="\u$ " /code/pre  but there hasn't been any change, even after restarting Terminal.  This is the current contents of my code.bashrc/code file:  precodeexport PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting export PS1="\u$ " /code/pre  <answer192733> Two easy options:  ul liMove your changes from code.bashrc/code to code.bash_profile/code (and delete code.bashrc/code)/li liAdd a line codesource ~/.bashrc/code to code~/.bash_profile/code to make sure code.bashrc/code is read during shell startup/li /ul  <comment229454> While this will work, I'd suggest putting `source ~/.bashrc` into `.bash_profile` and then using `.bashrc` as normal. Don't know why the Bash shipped with OSX doesn't read `.bashrc` itself. <comment229457> Apple will undoubtedly replace bash in the next few years anyway since they will never use the latest GPLv3 version of bash (they don't use anything licensed under GPLv3). There hasn't been much innovation or improvement in OS X's bash in a very long time. <comment229459> Zsh is completely up to date on OS X though, and has some interesting features. I'd personally recommend that anyone bored with their shell should look into it. Plus: http://ohmyz.sh <comment229478> @DavidLord because the terminal running a shell is the first time OS X runs a shell and so should be a login shell (Under X11 the login shell runs and starts X11 and so the terminal are run as subshells of the login shell - I wonder if systemd use  will chnage this) <comment229484> Thanks a lot, that worked!  @DavidLord, what exactly do you mean by "putting `source ~/.bashrc` into `.bash_profile`"? This sounds like a better way to do it.
