How can I force iPod Nano (7th) to play 4:3 video without zooming? <body> Currently, I'm attempting to watch a video that I have in 4:3 aspect ratio. I've tried messing with the aspect ratio in Handbrake's picture settings but it always seems to zoom to what I'm guessing must be the height (given that the image is cropped at the top and the bottom). Is there a way to add left and right letterboxes to a 4:3 video to fool the iPod into thinking it's playing a 16:9 video?
