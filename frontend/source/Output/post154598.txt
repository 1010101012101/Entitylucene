Can't establish a ssh connection to my Mac OSX Yosemite <body> I'm having a   precodessh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host /code/pre  error when trying to ssh into my mac, from a linux VM  if I try with the verbose option I get this  precodessh mac-user@192.168.1.11 -v OpenSSH_6.6.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 19: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to 192.168.1.11 [192.168.1.11] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /home/linux-user/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/linux-user/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/linux-user/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/linux-user/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/linux-user/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/linux-user/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/linux-user/.ssh/id_ed25519 type -1 debug1: identity file /home/linux-user/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert type -1 debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2 /code/pre  I don't know what could be wrong, firewall options are ok.   Searching the web I found a temporary solution, disabling the "remote session" option and then using this command:  precodesudo $(which sshd) -Dd /code/pre  Don't think its a propper answer.  This problem started when updating to Yosemite OSX.  Apreciate the help.  <answer154691> I had the same problem. I deleted everything from SystemPrefereces-Security-Firewall and removed all services from SystemPreferences-Shared. Then I enabled remote login again. That fixed the problem in my case.  <answer154783> config.vm.boot_timeout - The time in seconds that Vagrant will wait for the machine to boot and be accessible. By default this is 300 seconds. (got this from) ServerFaqs  I'd increase this until you are able to vagrant ssh in.  <answer169761> I solved this using brew to install codeopenssh/code. Then change code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist/code file to use codesshd/code provided by brew. A better explanation is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10658950/upgrade-openssh-on-os-x-with-homebrew-for-pci-compliance  <comment182254> I deactivated the firewall but the problem persisted... <comment182255> sorry the link you gave me doesn't seem to have the answer, and not really sure what you mean by vagrant. I had no problems with this until the Yosimite update.
