Advice for troubleshooting hard freezes associated with Safari? (Mid 2012 Retina Macbook Pro, 10.10.2) <body> I have a Macbook Pro 10,1 (Mid 2012) running 10.10.2. Over the last few months, I have had issues with the system suddenly hanging - mouse won't move, keyboard does nothing, and the clock is stopped. I have to hold down the power button and restart the computer when this happens.  I have been experiencing these freezes ranging from daily to weekly. There is no consistent action that reproduces the freeze on demand. At some point in the last few months, though, I did switch to Safari from Chrome as my primary browser because the battery life seems so much better when using Safari. I've been doing a project over the last week that is dependent on Chrome, and as such haven't been using Safari, and have had no freezes. In retrospect, I think the freezes began happening when I started using Safari regularly.  I'd prefer to not have to choose between using Safari and having a stable system. Is anyone aware of issues like the one I'm experiencing? Any suggestions for further troubleshooting?  Edit 5/28/15:  I saved Console logs surrounding one of these freezes. When the computer froze, Safari was the frontmost app, and I was scrolling a page with 2-finger scroll on the trackpad. I then manually held down power to reboot.  precode5/28/15 7:17:00.130 PM sharingd[367]: 19:17:00.130 : SDActivityAdvertiser::continuity:didFailToStartAdvertisingOfType:withError: Activity (The operation couldn’t be completed.

I can tell that you'll see it more when you work with Safari, and uses HTTPS pages, or just has 5-6 pages opened at a time.  Hope that this can help someone to think about a solution, I've about using Firefox to see if the issue persist or not, to isolate the issue for Safari.
