How to download video from download link on iPad/iPhone <body> On my iPad I received an email with an url of a video file that is stored online (public access).  I am able to watch that video on my iPad without any problem.  My Question: HOW do I download that video to my Photos app on my iPad?  <comment188528> have you tried any app that download videos? <comment188548> Yes i did. Howeverâ€¦ downloads are stored in the app.  I want the video to be stored in the Photo app itself.  Do you have a suggestion for an iOS app that does that?
