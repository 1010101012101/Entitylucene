How do I install MacVim? <body> How do I install MacVim on Mountain Lion?  I want to get the MacVim application, as well as the new command-line vim.  I see there are several ways to do it (a snapshot from Google Code, via Homebrew), and if I use Homebrew, I see multiple options.  What way will work best both for using the native application as well as using vim on the command line?  <answer59378> It's pretty straightforward, just download the latest snapshot from GitHub and follow the instructions in the readme.txt  <answer59568> Here is the procedure I recommend, for those who are comfortable with the command-line and with Homebrew:  Install Homebrew.  Run the following on the command line (in Terminal):  precodebrew install macvim --with-override-system-vim brew linkapps /code/pre  Edit your shell startup files to ensure that code/usr/local/bin/code comes first in your code$PATH/code.  If you use vim as code$VISUAL/code or code$EDITOR/code, add `export VISUAL='mvim -f' to your environment (details).  Check that you installed everything correctly by running  precodebrew doctor /code/pre  Now, you can run the graphical MacVim on a file by running codemvim foo.txt/code from the command-line.  Or, you can run the text-based editor by running codevim foo.txt/code.  Also, if other programs (e.g., git) fork off a separate editor, they'll run the graphical MacVim.

They're always compiled against the last version of OS X (I mean, I don't recompile the old snapshots to newer OS, but the current snapshot is always compiled against the current OS). Of course, you can also download the source and compile yourself or use homebrew as the accepted answer states.
