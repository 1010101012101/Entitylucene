Changing the title of an ssh connection without modifying remote machines <body> Is it possible to set the title of an ssh connection by just changing something on my local machine?  I mean I want codeubuntu@ip-10-50-10-152/code in the following picture to be changed to a name I like.   And I don't want to change any settings on the remote machine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/efcSq.png" alt="enter image description here"  The IP address is difficult to remember, how can I change it to a more readable name?  I want to map each IP address to a different name.  The remote machines in my case are lots of Amazon EC2 instances. Some of them only exist for a few days. And new codeec2/codes get created frequently.  I use iTerm2 as my macOS terminal. And I couldn't find any plugin that does the thing I want.  Or is there a better ssh management tool that can display custom text on the title of an ssh connection?  <answer284665> Add the following to your code~/.ssh/config/code:  precodeHost yourname     HostName server.example.com     Port 22     User root /code/pre  Then use codessh yourname/code and ‘yourname’ will be shown in the title bar.  <answer284687> The best way (IMO) is to set the necessary variables in your codebash_profile/code of your remote machine.  I understand you don't want to emmodify/em anything on your remote but it's important to note that what you are doing is setting the environment variable codePROMPT_COMMAND/code  When logged in to your remote, issue the command codeecho $HOSTNAME/code and codeecho $PROMPT_COMMAND/code.  More than likely, you will get the hostname of your machine and the second will come up blank meaning that it's unset.    h3Setting the Title/h3  Edit your code.bash_profile/code found in your home directory on the remote. This is emyour/em file and will not affect the rest of the system.  Add the following line:  precodePROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${HOSTNAME}\007"' /code/pre  The code\033]0;/code (codeEsc 0;/code) is the escape code to set the title.  The code${HOSTNAME}/code is the name of your machine.    Save your profile, log out and log back in and your title bar should now reflect your hostname.  h3Connecting via hostname vs IP/h3  There are two ways to do this:  ul liSet the hostname in DNS/li limodify your local code/etc/hosts/code file/li /ul  I prefer to set this in DNS so that the name will be available to all computers across your network.  Going under the assumption that you have a "consumer grade" router (like Linksys or Netgear), you just have to add the hostname to your DHCP static lease (see your router documentation for specifics)  If you're on a corporate network, the Network Admin can add a record to the DNS server pointing to your host.  If those two options aren't available, you can simply edit your local code/etc/hosts/code file (need coderoot/code permissions.  Below is my code/etc/hosts/code used as an example:  precode127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost 192.168.10.22   fatjoe /code/pre  I added the hostname codefatjoe/code to the end of the codehosts/code file.  When I save and exit, if I type codeping fatjoe/code it immediately begins to ping the correct IP - the change is immediate.  <comment358955> No, this method doesn't work on my machine. <comment358956> 'youname' only appears in the title bar during the establishment of the ssh connection. <comment358957> After the connection is established, it changes back to ubuntu@ip-XX-XX-XX-XX <comment358958> @Brian Strange, it works for me, I have ~10 entries in ssh config like this and it works for me both in Terminal and iTerm. <comment358960> There must be something else that affects the title of the tab. <comment359092> I found that editing `/etc/hostname` on the remote machine works for me. The remote machine is Ubuntu 14.04.   It's strange that editing `/etc/hosts` doesn't work in my case. <comment359093> I still wish there's a method that doesn't require any modifications on the remote machine. Windows ssh client, such as Xshell, is able to do this. I just migrated from windows to mac. <comment359121> When you are on the remote machine, what does the command `hostname` give you (before you edit the `/etc/hostname` file)?  As far as it being a Windows/Mac thing, it sounds like Xshell was "bodging" this together.  In all my years of working with BSD/Solaris/Windows/Mac, I always set this info on the remote - so it was the same everywhere.
