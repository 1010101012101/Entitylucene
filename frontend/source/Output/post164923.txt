rMBP kernel_task spikes when connecting more than one external monitor <body> When connecting a second external monitor kernel_task spikes to 600%+. This makes the computer unusable.  Before Yosemite, this worked fine with 3 monitors.  Here are the specifics:   ul liWhen I connect one monitor to either DP or HDMI things work fine./li liWhen I connect a second monitor with either DP or HDMI kernel_task spikes./li liWhen I disconnect either the DP or HDMI emsometimes/em the kernel_task rapidly returns to normal levels./li liWhen I disconnect all monitors the kernel_task rapid returns to normal levels. (In Activity Monitor goto codeView &gt; Update Frequency &gt; Very Often/code and as soon as you disconnect the monitors, you will get lots of rapid updates to the UI)./li liOccasionally when plugging in two monitors it works (DP or HDMI) but the 3rd causes an immediate spike. After this happens, all monitors must be removed for it to return to normal. emSometimes/em removing all but one will fix it./li liSometimes when I plug all 3 in it takes 3 mins+ for it to occur./li /ul  What I have tried:  ul liResetting NVRAM./li liResetting SMC./li liAttempting the above scenario with power adapter plugged in and running on battery./li liDisabling "Automatic Graphics Switching" in Energy Saver./li liUsing integrated graphics by using codesudo pmset -c gpuswitch 0/code/li /ul  emNOTE: When trying some of these things sometimes it takes 1min to happen./em  System config:  I am running a MacBook Pro Retina 2.7Ghz i7 (Macbook10,1 / Mid 2012) running Yosemite 10.10.1.  I have 3 external monitors (Dell 2415H) with 2 connected by Display Port and 1 with the HDMI.  hr  I think the issue has to do with power management. Whenever my CPU hits 58 degrees it seems to occur. I just left my 3 monitors plugged in for 5+ mins and it didn't happen. But when I started searching using Chrome it immediately happened.  Looks like a good fix here: http://www.rdoxenham.com/?p=259  <answer164947> According to Rhys Oxenhams:     the kernel will keep looping some very simple tasks, e.g. getting the date,    therefore ‘consuming’ (with the highest priority) the majority of the CPU in a    bid to cool the system down.   The solution he mentions on his blog should work for earlier Macs. For Ivy-Bridge Macs and a little earlier Richard Schwarting has found the appropriate file to disable. Instructions are included below for convenience. I have tried many things, but this works.  ol liDisable kext by renaming it  precodecd /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/Plugins sudo mv X86PlatformShim.kext X86PlatformShim.kext.disabled /code/pre/li liClear kext cache (not sure if this is needed)  precodesudo touch /System/Library/Extensions/ /code/pre/li liRestart  precodesudo reboot /code/pre/li /ol  hr  ul liAfter installing OSX updates you may need to repeat the above procedure if the updates have re-created the codekext/code./li /ul  <comment193404> beside of CPU what other task goes up in activity? <comment193425> Nothing, just kernel_task. <comment197033> 2 weeks later this has still resolved the issue. But I have also disabled `Settings  Mission Control  Separate spaces for displays` which stops the lag from focusing windows on different displays. <comment241919> THANK you for posting this answer. I work on 3 monitors (same idea 2 DP 1 HDMI) and have to unplug my HDMI every day after about 10 minutes of use. Sometimes i'll get lucky and have a few hours, but anytime I play media (music, videos, etc) it'll spike and need to be disconnected. <comment294621> Even with sudo getting `mv: rename X86PlatformShim.kext to X86PlatformShim.kext.disabled: Operation not permitted` when trying to move... <comment297948> @Shwaydogg You probably need to disable OSX SIP. See http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/ <comment299831> This is the correct answer. Why this question is marked as duplicate and says it already has an answer is crazy to me. Thanks so much for looking into the help. <comment304951> I can't thank you enough for this! I'd written off being able to use my old 27inch imac with my macbook pro. I had to disable SIP but it works perfectly. <comment304953> @opsb Cheers! Also, make sure you keep your graphics card cool. GeForce cards have built-in temperature-sensitive processor speed throttling which is impossible to disable. I highly recommend: https://www.bresink.com/osx/HardwareMonitor.html for monitoring the temps with graphs. I have a small $20 desk fan pointed at the left-top of my mid-2012 rMBP at all times. Otherwise, I see big performance issues with 2 external monitors. <comment305134> I'm in Barcelona so I do have a fan running constantly anyway just to keep me fresh ;) Haven't noticed any spikes apart from when I'm using hangouts, I just detach the extra screen while I'm on a call. <comment305626> This seems to have worked for me.  I will add that I use a Logitech mouse, and I had to reinstall it's drivers to get the scroll wheel to work again. <comment305627> @bheussler Interesting. I use an IntelliMouse Explorer from the 90s and I had to reinstall its drivers as well, but I never thought about the link to this kext. <comment310586> Just following up.  I just had kernal_task spike out of control again.  Everything seemed to be fixed and working fine for a month.  I wonder if I applied an update and have to disable kext again?  Or maybe this was temperature related?  I'll try to keep you guys up to date. <comment310642> @bheussler After each OSX update, it seems to restore the kext so you will probably have to perform fix again. <comment310728> @vauhan Thank you for the response!  Maybe it's worth adding a note to the bottom of the answer. <comment322760> Update: I am running Sierra and I'm having issues with the kernal_task again.  This solution is not enough anymore. <comment333667> Same here. The solution didn't work for Sierra. Even after renaming and restarting, kernel_task went back to using 500% CPU. <comment341314> I depends what Macbook you have. This works on my MBP Mid-2012 with NVidia graphics. It won't work for other laptops. I am using MBP 2016 with Sierra and no longer encounter these issues. <comment349141> The solution works, but so much as an iTunes update and my MBP is back to being nearly unusable due to that issue. There simply has to be a better solution. <comment370494> I can confirm that this works on macOS High Sierra beta 3... in fact, in my case, I didn't even need to restart. <comment370926> I get `mv: rename X86PlatformShim.kext to X86PlatformShim.kext.disabled: Operation not permitted`. macOS Sierra.
