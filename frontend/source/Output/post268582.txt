Change the icon of all the folders on mac <body> I want to change the default folder icon to something nicer. please help  <answer268587> Most standard system wide icons for the macOS are stored here: /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources  The folder icon in which you're interested is named emGenericFolderIcon.icns/em.  If you're running Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11) or later, due to System Integrity Protection, you won't be able to modify these files.  However, if you turn off System Integrity Protection, you'll gain the ability to edit the icon files. Here're instructions:  ol liBoot into recovery mode (boot while holding down ⌘R)/li liOpen the terminal/li liType codecsrutil disable/code./li liReboot normally./li liNow edit the icon file(s)./li liRepeat steps 1–4 to re-enable System Integrity protection, except that the Terminal command you'll use is codecsrutil enable/code./li /ol  Needless to say, be very careful when turning off System Integrity Protection and editing system files. There's a lot of potential to royally screw things up when doing so.  For step 5, you'll need some sort of program that can edit or generate emICNS/em files. Your best bet is probably to search around this site or with Google to find recommendations.

There are millions of .icns files that you can download./li liNow when you're at Step 5 of jefe2000's instructions, rename the existing emGenericFolderIcon.icns/em file to something else (e.g. OldGenericFolderIcon.icns)/li liAdd the newly downloaded icon file you want to use into the same directory and rename that file to GenericFolderIcon.icns./li liContinue on to Step 6 of jefe2000's instructions/li /ul  Finally, you may want to test how an icon will look (or you may only want to change the icon of a specific file or folder.
