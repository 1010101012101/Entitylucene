One frame of my WiFi searching animation is wrong <body> My WiFi loading animation is messed up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7fhmL.gif" alt="enter image description here"  The frame where the second-longest bar is filled doesn't match with the other frames! This is mildly infuriating â€” have I done something to mess this up or is Yosemite just like this?  <comment234480> funny. I can not reproduce this on my OS X 10.10.4. Have your tried changing your resolution? Mightbe it's some rendering feature, as every line looks blurred in that frame. <comment234481> Might be changing the position of the icon 'rebuilds' it somehow and fix it... (command drag) <comment234483> Thanks for the suggestions @CousinCocaine but neither worked :( <comment234484> Also just updated to 10.10.4 but no luck <comment235236> You could try applying the combo update instead of the incremental one. That may or may not make a difference.
