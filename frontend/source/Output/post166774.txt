Where are settings for keystrokes that rearrange size/position of active window <body> On my current (Yosemite) configuration the key combinations kbdctrl/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd | kbd→/kbd as well as those keys with kbd⇧/kbd cause the current window to be resized to one quartr screen size and placed in one of [UpperLeft|UpperRight|LowerLeft|LowerRight] quadrants.  Where are these keyboard settings defined? I want to modify or possibly disable them.  <comment195526> That's not a System functionality. You must have some 3rd party app that is doing it - SizeUp or Moom etc <comment195547> @Tetsujin  you are probably correct. I have KeyRemap4Macbook: looking into that to see if it comes from there.
