Automate change in settings upon plugging mouse in <body> I am using a MacBook Air running Sierra.  I like to use different mouse settings with my touchpad, and my USB mouse. To facilitate this, every time I plug my mouse in, I have to go to codeSystem Preferences/code and change the mouse settings (reverse scroll direction and adjust sensitivity). Is there any way by which I can automate this change (maybe using automator) in settings to occur automatically every time I plug in the USB mouse?  <answer294033> Under strongmacOS Sierra/strong, if you have only a normal strongUSB mouse/strong, not one that comes with it's own software and is multi-function with additional buttons, etc., then in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongMouse/strong, you have the following settings that can be changed:  ul listrongScroll direction: natural/strong emcheckbox/em/li listrongTracking speed/strong emslider/em/li listrongScrolling Speed/strong emslider/em/li listrongDouble-Click speed/strong emslider/em/li /ul  And two additional settings under strongMouse/strong that will not be addressed, for two reasons, the strongPrimary mouse button:/strong emradio buttons/em, if other then the emdefault/em of strongLeft/strong, is in all likelihood already set and wouldn't necessarily change because one wants to change the strongScroll direction: natural/strong emcheckbox/em, and since the OP stated strongUSB mouse/strong, I'll assume is not using strongBluetooth/strong and can ignore the strongSetup Bluetooth Mouse.../strong embutton/em.  This answer is going to use strongAppleScript/strong to get the embefore/em and emafter/em settings for the emvalue/em of the aforementioned listed emsliders/em to be used in the strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em that follows after this emcode/em.  Open strongScript Editor/strong and create a new document, then add the following emcode/em:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.mouse"     --delay 0.5 -- # If necessary, uncomment 'delay' command and set its value in seconds and or decimal fractions there of.     tell application "System Events"         log "Scrolling speed is set to: " &amp; value in (get properties of slider 1 of front window of application process "System Preferences")         log "Double-Click speed is set to: " &amp; value in (get properties of slider 2 of front window of application process "System Preferences")         log "Tracking speed is set to: " &amp; value in (get properties of slider 3 of front window of application process "System Preferences")     end tell end tell /code/pre  There will be two difference emstates/em of the strongScroll direction: natural/strong emcheckbox/em in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongMouse/strong, emchecked/em and emunchecked/em and the change in emslider/em settings between the two emstates/em.  The emcode/em above will be run once to get the current emvalue/em settings of the emsliders/em. Then make the setting changes that you want to the emsliders/em for the opposite emstate/em of what it was when you gathered the emvalues/em of the first settings for the first emstate/em. Then run the emcode/em again to get the differential settings.  You will then plug in the emvalues/em, gathered above, in the emcode/em below. You can emcomment/em out or remove any emslider/em that's not going to be changed by the emcode/em below.  The emcomments/em in the emcode/em below should be adequate, however, don't hesitate to ask it you need anything explained.  I saved the following strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em in strongScript Editor/strong as an application named strongToggle Mouse Settings/strong in the strongApplications/strong folder.  When run, it toggles the emstate/em of the strongScroll direction: natural/strong emcheckbox/em between emchecked/em and emunchecked/em along with the emslider/em settings under each emstate/em.  strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em for the strongToggle Mouse Settings/strong app:  precodeon run     try         tell application "System Preferences"             set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.mouse"             -- delay 0.5    -- # If necessary, uncomment 'delay' command and set its value in seconds and or decimal fractions there of.             tell application "System Events"                 set isChecked to get value of checkbox 1 of front window of application process "System Preferences" as boolean                 if isChecked then                     --  # The 'Scroll direction: Natural' checkbox is checked, uncheck it.                     set cbValue to value of (click checkbox 1 of front window of application process "System Preferences") as boolean                     --  # Scrolling Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 8.0                     set value of slider 1 of front window of application process "System Preferences" to 6.0                     --  # Double-Click Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 10.0                     set value of slider 2 of front window of application process "System Preferences" to 8.0                     --  # Tracking Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 9.0                     set value of slider 3 of front window of application process "System Preferences" to 6.0                 else                     --  # The 'Scroll direction: Natural' checkbox is not checked, check it.                     set cbValue to value of (click checkbox 1 of front window of application process "System Preferences") as boolean                     --  # Scrolling Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 8.0                     set value of slider 1 of front window of application process "System Preferences" to 4.5                     --  # Double-Click Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 10.0                     set value of slider 2 of front window of application process "System Preferences" to 8.0                     --  # Tracking Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 9.0                     set value of slider 3 of front window of application process "System Preferences" to 4.0                 end if             end tell             tell me                 if cbValue then                     display notification "Natural scrolling is now active." with title (name of me)                 else                     display notification "Natural scrolling is no longer active." with title (name of me)                 end if             end tell             quit         end tell     on error eStr number eNum         activate         display dialog eStr &amp; " number " &amp; eNum buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Toggle Mouse Settings" with icon caution         tell application "System Preferences" to quit         return     end try end run /code/pre  strongNote:/strong Before running the strongToggle Mouse Settings/strong app, you'll need to add it to: strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongPrivacy/strong  strongAccessibility/strong  hr  There is an app called EventScripts that could be used to trigger when a USB device is plugged in and or removed. I have not used it before, just aware it exists.  There is also an app called Scroll Reverser. I have not used it before, just aware it exists.
