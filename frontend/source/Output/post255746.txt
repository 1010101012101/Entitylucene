How to attach Proxy-Authorization in Request Header while using Auto-Config Pac File on an iOS Device? <body> For example I have a codehttp://localhost:8080/proxy.pac/code in which returns:  precodefunction FindProxyForURL(url, host) {   return 'HTTPS localhost:443'; } /code/pre  And the request should be verified via username and password OR the basic authorization. But iOS does not prompt for credential. How do I attach credential info?
