I can't download free apps <body> I am trying to update/download apps, and when I do it, it says:     There's a billing problem with a previous purchase. Please update your payment method.   I updated my payment method, but it still doesn't let me download apps. I bought a paid app that I HAD MONEY FOR, and I got the app. It didn't take the money until today, after I USED the rest of the money on the card. So now I do not have enough money on the card to pay for the app. I deleted the app off of my phone, but I still can not download free apps. Please help.
