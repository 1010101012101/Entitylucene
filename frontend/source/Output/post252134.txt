dot-app wrapper for Windows programs <body> Several months ago, I was interested in a Windows program "Azuon."  They had instructions on how to install it on Mac OS by getting a "wrapper" from somewhere else.  Sort of like WINE or CrossOver but it put everything needed inside the .app bundle.

Have to use a utility program to install the DLL, but it's not always obvious which option on the util is the one needed.  First time, I got it right, but then Mono had an unhanded exception.  Second time, loading a different DLL (and I'm certain it was the right one) still complained it couldn't open it.  Obviously Azuon got it to work, but ....
