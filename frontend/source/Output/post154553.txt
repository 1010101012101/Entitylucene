safari to open external links in new window <body> I like safari to open links in new emtabs/em in general. I.e. when I do a search, I want results I click to open in new tabs in the same window. This allows to have multiple windows with multiple tabs and have them grouped by topic.  when I click on a link i an email, safari (on OS X) somehow (randomly?) chooses an open window and opens the link as a new tab in it. sometime it picks even a minimised window, although there are others visible on the same space.  to be clear: I want the new window when the action is triggered from external application (e.g. Mail, etc.). Within Safari I'd like to stick with the default behaviour.  I tried the Safari Settings - Tabs - Open new pages in tabs instead of windows setting (all of them), but this does not give the expected result. it is general for all. Also google did not know a satisfying answer, so I am asking here.  Any help is appreciated.  <answer154557> I've experienced the same thing, new windows instead of tabs opening when control clicking, and it has seemed totally random to me, too.   The Safari Extension 'Link Thing' (maybe 'LinkThing' -?) will, by default, open all links in a new tab without your having to hit control unless the page (e.g. DuckDuckGo) disables and overrides the user's browser preferences.   <comment191072> I want the same. Alas, Safari and Firefox think it's a good idea to hijack existing windows for creating unrelated new tabs. Until now... But one day they will understand.Â :-)
