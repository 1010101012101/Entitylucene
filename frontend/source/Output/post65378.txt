How to run Excel on headless Mac? <body> I'd like to run applescript to control Excel on a headless Mac.  I want to do it from the command line via ssh, and I cannot - there is no display to run applescript on, so osascript throws an error.  I know there is on a Linux machine with X11 - I'm hoping something similar is available, but how to do this on a Mac?  <answer65409> You can use VNC to log into the mac from a client machine (iOS, android, PC, Mac) and establish the UI session, set excel to launch at boot and set the user account to automatically log in.  You also will want remote access to the computer (allowing ssh, and perhaps remote apple script) so you can use codessh/code and codeosascript/code or perhaps another Mac to script things directly from AppleScript.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g1qC2.png" alt="enter image description here"
