iTunes crashes (have to force close) when choosing Movies <body> Every time I select Movies pane on the left-hand side, iTunes crashes and I have to force quit it. I only ever had two movies in iTunes, but I don't think these are present on my hard drive any more. I have a lot of movies (avi, mkv, and mp4) in my Movies folder on my MacBook.   iTunes also crashes when going to the Movies tab when syncing with either iPhone 4S or iPad 2. When going to the Movies pane, I can see the two movies, however when syncing with iPhone it never shows me the contents of the tab, before crashing.  What do I do?
