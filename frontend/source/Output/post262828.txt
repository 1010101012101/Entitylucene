Standard Function keys using External Keyboard on 2016 Macbook Pro (touch) <body> I recently picked up a 2016 Macbook Pro (with Touch Bar). I use an external keyboard. There used to be a setting in the keyboard system preferences that "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys". That is no longer an option. Is there a way to get that back?  <answer263150> This may not apply to everyone, but in my case, I am using a Logitech Keyboard (K750). The Logitech control panel has an override to use the F-keys as standard function keys.   <answer276157> At least in Sierra 10.12.3, the emKeyboard/em panel of emSystem Preferences/em has a check box for that which says:     Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys on external keyboards      When this option is selected, press the Fn key to use the special features printed on each key   <answer293203> You can install Karabiner-Elements.  In karabiner-elements Preferences, in the Function Keys tab, there is an option at the bottom, "Use all F-keys as standard function keys"  <comment369936> In 10.12.5, it doesn't <comment369943> Yes I find the new keyboards a step down from the old ones. I've had my new (7 month) old keyboard on my 2017 MacBook replaced last week. <comment369992> Just checked 10.12.6 and I see the option <comment370020> So weird, I just saw it there, then closed and re-opened sysprefs and it was gone. Can't seem to get it back!
