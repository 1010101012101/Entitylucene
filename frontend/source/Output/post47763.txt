jDownloader-like command line tool or lightweight GUI App? <body> I use jDownloader which works great, but takes a lot of time to load and surprisingly takes a lot of time also to start and stop downloads.    I'd like to have a similar functionality* but with a command line tool or a really light-weight GUI App. em(but command line preferred)/em    * It mainly processes pages and links to known download sites and gets linked files and manages its downloads.  <answer47766> Plowshare is a command line-downloading tool for Mac OS X: http://alternativeto.net/software/plowshare/  <comment54914> Thanks for the link, other alternatives from that site might help too.
