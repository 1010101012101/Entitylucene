Hide file types in finder search <body> Does anyone know how to hide certain file types from finder and spotlight search? I get all these files that I need on my computer but I will never use. I would like to hide them to make my searches more efficient. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9nLEA.png" alt="screengrab"  <comment256092> Would an answer showing how to delimit your search *to* a specific file type be acceptable? <comment256096> No not really, I need to work fast with as little steps as possible
