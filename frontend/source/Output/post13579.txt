Codebox, or another code library manager? <body> Since I have Papers for all my documents, iTunes for my music/videos I'm only missing a good "code library manager/snippet manager" for all my pieces of code (especially for small projects or test code, as the bigger ones are easy to archives but little piece of code usually get more or less lost).  So I found Code box but there's no trial version available. I looks like it has the features I want, so something like Paper but for code.  My question is: is it worth buying it ? Would you recommend another one I could test first ?  <answer13588> Have you seen Snippets?  It's very comprehensive, easy to use and has a 30 day trial.  <answer13663> You might also consider http://www.mcubedsw.com/software/codecollectorpro.  <comment14449> Great ! From Snippets blog it looks like the guy selling Code Box just "stole" the ideas from Snippets... (http://www.snippetsapp.com/blog/snippets-whats-happening.html). I'll test Snippets, at least for 30 days then. <comment14531> +1 for CodeCollector Martin (the author) is very professional. And he has submitted to the App Store a week ago I believe, check his twitter. I don't have experience with Snippets. <comment14658> I'll have a look at that one too.
