App Exposé: Stop rearranging windows based on most recent use <body> There's an option to stop mission control from rearranging spaces based on most recent use, but it looks like there's no equivalent for doing the same to windows in App Exposé.  Whenever I swipe down to display App Exposé, my windows will be arranged in a order seemingly based on most recent use, and that will change next time if I dare select a different window than the last opened. This is very confusing when working with extremely similar windows.
