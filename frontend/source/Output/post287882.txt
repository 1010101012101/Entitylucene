PDF - Can select text, but empty lines are copied <body> Preview app allows me to select lines and words of text. However, when I copy and paste it into another app, empty characters are pasted.   For example, I select 3 rows of text and paste it, but 3 rows of empty text have been pasted.   On macOS Sierra with preview and the PDF files in question do not seem to be protected as I can both select text and choose codeEdit-&gt;Copy/code.  What is this and how I can overcome this?  For example, I wanted to copy this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z36xf.png" alt=""  and I got this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wVcWG.png" alt=""  As you can see, I did not get those weird characters that people get when copy from protected document.   <comment363464> At worst, pdf is simply a container. Are you generating the pdf? Are they commercially prepared? [This is probably intentional by the creator of the files](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61437/preview-copies-aliens-how-to-change-the-encoding-make-it-work) but more investigation or detail is needed. If you can make a short TextEdit doc and print it to pdf - you should be able to make sure your preview app and pasteboard are functioning properly. <comment363467> Also check encoding with an export of one document in question - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/129832/5472 <comment363576> @bmike The PSD is a book that you receive as PDF and portions I wanted to copy/paste are related to code examples. <comment363579> @bmike Check my edit please. I do not get those weird chars, but literary empty lines. Like keyboard space was typed 100 times. <comment363581> @bmikeThis seems to help https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/129832/9652. THANKS!
