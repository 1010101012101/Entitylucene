Connecting to Windows 7 VPN server <body> I'm attempting to setup a VPN to my home by using a Windows 7 machine as a VPN server. I've set it up the standard Windows 7 VPN which I believe uses PPTP. I've also enabled PPTP passthrough on my router.  Problem is I can't seem to connect to the VPN and I get the following errors in my system log.  precodeAug  3 10:37:18 melonade.local pppd[6215]: pppd 2.4.2 (Apple version 596.13) started by philipgoh, uid 501 Aug  3 10:37:18 melonade.local pppd[6215]: PPTP connecting to server '192.168.0.4' (192.168.0.4)...

I'm assuming that the VPN is PPTP as I set it up using these instructions. I've tried Googling but I don't find anything helpful.  <comment114827> Who is on the other site ? a osx ? <comment114837> The VPN server is running Windows 7. The VPN client is OS X. The log I attached is client side, from the OS X client attempting to connect to the VPN.
