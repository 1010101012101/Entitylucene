How can I disable pop-unders when using Chrome? <body> I know it's possible to disable pop-ups, and that's the default behavior, but It's not affecting the pop-unders.  <answer39437> h2Yes,/h2  but you need to block all scripts on a domain using Chrome's own script blocking feature.  hr  Why?  Pop-unders are usually via strongJavaScript/strong. In order to disable them, I block javascript on the specific site using delthe extension strongScriptNo/strong/del  Chrome's build-in script blocking in:  strongSettings &#x2192;  Show advanced settings &#x2192; Content settings &#x2192; JavaScript &#x2192; JavaScript Exceptions/strong  At the moment Chrome's API do not allow proper script blocking which is also why Firefox' NoScript developer has not yet ported his extension. Third-party extensions like ScriptNo suffer from the same problem.  The lack of needed API can allow scripts to still load the first time you visit a website.  By design there is no option for extensions to effectively block scripts like in Firefox, therefore the only way to stop this behavior is to emblock all scripts/em on a domain using Chrome's settings which I mentioned at the top.  <answer57267> I have tried lot of different options, addons, scripts, but sorry to disappoint you mate, none of them works perfectly. Some pop-ups do find a way to evade all such methods   <answer87244> Chrome allows you to set preferences for EACH specific site.  Click on the icon in the browser.   Opens a window allowing to set Java and so on specific to that site.  Now to the pop-unders.  I personally use the Chrommes Poper Blocker extension.  It works for me, but then I have not visited your websites.  Poper Blocker 1.69  Blocks all these annoying popups and popunders that pop no matter!

I think the use a different method for doing it. <comment54945> Have you tried a general-purpose ad-blocker? I use [AdBlockPlus for chrome](http://adblockplus.org/en/chrome) and can't remember seeing any pop-unders, though I don't browse to sites that might have them very much. <comment62247> AdBlockPlus is for you! Internet will "look different", in a pleasant way :) <comment65766> @mokalan You're right, I've radially changed my answer now. Please take another look. <comment65767> Please name a few sites that evade all methods so that I can check for myself. I'm especially interested in sites that to not use javascript to trigger pop-unders. <comment86161> Do you have a link to demonstrate this effect? I would like to take a look to see how they circumvent the blocking. <comment86392> @J.C. Try http://subtitle.co.il, use the search box to trigger the pop-under <comment101981> What is pop-under ?
