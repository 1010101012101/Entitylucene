How to restore an account from a lost mac from time machine? <body> I have 2 computers : an iMac and a MBP. My old MBP is dead. I've Time Machine backups from the accounts of this computer.  How can I restore those accounts on my iMac to have access to their data?  <answer157457> Use Migration Assistant! Should work just fine from a TM backup.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQ0t2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment185147> i've done this with command line, but it was clunky so i'm interested in what people come up with for solutions. <comment185194> Have you understood that I want to keep my current accounts on my iMac ? <comment185230> Have you tried it?
