Git stopped working after installing both Github osx client and RailsInstaller <body> Perhaps it was due to some conflict but now when typing git I get a blank line, it doesn't say command not found, just goes to the next line  If I press return, it exits, and does nothing  How do I reinstall / remove everything and start from scratch?   I'm a new mac user, so please don't assume I know anything obvious   <answer63461> I didn't find a way to uninstall the git version that railsinstaller (allegedly) installed (I could have just removed any file that starts with codegit/code in code/usr/bin/code but it doesn't seem right)  What I did was just change the system path, which I thought should be trivial  well, apparently there are quite a emfew/em places, here are a few from that answer (not in order)  precode/etc/profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_login ~/.profile    ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist /etc/paths /etc/paths.d/ /code/pre  Eventually, what helped was to change code/etc/paths/code (had to learn a bit vim to do so)  I moved code/usr/local/git/bin/code to be the first entry, above code/usr/bin/code and that was about it  <comment73343> @christianmbrodbeck I get `/usr/bin/git` which is the git installed probably by railsinstaller.  the git version I want (dmg downloaded from git-scm.com) is located at `/usr/local/git/bin`.   how do I switch the which? :) <comment73344> Which version of OS X? <comment73348> Latest, Mountain Lion I think, I resolved the issue by the way, I'll post the answer, thank you!
