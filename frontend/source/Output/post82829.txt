Applescript and Fantastical <body> I trying to add a Fantastical event with AppleScript. Aparently the Fantastical Suite is quite simple as there is only one verb.   precodeparse sentenceâ€‚v : parse sentence     parse sentence text : sentence to parse         [notes text] : Notes to add to the event or reminder         [add immediately boolean] : If true the sentence is parsed and immediately added to the calendar. /code/pre  I've managed to parse the sentence but I unable to set the codenotes/code and codeadd immediately/code parameters. Can anyone help?  <answer82836> I don't have Fantastical but does this work?  precodeparse sentence "my sentence" notes "my notes" add immediately true /code/pre  <comment95579> That does work (although the result is not what I expected in the app). Thanks
