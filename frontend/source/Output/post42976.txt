Changing User permissions - Seagate Hard Drive <body> All of a sudden, my hard drive has stopped working. I can only view its contents but can't store anything new now. I also can't change its permissions. What is the issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmppP.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iJipa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer42985> Without a third-party utility like NTFS-3G, OS X can't write to NTFS formatted hard drives. Did you reformat the disk recently or reinstall OS X?  <comment48873> No, I didn't. I might have reformatted the disk, don't remember doing so though. Didn't reinstall OS X. Any fix now? <comment48874> @HPV Get MacFUSE and NTFS-3g. <comment48880> Installed both and restarted. Got the following error. `NTFS-3G could not mount /dev/disk1s1 at /Volumes/Expansion Drive because the following problem occurred:  dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/ntfs-3g   Reason: image not found` <comment48881> Now , I can't see my hard drive in finder but here http://cl.ly/2l3312112k2c0Q013x3T <comment48884> You should ask a new question about that - it's been awhile since I used MacFUSE or NTFS-3g and I'd never gotten that error. Sorry. If you uninstall the two, will the disk mount again? <comment48891> Uninstalled, I can now see the drive in the finder like previously. <comment48947> I installed the new version of NTFS-3g only for Lion and its working. Thanks!
