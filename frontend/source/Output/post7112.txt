How can I get my trackpad settings to work on the login screen? <body> I enabled the System Preferences  Trackpad  Tap to Click which causes it to work while I am logged in. However, in the login screen, it does not work. How can I get this setting enabled in the login screen as well?  <answer7119> I think that this is impossible but I find below post (but didn't test myself)br according to fds post:  precodedefaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1 /code/pre  <answer7194> I don't know if this is still the case, but the login window's session used to be run as root. So if you enabled the root account, logged in as root, and set whatever trackpad or mouse settings you liked in System Preferences, they would be applied to the login window.  <answer7197> Open Terminal and enter the following commands  ol lidefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/li likillall Finder  /li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Low9i.png" alt="Show Files"  In Finder  ol liopen Macintosh HD/Library/Preferences/li liCtl+click/right-click a file called .GlobalPreferences.plist and click 'Get Info'/li liChange the permissions to allow you to alter it but make a note/screenshot of what they are first.

Just tested it to be sure :-) <comment7673> +1 I has the same question <comment7732> I was afraid of that. Thanks for testing. <comment8008> Did you try this or were you just wondering? <comment55205> Do none of the answers work for you?
