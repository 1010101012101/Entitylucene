Disable Ctrl-H, Ctrl-P, and other Mac keyboard shortcuts <body> On GUIs with editable text focused on Mac I cannot seem to remap kbdctrl/kbdkbdP/kbd and kbdctrl/kbdkbdH/kbd to shortcuts I want.    In IntelliJ I am trying to map my VIM ctrl shortcuts (kbdctrl/kbdkbdH/kbd next tab, kbdctrl/kbdkbdP/kbd open file).  When I hit kbdctrl/kbdkbdP/kbd I see that the "Navigate" tab highlights and the File... option is selected, but its function is overridden by moving up in the currently focused text edit window. The same problem is present with kbdctrl/kbdkbdH/kbd and trying to switch to the previous tab.  Any thoughts?   BTW, it's the same with kbdctrl/kbdkbdN/kbd and any other native text editing commands. They also do not exist in System Preferences  Keyboard anywhere.   <answer235501> OS X uses Emacs-like keybindings in most text editing windows.  Normally you would change them to another text editing function but I don't know about functions like next tab or open a file.  Those would be mapped in the System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts window from a key to a menu in the IntelliJ app.  But, if it can accept the Emacs keybindings for other functions, try customizing it yourself.  Edit the code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code file (creating the KeyBindings folder and the dict file if they don't exist) with something like this.  code{     "~d" = "deleteWordForward:";     "^w" = "deleteWordBackward:"; /code  Save/exit then quit/restart the IntelliJ app (you don't need a reboot) and see if codeOption-d/code deletes the next word and codeControl-w/code deletes previous word.  If it works, research the Emacs bindings for next tab and open file.  Good luck!
