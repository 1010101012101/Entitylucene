Edit symlinked files in Dropbox <body> I have a soft symlink between the codeDocuments/code folder on my main computer and a folder in Dropbox, say codedbDocs/code. If I now edit a document, say codethesis.tex/code, in codedbDocs/code from another computer, will the symlink on my main computer see that codethesis.tex/code has changed and sync this file back to codeDocuments/code? Or will the symlink just overwrite the newly edited file in codedbDocs/code with the corresponding file from codeDocuments/code?   <answer90818> The quick answer is that if you open codeDocuments/thesis.tex/code after editing it in your codeDropbox/code folder on another computer, you strongwill/strong see the changes. As @Mark said in a comment, a symlink is simply a pointer to another location on your computer. If that other location has its contents changed, those changes will be visible when using the symlink in codeDocuments/code, just as they would if you examined the file directly in the codeDropbox/code folder.  <comment106606> I'm not sure I got the question. Where is the actual folder and where's the symlink? <comment106617> symlinks do not sync - they are a pointer to another file, you need to make the question clearer <comment106628> Ok. So as the files in `Documents` are just pointers to `dbDocs` I'm just confusing myself with thinking about "the file on my main computer". This clarifies.
