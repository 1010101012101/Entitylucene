Something has been wrong with my finder and Mac. How to fix? <body> Finder is often unresponsive.  Also in many software, like xcode or any project. I used to be able to right click and select open in Finder. Now if I do that nothing happen.  Zip utility is much slower. Takes minutes to solve.  I think this happen since I used ccleaner or something.  How to fix?  Finder seems to be the one affected. I wonder if there is other apps with option to "open in Finder" like xcode.  <answer83017> There is a bug in 10.8.2 where occasionally revealing files in Finder stops working and Archive Utilility stops responding whenever you try to extract an archive.  As a workaround, you can terminate codeappleeventsd/code from Activity Monitor or with codesudo killall -kill appleeventsd/code. (Without -kill other processes stop responding.) The issue will probably return within a few days or hours though.  <comment95703> There is no appleeventsd in activity monitor <comment95706> Did you select the all processes view? <comment95724> Selected as the right answer :)
