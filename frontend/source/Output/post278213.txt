Why do IPv6 SSH connections time out during sleep mode but IPv4 ones don't? <body> I have a Macbook Pro using macOS 10.11.6 and I regularly SSH into various (mostly Ubuntu based) Linux servers around the world. I have noticed that when I use the IPv4 address of the servers I can close the Macbook lid - for several hours - and when it resumes I can just continue using my SSH sessions. But when I use the same server's IPv6 addresses going to sleep means having lots of   precodepacket_write_wait: Connection to x.y.z.w: Broken pipe /code/pre  messages scattered around my terminals and I have to relogin to every session (and subsequently remove stale vim swap files and whatever).  Why? What is the difference between the two protocols? Or rather, how can I find out? Are there timeout differences inherent in the protocol or is it just a configuration issue?  I am connecting from a "real IPv6" DSL connection to a "real" IPv6 server, i.e. no tunneling or VPN or anything.  <comment350083> My guess is that you are getting different IPv6 addresses for subsequent wake-ups, but the same IPv4 address.
