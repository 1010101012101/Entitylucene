Applescripts not working in Finder since Mavericks <body> I have a bunch of Applescripts that do things like change sort column in Finder windows, but they've stopped working since Mavericks.  If I close and reopen the window, then the change takes effect, but this is annoying.  Is this a bug? Is there a workaround?  E.g.,  precodetell application "Finder" tell list view options of window 1     set sort column to name column     tell column kind column         if sort direction is normal then             set sort direction to reversed         else             set sort direction to normal         end if     end tell     set sort column to kind column end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer140969> This looks like a bug. I've tried rewriting the script various ways but the change only seems to take effect for new windows.  So here is a horribly hacky way to get this to work.  precodetell application "Finder"     tell list view options of window 1         tell column kind column             if sort direction is normal then                 set sort direction to reversed             else                 set sort direction to normal             end if         end tell         set sort column to kind column     end tell     set currentPosition to position of window 1     set currentTarget to target of window 1     make new Finder window to currentTarget     set position of window 1 to currentPosition     close window 2 end tell /code/pre
