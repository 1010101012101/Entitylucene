USB-C Wall Charger with data ports <body> I have a new MacbookPro with only USB-C ports. Does there exist a wall charger for USB-C that can provide the appropriate power while also providing a sort of built in dongle for USB and an SD card reader?  I am looking for something like the below image, where the extra USB ports also provide data to my mac when plugged in via USB-C. Does such a product exist? I would never need to remember to bring another dongle again, just bring my wall charger.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JKlFB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer280953> Nothing in a very convenient form factor like that or that include an SD Card Reader. There are some good USB-C Docks that provide connectivity and charging Kensington SD4600P USB-C Docking Station or CalDigit USB-C Docking Station but they may not be quite what you're looking for.  <comment353736> Thanks! Its unfortunate that it doesn't seem to exist yet. It'd be great to not have to bring two cords with me everywhere I go. I'd forget my head if it wasn't attached to me..
