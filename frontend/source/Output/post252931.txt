Deleting .AppleSetupDone in /var/db/ will delete my iCloud account? <body> I need to know that if I deleted the .AppleSetupDone file from my MacBook, is it going to delete my iCloud account too or is it only going to delete administration account?  <answer252933> The .AppleSetupDone file will not delete either the admin account or the iCloud account. See this article: "How to Re-Run the OS X Setup Assistant" This will just allow another admin account to be setup.   <comment314731> i know but the new admin account won't have any iCloud account on it right ? <comment314814> The new admin account can optionally be linked to iCloud. None of your iCloud documents will be touched.
