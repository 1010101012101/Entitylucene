How do I block a specific JS file on Safari? <body> I have tried adding the full URL to the JS file on Adblock Filter, but it still loads. Is there anyway that I can block specific JS files? (Or any files, really). I know how to block hosts, but not specific urls/files.  <answer160259> Did you already try JavaScript-Blocker?  They claim to block frames, XHRs, embeds, objects, and videos from loading and even images. Probably similar to NoScript in the Mozilla-universe.  <comment188411> I just tried adding the full URL of a JS file to Adblock and it blocked the file successfully. Which version of AdBlock are you using? Can you tell us which JS file you are trying to block? <comment188424> I have had JavaScript-Blocker and there is something seriously wrong with it, it makes my safari crash a lot.
