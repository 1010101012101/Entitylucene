Mail: Separate unread counts (badges) on dock icon for different accounts <body> I have multiple accounts configured in Mail and I would like to see the separate unread counts in the dock icon.  I was looking at dockstar. When I google I see that another plugin Mailbadger is also available (the homepage is down for quite sometime now, and the download available via macupdate and others seem to be outdated)  Is there another/better app/plugin for customizing Mail's dock icons?  <answer2428> For all the software I searched and see the detailed specs, Dockstar is strongthe best choice/strong for the feature you are requesting.  <comment2082> dockstar is exactly what you want, why searching for more? <comment2092> @balexandre Just to know whether there are other alternatives, which *might* be better. <comment2097> I believe Dockstar is possibly the best option. <comment2480> I have my personal mail and my office mail configured in Mail.app. I would want to see the separate unread counts. _Thought_ this might be helpful. Now that you say _I still don't get why..._ it has got into my head whether it would really be helpful... will try and let you know :-) <comment2482> I have the same (2 personal accounts, 1 company account, plus 2 more for my own companies), but I still dont get it ... every time it has a number, I check it. period. :) <comment132954> Sadly, Dockstar is not compatible with 10.9, and eCamm are no longer developing it. However, they are hoping to pass development to another developer: http://www.ecamm.com/mac/dockstar/faq.html
