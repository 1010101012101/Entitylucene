Safari pinch to zoom back out - have to initiate twice <body> strongMachine: Macbook Pro 13 inch 2017 with touch bar:/strong  I've just started using Safari.  I've noticed that if I pinch to zoom in and let go of the trackpad, I have to wait before initiating a pinch to zoom back in.   ul liIf I don't wait, then it fails to register the first attempt completely./li liIf I don't take my fingers off the trackpad, I can zoom back out, as the gesture hasn't finished I assume./li /ul  Is this how Safari always behaves or is there a setting somewhere?  Note: I've checked in Chrome and this doesn't happen, so it can't be a hardware thing.  Thanks!
