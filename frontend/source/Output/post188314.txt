Disable ⌘+SHIFT+F keyboard shortcut for fullscren <body> I use Spectacle to allow me to hit kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌥/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdF/kbd to maximize a window.  However, sometimes I miss the kbd⌥/kbd key, and this results in the system shortcut for moving the window to a new space to happen instead.  Trying to set kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdF/kbd as the key combination in Spectacle produces a "this is a system shortcut, please disable it in system preferences" message, but I can't find that shortcut anywhere under keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences.  How can I disable kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdF/kbd?  This is OSX Yosemite.  <answer188380> BetterTouchTool. Create a custom shortcut with CMD+SHIFT+F under Golbal, and leave the Assigned Action to blank. BTT will override the built-in action.  <comment222805> That shortcut is under the Finder's Go menu, and it's used to open a new Finder window to display All My Files. <comment222832> That shortcut is used in multiple places. It would be wiser to change it in Spectacle app.
