Many apps missing after restoring iPad backup to migrate to iPad 2 <body> Needing to migrate an original iPad user to an iPad 2, I used the backup and restore mechanism in iTunes (on a PC)  However, the following steps resulted in many of the apps being missing on the destination device:  ol liBacked up an original iPad to iTunes on a PC/li liFactory-reset an iPad 2/li liConnected the iPad 2 to the same PC, and restored from backup/li /ol  Some time later, the iPad 2 claimed to be set up, but many of the apps were missing. Instead of there being 3 screen-fulls of apps on the restored device, there was only one, and this was mostly the original Apple apps.  iTunes didn't report any errors throughout this process.  What can I do to fix this?  <answer44054> The original iPad was on iOS 5.0, and the destination was iOS 5.1.  I ended up having to strongupgrade the original iPad to iOS 5.1/strong, and then repeating the whole backup &amp; restore operation.   After this, all the expected apps were present on the destination device.
