Why don't my aliases in .bashrc work? <body> I have Lion on my Mac Air. I wrote some aliases in ~/.bashrc file, which looks like:  precode# Aliases alias p='pdflatex *.tex;open *.pdf' alias bromine='ssh administrator@bromine.org' /code/pre  I then sourced my .bashrc file from .bash_profile, which I believe is sourced upon startup. My .bash_profile file looks like  precode# Setting PATH for EPD-7.2-2 # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin:${PATH}" export PATH  MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 export MKL_NUM_THREADS  # MacPorts Installer addition on 2012-02-27_at_18:19:09: adding an appropriate PATH variable for use with MacPorts. export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH # Finished adapting your PATH environment variable for use with MacPorts.  # source bashrc . .bashrc /code/pre  Why is it that my aliases work sometimes upon startup, but not always - (sometimes, I have to manually source .bash_profile)?  <answer105290> It seems like your bash shell is looking for code.profile/code instead of code.bashrc/code . What you can do is make a symbolic link:  codeln -s ~/.bashrc ~/.profile/code  and restart your session (close, reopen Terminal). Any future bash setting updates can be made to code.profile/code or code.bashrc/code.  <comment54002> Can you identify a reproducible way to get a bash that doesn't have the aliases? When this happens, what does `ps -p $$ -p $PPID` show? <comment55385> Have you tried sourcing with the full path, i.e. `${HOME}/.bashrc` instead of `.bashrc`? <comment63862> I had similar issues a long time ago. I simply mashed everything into `.profile`, removed `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`, and stopped having issues. <comment64014> Thanks, I'll give that a shot and see if loading the aliases becomes more reliable. <comment126667> That might be a fix but why has this happened that seems a nasty bug. What else is broken <comment126668> How do you startup? <comment126674> The last line of your .bash_profile should be `source .bashrc` The way you are running it opens a session and then closes the session, any variables in that session will go away if you don't use the source command.
