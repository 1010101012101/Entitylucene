Jailbroken iPhone 5S stuck on boot logo <body> So I got my iPhone stolen the other day; luckily I got it back but whoever had it took the SIM card out of it and did something to it.  I have iOS 8.3 and used TaiG 2 to jailbreak it.   It's charging on my computer, but it is stuck on the Apple boot logo. I've pressed the power button and home button at the same time: it will turn off, then turn back on, do the updating bar, but only get to like 10%, then turn back off and go back to the boot logo.   I cant find anything on the internet so I came here.  Any idea on what to do?  New update: the screen turned blue, then turned off and said that the battery is dead (it's been on a charger for about 3 hours).  <answer213261> You have 2 options. 1. Restore your phone. 2. Or use this tick!  <comment259192> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer.
