Google maps consuming high mobile data <body> I'm developing an iOS application which requires to use Google Maps in that.  I implemented Google maps SDK well and working fine with drawing poly line as well.  But the problem I face is that having data consumption is too high. I checked that after 5 clicks/zoom in-out on a single map the data consumption on mobile become 100MB.  Is there any way to reduce consumption for Google Maps.  Thanks.
