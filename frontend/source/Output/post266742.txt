Can't access iPhoto Library <body> When I click on iPhoto Library in ~Pictures, I get the following error:     Cannot Open Merged Library   I never merged iPhoto with the newer Photos app, but I can only assume this is what happened - is this correct?  Reviewing the sizes of iPhoto and Photo in Finder indicate iPhoto is 10 gb and Photos 6 gb.   I can access my iPhoto Library files via the open package contents - Master folder, but everything was organized in albums, and I can only access images by date - and they are all difficult to access via many sub folders.  How do I determine if all my iPhoto images and albums are in Photo? And if not, where can I access the albums?  <comment334525> I've never really been a fan of iPhoto or the new Photos app. I don't really know how to answer your question but for future reference, there is also another built in application called Image Capture that allows you to auto import photos when a device like your phone is plugged in. Images will be saved directly to your Pictures album which you can access from Finder. Hope you get it all sorted out. Best of luck.
