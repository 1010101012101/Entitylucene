How to copy one cell's value to other cells of the same date in Numbers? <body> Given one spreadsheet in Numbers as the following. Column A is datetime, and column B is the value. For each date (ex, 2015-12-01), there is just one cell with non-empty value on 05AM. Ex, there are 24 cells for code2015-12-01/code and only cell code2015-12-01 05AM/code has non-empty value.  My question is, how can we copy (or spread) the value in code2015-12-01 05AM/code to all other (23) cells belonging to the same date automatically (through formula)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2cYeh.png" alt="enter image description here"  PS. The background story is that this sheet is programming generated from Netflix Ice about S3 usage. As AWS S3 IA's usage calculation is by day (05AM) while S3 standard's usage calculation is by hour. I have to combine them...  <comment270919> Will the value *always* be at 05AM? <comment271105> Yes. For this scenario. It is.
