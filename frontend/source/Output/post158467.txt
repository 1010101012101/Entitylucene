how to delete an administrator on yosemite <body> My roommate moved out. He and i are both administrators on my iMac. How can I delete him?  I have tried going into system preferences, users &amp; groups, but even after I unlock it I cannot make any changes to his account.   <answer158503> I got this hint from here http://applehelpwriter.com/2013/05/09/how-to-log-out-another-user-without-logging-in/  Log out the user or any other processes that is still running owned by the user you wish to delete.     ol   liOpen up Activity Monitor (/Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app)/li   liUse the drop down menu in the Task bar to change the menu to ‘Other User Processes’  (note: you can use ‘All Processes’ in the menu if you   wish, but that is less safe as it makes it possible to accidentally   click on your own user process in step 4 below!)./li   liIn the filter bar, type loginwindow./li   liFrom the list of users that show up, for each one that you wish to log out:      ul   liclick on its row in the Activity Monitor pane to highlight the process/li   lipress the ‘Quit Process’ icon in the Task bar above/li   lifrom the resulting dialogue window, click ‘Force Quit’/li   lisupply an Admin password if requested./li   /ul/li   /ol   <comment186300> Is he still logged in? <comment186309> Also a screenshot of "Users & Groups" after unlocking would help <comment186311> If you know his password log in the log out.
