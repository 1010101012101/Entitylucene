Why is my icloud backup taking so long? <body> I just created an icloud account and i am backing it up and it says it will take 3 hours.  I have no pictures on my phone so i think its just backing up contacts, reminders, etc.  Does anyone know why it would take this long?  Is there something that i could be configured incorrectly?  Any advice would be great.  <answer71259> iCloud backups the following:  ul liPhotos and videos in the Camera Roll/li liDevice settings (for example: Phone Favorites, Wallpaper, and Mail, Contacts, Calendar accounts)/li liApp data/li liHome screen and app organization/li liMessages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS)/li liRingtones/li liVisual Voicemails/li /ul  It might be due to your app data size and also if this is the first time backing up then it will take a bit longer. Have a look at this link, it will explain why else it might  take longer.
