Saving and restoring the brightness setting of a display <body> I have a dual monitor display and I calibrate both displays. My calibrator generates a calibration profile for each monitor, however the brightness is not saved to the profile (apparently this is the same with all calibrators). This means that although I can now switch between profiles with ease, if I change the brightness of a monitor (deliberately or accidentally), I have no way of getting back to the brightness that is correct for the profile.  Is there any way I can save and restore the brightness of each monitor?  Note: When I say embrightness/em I am talking about the Brightness slider found in System Prefs  Displays. The slider offers no clue as to the numeric value of the brightness, so there is no way to return to it.  <answer261834> One approach is to use the open source command line tool, brightness, to set the value on-demand. This way you could find your preferred brightness value and apply that value as needed, or per-profile.  Mac OS X Hints' discussion on Adjust brightness from Terminal covers the tool, how to compile it, and possible scripts to extend its use.  OS X Daily has also covered the tool in Adjust screen brightness from command line.  <answer261950> This just adds a basic how-to to Graham Miln's answer.  ol liDownload source from here./li liOpen Commandline/li liRun codegcc -std=c99 -o brightness brightness.c -framework IOKit -framework ApplicationServices/code This will create a binary in the same location/li /ol  To print display(s) brightness:  ol liRun code/path/to/binary/brightness -l/code/li /ol  This will print for example:   display 0: main display, ID 0x42b19a8 display 0: brightness 0.282261 display 1: ID 0x4248e66 display 1: brightness 0.781247  To set display brightness  ol liRun code/path/to/binary/brightness -d {display index} {display value}/code/li /ol  Replace {display index} with the numerical index of the display as shown when printing the brightness value. Replace {display value} with a number between 0 and 1.   <comment328082> I've added a separate answer with detailed steps. Feel free to copy-paste over to your answer and delete my answer. <comment328098> Does the `brightness` tool do what you need? If so, good to hear you found a workable solution. <comment328210> Yep. It does. Thank you. <comment342108> New home for brightness on [GitHub](https://github.com/nriley/brightness). <comment342110> @FranklinYu thank you. I have updated the link in the answer.
