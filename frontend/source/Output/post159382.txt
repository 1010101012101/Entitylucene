Hook up 3 monitors to Mac Mini Late 2014 <body> I have the Mac Mini late 2014 and want to hook up 3 monitors in total. It works great with 2 displays (1x Thunderbolt + 1x HDMI). Once I add a third monitor to the second Thunderbolt port, just nothing happens. What can I do to get my third monitor working?  <answer159389> This article might contain information on why this doesn't work.  First off, you're talking about a low-end machine which utilizes shared system memory for its graphics.  I drive two Thunderbolt displays with my 2012 Mac Mini with 16GB of RAM and an SSD.  The Mini uses a static amount of RAM for video, it does not adjust based on how much RAM is in the machine.  As an aside, this is a good reason to max out the RAM on a machine with shared video.  You have a machine with shared video RAM totaling 1 GB, and you're trying to drive two 1440p displays and one 1080p display, a total of 5.76 MP of video output.  It's worth noting, the iMac 5K is driving emless/em pixels, and it requires a 2 GB dedicated video card.  <answer175947> You can do 1x hdmi 1x hdmi to mini display And 1x hdmi to hdmi-usb dongle  The Mac mini only supports two monitors unless you mess with the graphics, so using the usb dongle tricks it. Warning (eats ram)  <answer178616> This works for me: https://www.i-tech.com.au/products/146188_Wavlink_WL_UG35D6_USB_3_0_to_DVI.aspx  Note: in my experience, the more additional USB devices you have plugged in, the more likely your 3rd monitor is likely to not work (flicks on and off) due to, I assume, lack of power.  <answer206305> Apple's specs show that the late-2014 (which is still being sold today, October 2015) Mac Mini can support up to strongtwo displays/strong using its HDMI and thunderbolt ports.br I've confirmed this by trying to plug in 3 monitors directly into the ports on the Mac Mini (two via thunderbolt, 1 via HDMI), with the same results as the OP...one of the monitors is not driven.  h2The following 3-monitor setup worked for me:/h2  ul liLate 2014 Mac Mini with 8GB RAM (purchased Oct 2015)/li li3 monitors, each with 1920x1200 resolution/li liMonitor 1: driven by Mac mini HDMI port (HDMI-to-HDMI cable)/li liMonitor 2: driven by Mac Mini thunderbolt port (I used this thunderbolt-to-DVI cable)/li liMonitor 3: driven via USB 3.0 adapter (I used this one from CableMatters and have had zero issues with flicker/performance, although I am not trying to play games or watch video on it...I use it for work)./li /ul  hr  Some notes:  ul liYou can use a different USB adapter (there are several on the market) but make sure that it's Mac compatible.
