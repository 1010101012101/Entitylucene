Preview on Lion will open all images I opened last time, and need to close each window one by one? <body> Say if I clicked open 10 image files, and 2 PDF files, and quit Preview, then next time when I click on 1 image file or just start Preview, all those 12 other windows will open too...  I was playing a clicking game to close them one by one... is there a quick way to make Preview not do that or "Close All"?   (while keeping other apps to open the previous state).  <answer49325> Something like RestoreMeNot or Tinker Tool can be used to selectively control which apps restore their windows and should be able to do what you want.  Alternatively, using KBD⌥/KBD + KBD⌘/KBD + KBDW/KBD in Preview (and most other apps) will close all currently open windows.  <answer117384> As an alternative to RestoreMeNot, you can run a command like this in Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false /code/pre  If others search for how to disable restoring state for all applications, enable this option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gh7mW.png" alt=""  I have disabled restoring state from System Preferences but enabled it just for Safari:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool true /code/pre  <comment56460> it does work... just wonder why OPT-CMD-w is not listed on the File menu <comment56463> @動靜能量 It is, but its kind of hidden. You'll see it if you open the File menu and press the ⌥ key. The "Close Window" item changes to "Close All". This sort of thing is also the case for a lot of apps. <comment56552> so the OPT key is a way to show more choices... the original list is shorten so that it is not exceedingly long... good to know, but sorry can't give you more up votes as i am limited to one vote <comment56553> but the way I tried CTRL and CMD or Fn, and they don't do that... just the OPT key does
