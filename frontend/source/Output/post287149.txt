How to completely remove everything related to Python on my macOS Sierra? <body> I am someone who uses python purely for my calculations and does not know of the mechanisms behind installing Python. Over the course of several months, by following some instructions given by my school and online forums I have installed some modules such as numpy, scipy and matplotlib. During this period I had Python 2.7.10 and Python 3.6.0 on my mac.  Then I had the need to learn openCV, and somehow by following the instructions i ended up with Python 3.6.1 on my mac. I had to reinstall numpy, scipy and matplotlib as it was not available on the Python 3.6.1, and I had set all my .py files to open with the Python 3.6.1 by default.  And finally, recently I had the need to plot 3D plots, thus I followed online instructions to install mayAVI. After doing so I had problems import numpy, scipy and matplotlib in my Python 3.6.1.  All these changes have been very frustrating, and I would like to completely uninstall and delete everything related to Python (be it 2 or 3) on my Mac so that I can install them again properly from scratch. Could anyone tell me a foolproof method of how I could do so?  <comment362444> you don't want to do that. Macs come with a version of python already installed.  Removing that could maybe hose your Mac. I think the system software makes use of their version of python.
