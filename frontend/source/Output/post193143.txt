Can I use an iPhone 4 to stream music from my computer, and control that music with my Android device? <body> I have a jailbroken iPhone 4 that I'd like to use to play music on my receiver. It would be hooked up 24/7, only serving one purpose. The music would be stored on an HTPC. Ideally I could stream FLAC, and would like to be able to change songs with my android device. Is there anything that would allow me to do that?  <comment230057> Is your question just "what app can I use on Android to control my jailbroken iPhone"? Or is it "what app can I use on my iPhone to play music through my receiver" and then the other question? It's not clear from your question whether you are already able to play music through your receiver. (It's also not clear why you wouldn't just use the Android device to stream music from your computer to it to the receiver.) <comment230058> @tubedogg Edited for clarity
