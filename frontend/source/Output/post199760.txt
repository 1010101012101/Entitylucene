Why are all my photos in one Collection? <body> I recently imported a large collection of old family photos that my dad had scanned some years ago. Since they didn't have any date/time metadata of their own they all show the date I copied them onto my computer and into Photos, so I have been going through and fixing the dates.   My library now contains over 10k photos from 1937 - 2015, so the Years view is pretty crucial to navigating through them all. This also means using Collections and Moments, which hasn't been a problem until recently: There is one Collection that contains about 90% of the library. It has a 58-year date range, locations spanning two states, and photos from a wide variety of sources - the first is a scanned copy of a birth certificate from 1937, and the last is a picture I saved from an app on my iPhone yesterday.  How are the contents of Collections determined? Is it some information I can change about the photos? I have no idea what that information could be, since I don't see anything that they all have in common.
