Reload modified system plist <body> I tried modifying a preference pane plist (with defaults write), but the change doesnâ€™t take effect. Is there a way to make that happen?  <answer205616> Assuming a newer version of OS X (10.9+ ?).  You have to kill two processes: the process that manages the preference you are modifying (e.g. killall Finder if it is com.apple.finder that you are modifying) and "cfprefsd".  "cfprefsd" is a newer preference caching service of OS X.  In Terminal.app: codekillall cfprefsd &amp;&amp; killall Finder/code.  You could also restart your computer.  <comment247925> You may need to kill the defaults server. <comment247927> @fd0: How is that done?
