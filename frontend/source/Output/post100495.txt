Which would be better for FCP and Pro Tools? Mac Mini 2.3GHz i7Quad or iMac 2.9GHz i5 Quad? <body> I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question.  I've been a post production recording engineer and sound editor for 20 years, but for the last 4 I've been on disability because of arthritis and Crohn's Disease and so I haven't been keeping up on the technology.  I'd like to start trying to at least do a bit of freelance work but my MacBook Pro 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo just doesn't have the muscle any more.  Keeping in mind that cost is absolutely a consideration, I'm looking at a strongMac Mini 2.3GHz i7 Quad Core 4GB RAM (emor/em 2.5GHz i5 Dual Core 8GB RAM)/strong and a 24" Dell IPS HD monitor emor/em an strongiMac 2.7GHz i5 Quad Core 8GB RAM 21.5"/strong.  I know both monitors would be the same resolution and the iMac monitor would probably look better, but I don't know which computer is better suited to my current needs.  At least for now I'd be running emPro Tools 8/em and emFCP Studio/em.  I know I'll have to learn FCPX at some point...but one thing at a time.  I don't need to have both programs open at the same time, so multi-tasking isn't a big consideration.  For the most part, data would be on external USB 3 drives.  But a couple of other questions.  Would I need to add RAM to the Mini?  Will the Mini support an IPS monitor and ALSO an HDMI monitor as a preview screen?  How much difference is Dual Core vs. Quad Core? I could get the 2.5GHz Dual Core Mini for only $600, and then add the extra RAM.  I'm one of those rabid Apple lovers so I'd obviously prefer the iMac, but I can't spend an extra couple of hundred dollars just because it'll look better on my desk.  However strongLONGEVITY/strong is as big a concern as cost.  I'm likely going to need this computer to do the job for quite a while!  So I know that for now the software I'm using doesn't really make use of multiple cores, but newer software will right?  Other than security, is there a big difference between the i5 and i7?  Also, I don't need to start tomorrow, so what is the rumour mill saying about new release dates?  Will new iMacs have emRetina/em displays?  I've checked a bunch of rumour sites but nobody has any strongRELIABLE/strong information.  I'm sorry, I know it's a very loooong question and it seems like I've done no research on my own.  I have done some, but the answers vary greatly.  So any advice would be strongGREATLY/strong appreciated.  If I can spend $900 dollars instead of $1300 I can eat next month (that's a joke - it's not THAT bad).  But I don't want to regret the purchase a year from now!  <answer100504> According to everymac.com the mac mini configuration is more capable  (geekbench results for 32 and 64-bit OS'es respectively)  Mac Mini 2.3GHz i7  10626/11825*  iMac "Core i5" 2.9 21.5-Inch 9202/10756*  personally i would add 4GB or 8GB more to the mac mini at some later time. (not at the time of buying though as apple tends to charge more than say, OWC)  I think both computers would serve you well for what you want but i would prefer the Mac mini as the iMac is a bit less capable power wise and additionally more difficult to upgrade..  <answer100562> Actually, strongthe most important/strong hardware component in video rendering strongis videocard/strong (GPU).  iMac has discrete NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M adapter with dedicated memory, while Mac Mini has integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 card. The difference is jaw-dropping. Some benchmarks to prove this:  ul li3DMark 11: strong2320/strong points in 650M, only em604/em points in HD 4000./li li3DMark 11 (GPU): strong2112/strong points in 650M, only em524/em points in HD 4000./li li3DMark 06: strong13453/strong points in 650M, only em4410/em points in HD 4000./li /ul  I believe, you got the point. HD 4000 is a bit less powerful than NVIDIA strong610M/strong. Quad-core processor will not matter when integrated graphics will render emevery frame for 2 seconds/em.     Geekbench strongis more about CPU/strong, than GPU. Video editing strongis more about   GPU/strong, than CPU.   8 Gb of RAM is enough for working with 4K@24fps projects.  This fall new Macs will be released with better hardware and the new OS X Mavericks will roll out with performance (CPU and memory) improvements (more free RAM for FCPX).  So I advice you to wait for a while with buying new Mac. Get better.  <comment118283> That's great thanks.  But there are only 2 RAM slots right?  So if I add RAM later, don't I basically throw away the 4GB it came with?  So while Apple is more expensive, wouldn't the cost be offset by NOT having to pay for the 2 2GB chips?  Or are 3rd party that much cheaper?  According to the Apple Store, upgrading to 8GB is only $100.  What do you think? <comment118285> I think you're right about RAM.  I can get a refurbished Mini with 4GB installed, pull it out and buy 16GB for $140 CDN or 8GB for $80.  One question.  How reliable is third party RAM?  Is one supplier better than another? <comment118303> i would go with OWC myself (and have done...i upgraded my late 2011 MBPro  with 16 GB with absolutely no problem <comment118336> That is correct (GPU is more important than CPU for video rendering)  the application i was thinking about more was Pro Tools
