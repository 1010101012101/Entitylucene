OS X El Capitan installation error: AMD-Action:authenticate:SP <body> When doing a clean re-installation of El Capitan (highest supported version) from a bootable USB on an older Mac (MBP, 15-inch, Late 2008), I get this error:     An unexpected error occured while signing in.

El Capitain was already installed though, so I didn't need to go into recovery mode. Correcting the time was enough.
