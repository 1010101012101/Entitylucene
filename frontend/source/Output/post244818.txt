Change decimal separator in Excel in an old spreadsheet <body> I created an Excel spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel Version 15.23.2 while the option for the decimal separator was set to code,/code (comma). This setting had been made in the Language &amp; Region settings of Mac OS X El Capitan. However, I then copied data into it from a csv file that was using code./code (dot) as the decimal separator. Now, these cells with the dots are not read as numerical, i.e. I cannot sum them up, etc.  I already switched the Language &amp; Region setting under System Preferences to using code./code (dot) as a decimal separator. (System Preferences - Language &amp; Region - Advanced - Number separators: Grouping: code,/code, Decimal: code./code)  Then I restarted the computer, opened my file again, and still the floating point numbers in the same spreadsheet are not recognized as numbers by Excel. When I open a strongnew/strong Excel spreadsheet, and enter some floating point numbers using the dot separator, these are recognized as floating point numbers.  Did I miss something? Or could I somehow convert my file into a version using the code./code decimal separator?  Thanks for any suggestions!  Edit: When I copy an entire column with (non-recognized) floating point numbers and paste it into the same place, these cells are then recognized as being numerical. However, when I do this with the entire spreadsheet, it does not work.  <comment301793> This doesn't seem like an OS X-specific problem to me. Try asking on SuperUser, another SE site: http://superuser.com <comment301891> Sorry, but I have to disagree that it is not OS X, or at least in general OS-specific. If you google, you will find that in Windows, the decimal-separator-option is set within the Excel Software, whereas on OS X, it is set in the system-wide options. Hence, I assume this is OS X-specific. <comment301933> Ok, fair enough.
