Network OK but no Internet connection. Can this be faulty hardware? <body> Since a few days ago, my 2011 Macbook Air running Mavericks 10.9.2 stopped connecting to our TimeCapsule wifi. Other Apple and non-Apple devices connect fine so I've ruled out a router problem already.  Within this specific computer I get the exclamation mark over the wifi icon on the menu bar, with the alert "No Internet Connection", thus I cannot get an IP address. Network services other than IP work. e.g I can connect to the Time Capsule's hard drive, and also browse and manage this Macbook's files to and form other macs on my home network.  I've booted from an external drive and have the same diagnosis, so this might be hardware.  What can I do to further test this, and hopefully solve the connection issue?  em[edit: 1 day later]/em  strongMy network topology is:/strong  ul liCISCO cable modem/router, sharing over ethernet and wifi (my macs have never ever been able to connect to this wifi network.
