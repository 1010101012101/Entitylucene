Midnight Commander installed via Ports to support scp <body> I have installed Midnight Commander via Ports, but I am unable to connect to a remote computer to copy files as:  precode  cd #sh:user@server.net /code/pre  I keep getting:   precode  "Cannot CHDIR to #sh:user@server.net". /code/pre  How can I get my MC to be able to do that?  <comment83507> Not sure if it would solve your problem but I think that brew became a better alternative than macports.
