unexpected workspace transposition <body> I am using yosemite and take advantage of workspaces.  Occasionally, my workspace locations get transposed.  E.g. workspace 2-3 and workspace 3-2.  I use ctr-N where N is the workspace that I want to go to.  What is the hot key or command that causes this to happen?  It happens to me every once in a while and I can never seem to figure out what I have done to cause this to happen.  <answer217711> Possibly System Prefs  Mission Control  Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1X10B.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment263197> I had it checked, so presumably unchecking it will solve my problem.  Thanks! <comment263198> Welcome - I'm pretty sure that will be it
