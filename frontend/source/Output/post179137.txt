Strange noise when holding MacBook Pro <body> I recently bought a MacBook Pro Retina and for now I'm a little bit worried. Everytime I hold it up by one of its edges or even press this part (video), it makes this strange noise, like its gonna break. I thought the material was resistant. br I'm pressing the downside of the notebook, like at the start of the notebook. Downside, of course. If I hold the notebook to get it by this particular corner it also makes this strange noise. I'm a little worried. br Should I take it to an Apple Store? br  Here is a video with the strange sound!

If so then that is fairly normal as there are gaps between the top and bottom of the casing to allow for airflow and also this is where the speaker sound comes from <comment212287> Did you already check if it is the cooling fan (check ifixit.com for an "exploded view" of your RetMBP)? <comment212295> Echoing @mitchellD. I have a late 2013 rMBP (same form factor). **This is normal.**  Not airflow (heat dissipates through the back), but indeed thereâ€™s a gap between the screen and the keyboard/surrounding area. If you look at the outer bezel, you will notice the aluminum lining is raised 1 mm - meant to prevent the screen from chafing. <comment212396> @MitchellD Hi everyone. Thanks for the answers. I was too tired and ended up saying some things wrong. The part when it makes this noise is on the bopposite/b side of the part where the screen touches the "case". So, it's like on the start. Thanks!! <comment212398> I added some pictures to the post
