Cant remove stalled (inProgress) Time Machine backup <body> I have recently switched to a newer MBP from a TM backup. Unfortunately something seems to have gone wrong during the migration. TM cannot complete a backup, it just keep accumulating into a directory, with code.inProgress/code suffix.   After a bit googling I found this answer, which suggests removing the folder by moving it to the Trash. That doesn't really work as it just says Removing files, but there is literally no progress after hours. I tried to remove the folder from the terminal, that's a no go due to Permission Denied.  I tried to change to a admin account, then do a codesudo rm -rf/code and that results in Operation Not Permitted. Do I need to disable codecsrutils/code just to be able to repair a stalled backup?  Suggestions?  <answer286828> codetmutil listbackups/code shows you a list of the backups found on your Time Machine disk.br To delete a backup shown in this list, run  precodetmutil delete /path/to/backup.inProgress /code/pre  <comment361100> Does `tmutil listbackups` show that backup's timestamp? Are you able to `tmutil delete /path/to/backup.inProgress`? <comment361156> Use the hidden command `tmutil status` and post back what you get, assuming the backup is currently running. <comment361994> @grgarside that works thank you.. If you put it down as an answer I'll accept it
