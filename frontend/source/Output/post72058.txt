How can I request a status update on an apple bug report? <body> So I was reading the FAQ for Apple's bug reporter site and I came across this:   precodeTo request a status on an existing issue, please update your report directly via the Apple Bug Reporter requesting a status update and we will provide you with any available information. /code/pre  I got curious about this, and I went back to bugreport.apple.com to look at one of my pending bug reports and I didn't see any way of explicitly asking for a codestatus update/code. I feel that I'm missing something obvious, because I expect the FAQ to be correct, but so far I haven't got the faintest. Any help?  <answer72406> It's as simple as posting new details on your bug with a sentence requesting a status update. There is no dedicated button to do this. From personal experience I doubt you'll get any helpful information though. Many things in Radar live there for yearsâ€¦  <comment84255> Hmm, OK, thanks for the info.
