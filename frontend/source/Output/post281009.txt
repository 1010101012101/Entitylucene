My username not displaying in Favorites on the left <body> I have a setting that whenever I open up Finder, it would open my username files.  However, it does not show within Favorites. Why does it not show there? How can I add my username there?  <answer281013> Finder → Preferences (⌘,) → Sidebar and enable the option for your home folder.                                    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2TY6y.png" width="355"  It's enabled by default, so perhaps you removed it accidentally, either by dragging it off the window or right-clicking and choosing Remove from Sidebar?
