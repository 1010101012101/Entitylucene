Is it possible to activate an iPhone 4 without a SIM? <body> So we bought an iPhone 4 from the Apple store. But we didn't get a micro-SIM as there are no PAYG tariffs on micro-SIM available.  Is there anyway to activate the device without getting hold of a SIM? I don't want to sign up to a contract just to develop with.  <answer1908> Maybe you know somenone who owns an iPhone 4 already. Ask her/him for the micro SIM, put it into your device, activate your iPhone and give the micro SIM back to the other person.  <answer1909> If all you need is a PAYG SIM, you should note that micro-SIMs are physically the same as standard SIMs except for the shape of the plastic surrounding the chip. I think that with a bit of careful cutting you can trim away the excess plastic and use any PAYG SIM.  If you Google "trim micro sim" you'll find a few blog posts describing the process.  <answer3342> I used this excellent description (PDF) to cut my normal SIM into microSIM format. It was very easy to follow and it works perfectly!  <comment1634> This is what Apple told me to do. Just don't know anyone with one!!! Thanks anyway <comment1635> Thanks yea I've too just read that! Thing is, I don't want to destroy my current SIM, just want to activate this phone. I've just ordered a cheap micro SIM so I will try that. Just didn't want to wait! Thanks <comment1636> In the UK you can typically buy a PAYG SIM from a supermarket or mobile phone shop for Â£10 or less. So you wouldn't have to wait long. I don't know how it works elsewhere. <comment1637> o2 told me that they didn't sell them, but I've found one online! I will just have to wait! My iPhone 4 is doing a good job at being a paper weight for now! <comment10022> I did end up buying a Microsim cutter but this also works.
