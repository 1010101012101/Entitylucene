Auto configure MacOS for Singleapp usage <body> i made a little game-ish presentation for a client to be run on a Mac in an exhibition.  Now they asked me if I can make some kind of installer, which will do all the user-configuration like:  auto start / shutdown,  configure a useraccount without admin rights to run the application, deactivation of updates,  auto run the application on start,  keep-alive of the application etc: normally i'd do all of this manually but this time it is in another city and i will not have remote access to the computer at all. the client is very tech un-savvy so it needs to be automated. Is there some solution for this already? I only saw "Packages.app", but I am not sure if this is what I'd need.  Thanks a bundle kind folks!
