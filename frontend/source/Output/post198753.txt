Magic Mouse low battery when not in touch with Mac <body> Anybody else notice that their Magic Mouse goes dead a lot quicker ... like... within 15 days or so if you use a MacBook and are always leaving your mouse behind?  I use great batteries, won't mention the brand but they are good.  Never the less... if my MacBook stayed in the same location as the mouse it would be fine and could manage it's power better but if it's alone, it has no way to manage it's power apparently?  You would think it would trickle down rapidly when it's not detecting it's paired device and just go into a low power state somehow... I dunno...?  Just for such a high tech device you would think it would be a little more power efficient when in roam.  Anyway, figured I'd post this since I hadn't seen anyone else post about it yet.  <comment237953> Have you ever considered powering down the Magic Mouse when it is not in use? <comment237954> Of course I have... I even put it in my post. :) Yes, one might think to power down their device... but do I power it down everytime I leave the office... heck no, that's absurd.  It should be able to manage its power a bit better than to drain it constantly while it can't find the Mac.  I guess my standard for the tech is just too high.  I feel like it should have a tiny bit of code to think through the situation to not ruin your batteries because you forget to turn it off...
