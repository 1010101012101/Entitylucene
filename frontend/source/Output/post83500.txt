iPhone 4S with latest update now charges very slowly <body> My iPhone 4S (iOS 6.1.x) dropped it's charge today.  It now is charging very slowly.  I deleted my iCloud account to see if that would improve battery life.  It still is charging slowly, and has taken about 3 hours to charge 37%.  Is there something I can do to "fix" this battery life problem?  <answer83506> Charge is like a bathtub.  If it is draining faster than filling the total level will drop.  The iPhone uses a LOT of power for a USB device, so there's a few potential sources of your issue:  ol liThe power source may not be rated high enough.  If you're using a 3rd-party usb charger, make sure it is.  There are a lot of phony Apple chargers out there (yes, it's true) make sure yours is genuine./li liThe device itself may be drawing power.  When charging, turn off the screen when it isn't in-use.  /li liMake sure your GPS isn't in use either, as that will consume gads of power./li liTurn off Bluetooth devices paired with the device when not in use./li /ol  If none of these fix your issue, post back.  <answer83507> Plug it in and then power it off.  The charging circuitry runs from the firmware and not the OS - so you will either get a full charge and have a chance to reboot it in 2 or 4 hours to check on the charge status or know where the failure lies.  It's most likely a temporary CPU hog draining charge as fast as it can accumulate and a simple reboot (hold the home button, slide to power off, restart once it shuts down normally) is generally going to clear this up.  <answer117987> Just go to strongSettings/strong → strongGeneral/strong → strongReset/strong  strongReset All Settings/strong  This is the solution to get the iPhone back to normal (quick) charging! Worked for me after annoying 2 weeks of figuring out why it charged so slow! You won't lose data/contacts. Only Wi-Fi passwords and some basic settings, but this is not a big deal compare to the slow charge problem! Success!  <comment137747> My phone finally charged to 100%. I was using the USB charger that came with the phone (Apple charger). BUT...the green battery is missing. It used to show up while it was charging.
