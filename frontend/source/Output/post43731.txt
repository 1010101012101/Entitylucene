Lion login screen <body> I have a lot of users in my household (6 total + guest).  Is there a way to wrap or stack the user icons rather than having them scroll off the right part of the screen?  <answer44657> Currently there is no way of changing the users list formatting.  The solution I use on our main computer is to simply disable the login icons and let users type their username/password.  To do so:  ul ligo to "System Preferences" /li liselect "Users &amp; Groups" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/23WXF.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liThere chose login options img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JERHL.png" alt="enter image description here"/li lifor the "Display Login Window as" option select "Name and Password" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/taep2.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  <comment49692> It's not an answer, but you know you can type the name to get to the off-screen items or just have people fill in the short name and password (if any). I hope someone has a better solution than an attempt to mitigate this layout.
