Shortcut to Eclipse in /Applications <body> I just downloaded Eclipse for OS X. I managed to run it, but I want to put it directly in code/Applications/code:  I don't want to place the codeeclipse/code folder, which has inside it the codeEclipse.app/code, inside code/Applications/code, but I want to place a shortcut to codeEclipse.app/code directly into code/Applications/code (so I can run codeeclipse/code with one click, as if it was any other app inside code/Applications/code).  Any ideas how to do so? Tried a symlink but doesn't seem to work.  <answer117450> A symlink won't work as at the command line level an application is a directory.  Make an alias to the Eclipse application in the Finder and drop that into /Applications and it will work fine.  By the way, you will see in the eclipse folder a file codeeclipse/code which is a link to the actual Eclipse unix executable that lives in codeEclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/code alongside the codeeclipse.ini/code file that defines all the startup options. You might want to replicate that link to somewhere in your PATH so that you can run Eclipse from the command line.  <answer117451> Using the codeln/code command will indeed create an alias to an app in /Applications, provided you use sudo.  You might want to try:  precodesudo ln -s &lt;full path to Eclipse.app&gt; /Applications /code/pre  <answer117458> ul liRight clic on Eclipse.app  Make alias/li liMove the alias into code/Application/code/li /ul
