kernel: firefox/safari[...] unable to quarantine: 13 <body> I have updated my OS X to the new El Capitan version and now I have an issue in the Firefox/Safari browsers with downloading of the emsmall/em files to a location on a emnetwork/em emshare/em. Most of these downloads are failing. emSmall/em means tens or hundreds of kilobytes. There are messages in the system log after each such failed download:br codekernel: firefox/safari[...] unable to quarantine: 13/codebr At the same time I can successfully download these files to the local storage and then move them to the same network location in the Finder. And there's no issue if I download large (megabytes) files.  Is this issue has a known solution?
