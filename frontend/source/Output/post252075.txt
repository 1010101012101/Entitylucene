I tried hard reset and recording a new video. No luck  strongHow to make slow motion videos play back on iOS 9.3.5 and iPhone 6s+?/strong  <answer252343> I fixed the issue by recording a new regular video (60 fps) and playing it back. The video plays, and after that slow motion videos play as well. Until this step, slow motion videos displayed a spinner and did not play.   <comment313586> I can't reproduce this. Are the videos recorded with camera.app or a third-party app? How long are the videos? Have you let it sit with the spinner for a minute or two to see if it eventually plays?
