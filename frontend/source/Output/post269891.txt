How to delete a game from iPad? <body> My ex and I had a family sharing farm on three iPads when we split one iPad left. The game is still on all three iPads.  I want to delete it off my two so I can start over. If I delete it in my Game Center will it delete it off his sons iPad as well?  I don't want him to lose his game but need it of mine to start over. When I go into my account iCloud it only shows my two iPads on it.  <comment339087> If you are sharing the same Apple ID, it might reset theirs too. Golden rule, don't share Apple IDs, that's not the way they're meant to be used.
