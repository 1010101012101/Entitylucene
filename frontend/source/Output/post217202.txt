This site, Ask Different, tends to attract experts on Mac hardware running OS X. <comment262524> well it is on macbook air, but thx <comment262548> maybe this will help  `sudo apt-get install build-essential dkms linux-headers-generic`  and `sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source` <comment262608> @maetsoh Says, couldn't locate bcmwl-kernel-source :( <comment311298> I know this is late, but you can check my answer here, http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/250639/127405
