To install Pandoc's manuals <body> I run codecabal install pandoc pandoc-citeproc/code as described in the manual. I get nothing from codeman pandoc/code.  Pandoc exists in brew but I would like to know how you get pandoc by manuals too.  I would like to read codeman pandoc_markdown/code.   How can you install pandoc with manuals?   <answer194484> There is codepandoc --help/code as well as the online documentation/user guide. I have pandoc installed via Homebrew and I also have no codeman/code pages.  precodeerik@Eriks-MBP:~$ man pandoc No manual entry for pandoc /code/pre  <answer194564> strongPandoc 1.15.0.4/strong was just released, will install the MAN pages during the cabal install process.  However, you need to make sure your MANPATH environment variable includes the cabal MAN page directory.  (On OSX, this is generally code$HOME/Library/Haskell/share/man/code.)  Add to your   code~/.bashrc: MANPATH=$HOME/Library/Haskell/share/man:$MANPATH/code
