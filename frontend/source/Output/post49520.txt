Connect to network says "Connection failed" but it actually isn't <body> On most occasions, when I try to connect to a new wi-fi network, after I enter the password and click "Connect" the connection dialog says "Connection failed" after a little pause, but emin fact/em the connection is established, the menubar widget displays the network and everything works normally.  Except the network is never saved to the list of known networks, so every time I have to enter the password again.  What may be the issue here?

I could connect although it said "connection failed."  I observed that my network was also not in the preferred networks list.  I resolved the problem in two steps.  I manually entered my network's name and my networks password to keychain list. After that, in the system preferences advanced window, I manually added my network to the list of preferred networks by clicking on add button (+) and dragged it to the first line of the list.  I hope this helps.   <answer92341> Update: I never got it fixed in Lion, no matter what I did some networks were still failing. However, upgrading to Mountain Lion did fix the issue without any effort on my side.  So my suggestion/"answer" is to upgrade to Mountain Lion.  <comment58838> @LeonidShevtsov Have you found out a solution for your wireless oddity?
