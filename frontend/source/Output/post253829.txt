How do I force iCloud Drive to upload "waiting" files? <body> I've got a bunch of random files and folders that are not being synced to iCloud. They just say "waiting" below them when you view them in Finder.  However, there is no progress bar in iCloud Drive, which should indicate the process is finished, but it isn't. The files don't show up on the web or on any other devices. It has been like this for months now. (Just haven't really bothered to solve it until now.)  One way to sort of solve this is to open the affected files one by one. However, due to the amount of affected files, this is not feasible.  I'd like a simple way to force iCloud to go through the "waiting" files and upload them. Is this possible?  <comment315975> Did you try to drag-and-drop all of them out of the iCloud Drive folder, into an offline folder on your hard drive, then dragging them back in? <comment316363> Most of the files are uploaded. There are hundreds of GBs, so I'd really not go through it again if possible, considering it might not even solve the problem. Besides, they were in my local Documents folder before. <comment355979> @tubedogg I've now tried that - on a brand new computer even. Didn't work.
