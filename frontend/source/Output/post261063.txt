Open Directory won't work with SSL <body> I had issues with an older server, so I have set up a replicated OD on 2 mac mini's.  They are both running OS X 10.11.6 and Server 5.2.  Now I have both servers up and running, I have added third party signed SSL certs.  I am able to connect using a few pieces of software.  When I open "Directory Utility" and edit LDAPV3 under Services, I can see that SSL isn't enabled.  I enabled this, and ensured OD has the new cert assigned to it, but I am then unable to connect using the Directory Editor in Directory Utility.  It returns error (2100).  Has anyone experienced this before and/or is aware of a solution?
