How to install Tor from source on OS X <body> Need to install tor on Mac. Downloaded tor.tar.gz file from torprogect.org. Tor version is 0.2.7.6. Os X 10.11.3. On torproject.org said that it has to be configure with: ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; src/or/tor. Don't know what does that mean. How do I proceed?  <answer226646> *.tar.gz files are gzipped archive files. To unzip/unarchive the file simply double-click it. This will invoke Archive Utility and the file will be extracted to a folder (usually with the same name as the archive).  To build any tool from the sources Xcode and/or Xcode Command Line Tools are required.  hr  Open the README file and check the build instruction. The readme mentions:      To build Tor from source:br                 ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install   Then open Terminal and navigate to the folder: codecd ~/Downloads/tor-0.2.7.6/code  Enter code./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install/code to configure, make and install tor. You may have to prepend sudo to make install it.  You have to install additional packages like libevent, openssl and probably some other to build it successfully.  To run tor simply enter codetor/code in the shell.  hr  Alternatively you can skip the em&amp;&amp; make install/em and just run code./configure &amp;&amp; make/code. Other packages - like mentioned above - are still needed.  Then tor won't be installed to /usr/local. You still can run it in the build folder using src/or/to  strongI doubt that the above instructions successfully build tor after installing all required libraries/packages/tools (which will probably mess your system) because they target Linux./strong  hr  So I recommend to install a packet manager like Macports or Homebrew and install tor with one of both.  <answer226651> h1Tor Browser/h1  Have you considered using Tor Browser instead of codetor/code?     The Tor Browser lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained (portable).   h1Still need codetor/code? Use codebrew/code/h1  You can use the homebrew project to install tor on your Mac.  ol liFollow the instructions on homebrew to install the codebrew/code command:  ul liLaunch strongTerminal.app/strong/li liPaste in the one line command from brew.sh:   precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre/li /ul/li liRun the following command to install codetor/code and any dependencies:  precodebrew install tor /code/pre/li /ol  h2Easy Removal/h2  If you decide later to remove codetor/code, you can use the command:  precodebrew uninstall tor /code/pre  Alternatively, you can probably use MacPorts.  <answer226683> If you want to browse the web anonymously, then Tor Browser works great. Having tor installed will be just a waste of time. However, if you want the ementire/em network traffic routed through it, than tor is necessary.  To install tor I also recommend homebrew (see @Graham Miln answer).  But that's not it, if you want to route the entire network traffic through tor, you must also edit the Network System Preferences and add a new Location for tor.  A quick guide to do so:  ol liOpen System Preferences and the Network/li lifrom the dropdown menu Location, click on Edit Locations, then the + sign and name it Tor (or whatever)/li liGo to Advanced, then Proxies. Put the checkmark in SOCKS Proxy and add the following values: emSOCKS proxy server/em  emlocalhost/em and emPort/em  em9050/em./li liClick "OK" and then "Apply" and exit the System Preferences./li /ol  Now to actually use Tor, you must click on the Apple Menu, Locations and then the newly Tor location. Also you must run 'tor' in the Terminal. When the Terminal says that Bootstrap is at 100%, you're good to go and you can check (e.g. Safari) is running through Tor by visiting check.torprojects.org  Do not close the Terminal window while you're running Tor.  To quit Tor, do CTRL+C in the Terminal and then revert Location to Automatic.  <comment275209> Please can you edit your question and mention what tool or file you would like to install on your Mac. `tar.gz` files can contain any contents and without knowing more, answers will likely be unhelpful. <comment275225> The instructions will have the problem of required libraries but the ./configure && make etc should work as is standard Unix predating Linux (however many developers don't realise that Linux is not fully Unix and so miss things)
