What is the location of the webcam driver in macOS 10.12? <body> No matter how hard I try, I am unable to find the kernel extension of the FaceTime HD camera. Is there any specific location for it? Is it even accessible? I'm using a MacBook 13 inch early 2015. I just want to see when was it last modified. Does system integrity protection prevent third party drivers to work? And what is the name of original extension, and how to find its date of installation?
