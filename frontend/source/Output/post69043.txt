Mac Mini boots with bad display settings after it was turned off for a while (Mountain Lion) <body> I got a emMac Mini (Late 2009)/em and a emSamsung SyncMaster P2470LHD/em and this seem to happen emevery/em time it’s left off for some time. On the first boot the screen resolution is always wrong: the Dock will be cropped a bit and fonts look fuzzy. Oddly, also the wallpaper changed in the beginning. After I deleted the preferences file for the display and wallpaper settings the wallpaper stays the same.  (What it looks like)br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/orHJj.png" alt="Artist’s impression of the bad screen resolution"  It’s not possible to change the settings to the correct resolution before rebooting. Any settings will look bad on the screen. And, interestingly, the display settings change after the reboot.  (Before)br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNCxp.png" alt="Before reboot" (After) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQSu7.png" alt="enter image description here"  I experience this problem since I updated to OSX Mountain Lion and I already deleted the PRAM. I also tried to delete the files in codeSystem/Library/Display/Overrides/code as I read in a solution to a similar problem but it didn’t help either.  I wonder why this only occurs after the Mac Mini has been turned off for some time.  <comment80817> I have the same problem with my Mac Mini (2011) and a Samsung SyncMaster c226CW, each time I reboot. The odd thing, is that the problem is intermittent - it was there on Lion, then went away, now with Mountain Lion, it's back. I don't have a clue about what caused the change, but I'm getting wrong resolution each boot of the Mac Mini. Clearing NVRAM/PRAM doesn't seem to help. <comment80891> Did you already try to reinstall the system?
