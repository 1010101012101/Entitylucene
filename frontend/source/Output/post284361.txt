System Preferences error: "There was an error in Security & Privacy preferences" <body> When I open System Preferences (version 14.0) and then click on Security &amp; Privacy, I get a popup error message:     Preferences Errorbr   There was an error in Security &amp; Privacy preferences.   I am using macOS Sierra Version 10.12.4 (16E195) on MacBook Air (Early 2014), 1.4 GHz Intel Core i5, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, Intel HD Graphics 5000 1536 MB  System Preferences info:   precodeVersion:    14.0 Obtained from:    Apple Last Modified:    4/12/17, 18:59 Kind:    Intel 64-Bit (Intel):    Yes Signed by:    Software Signing, Apple Code Signing Certification Authority, Apple Root CA Location:    /Applications/System Preferences.app /code/pre  I've changed the language setting, time setting, etc. over the course of use. I don't know much about programming, but I've used Terminal to change some settings manually. I've also deleted some files I needed a password to delete, to get rid of iTunes. Because I felt like it. I've logged in on another account on the same MacBook, and encountered the same issue with System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy.  I've already tried restarting, logging in/out. I've also noticed that I seem to be able to open any other icon in system preferences. The issue seems likely not my fault, given it is on both accounts. It is good to note that I've used command line to try to reveal hidden files and stuff, but I don't think that's it.  I was, in both logins, in an admin account with a password.

I would head into Recovery Mode &amp; reinstall OS X on top of your existing install - note that this will not cause any loss of data or user accounts, but will reinstall iTunes.  <comment358605> Does your account have admin rights _and_ a blank password, by chance? <comment358626> Tried that. Have the exact same problem. I did the âŒ˜-R reset, but still have the same problem. I got the same error messages, but for some reason cannot copy paste them. I also can no longer open .txt files with TextEdit.app, and my aliases no longer display with icons. Also, I cant click on things without icons on the invisible icon, but can only click on iconless files by clicking on their text description. "TextEdit cannot open files of this type" text files now open with safari, which does not to text editing, hust display. <comment358627> Fixed above problems by going into safemode and opening up the invisible files. Can copypaste again, can display icons, and .txt files open as expected. I sill cannot open System Prefs  Privacy & Security though. <comment358788> Because it works in Safe Mode we can be almost certain that an application, kext or very strange (corrupted?) setting is causing it. All Safe Mode does is disable all non system kexts. This is something that probably exists in both of your respective user accounts. Try it out in a new user - it seems like it will probably be resolved there. If that's the case, sometimes it is easier to migrate a user account manually (copy only necessary applications & files) a backup won't be good here because it would restore the problem app.
