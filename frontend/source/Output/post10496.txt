Uncompress (zlib) files that "S3 Backup" compressed to Amazon S3 <body> On windows I was using "s3 Backup" to backup files to amazon s3. One of the options is to compress with zlib.   As far as I can tell there is no mac version of this app. So now I need to figure out how to uncompress those files as I bring them on my mac. Anyone know a good way to uncompress files that were compressed with zlib?  The files retain the same name and extention after they had been compressed. I tried adding different extensions to the ends of the files to see if some standard compression programs would uncompress them but they did not.  I have also tried messing around command-line with the "uncompress" command. But no luck there either. Unless I can figure out a way to uncompress them I will be force to re-upload everything to amazon with compression off.   thanks in advance  <answer10497> zlib compression is built in to Mac OS X.  If the files are not automatically unarchived, you can try the following to unarchive them:  Add a code.zip/code extension and open the file. This should do the trick. If it doesn't, try the following.  Open Archive Utility (/System/Library/CoreServices) and go to File- Expand Archive. brNavigate to your file and let it do its thing.  Let us know how this works for you.  <answer10506> To help figure out what these files are compressed with, you can try using the codefile/code command from the terminal. It should give you output like this:  precode% file archive.zip  archive.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract % file archive.tgz  archive.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Wed Aug  3 06:21:00 2005, max compression % file srchive.bz2 archive.bz2: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k /code/pre  <comment11011> certainly a good idea. When I do that the file that is outputted is is a ".cpgz" file? it also seems to be associated from an archive.. if I un-archive that I get a zip file! which then un-zips to a cpgz file. around and around in  a circle. <comment11016> I think zlib is gzip ie .gz files not .zip so try this rename and/or use the Unarchiver.app <comment12948> I never knew about that command -- thanks! <comment12963> Additionally, if you still want to use Amazon S3 on your Mac, one of the best alternatives I've found is Arq ($): http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/ The Developer is friendly and you can even ask him if there are chances of reusing your data.
