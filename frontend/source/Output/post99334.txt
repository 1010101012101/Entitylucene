TextMate/TextWrangler Document Reverts <body> This happens to me when I'm editing a document (usually a Javascript script) in TextMate (1 and 2) and TextWrangler.   I have this document open in another app, and in certain occasions, the document within TextMate/TextWrangler would revert itself to the previously saved versions whenever I hit Cmd+S. This is very annoying as my changes are basically gone.   I'm pretty sure both TextMate and TextWrangler are not sandboxed. The version of TextWrangler I have is the one from the Mac App Store.   Anyone has any workarounds for this?  <answer102108> For TextWrangler there is a setting in the preferences â€” it's the second from the top in the following screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SGj1B.png" alt="TextWrangler settings. "  There is probably a setting in TextMate too, but as of version 2, it's probably a codedefaults/code setting, since almost everything has ben stripped from the preferences GUI.
