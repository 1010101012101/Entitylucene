How to install Visual Studio Code's `code` command permanently? <body> I just followed the top-voted answer here and successfully installed Visual Studio Code's codecode/code command in my terminal.  However, the codecode/code command fails to launch Visual Studio Code every time after I restart my MacBook Pro.  precode~ code zsh: command not found: code /code/pre  Is it possible to install codecode/code permanently so that I don't have to install it every time I turn on my MacBook Pro?  precode~ where code /usr/local/bin/code  ~ ls -l /usr/local/bin/code lrwxr-xr-x  1 myName  admin  167 Aug  5 13:41 /usr/local/bin/code -&gt; /private/var/folders/bh/525lnbns1213cx2651s97my00000gp/T/AppTranslocation/EA379FC4-05D2-4739-BE49-1D8870E47B8A/d/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code /code/pre  I also find out that the folder codeEA379FC4-05D2-4739-BE49-1D8870E47B8A/code get deleted after I restart my laptop.

The solution works. I found that my `Visual Studio Code.app` was in `Downloads` folder. The `code` command is installed in `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code` after I dragged it to `Applications` folder.
