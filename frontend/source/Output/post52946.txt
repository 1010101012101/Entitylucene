Windows XP Server needs reboot to be discoverable with OS X Lion <body> I'm really not sure whether this is a Mac question or a PC question, so I will cross-post to both SE sites (see this Super User post). I'm expecting it has to do with how the PC is configured, but if anyone has experience connecting to a Windows XP fileshare from Mac OS X Lion, please share your experiences.  I can connect to the Windows XP shared drive from my OS X Lion Mac emif/em the Mac was booted up embefore/em the Windows computer. If the Windows PC was left on and the Mac was rebooted, then I have to cycle the Windows PC in order for it to become discoverable under the Networks icon.   What do I have to do to allow the XP computer to be discoverable at all times?   <comment60540> Can you provide a link to your cross-post? <comment60560> Okay. Done. http://superuser.com/questions/433035/how-to-make-windows-xp-computer-discoverable-to-a-mac
