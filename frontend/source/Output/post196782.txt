Re-numerate selected tracks in iTunes <body> I often do the same job: select each track in selected set of tracks, open Properties of track and set the number of the track.  I am just wondring may be there is a script or plugin for iTunes to re-enumerate tracks.  For example, I have tracks:  precodeNumber of Track     Song Name ---------------     ---------       1               Song A       2               Song X       5               Song Y       8               Song S      12               Song H /code/pre  I want to select tracks 5,8 and 12 and enumerate them like this:  precodeNumber of Track     Song Name ---------------     ---------       1               Song A       2               Song X       3               Song Y       4               Song S       5               Song H /code/pre  Is there a way to automate this task?  <answer199091> Try this...  precodetell application "iTunes"     set iSel to selection      set n to 1      repeat with trk in iSel         set track number of trk to n                 set n to n + 1     end repeat end tell /code/pre
