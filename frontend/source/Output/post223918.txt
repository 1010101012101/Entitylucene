Problem with BootCamp 6.0.1 El Capitain <body> I have a MBA mid-2012 running the latest OS. I'm trying to BootCamp a Windows 7 x64 .iso I retrieved from an old hard drive. I copied it on my MBA and every time I try to get BootCamp running, it will mount the .iso, resulting in a beautiful :"Your bootable USB device could not be created." error. I tried unmounting the .iso but BootCamp keeps bringing it back up each time. Also, I tried PRAM/SMC reset, different USB/.iso, pretty much all I could think of. Help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks   <comment271467> The main problem is that Boot Camp 6 will only install Window 8 upwards. You need [Boot Camp 5](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1720?) for Win 7 64, or [BC 4](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1636?) for 32-bit. <comment271534> Weird. I also tried installing a Windows 10 .iso and got the same error. I will try downloading BootCamp 5 and see if it fixes anything! <comment271536> Update : I have tried downloading the Boot Camp 5 files you linked and then running the last BC option (Install Windows 7 or later version) and I get an error again :"The installer disc could not be found." Even though my .iso is definitely mounted, I still can't proceed. This is getting on my nerves badly. <comment271538> You sure it's formatted MBR/FAT, not GUID? <comment271548> Yes, I formatted it multiple times to just that format to no avail.. I'm losing it <comment271550> Do you think I could de-install and re-install BootCamp Assistant? It might repair anything broken
