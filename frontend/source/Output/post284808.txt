Restoring backup from iCloud not working <body> I have an iPhone 5s on iOS 10.03.1. I selected the option Restore From iCloud Backup. Then, I chose the recent backup to restore to my iPhone, and entered my Apple ID and password. It showed the time remaining, for example '4 minutes', and then 'incomplete restoring from iCloud' and showed the error (cannot restore backup). What should I do?  <comment359149> Welcome to Ask Different.
