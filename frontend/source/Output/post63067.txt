What simple text editors exist that do not convert files as TextEdit does? <body> Is there a simple text editor like Notepad (or Notepad++) on Windows for OS X? TextEdit cannot open all types of files and TextWrangler is not "simple", for my opinion TextWrangler is meant to work with projects not simply single files.   I want to open emany/em types of files and see their source/binary code. Then I want to be able to save the file without any auto converting (as TextEdit does).  <answer63069> Textmate 2br Sublime Text 2br Subethaeditbr smultron  <answer63077> I think the closest equivalent would be NovoEdit.  I find NovoEdit to be an extremely simple, yet helpful text editor when it comes to handling any kind of file.  This reminds me of Windows' Notepad.  And although I agree with @CajunLuke on the fact that TextEdit emis/em able to open anything by forcing it to, I see myself using NovoEdit far more often than TextEdit simply because of its speed and ease-of-use.  <comment72802> TextWrangler's no more complicated than Notepad++, and I'd say a good sight less complicated - it has neither the plugin system nor the custom syntax coloring that Notepad++ has. <comment72803> Also, TextEdit will open any type of file you want - you just need to force it to (just like you would Notepad on Windows). <comment72804> Further, I'm voting to close this as Not A Real Question because you don't mention what features in TextWrangler you find complicated or what sorts of files you work with. (Basically: give more detail.) <comment72816> Good choices, but not less "complicated" than TextWrangler, whatever that means. <comment72818> It's hard to answer this without explaining what "simple" means â€“ I see you don't want TextWrangler to be the answer, but I can't figure out by what criteria you rule it out. Perhaps you can clarify and we can reopen the question. <comment72820> I agree, and since I was unable to understand how he found Text Wrangler "complicated", I threw out some other easy-to-use GUI based editors /shrug <comment322471> You forgot [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases).  Obviously that's much less complicated than TextWrangler.  ;)
