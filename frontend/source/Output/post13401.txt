AppStore stopped working <body> Today I wanted to download a emfree/em application from the AppStore.  First it wanted me to review my account settings, I accepted the license, then filled out the empty fields and it asked for my payment settings. Since I don't have US payment method, I had to switch to the Hungarian store, because strongno payment/strong was not an option there.  They charged me (for around $4) and switched me to the Hungarian store. Later I could set it back to the US store with iTunes where I could check the strongno payment/strong option.  So I have an US account again.  But since then I could not download any application. It starts to download it, finishes the progress bar and then this alert window appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L50aM.png" alt="The application could not be downloaded."  Of course there is no problem with my Internet connection.  The application is installed nevertheless but the AppStore application could not see it as an installed app so I could not check the updates for it.  strongUpdate:/strong In the code/var/log/install.log/code it seems the installation has been finished:  precodeMay  4 09:33:16 krtek installd[14760]: PackageKit: ----- Begin install ----- May  4 09:33:16 krtek installd[14760]: PackageKit: request=PKInstallRequest &lt;1 packages, destination=/&gt; May  4 09:33:16 krtek installd[14760]: PackageKit: packages=(\n    "PKLeopardPackage &lt;file://localhost/Users/raszi/Library/Application%20Support/AppStore/414445104/mzm.cufsjzsc.pkg#com.most-advantageous.windowflow.pkg&gt;"\n) May  4 09:33:16 krtek installd[14760]: PackageKit: Extracting file://localhost/Users/raszi/Library/Application%20Support/AppStore/414445104/mzm.cufsjzsc.pkg#com.most-advantageous.windowflow.pkg (destination=/var/folders/zz/zzzivhrRnAmviuee+++++++++++/Cleanup At Startup/PKInstallSandbox-tmp/Root/Applications, uid=0) May  4 09:33:17 krtek installd[14760]: PackageKit: Shoving /var/folders/zz/zzzivhrRnAmviuee+++++++++++/Cleanup At Startup/PKInstallSandbox-tmp/Root (1 items) to / May  4 09:33:17 krtek installd[14760]: PackageKit: Registered bundle file://localhost/Applications/WindowFlow.app/ May  4 09:33:17 krtek installd[14760]: Installed "WindowFlow" () May  4 09:33:17 krtek installd[14760]: PackageKit: ----- End install ----- /code/pre  strongUpdate2:/strong  Moving away ~/Library/Application Support/AppStore/ did not help the problem, update still not working:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tJtvC.png" alt="An error has occurred"  <answer14020> The strongReset cache/strong solved my problem in the iTunes advanced preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5IYa.png" alt="iTunes Advanced Preferences"  Since then I can install and upgrade applications from AppStore.  <comment14398> This sounds like a bit of a convoluted situation that might benefit from App Store account support -- they are known to be very helpful: http://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/contact.html?form=account&topic=Mac%20App%20Store%20Account%20and%20Billing
