15" MBP Video Card Issues causing the boot sequence to hang....? <body> Good day, sorry for the lengthy title.  I have come into a bind lately. My fathers 15" MBP has been acting slow (graphics card problems and all) and we decided to get a solid state drive for him. I downloaded El Capitan on my 13" MBP and then made a bootable flash disk using DiskMakerX. We then took out the old HDD of the 15" and placed the SSD in, plugged the bootable flash drive and then booted from there.  Thats when the problems started to show up. The 15" seemed to have a tough time booting from the flash drive, we couldnt even get to the part where we can choose any of the utility programs.  What we did next was we slapped the new SSD on my 13" MBP and then we installed El Capitan from there. The installation went smoothly and we even installed gfxCardStatus and set it to use integrated only so that when we transfer it to the 15", it wouldn't have gfx card problems anymore.  (It used to have problems using the dynamic switching option, it tends ro screw up when it uses the Discrete Card. We think it was caused by underrated power when we unknowingly switched chargers.)  After that installation, we returned the freshly installed SSD to the 15" and  turned it on. The boot progress is stuck at around the halfway mark. We turned it off and then returned the SSD to the 13" to check if it still boot and it does. However, we noticed that the gfxCardStatus is back to the default Dynamic Switching. We placed it back to integrated and reset the 13". However, gfxCardStatus is back on Dynamic Switching, and not Integrated.  It seems like the video card issues is causing the boot progress of the 15" MBP to get stuck.  Does anyone have any ideas? Any lead will be very much appreciated.
