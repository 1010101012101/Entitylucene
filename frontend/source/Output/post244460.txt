How do I put a password to stop the download of an app <body> I have an iPad for my children and I want to stop them downloading the YouTube app. Can I put a password on their iPad to stop them downloading it.  <answer244461> You can prevent them from accessing the App Store by restricting access to it:  strongSettings/strong -- strongGeneral/strong -- strongRestrictions/strong  A passcode needs to be set, keep it at a safe place as any other password.
