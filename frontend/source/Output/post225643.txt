OS X installer booting instead of Macintosh HD <body> Accidentally closed MacBook Pro while installing El Capitan. Now only bootable disks are my bootcamp, Recovery, and OS X installer. Macintosh HD shows up in Disk Utility and I've tried repairing it, no errors. On the properties it shows that it isn't bootable, that's it.  <answer225652> Just install the system again: it shouldn't overwrite any files outside of the system.  <comment273850> Is there a reason that you can't just erase the partition and start over? <comment273859> recently got some data that I do not have a backup for. I can erase it, just not ideal so was wondering if there is a way around doing so. <comment273860> So you were upgrading to El Cap from a previously-functioning OS? <comment273869> are you sure? it looks awfully like it would be a fresh install... doesn't say so though. <comment273876> yes, everything was working fine <comment273877> If you're feeling unsure, boot into the installer, open disk utility, and image the disk to some other external volume. If anything goes wrong, you have a copy. <comment273892> it says there is not enough space on the disk. any suggestions? I'm assuming there's no way to delete stuff on the disk from the situation we are in right now. <comment273916> @PravarKapoor you could put the OSX installer on a USB <comment273930> @PravaKapoor I believe you can access a terminal and remove files from there, I'll check later. Remind me in about 12 hour if I forget. <comment274040> @PravarKapoor Yes, you can indeed. [Here's a list of stuff you can do in Terminal.](http://www.howtogeek.com/189575/8-mac-system-features-you-can-access-in-recovery-mode/)
