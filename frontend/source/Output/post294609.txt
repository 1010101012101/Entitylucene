Cannot change permissions on /System/Library <body> I am running OS X 10.11.8. I am attempting to change some settings in code/Library/Filters//code. I am logged in as an administrator (verified in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups). When I go to Finder  Get Info for code/System/Library//code, I am able to click the unlock icon, and my password is accepted.  However, when I try to change the permission for "everyone," I get the following error:     The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have the necessary permission.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IHZUm.jpg" alt=""  How can I resolve this?  <answer295373> You'll need to disable System Integrity Protection to make changes to permissions in /System.     To disable System Integrity Protection, you can do the following:      ol   liBoot into the Recovery HD by restarting whilst holding ⌘R./li   liOpen Terminal (from the Utilities menu)./li   liRun the following command in Terminal:  precodecsrutil disable /code/pre/li   liRestart./li   /ol   Disable OS X El Capitan Rootless and permit write actions to System Integrity Protection locations  <comment371860> https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899 <comment371866> I've looked at this, but am not sure it applies. From the article "Paths and apps that third-party apps and installers can continue to write to include: ... /Library..." Thus, SIP shouldn't affect the library folder. <comment371871> Your screenshot isn’t from Library - it is from the System folder. <comment371881> Sorry, I didn't realize there was also a top-level /Library folder. I have updated my question. <comment371893> Library/Filters/ & System/Library are no proper paths. It's unclear whether /System/Library/Filters/  or /Library/Filters/ is meant. <comment371936> Yes /System is locked under SIP - you can however disable SIP, if you want.
