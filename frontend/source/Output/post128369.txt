infinite eject buttons appearing in menu bar <body> My menu bar automatically fills in all empty space with eject buttons. How can I remedy this problem? Is it a sign of a bug?  <answer128387> Actually it is a part of the Mac O/S. Just not documented and not on all versions of the O/S. You can find out easily enough.  Navigate to  /System/Library/Core Services/Menu Extras  ...and double click on Eject.menu to add the eject button (if it's there)  remove it by command-dragging it off the menu bar.  But why the menu bar fills up with eject buttons, sorry.  <comment150335> Please add a screenshot. <comment150349> What software are you running to put the first eject button in the menu bar? That's not a standard OS X control. <comment150364> move the Eject.menu file from /System/Library/Core Services/Menu Extras somewhere else and see if it still happens.
