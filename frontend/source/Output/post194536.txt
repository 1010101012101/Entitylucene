Disk structure error reported in Onyx but not fixable via the Disk Utility in Recovery Mode <body> On Yosemite 10.10 Onyx returns the following error:     Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed Underlying error:   8: POSIX reports: Exec format error   The disk needs to be repaired.   I tried repairing the disk in recovery mode but the disk utility returns a message that everything is fine, however, the after running Onyx the second time the error persists.  On a related matter, the option to emrepair permissions/em is not available in the Disk Utility.  <answer194547> Disk Utility will not fix every conceivable disk corruption issue. For that you need third-party apps. I use Diskwarrior and have also had success with Drive Genius.  However there is one way to do this without buying a disk repair utility. Back up your hard drive, partition/reformat it, reinstall the OS and restore your backup. Yeah it's more complicated and a bit of a PITA but will save you money.  <answer200813> I had the same issue.  I was able to fix it in an interesting way.  I have been testing El Capitan on an external drive.  So, I thought, why not try strongDisk Utility/strong using OS 10.11.x and (after the second pass) it repaired the drive.  As the Beta was on a separate disk, and the Macintosh HD was unmounted at the time, it was analyzed and repaired.  Just like using a 3rd party app.  At least this was a "free" way to fix it.  Saved the hassle of reformatting and restoring.  <answer213706> This was a problem for me too. I booted from an external disk (USB stick in fact), ran disk utility, then Onyx found no problems.  <answer239629> It because Disk Utility doesn't recognize all errors.   I had the same issue before, and I fixed it by following the instructions on the onyx's Known Problem page and this guide to run  precodefsck -fy /code/pre  under Single User mode  <comment232082> Thanks, I came across [similar post](http://superuser.com/questions/23478/unable-to-repair-disk-using-mac-os-x-disk-utility) and it appears that the *DW* is a highly recommended software. I was hoping that the error number `69845` would help to identify the problem precisely. <comment241711> Same issue.  I'm keeping an eye on this one. <comment241717> Out of curiosity and trying to trouble shoot for both of us, what is your current hardware? Mine: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) 251 GB Flash Storage. <comment258070> May be worth trying, did you create [Recovery Disk Assistant](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201372) on your USB?
