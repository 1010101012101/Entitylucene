start.command permission denied even after chmod <body> I have been trying to run my server.command file forever. I have tried changing access privileges with codechmod x+u/code pressing enter then dragging the file into Terminal and pressing enter, but when I do, it says:     -bash: /Users/Alec/Desktop/Tekkit_Server_v1.2.9g/start.command: Permission denied   <answer198984> I think it's:    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codechmod u+x &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  rather than:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codechmod x+u &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  So try:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codechmod u+x /Users/Alec/Desktop/Tekkit_Server_v1.2.9g/start.command /code/pre  <answer198988> If you actually used codechmod x+u filename/code then here is the results of a sample from Terminal:  precode$ echo 'echo Hello World!' &gt; hello.command $ ls -l hello.command -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  18 Aug  5 14:24 hello.command $ chmod x+u hello.command chmod: Invalid file mode: x+u $ ./hello.command -bash: ./hello.command: Permission denied $ chmod +x hello.command $ ls -l hello.command -rwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff  18 Aug  5 14:24 hello.command $ ./hello.command Hello World! $  /code/pre  It just needs to be: codechmod +x filename/code  If you only want it executable for the User, then use: codechmod u+x filename/code  <comment238306> still says: -bash: /Users/Alec/Desktop/Tekkit_Server_v1.2.9g/start.command: Permission denied <comment238307> @Kipperbang12, What is the output from Terminal of `ls -l filename` where `filename` is the name of the file (including path if necessary)? <comment238308> this everything i typed: Last login: Wed Aug  5 19:29:46 on ttys000 Alecs-Air:~ Alec$ chmod +x usage: chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-a | +a | =a  [i][# [ n]]] mode|entry file ...  chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-E | -C | -N | -i | -I] file ...

However it looks like it has not been set executable... so do as I instructed in my answer. <comment238321> @Kipperbang12 The "Usage" message that `chmod` printed is telling you that you didn't use the command correctly, and offering a hint about how to use it correctly; specifically, you didn't tell it what file to modify. Try `chmod +x /Users/Alec/Desktop/Tekkit_Server_v1.2.9g/start.command` <comment238322> The u would be necessary if you only wanted the file to be executable for the owner. <comment238327> Despite `chmod x+u` being incorrect as discussed in the answers provided, you also seem to be missing the fundamentals of what you're trying to accomplish, because you're pressing enter to run the command immediately after `chmod x+u`, but you should be pressing space instead, then inserting the file path, so that the chmod has a path to execute upon.
