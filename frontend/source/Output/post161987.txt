MacBook Air running Yosemite won't shut down when external HDD connected <body> My MacBook Air won't shut down when an external hard drive is connected. The screen goes black, and the mouse pointer is still there. I think this started happening when I upgrade to Yosemite. Any suggestions as to how I might fix this?  <answer162035> Are you sure something is not still running...or something is preventing the disk from unmounting.  If there's a grey circle -- then it might be running fsck on the disk...  Now, another thread suggested:     Start Up in Verbose Mode using Command-V      Then issue: sudo shutdown -h now      Also, more /var/log/system.log   This should show you what's occurring as it shuts down.  The sudo shutdown -h now is equivalent to the Shut down menu option.  Also, try going into Disk Utility and manually click on the Unmount icon.  I would just want to see if it will unmount normally.  If it doesn't, then, I'm thinking SOMETHING is still using  the disk..
