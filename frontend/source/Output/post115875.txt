Spanish Dvorak Keyboard <body> Actually i am learning to write with the Dvorak Keyboard. In the system configuration for Language and Text i have three Dvorak options (Left, Right and Querty) but none for spanish (with 'ñ' and accents).  There are a way to configure Dvorak for spanish ?  <answer116562> If you hold a key down (like n) you should get a popup menu with accented versions (like ñ). Also the usual option deadkeys (option n, then n) should work.  An example of a custom layout someone has made for this is at  http://djelibeibi.unex.es/dvorak/  http://djelibeibi.unex.es/dvorak/ES%20Dvorak.keylayout  It is pretty easy to make your own with Ukelele:  http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele  <comment135631> If you hold a key down (like n) you should get a popup menu with accented versions (like ñ).

The usual way to do that is with the app Ukelele.  http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele
