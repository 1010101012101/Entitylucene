Where can I find/unbind control shift space? (^⇧ + space) <body> I read through all of the system-wide keyboard shortcuts in "System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts" and I could not find nor unbind the Control+Shift+Space macro for use by SkipTune's pause/play keybinding. I know how to bind it in SkipTunes, but it just shows me this:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UYc6Z.png" alt="Skip Tunes Error"  <answer227656> Macs containing a trackpad (i.e. MacBooks) or with a trackpad attached allow emChinese Trackpad Handwriting/em. The shortcut kbdctrl/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdspace/kbd shows and hides this trackpad.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4Zpo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have no clue what I have written.  To disable it enable Chinese Trackpad Handwriting and then disable/remove the shortcut for emShow/Hide Trackpad Handwriting/em in System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Keyboard.  <comment277484> (^⇧ + space) works for me in iTunes. You might have a look through your login items. <comment277496> Interesting, but I still don't know where the setting to disable the keybinding is. <comment277497> @JeffM Added description how to disable it. <comment277505> That did the trick! Thanks very much!
