Consolidate multiple instances of a java app into a single Dock icon (like Terminal) <body> I have a java app that ships as a .jar file (it's mqtt-spy in fact). Currently I run it by double-clicking the .jar file in Finder, or from the command line:  precode$ java -jar mqtt-spy-1.0.0.jar /code/pre  This opens the application window and a generic "java" icon appears in my Dock. However I often open several instances of this application, and this results in multiple instances of the generic "java" icon in my Dock.  I'd like to make this a bit tidier - I'd like to add it to my Dock as a persistent icon (so that it is available even when the app is not running), and make it behave like the Terminal icon (right-click, shows a list entry for each running instance, can switch to existing instances or launch a new instance). Therefore no matter how many instances I'm running, there is only ever one (and always one) icon in my Dock.  I'd also like to set a more visually appealing icon.  Is there a standard way to do this? If not, is there a way to do it with a script of some sort? Alternatively, is there a wrapper app available that will help me achieve this?  I'm using Sierra.
