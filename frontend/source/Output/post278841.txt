Is it OK to put a sleeping MacBook pro (Mid 2015) in your backpack and carry around? <body> Is it OK to put this MacBook Pro in my backpack to carry around? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z18UK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Appreciate hardware analysis.  <answer278859> The mid-2015 model is only available with SSD. I.e. you do do not have a hard drive with moving parts to worry about.  It is therefore safe to carry the MacBook Pro in your backpack and carry it around.  Just be sensible: don't drop the backpack, don't sit on it, etc.  <comment350976> So I guess the key is only the moving parts? What about the heat? Does mackbook accumulate too much heat while sleeping and in the bag? <comment350977> If you're worried about the MBP running (and generating heat) while in the bag, disable the [PowerNap](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204032) feature. <comment351119> @zlin No, it does not accumulate too much heat. Even if the software was defective and it did accumulate heat, the hardware has built-in protection that disables the software before it becomes a real problem. <comment351126> @jksoegaard good to know that. Thanks.
