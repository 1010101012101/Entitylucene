What is a MIDI Network Directory, and why is the connection refused? <body> I am for the first time attempting to sync my two computers running Ableton Live using the OS X virtual MIDI Network driver over Thunderbolt.  The connection works if I use the emMIDI Network Setup/em option em"Who may connect to me/em" set to codeAnyone/code. But if I set it to codeOnly computers in my directory/code,  I get the error message:      strongem(IP address) refused the connection request./em/strong   Questions:  ul liWhat is the MIDI Network Setup Directory?/li liWhy do my two computers see each other in the emDirectory/em menu box, but can't connect unless the option is set to codeAnyone/code? Computers seeing each other in the box suggests to me that they are in the same Directory, but apparently they are not. Or if they are, what could be the issue?/li liIs it safe using the setting codeAnyone/code? I ask because the computers primarily connect via Thunderbolt, but they are also on the same Wi-Fi network, and I wish to keep that network as safe as possible from outsiders./li /ul  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FcRoh.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongemNote/em/strong: To get to MIDI Network Setup, open the application emAudio MIDI Setup/em and in the menu bar select emWindow → Show MIDI Studio/em (kbd⌘/kbd + kbd2/kbd) and then double-click on the emNetwork/em icon.
