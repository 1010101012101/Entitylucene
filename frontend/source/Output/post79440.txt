How to search for empty emails in Apple mail? <body> How can I filter email messages with no content in Apple mail?  <answer83952> ul liIt's not possible to make a rule with an empty field in Mail.app on OS X apparently. The solution I found is to list all vowels as necessarily missing in order to process the message (in this example case, move it to the trash)./li liNote: this does not deal with images or attachments of any type as the sole content of the message body however. An attachment emdoes/em count as 'content' in the message body. The rule(s) and criteria would have to be quite extensive to deal with attachments in addition to non-character message content./li liSee image:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F46RN.png" alt="enter image description here"
