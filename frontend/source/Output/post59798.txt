Apache 2 `UserDir` problem in OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) Server after upgrade from Lion (10.7) <body> I had a Mac under OS X Lion. I upgrade it to Mountain Lion, and buy the emOS X Server/em software in the emAppStore/em.  Since the beginning, I use the Apache version bundled in Mac OS, and it work fine.  But after solving some problems (like the change of location of the main directory from code/Library/WebServer/Documents/code to code/Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default/code), I can't figure out how to configure codeUserDir/code to work again!  As explained here:     Please note - the Mountain Lion install removes the contents of the directorybr   code/private/etc/apache2/users/codebr   so if you counted on those configuration files working for you, oops.    So, I follow advices found here, and finally my file code/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf/code look like this:  precode# # UserDir: The name of the directory that is appended onto a user's home # directory if a ~user request is received.  Note that you must also set # the default access control for these directories, as in the example below. # UserDir Sites  # # Users might not be in /Users/*/Sites, so use user-specific config files. # Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf &lt;IfModule bonjour_module&gt;        RegisterUserSite customized-users &lt;/IfModule&gt;  &lt;Directory "/Users/*/Sites/"&gt; Options Indexes Order allow,deny Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  But, event after some codesudo apachectl restart/code or reboot, impossible to acces again to my codeUserDir/code code/Users/utilisateur/Sites//code through codehttp://127.0.0.1/~utilisateur/code  Can you provide me some advice for the configuration please?br Remember: I've installed the Server software from the AppStore.  Thank you in advance!  [EDIT] I also tried these recommendations: Mountain Lion, Apache, Sites folder, htaccess and mod_rewrite, but it dosen't help…  strong[EDIT 2] In response to the possible duplicate with "How do I get my user directory working for web sharing again?", I will say that in my case, it's not a codepermission denied/code, but a code404 Not Found/code. It is probably due to the concomitant installation of the emOS X Server/em application from the emAppStore/em, so, it's a distinct issue IMHO…br In fact, I've tested the solution provided, and it does not work at all for me./strong  <answer59836> It seems that the Apache configuration files in code/etc/apache2/code are not at all considered by the Apache version provided by the emServer/em application.  With the Server application, all configurations are in code/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/code  As the codeReadMe.txt/code of this directory says, the default apache configuration file is codehttpd_server_app.conf/code, and I just had to uncomment the line codeInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf/code in this file!  problem solved.  [EDIT] As notified by strongKristopher Johnson/strong, it may also be necessary to uncomment codeLoadModule apple_userdir_module/code  <answer66728> the answer is as follow:  you must to check if you have a file with the name .conf in this directory:  precode/private/etc/apache2/users/ /code/pre  by default I think you have the Guess.conf file with this content:  precode# cat /private/etc/apache2/users/Guest.conf  &lt;Directory "/Users/Guest/Sites/"&gt;     Options Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  If you have the user "macuser" and you want to use codelocalhost/~macuser/code URL, then you must create the codemacuser.conf/code with the correct information (Sites directory, probably code/Users/macuser/Sites/code). After the change you need to restart the apache process:  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  <comment68807> possible duplicate of [How do I get my user directory working for web sharing again?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58078/how-do-i-get-my-user-directory-working-for-web-sharing-again) <comment78734> The question is already answered, and this answer do not solve the problem at all because the Server App had moved the configuration files (as you can read in my solution). So, you replied without completely reading the question neither the answer... <comment154880> I found that I also had to uncomment the line that starts with `LoadModule apple_userdir_module ...`
