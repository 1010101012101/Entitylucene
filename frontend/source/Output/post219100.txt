Can a 15" Retina MBP running 10.11 (El Capitan) determine if the attached power source is using a MagSafe adapter? <body> I have a first generation 15" Retina MBP. Recently there have been times when it runs out of power even though I'm plugged in. I have tracked it down to charging being intermittent if anything but a MagSafe 2 power supply is being used.   It always seems to register and charge if the power supply has a MagSafe 2 connector regardless of if it is the smaller 45W charger meant for MacBook Air or the larger 85W charger meant for MBP.  If I use a Cinema Display with a MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adapter the light on the cable does not always turn on meaning it drains until all battery power is lost.  With 85W power bricks from older MBPs (both the original plastic and second generation metal L-shaped variants) and the MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adapter it seems to connect and charge less reliably as witnessed by no light or a very, very weak light.  Figuring the MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adapter could be defective I've also tried three different adapters with the same problematic results. I have cleaned all of the adapters to make sure they are free of debris the magnet may have attracted.  The only way to reliably power my laptop is to use a "native" MagSafe 2 power charger.  Is there a way for the laptop to know which kind of charger is being used and therefore not charge if it is not a MagSafe 2? If so is it a software setting or perhaps a hardware component on the MagSafe 2 port inside the laptop?   One additional datapoint, it is not uncommon for the connector to get emvery/em hot when plugged in. But 4 trips to the Genius Bar and leaving the laptop there for overnight diagnostics has only had the Geniuses say it may be hot but it isn't too hot and it will shut down automatically before any damage is done.
