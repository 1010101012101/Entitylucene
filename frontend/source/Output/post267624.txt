How can I prevent MBP shocks without original three prong extender? <body> I no longer have the original three prong extension cord for my MBP, and am experiencing the shock issue described by many other users.  I purchased a three prong travel plug and tried that, but it did not solve the problem.  Is there anything else I can do to solve the problem? I don't have access to an Apple Store, and can't modify the electrical outlets (if there is a grounding problem, for example).  Thanks.  <comment335834> It is a common misconception that these devices are earthed/grounded. They are not, whether there's a 3rd pin or not. They are double insulated, switch-mode supplies.
