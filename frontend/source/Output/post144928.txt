iCloud Drive for Windows. When? <body> iCloud Drive is a file hosting service for devices running iOS 8, OS X Yosemite, or Windows 7 or later.  When will we be able to start using iCloud Drive in WIndows PCs? I can't seem t find that info anywhere.  <answer144932> A guess would be Sept 17, date of iOS 8 release; though that is just a guess.br It may be with Yosemite, for which no date has yet been announced, afaik.  "When it's ready!" might be a better answer ;-)  <answer145045> Try this, I believe it answers your question directly;  https://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/pc.html  <answer200932> Yes - the windows client is out and works well in my limited experience with it.  Install from http://www.icloud.com/icloudcontrolpanel and the setup guide is at https://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/pc.html  <comment170900> There is no mention of "iCloud Drive" at this link.  This is about iCloud control panel for PC, and has been available for a long time. <comment171810> You were right. iCloud 4.0 is appearing to me in the Apple Software Update <comment178173> It is irrelevant now, but it was released earlier then Yosemite was, by about a week maybe?
