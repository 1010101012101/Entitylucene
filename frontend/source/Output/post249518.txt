macOS sierra scrollbar issue <body> After upgrading to macOS sierra I've noticed that scrollbars are appearing always, even if I go to settings and then select codeappear when scrolling/code it still shows them and after quitting and going back to settings it reverts back to codeappear always/code. Is there any ways to solve this issue myself?  <answer251368> Go to "System Settings  General" and set "Show scroll bars" to "(o) When scrolling".  In my case, this setting was set to "(o) Automatically ..." after update and the scroll bars have been visible all the time.  <comment309529> It's beta software. It's probably a bug. We (generally) don't support beta software. <comment309536> As JMY1000 said, it must be a beta bug. I recommend to you report a bug with “Feedback Assistant” app, which is located in the /Applications/Utilities folder, in order to help Apple to fix it. <comment309767> @JMY1000 Yeah seems like that <comment309768> @Nestoraj I already did, thanks! <comment312569> Thanks, But I already did that as I said it didn't work, every time I change it goes back to appear always.
