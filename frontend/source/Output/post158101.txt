How to quit a file without modification & without changing its modification time? <body> Within my work I regularly open files with Pages, Numbers, Keynoteâ€¦ and even if I typed anything within these files I want to be absolutely sure I didn't modify them in any way. Moreover I want to be absolutely sure I didn't touch their modification time since I strongdidn't modify them in any way/strong.  Prior to Lion, this basic function was naturally achieved by using the codeApplication &gt; Quit/code function and answering codeDon't save/code to the window warning us of modifications made and not yet saved. This codeexit without save/code function didn't modify the file and didn't modify its modification time. This is an strongexpected behaviour/strong!  Since the change introduced with Lion, I have just recently discovered that I have some files which I scrupulously never modified which dates of modification have been changed strongwithout any warning/strong. I emsuspect/em these unwanted and unnounced modifications are coming from the auto-save function introduced with Lion. (The culprit is under heavy hunt.) hr How may I get rid of this nasty hidden function?  This other question deals with the auto-save function and the possibility to control it:br How to completely disable auto-save and versions in Mac OS X Lion?  But I have now a more serious problem (on Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks). Any codefind/code or other sort of audit of the file system is corrupted. How may I recover the original modification dates of all these files which were modified surreptitiously?
