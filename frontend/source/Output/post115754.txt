Is there a proper way to clean the iPhone screen? <body> Is there a particular proper way to clean the iPhone's glass, oleographic coated, screen in order to maintain its luster?  <comment135438> Screen protector? It seems like it would be either/or for any particular setup. <comment135439> Is my question doesn't fit here or needs revision? <comment135492> Take a look at my edit (and adjust accordingly if I missed your point). I improved the question to be Apple-specific. Also, take a look at this [question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1506/good-way-to-keep-ipad-clean): it may be helpful for you, and provide the info you are looking for. [Or this one has some good info](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6746/what-substances-i-can-use-to-clean-the-touch-sensitive-screens-like-iphone-ipad).
