Finding Apps on my iPhone <body> Where are downloaded apps located on my iPhone?  I went to download the Prisma App and the download page indicated that it was installed. Now I want to use the App but do not know how to find it.  <answer269269> Pull the screen down shortly like if you would like to scroll it down and on top of it the search field should appear. Start typing name of an app, i.e. Prisma and it should appear.  <answer269322> Swipe along the home screen and you should find it on the last page.   <answer269326> You can launch an app on an iPhone multiple ways.
