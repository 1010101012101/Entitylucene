Convert to lowercase:  code$ dd if=input.txt of=output.txt conv=lcase/code  or uppercase:  code$ dd if=input.txt of=output.txt conv=ucase/code  Tip: If you're working from the desktop then it may be easier to cd into the directory, rather than copying the file path or dragging and dropping the file into the Terminal window:  code$ cd ~/Desktop/code  <comment269974> What have you already tried? <comment269976> Conversions with `dd` only work for a-z/A-Z, not for characters used in other languages than english.
