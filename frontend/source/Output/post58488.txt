How to write on FAT32 and NTFS from Mountain Lion? <body> What is the best free software for OS X Mountain Lion for enabling write support for FAT32 and NTFS?  <answer58492> At the moment, the only free way for NTFS write access without using abandoned software is using NTFS-3G along with FUSE for OS X. There's a guide for that in the FUSE for OS X wiki.  If you need NTFS writing a lot you might be better off using Tuxera or Paragon, both commercial but more faster and more bulletproof solutions.  As pointed out in the comments, there's no write restriction for FAT32 volumes in OS X.  <answer76552> Try NTFS-FREE, works for me on ML:  This program allows MacOSX to access Microsoft NTFS formatted harddrives connected by USB port. A modified version of the original Linux code, this program is packaged as a easy-to-use installer so that normal users can install it without hassle  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ntfsfree/  <answer87222> Fuse4x + Ntfs-3g works on OS X Lion. All freeware.   ol liInstall Homebrew./li liIn Terminal, type codebrew install Fuse4x/code./li liNext, type codebrew install ntfs-3g/code./li liType codebrew info fuse4x-kext/code . Enter the 2 lines of code$ sudo/code code separately at the start of the text given./li liType codebrew info ntfs-3g/code . Enter the 2 lines of code separately after the line "To replace the default Mac OSX automounter:" .  /li liA restart may be prompted./li liDone. /li /ol  All the best.  <answer96097> As for me I use Paragon NTFS for Mac. Firstly, it is very fast, secondly, I can rely on it and I'm sure that it won't corrupt my files. Yes, it is commercial with 10-day trial but it is worth spending money. Moreover, it is cheaper than Tusera NTFS!  <comment67284> OSX can read + write to fat32, just NTFS is read-only (without some 3rd party software). If you use Win7 you could try to use exFAT (allows for files  4GB and is write- and readable on win7/osx <comment93665> This works without problems in Mountain Lion. It's free, which is always better than paying $20 ~ $30 for something so basic :) <comment101939> @mark - Let's keep them linked and open. Yes - the answers might overlap, but we can update Lion as versions change and keep this one current (for now) <comment107134> worked perfectly on 10.8.3 <comment130997> I made this work on OS X 10.8.5 (12F37), but it was clunky. I installed FUSE for OS X, then downloaded and compiled NTFS-3G _from source_ (`./configure && make && make install`), then ran `sudo umount /dev/disk2s1` and `sudo ntfs-3g -o rw,nobrowse /dev/disk2s1 /Volumes/MyNTFSDrive`. Also noteworthy: NTFS-3G requires that you mount the desired _partition,_ not the entire _disk._ <comment165531> This is the best option so far. Worked like a charm, simple install, hassle free.
