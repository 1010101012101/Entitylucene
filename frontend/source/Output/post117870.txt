Does installing Wireshark via homebrew provide a graphical interface? <body> I installed wireshark using homebrew with the command codebrew install wireshark/code. Everything seems to install fine and I can use dumpcap to capture packets but now I want to view them. Using a text editor like vi doesn't format some of the output very well due to an abundance of unreadable characters.   It looks like there should be a Wireshark.app to view the trace files with, however, I do not see how to start it.  Any ideas?  <answer117875> Type codebrew options wireshark/code to show the options provided with wireshark.   To install Wireshark with the UI :   precodebrew install wireshark --with-qt /code/pre  If you've already installed, you can use the codereinstall/code command instead. This should only download the required qt dependencies.  precodebrew reinstall wireshark --with-qt /code/pre  <answer128596> The new approach is to use codebrew install wireshark --with-qt/code.   The code--with-x/code option no longer works.

It calls up X11 on its own (which can take a while to start and make it appear as if Wireshark is broken).  <comment137701> No dice, when I try that I get ImportError: dlopen(./.libs/_giscanner.so, 2): no suitable image found.  Did find:     ./.libs/_giscanner.so: mach-o, but wrong architecture <comment147653> This worked for me. I didn't get the ImportError. It might be possible to try a clean build with the -universal option.
