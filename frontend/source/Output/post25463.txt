Two full screen apps in OSX Lion when using multiple monitors <body> Is it possible to run two full screen apps at the same time in OSX Lion when using multiple monitors?  <answer25486> strong[update]/strong  This has worked for me and others; it may take a couple attempts to get down.  ol liOpen an app (Safari, for example) and enter full-screen mode./li liNext, you will need to start another app without using the mouse (i.e. via Spotlight w/keyboard shortcut) kbdCommand/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd/li liWhen the Spotlight search box pops up start typing the name of the other app you would like to launch full-screen./li liAfter you have it highlighted press kbdEnter/kbd to launch the app and immediately start a gesture (using your mouse or trackpad) to switch spaces./li liAs you see your current space start sliding pause/stop your swipe halfway./li liIf you succeeded you should have a space that not really there (but is)./li liMoving to where the animation has jumped or stopped you should be able to see both spaces./li liYour second app should have opened in the original full-screen app's space and can be moved into the remaining unused space on the second display./li /ol     Since solution/work-around is possible through an apparent glitch in the gui, one of the apps doesn't show in   mission control or in the app switcher when you press command-tab.      Also, if you weren't able to achieve this via my instructions try these also.   strikeIt's currently not possible./strike The OS X Lion full screen API supports two monitors, and applications using the API can use additional monitors. However, it's not possible to run a full screen app on the main monitor and another app on the second monitor.  <comment28823> Related to: [Multiple monitors in lion](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18679/multiple-monitors-in-lion), [How do I run an app in Full Screen mode on OS X Lion on my second monitor?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17941/how-do-i-run-an-app-in-full-screen-mode-on-os-x-lion-on-my-second-monitor) <comment104545> I cannot get either method to work in OS X 10.8.x
