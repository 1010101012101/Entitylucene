Can I add my own commands/scripts to the mail.app toolbar? <body> Is there a way (or an add-on) that lets me customize the Mail.app toolbar beyond "View - Customize Toolbar"? At a minimum, I want to add buttons that do "Move to &lt;somefolder".  <answer11407> I think you can use Mail Act-on for this, it provides Shortcuts for doing stuff with various mails. Not a Visual Shortcut, but a Keyboard one.     Move messages by keystroke only Mail   Act-On’s interface includes the   ability to move or copy messages to   any folders by keystroke, even if you   don’t have an Act-On rule for a   particular mailbox.   http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html  Hope it helps,   Karl  <answer12525> Read CocoaDev: HowToAddButtonsToAppleMail.  It references a page of links to articles/examples on writing Mail.app plugins.  You will also need to do some programming of Mail.app, e.g. using AppleScript - which you can learn more about here.  Here is a year-and-a-half old blog post by a guy who managed to get some useful control over Mail.app from AppleScript.  You might use it as a model. He built his with a third-party module but you might find a way to write your own, if necessary.  The scripting of Mail.app might be stable.  However, from what I have read - the rules for how to construct a Mail.app plugin may be in flux from one major version of Mac OS X to the next.  That could be enough to discourage you from writing what you want for wide distribution but it might not be much of a handicap for personal use.  <answer102522> ol liOpen Automator /li liFile - New - Service - Choose/li liService receive codeno input/code in codeMail.app/code/li liFrom library select Utilities - Run AppleScript/li liInsert the code provided below and save under name codeMove to trash [Gmail]/code img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3xDec.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liEdit the script and change your account name.

But I guess you can create tiny applescripts, and bind them to keyboard shortcuts. <comment11765> Not really an answer to your question but maybe a workaround. You could use automator to add actions to the services menu <comment12000> Thanks, but I really want something visual. I have way too many keyboard shortcuts to remember as it is. FWIW, I use MsgFiler now, and it seems less intrusive than Act-On. <comment12001> To be clear, I really really want something that creates buttons on the toolbar: I don't want to memorize any more keystrokes. <comment13128> That does discourage me, yes. :-) However, it is the best we have seen, and it is probably the definitive answer, unfortunately.
