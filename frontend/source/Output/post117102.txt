Shortcut key to make my macbook sleep? <body> Is there a shortcut key to make a macbook sleep?  Sometimes I want to save time and just use the shortcut key to put it to sleep.  <answer117103> Supposing you're using an Apple Keyboard: kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdEject/kbd  <answer117104> h1Putting your computer to sleep/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3eJmt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Above is how to sleep your computer when it's on and logged in.   The keyboard shortcut is: kbdALT/OPT/kbd + kbdCMD/kbd + kbdEject/kbdbr(i.e., kbd⌥/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⏏/kbd).  br  h1Putting your display to sleep/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIMxT.png" alt="enter image description here"  Above is the keyboard shortcut for putting your emdisplay/em to sleep. The computer itself will not go to sleep, only the display will power off.  The keyboard shortcut is: kbdShift/kbd + kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdEject/kbd br(i.e. kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌃/kbd + kbd⏏/kbd).  br  hr  h3Note: Computers that lack the Eject key/h3  For computers that lack the kbd⏏/kbd key – e.g. MacBooks – the Power key (kbd⌽/kbd) can be used instead.   Also, it's possible to hold down the Power key for 1.5 seconds and then select from a menu if you want to emSleep/em, emRestart/em or emPower off/em. You can also access the menu immediately by kbdCtrl/kbd + kbd⌽/kbd.  <answer117115> Under Mavericks, pressing the power button puts your Mac to sleep. This behavior changed from previous versions of OS X when this button toggled the shut-down/sleep/restart menu. You can access this menu by pressing the button a little longer or pressing codectrl + power button/code.  <answer117205> I like the CTRL EJECT as it brings up a dialog allowing you to sleep, restart or shutdown, like so:  Pressing ENTER shuts down Pressing R restarts Pressing S sleeps ESC cancels  BTW if you have a PC keyboard with no EJECT key, use F12  <answer117352> If you have a keyboard with no eject or power key, you can use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::S, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::D, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::R, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Option-command-eject puts the Mac to sleep, control-shift-eject puts displays to sleep, and control-command-eject restarts the Mac.  <comment183578> This shortcut only puts your displays to sleep. The correct shortcut for putting your mac to sleep is Cmd+Option+Eject, as pointed out by Matthieu Riegler.
