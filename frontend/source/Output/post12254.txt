How can I "say" to another Mac? <body> I have two Macs in our house (iMac and MacBook Pro).  I would like to use the codesay/code command-line utility to type something on my MPB and have it speak on the iMac, rather like an intercom system.  Plus, it could be hilarious to send messages to my wife while she is using the iMac.  Can this be done?  <answer12256> Since the two Mac are in the same house, I assume they're both on the same network.  First of all, you need to activate codeRemote Login/code on the Mac where you want the sound out.  Go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Sharing/code and check the codeRemote Login/code checkbox. Then, using your computer, open Terminal and type this  precodessh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;computer name.local&gt; /code/pre  Where code&lt;user&gt;/code is your wife login and code&lt;computer name&gt;/code is the name of the other computer.  Now, it's as if you're having Terminal open on your wife's computer and you can codesay/code whatever you like.  <answer24553> In addition to using codessh/code to run commands on the remote host, you can use Remote Apple Events, which also have a codesay/code command, as well as others that may be useful to you, like codedisplay alert/code.  On the target machine, enable:     strongSystem Preferences  Sharing  Remote Apple Events/strong   Then from your machine run the following script (in AppleScript Editor, or via codeosascript/code in Terminal):  precodetell application "Finder" of machine "eppc://machine-name.local"     say "Hello" end tell /code/pre  It will ask you to authenticate when you compile or run this. If you do so in AppleScript Editor, it will remember the authentication as long as you leave AppleScript Editor open, so you won't have to authenticate each time you run this. (The authentication dialog also has an option to save your credentials on the Keychain to avoid being repeatedly pestered.)  You can do this from the command-line in Terminal with:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Finder" of machine "eppc://machine-name.local" to say "Hello"' /code/pre  strongHow to Display a Message on a Remote Machine/strong  You could also display a message by logging into the remote machine with codessh/code† and running this command in the remote shell (this doesn't make use of Remote Apple Events, just Remote Login for codessh/code):  precodeosascript -e 'say "Hello" without waiting until completion' -e 'tell application "System Events"' -e 'activate' -e 'display alert "Hello!"' -e 'end' /code/pre  The codesay/code command starts the speech asynchronously, then this brings System Events to the front to display the message while the speech is playing.  † Commands that display UI, like codedisplay alert/code and codedisplay dialog/code, are not allowed via Remote Apple Events. To send them to a process on a remote machine, you must first go through codessh/code.  <answer47066> Alternatively again, nothing stopping you from using Remote Desktop or Screen Sharing, which is built into OSX, and just logging in as a normal user, skipping the terminal.  Then you can use say normally. Or there are plenty of apps that do text to speech.  <comment12786> it says Event not found <comment12787> @cbmeeks when? what's the last command you did? <comment12788> nevermind.  I did it wrong.  works great!  lol  thanks <comment27570> I've done this before, when coding alongside a friend, great answer! <comment131222> Related: XKCD 530 http://xkcd.com/530/ <comment209918> You can combine the commands into a single line: `ssh user@hostname 'say hello'` <comment278353> This is so great!  Works perfectly and I cannot wait to startle my kids while they watch Minecraft videos! :)
