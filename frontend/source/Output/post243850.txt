Activity Monitor not displaying Chrome's Memory usage in MB <body> My Activity Monitor is not displaying Chrome's memory usage in MB. Instead, it lists some huge 20-digit number. In addition, both Real and Private memory is listed with the MB suffix (as well as all the other memory statistics listed in Activity Monitor).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o4PR1.png" alt="Chrome&#39;s memory usage??"  Does anyone know what's going on and how I can get back to displaying Memory in MB?  MBP running 10.9.5
