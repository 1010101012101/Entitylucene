How can I access my Time Capsule remotely with iCloud? <body> Before, with MobileMe, I was able to backup and access my Time Capsule anywhere in the world because I had my MobileMe login stored in my Time Capsule, and my MobileMe entered into my mac.  So when I was at home it would backup through the local network and when remote it did it through the internet.  Once upgrading to iCloud this broke (even though I entered my iCloud info into the time capsule).  Apple apparently fixed this with an update:  The latest Airport Base Station Update 7.6.1 "provides support for remote access to an AirPort disk or a Time Capsule hard drive with an iCloud account."  However, I'm still unable to do it. Is there instructions some where on how to do it with the latest Airport Utility / iCloud?  Note, yes I could do it with port forwarding but that would require that I have a static IP and like most all residential users I don't have a static IP and can't afford to pay 180+ for a business account to have one. And yes, you can use something like DynDNS but that only works if you have an extra computer at home and that its always on. I only have one machine and its my laptop that I bring with me. MobileMe acted like a DynDNS on the Airport to make Back2Mac work and supposively iCloud should do the same.  Also in Airport Utility next to my iCloud login it shows a green icon (so it's connected).  Thanks in advance!

Have you ruled out other things on this specific network that might be causing you to not access the router?  Firewall, IP address problem, routing problem, etc...  <answer70963> Make sure that you have a clear path to the Internet in terms of firewalls, and ensure that TCP port 5354 and UDP ports 4500 and 5353 are open and unrestricted.  Once you've done that, make sure you are logged into iCloud on your computer, and that the remote Time Capsule is on (also making sure those ports are unblocked on that end). Your disk should now show up via AFP in the Finder sidebar!

Yes, this is a 3 year old question. An easy solution to access a remote Time Capsule. (Maybe even a remote Airport Base Station - I couldn't test this.)

Disabled the firewall, and under file sharing on my mac added a user (me). Not sure which of those two solved it by now when on an external network under share in finder it shows the Time Capsule. Very slow, but works! No DynDNS needed. <comment52103> Please post that as an answer so you can mark this problem as resolved. <comment58644> bmike, see @heavymark's comment on the question. He resolved the problem already. <comment58645> I know - but the point here is to have answers in the answer bin. I'd rather the OP or anyone else step up and answer it. Jepoardy questions are OK - better than having it "unanswered" since someone new to the site won't know to look in the comments to "find the answer" <comment58646> Also - I'm answering in more general terms. Yes this one person had a firewall issue, but for the benefit of someone with the issue - it seems worth noting that this does work in general and list the three main things that I have seen break it of late.
