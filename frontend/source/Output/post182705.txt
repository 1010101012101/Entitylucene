OS X asking for local items keychain password <body> My mid-2010 macbook pro was running just fine on OS X 10.10, and then I decided to enable the guest account.  My account still works fine, but when I login into the guest account, I get an annoying dialogue box: codeOS X wants to use the "Local Items" keychain. Please enter the keychain password./code  Because this is the guest account, there is no password. So I don't know what to do to get rid of the box.  I tried following the instructions here, by going to Keychain Access Preferences and resetting the default keychain in the guest account, but it just said "Keychain Not Found."   Any suggestions?  <comment217869> Might be trying to connect to Wi-Fi? Alternatively is there anything you have set to start in the guest account that might need something from Keychain? <comment217871> I don't think it is trying to connect to wifi, since my wifi is broken and I don't have any saved wifi passwords anywhere on my Mac. I don't have any login items set, either on my account or on the guest account
