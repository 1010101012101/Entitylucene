How to force Fake.app to connect an HTML element by XPath (instead of "id" attribute) <body> I want to "connect" a Fake Action to an HTML Element on the page via strongXPath/strong, but when I try to connect the Element, the Element is specified by HTML codeid/code attribute instead.  How do I force Fake to specify an HTML Element by XPath when "connecting"?  <answer82068> Developer of Fake here.  First, make sure you understand the concept of "Connecting" in Fake.  Fake allows you to emspecify/em an HTML Element via one of several methods:  ol liHTML codeid/code attribute/li liHTML codename/code attribute/li liCSS Selector/li liXPath Expression/li liarbitrary JavaScript Expression/li /ol  strongConnecting/strong is an strongautomatic/strong way to emspecify/em an Element. Fake can only emconnect/em an Element using one of two methods:  ol liHTML codeid/code attribute/li liXPath Expression/li /ol  If you want to specify via one of the other methods you must do so em"by hand"/em.  When you emconnect/em an Action to an HTML Element, Fake will first try to emspecify/em the connected Element using the strongHTML codeid/code attribute/strong. If that is not possible (becuase the Element has no codeid/code attribute), Fake will try to specify the connected Element using strongXPath/strong.  strongVia codeid/code/strong is the default because it is efficient and easily understandable.  strongVia XPath/strong is the fallback because it is always possible, but less efficent and less easliy understandable.  hr  However, there are times when you might prefer to emconnect/em an Action to an Element, but emspecify/em the Element via XPath instead of codeid/code. This is possible via the steps below:  ol liFirst add a connectable Action (like codeSet Value of HTML Element/code) to your Workflow./li liemBefore/em connecting, change the emspecifier type/em to codefor XPath/code./li liThen connect as normal. Hold the control key (codeâŒƒ/code) while dragging from the Action to an Element on the page./li /ol  The Element will now be specified via XPath, instead of codeid/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WrauG.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gPz7L.png" alt="enter image description here"
