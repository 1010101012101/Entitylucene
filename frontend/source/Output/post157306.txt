iTunes cannot find music files after upgrading to Yosemite <body> After upgrading from Mavericks to Yosemite, most of my music files appear to have gone missing.  Whenever I try to play music on my Mac, a pop up shows up saying: em"the song you're trying to listen to could not be used because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it?"/em  And if I choose to locate it, the only thing that happens is the last Finder window I was in re-opens.  How do I get my music back?  <comment184944> Did you try to rebuild your iTunes library ? <comment184945> What do you mean by "rebuild your iTunes library"? <comment184949> seethis http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201561 your music files are still there just not connected to iTunes. <comment184951> or type .mp3 in finder search (dot)
