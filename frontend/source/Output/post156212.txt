Does the App Store update Java, if installed? <body> If I installed Java (or an older version), will the App Store update my local installation, even though I installed, and updated it outside of that?  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572  <answer156218> Java6 provided by Apple should be updated by the App Store, given any newer versions will be released (which i doubt).  (Tested with codeMavericks/code &amp; codeApple Java RE 1.6.0_51/code in a VM. It was updated to codeApple Java RE 1.6.0_65/code by codeApp Store/code)  Java7 &amp; Java8 provided by Oracle use their own update services.  <comment183711> Where and how did you install Java6? <comment183712> @klanomath I installed Java6 in the default path, supplied from the link (apple) above.  No other version of Sun Java is installed.
