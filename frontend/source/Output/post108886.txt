messed up .bash_profile while configuring PostgreSQL <body> I am quite new to Terminal use.  While installing and activating a local PostgreSQL server on my MacBook Pro (OS 10.6.8) I definitely messed up my .bash_profile (probably by messing around with user / superuser and password settings).   Actually I got the server running by entering:  codepsql -U postgres -p 5432 -d postgres/code  But I didn't get the additional plug-ins (PostGIS and osm2pgsql) to function, probably due to the messed-up profile.  After starting a Terminal session the following message is shown:  code-bash: export: /Users/Jop/.bash_profile': not a valid identifier/code  And the content of the .bash_profile is:  precodeexport PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH source /Users/Jop/.bash_profile alias psql=/usr/local/pgsql-9.2/bin/psql export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" source /Users/Jop/.bash_profile alias psql=/usr/local/pgsql-9.2/bin/psql export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" source /Users/Jop/.bash_profile alias psql=/usr/local/opt/postgresql/bin/psql alias psql=/usr/local/pgsql-9.2/bin/psql export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  Could anyone help me out? Many thanks in advance!  <answer108889> The newlines before the 'source' statements are missing, the 'source' statements should be on a new line.   Also, there are quite a number of duplicate and conflicting lines in your config (the psql aliases).  <answer108892> Seems messy.  Should be something like this I believe. Try it. Canâ€™t hurt it more.  precodeexport PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" alias psql=/usr/local/pgsql-9.2/bin/psql /code/pre  Then again, unclear on the codesource/code lines.  <comment127548> Those source lines can't be right, it would try to include .bash_profile from .bash_profile, infinite loop :) <comment127553> Thank you for your quick replies. It's clear to me that the whole thing is messed up. Anyhow, as a rookie on commandline stuff, could you please, if possible, do a complete rewrite of the relevant lines?  By the way: I guess I should change shells before editing the profile, right? Thanks.
