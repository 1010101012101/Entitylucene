How to configure StrongSWAN as client to VPN server running on Mac mini <body> I've set up a VPN on my Mac mini running Mac OS Sierra 10.12.1 and Server 5.2, and I can successfully connect to it from outside my house using my iPhone (using http://noip.com to give me a dynamic hostname).  I now want to connect to the VPN using OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05.01.  I've installed the strongxl2tpd/strong packages for the L2TP layer but I need to install StrongSWAN to do the IPsec bit.  I can find plenty of info on the OpenWRT wiki about configuring StrongSWAN as a server, but nothing about using it on a client.  Can anyone help?  My post on the OpenWRT forum is here.  <comment329141> This may help... There is a built in option in Attitude Adjustment that may still work. See http://vpnonline.pl/en/konfiguracja/openwrt-pptp <comment329142> Sadly that refers to PPTP configuration.  Apple dropped support for that, which is why I'm now using L2TP. <comment329145> What about this one? https://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/openswanxl2tpvpn <comment329167> Sorry @bret7600 that link describes setting up openswan as a server.  I need the client config. <comment329195> perhaps https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/connect_by_l2tp ? <comment329213> Sorry, no.  I asked about that link in my post on the OpenWRT forum.  I was told it's extremely outdated.
