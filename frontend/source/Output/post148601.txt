Recompiling bash to avoid shellshock seems to have messed up bash <body> I probably shouldn't have even messed with it, but I followed the instructions to recompile bash here: How do I recompile Bash to avoid Shellshock (the remote exploit CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169)?  Following that recompile, if I run something like wget from terminal, I get the following: -bash: wget: command not found  And that's not the only one. A lot of the usual bash commands seems to have disappeared for me. How do I do a complete revert of bash back to normal but with the current apple supported bash patch(es)? Is there a better way to fix my problem?   <answer148670> Well, codewget/code isn't installed by default on Mavericks. You could install it through homebrew though.  If you installed codewget/code yourself at one time then you may just need to adjust your code$PATH/code to emfind/em it again.  codePATH=/path/to/wget:"${PATH}"/code  Take a look in code/bin/code and code/usr/bin/code to see what tools are installed and try one of them to see if codeBash/code is working correctly.  <comment175016> I would just install the Apple bash update as per the main answer in the question you linked to http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/146851/237 <comment175082> This seems to be more of an issue with your `PATH` than with the shell. What does `echo $PATH`  return? <comment175085> patrix. I've been doing some stuff with python, so it seems to be this complicated path here which may indeed be the problem:  $ echo $PATH /Users/Luke/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/apache-maven/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin  At the same time, I'm not sure that I have wget installed, but I thought that I did. How can I easily check that, in light of this path?  $ which ls ; echo $? /bin/ls 0 $ which no_such_executable ; echo $? 1 <comment175088> Path looks ok to me, I would assume that you haven't install `wget` in the first place (run `sudo find / -name wget` and have a cup of tea whil it runs to verify). Which other "usual" bash commands seem to have disappeared? <comment175099> Turns out wget was not installed. Bash does seem to be working fine. Thanks for the help!  One final question regarding the bash-fix, can I remove the bash-fix folder in my root directory that the patching steps created? I would think so, but I've never done anything like this before. <comment175111> Your folder named 'bash-fix' can be removed. sudo rm -rf bash-fix
