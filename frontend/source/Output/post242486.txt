Ethernet Adapter Windows Driver - how to find for BCM5701 <body> I am having troubles with finding driver for my Apple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.  I checked the version and I have a BCM5701 chip. These Broadcom drivers don't support my adapter.   I want to get it working under my second PC Lenovo X1 Carbon with Windows 10 64-bit  Where can I find drivers to this ?   <answer242654> strongThis is for Windows 7, but should work for Windows 10/strong   A quick search on the Apple Support site, I was able to find instructions on downloading the correct driver.  I have condensed them here for quick reference:  hr  ol liDownload the Netxtreme Mobile/Desktop Driver.  strongIt will say that it's not supported, but the code.inf/code file does include the requisite driver entries/strong/li liUnzip the drivers to a temporary folder on your hard drive (preferably your Desktop so it's easy to find)/li liConnect the adaptor to the thunderbolt port /li liReboot Windows /li /ol  Windows should automatically detect the adaptor now and install it. You may need to point the installer at the location where you unzipped the drivers.   If that doesn't work, you will need to do this through emDevice Manager/em  ol liGo to Start  Control Panel  Hardware &amp; Sound and open Device Manager /li liClick the name of your computer at the top of the device tree /li liClick Action at the top of the window and choose Add Legacy Hardware /li liClick Next /li liSelect "Install hardware that I manually select..." /li liChoose Network Adaptors /li liChoose "Have Disk" /li liBrowse to the location of the drivers you unzipped earlier. /li liClick the .inf file /li liSelect Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet from the list of drivers available /li liOK and install /li /ol  You may need to reboot again with the adaptor plugged into the Thunderbolt port to finish the job  strongNote:  Again, these instructions and driver downloads are for Windows 7.  Thought they should work with Windows 10, it is not guaranteed./strong    If having both OS X and Windows 10 support is important, consider getting a USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.  I have personnaly used this exact adapter on an iMac, a MacBook Pro, a Mac Mini (Dual Boot w/ Win 7) and a Surface Pro 3.    <comment298294> Can you please add more details about your setup? Are you running Windows via Bootcamp, within a VM or another way altogether? What makes you think you'll need a driver? <comment298397> I try to use it on completly different computer, Lenovo X1 Carbon with win10 x64 <comment298398> Related: [Are Boot Camp drivers for thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet available?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/62283/are-boot-camp-drivers-for-thunderbolt-to-gigabit-ethernet-available)
