In Apple calendar the search function doesn't work for years 2013, 2014 <body> I use my calendar for business planning and need data also from 2013, 2014. But since recently the calendar search function doesn't work for those years. It works only for 2015 and 2016. What can I do to solve it?  <comment272461> What does "not work" mean here? Are there no calendar entries for these years or does the search function only return those for 2015ff (even if there would be a match for 2014 as well)? Also, which OS X version and where is your calendar stored (locally, iCloud, Gmail etc.)?
