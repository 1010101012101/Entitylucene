How to make OS X save password in the default keychain? <body> I have been using the Mac OS keychain since it was created with Mac OS 8.6 and I collected almost 4000 items. My default keychain has a different name than "login" and than my user name, and I moved it around over the years between a dozen or so Macs. It's a nice system.   With OS X 10.11 El Capitan I notice that OS X saves new passwords in the "Local Items" keychain, instead of the default keychain. This is a special type of keychain saved in a sqlite DB instead of the classic format and emI think/em also bound to the local machine. So my workflow where I could migrate keychains between machines is no longer working.   How to make OS X save password in the default keychain?
