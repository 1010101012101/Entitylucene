Enhancement for switching inside a program on OS X <body> Is there any software or tool that can give kbd⌘/kbd+kbd`/kbd a visual interface just like kbd⌘/kbd+kbdtab/kbd does?  <answer121896> Currently there is no option in OS X to give ⌘` a GUI interface. However, you can switch windows of an application using App Exposé.  ol liGo to System Preferences → Trackpad → More Gestures and enable App Exposé.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bK0zi.png" width="324"/li liUse the gesture to evoke App Exposé.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C4ywZ.jpg" width="500"/li /ol  Alternatively, you can install strongWitch/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHRCD.jpg" width="300"  <answer121902> You can set keyboard shortcuts for this (and more) in Preferences / Mission Control / Application windows.  KBDcontrol/KBDKBD⬇/KBD works for me in Lion but I'm not sure it's the default.  <answer181781> Well now I know an app called HyperSwitch which can achieve this. It is produced by the vendor of HyperSock.  <comment142153> I don't see CMD + ` do anything, what does it switch for you? Could you give an example? <comment142159> @Robuust, it switches between the windows of the same program (e.g. many safari windows open)
