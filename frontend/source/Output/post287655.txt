Error when attempting to create a windows 8.1 partition using Bootcamp <body> When I attempt to partition my disk and install windows 8.1 on the smaller partition using BootCamp, I get the error in the photo below. brI have also tried to install windows 10, which installs without error, but the windows applications I wish to install do not support windows 10.brI have seen many others onine with the same problem but I'm yet to find a simple solution.br How would I avoid or fix this error and install windows 8.1 on to a partition without going to extremes (downgrading to el captitan)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYRTj.png" alt="Error Message"
