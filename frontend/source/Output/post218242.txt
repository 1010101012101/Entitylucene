How can I split a 60 GB file into 5 GB pieces on a Mac? <body> I would imagine using a Disk Utility partition, but I didn't see the option in Disk Utility to split a larger partition into several.  How can it be done on a Mac?    I am doing this because I would like to Mail Drop the file.  <answer218243> OS X includes a command line tool called codesplit/code. See codeman split/code for all the details.  You can call codesplit/code using the strongTerminal.app/strong and the command:  precodesplit -b 5000m MYBIGFILE /code/pre  hr  To combine it again, have the receiver store all parts in a dedicated folder, open Terminal there and run  precodecat x?? &gt; MYBIGFILE /code/pre  (This assumes that you used the default output names when running codesplit/code.)  <comment264085> Will this work with an encrypted .dmg file? <comment264116> It will work with anything, the splitting doesn't care about the data getting split.
