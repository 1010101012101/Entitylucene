In the new Photos OSX app, where is the machine-readable photo information stored? <body> In iPhoto, there was an codeAlbumData.xml/code file with information about all the photos like title, filename, etcetera. I was planning to use it from within a Python program to automatically export photos in certain albums to my website.  With the new OSX Photos app, I cannot find an codeAlbumData.xml/code or a plist file with the same information. The code~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Database/apdb//code directory contains serveral code.apdb/code files, which are sqlite databases. I inspected the schema in two of them but didn't find any list of photos. (Note: "apdb" stands for "aperture db", so it seems Apple re-used quite a bit of aperture in the new Photos app.)  So... I want to get my hand on the filenames of my photos, their titles, which albums they're in. Where is this data stored?  (Googling is very hard because of the generic 'photos' search term...)  <answer188734> The "list of photos" is in the codeRKMaster/code table.  precodecd ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Database/apdb sqlite3 Library.apdb select modelId,fileName,imagePath from RKMaster; /code/pre  Do code.schema RKMaster/code to see the other fields of the table.  <comment223525> You're right, this is a list of files. It didn't contain titles, though. Apparently that's in the RKVersion table: `select name from RKVersion where name  '';` See also https://discussions.apple.com/message/27873467#27873467 . So... your answer gave me a good search term to investigate further. I'll need to dig deeper. <comment293300> Note: I found that opening them with sqlite 3.6 did not work, 3.12 did. And you might first need to copy them somewhere else to avoid a 'database is locked' error.
