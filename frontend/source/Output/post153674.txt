Paste format/style only? <body> In Google Docs there is a nice strongPaste Special  Paste Format Only/strong funtion; is there anything like this in Mac OS X?  If not by default, is there a way to get this?  <answer153698> Go to Format → Font → Copy Style (⌥⌘C) to copy the style of the currently highlighted text, then go to Format → Font → Paste Style (⌥⌘C) to paste the style.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PfGvR.jpg" width="609"  Some apps change the position of this feature, such as iWork, to simply Format → Copy Style.
