Fixing a failed full disk Core Storage encryption <body> I selected the encrypt disk option from the Finder initially, but after several days without progress (I checked codediskutil cs list/code and it didn't show that it was either encrypted or converting) I ejected the drive, plugged it back in, and tried again from the command line.  First of all, encryption status showed Pending and didn't change, so I tried encrypting it again to force it to start, but that didn't work and gave the error shown below.  I then tried decrypting and reencrypting. But I still get the following two errors (output cleaned up):  precode&gt; diskutil cs decryptVolume vol Error beginning CoreStorage Logical Volume decryption: The target Core Storage volume is not encrypted (-69755)  &gt; diskutil cs encryptVolume vol Error: -69696: The target Core Storage volume is already encrypted /code/pre  Apparently this was Schr√∂dinger's Hard Drive.  So then, I ejected it, unplugged it after ejecting, and plugged it back in. But now it doesn't mount. I tried unlocking from the command line, and I get this:  precode&gt; diskutil cs unlockVolume AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA Error: -69774: Couldn't bring the new Core Storage Logical Volume online /code/pre  From Disk Utility, trying to mount or unlock does nothing. For completeness, here's the complete output of codediskutil cs list/code:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-81XXXX92-XXXXXXXXXXXX     =========================================================     Name:         vol     Status:       Online     Size:         3000144142336 B (3.0 TB)     Free Space:   16777216 B (16.8 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume YYYYYYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYYYYYYYYYY     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk3s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     3000144142336 B (3.0 TB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family ZZZZZZZZ-ZZZZ-ZZZZ-ZZZZ-ZZZZZZZZZZZZ         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Locked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       Converting         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  -none-             Status:                Locked             Size (Total):          2999808593920 B (3.0 TB)             Conversion Progress:   -none- /code/pre  I also tried codediskutil repairVolume disk3s2/code and it completed, but didn't help. Also, codediskutil cs revert .../code gives the following error:  precodeError: -69854: A disk with a mount point is required /code/pre  What should I do here? I do have an offsite backup, but if I can get it working it'll save me a substantial amount of downtime.  <answer163258> If this happens to you... your disk is probably hosed. Find your backups.  (I'm still interested if someone does have a solution, but given the lack of answers I don't think it's likely.)
