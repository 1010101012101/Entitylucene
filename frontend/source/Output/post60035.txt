Sounds are not working on Mountain Lion Notification Center <body> Although I see an option in System Preferences  Notifications to enable applications to pop a sound on new notifications, Mountain Lion is not actually playing those sounds.  Has Anyone run into similar problem?  <answer60323> I upgraded my mother's new iMac to Mountain Lion and noticed that the mail sending and receiving sounds were not occurring.  I found the following URL which was a temporary fix, but the problem comes back... so I think there's a bug here.

Have you tried for example adding a reminder at Reminders.app? <comment69316> Thanks for answering.  I've just tested the Reminder Notification: no sounds at all, even tough Notification Settings for Reminder app has all the three features enabled (notification, badge and sound).  Any other idea? <comment112379> Sorry my terrible einglish. I have same problem exactly. The sounds of some notifications of some programs of the center of notifications do not work (Capucin, Tweetbot), however others works o.k. (mail,mensajes). I think that many applications even aren'y ready to work with the center of notifications especially the sound the sound.
