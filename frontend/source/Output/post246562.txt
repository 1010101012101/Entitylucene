Resolving host...: Internet doesn't work (Chrome and Safari) <body> My MacBook sometimes can't connect to the internet. Chrome displays "Resolving host" but a web page doesn't appear. Safari also doesn't work. Interestingly, sometimes Google seems to work as the only web page (also auto complete in Google). After some time (or sometimes when I call "codedscacheutil -flushcache/code") it works for a few minutes and then the issue occurs again.   Other devices always work so it has to be related to my MacBook. I'm using two DNS servers from my ISP. When the issue is present Ping doesn't work (codeping: cannot resolve www.google.com: Unknown host/code) and Lookup doesn't work too (codewww.google.com -&gt; The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 2.)/code)  A few month ago I had the same issue. At the time I had to delete some files in the LaunchDeamons-folder but I can't remember which ones...  Anything I could try?  Update: If I add a second "Location" (in the Network preferences) I can simply switch to the other location and I'm back in the Internet... pretty tedious solution...  <comment304169> How about settings I described here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/245986/145449 the situation is different, but these would be first things to try. <comment304460> I just tried but after a few minutes the problem is back...
