My phone is stuck on the black screen with the apple in the middle, trying to restore it <body> Because my phone won't actually turn on and is stuck in the screen with the apple on it, it can't connect to iTunes where i need to go to restore it. Is there any way i can restore it without it connecting to iTunes?  <comment318036> Try to hard reset it by pressing Home button+Sleep (iPhone 6s and before) or Volume down+Sleep (iPhone 7) and see if it can turn on, otherwise put your phone into DFU mode and restore it.
