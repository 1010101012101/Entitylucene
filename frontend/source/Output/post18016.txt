Can I change the behavior of the Home and End keys on an Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad? <body> I just bought an "Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad", then I connected it to my Macbook Pro running Lion.  But the codehome/code and codeend/code key under the codeF14/code key doesn't work as I expected. Say in "Pages", the codehome/code key doesn't bring the cursor to the beginning of the line, while the codeend/code key takes you to the bottom of the page.    Does anyone know how to re-map the codehome/code/codeend/code key?  <answer18028> One option is to create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{   "\UF729"  = moveToBeginningOfLine:;   "\UF72B"  = moveToEndOfLine:;   "$\UF729" = moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:;   "$\UF72B" = moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:; } /code/pre  Quit and reopen applications to apply the changes. Note that codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code is not supported by some applications like Xcode or Firefox.  In Terminal you can assign home (↖) to control-a and end (↘) to control-e from Preferences  Settings  Keyboard. That will leave you with no key combinations to scroll to the top or bottom of a window though.  It might be easier to just use the default keybindings. In most native text views:  ul licontrol-A or option-up goes to the beginning of a paragraph/li licontrol-E or option-up goes to the end of a paragraph/li licommand-left goes to the beginning of a line/li licommand-right goes to the end of a line/li /ul  <answer82581> Another option is to enable the "Use PC Style Home/End" setting in Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5GJA9.png" alt=""  The setting is defined in Resources/include/checkbox/for_pc_users.xml.  You can also save a file like this as code~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;appdef&gt;     &lt;appname&gt;HOMEENDIGNORE&lt;/appname&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.microsoft.Word&lt;/equal&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.microsoft.Powerpoint&lt;/equal&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.microsoft.Excel&lt;/equal&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.vmware.fusion&lt;/equal&gt;     &lt;prefix&gt;com.vmware.proxyApp.&lt;/prefix&gt;   &lt;/appdef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;homeend&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;homeend&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;not&gt;HOMEENDIGNORE&lt;/not&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::HOME, ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::A, VK_CONTROL&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::END, ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::E, VK_CONTROL&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::HOME, VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::A, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::END, VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::E, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Then open the KeyRemap4MacBook application, press the ReloadXML button, and enable the setting. See https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/xml.html.en for more information.  <answer120343> I followed this blog post and it did the "home" and "end" key bindings as well as a few other userful adjustments.   <answer128669> I would suggest you the awesome keyremap4macbook, it's free amd despite the name it works on any mac (not necessarily macbooks) and here you can find the easiest way to change the default behaviour of home/end buttons to work like they should (IMO)  <comment20016> This works on most of my apps like Pages and Textmate. But, I couldn't get it working in Terminal <comment20022> Right. Terminal is another story, and you'll need to tell it how you want the Home and End keys to behave. You can do that in Terminal - Preferences - Keyboard. Set the Home key to send `control-a` and End key to send `control-e`. Those are the Emacs-style keybindings that the Terminal uses for line movement by default. It'll mimic the regular home/end movement you're after. <comment20304> Thanks again Michael. I'll try it out tonight when I get back to my laptop. <comment131406> +1 Thank you! This has literally bugged me for years! <comment293903> We like answers to be more than just a single line.
