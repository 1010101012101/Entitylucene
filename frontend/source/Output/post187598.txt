Get alerted whenever someone uses your Mac? <body> I have a dedicated Mac Mini in a colocation that I access via Remote Desktop. I trust the colocation provider, but I don't trust my password is secure enough. Without resorting to a more secure password, is there an app that alerts me via E-mail or Push Notification via OS X server whenever the mouse moves on the Mac?  <answer187604> I found an article on Macworld that suggested two apps: br Hidden br Undercover  Their pricing is quite different. Undercover charges $49 for unlimited use on 1 device, while Hidden charges $2.50/month for 3 devices. If you want a free option, I think Mackeeper's Anti-Theft feature is free, but I don't trust them.  strongUpdate/strong: I found a free app called Prey which looks much more legit than Mackeeper.  <comment221791> These tools aren't exactly what I'm looking for. I'm looking for an alert system that will alert me every time the mouse moves (once an hour max). <comment221793> @Ninja I don't remember if Cisco Meraki Systems Manager (free) allows this, but the programs I suggested can preform what you want them to do if you mark the device as "lost" <comment221794> You might get suggestions over at Software Recommendations (http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/) as well
