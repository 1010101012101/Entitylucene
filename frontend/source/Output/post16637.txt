Which is the most powerful fan less iMac that uses a CRT for the display? <body> I am planning to use it as jukebox but I just know that apple started selling fanless iMac from 350mhz model... When did they stop doing fanless imacs? 700 mhz?  I just care about crt models.  <answer16655> It's hard to beat a fanless iPod and a set of fanless speakers for the power of great sound. I'm in love with my iPod HiFi and a Belkin Bluetooth receiver for when I don't want connect my iPod through headphone or dock connector.  It won't satisfy your CRT interest, but I suppose no answer can be perfect... ;-)  <comment18176> There are also fanless iCubes up to 500MHz <comment18177> That's right but since I have  to build the greatest jukebox ever I need an iMac: superior sound quality :) <comment18178> What is the difference in the sound cards - also for best surely you should use an external USB-analog DAC <comment18186> I'm sorry for being unclear... I mean the best integrated sound system (imac had harman kardon and were fanless: really surprising quality) <comment18201> Wikipedia is a great place to see the CPU on these macs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Macintosh_models_grouped_by_CPU_type - what exactly is most powerful? Loudest speakers? CPU? GPU? hard drive? <comment18209> ... and yes, this is a snarky, but hopefully humorous non-answer. <comment21578> And it doesn't care at all about how good that babe'll look in my room U_U And has no heart for antiques :D <comment21580> I want a Banana Jr playing some vintage james brown or meters for nostalgia's sake, but the color G3 bubble iMac have the best sounding speakers that EVER shipped with a mac - even the 20th anniversary + sub woofer to my ears. <comment21689> I do - obviously - agree
