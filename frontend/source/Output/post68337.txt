Mouse tracking speed randomly resets? <body> For whatever reason, the tracking speed of my mouse resets to the midway mark every once in a while.  Running Mountain Lion (10.8.2), and I've got two mice connected: Magic Mouse, WoW Legendary Gaming Mouse, as well as the Magic Trackpad.  What causes this, and can I keep it from happening?  No additional specialty software is installed.
