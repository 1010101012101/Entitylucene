Is there a way to check the OS's kernel files for corrupted ones? <body> Say, by comparing hashes with a list of hashes calculated from a fresh install?  I feel like my OS is hacked (possibly by entering my pass where I shouldn't have) and haven't had any luck with virus scanners or watching system logs, network logs, activity monitor, ...  So I'm trying to find a better way to check for hacks. I run Yosemite 10.0.5.
