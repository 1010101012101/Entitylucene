Cannot delete iMessages <body> Ever since updating to new operating system I cannot delete iMessages from my iPad. I had an Ipad 2 and bought a new iPad Air 2 today, but I still have the same problem.   <answer179985> To delete one or more iMessages from a conversation, tap &amp; hold one message until the strongCopy | More/strong float appears, then tap More.br You can than add or remove checkmarks from individual messages in that conversation &amp; delete using the trash can, bottom left.  To delete an entire thread, from the overview drag the thread name to the left - a delete button will appear on the right.  <comment213587> You say 'Ever since updating to new operating system' - which operating system update are you referring to?
