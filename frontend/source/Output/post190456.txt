Can I watch the WWDC from the beginning when the event has not finished? <body> I want to watch the WWDC tomorrow however I will traveling home from college. This means that I will miss some of it and do not want to start watching it half way through. Is there a way how I can start watching the WWDC at the beginning when I start watching it tomorrow?  <answer190606> h2UPDATE: The stream is officially posted in a replayable state, just like any other online video, located here. It's also the latest entry in Apple's "Apple Keynotes" podcast, available for download on iTunes and iDevices here./h2  Since no one seems to have given the answer iProgram was hoping for, I might as well make this a proper answer in case other people have the same question.  Under the circumstances, live blogs can be a tolerable substitute for watching the stream. (Source: Experience when Apple events happened during school hours.) I personally recommend the ones at Macworld and iMore, but there are countless others that you can find online if you search for them.  Good luck, and enjoy the keynote, however you end up experiencing it!  <comment226121> Just in case you don't get an answer, I can tell you that under the circumstances, live blogs can be a tolerable substitute for watching the stream. (Source: Experience when Apple events happened during school hours.) I recommend the one at [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/article/2926563/live-blog-apples-wwdc-2015-keynote-starts-10am-june-8.html), but I'm sure there are countless others if you want to look for them yourself. <comment226123> @user24601 Thanks for that. Think I remembered that Mac Rumors also do that. If I cannot find a way how to play from the beginning reading the post will be a great way to catch up with the program so I don't miss much info. Thanks. Still looking for a streaming way though. :) . This is the issues with time zones. That is 5PM my time <comment226124> If you don't mind waiting till the keynote has finished Apple posts the whole thing almost right away... <comment226126> I know. The only issue is that leaves me very little time for the rest of the evening. That is why I want to play it from the beginning while it is still streaming. Thanks for that information anyway. <comment226330> I may do that for now. Would you also recommend Mac Rumours as well? <comment226332> I know MacRumors is a decent news site, but I can't speak from experience about their live blogs. You're welcome to try it! <comment226333> Also, I think I'll come back here in a few hours with an actual answer to your question. If there's a boring part of the keynote that I don't mind missing a few seconds of, I'll open a new tab and see if rewinding is possible. Check and see if I've updated this answer when you get home and are ready to start watching. <comment226363> Just realised. It is at 6PM. I thought it was at 5PM. Im there on time! I am still open for answers for myself and other peoples future reference. <comment226366> I just updated with an official answer. <comment226405> Thanks for that. Good job I was here for all of it! :) Blogs/posts for it are always good too since you can catch up quickly.
