How to have ctrl-left/ctrl-right move over words in Lion <body> Had a quick question about having emacs-like word skipping in my terminal. I had set this up pre-upgrade to Lion and had codectrl-left/code &amp; codectrl-right/code set to code\033b/code &amp; code\033f/code respectively.  Unfortunately post-upgrade codectrl-left/code &amp; codectrl-right/code don't seem to be working any more.  I have seen this solution which makes codealt-left/code &amp; codealt-right/code behave as above, but I was hoping to get codectrl-left/code &amp; codectrl-right/code working as before and I was wondering if folks here had any solutions.  PS: As an aside this behavior is not working correctly in my VNC client as well - which it did previously.  <answer66181> Turns out that Mission Control(in Lion) has the same key combination to codeMove left a space/code and codeMove right a space/code - which I particularly don't have use for. Disabling this in codeSettings -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts/code did the trick for me.  <answer66237> ⌃← and ⌃→ have moved a word left and right by default in Terminal since 10.7.   You can also change them in other applications by creating ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and saving this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:  precode{     "^\UF702" = moveWordLeft:;     "^\UF703" = moveWordRight:; } /code/pre  <comment78018> I don't have a 'Library' under '~' and no 'KeyBindings' under '/Library' <comment78022> ~/Library/ was hidden in 10.7, but you can open it from the go to folder sheet. There's no KeyBindings folder by default though.
