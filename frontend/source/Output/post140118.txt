iMac 21.5â€³ Wi-Fi Issues <body> My iMac constantly dropping its internet connection in the last couple of days. I'm connected to a 2.4GHZ Airport Express. Not a router issue, because my iPhone and iPad works just fine, no connectivity issues. Also not an iMac hardware issue, because i tried to connect to the iPhone's tethering network using WiFi, works just fine, without any issues. Here is a copy/paste from the network utility when i try to ping google, you can see that the network is dropping constantly:  http://pastebin.com/TL3UyQif  You can see that the ping time increases just before and after the connection lost. Driving me nuts.  I know theres multiple questions like this, but i seriously tried every solution from these question, but nothing helps:  ul liPinging in the background to keep the connection/li liTried deleting all network preferences, setup new network/li liDeleting wifi keychains/li liUpgrade &amp; Downgrade Airport Express firmware/li liChanged the channel number to 11/li liTried with closed iTunes/li liTried different browser/li liPRam reset/li liTried renaming the SSID/li liConnecting to 5GHZ network/li liNo torrent running in the background/li liTried with Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4)/li liChanged MTU to 1453/li liDisconnected both my iPad and iPhone from wifi, so only my iMac uses the network, no luck/li /ul  If i disable wifi and turn it back on, it will strongALWAYS/strong fix the issue for a couple of seconds/minutes, but if i don't do anything, usually it will fixes itself in a minute or two.   OSX 10.9.4 21.5-inch iMac, Mid 2011  Not sure if it helps, but a couple of more stuff: I used the Wireless Diagnostics to get the following stuff:  ul liwifi.log: http://pastebin.com/svNJhNNr/li liAvailable networks: http://cl.ly/image/3a1n1X3X023E/li liPerformance: http://cl.ly/image/0v3f0d3H1B1p/li /ul  Edit: Just updated to 10.10 (14A299l), same issue, even when it asked me for my iCloud login on the first startup, it won't accept it because the connection lost...  <comment165124> Feel free to give me any tips what else should i provide in the question to help diagnose this issue. <comment165154> you did a lot of work already! did you check this article http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4628
