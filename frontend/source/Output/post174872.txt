What are the map mount points and why are they out of disk capacity? <body> I ran codedf-h/code on a MacBook Air and got the following:  precodeFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1     112Gi   73Gi   39Gi    66% 19220714 10101012   66%   / devfs          183Ki  183Ki    0Bi   100%      632        0  100%   /dev map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0        0  100%   /net map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0        0  100%   /home /code/pre  What are codemap -hosts/code and codemap auto_home/code and why are they full?  <comment225764> did you ever get an answer to this?
