How can I use aliases in the Go to Folder dialog? <body> Can I somewhere define aliases that I can use in the Go to Folder dialog?  More specifically, can I somehow setup Finder such that when I type codePictures/code it goes to the code~/Pictures/code directory?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nivfs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer114214> There's no nice way to set up an alias in the Finder like you can in the Terminal, but you can set up text-expansion abbreviations in the Keyboard System Prefs' Text tab.  I prefer Typinator myself, as it is much more flexible and full-featured than the system prefs.  You could also roll-your-own utility using a script-runner utility and Applescript.  <comment133872> How about cmd+shift+H, followed by 'pic', followed by cmd+o or cmd+down arrow?  That for me takes just as much time if not less than cmd+shift+G, 'Pictures', return. <comment133878> The `Pictures` folder is one example. I was hoping for a way to enhance the Go To functionality such that I could reach deeper folders easily as well.
