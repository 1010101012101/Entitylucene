Changing keyboard command for retrieving mouse cursor coordinates <body> From what I've understood, kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbd4/kbd is the way one currently gets Mouse Cursor Coordinates in macOS.   I use this combination for something else. Is there a way to change the keyboard command for retrieving the Mouse Cursor Coordinates? I tried looking in emSettings  Keyboard  Shortcuts/em, but didn't find anything.  Perhaps then, the keyboard command could be edited with something like Karabiner?  If the keyboard shortcut is not editable, is there a good and simple stand-alone tool for retrieving coordinates?   <answer293572> That key combination is for producing a picture from a section of the screen selected by the mouse and so that key combination is already fixed. It just conveniently shows the co-ordinates when selecting.  Unless it is possible to edit in the kernel or somewhere...  <comment370424> The implication is in that case that one simply changes the keyboard shortcut for screenshotting a part of the screen, which is available at *Settings  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Screen shots*. <comment370425> It may be editable there - however I use that shortcut for what it is set to already so don't want to edit mine...
