Performing simple management tasks on MacMini without display <body> I have an old MacMini whose former Thunderbird display is no longer available. Can I perform simple management tasks (such as wiping the disk clean) without an external display?   In terms of other equipment, I have e.g. a MacBook Pro, an iPhone, WLAN, and Ethernet cabling readily available. Can I use it to connect to the display-less MacMini?  <comment306046> I'd poke around with Google for "headless mac mini". However, without LOM support (like the Xserve), you'll be hard pressed to perform any low level functions such as wiping the disk.
