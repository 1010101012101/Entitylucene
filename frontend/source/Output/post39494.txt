OSX memory inconsistency (shared + private) <body> In the picture below the shouldn't the (shared memory + private memory) equal the real memory? Am I reading this wrong? What else constitutes the real memory size? I assumed that shared memory was real memory and private memory was real memory.  Thanks in advance :-)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VRqID.png" alt="memory image"  <answer39622> The accepted answer to this question (and the associated links) defines the terms and also offers some explanation which may help.  <comment44765> I appreciate the answer, I still couldn't find whether are not real is shared + private or some variant of that.  But that did help :-) I understand it is roughly that, but I was looking for something definitive. +1 though for finding that :-)
