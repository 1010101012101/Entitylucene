iPhone 5S battery percentage incorrect after replacement <body> I've recently replaced the battery on my iPhone 5S (running latest iOS 10.2.1) and the battery percentage has been wrong ever since.  It originally showed around 50% (which I believe is what the original battery was at when I did the replacement), I then discharged the phone (which turned off with the battery still at 50%), then let it charge fully to 100% (when it came back up it showed 50% instead of the expected 1% or so).  I then let it drain again and it shut down at 90% (though battery life was great as it lasted several hours of full brightness + graphics intensive gaming), when it came back up it showed 90% again instead of around 1%. I let it charge fully.  Finally today I once again used the phone (expecting the battery meter to be calibrated) and despite great battery life the lowest the meter ever showed was 90% and it shut down. It's now on charge and came back up at around 90%.  One odd thing I noticed is that when it dies it shows the low battery screen when plugged in but only for a very short time before going straight to the Apple logo, where I would expect it to stick around on the charging screen for a few minutes at least.  I haven't restored it since the battery swap, I am not sure whether I should do that (I'd like to avoid it as it doesn't remember any of the e-mail nor wireless passwords and it's a pain to set them up again).  Regards.  <answer276679> It's hard to know exactly what's going on, but I'd check this app to make sure it reports good health: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battery-life-check-devices-runtimes/id1080930585?mt=8. If everything is good there, then I'd perform a hard reset, which you can do by holding the power and home buttons until the phone restarts and shows the Apple logo.  <answer276688> iPhone 5 has terrible battery life. Especially when you stream movies/tv or if you game alot. Unfortunately the battery has a memory. Meaning, if you were to charge it at say quarter to half life at a normal rate. It will eventually die in that said, percentage.   I understand that it's a replacement battery. I'm assuming you got it from Apple. I suggest you give Apple a call. They would have the best answers to your questions.   Speaking of replacement batteries.  There is a process before replacing the battery.   ol liBack up your data to iTunes or iCloud /li liTurn off "Find my iPhone"/li liErase all contents and data/li /ol  There are also many tips that will help decrease the battery usage in your settings. For example:  Push mail, Opting out for sending diagnostic data, Safari - settings, Gps, Etc  Hope I helped you out some.  As I stated before, best to call Apple.   <answer281150> After replacing the battery with another one (form iFixit), the battery meter is back to normal. I didn't think this would ever happen but I was so happy today seeing the battery level in the red instead of it being locked at 100%.  <comment348278> The battery meter won’t be calibrated in one cycle, it’ll take a couple at least. <comment348313> I Just wanted to add that iPhones use Lithium-ion batteries and these do not suffer from a “memory effect” the way NiCd batteries do. <comment348361> I have had 2 iPhone 5s' the one dies at 32%, the other at 68%. The lithium-ion batteries hold on a lot longer then previous batteries, I agree. Although in the long run, it still depends on what you use the iPhone for. Gaming, streaming and using the hotspot are the major battery killers. <comment353381> A restore didn't change anything, however connecting the original battery brought back the battery meter, so I just purchased a crap battery off a scammer (steer clear from iPhoneFixUK). Had to file a chargeback and buy another battery off iFixit, we'll see how good it is when it arrives.
