Press kbdCMD/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdR/kbd at startup.   If you see a globe at startup than your are in internet Recovery. This will need some time because the specific system for your Mac will download from Apple.   Open Disk Utility choose the system drive on the left side (the drive named as "Macintosh HD" not the root drive), and click erase. Give the drive a name such as "Macintosh HD" for example.  If this operation done without errors, close disk utility and try to restore your drive from Time Machine.  <answer259306> Finally I solve it :  ul liEnter recovery mode/li liSelect Reinstall new macOS, it start downloading an old onebr (Mavericks)./li liit will start installing the OS./li liafter it finished it will restart and it will come the setup steps./li liNow the mac is working , restart and enter the recovery mode again/li libut this time to restore backup from TM which is what I want.  strongNow it will restore without any errors ./strong/li /ul  What I did notice is after executing the codediskutil list/code command again , I saw a new partition on the root hard drive which is codeApple_Boot Recovery HD/code I think this is the problem it was missing, also it explain why when I press Command+R it takes me to internet recovery mode not the normal one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5MhXT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment324386> Thank you but you are repeating what I already did exactly and still having the error when I try to restore from TM <comment324387> The Recovery Mode is different from Internet Recovery,  I didn't read anything above that you have reboot into Internet Recovery - Sorry if you have do it and the problem exists please leave a comment here. <comment324388> Actually I cant enter the recovery mode , when I press and hold Command+R without pressing option key , it show the global and start downloading and it takes me to internet recovery , anyway I did exactly what you're saying and I got no errors during erasing also I did repair and verify the disk and the desk is ok , but still getting the error when I try to restore from TM backup <comment324394> Are you able to make a clean install - if so, do it first, upgrade your system at the current system that you've before and try to restore TM. <comment324420> Glad to hear it great fun! <comment324421> @dante12 thanks for your help
