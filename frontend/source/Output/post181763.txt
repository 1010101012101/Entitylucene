Access Windows 7 files from OS X Yosemite <body> I've got PC with Windows 7 Pro and Macbook Pro with 10.10.3. They're on the same network, which is made by Netgear WNR3500L with default firmware. PC is connected by cable, and Mac through wi-fi.  PC got 3 HD, 2 of which i want to share with Mac. I used this topic (with comments) as a main information source, and also googled a lot.  The problem is that sharing not working. Basically, there's two cases:  ol liWith "password protected sharing" turned on, Mac just can't login to W7./li liWith "password protected sharing" turned off, Mac can see W7 shares list and also can mount W7 "public" folder. But when i'm trying to mount one of the shares that i shared manually, it's just shows an error, saying that i don't have permission to this server./li /ol  Here's some conditions and what i've tried to do:  ul liW7 firewall is turned off./li liSame workgroups on Mac and W7./li liW7 guest user is enabled./li liThere's special user in W7 with admin rights and password protection, which credentials i used to try login to W7./li liHDs is shared for "all" with full permissions (also tried to share exactly for special user)./li liLooking here and here tried "Send LM &amp; NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated" and "Send NTLMv2 response only" options in Local Security Policy (btw last one allowed me to see Mac shares from W7)./li liFile sharing (with SMB) is also turned on on Mac./li /ul  <comment216200> Under Windows, have you right-clicked the HDs and shared them using "Advanced Sharing"? <comment216201> @StuartH, yes, both HDs are shared for "All". <comment216202> Sorry, just noticed I skipped over that when reading your post. -.-' <comment216279> Solved, but only with "password protected sharing" turned off.
