Update Macbook to newest supported OSX version? <body> My Late 2008 Aluminium Macbook has 10.9.5 on it. The update tool offered me Sierra but then predictably told me I can't have it as this Mac is too old. I don't know what the last supported OSX version is for this Mac... is there a way I can get it?  In an ideal world I'd like to do a clean install as this MacBook is full of all kinds of crud I don't want anymore.  <answer284587> The latest OS supported on a Late 2008 Aluminum MacBook is OS X 10.11.6 and can be downloaded from this link which will open in the App Store.
