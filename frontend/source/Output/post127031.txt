Sync directories from iMac & MacBook . What is the recommended method? <body> I like to sync directories from my Imac &amp; MacBook . What is the recommended method?  <answer127045> There are many methods for syncing things across computers. If you do not mind having all of your directories within a certain superdirectory, and do not have too much stuff to sync, Dropbox is a great and incredibly easy way to go. If you have a lot of data or want to sync directories from anywhere on your computer, BitTorrent Sync is a quick and secure method for syncing data.  <comment148807> I'm looking rather for an in-house and not a cloud (e.g. dropbox) solution
