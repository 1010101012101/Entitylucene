Make folders opened by external apps open in a new finder tab rather than a window <body> I have the setting "open folders in new tabs" (instead of new windows) in finder turned on but this does not seem to influence what my other apps do when emthey/em open a folder. Launchbar and a shell script I run from emacs still opens folders in small finder windows. How can I make folders opened from external apps all appear in one tabbed finder window?  Edit: Bmike in the comment is right that this could probably be done via an applescript. Something like this:  ol liYou have some script that gives you the path of the folder you want to open. /li liYou pass this as a variable to an applescript./li liThis applescript saves the pathname as a variable/li liIt activates finder or opens a particular folder with finder./li liIt sends the keystroke command + t to open a new tab (or does the same with a command to finder)./li liIt sends the keystroke command + shift + g to finder opening the go to folder with path x menu/window./li liIt writes (systemevents) or pastes it (set clipboard to the variable that is the path of the folder) into this menu/window./li liClick enter. The folder is opened./li /ol  <answer128933> I did this, not sure if it will answer it for you.  Finder Preferences  General  check "open folders in tabs instead of new windows"  <answer266479> Thanks for the idea. I got the applescript finished.  Put the following in your code~/.bashrc/code or code~/.zshrc/code  precode# open the current folder in Finder's tab function oft() {     # if no arguments are given, we use the current folder     oft_absolute_path=$(cd ${1:-.}; pwd)      # execute the applescirpt     osascript 2&gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;EOF          # Finder returns a path with trailing slash         # But PWD doesn't have one, so we add one for it         set new_tab_path to "$oft_absolute_path" &amp; "/"          tell application "Finder"             activate              if not (exists window 1) then                 make new Finder window             end if              try                 set finder_path to POSIX path of (target of window 1 as alias)             on error                 # the finder's window doesn't contain any folders                 set target of front window to (new_tab_path as POSIX file)                 return             end try         end tell          if new_tab_path = finder_path then             # the finder's tab is already there             return         end if          # open new tab in Finder         tell application "System Events" to keystroke "t" using command down          # set the Finder's path         tell application "Finder"             set target of front window to (new_tab_path as POSIX file)         end tell          return     EOF     # clear the tempory veriable     unset oft_absolute_path } /code/pre  In terminal, type  precodeoft . /code/pre  to open the current folder in Finder's new tab.  The bash script is used for retrieving the absolute path, which I found difficult to do in appplescript.  strongemUPDATE/em/strong  I have made a more extensive (and complicated) version which will open the same tab for the same folder. Get it here  <comment131620> I want the same. <comment134548> I have the same problem, question on Super User: http://superuser.com/questions/688439/open-new-finder-tab-when-using-open-in-the-terminal <comment137201> It seems like this is is under the application's settings, not just Finder's. <comment144612> Can you share the shell script or launchbar details? It might be possible to embed an AppleScript call in them to tell finder to open a new tab. <comment144660> launchbar just opens stuff automatically, in shell scripts I use the open command https://developer.apple.com/librarY/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/open.1.html, to open via emacs in dired I use this script http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106131/make-folders-opened-by-external-apps-open-in-a-new-finder-tab-rather-than-a-wind?noredirect=1#comment144612_106131 <comment144663> I guess you're right that as long as you have the path you can open via an applescript, you need the folder path as a variable and could then do activate finder, cmd t, cmnd shift g, then paste/write the folder path in the go to folder command that appears, then then send return
