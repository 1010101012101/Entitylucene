Android vid clips to my mac <body> I have Android file transfer on my Mac, And pictures transferred ok, the videos i took with my phone didn't. So installed VLC media player, and tried to transfer some mp3 files to the Mac.  when i drag and drop to either iTunes or vlc, files are sent to some temporary files folder in the download, and i can't find them?   <comment165475> Did you get an error when transferring videos? <comment165476> Not a direct answer, but I generally use [DroidNAS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codesector.droidnas&hl=en) or [WiFi File Transfer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smarterdroid.wififiletransfer&hl=en) for transferring files from my Android phone to my mac wirelessly. In most cases, I have found these more convinient than a USB cable.
