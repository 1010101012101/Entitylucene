Command to find process and restart it <body> I have an issue with my Logitech Mouse software always crashing when it switches between different power modes, this crashes their software on Mac OS X (Yosemite).  The app is used to control the pointer speed and shortcut keys on the mouse, which renders the mouse useless,  I need to restart it every time I switch power states to get it working again.  Is there a command I can use in terminal that can kill the logitech process and start it again?  If I do a codeLogitech Gaming Software.app/code on codeps -ax/code I can find the process, how can I pipe this to kill the associated PID and then restart the app?  Running codeps -ax | grep 'Logitech Gaming Software.app/code will return the following:  precode 2879 ??         0:02.96 /Applications/Logitech/Logitech Gaming Software.app/Contents/MacOS/LCore  2891 ttys000    0:00.00 grep Logitech Gaming Software.app /code/pre  <answer210286> Here is what I'd try...  Create a bash script using the code below and save it as a plain text file without an extension.  Place it in a directory that in your $PATH, e.g. code/usr/local/bin/code and make it executable using: codechmod +x filename/code where emfilename/em is the name you gave the bash script.  precode#!/bin/bash kill $(pgrep LCore) sleep 1 open -a  "/Applications/Logitech/Logitech Gaming Software.app" /code/pre  Now in a Terminal type the name you gave to emfilename/em and press Enter...  The code$(pgrep LCore)/code portion of codekill $(pgrep LCore)/code should pass the appropriate codePID/code of code/Applications/Logitech/Logitech Gaming Software.app/Contents/MacOS/LCore/code to codekill/code and terminate its process, wait a second and then open the strongLogitech Gaming Software.app/strong application bundle.
