How to add user's mbox to Mail? <body> I have a couple of cronjobs running on my Mac. cron will send out mails and put them in my user's mbox, which I can read via the mail command. However, it would be nice to see them in the regular Mail.app. Is this possible? If so, how?  <comment288290> I mucked around with this a bit and because I ran into a road block that I couldn't figure out in the time I had to spend on this, it's why I'm posting a comment rather than an answer. It seems that under OS X `cron` ignores MAILTO environment variable in the crontab. Using info in [TinyURL](http://tinyurl.com/hc3edhh) and setting an alias in `/etc/aliases`, `cron` did attempt to email to my ext. email address however my ISP was returning it with "Sender address rejected: Access denied (in reply to MAIL FROM command)" and other info omitted for brevity. Maybe this info will help you get there.
