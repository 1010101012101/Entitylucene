How can I delete Image Capture's history of past "Scan To" folders? <body> I have used Apple's emImage Capture/em utility to scan to a few different folders on my local storage. As I use each folder, its name accumlates in the pop-up menu of "Scan To:" locations, as a sort of history.  I would like to clear out this history.  How can I do it?  For instance, is the list of recent folders in a plist file somewhere which I can edit or trash?  (What I really want, which is probably the subject of a different question, is to make narrower the Details pane on the right side of the emImage Capture/em window. It appears that the utility widens this pane enough to accommodate every name in the Scan To: popup window.)  I am using Mac OS X 10.11.6 emEl Capitan/em.  <answer280323> Here's a workaround that just succeeded for me.   ol liIn the emImage Capture/em utility, open the Scan To: pop-up menu, and remember each folder in the "history list" part. Not just the name of the folder, but its parent folder./li liQuit the emImage Capture/em utility./li liIn Finder, rename each of the folders from the "history list" part. You don't need to delete the folders, but you do need to be sure that nothing exists at the path where each of the folders was./li liRun the emImage Capture/em utility again. Open the Scan To: pop-up menu. The history part should be empty./li /ol  Worked for me, on Mac OS X 10.11.6 emEl Capitan/em.  <comment352605> A workaround is nice, but I would still appreciate a better way to clean out this history.
