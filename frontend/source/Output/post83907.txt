Does software exist to rename songs in iTunes based on audio matching like shazam? <body> I am looking for program which will automaticly rename songs and albums by comparing the actual acoustics and played /perceived?  Basically, use Shazam some way?  <answer84303> Equinux's Song Genie can do this, though it's not perfect.   <answer84305> I achieved good results with MusicBrainz Picard. This is a stand-alone program, but it can be used in combination with iTunes, too.  As in emShazam/em, audio fingerprints can be used for detection.  <answer84314> TuneUp worked best for me, though it's pretty pricey at 39.95 USD per year, or 49.95 USD one off:     Intelligently fix mislabeled song information (like “Track 01”), add missing album cover art, remove duplicate tracks, view lyrics to your favorite songs   TunesCleaner is also good:     With TunesCleaner, you can:      ul   liDownload the album artworks automatically/li   liDownload lyrics of songs automatically/li   liDelete the duplicated songs or songs which iTunes can not locate/li   liCreate playlists based on albums and artists/li   liRename selected genres in the batch mode/li   /ul   <comment96544> rename what to what - ie what rules would you be using? <comment96546> I found program TuneUp. But quality is realy low. <comment96547> What are you trying to do - I could write a script that renames all songs to aaaa but I suspect that is not what you want
