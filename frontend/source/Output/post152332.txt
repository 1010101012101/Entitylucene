What is the wheel user group for? <body> The output of codegroups/code after codesudo bash/code lists the following groups:  precodewheel daemon kmem sys tty operator procview procmod everyone staff certusers localaccounts admin com.apple.sharepoint.group.2 _appstore _lpadmin _lpoperator _developer com.apple.access_screensharing com.apple.access_ssh com.apple.sharepoint.group.1  /code/pre  What is the codewheel/code user group for and why is it called codewheel/code?  <answer152334> From Wikipedia:  Modern Unix systems use user groups to control access privileges. The wheel group is a special user group used on some Unix systems to control access to the su command, which allows a user to masquerade as another user (usually the super user).  In computing, the term wheel refers to a user account with a wheel bit, a system setting that provides additional special system privileges that empower a user to execute restricted commands that ordinary user accounts cannot access.The term is derived from the slang phrase big wheel, referring to a person with great power or influence.  <answer216753> Quoting from superuser:     Mac OS X has roots in BSD UNIX, a.k.a. the UNIX that came out of UC   Berkeley.  They had a group of trusted people   that could become superuser by using the codesu/code command.  So they coded   their UNIX to only allow people in this specific group to become   superuser using codesu/code.  They chose the groupname 'wheel', supposedly   reference to other systems that had WHEEL, possibly a reference to   being a 'big   wheel'      It's less important now that you have the GUI authorization popups and   sudo.  You can use sudo without being in wheel group I believe.   <comment179239> See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_%28Unix_term%29 and also: http://superuser.com/questions/191955/what-is-the-wheel-user-in-os-x <comment179241> thanks. I thought it would be useful to have the answer here too. <comment179247> This is mostly irrelevant on OS X, since most of the functions traditionally controlled by wheel membership have been replaced by things that use the admin group instead (e.g. `sudo` is generally used instead of `su`, and `sudo` is configured to allow members of admin to use it).
