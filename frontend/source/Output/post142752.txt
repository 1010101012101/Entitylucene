broke my python easy_install how to fix? <body> Any idea how to fix:  precode-bash: /usr/bin/easy_install: No such file or directory /code/pre  I kind of deleted it by accident before I realized that being behind a proxy was my issue not easy_install  <answer142767> codeeasy_install/code is part of setuptools. There's a handy script to bootstrap it:  precodecurl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python /code/pre  You may need to put codesudo/code before codepython/code if it throws a permissions error. There's a few more details here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions but that one-liner should do the trick in most cases.  <comment168179> You may know this, but many Python developers choose to leave the Mac OS X install of Python alone to avoid system issues. I currently install a separate copy via http://brew.sh <comment168184> restore from backup or reinstall the OS, easiest get the combo upgrade and see if that fixes it <comment168186> I agree, it can definitely be a pain to work with the system Python. My answer applies to both system-installed and external versions. It'll put setuptools in the site-packages directory of whatever python you use to run the setup script.
