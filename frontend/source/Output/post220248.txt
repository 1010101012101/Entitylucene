How to set Title in Contacts but not display it? <body> Is there a way to set the 'Title' field in Contacts, but to not display it?  i.e., in Mail I want to see "John Doe", but have the contact card display "Captain John Doe".  Can I do this?  <answer220249> Set it as a Nickname instead. Then it would only be seen by you.  Don't hand the contact card to anyone, though, as it would be in that.  See Does a Contacts Nickname transmit to anyone else; iMessage or email? for a cautionary tale ;-)  A friend of mine has been "Young Master Johnson" sup[fake name]/sup for 15 years without anyone else knowing.  <comment266566> That's not quite what I want.  I want to be able to see the Title, but only inside the Contacts.app. <comment266567> Anything you add to Contacts will be seen system-wide by any app that uses it, including iDevices. <comment266570> OK, thanks for your help!
