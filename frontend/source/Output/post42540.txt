Need better performance: best alternative for Lion's built in VNC server? <body> I'm connecting to my work's iMac through VNC. On the client side I use JollysFastVNC (on my Mac at home) and as server I use Lion's built in VNC server. The appearance is just great but the overall performance sucks. I would prefer less quality and gain a bit of performance instead. Unfortunately Lion's VNC server only allows high-quality connections. Only thing I can adjust is the color depth.  Is there a better free VNC server for Lion?  <answer42545> h1TeamViewer/h1  It doesn't use VNC, but it works very well. You can adjust the settings for better speed, quality, etc:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jxMpo.png" alt="enter image description here"  And you don't have to set up any port forwarding on your firewall, it all goes through the TeamViewer servers. I highly recommend it.  <answer238031> Try using R-HUB remote support servers. It is an on premise solution utilizing optimum bandwidth, hence better performance.  <comment48351> I use this to support clients spread all over the world. It works great. Would recommend it for better speed. <comment48475> Not an option. I need VNC :-(
