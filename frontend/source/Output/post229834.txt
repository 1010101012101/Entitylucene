View saved wifi password Iphone 4S <body> Im new to Iphone.  Love it except that I have forgotten the previous saved wifi password for my iphone 4s.  I needed to delete some apps to make room for more and my friend did a reset.  Now I have no password to re-download what I need.  She also did this to my daughters Alcatel Fierce One Touch phone.  So I'm effectively screwed. Im really not phone savvy and have no idea how to find the password I've had saved for a year.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.    <answer229836> There is no way to view a saved password on your iPhone.  However, if the password is a WPA security key, it should be on the internet router itself. The same goes for most other types of Wi-Fi password. Try finding the router and see if you have a line labeled codeWPA/code or codePasscode/code, or something along those lines.  <answer229846> There is no available applications and any tools to show the password of available Wifi networks that you already connected, if your iPhone is not jailbreak.
