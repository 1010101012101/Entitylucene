How to grep with filename highlighted in one color, and the match highlighted in another color? <body> On the Mac, I can't seem to use codegrep/code and have the filename highlighted (or in) a certain color, and have the matching string in a different color.  Is there an easy way?  <answer228335> This is already answered on stackoverflow:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17236005/grep-output-with-multiple-colors  but it only works if you can match the filenames using a pattern or several patterns.  <answer270485> OS X grep is too outdated: it does not support this.  You need to install a newer version, for example from HomeBrew  precodebrew install homebrew/dupes/grep /code/pre  By default, the newly installed grep is called codeggrep/code. You can change this behavior by adding the option code--with-default-names/code.

The answer I linked to is all the information you'd need, but if you want a copy and paste solution I'm not sure how I feel about doing that leg work without any form of compensation <comment339929> It's not perfect, but I used an example I found elsewhere and modified it so that awk makes what it thinks is the second field of date's output red:      date | awk -F: '{ print $1 " \033[1;31m:" $2 "\033[0m" $3 } '
