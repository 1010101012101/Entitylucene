Dates format in Message's chat.db <body> I'm working on improving my iMessages backup-script. code/Users/Kyro/Library/Messages/chat.db/code has a table codemessage/code with all the messages an some dates.   Any idea what's the date format ? I first thought of a timestamp (I have for example code408978598/code) but codedate -r 408978598/code return a date in 1982.  <answer114170> well using coreUtils date :   I found what I was looking for :   precode$gdate -ud "2001-01-01 + 408978598 seconds"  Tue Dec 17 13:09:58 UTC 2013 /code/pre  It's a timestamp with base date January 1st, 2001.   <answer205688> To add on to @Matthieu's helpful answer, here's how to convert it within SQLLite:  precodedatetime(date + strftime('%s','2001-01-01'), 'unixepoch') /code/pre  For example:  precodeselect   is_from_me,   datetime(date + strftime('%s','2001-01-01'), 'unixepoch') as date_utc,   text from message; /code/pre  <answer239030> In the script you are referring to, you can achieve timestamping like so: datetime(date + strftime('%s', '2001-01-01 00:00:00'), 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as date from message--to get in in local time if that's what you are looking for.   <comment248051> To see it in your default local timezone, omit the `-u` option and add the UTC timezone indicator to the date string:  `$ gdate -d "2001-01-01Z + 408978598 seconds"`
