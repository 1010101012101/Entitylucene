Is 8gb of RAM in one memory slot possible for a mid-2009 2.53GHz MacBookPro5,4? <body> I have a mid-2009 2.53GHz MacBookPro5,4 and recently bank 1 stopped recognizing any ram installed in the slot (similar to this issue https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4263981).  I originally thought it was a bad module and tried different 2x4GB paired ram kits but same issue. Only one bank seems to work now. I really need at least 8gb or ram for work and I'm not quite ready to shell out for a new laptop. So I'm wondering if I can salvage this machine by putting a single 8gb module on the one bank that still works.   Has anyone tried this?
