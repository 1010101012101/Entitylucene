How do I remove a dmg from a bootable USB flash drive? <body> I created a bootable flash drive using the instructions on Ubuntu's website using OS X 10.6, but it was for the wrong version of Ubuntu. Now, I want to remove the dmg from the flash drive, but diskutil isn't letting me remove it.  <answer23531> Open the USB drive in Finder and delete the contents that way. Then empty the Trash before ejecting the USB drive.  <comment26374> WHen you say diskutil isn't letting you remove it; what are you trying to do exactly? PS You managed to make a bootable usb from a mac?! I tried it earlier this week and it didn't work..not even from cd lol
