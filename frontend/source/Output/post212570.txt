.iso vs .img files for DVD images? <body> There seem to be multiple standards for image files representing the contents of a DVD.  For example, iDVD creates code.img/code files if told to burn a file rather than a DVD directly.  However, Linux install disks (for example) that are too big to fit on one CD (over 740 Mb or so) usually come in the form of code.iso/code files meant to be converted to a physical DVD using codedd/code, Toast, Disk Utility, or a comparable program.  Disk Utility can also mount an code.iso/code image on the desktop so that it looks like a drive, much as with code.dmg/code files.  So, several related questions:  ul liWhat exactly differentiates a DVD-size code.iso/code from a DVD code.img/code?/li liIs there a simple conversion path from code.img/code to code.iso/code?/li liIs code.img/code an Apple-specific file format?/li liIf code.img/code is Apple-specific, should I be worried about archiving DVD images that I want to keep permanently as code.img/codes (i.e., is it possible that future software won't be able to read them)?/li /ul  The last question speaks to the specific issue that brought this question to mind--I have a number of DVDs of home movies, painstakingly produced with iMovie and iDVD, that I would like to archive both as actual burnt video DVDs (i.e. for a DVD player) and as image files from which I can burn more copies if necessary.  But is code.img/code the best format to do this, or are those likely to become obsolete?  Would code.iso/code be better?  I'm interested in the general question of code.iso/code vs code.img/code (vs any other relevant formats) too, as the title of the question indicates.  <answer212571> strongSingle-track (code.iso/code) vs. multiple-track (code.img/code)/strong     Any single-track CD-ROM, DVD or Blu-ray disc can be archived in ISO   format as a true digital copy of the original.      But ISO files have limitations. For example, a CD can have multiple   tracks, which can contain computer data, audio, or video. File systems   such as ISO 9660 are stored inside one of these tracks. Since ISO   images are expected to contain a binary copy of the file system and   its contents, there is no concept of a "track" inside an ISO image,   since a track is a container for the contents of an ISO image. This   means that CDs with multiple tracks can't be stored inside a single   ISO image; at most, an ISO image will contain the data inside one of   those multiple tracks, and only if it is stored inside a standard file   system.      Formats such as CUE/BIN, CCD/IMG and MDS/MDF formats can be used to   store multi-track disc images, including CD-Audio discs. These formats   store a raw disc image of the complete disc, including information   from all tracks, along with a companion file describing the multiple   tracks and the characteristics of each of those tracks. This would   allow an optical media burning tool to have all the information   required to correctly burn the image on a new disc.   emShamelessly copied (an slightly edited) from wiki/ISO_image (24-10-2015)./em  <comment256657> Nice question. On my Mac I can just replace `.iso` with `.img` and vise versa. <comment257411> Interesting.  Good find.  This seems to disagree with your comment above, though.  If an `.img` is a metaformat of sorts that can contain `.iso`s and "a companion file describing the multiple tracks..." then how can you just change the extension on an `.img` and make a valid `.iso` out of it?  I would think that the metadata would come across as noise. <comment257412> Because I only encountered single track IMG files so far;) <comment257414> Aha, ok, so perhaps all valid `.iso`s are valid `.img`s (just single-track `.img`s) but not vice versa. <comment257416> That is correct
