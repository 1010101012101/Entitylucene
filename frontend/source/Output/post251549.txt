OSX Internet Recovery Issue <body> I have a mid-2010 MacBook Pro (C2D version) that the battery swelled up in and the HDD was destroyed.  I removed the battery and HDD and put a SSD in and I'm trying to do an internet recovery.  I hold down kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd and connect to a WiFi network and I get the globe. Then once the globe exits it goes to the Apple Logo screen and the loading bar at the bottom gets stuck about 75% done.  Anyone have any ideas on this?  I'm using an SSD that came from my desktop and is formatted in NTFS (I was going to reformat once I got into the disk utilities screen).  The sleep light does flash 5 times (processor not usable????) not sure what that means. The laptop was slow when I was recovering data off of it, but it worked.  All that I've done since is replaced the HDD with an SSD.  <comment313767> It is possible there is more damage beyond the HDD and battery, try checking the motherboard. Also try internet recovery with no SSD attached.
