Bad performance MacBook Pro Retina <body> So I bought a strongRetina MacBook Pro 13" 8GB RAM, 2,6GHz (Mid - 2014)/strong it's the brand new version with upgraded specs and I upgraded from my MacBook Air 13" (Mid - 2013) which handled OS X Mavericks like a boss.  So when I first launched it, it had strongOS X 10.9.4 pre-installed/strong and I noticed the perfomance was so bad. I even let it optimize. My MacBook Air handled Mavericks better than this one, which you would not expect considering my Pro is more powerful.  Everything is lagging, from Notification Center to Launchpad. Entering Mission Control, switiching desktops, entering full screen and so on.  And it's not little lag, it's annoying much. Too much considering my Pro is stronger than my Air and my Air has not this issue.  strongActivity Monitor says this:/strong  strongPhysical Memory: 8GB  Memory used: 7,97GB  Swap used: 30MB/strong  strongThere are no new updates/strong for it either considering 10.9.5 is still under development.  strongDid my Mac come with a bad install of Mavericks?/strong If so, should I restore? I have nothing important on it as of now since I'm considering to re-install.  I have also tried to change the screen layout and nothing works. Not even the one who says is best for Retina.  strongIs it Mavericks that has poor optimization with Retina Macs? Is it my software? or is it my Mac?/strong  strongAlso wondering if anyone else has this issue./strong  strongEdit:/strong Sorry, forgot to mention what I meant with bad performance. Have added what is lagging.  Memory tab: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h4Xx5.png" alt="Here is all the Memory usage.

You are a tinkerer and sometimes little changes that seem meaningless can create problems.  However, if your MBP has a traditional disk rather than an SSD, I think it’s likely that you are seeing normal performance. As icondaemon mentioned, the step-down in performance in going from an SSD to a spinning disk is far more noticable than any step-up in CPU for all the activities you mentioned.   I can’t imagine anybody can go from a spinning disk to an SSD and not think that there’s something wrong with the new system.  Fortunately, it’s relatively cheap and easy to replace the existing disk in a MBP with an SSD. The hardest part is making sure you have the correct screwdrivers so you don’t strip any screws when doing it. The performance differece is night and day. The MacBook Air has a PCIe SSD so will still be somewhat faster but it will be close enough that you might not even notice. My current recommendation would be a Crucial MX100 512GB SSD based on a 2012 MBP SSD upgrade that I just did.  <comment166585> How are you quantifying "...performance was so bad"? Is anything eating up CPU cycles or memory? Check Activity Monitor or the `top` utility in Terminal for processes that are consuming massive amounts of resources. <comment166586> Sorry, I added what I mean with bad performance. <comment166587> Um ... what constitutes 'bad performance'? What objective measurements can you give us that will help us help you? Remember, a MBAir has a solid-state HD, which means app loading, file saving, etc, is much, much faster than a non-SSD HD. The mid-2014 13" Macbook Pro does not have a SSD or Fusion Drive (mix of SSD and spinning-disk HD) option. Perhaps the bad performance is related to this. Please edit your answer to give us the specs on you MBP. <comment166589> Already have, check the middle part. <comment166590> Okay so I checked with Activity Monitor and it says for the RAM:  Physical Memory: 8GB Memory used: 7,97GB Swap used: 30MB <comment166591> @Atopsy well there you have it: you're using up all your RAM! Are there any programs that are using a large amount of RAM? <comment166592> Mavericks intentionally tries to use all of your RAM to cache recently used applications and files. What does it say for the breakdown of memory usage? eg. App Memory, File Cache, Wired Memory, Compressed? How high is the Memory Pressure graph? A screenshot of both the Memory tab (sorted by Memory column) and the CPU tab (sorted by CPU usage) would be nice... <comment166593> @Chris Mukherjee. There are 4 things that uses most of the RAM. That is Kernal_Task, Safari, iTunes & Window Server.   There are nothing in there that takes alot of RAM. But i don't know if thats normal for iTunes & Safari to take up so much. And I have no idea what Kernal_Task is.  They all range from 200MB to 400MB <comment166594> @Atopsy please post a screenshot of your Memory tab and CPU tab for us. Just telling us memory/swap usage is not very helpful :) <comment166597> Screenshots up. <comment166598> I can't see how my apps can eat up 8 gigs of RAM.   Something is either hidden and eating it all up or my Mavericks version is a bad install.  Can I fix this with a restore? Because if it does, I will do it. <comment166601> Are you sure you're running Mavericks? You have the red iTunes logo and the new Finder logo as well. My Activity Monitor also does not use the same font as you. Can you click the Apple logo in the top left and select "About this Mac" and let me know if you are actually running 10.9 or 10.10? **Edit: I see your comment about LiteIcon now...** <comment166606> "I have changed my App icons using LiteIcon to make it look like Yosemite" Did you change the system font too? Looks a lot like Helvetica Neue to me... <comment166607> @Patience that is why I'm suspicious, as well. It isn't the default font. <comment166618> @aglasser I Used TinkerTool to change the system font. <comment166619> Cool. If nothing is hogging resources, then I have nothing else to go off of to help you. Sorry. You might have better luck at an Apple Store. <comment166620> @aglasser Yeah I have already contacted them. They want me to bring it over to the Genius bar next week. <comment166638> Yes but I fixed this issue using Memory Clean, the application for Mavericks. It cleaned up a lot of Ram and already I'm seeing huge improvements in performance. <comment166641> @Atopsy do not edit your questions to replace them with answers. But please feel free to add an answer that details what you did to solve the problem!
