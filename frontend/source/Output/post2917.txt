Good Newsgroup Client for OS X <body> I've just switched to OS X and am struggling to find a good, easy to use, and preferably free/cheap newsgroup reader. Does anyone have any good suggestions?  <answer2918> Unison by Panic is quite good. It's fully featured and looks nice but the UI is a bit wonky at times.  https://panic.com/unison/  <answer2919> "Cheap" is a relative and subjective term, but if you want good, then I highly recommend Unison by Panic Software.  <answer2924> Unison is very nice but not free. An alternative is OSXnews. May not be as polished as Unison, but it works and it is open source.  <answer27740> I actually made very good experiences with a multi-functional piece of software called "SeaMonkey". It comes from the Mozilla corner, so it's for free! You can set it up (somewhere in the settings) to only act as a newsgroup reader, which works well.  <answer29078> I use NetNewsWire. It is free and there is a paid version. It syncs with google groups as well.  <answer71983> I use MacSoup on Lion. It appears dated and some functions like filtering are not as easy to use as they could be, also it can only deal with one newsserver. However it has a very good way of displaying and managing threads which outways its limitations  <comment33473> A RSS reader isn't a Usenet/newsgroup reader. <comment221551> Update: Unison is now free, as they've decided to stop developing it. http://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/
