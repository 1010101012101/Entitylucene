How do I make the hard drive visible in the Finder? <body> On OS X Lion I don't see the hard drive in the Finder and I seem to have no permission to create a folder under / from terminal.  I know I can do this if I activate the root user, but I need to be able to see the directories I have created under / in the Finder.

This is effectively like ‘My Computer’ in Windows. It will give you a list of all the connected drives on your Mac, both internally and externally connected drives as well as Network drives.  <answer242027> ol liWhile in the Finder, go to the "Finder" menu and select "Preferences"./li liAdd the name of your MacBook to the Sidebar./li liClick on the name of your MacBook and drag your hard drive or codeuntitled/code to the Sidebar./li /ol  <comment84592> Are you asking about Lion or Mountain Lion?
