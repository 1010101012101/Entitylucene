Yosemite Change two destops at once <body> I'm using two screens on Yosemite 10.10.4. When I change desktops, I have to change manually for first screen and then again for the second.  Is there any way to change both screens at once? Or make "one desktop" for both screens?   <answer198516> If I understand your question correctly, it seems you wish to  to change the behavior of the strongSpaces/strong feature in Yosemite do this:  ul liIn strongSystem Preferences/strong select strongMission Control/strong/li liUncheck strongDisplays have separate spaces/strong/li /ul  This will require a logout to affect the change.   <comment237543> Yes!
