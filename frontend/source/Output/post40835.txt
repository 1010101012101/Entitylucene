How to force coloured display of visited links in Safari 5+? <body> Relatively recently most browsers, including Safari disabled the colouring of visited hyperlinks for privacy concerns.  I do not give a damn about this type of privacy and I consider that this is a huge downgrade of accessibility.  Is there a way to re-enable this via a hidden setting or extension?  <answer40849> You could create a text file, name it visited.css, and put this text in there:  precodea:visited { color: #6611cc !important; } /code/pre  Then go to Preferences  Advanced, click Style sheet and select the .css file you just created. All links you've visited should be in a nice purple now.br (Note that this colors every link you've ever clicked purple, and will override the actual web design.)   <comment46265> Does this include Google Chrome? <comment48239> Thanks! I also tried to improve your solution and replace the colour with an opacity: 0.5 but for some reason it doesn't seem to have an effect. Still using colour works.
