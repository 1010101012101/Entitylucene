How can I tell when Finder is done searching? <body> I don't see any progress indicator, and the title of the window says:  precodeSearching "[Directory]" /code/pre  Is there supposed to be something that happens to let me know when the search is complete?  On some large directories (tens of thousands of files in hundreds of sub-directories) I know the search emisn't/em complete, because it hasn't found files that I know are there, and I usually give up before it finds them.  So on a directory with less files it is rather concerning to see no indication if the search is done yet or not, especially when nothing has been found that I emhope/em will be found, but am not sure if will.  <answer145521> Yes you can. Turn on the status bar: View  Show Status Bar.  There you can see whether the Mac is searching.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K5t29.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment171539> Thanks!  Looks like this is a new feature in Mavericks, it works on my 10.9 box, but not another box running 10.8.5.
