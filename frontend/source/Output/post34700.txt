Syncing folders/directories in Finder <body> I manually backup my home directory onto an external USB drive.  So far, I have to override everything data on each backup which, of course, results in long back up times.  Is there a free and simple tool that I can use to sync folders?  <answer34706> Unison or SuperDuper! are two apps that make doing sync-style updates easy.Time Machine automatically does sync-style updates, but also does versioning.   <answer34729> On 10.7 Finder now suggest merging folders when you copy and paste over an existing folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z025Z.png" alt=""  <comment39625> This is great! I should have seen this before. But because I this is always done in a hassle, I did not notice. Thank you.
