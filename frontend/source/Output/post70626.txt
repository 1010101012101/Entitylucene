ZEVO: anyone have access to a current road map? <body> I've recently installed ZEVO on my Mac Pro and I'm looking forward to what ZFS will provide with data integrity, pool management and drive handling.   emstrongWondering if there is a current road map?/em/strong  <comment81990> What does http://www.getgreenbytes.com/zevo say? <comment89438> Site says nothing different than the first time I read it before installing Zevo. <comment89441> Nevertheless you'll probably get a better answer by asking the Zevo team (or registering on the site and post the question in the forum). <comment89491> I have been active on the Zevo forums. Just like askdifferent, the forums are community-driven with little input from on High. The Zevo community is highly-focused on Zevo, I wondered what casting a wider net in a bigger pool might bring in.
