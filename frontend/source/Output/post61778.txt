Files in ISO DIsappear When Mounted <body> Some time ago I downloaded a QuickLook plugin that allowed me to look at the files in an ISO called Suspicious Package. I used this to inspect the contents of an ISO and it displayed this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GqMSi.png" alt="enter image description here"  And Finder says that the ISO is 428.1 MB. So the ISO definitely contains some files, but when I mount it by double-clicking on it, there's nothing in it; I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VsExs.png" alt="enter image description here"  I went into Disk Utility and clicked "Verify Disk" and I get this:     Verifying volume "PROSHOW DVD" br   Checking file system br   fsck_udf: Cannot read directory entry at offset 236: Undefined error: 0 br   fsck_udf: Directory Checking was bad! br   ** Checking Hierarchy br   ** Filesystem is dirty and non-repairable br   strongError: This disk needs to be repaired. Click Repair Disk./strong br   The "Repair Disk" button is grayed out though. My question is, how do I get at the files in the ISO?  <answer61779> ISO images typically contain more than one file system, the original ISO9660 file system for CD-ROMs (hence "ISO"), the "Joliet" extension to it for long filenames, and sometimes UDF or even a HFS+ file system. It's possible that one of them is corrupt, but the others are fine.  You could try explicitly mounting with the ISO9660 file system driver, as the UDF file system seems to be damaged. First, open a Terminal window. Attach the image without mounting:  precodehdiutil attach -nomount /path/to/image.iso /code/pre  This should output the name of the disk device node, e.g.:  precode/dev/disk2 /code/pre  Create a mountpoint for the filesystem, e.g.  precodemkdir /Volumes/rescue /code/pre  Then try mounting the device there, e.g.:  precodemount_cd9660 /dev/disk2 /Volumes/rescue /code/pre  If it worked, it won't output anything, but the disk should be visible in Finder. (You can "eject" it via Finder when you're done)  <comment71353> @qegal that was quick! Glad you got your files back :)
