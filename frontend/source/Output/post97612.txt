If you must have IE you need to run Windows virtually (e.g., with Bootcamp).  I would try the Chrome or Firefox (or Safari) on Mac and see if they can work for you.  In Safari, you can try this:  ol liGo to Safari  Preferences  Advanced  click on Show Develop Menu in Menu Bar./li liIn Develop menu  User Agent  Internet Explorer 9.0/li /ol  This might trick the websites into thinking that Safari is Internet Explorer.  <answer253920> Download Wine And Install The Windows Version Of IE  <comment114558> I'll also add: Internet Explorer used to be available in an old version for Macs, but it only ran under Power PC. Macs starting with Lion (I believe) stopped shipping with Power PC compatibility, meaning that once you have a Mac with Lion or higher installed you cannot run PPC apps like IE. <comment114565> In addition, Microsoft stopped any further work on IE for OSX in 2003, so any technology developed for web serving/browsing in the past decade probably wouldn't work. Buscar's workaround is your best option if you don't want to run actual or virtual Windows. <comment114567> The last Mac version of IE is version 5, and it is PowerPC only. The last OS capable of running it was 10.6 (PPC emulation via Rosetta). <comment316082> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.
