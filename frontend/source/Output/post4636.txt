Ipad navigation for South Africa <body> Is there an ipad app that will give me turn-by-turn instructions for south africa, or do I need to use an iphone app and the 2X button?  <answer4673> I'm not aware of any iPad specific apps for South African turn-by-turn navigation.  But, ALK Technologies, Ltd has iPad software for North America and Europe, and iPhone apps for South Africa - so I think your best bet would be to write to them or facebook them and ask when the South African version is coming out. If you're on safari and fleeing from lions and elephants I don't know if the iPhone version will be big enough to see clearly!   NB: Apple.StackExchange.Com takes no responsibility for Lion or Elephant related accidents.   <answer9481> NAVIGON MobileNavigator for South Africa is what you're looking for.br It's a universal app running both on the iPad and the iPhone/iPod touch.  <comment4554> Thank you, I think i will end up using the iPhone version on the iPad with the 2X mode enabled.
