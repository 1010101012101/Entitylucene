Sent text message keeps reappearing in the message box <body> I typed a short message to my son "I just booked a hotel" several days ago on my iPhone 7.  Every time I pull him up to text since then, that same message is in the typing field and I have to go in and erase it, then start typing my new message. I've restarted my phone twice, but the text is still there.  It is only happening with texts to my son - texts to other people are working correctly.  Any ideas?
