Why are Mac files able to have multiple owners? <body> Regarding Unix file permissions, which Macs use, why are Mac files in particular able to have multiple owners? For instance, you can view the "Get info" panel of a file, and under the Permissions section at the bottom, add another owner by clicking on the plus sign "+".  How does this work? I don't think vanilla Unix is able to do this?  <answer98303> You are right, vanilla Unix doesn't support this. But there is this thing called ACL (Access Control Lists) which allows for a much more granular definition of access rights than the usual user/group/world rights. From Wikipedia:     Most of the Unix and Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Linux, BSD, or Solaris) support POSIX.1e ACLs, based on an early POSIX draft that was abandoned. Many of them, for example AIX, FreeBSD, Mac OS X beginning with version 10.4 ("Tiger"), or Solaris with ZFS filesystem, support NFSv4 ACLs, which are part of the NFSv4 standard.   By default every file only has the user/group/world rights  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7MarG.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodepse@Fourecks:~/Downloads$ ls -le UML_Plakat_8_2012_Web-Download_V1.pdf  -rw-r--r--@ 1 pse  staff  4914537 Jun 21 09:56 UML_Plakat_8_2012_Web-Download_V1.pdf /code/pre  If you now add an additional owner  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/imxaL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Finder automatically creates a corresponding ACL entry for this:  precodepse@Fourecks:~/Downloads$ ls -le UML_Plakat_8_2012_Web-Download_V1.pdf  -rw-r--r--@ 1 pse  staff  4914537 Jun 21 09:56 UML_Plakat_8_2012_Web-Download_V1.pdf  0: user:jonnyenglish allow read,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity /code/pre  You can also modify ACL entries directly from Terminal by using codechmod/code (which gives you significantly more details to manipulate than the emGet Info/em dialog in Finder). For details it's probably best to run codeman chmod/code in Terminal and read the emACL MANIPULATION OPTIONS/em section.  <comment115389> Perfect, although I would just add that you will struggle to find a modern Unix implementation that doesn't support this, it is very much standard it's just that it's a ball ache to administer at a command line level, and most people never need to be aware of it. <comment115390> It's a pain to administer even with [GUIs](http://best-mac-tips.com/2013/05/12/app-change-acl-permissions-gui/) because you can shoot yourself in your foot quite fast.
