How to remove something I have downloaded via curl <body> I have followed this article: link and ran the following command:     curl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 5.6   How do I remove this, since I upgraded to Sierra and I already have php 5.6 version? If you include what happened when I executed this command, I'd be more than happy!  Edit for clarification:  ol liI googled how to update php that comes with osx./li liI opened this link I put above. And ran the command I mentioned./li liAnd it told me it created a folder code/usr/local/php5-5.6.27-20161101-100213/code and 'symlink'(?)./li liI updated to Sierra and the default php (that I was trying to "update") is now version 5.6./li /ol  I want to remove the php I installed from this article. I thought of deleting the folder I mentioned above, but I'm not sure that would do the thing. What about that symlink it made during the "installation"?  <answer261265> I wrote a shell script, codecrater/code (determine the impact crater of an install on a Unix filesystem) to deal with such poorly documented installation process:  https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/253217/31707  <comment327035> Which came first, the chicken (PHP 5.6) or the egg (Sierra with PHP 5.6)?  What exactly are you asking here? <comment327170> @Allan Sorry I thought I explained my situation well. I have updated my question and included the steps I took. <comment327181> What do you get when you type `which php`? <comment327226> You should run your _script_ through: [http://www.shellcheck.net/](http://www.shellcheck.net/)
