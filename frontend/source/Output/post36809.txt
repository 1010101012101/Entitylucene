Is there a Mac text editor that has live display of unique word count? <body> That is, it shows, while you type, the count of unique words. Not a count of all words.  If the document had the words:     The cat is in the hat which is in Toledo.   It would show a count of 7.  I know I could write a short shell script to do this but I'm looking for real-time display. If you know of an editor that allows writing such a real-time plugin that would be helpful as well.  <answer36810> Emacs can do it (as most things). Have a look at this page. The part: "How many times was each word used?" - is quite similar to your problem. WordCountMode shows how to put the info in the modeline. Shouldn't be too hard to get in a form you need.  <answer36812> Here is an online analyzer. Does it all in an instant! http://textalyser.net/  Dont forget to adjust the stoplist to "none" if you want to count every single word.  <answer36824> I can think of several possible solutions at all price points to help you tally up your words.  h2Free/h2  ul listrongText Wrangler,/strong by Barebones Software, is a free text editor that should be able to do what you ask and much more./li listrongWord Counter/strong isn't a text editor, but it can count your words, report word frequency, and provide readability statistics./li /ul  h2Low cost/h2  ul listrongiA Writer,/strong available on the App Store, shows running word and character counts and is unique in that it estimates how long it takes someone to read your work./li listrongByword,/strong also available on the App Store, is my personal favorite for writing in Markdown./li /ul  These two low-cost apps don't report unique words; however, they work great with strongMarked,/strong which can help you visualize word repetition.  h2Premium Software/h2  ul listrongBBEdit/strong, also by Barebones Software, is among the first text editors for Mac OS and highly regarded with deep support for AppleScript./li listrongTextMate/strong, by Macromates, is another text editor that can do much more than provide word counts/li listrongDEVONthink Pro/strong can do exactly what you want. Well, a unique word count is readily available and the app has a bonus; the capability of finding semantic connections among your documents using a pretty terrific artificial intelligence. strongDEVONnote/strong may also have this capability, but it's been years since I've used it./li /ul  emSorry I didn't link to all of my suggestions, but I don't have the clout here at StackExchange to post all of them. I left links to what I believe are the two best answers to help you./em  <answer169226> With BBEdit (not free) this can be accomplished with these steps:  ol liBreak up all words into individual lines by using several search and replace to turn any non-word character into a line break. To do that, use the Find command, turn on "Grep" checkbox, enter code[^a-z]+/code (this finds everything that's not a letter) into the Find box and code\r/code (that's a line break) into the Replace box, then click "Replace All"./li liRemove all empty lines by using the "Process Lines Containing..." command from the "Text" menu: Enter code^$/code into the text field and check only the "Use grep" and the "Delete matched lines" options. Click "Process"./li liRemove all duplicates by using the "Process Duplicate Lines..." command from the "Text" menu: Click "Leaving one" and check only the "Delete duplicate lines" option. Click "Process"./li /ol  What's left in the text is one unique word per line. So, check how many lines the text now contains to know the number of unique words in your text.  <comment118207> (The OP had a very specific request of count of *unique* words (So "The the cat the the" = 2). Not available in any of the usual editors AFAIK...) <comment198722> That sure doesn't seem very close to "live display of unique word count" as requested by the OP. <comment198732> In case you're going for a shell script approach, you could use TextMate's "Filter through commandâ€¦" menu item, using `tr -d "[:punct:]" | tr -d "[:digit:]" | tr " " "\n" | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]" | sort | uniq -u | wc -l` as a command and showing the result as a tooltip. This should give the desired result as a tooltip repeatedly by simply pressing the menu item shortcut and then enter. <comment198751> Right, it's far from being live. I had actually missed that part of the question. Yet, since I came here because of a similar question and saw that BBedit was mentioned as a possible solution, I thought of adding my hint nontheless. @TomGewecke would you know a better fitting question I could attach this answer to?
