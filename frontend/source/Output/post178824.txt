MacBook Pro doesn't recognize internal SSD <body> A week ago I inserted a USB cable into my MacBook Pro (late 2013) which resulted in the laptop immediately shutting down. After a lot of searching how to boot it up again I had to reset the SMC. After this it booted normally.  A few days later the MacBook Pro started hanging and freezing from time to time.   I decided to do a clean OSX install. After erasing the disk the SSD has never been detected again.

Any ideas?  <answer178889> It may be that your hard drive is no longer working properly and needs to be replaced.  However, you can try to diagnose using the Apple Diagnostics.  If hardware problems are indicated or Apple Diagnostics does not recognize your hard drive either, it may be worth looking for a Retail Store or AASP to get it looked at.  If you are still in Apple's hardware coverage, such repair will usually be free of charge.  <comment211974> It says: no issues found... Going to bring it to Apple, let them figure it out. Any idea how long it would take? I'm a dev so not good to have this taken away. <comment212146> It really depends on how busy they are, e.g. how many are already in queue.  Replacing a hard drive itself should not take more than 30-60 minutes once they start to open the computer and have the parts ready.  So, to get the most accurate information is to ask them really.
