Update a software that has been downloaded with an apple ID associated with a deleted email address <body> I am trying to update XCode. When I go on the AppStore and try to update XCode I receive the following message:  precodeYou have updates available for other accounts  Sign in to &lt;email.address@PastUniv.com&gt; to update applications for that account. /code/pre  email.address@PastUniv.com is an address email I had in my previous university and this email address has now been canceled!  How can I update XCode with the Apple ID I am using today?  <answer148244> As long as you don't have any user data stored within the xCode.app file structure, just delete the xCode app.  Then re-download it from the AppStore using your new AppleID.  <comment174686> Thanks for your answer. When I search for Xcode on AppStore I only have the opportunity to update and not to re-download it. Should I first uninstall my XCode to be able to re-download it? <comment174687> Yes.  Just make sure you saved your projects outside of the xCode.app folder.  By default they are saved to your user folder. <comment174690> Ok. And now I realize that the new version is not available on my OS version. Wel... I guess there's nothing further to do but buying the new OS version, right?
