Is it possible to launch and use Itunes with the command line on windows? <body> Is it possible to use iTunes with the command line on Windows?   I want to pass actions to the program like to play a playlist.   Is it possible to use any iTunes functionalities in the command line?   <answer266511> Use a program called CLMControl to send basic start/stop/pause/next track etc commands to itunes (or indeed any music playing app including VLC).  <comment168277> To launch it, you can just use `C:\Program Files\...\iTunes\iTunes.exe sound file path"`. I'm not sure about controlling it - you can from AppleScript, but I doubt you can from the Windows command prompt.
