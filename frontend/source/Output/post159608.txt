Firmware settings <body> I want to open the firmware settings. I have a Mac book Pro end 2011 and yosemite.  When i press Option+Cmd+O+F while booting nothing happens, it continues to boot.  What do i have to do?  Background:  i want to install ubuntu but i get black screen. Here is writen that you have to change something in the settings.  https://askubuntu.com/questions/162075/my-computer-boots-to-a-black-screen-what-options-do-i-have-to-fix-it  In section "3. Black screen" it is written:  The picture above actually only confirms DVD/USB booted using UEFI and there will be some means in firmware settings to ensure drives are booted in order to make UEFI installer run - the solution to which may possibly be as simple as ensuring SATA set to AHCI - check your vendors manual to check this. Also check UEFI Community Documentation Section 2.3 for more details.  <answer159610> Open Firmware's life in the Apple universe ended with the last PPC-Mac. Intel-Mac (as your MacBook Pro end 2011) use EFI.  Choose rEFIt (no longer maintained) or better rEFInd instead.  Please check this question and the answers at askubuntu.  <comment187556> i made an edit i need to change some settings <comment187558> @user3613886 i made some edits too
