Video broadcasting application for OS X <body> I need tips on a good application that you can stream "live" video and publish that on a website.  The source is raw video from a video mixer and i will have my os x machine in the middle and then out to one of my webservers.  <answer21536> Would UStream be what you are looking for?    Ustream is a free service (with a paid upgrade) for streaming from any platform to any platform. Users can view the video stream online or via a native app (iOS and Android). I highly recommend Ustream, as it works great and (best of all) is free. You can broadcast from the web interface: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/51GE5.png" alt="Ustream web broadcaster"  Or from Ustream Producer (free), which is a native app that runs on both OS X and Windows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CBxJS.jpg" alt="Ustream Producer"  Ustream Producer has many features including:  ul liScreencasting/li liSingle camera broadcasting/li liSave broadcast to watch later/li liImporting movies, stills and music/li /ul  There are two paid upgrades for Ustream Producer, Ustream Producer Pro ($199), or Ustream Producer Studio ($549).  Ustream Producer Pro includes all the features of the free Ustream Producer, but also adds:  ul liHD broadcasting/li liMultiple camera angles/li liHDV camera support/li liTitles, Layers, and Picture-in-pictures/li /ul  Ustream Producer Studio adds:  ul liChroma Keying (green or blue screen support)/li liAudio Sync Delay/li liIP camera support/li /ul  I highly recommend Ustream, as we use it for church and it works great!  <answer21554> Apple has a video broadcast solution here     .. With QuickTime Broadcaster, anyone can produce a live broadcast   event and anyone with an Internet connection can “virtually” attend.   The combination of QuickTime Broadcaster, QuickTime Streaming Server,   and QuickTime provides an end-to-end MPEG-4-based Internet   broadcasting system, allowing you to reach not only the large and   growing QuickTime Player base, but also any ISO-compliant MPEG-4   player.   <answer27229> VLC has a bunch of streaming options (and a lot of documentation on their website)  <answer36071> Try Flash Media Encoder.  I'm not sure what you're using on the website for streaming server, I've been using Red5, the OSS version of Flash Media Server, for browser side webcam video capture. It can also do live streaming and video conferencing but I haven't tried.  I would recommend QTSS but far more browsers have Flash installed then they do quicktime.  Video streaming isn't the easiest thing in the world to get right so I wish you good luck.  <comment24161> no ustream is something you need their website for. i need something for my own webserver. <comment31281> @norrfors You commented on the wrong answer. This answer doesn't reference UStream, daviesgeek's answer does.
