Storage Apps more than 800 GB on 256 GB SSD <body> My new Macbook pro 13 inch 256 GB (Early 2015)  Storage Apps more than 800 GB on 256 GB SSD  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Apam.png" alt="enter image description here"  with scan by DaisyDisk Apps 30 GB  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VfmaI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer191565> Although the issue I see normally is with "Backups" growing to ridiculous sizes, it's possible this issue is a variant of the same problem... Try typing codesudo tmutil disablelocal/code into the Terminal and enter your password, then turn Time Machine off and on,. If this is the same issue, in a minute or two the numbers should return to normal.  What this does is it disables local time machine backups, which are occasionally useful if you don't backup often, or if you don't have access to your backup drive for an extended period of time, and would like to restore a recently modified document. It often bugs out in various ways.  <comment227479> This is a duplicate.
