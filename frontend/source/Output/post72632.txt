How to jailbreak 2nd gen iPod Touch without losing data? <body> I have an 8GB iPod Touch 2nd Generation that runs iOS 4.2.1, and currently it is not jailbroken.  I want to jailbreak it using redsn0w version 0.9.6b4. I have found these instructions, but I will lose data if I follow them. I have backed my data up using iTunes. How can I jailbreak it without losing my data? Or can I restore the backed up data without removing the jailbreak?  <answer72633> You can do this using greenpois0n. Go to http://greenpois0n.com/downloads/ and follow the instructions. I have jailbroken my iPod and did not lose any data.  <answer93064> I've used redsn0w on iPod touch 2nd Gen. You will not lose any data.   <comment88331> Jailbreaking doesn't erase any of your data. <comment88355> @AndrewLarsson Thank you for the info.. <comment109186> My experience is the steps listed by abdullah kahraman are wrong. Don't use redsnOw. <comment109212> @MorganMcGahan If they were wrong, I would lose my data, which I didn't. Maybe you have done something wrong..
