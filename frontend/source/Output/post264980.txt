SB X-Fi Surround 5.1 + Internal Speakers = Best Solution? <body> I have a MacBook Pro (newest OS) and I tried both Soundflower &amp; AU Lab to make it work.  However, with AU Lab 5.1 system works fine but Internal Speakers do not (if I set up AU Lab "Audio Output Device" to the newly created "Multi-Output Device" (Built-In Output + SB X-Fi Surround 5.1)).  Is there any other way to connect all the channels together or maybe there is better software? Thanks.
