How do I change iMessage & FaceTime number on an iPad? <body> I bought a new iPhone and got a new iPad as part of the deal.  The problem is the AT&amp;T guy entered in the correct email address but the wrong number iPhone number into the iPad.  The iPad dings when there are messages, but the messages are not to me.  I tried to add my iPhone number, but the iPad reject the number with the following messages:  precode Cannot Verify Phone Number   This phone number is already being   used in your account   OK /code/pre  This seems like a real security issue.br How do I change the number on the iPad to the number of my iPhone?  <comment368168> After going to AT&T, they claim the error is with Apple.  Apparently, someone else's number is associated with my iCloud. AT&T checked, and yes, I'm only being charged for my iPhone's number and my iPad's number.  This strange number is not part of my AT&T account.  I now need to go to the Apple store to have them straighten out the this iCloud mishap.
