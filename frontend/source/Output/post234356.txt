How can I format a time to HHMM with AppleScript? <body> Is it possible to get the hour and minute in 24 hour HHMM format so that 1:01 would be 0101  I figured out a way to do it for the month and year but can't find a way for the hour and minute.  Here is what I have so far.  precodeset whichUrl to 0 set fileNames to "map" set theStartDate to the date "Tuesday, June 21, 2016 at 00:00:00" set theEndDate to theStartDate + (60 * 60 * 24 * 365) --1 year set theDate to theStartDate  repeat until theDate = theEndDate         set theURL to "http://site.com/map.php?iso="          set {year:y, month:m, day:d} to (theDate)         set theModDate to (y * 10000 + m * 100 + d) as string          set theURL to theURL &amp; theModDate &amp; hours of theDate         set theURL to theURL &amp; minutes of theDate          tell application "Safari"             activate             set the URL of document 1 to theURL as text             delay 2          end tell     set theDate to theDate + (600) --advance 10 minutes     set whichUrl to whichUrl + 1 end repeat /code/pre  <answer234386> Here's a script that takes the current time and makes it HHMM as you asked.  precode-- preserve the current text item delimiters so we can put them back set oldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters  set right_now to current date set the_time to time string of right_now -- something like "4:20:56 PM" set am_pm to characters -2 thru -1 of the_time as string -- is it AM or PM  set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ":" set the_hour to text item 1 of the_time as string -- in this example, "4" set the_minute to text item 2 of the_time as string -- in this example, "20"  if (am_pm is "PM") then     set the_hour to the_hour + 12 end if  if the_hour is "24" then     set the_hour to "12" end if -- that could have been more graceful but it's nice and obvious this way  if (count of the_hour) is 1 then -- padding with a zero if necessary     set the_hour to "0" &amp; the_hour end if  if (count of the_minute) is 1 then -- padding with a zero if necessary     set the_minute to "0" &amp; the_minute end if  set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "" set steves_string to the_hour &amp; the_minute as string -- putting the pieces together  set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelims -- cleaning up  return steves_string -- you would not need this line, but for testing it's nice /code/pre  I am sure that this could be tightened up but I thought it was educational to see it step by step.  You could certainly pass in any time you wanted-- does not have to be "current date." (Note that current date includes the time too. You peel off the "time" part of a date by asking for "the time string" of it.  <answer234551> precodeset whichUrl to 0 set theStartDate to the date "Tuesday, June 21, 2016 at 00:00:00" set theEndDate to theStartDate + (60 * 60 * 24 * 365) --365 normally set theDate to theStartDate  repeat until theDate ≥ theEndDate     if whichUrl ≥ 19997 and whichUrl ≤ 40000 then --In case I just want a range.         set theURL to "http://siteaddress?iso="          set theModDate to theDate          set theModDate to theModDate as date         set D to characters -2 through -1 of ("0" &amp; theModDate's day) as text         copy theModDate to tempDate         set the month of tempDate to January         set M to characters -2 thru -1 of ("0" &amp; 1 + (theModDate - tempDate + 1314864) div 2629728) as text         set Y to characters -1 thru -4 of ((year of theModDate) as text) as text         set hh to "0" &amp; theModDate's hours as text         set hh to characters ((count of hh) - 1) through (count of hh) of hh         set mm to "0" &amp; theModDate's minutes as text         set mm to characters ((count of mm) - 1) through (count of mm) of mm         set ss to "0" &amp; theModDate's seconds as text         set ss to characters ((count of ss) - 1) through (count of ss) of ss         set theDateTxt to (Y &amp; M &amp; D &amp; "T" &amp; hh &amp; mm as text)         set theURL to theURL &amp; theDateTxt         set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ","         do shell script "curl -o ~/test/test.php." &amp; theDateTxt &amp; ".jpg 'http://siteaddress?iso='" &amp; theDateTxt         set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ""     end if     set theDate to theDate + (900) --seconds (1800 is 30 minutes)     set whichUrl to whichUrl + 1 end repeat /code/pre  <comment286763> Thanks Christian! I ended up finding some other code and incorporating it. It works fine just as I'm sure yours would.
