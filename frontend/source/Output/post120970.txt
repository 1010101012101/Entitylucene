I want to install Windows 7 on an external drive <body> I've read two articles about booting Windows from external drives as opposed to a stock Bootcamp install. Here are the links:  http://kevtg-compuproductive.tumblr.com/  http://bleeptobleep.blogspot.fr/2013/02/mac-install-windows-7-or-8-on-external.html  The latter of the two seems more difficult, plus I do not have an external hard drive with USB 3 compatibility, so I think I would use the other one. Though I could just buy a new external drive...  strongHas anyone tried these methods? I want to make sure they're legitimate before I try them./strong  Thanks! :)  <answer216098> For info and future searches ... With steps identical or very similar to those mentionned in the 2nd tuto (BleeptoBleep) i managed to install Windows 8.1 on an external SSD /thunderbolt and a late 2015 iMac 5K 27 retina i7 4G but not Windows 7 due to a potential incompatibility (havent found out the reason) with hardware and/or OS El Capitan (boot disk not showing up after "Alt" start-up with W7 but OK while OK with W8). Managed W7 installation on an older 2014 MacBook with Yosemite OS though, also on another external drive also bypassing the BCA (bootcamp)  <answer216117> I managed to install a Windows 8.1 Pro on a Samsung Portable SSD T1 drive using the following instructions:  http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/18re5z/run_windows_8_off_usb_on_your_mac/  For this purpose, I used a Parallels Desktop virtual machine. Also, since my Windows image file contained a Install.esd file instead of a Install.wim, I had to replace the following command:     ImageX.exe /apply D:\Sources\Install.wim 1 E:   by:     dism /apply-image /imagefile:D:\sources\install.esd /index:1 /ApplyDir:E:\   I admit that I do not know if the same procedure would work for Windows 7.  <comment175427> I tried the second link with a USB3 external drive. I could start the installation but I was stuck because it was unable to boot from the windows partition.
