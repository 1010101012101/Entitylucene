Change Finder folder view for only one folder? <body> Is it possible to, for example, set icon view to be the view for just emone specific folder/em in Finder? It seems as though if I set a folder to icon view (currently the default is list view), opening folders inside that folder cause the opened folder to change to icon view as well. However, I don't want this to happen â€“ I only want to affect the folder that I changed it for.  <answer262308> Go into the folder and choose the view you want the folder to display as. Press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdJ/kbd, then check the "Always open in [type] view" box at the top of the small window and make sure that the "Browse in [type] view" option is unchecked. Close that window. Now the Finder should switch the view to the one you chose whenever you enter that folder.
