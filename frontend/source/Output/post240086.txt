rMBP random unexpected shutdown <body> Recently I'm facing random unexpected shutdown on rMBP mid-2014. I've clean installed the Yosemite with clean user and issue still continues. Apple online support suggested to work on Safe Mode and it didn't shutdown.  P.S.: I was working on Brackets code editor (http://brackets.io) when the first unexpected shutdown happened.  I inferred there is an issue with Intel Iris Pro, so I decide to delete the following kext file and the device didn't shutdown  precodeAppleIntelBDWGraphics.kext AppleIntelBDWGraphicsFramebuffer.kext AppleIntelBDWGraphicsGLDriver.bundle AppleIntelBDWGraphicsVADriver.bundle AppleIntelBDWGraphicsVAME.bundle AppleIntelHD3000Graphics.kext AppleIntelHD3000GraphicsGA.plugin AppleIntelHD3000GraphicsGLDriver.bundle AppleIntelHD3000GraphicsVADriver.bundle AppleIntelHD4000Graphics.kext AppleIntelHD4000GraphicsGLDriver.bundle AppleIntelHD4000GraphicsVADriver.bundle AppleIntelHD5000Graphics.kext AppleIntelHD5000GraphicsGLDriver.bundle AppleIntelHD5000GraphicsVADriver.bundle AppleIntelHDGraphics.kext AppleIntelHDGraphicsFB.kext AppleIntelHDGraphicsGA.plugin AppleIntelHDGraphicsGLDriver.bundle AppleIntelHDGraphicsVADriver.bundle /code/pre  So what are your thoughts? Thanks  <answer240199> It's possible that a hardware issue is causing the panics.  You can try booting the laptop while holding the D key, this will run a quick diagnostic.  Next step would be to bring it in for service, they'll run better diagnostics to see its condition, and send it out for repair.  <answer259976> I sent my laptop to two service centres and they said there is not any hardware issues. So I decided to clean install Mac OS X without installing any additional software but the problem still occurs.  Note: I also installed Windows 10 using bootcamp, the machine works without any unexpected shutdown issues.  I got this console log (http://pastebin.com/irLDsEhB), maybe these lines can help you identify this annoying issue.  Thanks  <comment294961> Welcome to Ask Different!

In Terminal, issue the command `syslog | grep -i "shutdown cause" and post the output
