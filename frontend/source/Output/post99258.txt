How to listen to my iPod on an other computer? <body> I have an iPod and it is synchronised on a computer A.  I would like to listen to my music on another computer B, on which iTunes 11 is installed.  When I connect the iPod on the computer B, I am able to see all the screens related to the settings, such as img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Ga12.png" alt="enter image description here" or img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gboKg.png" alt="enter image description here" but I don't know how to actually access the content of the iPod to play the music.  Is it possible ?  And, if yes, what should I do  ?  hr  EDIT : When I click on "Sur cet iPod" ("On this iPod"), I am able to see the content of the iPod but it seems that I canno't play it... Any advice ? Here is the screen :img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wRlNH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer99261> When your iPod is plugged in, just go to codeSur cet iPod/code (On this iPod) and you can actually play the music from your iPod.   <answer154932> You just need to set the iPod to manually manage music  http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/playing-your-iPod-through-iTunes.html  <comment116700> So easy !! And can I play this music ? <comment116701> Yes. But it will stop when you unplug your iPod. <comment116702> Thanks a lot !!! but (see the edit), the songs are "grayed" and it seems that I canno't play them ! <comment116708> Ate the tw computers on the same network - if so use shared libraries and you don't need to involve the iPod <comment116711> The other computer is not here !!! <comment116726> Were the grayed out songs downloaded from iTunes, and possibly require that you authenticate that computer before than can be played? <comment116765> Some of them were downloaded from iTunes, but others were imported from a CD. But, both are grayed !
