How do you remove a hyperlink from a cell in Numbers '08 version 1.0.3? <body> I have an address in a cell which is hyperlinked. I've also searched other posts on the topic and the selecting text and "right-clicking" does not bring up a menu with how to remove the link. I'd really appreciate some help if anyone's worked out how to do this.  <answer222540> Select the hyperlinked text then kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdK/kbd.  This will bring up the Link dialog where you can remove the link via the strongRemove/strong button.  One can also change the link here as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9eTM.png" alt="Remove hyperlink"
