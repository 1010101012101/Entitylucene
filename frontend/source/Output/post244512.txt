Mac mini wont shutdown <body> I can't shutdown my Late 2012 Mac mini, running El Capitan, in the normal way, by selecting the Shut Down... on the Apple menu. Every time I try, Finder vanishes and the shutdown progress freezes. I'm still able to work with the Dock, so I can shutdown using Terminal. In long term it's really annoying.  Hopefully someone has an idea whats wrong.  [EDIT] I just found out that im able to shut the system down by sign out and them use the displayed shutdown on the bottom.  <answer244516> If you can acess terminal just do.   precodesudo reboot /code/pre  or   precodesudo shutdown /code/pre  that should reboot or shut down your system. when using sudo it will ask for a password this is the same as when you login to your profile.   Hope this helps  <answer244521> ol liClose all Mac OS X apps before shutting down/li liTry to determine if one particular app is causing the problem. Maybe one app always aborts the shutdown process. Try updating to the latest version./li liOpen Disk Utility. Choose the your main hard drive and click Repair Disk./li liUsefully shutdown freezes are caused by incompatible or outdated drivers e.g printer, scanner software. Open OS X activity monitor. Do you see any high cpu processes or unresponsive applications that are marked red?/li /ol  <comment301348> this might also help you  [Click here for link](http://askubuntu.com/questions/578144/why-doesnt-running-sudo-shutdown-now-shutdown) <comment301350> Timm already knows how to shutdown using Terminal, after all he did say "_I'm still able to work with the Dock, so I can shutdown using Terminal. In long term it's really annoying._"  Additionally providing a link to Ubuntu... well Ubuntu is Linux and OS X is not Linux. E.g `sudo init 0` in the accepted answer doesn't work in OS X El Capitan.  His issue is with trying to shutdown from the Apple menu and nothing in the link you provided is relevant to it. <comment301364> I had already run the Disk Utility, it didn't helped. I really can't see any applications bottlenecking my shutdown progress. <comment301365> Take a look at the system log file  (Applications  Utiliies  Console). Do you see any error messages while shutting down?  Do you use a Wacom driver? Do you use Java?  If so, try uninstall/reinstall them. <comment301369> Alright I unimstalled my Wacom tablet driver, I don't use it anyway. Still no improvement. <comment301370> It’s hard to debug. We don’t know which Third-Party Application you are running in the background. Thus, I can only guess which App might cause shutdown freezes.   Do you use Little Snitch, any kind of Antivirus software or additional video-and audio driver like Cubase, Protools, Avid, Final Cut? Take a look at the system log file (Applications  Utiliies  Console). Do you see any error messages while shutting down? <comment301374> I edited my post, im able to shotdown after singing out. I can't really see any errors in the console. I will have a closer look this evening. <comment301447> now it's working just fine. Probably it was the Wacom driver, how did you knew? But I also started in OS X Recovery and run Reset Homefolder Permissions ans ACLs by  `resetpassword`.
