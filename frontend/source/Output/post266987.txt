How can I find out which files are using so much space? <body> I've been mainly using my macbook pro as a development station for my first 3 years of a CS degree. Now I see that it's starting to get full, 158gb/256gb is in use.  Thing is, I can't for the life of my figure out where all this data is stored/used!  I've desynced my dropbox/Gdrive/oneDrive so that they dont use any space on my local machine.  I've removed all the files that I know I don't need, like already synced github files, photos, videos etc. I've uninstalled what I dont need through brew.  But there seems to be so much data in use and I can't for the life of me figure out where it is and how to remove it.  Running codedf -h/code gets my this output:   precodeFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1     232Gi  158Gi   74Gi    69% 41546792 19279802   68%   / /code/pre  Can anyone help me find out where and how to remove a lot of this to free up space. I mainly want to free space to make room for a windows 10 boot camp installation.
