Can I cancel this neverending message move in Mail.app? <body> A few days ago, I decided to move nearly 80,000 messages from an IMAP server to a Gmail server using Mail.app on Sierra 10.12.1:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VzHOf.png" alt="Mail.app Activity window showing two tasks: &quot;Moving Messages, 4 of 79,718&quot;, &quot;Checking for Mail…&quot;"  This task still hasn't completed.  "Checking for Mail…" comes and goes as one might expect, and normal mail functionality seems to work fine. Connection Doctor shows nothing strange.   However, this task has been going on for days, and moves emvery slowly/em—I've left the computer on all night and it only chews through a few thousand, occasionally stopping with an error. If I restart Mail.app (it takes a bit to quit), it eventually comes back up with the same 79,718 messages needing to be moved.  Is there any way to terminate this process? I'm inclined to try another tool at this point, but I'd like Mail.app to stop trying to move these messages.  <answer261536> Two things which come to mind that you could try are:  ul lipressing the kbdCommand/kbd + kbd./kbd keys/li lipressing the  kbdESC/kbd key /li /ul  Either way you may need to do this a few times and wait for the task to register what you're doing.  <comment327552> Both of those close the activity window immediately, but don't actually terminate the activity, unfortunately.
