Ways to scroll with a mouse without the wheel or dragging the scroll bar <body> Is there any other means of scrolling using a mouse besides the wheel or dragging the scroll bars on the right side of the window.  Using the wheel is not good for me ergonomically and it is a hassle to move the pointer to the narrow scroll bar and drag that up and down.  In Firefox you clicking the middle button goes into a special mode that enables scrolling by moving the mouse up and down.  But as far as I know Chrome and other applications don't have that feature.  <answer197034> Looks like someone already answered this on SuperUser  SmartScroll is a third party app I've not used, but appears to enable this.   <comment235492> Can you specify which mouse you have, whether you are using a Mac, and the Operating System you are using? <comment235516> My apologies for the initial sloppy formatting.
