The trackpad doesn't work when starting Windows 7 bootcamp <body> I installed Windows 7 (bootcamp) on my MacBook but it doesn't work. Do I have to install special drivers?  Any help is appreciated.  <answer126241> Please check out TrackPad++. It's free with an option to donate.  I've used this in the past, when I had bootcamp with Windows 7 - you can set gestures like you can in Mac OS X.  <comment150789> I successfully installed TrackPad++ but still doesn't work.
