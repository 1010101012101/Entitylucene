Is it possible to display my iphone LIVE on desktop or macbook, and use the mouse to click? <body> Is it possible to display my iphone LIVE on desktop or macbook, and use the mouse to click?  For example if I need to click with my mouse on an app etc?  Thank you  <comment344584> You can use a simulator with Xcode to get this, but that's not *your* iPhone. <comment344588> There are 3rd-party applications that allow you to see your iPhone on your desktop live, but you can't click the icons because it's just a video of your screen. <comment344596> no you can't do that, however you can copy your iPhone screen to your computer with quicktime or third party applications
