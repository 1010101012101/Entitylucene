If I upload a Time Machine backup folder to Google Drive, will any information be lost like hard links? <body> I would like to take a Time Machine backup, under a folder called "Backups.backupdb" and click and drag it into Google Drive. I am wondering if this process will cause any hard links or anything like that to be deleted? My question basically is, if I were to upload it to Google Drive, then download it in the future, would it be readily usable as a backup to restore a computer?  <comment373654> Have you considered using Google's Backup and Sync to backup your files? If you really want to upload your Time Machine backup though, it might be best to create a disk image from it and upload that instead, but you'd have to do some additional research to check whether and how you can then restore from it: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22247?locale=en_US
