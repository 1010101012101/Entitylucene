Update Multiple Keychain entries <body> Is there a way to run an automator script to update multiple keychain entries at once?  I have a client that is part of an AD and when they update their pw it doesn't update the keychain.  I am looking for a way to update multiple entries at once.  Thanks  <answer116600> h3The CLI for keychains is security./h3  It lets you do many things such as setting passwords:  precodesecurity add-generic-password [-a account] [-s service] [-w password] [options...] [-A|-T appPath] [keychain] /code/pre  Read the man page for more info or do codesecurity help/code.
