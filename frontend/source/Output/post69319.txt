How can I assign custom colors to groups in a dispersion chart in Numbers? <body> I have a table with measurements of the runtime of different sorting algorithms. This data should be shown in a chart, with the number of items on the X axis and the runtime on the Y axis. To make the X axis on scale, I used a dispersion chart.  Numbers automatically picks some colors for the different groups of data. However, I'd like to choose different colors. I was only able to change the color of the trend line, but this didn't change the color in the legend.  How can I change the color so that the change is visible in the legend as well?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0U6u.png" alt="Problem situation"  <answer69336> Just called AppleCare. The guy took some time to make a chart and afterwards explained that I could click the line to change the color (just as I did before). While we were talking I clicked a dot in the graph, representing a data point. It turned out that you could change the color of the dots the same way. This color was applied to the legend, so the problem was solved.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q2YCx.png" alt="Solution"
