Are these Canon websites safe to download printer software? <body> I'd like some drivers for printer. Is Canon site safe to download them as self-installed trojans are Mac's worst nightmare and I have no real time scanner to detect if something comes in.  Google gives me both sites, but is there any difference?  https://www.usa.canon.com  http://www.canon-europe.com  I just find it weird one is canon.com while other canon-europe.com - if it is same company, shouldn't it be europe.canon.com...  Not sure what to trust or to trust either at all.  And connecting printer to Mac will not offer download so I need this...  <answer265998> You can check the signature/authenticity of a downloaded package installer (*.pkg) quickly yourself - independent of the shabby look of a website:  Open Terminal and enter codepkgutil --check-signature/code. Then open the downloaded dmg image and drop the pkg onto the Terminal window and hit the enter key:  precodepkgutil --check-signature  /Volumes/PrinterDriver_MG8100\ series/PrinterDriver_MG8100\ series_161000.pkg  Package "PrinterDriver_MG8100 series_161000.pkg":    Status: signed by a certificate trusted by Mac OS X    Certificate Chain:     1.

Does it have a website on it. (normally this is present)    The 2nd part is the URL itself.  URL's are read opposite from the way english is read.  URL's are read from right to left starting with .com .org .net .gov etc.    so   "www.canon.com-ok.com"br is not taking you to canon.com but to com-ok.com      You didn't mention if you were in the US or EU.  EU devices may have different power requirements and model #'s from the manufacturer.  <comment333561> Yes it's legitimate. Both sites link to each other in their sites. If you choose one site and change your location to the other site, it'll send you there. <comment333562> usa.canon.com is legitimate. Note the https, also did a whois and it's registered to canon (of course it is, it's just canon.com). Not sure about canon-europe.com, that's a weird one (also note the lack of https). <comment333564> @NoahL Thank you! <comment333565> @owlswipe Good point, didn't notice that myself. Yeah, europe one looks shabby too. I'll be using US one then. Thanks! <comment333572> I had no idea this was even possible! :D Does Gatekeeper use these to check the downloaded packages when opening them? <comment333573> @user216602 I think so ;-) <comment333584> EU, but I checked the driver numbers on both US and Europe site, they were identical.
