What is causing a black screen while switching spaces on Mountain Lion? <body> On Lion I used to see the next space wallpaper while pressing kbdControl/kbd + kbdâ†’/kbd to switch desktops. But on Mountain Lion I see a Black Screen until the transition is complete. Is it just me who is facing this issue or is this the new behaviour in Mountain Lion?  <answer62154> Its now resolved. It was not an issue with OSX. I was using a software called ScreenShade which was causing this issue. Disabling ScreenShade resolved the issue.  <comment71766> That's not the intended behavior. Does it happen on other accounts or a guest account? <comment71781> This is currently happening on my main admin account. I will try creating other account and report back in a minute :) <comment75670> same thing happens with Isolator (http://willmore.eu/software/isolator/) <comment256998> Happened to me in OSX El Capitan. The cause was 'Console'. Closed it and the black screen vanished.
