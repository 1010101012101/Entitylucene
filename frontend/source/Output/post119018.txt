I finally got this  precode.........$ which ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg /code/pre  <answer119021> h1Removal/h1  If you installed with HomeBrew, the following Terminal.app command will perform the uninstall:  precodebrew uninstall ffmpeg /code/pre  If you are not sure how you installed codeffmpeg/code, try running the command alone. The output will include a line containing the binary's location on your Mac:  precodeffmpeg /code/pre  Look for output similar to:  precodeffmpeg version 1.2.4 Copyright (c) 2000-2013 the FFmpeg developers   built on Nov 21 2013 11:36:01 with Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn)   configuration: --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/1.2.4 â€¦ /code/pre  The key information in this extract is code/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg//code; this provides the location and that codeffmpeg/code was installed as a HomeBrew Cellar.  If you do not see this output or it does not mention Cellar, please expand your question with the output you do see.  h2Alternative Installations/h2  It is critical to know how you installed codeffmpeg/code in order to know how to remove it. If may just be removing a folder, or it may be hunting around in code/usr/local//code and code/usr/bin/code folders for installed binaries.  Easy removal and upgrading is a strong argument for using a package manager for command line tools. Well supported package managers on the Mac include brew and MacPorts.  h2Re-installation/h2  To install codeffmpeg/code again, after removing the prior version, use brew to handle the entire process with:  precodebrew install ffmpeg /code/pre  <comment138794> How did you install `ffmpeg`? Did you use a package manager like home brew or MacPorts? Maybe a pre-packaged installer pkg? <comment138797> yes I have brew.but I could not remove ffmpeg. <comment138806> it does not uninstall when I type brew uninstall ffmpeg.dhcp-31-66:~ samirebalta$ ffmpeg ffmpeg version 2.1.git Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the FFmpeg developers   built on Jan 28 2014 01:43:39 with Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn)   configuration:   ... Hyper fast Audio and Video encoder usage: ffmpeg [options] [[infile options] -i infile]... {[outfile options] outfile}...  Use -h to get full help or, even better, run 'man ffmpeg'  what can I do now? <comment138808> Please can you expand your question with the complete output you do see from `ffmpeg`. The content after `configuration:` is key. <comment138813> Sadly no configuration information in the output. Use brew to install a new copy of `ffmpeg`. If brew is set up correctly, `brew doctor`, the latest brew edition of `ffmpeg` will override any older copies. <comment138817> Where is ffmpeg - try `which ffmpeg` <comment138964> thnx I expanded <comment138982> Please can you try @Mark suggestion of `which ffmpeg` and append the output to your answer. <comment139148> @mark it is done
