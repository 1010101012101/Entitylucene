How to get iMessages from receiver on OS X Mavericks? <body> By imessage, I can send and get message from another Apple ID. Message history is storing in code/Users/username/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages/code  (on my mac)   In that directory, there are Archive and attachments (alias). I can see all my messages and my receiver's messages.  I wonder whether I get the messages from my receiver by specific language like php, javascript, or other thing else ? How can I get those messages ?   <answer149083> I couldn't figure out how to see only messages sent by other people, but you can see the text of all messages (and some other strings) by running:  codefor f in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages/Archive/*/*.ichat;do plutil -convert xml1 "$f" -o -|ruby -rplist -e 'puts Plist.parse_xml(STDIN.read)["$objects"].select{|x|x.is_a?(Hash)&amp;&amp;x["NS.string"]}.map{|x|x["NS.string"]}';done/code  codesudo gem install plist/code installs the codeplist/code gem.
