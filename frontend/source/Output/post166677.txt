Changing dev environment to Homebrew <body> I'm a new mac user and I'm going to start using Homebrew to build my environment. My current environment I've installed piece by piece. What I want to check is what to make sure I do, so I don't get conflicts and i'm not running a load of software that I don't need.  Is this just a case of through the terminal uninstalling, apache, php, mysql etc and clearing out my usr/local/ folder and starting with homebrew?  <answer166954> You can leave your existing installations in place for the time being.  Homebrew will error if it has to overwrite an existing file in the process of installing a package.  <comment195901> I did in the end remove everything from my local folder and go with homebrew. It seemed to have gone ok.
