Remote assistance for Macs <body> What is currently the best remote assistance/remote desktop application for Macs?  I think unattended access (no remote user needed) and file transfer would be useful.  Teamviewer seems to fit the bill, but I am not a Mac guy so I was wondering if there were other/better options for the Mac.  <answer156905> Check Apple Remote Desktop.     Apple Remote Desktop is the best way to manage the Mac computers on your network. Distribute software, provide real-time online help to end users, create detailed software and hardware reports, and automate routine management tasksâ€”all without leaving your desk. Featuring Automator actions and Remote Spotlight search, Apple Remote Desktop makes your job easier than ever.   Power Copy:br The file-copy engine in Apple Remote Desktop supports 64-bit file sizes, network bandwidth limits, and optional encryption of data streams.  <answer156907> I use TeamViewer since years.  From Mac - to PC or Mac.  From USA to Europe.  <comment184500> Over internet or just your LAN? <comment184509> over the internet <comment184673> Well it looks like TeamViewer is the best option.
