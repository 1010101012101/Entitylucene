Windows 10 will not boot anymore <body> Urgent! I have an existing Windows 10 installation via Bootcamp which has been on my Mac for months without issue. However for ages I have been wanting to read my Mac partition from Windows which it doesn't allow me to do, so I looked online which suggested making a third partition for both OS's to read from.  So I made a 10GB partition on Disk Utility which worked fine, and my Bootcamp drive is still there strong(it wasn't formatted, I can still view all Windows files from OS X)/strong, only problem now is Windows will not boot! If I hold down alt at the white screen, only my Mac partition shows up. When I go to system preferences and choose boot options, bootcamp is still there!? I removed the 10GB partition but it has not remedied the problem... I don't get it, please help!!  <answer218001> I can help you if you've a live USB linux distribution, ex.
