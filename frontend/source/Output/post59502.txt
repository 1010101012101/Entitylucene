Has anyone figured out a keyboard shortcut to globally strikethrough selected text in any OS X app? <body> We have kbd⌘/kbdkbdB/kbd to bold, kbd⌘/kbdkbdI/kbd to italicise, kbd⌘/kbdkbdU/kbd to underline, but we don't (as far as I can tell) have a shortcut to strikethrough selected text in strongany/strong OS X rich editor.   I added a keyboard shortcut into System Preferences, but that way doesn't work very consistently. I also tried using TextExpander, but it doesn't support rich text formatting.  Has anyone come up with a way to do this?  <answer59504> Shortcuts created in System Preferences will only work globally with applications that have matching Strikethrough options in their menu. This is not a feature that all rich text editors provide, thus the inconsistencies you experienced.  Nevertheless, TextExpander does support rich text formatting. When creating a new snippet click the "Content" header above the snippet and select "Formatted Text, Pictures." You could use this to store a small sample of strikethrough text to use the formatting of. This is sort of a painful workaround, but it should suffice in the majority of applications. You will probably encounter a few exceptions where this will not work.  The simplest solution is built into Mountain Lion. Select any text in a rich text editor and codeCTRL+Click/code (right-click) on it. Select the FontStyles img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DjB86.png" alt="Selecting Font Styles from Context Menu" A new menu pops up. Select "Favorite Styles" and then select "Struck through" from the drop down menu. Now click Apply.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UYHG1.png" alt="Favorite Styles Menu"  Your text will now be struck through. Keep in mind this Font menu may not appear in all rich text editors and others may not display struck through text at all.  <answer102464> an even quicker way is to use the upper left corner with with the little drop down menu with the paragraph symbol.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CMLG2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer111872> Hey I just came across this question because today I just started to use Stickies as a To-Do list for things I need to finish over the day and I also wanted to have that feature that you strongemstrikethrough/em/strong items or text you are done with…  I think an easy workaround for this is that you have lets say 3 items, then you go to mark your first item with the emstrikethrough/em from the Fonts panel and then select that all the item and go to strongFont  Copy Style/strong (kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdC/kbd) and then because it is copied in the Stickies app, after, anytime you use the shortcut kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdV/kbd (strongPaste Style/strong) over a selected item it will paste the strikethrough style anytime later on the app, even if you have any other copied item in your clipboard.  <answer118268> Shortcut key is kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdX/kbd.   <answer123814> kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdX/kbd works in MS Excel for Mac 2011.  <answer143760> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QhzN5.png" alt="enter image description here"You can cross through individual characters in Safari and other Mac docs by:  1 In Safari (or other) Toolbar, Click 'Edit'  'Special Characters'  2 In pop-up's 'Search' box type: "combining long stroke overlay" and click on the '-' that   comes up under the 'Unicode' heading at the bottom of the central column in the box  3 Click 'Add to Favourites' box  4 The Special Characters pop-up can be left open and dragged to a convenient area of the screen whilst completing Safari docs etc (I use it for writing foreign language rules in Quizlet).
