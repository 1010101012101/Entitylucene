Time Machine can't find AFP/SMB shares <body> I have an Ubuntu NAS setup with both SMB and AFP shares, both of which I can access from my Windows machines and Macbook Air. I have also verified that I can copy files to these shares from my MBA.  But Time Machine on Lion doesn't show any of these shares, only "Set Up Other Time Capsule". What do I need to do for it to show these shares?  I've tried codedefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1/code and codedefaults read com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes/code returns code1/code.  <answer21508> You need to use netatalk 2.2, which is the only version that supports Time Machine backups from Lion.   <comment23764> Awesome thanks! I just returned my MBA, so won't be able to test this in a while, but will accept your answer for now. If anyone wonders, the version in Ubuntu 11.04's repo is 2.1.4
