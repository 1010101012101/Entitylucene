Why isn't search working in Finder? <body> In Finder, the search bar in the top right corner has ceased to function. Observe:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9JIMi.png" alt="failed search"  Obviously, there ishould/i be something with the letter "s" in it. But no results appear. It's just blank. Anything I search for, anywhere I search for it, it all fails.  <answer26982> strikeOther than your Finder having jaundice/strike, this should be a simple fix. The following command will clear the volumes local store and rebuild it if necessary; Open up Terminal and type:  precode# sudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  ul liYou will be asked for your password, provide it, as this command requires administrator privileges to run./li liAfter confirming your Spotlight index will be re-built and your files should appear in the search. ( Depending on the size of your HDD it can take a while )/li /ul  hr  To check if all volumes have indexing enabled or disabled use:  precode# mdutil -s -a /code/pre  To toggle (enable/disable) indexing on all volumes:   precode# mdutil -a -i /code/pre  These commands are safe to use when/if you encounter similar issues as described in the question.  hr  Complete options available:  precode -p  Spotlight caches indexes of some network devices locally.  This option requests      that a local caches be flushed to the appropriate network device.   -E  This flag will cause each local store for the volumes indicated to be erased.      The stores will be rebuilt if appropriate.   -i on | off      Sets the indexing status for the provided volumes to on or off.  Note that index-      ing may be delayed due to low disk space or other conditions.   -s  Display the indexing status of the listed volumes.   -a  Apply command to all volumes.   -v  Print verbose information when available. /code/pre  ul limdutil(1) Mac OS X Manual Page/li /ul  <answer30127> Being as the UI is a better way to go than to jump right away into Terminal, try the following from Apple's support documentation:  ol liFrom the Apple menu, choose System Preferences./li liClick Spotlight./li liClick the Privacy tab./li liDrag a folder or even an entire volume (your hard drive) to the list./li liRemove the item or volume you just added./li /ol  Failing these steps and the steps advised by the others, try creating a new user and seeing if search works in Finder. If it still does not work, then search is broken system-wide and an Archive &amp; Install will not help. You'll want to back up your data and reinstall the OS. If an Apple Store is close, they can be of assistance here (no charge).  <comment30870> This worked, thank you very much. <comment30871> heh, looks like it got over it ;-) <comment30872> Yep, I realized it was disturbingly yellow, and switched it to a more soothing grey. <comment30873> No problem at all -- quick and easy. Make sure you check the answer as correct. take care. <comment30874> I will, once it lets me. Another 2 minutes. <comment34022> This worked at first, now I'm back to the same old problem, but this just says "Indexing and Searching Disabled" when I put it in Terminal. <comment34275> @Mahnax is indexing enabled? To turn it on (or to make sure it's on) for all volumes, use `sudo mdutil -a -i on` in Terminal and then use the command @ioi provided. <comment34447> Just curious, is a little wheel (or gear) spinning in the right-hand corner? <comment34474> @daviesgeek Nope. <comment34550> Can you please open your activity monitor and check if mdworker service is running? <comment34589> @doc_180 Not on my Mac right now, but when I get home I'll do that. <comment35044> @Mahnax, you can check the status of spotlight indexing by using: `mdutil -s -a`. This will display if any volume is `enabled` or `disabled` for indexing. The command @koiyu has provided is a toggle switch to enable or disable indexing. I'm disappointed you unaccepted my answer, oh well. Happy indexing! <comment35098> Sorry, but it just stopped working. If that works, I'd suggest adding it to your answer, and I'll re-accept for good. <comment35165> No worries at all. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you too, since there aren't too many more `mdutil` commands left in the playbook. <comment35345> So it would seem.
