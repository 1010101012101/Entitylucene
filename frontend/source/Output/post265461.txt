how to swipe Mail in iOS <body> I don't remember if I was using android or the gmail app, but I was able to swipe to move to the next or previous mail (in any of the mail apps).  I am now using an iPhone, so how can I achieve this? is it configurable? another mail app?  <answer265485> Apple's native mail app doesn't allow swipe to work that way on iPhone since swipes are for marking / archiving / moving or deleting by design.  On larger iOS devices - portrait mode works the same as the iPhone (non S size) but landscape mode has a navigation sidebar for navigating.  It's not a swipe, but it helps triage mails for me.  You might look at Inbox by Gmail on iOS - it has a snooze feature that could be used to swipe past mails like tinder allows you to swipe to filter and file a queue of people.
