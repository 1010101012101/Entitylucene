Can't install Homebrew on MacBook Pro, password field won't input <body> I need to install Homebrew. I am unable to input the password when prompted in the Terminal - nothing happens when I type, only when I hit enter. I follow the instructions specified in the book I'm reading (Byte of Python). First, I enter:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)" /code/pre  I get:  precodePress ENTER to continue or any other key to abort tests MacBook-Pro:.ssh kevinadler$ organization21 bash: organization21: command not found tests MacBook-Pro:.ssh kevinadler$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)" ==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/Library/... /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1 ==&gt; The following directories will be made group writable: /usr/local/. /usr/local/bin ==&gt; The following directories will have their group set to admin: /usr/local/. /usr/local/bin Press ENTER to continue or any other key to abort ==&gt; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /usr/local/. /usr/local/bin WARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss or the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your typing when using sudo. Type "man sudo" for more information. To proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort. Password: Sorry, try again. Password: /code/pre  Any ideas how to enable me to enter my password?   <answer228662> Correct. The password does not show up its appearance, but you just type it correctly anyway, and then it'll bring you to the next "Intallation successful". Good luck.  <comment89910> Are you actually typing your password when prompted? The terminal will not show any characters for a password entry (not even masked) but they actually are being entered. Type the password and then `return`. <comment92967> Are you entering a line at a time or pasting a whole lot at once. I assume organization21 is your password and this should not be entered until after the sudo which will prompt you for it <comment92968> Also you don't need Homebre to install python - a version is included in the Apple supplied install
