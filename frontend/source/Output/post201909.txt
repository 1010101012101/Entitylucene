Mac mail prevent mark as read <body> I am working on a mac running OSX 10.10.5 and I am using Apple mail. When I am reading an email I want to prevent the email from being marked as read instantly. I would rather mark it myself, or have it wait like 2 minutes before it marks it as read.   I know about the terminal delay trick, but that doesn't work. The Truepreview plugin hasn't been updated for a long time and doesn't work anymore. Are there any alternatives?  <answer201912> It is not possible by default, but you can download a plugin for the Mail app. The plugin is called TruePreview. It is said that it supports OS X Mountain Lion and below, but I had it working on my Mavericks machine.  Anyway, here's the method:  ul liQuit the Mail app/li liDownload TruePreview (scroll down for latest versions) and run the installer/li liLaunch Mail.app and open Preferences, click on the  arrow and select “TruePreview”/li liAdjust the emMark as Read/em settings as desired/li /ul  Have a read on this page and you'll find that there is a Terminal command that can be used to delay the Mark As Read setting. However, I'm not sure you can disable it completely.  precodedefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay 2 /code/pre  Here, 2 is a measurement of the number of seconds to delay.  precodedefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay /code/pre  The above will just revert the setting back to its default state.  Alternatively, if you're okay with marking it as unread, an easier option would be to use a keyboard shortcut instead of manually marking as unread. The standard keyboard shortcut, which toggles “read” and “unread”, is kbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdu/kbd. You can also go to emSystem Preferences/em → emKeyboard/em to customise your own keyboard shortcut.  Have a look, see which options takes you where, and stick with whatever is comfortable. Let me know if anything went wrong during the plugin installation (that is, if you emdid/em install it).  <answer273312> To enable this, install the add-on Mail Act-On. Note: it is quite expensive at $32.00/€32,00, but there is a 30-day trial if you'd like to test it out.  After installing it, go to strongMail.app  Preferences  Mail Act-On  Message Viewing/strong and then you can  ol liMark a message read after a certain delay, from 0 to 30 seconds, or/li liPrevent messages from being automatically marked read at all./li /ol  It works on macOS Sierra.  <comment243466> Did you even read my text? I said both the Trueview plugin and the terminal defaults trick don't work anymore <comment243468> Sorry, didn't read the bottom, guess I was paying attention to something else :/ but have a look at [this page.](http://blog.macsales.com/18937-enabling-plugins-for-os-x-mail-that-stopped-working-with-10-8-4-update)  I believe it should work. <comment243471> That's okay, it happens to the best of us ;) I will try that when I get back to work tomorrow morning and let you know if it worked. <comment243646> Sadly, this trick doesn't work anymore on the newer versions of Mac mail :( Thanks anyway
