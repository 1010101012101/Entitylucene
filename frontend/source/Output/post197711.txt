Connect Apple Thunderbolt to Lenovo T420s <body> I have an Apple Thunderbolt Display 27 inch, Part MC914LL/A and I'd like to know if there is a way I could connect it to my Lenovo T420s ThinkPad.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpmoAm.jpg" alt="Cables"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wp61jm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer197717> The cables in the top photo are of a MagSafe connector for an Apple laptop, (on the right,) and either a Thunderbolt or Apple DisplayPort connector, (on the left.)  The Lenovo has the standard VGA 15-pin and a DisplayPort (VESA) output which supports a single-link DVI-D 45J7915 cable. It is not compatible unless you can find a VESA DisplayPort to Apple Mini DisplayPort adaptor.  Perhaps the Lenovo 45J7915 cable &lt; M-M DVI-D cable &lt; Apple Mini DisplayPort/DVI would work for you. I cannot predict if it will.  YMMV.  <comment236407> Does the T420S has a Thunderbolt plug ?
