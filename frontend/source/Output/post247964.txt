Transfer Live Photos to another folder on Macbook <body> I am able to upload Live Photos from my iPhone to Macbook. I am able to view the Live Photos within Photos.app. However, when I transfer a Live Photo from 'Photos Library.photoslibrary' to another location only a still .jpg is saved.  How can I transfer Live Photos to other locations on my Macbook - keeping them Live?  <answer248050> From Macworld.com:     Option-drag an image into the Finder or select File  Export  Export   Unmodified Original For [X] Photo(s) are both the unmodified JPEG and   the associated MOV retrieved.      You can also use the Image Capture app with an iPhone connected via   USB, select the iPhone, choose Live Photos images, and then import   them, and both the JPEG and MOV for each image are transferred.
