I am downloading something with 300~1200kb/s? Any help? <body> Today I noticed that my system is downloading something and the download speed is around 300~1200kb/s. I tried everything that I could thing of... installed Little Snitch 3 and I did not see anything wrong.  I think that I noticed is that I get those messages in my console.  precodeNov 19 01:36:52 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 7670 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:36:54 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 7408 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:36:55 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 3950 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:36:57 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 8660 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:36:59 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 8187 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:37:00 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 3959 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:37:02 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 7670 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:37:03 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 3638 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:37:05 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 6837 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:37:06 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 3202 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:37:08 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 6691 to 250 packets per second Nov 19 01:37:09 Mirkos-Mac-Pro kernel[0]: Limiting closed port RST response from 3017 to 250 packets per second /code/pre  Other thing that I did is to monitor all my hard drive activity, and don't see where all that data goes.
