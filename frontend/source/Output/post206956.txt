Time Machine could not delete the backup disk image...!!! <body> I have a GoFlex Home external drive that has worked well for a long time. Every once in a while I have to change settings, but can always fix it. This latest problem has been going on for weeks. I keep getting the message that my Time Machine backup failed and that it needs to create a new backup. I click OK and that fails. I finally looked into the problem today and found advice on another site that I should change my passwords. I did that and it appeared that the new backup would start. Then I got this message: "Time Machine could not delete the backup disk image."  I can access the GoFlex drive preferences online and wipe all existing backups, but that doesn't fix the problem.  I clicked "Get Info" on the sparsebundle file and it is locked. I can unlock it, but it won't stay unlocked. Before I check into a mental hospital, can someone suggest another solution?  <comment249590> Could you erase and reformat the drive containing the backups? <comment249631> I haven't tried that yet. I was hoping to avoid totally erasing everything just in case I couldn't retrieve everything. <comment249675> Try using `bypass` from the command line.
