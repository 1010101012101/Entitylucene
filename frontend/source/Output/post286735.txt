How do I disable screen dimming *only during sunset*? <body> Screen dimming is a great feature when moving to differently lit rooms. However, if the MacBook is facing a bright window, and the user is thus backlit, then the sensor goes haywire.   I need to create some of script to disable auto-dim during sunset hours.  How can I access the dimmer feature from bash, AppleScript, or any other language?   <answer286740> You can do it by following the instructions from here provided by codedaviesgeek/code  Dimmer:   precodetell application "System Events"         key code 107     end tell /code/pre  Brighter:    precodetell application "System Events"         key code 113     end tell /code/pre  You can save these as .script files and then run them from the CLI like this:  precodeosascript ~/Path/to/File /code/pre  You can also do it this way, but that requires more setup.  <answer286745> This AppleScript may or may not work on your system.  On my Mac book Pro running the latest version of Sierra, this following code enables the "Automatically adjust brightness" checkbox If your current time is between 6 am and 6 pm, Otherwise it disables that checkbox If it is already selected.  precodeif hours of (current date) is greater than 6 then     if hours of (current date) is less than 18 then         tell application "System Preferences"             reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.displays"         end tell         tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences" to tell window "Built-in Retina Display"             tell checkbox "Automatically adjust brightness" of group 2 of tab group 1 to if value is 0 then click         end tell     else         tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences" to tell window "Built-in Retina Display"             tell checkbox "Automatically adjust brightness" of group 2 of tab group 1 to if value is 1 then click         end tell     end if end if tell application "System Preferences"     quit end tell /code/pre  You can adjust the hours values at the top of the script to suit your needs  If your display preferences looks like this picture... This script should work for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8OLl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment361898> Possible duplicate of [How can I dim the screen from Terminal?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/34884/how-can-i-dim-the-screen-from-terminal) <comment361908> To anyone voting to close this as a duplicate of How can I dim the screen from Terminal?, **it is not a duplicate** of  How can I dim the screen from Terminal?! This question is not about setting the brightness level, **it's about disabling "Automatically adjust brightness"  in the System Preferences for the Display**!
