Can I release a new App for iPad 1, as of 2017? <body> I have downloaded old versions of Xcode and macOS so I could develop and test an app on my old 1st-gen iPad device.  I wonder if I can submit a strongnew/strong app which runs on iPad 1 (iOS 5) to Apple App Store as of 2017?  <answer287668> Apple is moving to 64-bit apps on the App Store and any new apps published since 1 February 2015 must support 64-bit. This is also the case for any updates to apps (i.e. they also must be 64-bit compatible).   In other words, any 32-bit only apps submitted to Apple will be rejected.  <answer287674> 32-bit apps will be rejected, but that's not the whole story. Providing the app supports 64-bit, you can provide a 32-bit version alongside in the same app bundle. This way there is a 64-bit version for newer devices/iOS (iOS 11 removes 32-bit app support), but also a 32-bit version for older devices.  To add 32-bit and 64-bit support to your app bundle in Xcode, you need:  ul lito target iOS 5.1.1. Targeting earlier versions of iOS doesn't support the combined app bundles. Later versions of iOS aren't supported on the iPad 1./li lia version of Xcode which is able to target this iOS and also provide the combined bundle functionality, such as Xcode 5.0.2 or 5.0.3./li lito change your project to build both 32-bit and 64-bit. In your project build settings, change Architectures to ‘Standard Architectures (including 64-bit)’./li /ul  You can then build your app to support 32-bit and 64-bit which will successfully submit to iTunes Connect.  <comment363243> Will it be rejected to submit a single binary which supports both 32-bit and 64-bit? ( i'm not sure if it is possible to build an universal app compatible with iOS 5.1~ ) <comment363246> My understanding is that as long as it supports 64-bit it will be fine. So, submitting an app that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit should be okay unless Apple's policy in this regard has changed very recently (but I'm not aware of any such change). If you're a registered developer, you can contact the [Apple Developer Program Support](https://developer.apple.com/contact/phone/) team to double-check on your exact scenario.
