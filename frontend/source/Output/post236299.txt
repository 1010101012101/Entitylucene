Automator/Applescript using Tags <body> I need an strongAutomator/Applescript/strong to move a file to a certain folder based on a specific tag it contains. The eminput/em would be the file. Anybody have any ideas?   TIA, Jake  <answer236412> This should do the trick:  precodeproperty parentfolder : path to home folder set theFiles to choose file default location (POSIX path of parentfolder) with multiple selections allowed repeat with theFile in theFiles     set the_tags to paragraphs of (do shell script "mdls -raw -name kMDItemUserTags " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of theFile &amp; " |sed 's/[()]//g' | tr -d '\\n' | tr -d ' '| tr -d '\"' | sed 's/u\\\\U0308/Ã¼/g'")     if the_tags does not contain "null" then         tell application "Finder"             set parentfolder to folder of theFile as text             if not (((parentfolder as text) &amp; item 1 of the_tags) exists) then                 make new folder at parentfolder with properties {name:item 1 of the_tags}             end if             move theFile to (parentfolder &amp; item 1 of the_tags)         end tell     end if end repeat /code/pre  This Script will move every file with a specific Tag to a folder with the same name as the tag. This can be changed with several if clauses before "move theFile".
