What process is accessing the hard drive? <body> I can hear the hard drive chugging away when it should be idle. Some process is writing/reading from it in semi-random bursts, let's say once every second. Very annoying and wasteful.  I tried activity monitor, but that did not give me enough information and codelsof/code is overwhelming.  Where should I start digging to find out what process is (ab)using the hard drive?   This is on 10.6.6.  <answer6990> I like using codefs_usage/code to see whats going on. A lot of information is going to go by quick, but you usually can see which app is doing stuff. For example, when idle, ill see safari going pretty crazy at times, plus spotlight, etc.  <answer6994> Other thing you can try is the strongcodeiotop/code/strong tool.  Example usage would be  precodesudo iotop     # requires root privileges /code/pre  And more info can be found here  It give summary over the codefs_usage/code which was mentioned by jmlumpkin.  <comment7414> Thanks, fs_usage did the trick!
