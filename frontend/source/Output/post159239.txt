Mac Reset Password Prompt/Script <body> So, I'm setting up Mac's for new users. I create their profile and give a default password (the same one) to each new user.   My question is, when the user goes into the computer for the first time(it could also be a while after) I want them to get a prompt telling them to change their password. How do I do that?  I came across some scripts online for example: pwpolicy -a adminuser -u usertoforcechange -setpolicy "newPasswordRequired=1"  But that gave me too much trouble when testing. The script would work but it was a hassle. When the user was at the Mac login screen, the script prompt would sometimes pop up right away and once the user input the new password it still wouldn't work. It had to be played around with several times for it to work. Ex: putting in the default password then getting the prompt, input new password, but it didn't work...Try that whole thing again THEN it might work.  Then I tried a few other policies. for ex: maxMinutesUntilChangePassword  which I got from here:https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/pwpolicy.8.html  But that didn't work for me. At least newPasswordRequired=1 did work. Anyways, maybe Script is not the answer, but can someone help me make a user, when given a computer, get prompted to change his password? Again it could be after a certain interval of time if it has to. At the very least I would like to remind the user to change his password if a prompt forcing him is not possible.  Thanks for the help, in advanced!  <comment187180> Are these network users or local? <comment187181> @tron_jones Well, they are users on the machine; no network. I create the profile and a hidden Admin account and hand them their computer. <comment187183> How were you trying to run the above script? Login script, launchagent? <comment187187> @tron_jones I ran it with Terminal. just put in the admin account, and then the other users account where "usertoforcechange" is up at the code i posted, and ran it...when i logged out and back in the it would work. <comment187200> Give it a try using a LoginHook or launchAgent and see if that is more consistent. <comment187335> @tron_jones can you point me in a right direction to where I can get info on setting one of these up? Like a good article on how to set up LaunchAgent for example.
