how to add self signed certificate for smtp on iOS <body> I would like to use SMTP server that requires (beside password) also installed certificate. Since it's my private server and I don't have money to spare, that certificate is self-signed.  Without the certificate installed the mail application won't let me complete configuration.  The question is: How do I configure that SMTP server in Apple's mail application on iOS (iPhone, iPad)?
