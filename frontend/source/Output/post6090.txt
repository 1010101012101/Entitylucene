Disable “not ejected properly” warning (as only charging and not writing data) <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Disable &ldquo;the disk was not ejected properly&rdquo; message       Per this blog post (not my blog post) how would you go about disabling the warning popup given that I know I'm not writing data so can't suffer any data loss?  I'd be satisfied with an answer that just disabled this warning across the board, but a more specific solution that could blacklist specific devices, or even better a "smart" way of only showing the popup if data has been written.  <comment6390> Can't be done.  And you should only get the warning if a disk is actually mounted, which leads me to believe you're not "just charging," even though you think you are.  You're still at risk. <comment6391> The disk is mounted, but if no data has been added/removed/etc (at least not any I care about / have asked to be transferred) doesn't that mean I'm not at risk? <comment6392> No.
