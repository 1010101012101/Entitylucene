Different "free space" indications in Macintosh HD after upgrading to El Capitan <body> I wanted to know what was the free available space in my internal HD (I actually have a SSD). In Finder, if I trust the emShow Info/em information (right click or cmd+I on Macintosh HD icon in the Finder sidebar) I get a certain available space. Otherwise, if I just press the spacebar (quick insight), I get a different value, it seems that it's not updated. Finally, also emDisk Utility/em reports a different value.  Why these three different values?  (this gap first appeared after upgrading to El Capitan and trash is already empty).  emAvailable space displayed when clicking codeShow Info/code:/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7iqz.png" alt="Available space when clicking *Show Info*"  emAvailable space displayed when pressing/em kbdspacebar/kbd:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8S1wb.png" alt="Available space when pressing spacebar"  emAvailable space displayed in Disk Utility/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/APnMq.png" alt="Available space displayed in Disk Utility"  <answer239160> I have a solution! You need a clean up spotlight index. Go to Preference - Spotlight - confidentiality. Press "+" and  add whole disk to this. Check it in confidentiality list. After this - remove (by press -)  Turn off you mac. And boot with "safe mode" (by pressing shift + power button, until apple logo will be on display). Please be patient, safe mode loading not fast. And you may have some 'monitor artifacts'.  Check you disk space now. All good? If yes - just reboot again in normal mode.  p.s. this is solution, I got from Apple Care by phone.  <comment261704> I get a third number when I look in Disk Utility <comment261753> @dwightk Yes, you are right. I just updated my post. Three different values.
