How to turnoff screen / lock Macbook Pro with touch bar using keyboard? <body> This was working on older Mac using kbdCtrl/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdPower/kbd. But this doesn't work on the new Macbook Pro 2016 with touch bar. Can someone please help. I want to lock my Mac without putting it to sleep.  <answer261502> you can add the sleep function to the touch bar through system preferences  keyboard  customize control strip and then drag the sleep icon to the touch bar, allowing you to put it to sleep by pressing 1 button.  <answer269222> I would recommend using BetterTouchTool for this. It also includes a lot of other useful features for shortcuts, gestures, touch bar, etc. Once you've started using it, you'll never want to live without.  <answer277899> ol listrongSettings  Keyboard/strong/li li"Expand Control Strip" on touch bar by clicking arrow on the left of the 4th icon from the right of your touch bar./li listrong"Customize Control Strip..." /strong Drag strongScreen Lock/strong somewhere onto the touch bar (of the expanded control strip view)/li listrongSettings  Keyboard  Press Fn key to  Expand Control Strip/strong (assuming you don't use Fn keys)/li liHold kbdfn/kbd and press the "Screen Lock" icon (in any view) to lock your screen!/li /ol  TIP: Put "Screen Lock" on far left (same side as kbdfn/kbd) = lock screen with one hand.  <comment327440> Just found there is a lock button as well which is what i was looking for. Thanks. <comment340699> Well, this is nice, but does anybody know a non-touchbar way to lock it? Accidentally touching the lock button is annoying. <comment341404> @toabi Don't place it in the "default" group; While editing the touchbar, expand it using the '' icon, then place the "Lock Screen" button to the right of "Siri". Now, you lock the screen by expanding without a possibility of getting locked by fat-fingers. The trade-off of course is it's two touches to lock instead of one. <comment341563> And window snapping too! I've been using it for years, it's awesome! <comment349730> @toabi See my new answer below. <comment349767> Haha, jeah that's what I've been doing for a while now too :) It's the best. <comment368093> How does Better Touch Tool help with the lock process? Can you provide an example for how it helps in this specific case? I have it installed and use it primarily for window management, but would like to understand how it supports the screen lock process. <comment373623> @nwinkler Sorry for the late response! BetterTouchTool (BTT) allows you to create your own shortcuts, so I mapped the 'OPT+CMD+L' combination to the 'Lock screen' action. That is exactly what the OP wanted to do: locking his MacBook with his keyboard. <comment373651> Thanks for the update - good one! <comment373836> @TommyKnowlton, Surely there's an out-of-the-box way to lock the computer? <comment374182> Of course: close the lid. Wake-from-sleep triggers require-unlock. But often I don't want it to go to sleep, just to be secure while I walk away (and while it continues the current process). Then, the most accessible method I've found is to place the lock icon on the touch bar.
