Numbers : if then <body> Is it possible to add "if" statement in number (like I would do in AppleScript)  Basically I have A2 and C2 (which are the average of some data),  Now I would like to fill  A3 / C3 based on the value of A2 and C2  For example   if A2 is between 7.50 to anything more I want A3 to be 1br if A2 is between 6.25 and 7.50 I want A3 to be 2br if A2 is between 5.75 and 6.25 I want A3 to be 3br and so on...  Is that possible?  I tried the following but failed.  precodeA2&gt;7.49(A2=1) /code/pre
