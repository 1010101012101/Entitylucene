How to download & install Bonjour Services on a Windows 7 64 bit computer? <body> The Bonjour Service was causing error messages in my event log (Windows 7 laptop).  I have deleted it and the Bonjour Print Service.    I now need to re-install it.  Where do I download it and how do I install it on a Windows 7 (64 bit) laptop?  <answer214202> You can download Bonjour for Windows from Apple's Bonjour support pages.  Bonjour for Windows is bundled with Bonjour Print Services for Windows:     Bonjour Print Services for Windows lets you discover and configure Bonjour-enabled printers from your Windows computer using the Bonjour Printer Wizard.
