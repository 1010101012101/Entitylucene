Are Trådfri motion detectors, dimmers, and switch compatible with HomeKit? <body> Today Ikea announced HomeKit compatibility for their Trådfri line of smart lighting. I assume the bulbs show as accessories in HomeKit but do the motion detectors, dimmers, and switches show up as well?  <answer294829> To see what's currently compatible with HomeKit have a look at HomeKit accessories. The list keeps getting smarter,, at Apple's website.  At the present time, nothing from Ikea is compatible and will not be until later this year in the fall, starting with Ikea's Trådfri line of smart lighting. Explicit compatibility of any other Ikea products has yet to be announced.
