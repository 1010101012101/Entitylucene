How can I avoid notes to be deleted from the iPhone when I delete them on my Mac Email app? <body> Since the last software update on my iPhone 3 all the notes that I writte on the iPhone appears in the mail.app on my mac as income mails.   When I delete the notes at the Mail.app, they are also deleted at the iPhone.   Do you know how to avoid the notes to be deleted?  Thanks!  <answer37060> Turn off notes sync in Settings - Mail,Calender,Contacts - select your account and then turn off notes sync.  In Mail if you hit command + comma you can also stop showing notes in the inbox.  <answer37061> When you connect your iPhone, you should have the option in iTunes to turn off the syncing of your Notes.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4191  <answer217802> ul liGo to Preferences in Mail.app on your iMac/li liGo to account/li liThen, click account that notes hooked in/li liSee, the show notes in inbox/li liUnchecked it/li /ul  Good luck :D
