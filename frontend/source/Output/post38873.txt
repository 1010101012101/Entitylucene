Are there alternate OSes for the click-wheel iPods? <body> The firmware on the click-wheel iPod is very simple and doesn't have a lot of "extra" features. It also doesn't allow you to drop music on it; it has to go through iTunes. Are there alternate OSes for the click-wheel iPods?  <answer38875> An alternate OS is Rockbox. It is a free firmware replacement that works on many music players. Rockbox supports:     iPod 1g through 5.5g, iPod Mini, iPod Nano 1g and iPod Nano 2g   One downside to Rockbox is that you have to make your iPod a Windows formatted partition on a Windows computer.  There are many different themes for Rockbox. Here's an example of just one:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6I7GL.png" alt="Rockbox Karma"  <comment44012> If you downvote, ***please*** comment and tell why you downvoted!!
