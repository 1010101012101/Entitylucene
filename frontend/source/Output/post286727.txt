is this a stolen phone <body> I happened to have stumbled upon an IPhone 5c that is on 'Find My Phone' saw a sim card inside from Lycamobile with serial number 8944260907010065854 and discovered it was locked. Since I can't open it how do I get the email or contact of the owner so that i can either send it back or open it, thanks.   <comment361874> Just give it to the police or take it to an Apple store.
