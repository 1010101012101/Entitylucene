Shortcut Keys do not work any more <body> Previously when editing the information about a song, you could press Alt+G to go to the Genre, or Alt+A to the artist.  This seems to not work in the latest iTunes 12.  Is there a way to get the shortcut keys back?  <answer151132> Looks like that feature has been taken off.br While not exactly the answer, CMD-I shows information about the selected song or disk. A workaround could be sort by Artist or Genre  <comment177813> Help  Keyboard shortcuts might work <comment237187> IMO, that was a ridiculous decision to take away shortcuts. Very irritating
