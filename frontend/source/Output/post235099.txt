Reformatting disk with no partition map <body> I have a 250GB hard drive that I tried to "burn" an ISO to (to make it bootable). Something went terribly wrong.This is what the disk looks like in Disk Utility (unmounted).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/udwnX.png" alt="Unmounted"  When I mount it, this happens.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tyd5h.png" alt="Mounted"  I have tried formatting, erasing, verifying, and repairing the disk through Disk Utility and terminal's diskutil command, all to no avail. I have tried deleting the files contained on this hard drive (Windows boot folders/executables) using both the GUI and a sudo command in terminal with no luck. This is a partial output of codediskutil list/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2WeXT.png" alt="diskutil list"  The drive is code/dev/disk4/code.  I consider myself decently knowledgable in technology in general, but this problem has been very difficult. Can someone please help me? Please feel free to leave any questions or comments below.  <answer235101> Remove all external disks (just for safety reasons). If possible also remove all internal disks except the boot disk or "refresh" your backups.  The proposed command (codedd/code) used improperly can be deadly for your data.  Open Terminal.app and get the disk identifier of the disk containing the DVD partition:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  Unmount the disk:  precode#replace diskX by the disk identifier of the "DVD disk" you found previously diskutil umountDisk /dev/diskX /code/pre  Overwrite the first sectors of the disk with  precodesudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/diskX bs=4096 count=8 /code/pre  This will zero the first 8 physical blocks (or 8 4k/64 512b logical blocks) of the partition and should remove any "DVD hints".  Open emDisk Utility/em and try to erase/repartition the disk again.  <comment287499> Thank you! I don't have time to try this this weekend, but I will try it sometime soonish (hopefully Monday) and see how it goes. <comment287500> @NoahL, While klanomath said "_Remove all external disks (just for safety reasons)._" and I don't disagree with that, however your system is showing 5 internal disks, so considering how destructive `dd` can be... while your disconnected external disks are safe from a mistake with `dd`, your internal disks are not! Make **absolutely** sure the `dd` command line is not malformed in that the `of=` _option_ is **absolutely pointing to the correct disk before executing the command!**  Seriously, double and triple check your command line is accurate before executing! <comment287501> @user3439894 It's a tower Mac Pro so I'll remove internal disks as well. I do regular backups and I'll only leave my startup disk in. Thanks for your concern :) <comment287503> @NoahL Even if you hit the wrong disk (but using  **bs=4096 count=8**) everything can be recovered with ease because all sizes (gpt/efi) are standardized and the (single) data partition won't be affected. With two data partitions (like the system partition & Recovery HD) it's slighlty more difficult. <comment287507> Recovery from a mistaken dd can be made easier by first doing `dd if=/dev/diskX of=/path/to/backup bs=4096 count=8` ... then even if you destroy the partition table on the wrong disk, you can recover it from the backup (by copying it back). I would do that twice, to two separate disksâ€”that way, even if you accidentally hit your backup disk, you can grab the file from the other disk. (BTW: `count` is essential; without it, it will zero the entire disk) <comment294640> This worked, but I had to erase to JFHS+ using terminal. Erasing to ExFAT didn't work.
