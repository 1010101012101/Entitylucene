Shift+C no longer working <body> I am not sure why and quite saddened by this but I can no longer type a capital 'C' on my keyboard for my Mac mini running OS X Yosemite. I have run through all of the shortcuts in emSystem Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts/em, but kbdShift/kbd+kbdC/kbd is not listed there, anywhere...  What is causing this, and how to fix it?  <answer207746> First of all make sure your keyboard is working properly. That would be a great first step in figuring out if there is a problem with the hardware. If it is not your keyboard, then I would try to turn of your Mac and turn it back on. If the problem still persists, then you would actually have to add a shortcut yourself   ul liChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Keyboard./li liClick Shortcuts, select App Shortcuts, then click Add (+)./li liClick the Application pop-up menu, then choose an app. If you want to set the same key combination for a menu command that appears in many apps, choose All Applications./li liIf the app you want to select doesn’t appear in the list, choose Other, then locate it using the Open dialog. Some apps may not allow you to set keyboard shortcuts./li liType the menu command for which you want to set a keyboard shortcut in the Menu Title field./li liYou must type the command exactly as it appears in the Application menu, including ellipses and any other punctuation. To type an ellipsis, use three periods without spaces./li liClick in the Keyboard Shortcut field, press the key combination that you want to assign to the menu command, then click Add (+)./li liYou can’t use each type of key (for example, a letter key) more than once in a key combination./li liQuit and restart any apps you’re using for the new keyboard shortcut to take effect./li liIf you assign a keyboard shortcut that already exists for another command or another app, your new shortcut won’t work. Find the menu command that’s using it, then reassign the keyboard shortcut for that item./li liTo remove a customized shortcut, click Delete (–)./li /ul  <answer207754> Have you taken that keyboard to another computer or tried another keyboard on the Mac Mini?   The most elegant solution to your problem would be if it's a hardware issue on that specific keyboard.   <answer238774> I had the same issue it was because i had SHIFT-C bound to toggle mute in skype  <comment250645> And for context, the (5) capitalized C's above were entered with Cap Locks! XX( <comment250649> Have you take that keyboard to another conputer or tried another keyboard on the Mac Mini? My suspicion is a hardware failure is causing this. <comment250656> I would make the short cut like this= <comment250660> Oh.. My... Goodness - it was just the keyboard!!!! This fixed it, I just swapped. Thank you bmike!!!! Please toss this in as a formal question answer so I can mark as 'solved' :) <comment250662> How does this address the problem of a non-working "Shift-C" key combination? <comment250666> @patrix He can add his own combination such as CAPS-C-CAPS to SHIFT-C to address the problem of a nonworking shift c comination <comment250667> Using CAPS instead of Shift doesn't need any shortcuts at all. Shortcuts are used to access menu commands, not standard letters.
