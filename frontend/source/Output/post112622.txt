Time Capsule showing monitor icon in Finder sidebar <body> Normally my Time Capsule is seen in the Finder sidebar under "Shared" with an icon of a disk drive by the name of the Time Capsule. Now it keeps showing a monitor icon by the name of the Time Capsule, and when I click on it, it will change back to the disk drive icon.  I don't see any problems when I open Airport Utility and check the Time Capsule setup.  Anyone know why this is happening?  supI'm using Mavericks, and a 3suprd/sup-gen Time Capsule/sup  <answer147256> That's one of the bugs which Mavericks 10.9.4 has. So you can't do anything beside waiting and hoping, that apple will fix this issue in a future update. (by c0dev)  <answer151923> Also I have this problem in codeOS 10.10 Yosemite/code and it's continues to give me the inconvenience, so I googled till I find the answer. Finally, I'm trying to do this: make sure that the TC is not mounted (or dismount it). Then  in finder menu use codeGo -&gt; Connect to Server/code. Type codeAFP://TCnetworkname/code or codeIPaddress/code (replace with the real IP or real network name). When the computer finds the TC, you need to give a password (public for default) type in your password if you changed it or public if not, then save it in your keychain. That's it.
