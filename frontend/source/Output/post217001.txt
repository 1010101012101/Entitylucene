Spotify battery usage <body> I've got an iPhone 6 (upgraded from an iPhone 5s two weeks ago) and the battery life is irritating me.  I use Spotify a lot (probably 5 hours+ a day whilst I'm at college, easily) but I think it might be draining my battery excessively. I've attached the battery usage screenshots, why on earth is it using so much battery? It lasts exactly as long as my year old 5s did with the same usage (7am-6pm). I restored my new iPhone 6 from a backup of the 5s, if that makes a difference. All of my music is offline and I don't do much else on the phone. Also, background app refresh is switched off entirely, why would the app be doing "background activity"?  A friend with an iPhone 6 also uses Spotify heavily and his phone's currently on 75% after charging it this morning. Mine's on 15% (and dropping fast) in power save mode. It never used to drain like this - I can remember my old 5s used to last from 7am-10pm at one point with iOS 9 and Spotify. I've rolled back the app, updated it to the latest version and reinstalled it but it doesn't make a difference. Any ideas?
