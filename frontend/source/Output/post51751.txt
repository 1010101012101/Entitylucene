Operating System Not Found from bootable USB? <body> Hi I am trying to create a bootable USB for Windows 7 (I have superdrive removed). I went the rEFIt +  Microsoft Bootable USB Tool route and keep getting  "Operating System Not Found".  I also checked the USB in Disk Utils and it shows as MBR.  USB also shows up if I press "Alt" when booting, but same "Operating system..." error.  How can I fix this?  Spent half a day already...  <comment59151> From the fact that you say "I have superdrive removed" I'm guessing you're using a Mac, but that isn't clear from your post. Are you? <comment59153> Yes I am, Macbook Pro.. <comment59154> Do you know if your USB of Windows 7 (install DVD?) works? Have you successfully used it on another computer? Or is the question about your bootable USB? <comment59155> I used it before, in my superdrive days... <comment59156> Used the DVD to boot via the superdrive or this USB with Windows 7? <comment59157> used to boot via superdrive - burnt that onto a DVD and installed Win <comment59159> How did you create the USB you want to boot from? <comment59160> Microsoft USB DVD Download Tool.. <comment59162> Is this the tool you used: [Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool)? Please verify the link points to the correct site. <comment59163> yes this one exactly.. it actually looks like it's not possible at all to install win7 from USB onto a macbook pro.. unless I do the virtual to physical thing.. <comment63831> I'm also having this problem. I've tried rEFIt with a USB drive created with Microsoft's tool, and I also tried using Bootcamp's tool to burn the ISO file by editing the info.plist file so that I had the option. In both cases it fails to boot from the USB stick. Also fails if I try it with a Freecom USB DVD drive with the original Windows 7 DVD in the drive which just results in a flashing _ on a black screen. Considering buying an external superdrive to see if I that works.
