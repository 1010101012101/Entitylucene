Xcode: TAB key for indenting selection <body> I hope that somebody here can suggest me a way to make the kbdTAB/kbd key indent a text selection (i.e., could be multi-line and not just one line) in Xcode.  In Xcode preferences, I set kbdTAB/kbd as the shortcut for the "Shift right" function but it does not work: instead of indenting, it deletes the text.  Thank you in advance for your help.  <answer167476> You can use strongBetterTouchTool/strong to rebind kbdTAB ⇥/kbd key to kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd]/kbd only for Xcode.app. BetterTouchTool can be downloaded here. This is how this should look like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iauf1.png" alt="enter image description here" I've tested this and it works for me.  <comment196364> Thanks, it works. However, it requires BetterTouchTool to run in background. I hope there is a lighter solution.
