Mac computer glitches and then freezes whenever I use any app from adobe creative cloud <body> I really need someone to help me out regarding an issue I’ve been having on my Mac.  The issue started about a month ago when I had photoshop open. I was using an old version of google earth, and then all of a sudden, this starts happening:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IbrhM.png" alt="enter image description here"  Later, whenever I tried to zoom out on photoshop, these weird repetitive squares kept appearing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l8XrE.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then in safari, these glitchy colors appeared:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sVn90.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then today flashing black lines appeared on illustrator:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nM9qD.png" alt="enter image description here"  The glitching got so bad over this past month, that my computer used to freeze up every 5 minutes of using InDesign.  Things to know about the problem:  ul liGlitching would start followed by my computer freezing up and then me having to restart./li liI have a lot of space left on my computer but once when these applications started glitching, I checked to see how much space I had and it went down to 0./li liGlitches only occur when I have any app from adobe creative cloud open./li /ul  Things I’ve done:  ul liRestarted computer/li liChecked to see if there is enough space on my computer/li liRe-installed operating system/li liTalked with people from Adobe/li /ul  I still have no idea whether this is a software issue or hardware issue. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!  <comment359252> What kind/model of Mac to you have, with how much RAM? What kind of space are you referring to, disk space or RAM? Can you add a screenshot of Activity Monitor showing RAM usage when the applications start glitschig? <comment359313> I'd switch off hardware acceleration/WebGL in CC & browsers, then enable one at a time to see if it's one or both that need to be on to cause the error. Photoshop will crash badly if it runs out of video RAM it thinks it ought to own [might be fixed in 2017, not fully tested yet, but 2015 & 15.5 were both bad for that.] <comment359347> @patrix I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) with 16 GB RAM. I meant I checked to see if I had disk space, and I have 100 GB free out of 250 GB. I tried to get a screenshot of the Activity Monitor RAM but couldn't reproduce the crash with it open. <comment359349> @Tetsujin I turned off "GPU performance" for Illustrator and InDesign, and I turned off "use graphic processor to accelerate computation" on Photoshop. Since the crashes happen really irregularly and are hard to reproduce, it might take a really long time to try turning them off one at a time.
