El Capitan Realtek 8812au Installation stuck at "Destination Select" <body> I'm trying to install driver for my D-Link DW-182 rev. C1 which uses RTL-8812AU Realtek chipset and supports Mac OS X via this ftp link. ( ver. 2.3.1 )  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZBLcp.png" alt="Destination Select"  What's the problem? Any help?br At least can I unpack it and install it manually?  <answer224585> I've a ticket with D-Link Egypt and here's their reply:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QvLao.png" alt="Dlink Egypt" strongSimply/strong it's working :)     <comment263430> This may or may not be something you already triedâ€¦ Even though it's already highlighted, that particular installer type needs for you to actually click on the destination [even if there's only one possibility] before Continue will un-grey. <comment263432> Having said that, it doesn't work for me either. It doesn't claim to support 10.11, though, only up to 10.10. <comment263509> @Tetsujin then how to unpack it, it should have drivers and utilities inside, do you try to manually install it? <comment263513> I had no desire to actually install it, just to test the install destination. You might find something like [Pacifist](https://www.charlessoft.com) could do it
