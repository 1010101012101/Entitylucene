Automator quarantine Gatekeeper workaround? <body> I am using my Developer certificate to sign Automator Apps via the Export dialogue, however when distributing these apps (outside the Mac App store) via email, Gatekeeper still flags my apps as a from an unknown developer. I gather from the Apple Developer forums that non-App store apps are tagged with a quarantine of some sort.  I am hoping to see if someone else has encountered a similar issue and found a workaround. Perhaps an Applescript I can add to my workflow that will remove that quarantine?  <answer121605> h1Signature Check/h1  Check your Automator application is being signed correctly. Do this using the command line tool codecodesign/code. Use the following command in strongTerminal.app/strong to view the code signature associated with your application:  precodecodesign -d -vvvv /Applications/MyGreatAutomator.app /code/pre  Does the output mention your developer identifier? If not, revisit how you sign your application as it may be broken.  h2Quarantine Flag/h2  The quarantine flag is applied to files downloaded from the Internet. This flag can be manually removed using this command:  precodexattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MyGreatAutomator.app /code/pre
