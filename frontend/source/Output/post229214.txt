Ethernet not working on MacBook pro retina 13 <body> My Ethernet connection is not working on my computer (mid 2015).   I already rebooted, deleting the files "NetworkInterfaces.plist" and "preferences.plist" into the folder "/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration". I opened a terminal window, giving this command  precodesudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder; say DNS cache flushed /code/pre  and then I rebooted again.  But nothing seems to work.  Any idea?  Here I give the system information screen, it is Italian, sorry for this. However it says no ethernet driver is installed (could the issue be with this?) and the Thunderbolt tab says "no device connected" also when the ethernet adapter is there. I also tried to connect a VGA adaptor in order to connect a monitor and this works, so it is not the thunderbolt port.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/INtjO.png" alt="System information gives this (sorry, it&#39;s Italian). It says that no driver is installed and in Thunderbolt section, it says no device is connected, which is of course not true."  <answer229217> If this is recent, you may be the victim of a bad malware protection update from Apple. They have posted a support article explaining how to check if this was the cause, and how to fix it.     strongFirst, check your version number/strong      ol   liWhile pressing the Option key, choose System Information from the   Apple menu.  /li   liExpand the Software section and select Installations./li   liClick the Software Name column header to sort the list   alphabetically./li   liLook for “Incompatible Kernel Extension   Configuration Data.” If the most recent version installed is 3.28.1,   follow the steps below./li   /ol      strongIf you can connect to Wi-Fi, follow these steps to update to version 3.28.2/strong      ol   liOpen the Terminal app./li   liEnter this command to update to the current version of the “Incompatible Kernel Extension Configuration Data” kernel extension:    codesudo softwareupdate --background/code/li   liQuit Terminal and restart your Mac. /li   /ol      strongIf you can't connect to Wi-Fi, follow these steps to update to version 3.28.2/strong      ol   liRestart from OS X Recovery by holding down Command-R while your Mac starts up./li   liSelect Disk Utility from the list of OS X Utilities./li   liSelect your drive from the list of internal drives in the sidebar.

You can reinstall OS X on your drive without reformatting it.   <comment279566> P.s.: I also reset the VRAM multiple times. As expected it did not work <comment279568> Have you tried checking the Console? I think http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/229103/how-can-i-troubleshoot-or-reset-a-thunderbolt-ethernet-adapter might be of help here. <comment279571> Hello, sorry, how do I check the console? Command : is this the command?  system_profiler | grep Network <comment279576> UPDATE: I solved the issue, thanks to the question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/229103/how-can-i-troubleshoot-or-reset-a-thunderbolt-ethernet-adapter as advised by @perhapsmaybeharry Thanks. It was some further network configuration file in "/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration", in "/Library/Preferences" and in "~/Library/Preferences" <comment279616> Please put the information from the link in the answer just in case it is ever deleted. <comment279617> Will do when back at a laptop... it's too long and requires too much reformatting to do from here. <comment279618> @Oscar, you may want to post your last comment as an answer and then mark it as solved.
