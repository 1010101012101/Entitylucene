Sudo works for a whole day and then stops working until a reboot <body> I currently have admin access to a Macbook Pro running OSX 10.8.4.  I have been sudoing at the terminal for the whole day with no restart until sudo stops working.  I rebooted the operating system and it is working again.  Is there a configuration that is preventing sudo from working after certain number of hours?  My codesudoers/code file has with username codetheuser/code:  precodeDefaults    env_reset Defaults    env_keep += "BLOCKSIZE" Defaults    env_keep += "COLORFGBG COLORTERM" Defaults    env_keep += "__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING" Defaults    env_keep += "CHARSET LANG LANGUAGE LC_ALL LC_COLLATE LC_CTYPE" Defaults    env_keep += "LC_MESSAGES LC_MONETARY LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME" Defaults    env_keep += "LINES COLUMNS" Defaults    env_keep += "LSCOLORS" Defaults    env_keep += "SSH_AUTH_SOCK" Defaults    env_keep += "TZ" Defaults    env_keep += "DISPLAY XAUTHORIZATION XAUTHORITY" Defaults    env_keep += "EDITOR VISUAL" Defaults:theuser timestamp_timeout=30  # Runas alias specification  # User privilege specification root    ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  strongEDIT/strong  The issue is happening again and after tailing code/var/log/system.log/code, I see the following message:  precodefailed to create secure channel: STATUS_NO_TRUST_SAM_ACCOUNT (0xC000018B) /code/pre  Any idea what the above might mean?  <comment114728> What does "stop working" mean: error message, just doesn't change user or what? Also: what is in the logs? <comment114732> Stops working is when I sudo and enter the password, it asks me to try again.  What is the location of the logs for sudoing? <comment114744> You should check the sudo log (syslog). You can do this using the Console app (found in /Applications/Utilities
