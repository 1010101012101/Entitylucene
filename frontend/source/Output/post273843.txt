iCloud drive - keep documents but remove desktop? <body> Very often I copy large video files to desktop for processing, editing, etc... Too bad it is using a lot of bandwidth and slows down other uploads.  I want to use iCloud drive, but I want to disable Desktop. Is there a way of doing exactly that?  hr  Symmetrical question: Sync only Desktop folder, but not Documents, with &quot;Store in iCloud&quot;? (iCloud Drive)  Some related support thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7679836?start=0&amp;tstart=0  System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xIYc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment344245> Can't you simply store your large video files in a different folder, one that you don't sync to iCloud? <comment344247> ```desktop``` is a convenient location because it is ```desktop```. It is easier to dump files there, without thinking too much. <comment344249> I did a little research and can't find how to disconnect `desktop` from `documents`.  Maybe someone else here will know how to do that.  While waiting for a better answer, at least you have a workaround. <comment344250> Hahaha... Of course not putting files to desktop is a workaround but it is not convenient. Dragging files from SD card or anything really directly to desktop is much more convenient :) <comment344361> Couldn't you just reverse the answer to the ["symmetrical question" you linked](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/253647)? Uncheck the "Desktop & Documents Folders" option, then move `Documents` to the `Library/Mobile Documents` directory (which still gets synced because the per-app directories all live there) and symlink that to where `Documents` originally was. Granted, that answer is unconfirmed, but to my knowledge it should work.
