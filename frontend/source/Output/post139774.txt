Is there a way to stop Bluetooth coming back on after an update <body> When i do an update via the Settings app on the iPhone (because the computer i sync to iTune doesn't connect to the net) after the update is done Bluetooth is turned back on. because Updates can be months apart i keep forgetting this so when it comes back on i forget Bluetooth is turned back on and thus end up it having chew up more power.  Is there a way i can prevent the iPhone from turning on Bluetooth after an update?  <answer139779> Apple does this, maybe for information-gathering such as their iBeacon stuff. There's not much you can do about this behavior and because I've not jailbroken my iPhone I cannot confirm whether jailbreaking your device will prevent this behavior.
