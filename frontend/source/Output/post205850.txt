They emshould/em connect without step three but it doesn't hurt to force the headphone to go looking for the phone./li /ol  <comment248236> Yeah it works. It indeed automatically search and be connected with my phone. <comment373108> Quick note: don't switch on the headphones and keep holding down the power button for pairing mode. That's for *new* pairings. Just power on, play button. Ten minutes of my life I'll never get back.
