Why does my screen have horizontal fine lines through it when i disable the discreet graphics card on my macbook pro 2011 <body> My macbook pro late 2011 i7 2.2GHz was getting stuck on a white screen after a short time displaying the apple logo and progress wheel instead of booting normally. The only way I could get any sort of boot was to use single user mode but had tried everything to try to diagnose the root cause and still could not start OS X desktop until I found the very helpful tip on how to disable discrete graphics card and use only integrated graphics. I followed the instructions and now I can use almost use it normally except that the screen quality is pale and awful and I have fine horizontal lines running through it. Does anyone know why, or if there's something else wrong with my macbook apart from the graphics card?  <comment314204> Did you check https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/ to see if you're affected?
