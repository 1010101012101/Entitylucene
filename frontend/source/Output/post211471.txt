Recent items menus have stopped working on my iMac <body> Recently I noticed that on my iMac, running El Capitan, the Open Recent menu has stopped getting updated, both in the Apple menus, and for apps, and both for the Open Recent menu item, and the list that pops up from the Dock.   I checked in System Preferences | General | Recent Items, and it is saying None. I have tried a number of times to reset it to 20, but it shows up as None when I get back in to System Preferences.  I hope someone can help me sort this problem out.  <answer212254> I've had the same thing happen within applications but in my finder recent items my shows multiple duplicates of the same recent item and seems to add one every time I open the app again. I tried to screen shot the recent items but of course if you try to hit shift-command-4 it changes the recent items to "show XXXX in finder" because you have held down the command. The favorites are also gone from the dialog boxes. smh what in the F is going on with Apple's dev and QA department in the last few years?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bNqI.png" alt="app recent items"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/18jZd.png" alt="finder recent items"  <answer212541> go to "system preferences"  "general"  "recent items" el capitan reset this to zero for some reason set it to whatever list length you like, and it will start working again  <answer212542> Workaround  For the Recently Used Application list in the Dock, try the following:  ol liOpen Finder, File  New Smart Folder/li liPress + button next to Save/li liSelect "Kind" is "Application"/li liPress + button Select "Last opened date" is "this week"/li liClick Save and check "Add to sidebar"/li liOn the sidebar, right click the created Smart Folder and click "Add to Dock"/li /ol  <answer215263> For me, this empartially/em fixed things:  ol liClose all open apps./li liMove ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.recentitems.plist (and ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.recentitems.plist.lockfile if it exists) to a backup directory./li liReboot./li /ol  In my case this fixed the recent items lists under the File menu in each app and the Apple menu. But the context menus on Dock icons still do not update.  <answer220287> same issue for me since the el capitan updates- recent item pref keeps resetting to zero after a restart.  And when it is working, I am getting multiple copies of the same file listed in recent.  Sounds like an OS problem that will probably be resolved in a future update (all updates are beta these days).  <answer224790> As a work-around use TinkerTool to set your "Recent Items" to which-ever value you like.  So far it seems to behave as expected…  <answer230186> The solution is way more simple. Go to System Preferences. General. Recent items: choose between none to 50.  emThen restart your computer/em  <answer230873> Open recently used items: Choose Apple menu  Recent Items. You see the apps, documents, and servers that you recently used. For some apps, you can also see the documents you recently worked on. To change the number of items you see in the menu, choose Apple menu  System Preferences, click General, then click the “Recent items” pop-up menu and choose a number.  <answer232022> The following worked for me!br Tried all of the previous answers, but none worked.br Then I came across a fix described here on Apple Forums:    First round (tried, but did not work for me):  Open terminal, and type:  precodesudo find ~ $TMPDIR.. \          -exec chflags -h nosappnd,noschg,nosunlnk,nouappnd,nouchg,nouunlnk {} + \          -exec chown -h $UID {} + -exec chmod +rw {} + \          -exec chmod -h -N {} + -type d -exec chmod -h +x {} + 2&gt;&amp;- /code/pre  Second round (this one did work for me):  ul liStart up in Recovery mode./li liIn recovery mode, launch terminal (from utilities menu)/li liType coderesetpassword/code and hit enter (no worries)/li liSelect your startup volume/li liSelect relevant user/li liAt the bottom, under Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs, click Reset/li liI repeated the last to steps for all users + root/li liRestart your computer/li /ul  The description on Apple Forums is really clear, so if in doubt, go there. Hopefully it will help others too.  FYI: All my recent items were gone in all apps, in Apple menu the whole menu item was even gone, and changing in System Preferences from none to whatever kept reverting back to none.br I am on a MacBook Air (early 2014), running El Capitan 10.11.3  <answer246055> I ran into this today on a month-old iMac. The only thing that isn't fresh about it is my account, which has been replicated across 5 machines and 12 major MacOS versions using Migration Assistant when possible, leaving it with a fair bit of cruft in ~/Library/Preferences/. Unfortunately, in recent versions Apple has made it complicated to clean up that directory effectively by trashing files because codecfprefsd/code manages the emreal/em preference info and you need to talk nicely to it with the codedefaults/code utility.   Anyway, I fond that every time I tried to change the preference I got a sequence of log entries like this:  precodeJul 14 18:14:03 extravagant sharedfilelistd[411] &lt;Critical&gt;: [default] [&lt;CFString 0x7fff77ea0e00 [0x7fff77f58440]&gt;{contents = "com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentApplications"}] List write failed invalid info items: (null) properties: (null) Jul 14 18:14:03 extravagant sharedfilelistd[411] &lt;Error&gt;: -[ListStore writeListItems:properties:withListIdentifier:notificationHander:] [com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentApplications] List write failed invalid info items: (null) properties: (null) Jul 14 18:14:05 extravagant com.apple.preference.general.remoteservice[85562] &lt;Warning&gt;: Error getting number of recent items of type 2, LSSharedFileListCopyProperty returned NULL Jul 14 18:14:11 extravagant com.apple.preference.general.remoteservice[85562] &lt;Warning&gt;: New number of recents: 30 Jul 14 18:14:11 extravagant com.apple.preference.general.remoteservice[85562] &lt;Warning&gt;: Error getting number of recent items of type 1, LSSharedFileListCopyProperty returned NULL Jul 14 18:14:11 extravagant com.apple.preference.general.remoteservice[85562] &lt;Warning&gt;: Error getting number of recent items of type 2, LSSharedFileListCopyProperty returned NULL Jul 14 18:14:11 extravagant com.apple.preference.general.remoteservice[85562] &lt;Warning&gt;: Error getting number of recent items of type 3, LSSharedFileListCopyProperty returned NULL Jul 14 18:14:13 extravagant com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.preference.general.remoteservice[85562]) &lt;Notice&gt;: Service exited due to signal: Killed: 9 /code/pre  Also, both codedefaults domains/code and a few dozen files in Preferences told me that most applications with a proper defaults domain like strongcom.example.appname/strong emalso/em had a defaults domain like strongcom.example.appname.LSSharedFileList/strong which contained lists of recently used files. Except emthey weren't recently used files at all./em None of the *.LSSharedFileList.plist files had changed since my migration from my old Yosemite machine, and neither had com.apple.recentitems.plist. So I cleaned house by running these commands inside ~/Library/Preferences/:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.recentitems rm com.apple.recentitems.plist* /code/pre  The codedefaults/code command  tells codecfprefsd/code to remove all of the settings in that domain, which leaves a 42-byte logically empty .plist file and a 0-byte .plist.lockfile file which the coderm/code command removes.  precodedefaults find LSSharedFileList |grep 'keys in domain .*LSShared'|cut -d"'" -f2 |xargs -L1 defaults delete rm  *LSSharedFileList.plist* /code/pre  Less obvious, but essentially the same thing for all codedefaults/code domains with strongLSSharedFileList/strong in their names  precodefind . -name "*.plist" -print0 |xargs -0 -L1 plutil -lint |grep -v ': OK$'|cut -d: -f1|sed 's/.*/"&amp;"/' |xargs rm /code/pre  Even less obvious, but apparently crucial. This pipeline finds all of the *.plist files in the current directory (which was ~/Library/Preferences/,) checks each one for validity with codeplutil -lint/code, parses out the filenames of those that are not "OK", enquotes them to protect from embedded spaces and the like, and removes them all. In my case the invalid *.plist files were all 0-byte antique files for stuff that can't run on El Cap anyway, so I was sure I was not deleting any actual information. strongemYMMV!!/em/strong  precodefind . -size 42c -name "*plist" -delete /code/pre  This swept out any *.plist files that were 42-bytes long, the size of a logically empty plist in binary format. I had a few of those hanging around and they emmight/em have been causing the complaint from codesharedfilelistd/code.  precodekillall sharedfilelistd /code/pre  That terminated the instance of codesharedfilelistd/code running under my account. The system restarted a fresh instance automatically. I'm not sure this was needed, but it seemed prudent since I had just wiped out a bunch of information from the preferences subsystem that was related to the old way of doing what codesharedfilelistd/code apparently does in El Cap.   strongemNOTE: Those 7 commands are the abridged version of what I did that made sense and had effects, scattered across 3 hours of poking around and testing and trying to find info on codesharedfilelistd/code to no avail./em/strong   It is also worth noting that there's no codesudo/code involved here, because I was in my own ~/Library/Preferences/, manipulating my own preferences realm. The Recent Items menu and hence its settings are user-specific so wherever that setting is stored (never worked that out...) has to be user-specific as well, not something requiring root to fix. There's a prior response that includes an unexplained massive permission/ACL/flag wipe, run with sudo, that didn't even work for the author, and may cause serious systemic harm. This is nothing like that. Also note that it does not require logging out, rebooting, booting in Recovery Mode, or doing anything else likely to be disruptive.   <comment256627> From the question: "I checked in System Preferences | General | Recent Items, and it is saying None. I have tried a number of times to reset it to 20, but it shows up as None when I get back in to System Preferences." <comment258145> I have the exact same issue. Any solutions? <comment258344> I filed a radar bug report to apple. Radar Bug #23370920. Let's wait what they answer. <comment262908> While useful information, this material is not appropriate as an Answer on a Stack Exchange. The idea of SE is a specific Answer to a narrowly-focused Question. This post furthers a discussion but does not directly provide a solution to the Question. And this is a tangent, as the Question is about a setting not sticking in System Presences. The issue here may or may not be directly related. I would suggest posting as your own Question, but coincidentally I already did post the same,  [Disappearing "Recent Items" menu item](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/215616/17907). <comment262909> To help with the screen shot problem, use the [Grab app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_(software)) bundled with Mac OS X. Use the `Timed Screen` feature. <comment265673> Same thing happens to me; I can't change this from "None." <comment265959> I wait for update 3 months and nothing.  <comment266611> Welcome to Ask Different!

I use Dropbox and that's what happened to me; 50,000 files started syncing.  You may want to do specific folders instead of just home (~). <comment301105> Seriously Apple - WTF? <comment303322> That *should* work, but the whole problem is that it is not uncommon to damage your preferences badly enough that it does not work. <comment303330> That  'sudo' horror ***which you say didn't work for you*** blindly removes every flavor of protection from a significant collection of files and directories. It *may* open vulnerabilities that one would not normally have. <comment310611> On my system, just running `killall sharedfilelistd` alone seems to do the trick perfectly!  (I'm definitely in a different situation though: I don't have an old migrated profile, this problem seems to start happening at random, rebooting makes it go away for a while). <comment311213> This should be selected answer, it works great <comment313720> In my case I had Apple menu  System Preferences  General “Recent items” set to 0. Just changed the value and that's it. <comment323916> Worked great when none of the other solutions worked— my recent documents were even restored after running these commands.  <comment343202> This worked for me - thanks!
