Bootcamp - is it OK to delete windowssupport.dmg after installing windows? <body> As the title says, I've already installed Windows by bootcamp and all works well. Now I've found this windowssupport.dmg in Macintosh HD/Library/Application Support/Bootcamp. Can I just delete it? I'm low on disk space.  <answer171784> Yes, you can.  strongwindowssupport.dmg/strong is a large but disposable file. System requires it once when you installing Windows. After that you've got no reason to keep it at your drive.  <comment202159> Thanks. Could you point me to a source that explains it or briefly explain how are you sure that's the case.
