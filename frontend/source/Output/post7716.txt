How do I create HTML emails on Mac? <body> I'd like to know the best way to create gorgeous mail templates such as Jumsfot's Stationary Mail ones and send them without having to use Safari. Is there a way to do this easily?  <answer7728> I've tried this once, when Apple discontinued the iCards, but I wasn't able to do anything that looked nearly as good.  There is a tutorial here: The Graphic Mac  The full documentation is available at Apple's developer site.  <comment8371> Tks iPacheco, I already tried the GrapgicMac method but I wasn't satisfied with the results. The process is too long. I will pay attention to Apple's developer site. Thanks
