how to restore time capsule backup inProgress <body> i have an old time capsule hard drive with a backup on it. i've restored backup from other drives, but this one has no valid backup folder (e.g. 2013-03-#######) but has a file ending with inProgress when opened in the finder. When I view "show contents" from finder, it shows a folder named "bands". it has almost 1 GB of data on it. Any suggestions? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zANC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
