Large UI on 4k Resolution <body> I am using a Mac pro with MacOS Sierra 10.12.4 When using a Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 at 4k, the UI scale gets really large.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ztbCK.jpg" alt="Screenshot at 4k resolution"  On 2k the ui looks as it should.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/08LZk.jpg" alt="Screenshot at 2k resolution"  Is there any reason why the UI would become that large at 4k?  It's not possible to properly work like that. How can I fix this issue?  <comment350487> Did you try **System Preferences  Displays  Resolution: Scaled** and then selecting one of the options? That should be the proper way of doing it. <comment350494> Yes I tried that. The setting is fully to the right at "More Space". Even with that setting the UI is upscaled like shown in the first picture.
