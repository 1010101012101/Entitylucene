On-screen text unexpectedly read to me, despite Voiceover (Mac) being disabled <body> On Mavericks, I have Voiceover turned off in both Accessibility settings and Users &amp; Groups.  In the past week, Voiceover has started occasionally reading small bits of text to me, seemingly unrequested.  It seems to primarily be subject lines of new mail in Gmail (running as a webpage in Chrome), but this could be a red herring.  Is there a keyboard shortcut or trackpad gesture that I'm accidentally doing to make this happen? What could be going on?  [strongUpdate/strong: see comments - I'm now certain it's emonly/em emails that are getting read aloud, but not sure whether it's anything to do with Chrome or not. OS-level email integration?]  <answer139946> Edit:  Read this Apple Discussions article.  I think this is the same problem you are having.     I think I got it. I was sitting at the screen when a message popped up with the voice over. There was a little spanner icon in the top right which allowed me to turn off this feature.   <comment164017> Seems a long shot, but something introduced in 10.9.4? <comment164018> Similar issue with 10.9.4 https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6441450 <comment164681> Please check option in the "Text to Speech" tab of "System Prefrences"  "Dictation & Speech"... PS you may need to tick & untick the checkbox in order to solve the issue. <comment164685> You specifically mention Chrome, but have you noticed it reading text from **any** other application? <comment164792> Good point, @jer-el. Can't tell if it only happens when Chrome's open (it's always open!), but it's definitely only reading subject lines of new mail, whether I have Gmail open in a tab or not. So I've been wondering if it's to do with OS-level email integration. No luck messing with Mail.app or Internet Accounts in System Preferences. <comment164799> Ok so if it only happens with gMail acount then the problem may be gMail settings : http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&answer=1075549&ctx=mail || https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3220216?hl=en&ref_topic=3434353 <comment165004> Sounds like a similar problem to mine, but I'm not getting onscreen notifications so have no spanner icon to click on! <comment165005> Ok, I'll look for more. <comment165006> Wait, you have the chrome notification menu item, right? <comment165007> In the menu bar? Yep, and Gmail notifications is unchecked there. Thanks anyway! <comment165008> So the bell has a red line across it?
