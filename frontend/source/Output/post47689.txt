Is it possible to use a third-party remote with an Apple TV? <body> I was thinking about this earlier and thought I'd ask. Can third-party remotes be used with the Apple TV (any and all versions)?  <answer47698> Yep. You can have your Apple TV learn the remote codes of any IR remote by going to strongSettings  General  Remotes/strong. It will then ask you to hit buttons on your new remote corresponding to what it shows on screen.  Full instructions can be found at Apple's site: Controlling Apple TV with a third-party remote control  <answer52940> I have a Logitech Harmony remote that I use with the ATV and my other equipment like receiver, tv and HDTV-box. Works fine.  <comment54662> Logictech remotes can be programmed to work and you can just go pair remote in the above menu, bingo!
