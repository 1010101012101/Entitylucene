How can I force new browser windows to open on my main display? <body> I use a MacBook Air at work connected to a larger display, which while working is my main display. I use the MacBook's display as a secondary screen on which I usually have a browser open with some tools. If I cmd-tab to the browser from another application and create a new window with cmd-n it always opens on my secondary display, since I already have one window open there. What I want is for new windows to always open on the main display. Is this possible?  <answer193724> Have you tried running your browser in fullscreen mode?
