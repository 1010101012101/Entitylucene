Windows Word License for Mac Windows <body> Will my Office for windows license work for office on mac? I don't think it will, but I was just checking.  <answer134775> No, your Windows license for Office will not work with the Mac version of Office. According to this post on a Microsoft support forum:     Mac Office (2011) is licensed as a completely separate product &amp; is produced specifically for the Mac OS. If you choose to use it you will have to purchase it outright - there is no 'transfer' of a license from one OS to another.   <comment159603> I don't believe there is a cross-transferable option. You are much better off asking this question on Microsoft Office's forums. BOL.
