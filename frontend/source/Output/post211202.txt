iMac 2008 Core 2 Duo does not list my bootable USB stick in the boot menu? <body> Hi i am trying to install OS X El Capitan on iMac 2008 model Core 2 Duo processor, and  4GB Ram. The way i followed is i created a USB bootable stick and insert to mac machine and restarted the Machine then i  pressed C key in keyboard and i waited more than 30 seconds then it is not showing any usb Bootable option and later it booted directly. Even i can`t able to Boot CD Drive also. can any one help me out here please.  <answer211218> Try:  ul liHolding down Option at boot, not C. This will show every available boot option/li liMake sure you are using a USB keyboard attached emdirectly/em to the machine/li /ul  <comment254953> Why can't you upgrade directly using the installer from the App Store? And which instructions did you follow to create the stick? <comment254954> Why didn't you just put the 'Install El Capitan' app in the Applications folder & run it from there, as intended? [btw, it's not easy getting a Mac with a Superdrive to boot from USB] <comment255014> @patrix iMac final update 10.5.8 only and App store not showing any update for iMac core 2 Duo machine <comment255015> @Tetsujin  i directly tried that option  but the app icon showing no valid symbol . <comment255031> Where did you get the installer app from? <comment255033> i have macbook pro so i downloaded from app store @patrix <comment255053> What happens if you just copy the installer to the iMac and run it there? <comment255152> iMac final support 10.5.8, we can`t upgrade through app store , even through we can`t use installer File directly then the only option is we can boot from CD/DVD or USB.
