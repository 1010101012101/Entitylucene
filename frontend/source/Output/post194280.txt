How to restart PostgreSQL installed by Brew in OSX? <body> In Linux, it can be done by code/etc/init.d/postgresql-9.2 restart/code.  My OSX is not a server app.   I think it it can be done by codeALTER USER postgres with password '1234';/code postgreQSL prompt but I am not sure if it is the meant way.  How can you restart the PostgreSQL server in OSX?  <answer194290> h2Manually Start PostgreSQL:/h2  precodepg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start /code/pre  h2Manually Stop PostgreSQL:/h2  precodepg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop -s -m fast /code/pre  This stackoverflow discussion really goes into some great detail, with many more options.  I used it to create an alias to just run:  precodepostgresql.server stop postgresql.server start /code/pre  <answer278268> Brew has that covered:  precodebrew services restart postgresql /code/pre  <comment231676> Are you using the OS X Server.app? <comment231678> How did you install PostgreSQL? There are multiple ways and each may be subtly different. <comment287109> This alias does the trick: `alias postgresql.server='function pgsql_server() { case $1 in "start") echo "Trying to start PostgreSQL..."; pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start ;; "stop") echo "Trying to stop PostgreSQL..."; pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop -s -m fast ;; esac }; pgsql_server'` Commands:  ***postgresql.server start*** or ***postgresql.server stop*** <comment361698> I just updated my Postgres via brews (uninstalling the old one), but now Postgresql starts with the yellow color (status unknown). Because of that I can't connect to it Any ideas? <comment361736> @MatheusFelipe I suggest to post a dedicated question
