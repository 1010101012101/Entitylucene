Save the URL in Finder as a bookmark via Automator <body> Since the possibility to tag files in Mavericks, I save my bookmarks in Finder to be able to tag them and find them later more quickly.  To do this I simply drag the URL in Safari to a my bookmarks folder in Finder. After doing this for many times, I found it inconvenient to do this manually. It would be nice if this steps can be automated, and I think Automator would help me in this.  The workflow would look like this.  ol liCopy the URL of the webpage in the active Safari window./li liSave the URL in a clickable URL file in a folder in Finder./li liPrompt me the Info screen to edit metatags, like Filename, Tags, and Comments./li /ol  Unfortunately, after some trying in Automator, I'm still not able to create this workflow. I hope through this post somebody can help in the right direction.  <answer112288> You could install tag with for example codebrew install tag/code and then use a script like this:  precodeset tags to text returned of (display dialog "" default answer "") tell application "Safari" to tell document 1 to set {u, t} to {URL, name} tell application "Finder"     make new internet location file at POSIX file "/Users/username/Bookmarks" to u with properties {name:t}     set p to POSIX path of (result as alias) end tell do shell script "/usr/local/bin/tag -s " &amp; quoted form of tags &amp; " " &amp; quoted form of p /code/pre  For Chrome, use codetell application "Google Chrome" to tell tab 1 of window 1 to set {u, t} to {URL, title}/code. Separate the tags with commas in the dialog.
