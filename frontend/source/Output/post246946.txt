Sending commands from TextWrangler to the terminal <body> I want to send commands from TextWrangler to the terminal. Even if I found this, I don't understand how that works since I'm brand new to Unix and running Applescripts.   precodetell application "TextWrangler"     set the_selection to (selection of front window as string)     if (the_selection) is "" then         set the_selection to line (get startLine of selection) of front window as string     end if end tell  tell application "Terminal"     do script with command the_selection in window 1 end tell /code/pre  I saved an Applescript that looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/chSu5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, what I think is to put the script in the TextWrangler Scripts Folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wP2uA.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol liBut then, how do I send commands to the Terminal.app?/li liHow can I press cmd + enter to send a line from TextWrangler to the Terminal? /li /ol  <answer246983> You must put the script in the code"/Users/yourName/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Scripts"/code folder  After that:  ul liOpen the preferences of the TextWrangler/li liSelect "Menus &amp; ShortCuts" -- "Scripts" -- "your script" to add your shortcut to the script/li liTextWrangler accept the (cmd + enter) keys as shortcut img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1eOj4.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  <answer246989> In order to use an AppleScript emscript/em in TextWrangler's Script menu, it (or a link to it) must be in TextWrangler's Script folder located at, em~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Scripts/em in order for it to appear on the menu. Note: The "~" in that path is your Home Folder and the Library folder may not be visible. You can open it from TextWrangler's Script menu, Open Scripts Folder command and place the emscript/em or link to the emscript/em from wherever you saved it.   For the purpose of answering this question I created an AppleScript named strongRun Selected Line(s) in Terminal.scpt/strong and placed it in TextWrangler's Script folder and is now available on the Script menu in TextWrangle as show in the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DEr8p.png" alt="TW_Script_Menu.png"  That said, the script you have, as written may fail as Terminal can be a bit finicky. In other words, if Terminal is closed when executing the emscript/em, then the emcode/em as written can produce an error, e.g.: "A scripting error has occurred: Terminal got an error: Canâ€™t get window 1."  Even telling Terminal to activate didn't open a window like it does when opening Terminal from the Dock Tile I have set to "Keep in Dock" and I'd get the aforementioned error. So a Google query yielded much useful information. So I experimented with a few different solutions I saw and the emcode/em I'm using is shown below.  hr  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "TextWrangler"     activate     set the_selection to (selection of front window as string)     if (the_selection) is "" then         set the_selection to line (get startLine of selection) of front window as string     end if end tell  tell application "Terminal"     if not (exists window 1) then reopen     activate     -- delay 0.5     do script with command the_selection in front window end tell /code/pre  hr  Note that I've commented out the codedelay/code emcommand/em with code--/code and may or may not be needed depending on if Terminal is initially  closed and or how slow your system responds. The emvalue/em is in emseconds/em expressed decimally. You can uncomment and modify if/as necessary.

If I want to record all of what I'm doing to test different functions without running the whole script <comment304729> This is exactly what I needed! I guess we can now use autocompletion in some way... I going to find out. Thanks! <comment304735> @jackjr300, What application did you process that Preferences image in to add the arrows, particularly the curved arrow? <comment304761> @user3439894, I use the `Preview` application on **El Capitan**, menu "**Tools**" -- "**Annotate**" -- "**Arrow**".`- ` Then drag one of the blue handles to move the arrow or resize it, drag the green handle to make a curve.`- ` You can change the shape style, you can add text at the beginning or at the end of the arrow. <comment304771> @jackjr300, Thanks for the info on the image annotation. Also thanks for the tip on assigning command-enter from TextWrangler Preferences. I had tried assigning in the Apple's System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Application Shortcuts and on OS X 10.8.5 and while I can technically assign command-enter for the script menu command in TextWrangler nonetheless it doesn't work.  It deletes what's selected and inserts a newline, which of course defeats the purpose. However when doing it from TextWrangler Preferences it works.  So thanks for everything. +1
