How to run AppleScript (.scpt) as LaucnDaemon by root <body> I have an AppleScript or set of Applescripts that I am trying to run as a LaunchDaemon. I have no problem running the LaunchDaemon with my user. The problem comes in where I have the need to read a file that is only readable by root, this is by design for security reasons as the file contains sensitive information.   I have installed the necessary precompiled AppleScript files, the .scpt files, in:  precode/Library/Scripts/myApplication/ /code/pre  I have put my plists under:  precode/Library/LaunchDaemons /code/pre  strongEdit:/strong Here is the plist for my Daemon:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"     "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.service&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;       &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/osascript&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;string&gt;/Library/Scripts/myApp/myApp.scpt&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  Now, when I try to load the plists using launchctl and sudo   precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mycompany.myapp.service.plist /code/pre  I get errors in the systemlog.log:  precodeAug 26 17:54:13 computername com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.mycompany.myapp.service[74757]): Service exited with abnormal code: 1 Aug 26 17:54:13 computername com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.mycompany.myapp.service): Service only ran for 0 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 10 seconds. /code/pre  However if I drop the "sudo" from the launchctl command it works perfectly. I have even tried running the scripts from the terminal as the root user, which also works fine. However, as soon as I try to load them with launchctl and sudo everything dies.  In order to get this script to run previously I had to give the application running the script accessibility privileges on the machine, so previously Sublime Text 2, Terminal and Script Editor. I am guessing that this what is causing the script to not run but I do not know which program to enable under accessibility, since I am not being prompted. So how do I get this script to run the way I need it to?  <answer207859> Assuming your launchd job is correctly set-up, you may be reaching a limitation of AppleScript.  h1AppleScript Requires a GUI (Aqua Session)/h1  If your AppleScript is launched using launchd as a user coderoot/code process, it will not have a graphical user interface associated. The majority of AppleScript requires a graphic user interface to work consistently. Depending on the version of OS X, it may work, but it is not designed to.  Processes on OS X can not trivially cross between user sessions.  h2Do Shell Script/h2  A more robust approach is to separate out the functionality needing higher privileges into a shell script such as bash, perl, ruby, or python.  Your AppleScript can then call that script using AppleScript's strongdo shell script/strong:  precodedo shell script "command" user name "me" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges /code/pre  If you need to avoid embedding a username and password, this is possible but beyond the scope of this question.  <comment243887> Please share the contents of your LaunchDaemon plist. <comment243943> try and set it up with lingon  https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/ Which has options for this if I remember right
