Where is the "Home Computer" information that prevents syncing with other libraries stored on an iPod Classic? <body> The iPod Classic (and maybe others?) refuses to sync with more than one iTunes library at a time. This is very frustrating when I keep my music on multiple computers.  Where is the "Home Computer" information stored on the iPod? Is it a file? If so where in the iPod filesystem does it live?  <answer53161> I've been able to do this successfully suing codersync/code to copy my code~/Music/iTunes//code directory from my "Home Computer" to other computers. I don't remember exactly where the magic is, but it emis/em within iTune's metadata.  Once you sync the first time you don't ever emneed/em to sync again. The libraries can diverge after that and your iPod will still consider them both to be the same library.
