Backup And Restore iPhone Text Messages <body> I have an iPhone that I need to wipe because I need to send it to Apple for the Lock Button Replacement Program.  The only issue is I need to restore my iPhone and I don't want to lose my text messages and iMessages. If I backup my iPhone to iTunes will I be able to recover them when I get my iPhone back and still use them with the 'messages' application and not a 'SQL lite' app?  <answer177467> An iTunes backup includes text messages. See this Apple page for what is included. Notice that to restore everything, including passwords, you need to encrypt the iTunes backup with a password.
