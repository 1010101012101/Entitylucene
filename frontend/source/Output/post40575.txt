TotalTerminal doesn't work with full-screen apps <body> TotalTerminal (former Visor) is an awesome plugin for Terminal that turns it into a Quake-style console that slides down on a key combination.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tgzog.png" alt="TotalTerminal"  This is tremendously useful for development because I can type commands while writing code or browsing without extra window hustle.  Unfortunately, TotalTerminal doesn't play well with fullscreen apps. If I put Sublime Text in fullscreen mode and trigger Terminal, Mission Control will scroll to the nearest non-fullscreen space available, and only then will it show the Terminal.  This is very annoying. Is it possible to fix or work around this issue?  <answer40577> This is a known issue and the author doesn't plan to fix it.     I encourage someone to go further and implement it because personally I don't use fullscreen apps right now and I don't plan to fix this anytime soon.   Luckily, there is a workaround described by vvlad.     As an workaround you can set codeLSUIElement/code in Terminal's Info.plist   It has several drawbacks but otherwise works like a charm:     ul   liTerminal no longer shows on Dock;/li   liThere is a space the size of the top bar on top of every TotalTerminal visor opened on fullscreen apps windows;/li   liYou can no longer kbd⌘/kbdkbd⇥/kbd to regular Terminal windows;/li   liYou cannot Force Kill Terminal process./li   /ul   This is how it will look like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/53aiN.png" alt="TotalTerminal on a fullscreen app"  h2How It Works/h2     LSUIElement (String - Mac OS X) specifies whether the application runs as an agent application. If this key is set to “1”, Launch Services runs the application as an agent application. Agent applications do not appear in the Dock or in the Force Quit window. Although they typically run as background applications, they can come to the foreground to present a user interface if desired. A click on a window belonging to an agent application brings that application forward to handle events.      The Dock and loginwindow are two applications that run as agent applications.   h2How to Do It/h2  ol liOpen Terminal (assuming you already have TotalTerminal installed)/li liRun codesudo nano /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Info.plist/code/li liAdd these two lines right after opening code&lt;dict&gt;/code tag:  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true /&gt; /code/pre/li liSave and close the file by pressing kbd^/kbdkbdO/kbd kbdEnter/kbd kbd^/kbdkbdX/kbd/li liQuit Terminal and launch it again/li /ol  <answer139725> TotalTerminal has an option in its preferences panel now for enabling the same underlying option @Dan's answer illustrates setting manually:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUoDr.png" alt="Screenshot of TotalTerminal preferences"  <answer188997> strongYosemite Users/strong  Apple changed the way the LSUIElement works in Yosemite.  It will cause the app to run as an agent but will no longer cause it to overlay full screen Windows.  To fix, open up the Info.plist file per other people's instructions and add the following two elements:  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;LSUIPresentationMode&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;4&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre     LSUIPresentationMode (Number - OS X) identifies the initial user-interface mode for the app. You would use this in apps that may need to take over portions of the screen that contain UI elements such as the Dock and menu bar. Most modes affect only UI elements that appear in the content area of the screen, that is, the area of the screen that does not include the menu bar. However, you can request that all UI elements be hidden as well.      4 - All suppressed mode. In this mode, all UI elements are hidden, including the menu bar. UI elements may show themselves automatically in response to mouse movements or other user activity. This option is available only in OS X v10.3 and later.

Whenever TotalTerminal is shown it switches back to the primary Space. <comment223851> @rossipedia - See my answer below for Yosemite fix.
