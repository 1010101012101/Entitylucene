Very quiet audio output under Windows 10 (Late 2016 MacBook Pro) <body> After installing Windows 10 with Boot Camp Assistant for my Late-2016 15" MacBook Pro, I'm finding maximum volume to be almost inaudibly quiet under nearly all uses. The audio is deafeningly loud at full volume under macOS, so something is definitely wrong   Windows shows the volume is maxed. Nothing obvious in control panel. The driver is apparently "Cirrius", but I know nothing about it.   Searching around yields a lot of similar complaints from 2009, and advice to install Realtek drivers, but that's so out of date I don't suspect I should risk it. Any ideas?  <answer269081> I have the same problem on a MacBook Air with the Cirrius drivers. I managed to get the volume to boost a little by checking the "disable all enhancements" box on the sound properties (as some online had suggested from a few years back), but still no where near as load as it gets on a Mac. It is certainly a driver issue but so far I've yet to find a fixed driver.  <answer275945> I installed win 10 on a dell optiplex, low sound on headphones, tried all the adjustments, (another dell was OK though, it can be individual PCs), anyway I solved it by using a usb sound card from ebay Â£ 3 -4,  it has mike and headphone jacks, and sound is back to normal...it might also work if you got usb headphones but not tried yet...  <comment334223> I have the same problem. On macos volume is fantastic but on windows 10 very low. Have you solved this already? <comment334474> sorry, no luck! <comment338204> That actually worked. I don't know who downvoted this. +1 for valid answer.
