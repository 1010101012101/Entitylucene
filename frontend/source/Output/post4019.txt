How do I invert the colors on my iPhone? <body> As a prank someone has inverted the colors on my iPhone. Black is white, blue is orange, etc. How do I get my phone back to normal?  <answer4020> Go to Settings - General - Accessibility and set "White on Black" to Off.  <comment3808> Wow, interesting. I wonder what's the real point of this feature though (probably not pranks)... <comment3809> Inverting the colors helps people with poor eyesight. <comment3825> There's also a shortcut (disabled by default) to switch between the normal and inverted displays, which is pressing the Home button 3 times in a row.
