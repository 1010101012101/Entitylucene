Port forwarding on iPhone? <body> I'm using iPhone as a modem.  Is there a way to port forward to my computer because I'm using it as a development server.  <answer218845> h3Short answer/h3  Until now (iOS 9.1) there has been strongno way/strong to configure port forwarding in Personal Hotspot  h3Long Answer/h3  Activating Personal Hotspot on an iOS device enables it's built-in NAT router. Other devices that connect to this iPhone (using USB, WiFi or Bluetooth) get an IP in the 172.16.0.0/12 subdomain.  There are no NAT settings in iOS, nor does it provide UPnP or NAT-PMP for remote NAT configuration.  h3Why?/h3  Nobody knows Apple's reasons.   Wild guess: Knowing that availability of the Personal Hotspot feature on an iOS device depends on it's carrier, Apple may have disabled further features as way to play nice with the carriers.   h3Possible Workarounds/h3  ul liOn the device that needs to accept incoming connections: connect to a VPN that provides a public IP and incoming connections/li liIf you have access to the remote device you could create a tunnel (e.g. with ssh)/li liIf the remote device is connected to the same iCloud account, enabling Back to my Mac will put you on the same private IPv6 network/li liUsing a 4G emmodem/em instead of your iPhone will give you a direct internet connection accepting incoming connections/li /ul  <comment9860> This isn't really about computer hardware or software <comment9862> Jailbroken? Then certainly. Not jailbroken? Probably not. <comment372858>  Using a 4G modem instead of your iPhone will give you a direct internet connection accepting incoming connections Yes that's what I tried to do with a Modem Domino Huawei 4G but that didn't work because functionalities are deliberately limited by the ISP (Orange) : it's not an original Domino Huawei, it's transformed. I'll try desimlock (need to find an adaptator for micro SIM) but that may not have anything to do with accessing to port forwarding... So be carefull **what** 4G modem you buy !
