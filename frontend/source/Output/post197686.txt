Applescript causes long error messages to be logged in system.log <body> I have this very simple script...  precodetell application "System Events"     set activeApp to short name of first process whose frontmost is true end tell  tell application activeApp     repeat 5 times         display dialog "Hello world" giving up after 2         delay 2     end repeat end tell /code/pre  and it works fine, but every time the dialog is displayed the following errors are logged,  code27/07/15 8:32:48 PM    AppleScript Editor[43002]   -[NSCarbonWindowFrame aspectRatio]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x116411470/code  code27/07/15 8:32:48 PM    AppleScript Editor[43002]   HIToolbox: ignoring exception '-[NSCarbonWindowFrame aspectRatio]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x116411470' that raised inside Carbon event dispatch (  .... trace .... )/code  which is flooding my system log. This happens regardless of the active application.  Any idea why and how to stop the errors?   <answer197687> I just discovered that a nested codetell/code will stop the errors, ie  precodetell application "System Events"     set activeApp to short name of first process whose frontmost is true     tell application activeApp         repeat 5 times             display dialog "Hello world" giving up after 2             delay 2         end repeat     end tell end tell /code/pre  Still don't know why though...
