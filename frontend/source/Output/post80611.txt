Merging Multiple CSV Files without merging the header <body> I need to merge multiple .CSV files (using the codecat/code command) but without copying the header for each file.   What's the best way to accomplish this task?  <answer80614> You'll need more than the codecat/code command, as described here:  Say you have 3 CSV-files: codefile1.csv/code, codefile2.csv/code, and codefile3.csv/code and want to join them to codebigfile.csv/code and your header is always (only) the first line, then use   either (keep header from first file):  precodecat &lt; file1.csv &lt;(tail +2 file2.csv) &lt;(tail +2 file3.csv) &gt; bigfile.csv /code/pre  or (remove header from all files who's names begin with "file"):  precodeawk 'FNR &gt; 1' file*.csv &gt; bigfile.csv /code/pre  <answer88564> You could also use a group command (code{ ; }/code) instead of process substitution (code&lt;()/code):  precode{ head -n1 file1.csv; for f in file*.csv; do tail -n+2 "$f"; done; } &gt; new.csv /code/pre  It also works with CRLF line endings as long as the files end with an empty line (code\r\n/code).  The number-only versions of head and tail were made obsolete by POSIX 1003.1-2001, and they result in warnings in some environments.  <answer107483> Using the command sequence above resulted in a file looking like this:  precodeheader,of,csv1 contents,of,csv1 ==&gt; csv2.csv  contents,of,csv2 /code/pre  To make it a proper CSV, with one header line and all the relevant values, I employed the following codesed/code incantation... codesed -ie "/^$/d;/^==&gt;/d" bigfile.csv/code  <answer275970> Needed to concatenate two large CSVs with identical columns into larger CSV for chunking script (data does not have unique id's).    strongFirst took header out of second csv/strong   precodeawk 'FNR &gt; 1' file2.csv &gt; file2_noheading.csv /code/pre  strongNext, concatenated via the following/strong  precodecat file1.csv file2_noheading.csv &gt; newfile.csv /code/pre  <answer276949> Easier Solution if you have a ton of files :   precodeawk 'FNR &gt; 1' *.csv &gt; merged.csv /code/pre  Just go back to edit the big file and add the header back in.  <comment110579> I found this looking for a generic linux answer, but in my case this didn't exactly work. It would silently ignore file1.csv. I needed to cat that file.      `cat (cat file1.csv) (tail +2 file2.csv) (tail +2 file3.csv)  bigfile.csv` <comment133199> I am getting tail+2: command not found when i used cat  file1.csv (tail +2 file2.csv) (tail +2 file3.csv)  bigfile.csv method <comment133210> @user64636 there should be a space character between tail and +2 <comment136357> actually I had to use `tail -n+2`, `tail +2` wouldn't work <comment348641> How is your answer any different than what was all ready presented by iolsmit in 2013, being `awk 'FNR  1' file*.csv  bigfile.csv`? It's not!
