What can I do with an iPad Bluetooth-paired to a Mac? <body> I have successfully paired my iPad Gen 3 to my Mid-2012 MacBook Air. What can I do with this connection?  <answer75239> Not a whole heck of a lot, as it turns out, but which stems from the difference between iOS and OS X ... which it emseems/em ought to talk to each other directly, but no. Not in the cards.  See this post: What is the use of the bluetooth on iPad?  <answer75421> If you have an iPad with a cellular data connection, you can use Bluetooth for tethering. It's likely more battery-friendly than using Wi-Fi.  <answer79356> I recently gave a presentation using Keynote on my MacBook and keynote remote on my ipad. This is a really cool solution that allows you to control slide movement on the MacBook while seeing both slides and presenter notes on the ipad.
