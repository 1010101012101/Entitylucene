iOS app to transfer images, photos to another phone via Bluetooth <body> Is there an app that can help me get connected to bluetooth in mobile phones manufactured by companies like nokia, samsunng, etc  <answer8593> The iPhone 4 does not support the Bluetooth OPP profiles which you need for standard device to device transfers. All you have available are   ul liHFP (handsfree)/li liPBAP (Phonebook access)/li liA2DP (advanced audio distribution)/li liAVRCP (av remote)/li liPAN (Personal Area Network)/li liHID (Human Interface)/li /ul  Peer to peer comms are possible over BT but the app has to implement the protocol stack itself  <answer8716> There is word out on a jailbroken app in development called Celeste that should be able to do that and is rumored to be release soon.br If you are still on iOS3 you could try iBlueNova.  <answer121670> You can use iBlueNova; it is a commercial app that you have to pay for. Alternatively, you can jailbreak your iPhone and maybe then you can send pictures and files to other phones without needing a commercial app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8qcw.jpg" alt="iBlueNova screenshot from the App Store"  <comment9175> I'm not sure what you are asking.  You want to connect the iPhone 4 to other phones via bluetooth?  What do you want the phones to do once they are connected via bluetooth? <comment9176> i want to transfer pictures, songs and messages. Is there a app for that?
