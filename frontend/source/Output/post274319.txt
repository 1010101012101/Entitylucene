Launch an applescript on iTunes import <body> I'm looking to automate the tagging of tracks with a category upon import to iTunes.  The concept is as follows; every time an audio file is incorporated into the iTunes Library, this triggers a script that would select the newly added tracks, and edit their "category" field to contain a specific tag identifying the machine they were imported on, and the date of their addition the the iTunes Library.  Doug's Apple scripts has a service script to edit the category field of selected tracks manually, but I'm looking to automate this process.  Can scripts or automator actions be triggered by an application action like adding files the the iTunes Library?
