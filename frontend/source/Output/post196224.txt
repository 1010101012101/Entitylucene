Unix "ln -s" command not permitted in OSX El Capitan Beta3 <body> I was installing nodejs for Symphony and I don't know why happend this but i need to solve it. Anyone knows why?     MacBook-Pro-de-XXX:~ XXX$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node      Password:       ln: /usr/bin/node: Operation not permitted   <answer196226> This is the so called "rootless" mode in the new version of OS X. It effectively makes certain system directories read-only (even for admins). "/usr" is one of those protected directories (the only subdirectory that is excluded from this rule is "/usr/local")  One can disable this rootless mode with the following commands:  precode$ sudo nvram boot-args="rootless=0" $ sudo reboot /code/pre  But this is not recommended! The best practice is to install custom stuff to "/usr/local" only.  hr  Update (27-Oct-15): strong10.11 (El Capitan) Public Release/strong  Please note that the above described workaround will strongnot/strong work with the public release of El Capitan anymore as Apple has changed things around.  The proper way to disable the "rootless" mode (aka System Integrity Protection, "SIP") is to boot temporarily into Recover Mode (hold Command+R during boot) and use the codecsrutil disable/code command (or codecsrutil enable/code to reenable) from the Terminal. The Terminal is reachable via the menu of the Installer that launches in Recovery Mode.  <answer233552> In my version of El Capitan the code/bin/code directory did not exist :  code/usr/local/bin/code  So, the fix was :   codemkdir -p /usr/local/bin/code  The code-p/code flag will create the dir (and incidentally any dirs in the full path) if it does not exist.  Then you can create symlinks &amp; copy apps to code/usr/local/bin/code because code/usr/local/code not part of the "rootless" mode.  <comment234369> First check whether /usr/bin/node is already set up.  If you want to change it, you can use ln -sf to force the symlink. <comment234370> MacBook-Pro-de-XXX:~ XXX$ which node /usr/local/bin/node <comment234371> ls -la /usr/bin/node <comment234372> MacBook-Pro-de-XXX:~ XXX$ ls -la /usr/bin/node ls: /usr/bin/node: No such file or directory <comment236766> Might not be advisable, but for now MacTeX seems to expect `/usr/texbin`, so away we go! <comment248470> Modifying NVRAM to disable rootless mode doesn't work on El Capitan from (at least) the GM version forward.

Sometimes you just need symlinks in /usr/bin and cannot avoid that.
