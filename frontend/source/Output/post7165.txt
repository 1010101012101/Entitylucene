How do I type š on an international keyboard? <body> I'm currently writing emails frequently to a Slovenian who has the letter š in his name. I use copy and paste for the letter š, which is quite inconvenient.  I'm using the US keyboard layout.  How can I type this letter directly from the keyboard?  <answer7166> Right Option (Alt) v s  You must have U.S. Extended keyboard layout enabled for the above to work.  <answer7167> You can choose edit menu (in most software)  then choose codeSpecial Character ../code then go to codeAccented Latin/code tab and find your character codeŠ/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CxUnA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer7171> If you have the patience to configure the keybindings, you can try Ukelele and create a keyboard layout for your needs.  <answer7216> I'm not near my iMac right now, so I can't test this. But this usually works for me http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/8504.html  <answer7221> I have long had the same problem. My solution: install the Slovenian keyboard layout and set the shortcut to changing between keyboards to Option+Tab. That works very quickly and gives you all the special letters (they are in place of the paranthesis and quotation keys on an English keyboard.)   <answer267671> Simply hold down the S key and you'll be presented with three options - press 3 on your keyboard to type š. If you need a capital Š just use the Shift Key or Caps Lock.  <comment7641> which keyboard layout are you using? <comment7695> @Agos US keyboard layout <comment7696> Thanks, but I'm looking for a direct way of typing this on the keyboard, just like I do alt+u o to get ö and alt+n n to get ñ <comment7697> That did it, after turning on US Extended keyboard layout. Thanks.
