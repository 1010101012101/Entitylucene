How to tell what version a Snow Leopard DVD is? <body> I have a Snow Leopard DVD that was copied from the original. All it says on the CD is "Snow Leopard" How can I tell what version of the DVD it is? The DVDs were only released in versions 10.6.0 and 10.6.3.   <answer40773> You should be able to see the OS version by going to System Preferences  Startup Disk. If it doesn't show in Startup Disk for some reason, you can run the following command in Terminal:  precodedefaults read "/Volumes/Mac OS X Install DVD/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion" ProductVersion /code/pre  If your DVD is not called "Mac OS X Install DVD" then you'll need to replace that part of the command with the actual disc name.  <comment46136> Are you asking just out of curiosity or is their a specific reason behind it? <comment46137> @patrix I'm making a NetInstall image of it for a Netboot server and want to make sure I have 10.6.3 and not 10.6.0. <comment46139> I have a 10.6.2 here, came together with the late 2009 iMac. <comment46142> Yeah, that's an special build for your iMac. The DVDs I'm talking about are the reference releases sold by Apple in stores. <comment46143> Thanks! Don't know why I didn't think of that.
