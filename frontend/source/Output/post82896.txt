Is it possible to compile and run an Xcode project on a jailbroken device without a paid developer certificate? <body> Both for kicks and for budgetary reasons, I'd like to take a package that would normally require a developer account and build an app to run on a jailbroken iOS device.  I have a 5th gen iPod Touch, jailbroken using evasi0n, running iOS 6.1.  I am using Xcode 4.6 with OS X (10.8.2) Lion.  <answer82902> The following instructional steps to accomplish this purpose are taken from: http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Xcode  My findings and actions are provided under each step.  strong1. Create a self-signed code-signing certificate with the name “iPhone Developer” on the “login” (default) keychain using Keychain Access./strong  ul liI took screenshots as I followed the above instruction. /li liI left most fields blank or at their default value./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kzLDB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strong2. Open code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Info.plist/code (4.2 or below: code/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Info.plist/code). You may need root permission./strong  ul liI'm using Xcode 4.6, so I opened the former code.plist/code file./li /ul  strong3. Replace all occurrences of codeXCiPhoneOSCodeSignContext/code by codeXCCodeSignContext/code. There are three of them (XCode Version 3.2.4+)./strong  ul liI made three modifications as the screenshots indicate./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jKJep.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKkMg.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HRxE.png" alt="enter image description here"  strong4. Save the file and restart Xcode./strong  ul liSaved the file./li /ul  strong5. Make sure you have ldid on your Mac. Place a copy somewhere e.g. in code/usr/local/bin/code./strong  ul liI downloaded ldid from http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/downloads/detail?name=ldid/li liI put it in code/usr/local/bin/code./li /ul  strong6. Create the a Python script ldid3.py right next to the ldid program. Make it executable. Fill it with:/strong   precode#!/usr/bin/env python  from sys import argv from subprocess import check_call from os.path import basename, dirname, splitext, join from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile  app = argv[-1] ldid_path = join(dirname(__file__), 'ldid') obj_path = join(app, splitext(basename(app))[0])  if '-gta' not in argv:     check_call([ldid_path, '-S', obj_path]) else:     with NamedTemporaryFile('w+b', 0) as f:         f.write(""" &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;get-task-allow&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt;         """)         check_call([ldid_path, '-S' + f.name, obj_path]) /code/pre  ul liI created a new plain text file and copy-pasted the above code into it./li liI saved this file as codeldid3.py/code and stored it in the code/usr/local/bin/code directory./li liIn terminal, ran codechmod 777 /usr/local/bin/ldid3.py/code./li /ul  strong7. Open codeiPhoneCodeSign.xcspec/code. This file can be found in [For Xcode 4.6: code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/iPhoneCodeSign.xcspec/code]:/strong  strong8. Change the entry in the file from calling codecodesign/code to codeldid3.py/code./strong  ul liAs per instruction official instruction, converted the spec file to plain text by typing in console: codesudo plutil -convert xml1 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/iPhoneCodeSign.xcspec/code/li liI opened the file with TextEdit./li liReplaced code&lt;key&gt;CommandLine&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/codesign&lt;/string&gt;/code with code&lt;key&gt;CommandLine&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/ldid3.py&lt;/string&gt;/code./li /ul  strong9. Save the file and restart Xcode./strong  ul liI saved the file and quit TextEdit./li /ul  strong10. Create a file code/var/mobile/tdmtanf/code on the device, to enable Apple's "TDMTANF bypass" in installd (warning: doing so will also put you in a sandboxed GameCenter)./strong  ul liI create an empty text file in Windows, named it codetdmtanf/code, SSH'd into my iPod, uploaded it to code/var/mobile//code, and reboot my iPod./li /ul  h2Now that all that is over with.../h2  I open my existing Xcode project and hit Run. It works in the iOS Simulator without any problems.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UlTht.png" alt="enter image description here"  I make sure that Code Signing is set to use the certificate set up in step 1.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OpsTP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I build the app (Project  Build). A success message follows.  I grab my app folder codeTicTacToe.app/code from code/Libary/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TicTacToe-cjgzmoxtflyegtfypsbxbuiuwxns/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos//code and transfer it to my Windows machine to install onto my iPod.  In an attempt to install the app to my iPod, I drag codeTicTacToe.app/code onto the applications section of iPhone Configuration Utility, but I received this error message saying that my app "is not a valid mobile application."  I have also tried manually installing the app using strongiFunbox/strong and the strongAppCake/strong app found in Cydia. Both fail.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iwJzX.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZBnfh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  As a point of interest, because as I've Googled around, I've noticed many people mention the importance of this: I do have AppSync installed. (Sorry for the huge screenshot. If I should take it down, please let me know!)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GIPiZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Conclusion/h2  So despite following the instructions closely, several times, my app is not recognized by iPhone Configuration Utility as a valid app. I cannot install the app manually using programs like iFunbox, or Cydia apps like AppCake.  I suspect the app is indeed invalid, but having followed the instructions carefully, I'm not sure why.  Can anyone tell me why my app is not valid, and what I can do to fix this, besides coughing up money that is?  <answer85303> You can connect your device and select your iOS Device as Run target. when its run, the application automatically installed on your device. Or you can select your iOS Device, then no need to Run just Build and Archive it. After that, distribute... choose Save for Enterprise or Ad-Hoc Deployment. You'll get your .ipa file.  Hope it can help you..  <answer134350> continuing @joncom s answer.. you can add the .app files to your iPhone directly, just with a few extra steps.  ul licopy the code.app/code file onto your desktop, and then zip it/li lirename the code[yourappname].zip/code to code[yourappname].ipa/code /li lithen go ahead and download AppSync from cydia/li lidownload and install the .ipa file onto your device/li /ul  NOTE:  you can also do this directly without going through all the python code modification the @joncom mentioned.. read more here  <comment95569> It was an interesting reading, though. <comment95635> Nope - glad to have read it and will probably return to it in the future. Thanks for sharing it. <comment96981> [This](http://www.alexwhittemore.com/developing-jailbroken-iphone-ios-401/) was very helpful to me when working on Xcode 4.2 and iOS 4, I hope someone can update the procedure to Xcode 4.6 <comment102109> After downloading ldid you need to change its permissions to 755 with chmod 755 ldid. This was causing me an exit 1 error.
