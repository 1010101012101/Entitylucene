How do I force a partition and format on a USB key in OS X Mountain Lion Disk Utility or from CLI diskutil? <body> I have a brand new Memorex TravelDrive 64GB USB disk which is being troublesome.  It's formatted FAT16 on MBR, which is not so nice, and I'd like to put it on HFS+.    I've tried to do this through the Erase and Partition tabs in Disk Utility, as well as from the CLI in Terminal.app via a couple different methods:  precode$ diskutil partitionDisk disk4 1 GPT HFS+ newdisk R $ diskutil eraseDisk HFS+ newdisk disk4 /code/pre  In those, codedisk4/code represents the special device or disk identifier (i.e., code/dev/disk4/code) and codenewdisk/code is the arbitrary name I'm giving the new volume on the disk.  In all cases, the process hangs trying to unmount the disk.  I've done a bit of investigation, to no avail:  ol liTailing the Disk Utility log while it's running (codetail -f ~/Library/Logs/DiskUtility.log/code) doesn't provide any useful information.  All I see is:  precodeStarting next Erase job: 6 with no options 2013-03-03 00:51:57 -0500: Preparing to erase : “newdisk” 2013-03-03 00:51:57 -0500:  Partition Scheme: GUID Partition Table 2013-03-03 00:51:57 -0500:  1 volume will be created 2013-03-03 00:51:57 -0500:      Name        : “newdisk” 2013-03-03 00:51:57 -0500:      Size        : 63.92 GB 2013-03-03 00:51:57 -0500:      File system : Mac OS Extended (Journaled)  dmAsyncStartedForDisk for disk4  2013-03-03 00:35:30 -0500: Unmounting disk /code/pre  and it hangs there, thus having me need to "Stop Progress" from the Debug menu after 20 or 30 minutes./li liTrying to figure out if something has hold of the disk for some other purpose doesn't reveal anything either -- codeps aux | grep fsck/code returns only one process:  precoderyan        4967   1.0  0.0  2432768    588 s003  R+   12:57AM   0:00.00 grep fsck /code/pre/li /ol  Anyone have thoughts on how to figure out what's going on here?  <answer207370> It sure looks like you have all the correct commands. Have you tested these media using Disk Utility or tried your commands on a USB drive you could stand to erase?  My suspicion is the storage you are using isn't 100% functional.  <answer224208> You need to use code/dev/disk4/code in place of just codedisk 4/code in your command. It should read like this  precodediskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk4 1 GPT HFS+ newdisk R /code/pre  <answer237067> Try codediskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk4 1 GPT HFS+ newdisk R/code  <comment96751> You have a 64GB USB disk with a single MBR partition formatted as FAT and you want to make it a single GPT partition formatted as HFS+. Did I get it right? <comment97625> Yes, that's exactly what I'm trying to do.  It doesn't seem to want to get past the unmount. <comment97646> Try formatting it with `fdisk` as an MBR disk and then use Disk Utility on it. May be the factory-set FAT partition is causing problems. <comment271885> It's always possible you have a bad USB FWIW, just throwing that in the mix, as the one answer suggests. I know it's a heresy to suggest this here, but will it format on a Windows machine? <comment316215> Years late with this comment, but I'd suspect a fake drive. How can a 64GB drive be FAT16?
