I need to batch move files from one location to another, and put them in pre-existing folders with the same first 7 characters <body> I am looking to automate moving large amounts of files. Basically I have one location on our network full of .zip files. They are all named like "12-3456.zip" etc. I need to move each of these .zip file to a different location on our network which contains pre existing folders already named. Need to move the .zip file to the folder with the same name. I found something similar to this here but is seems to choke on large amounts of files.  Any help/advice/experience with similar problem?  Thanks,  <comment229561> Why thawed applescript and javascript? <comment229686> So, to be clear, you want to move from one directory the .zip files into a different directory in which the subdirectories with the same name as the .zip? <comment229827> how many files are we talking about?
