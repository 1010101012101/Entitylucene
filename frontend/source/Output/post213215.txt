How to disable "split view"? <body> Is it possible to bring back simple window maximize button as it was before and when holding option to use split view?  <answer213249> You cannot change that function of Full Screen button to, but there is simple workaround. Go to Keyboard Preference Pane  Shortcuts  App Shotcuts  +  All Applications, and Menu Title to strongZoom/Maximise/strong, choose a shortcut of your preference. Now you can use that shortcut to mimic the behaviour of "old" Maximise button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2syTe.png" alt="Adding a Zoom Shortcut"  <comment257466> I'm not completely sure what you asking for. You want application windows to take up the whole screen? Not like full screen mode? <comment313940> You can disable Split View (I found this out today, quite by accident). System Preferences  Mission Control  Uncheck `Displays have separate Spaces`.  As far as window maximizing, I don't know if it's possible to bring back the button, but you can double click the toolbar to maximize a window.
