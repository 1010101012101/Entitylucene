How do I change user account used by the Update tab of AppStore? <body> On the bottom of the Featured tab Apple ID is correct, but when I try to update an app App Store asks me a password for the old Apple ID that I no longer have.  <answer125957> That's because you downloaded some app using that old ID. When the app downloaded using that ID tries to update, it asks for the password of that ID.  <answer125958> You bought the apps with your old Apple ID. Apps are permanently tied to the ID with which they were bought.  I'm fairly certain if you deleted them, and re-downloaded them with your new ID, the problem would be solved. You would, however, have to pay for them again if they were not free.  Relevant questions:  Attempting to update app asks for a different iTunes account password (pretty much a duplicate)  How can I find which account I used for downloading my iOS apps?
