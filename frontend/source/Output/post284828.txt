Airpods just disappeared from settings <body> I updated to the latest iOS today and I heard there is a new version for Airpods also. So I paired them with the device then put them in their case.  What's interesting is that you can't check their firmware on the iPhone since they just disappear from the codegeneral-&gt;about/code menu on the iPhone.  Actually they are no where on the phone, but you can still hear music and pair them.  Not only I don't know how to update them, I also can't check their version now.  <answer284835> Credit to 9to5Macbr  h2To check &amp; update the AirPod firmware, do the following:/h2  ol liHave your AirPods nearby and open the case. The normal status/connectivity window will pop up, but you can swipe that away and look at the ‘About’ screen and scroll all the way the way down./li liOn the iPhone/iPad, go to codeSettings -&gt; About/code. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IuIWh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liOpen the AirPods case and have them near your phone. /li liTap the new codeAirPods/code section in the codeAbout/code menu. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p1QVn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liFrom there, you’ll be able to see detailed information about your AirPods, including the model number, serial number, and hardware version. Your info should be similar to this:  ul liManufacturer: Apple Inc./li liModel Number: A1523/li liFirmaware Version: 3.5.1/li liHardware Version: 1.0.0/li /ul/li liIf the codeFirmware Version/code is not strong3.5.1/strong then you'll need to update them.  Just keep them in their case, plug them in, and next to your iPhone.  The update should happen automatically.  It might take a few hours so it's best to leave them overnight so the update can take place./li /ol  <comment359196> Have you tried to restart your phone?
