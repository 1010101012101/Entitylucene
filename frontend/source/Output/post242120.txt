Mount point for USB devices on Mac <body> I'm familiar with Ubuntu where USB devices are mounted at code/dev/bus/usb/xxx/yyy/code. Is there an equivalent for Mac, i.e. a file system location where all USB devices (not just drives in /Volumes) are mounted?  <answer242127> OSX is much simpler than Ubuntu, the only mount that will occur to USB devices' FSs is the one with mount point located at /Volumes. Even if every file system (which of course mounts as a folder) has some little differences from an actual folder. These differences make it appear as a directory transparently to the programs, but allow apps such as Finder to differentiate folders' and volumes' icons - for example.  <comment297668> What if I want to interact with a non disk device, e.g. a mouse? <comment297669> In that case, it doesn't mount as a file system, so if it is not supported by OS X or you want to use/create an API to communicate with it, I'm sorry to say these things are managed at a very low level with kind of "drivers" built-in the OS itself. This means that there's a very little you can do. For example, launching /Applications/System Preferences.app shows only a few adjustments for your peripherals, but nothing to do with Ubuntu capabilities in this "field". <comment297671> Audio devices can also be managed from MIDI Configuration Utility
