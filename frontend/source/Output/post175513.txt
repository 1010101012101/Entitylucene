Is there anything we can do on iOS to stay safe while waiting for Apple to issue an update for the latest FREAK SSL vulnerability? <body> I guess the vulnerability has been around for a decade [ars technica], but should we just stay away from using any personal information until there is a security patch?  <answer175518> Use Chrome for the moment. IIRC, Mac Firefox (and Chrome) uses a vulnerable crypto library, but Google has promised a fix for Mac Chrome is imminent.  See this site for a table of vulnerable and safe browsers.   <comment206990> The question is about iOS :-) <comment206995> I know the question is about iOS however to comment on Firefox, I just tested it with Firefox 36 under OS X10.8.5  against FREAK at [Tracking the FREAK Attack](https://freakattack.com/) and it's fine.  It reported "Good News! Your browser appears to be safe from the FREAK attack."
