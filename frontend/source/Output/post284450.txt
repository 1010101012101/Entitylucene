Time Machine backups to a Veracrypt volume? <body> I've got an external USB drive with a few VeraCrypt volumes. I want to use one of them for my Time Machine backups. The partition can be deleted entirely, I just wish to keep it encrypted with VeraCrypt.   Is this possible? When trying to set things up like this, I cannot select this partition as a backup volume in Time Machine settings.  I know I can also create and format a regular partition and use that in Time Machine, and use macOS' or Time Machine's own encryption. But I prefer VeraCrypt.  Note that I'm not using a VeraCrypt container, but an actual partition. Which is then mounted and formatted with regular HPFS+, so I would say after mounting it's virtually the same as without VeraCrypt. But somehow Time Machine won't allow me to select this volume...?  <answer284452> You need to add the partition manually. In Terminal type  codesudo tmutil setdestination -a / Volume/YourBackupVolume/code  Check your Time Machine destinations with codetmutil destinationinfo/code before and after adding the new Volume.  <comment359236> Thank you, that works perfectly! Question: would it also be possible to have TimeMachine apply its own encryption, when storing backups in this volume? I couldn't find out of there is an option with `tmutil setdestination` to enable encryption. This isn't really important since the partition is already encrypted by VeraCrypt, but I'm trying to fully understand how it works. <comment359238> No, TM itself does not encrypt backups on its own. It can tell hdiutil to use the command `hdiutil convert` with the argument `-encryption`. This will erase and decrypt the chosen partition. <comment359247> All clear. Thanks!
