Transfer iPhone contacts to iCloud or Mac <body> I just got involved into a new project at work, and I added all my colleagues to my iPhone contacts. In the middle of the process I got the idea it would be better to add the contacts to my iCloud.    So I got half of my colleagues in my iCloud and half of them on my iPhone memory. For some reason, the contacts I added on my iPhone, don't appear in my Address book. The ones I added on my iCloud do appear on my Mac and iPad (just like I want it to happen).  I've tried with iTunes and some 3th party software, but none of them worked (unless I paid for it... but I don't want to since I'm convinced this most basis function should work out of the box...)  So any advice how to transfer my iPhone contacts in vcf's to my Mac so I can import them into my Address book? Or how to transfer my iPhone contacts to my iCloud?  <answer52802> Try My Contacts Pro (Free). You could export all contacts on your iPhone and send them via e-mail, also could import them to your Address Book on your Mac.   <answer52933> There is a free of charge BETA tool called copytrans contacts which will help you transfer iPhone contacts to your computer. After that, import the contacts from your computer to your iCloud by logging in to iCloud on your computer and pointing to "Import".  <answer53328> Simply use kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd + kbdA/kbd to select all your "On my Mac" contacts, then drag and drop them onto your iCloud Contacts.  <answer91714> Go to you settings, select iCloud, then turn on contacts. then it should automatically update the contacts.
