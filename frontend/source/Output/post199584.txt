How to re-install OS X from single-user mode <body> So, this mac had some graphics card drivers that were potentially corrupt. After moving them out of the drivers folder, I'm able to boot in normally. However recovery boot isn't working, I can't get it to update via the App Store, I can't open Finder, nor can I do a myriad of other things. I need to re-install the OS, but can't seem to find any way of doing it... my only thought is that I could re-install it via single-user mode which is the only thing that seems to be working perfectly fine.  strongHow do I re-install my OS from single-user mode?/strong  subEDIT: Well, I found out why it wasn't booting into recovery boot: the graphics card drivers for the main system weren't working - for the same reason the drivers in the recovery partition were not working, both on the computer's harddisk, and on the recovery usb I made. After disabling (moving) the drivers on the usb, it booted to it fine. The issue is the graphics card hardware./sub  subNonetheless, I'll leave this question here since it's still a great question that deserves a good answer./sub  <comment240323> What version of osx is it? <comment240345> Did you already try to boot to Internet Recovery Mode (alt-cmd-R while booting)? Mac OS X â‰¥ 10.7 - DHCP/DNS obligatory - Ethernet recommended. <comment240595> It's OS X Lion (10.7.5) currently, but I'm attempting to upgrade it to Mountain Lion or Yosemite, both of which I have the installers for. But due to its lack of drivers, I can't even run any installers.
