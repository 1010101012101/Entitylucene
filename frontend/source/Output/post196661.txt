Is there a browser or browser extension that provides a detailed offline cache? <body> We have pretty horrible internet in our house every now and then. I was wondering if anyone knew of a browser or browser extension that provides extremely detailed caching for off-line use when the Internet is not there.   I use pocket often for a lot of my off-line endeavors but I would prefer to just have the Mac constantly saving pages off-line so I can revisit them when I don't have any Internet connection. I don't really care about how much storage gets taken up because I normally only use about a quarter of my 500 GB hard drive, since I work from home, it's much more important to me to have the sources that I have visited always available.  Up until now, I have tried my best to keep myself under best practices and save everything that I think is important but there are certain pages or things that I don't think are important that later on become important. Plus I would just like this process to be automated because I shouldn't have to constantly worry about, "what if this isn't available off-line later on?"  Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance.  <comment234976> any you found so far that did not work for you ? Like HTTrack, Wget ....ect.. <comment235014> I mean more like browsers that I can use as full on browsers but it happen to also cache it in the background. Pocket is the best that I know of so far
