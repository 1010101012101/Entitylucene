How can I transfer my application to IPad <body> I am thinking about development small applications for IPad and I'm just wondering how can I transfer my application to my IPad?  I don't have a plans to sell or to distribute my software among the other users.  All what I want is to use my app by myself.  How can I get it?  <answer80669> On a non jailbroken iPad you NEED to enroll iOS Dev Program, which cost 99$/Year and then use Xcode.  Cf : https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/  There may be other frameworks that work without jailbreaking and/or Xcode.
