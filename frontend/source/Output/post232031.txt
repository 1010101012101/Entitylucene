What does "slide to upgrade" do? <body> On iOS 9, after restoring from a backup, a screen comes up that says "slide to upgrade."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3q4Cm.jpg" alt="slide to upgrade"  This doesn't update your iOS firmware, right? I imagine it just prepares your backup for iOS 9. Is this correct? I have scoured Apple's support articles, Reddit, and the likes. All I can find is information about a bug related to the slide to upgrade screen.  <answer232097> If you restore, on any device that can accept that iOS, you will have to update too.  I imagine this is one of the reasons why 'they' say not to restore a jailbroken phone [not that I've ever had one].    I've never actually seen the Slide to Upgrade, as I don't do upgrades/restores OTA, always connected to iTunes, but on iTunes it wants to fetch the update before it will let you do anything else at all.  The only exception would be an iPhone 4, etc, which has reached end of life.  Following comments that you can revert to an earlier version by downloading the .ipsw file - this is always going to be the case for a few weeks after an update, but will always timeout &amp; leave an upgrade as the only alternative most of the time - research shows me that indeed today is that day (6 April 2016) for 9.2.1 - Following release of iOS 9.3 &amp; 9.3.1, Apple stops signing iOS 9.2.1  <answer247498> I just bought an iPhone SE. It came pre-installed with iOS 9.3.2. I set it up from an iPhone 5s iOS 8.1 iTunes backup. When the restore was complete, I was greeted with the "slide to upgrade" message. I slid it, and a loading bar with the Apple logo was displayed. When it was finished loading, a message appeared saying "upgrade complete." When the setup was finished, I went into Settings; it was still on iOS 9.3.2. It is now asking me to update to iOS 9.3.3.  Thus, "slide to upgrade" does strongemnot/em/strong update your iOS firmware to the latest version, it likely just prepares the old backup data for use with with iOS 9.  <comment283497> I'm actually not entirely sure. I went from a iPhone 4s running iOS 7 (and backups of that) to an iPhone 5s running iOS 8, and it forced me to upgrade to iOS 9. I would be wary, as you may find yourself suddenly running a version of iOS you didn't expect to. I'm not adding this as an answer as I don't really know, and this is just speculation based on my personal experience. <comment283607> Apple is still signing iOS 9.2.1. If I restore to iOS 9.2.1 right now and use a backup, is it going to try to update it to iOS 9.3? Maybe someone that doesn't have anything to lose should try it out. I'm really asking this question to be able to answer this other question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231921/restoring-ipod-touch-forces-update <comment283611> I'm pretty sure the restore will force you to upgrade. I don't have a disposable device to test on, I'm afraid. <comment283617> Neither do I, otherwise I'd do it, too. <comment285927> you can go to 9.2.1 if you download the package and install from backup <comment285932> This is always going to be the case for a few weeks after an update, but will always timeout & leave an upgrade as the only alternative most of the time. & research shows me that indeed today is that day for 9.2.1 - [Following release of iOS 9.3 & 9.3.1, Apple stops signing iOS 9.2.1](http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/05/apple-stops-signing-ios-9-2-1/) <comment288944> Have you called Apple?
