OS X Lion Password Changed, What should I do? <body> I have a MacBook Pro running OS X Lion. This morning when I turned my machine on I went to log in and my password was incorrect. This frequently happens because of spelling mistakes, caps lock is on, or I'm rushing. After trying my password about 20 times it still wouldn't work.    I am certain my password changed overnight.  I used my Apple ID to create a new one.  Has anyone experienced this before? Does this warrant a reinstall?  What measures should I take?    I searched Google for malicious processes that I should be looking out for. I could not find a comprehensive list. How serious is this? I changed my password; is that sufficient?  <comment41045> I've experienced this before. Somehow the keyboard layout was reset to English. But I have a German keyboard. Thus, I enabled to show the input menu on the login window (system prefs-users&groups-login options). But you're American right?  My kind of problem shouldn't have affected yours. <comment41049> @gentmatt, well this is a little reassuring, I was hoping it was something like this, where apple just reset some sort of configuration option. <comment41067> *What* / *Who* could have changed your password settings overnight? Who had access to your previous password? <comment41117> There is a fairly simple way to force a password change through the console using a boot device (I'm not sure if the recovery mode on Lion is the same but I can't see why not). I would go this route to reset the password.
