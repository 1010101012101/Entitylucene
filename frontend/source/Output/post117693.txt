Unable to install R-2.11.1.pkg and up to R-3.0.2 in Mac OSX 10.8.5 <body> I have an iMac 2013 with a Fusion Drive and OSX 10.8.5. No plans to migrate to Mavericks yet.  I have had issues also with x11 that I've solved with a "direct" install:  precodeinstaller -pkg ~/Desktop/XQuartz.pkg -target / -allowUntrusted -store /code/pre  But, when I try to install R-2.11.1 and above (I'm using R-2.10.1, and works well ;) ) I get the following message from the installer:  precodeR 3.0.2 for Mac OS X 10.6 or higher (Snow Leopard build) can't be installed on this disk. This build of R requires MAC OS X 10.6 or higher. /code/pre  If I try from the Terminal  precodesudo installer -pkg ~/Desktop/R-3.0.2.pkg -target / -allowUntrusted -store /code/pre  I receive this output from terminal:  precodeinstaller: Note: running installer as an admin user (instead of root) gives better Mac App Store fidelity installer: Warning: R-3.0.2.pkg was signed with a certificate that is not valid for store submission. installer: Installation Check: Passed installer: Volume Check: Fatal: Failure /code/pre  And it fails.  What can I do? Delete some plist? Regenerate something? Reinstall Mountain Lion? I really prefer to not to have to rebuild from source.  I have had no issues installing R on my notebook with Lion.  <answer117694> Why are you using the code-store/code option? You realise that if you have that then code-allowUntrusted/code is ignored. To quote the man page codeIn this mode, no other options are supported/code. That option is there to check that a package is ready to be submitted to Apple for the App Store.  Take that out.   I also discovered that failed attempts seem to leave orphan installer processes running that seem to cause trouble in later attempts - even a codekill -9/code leaves them on the process stack.  Reboot your computer and then run Terminal. First go codesudo -s/code so you get an actual root shell. Now codeinstaller -verbose -pkg ~/Desktop/R-3.0.2.pkg -target //code in the root shell. Thats what worked for me under 10.9  <answer118596> Tried also "more options in installer" also to N/A. Did not tried Sage.  Then I tried with the re-installation of OSX 10.8.5 (Cmd-R), and then I've installed R3.0.2 without issues.  <comment137453> It's a little hard in your question to parse out what you are typing and the errors that are returned. Could you make it a little clearer please. <comment137487> Hi Tony, just re-did this  sudo installer -pkg ~/Desktop/R-3.0.2.pkg -target /  The answer is always the same:  installer: Cannot install on volume / because it is disabled. installer: This build of R requires Mac OS X 10.6 or higher.  ... <comment137497> Added to the answer after doing some exploration. <comment137552> Tony, thanks a lot, but still does not work. I did :  sudo -s and bash told me: bash-3.2# (root ok)  then I did:  installer -verbose -pkg ~/Desktop/R-3.0.2.pkg -target /   and then the answer is always the same:   installer: Cannot install on volume / because it is disabled. installer: This build of R requires Mac OS X 10.6 or higher. <comment137553> Dang. Might be a 10.8 problem as it went in fine under 10.9  It's possible all your failed attempts have left too much cruft around. At what point did it fail - what was the verbose output you got? <comment137554> and not, is a (not so well) known problem. There is a solution for x11 (that I've applied) and then I go back to my original question: What can I do? Delete some plist? Regenerate something? Reinstall Mountain Lion? I really prefer to not to have to rebuild from source, but if rebuilding from source is the only option I should go there ... <comment137555> verbose output: installer: Cannot install on volume / because it is disabled. installer: This build of R requires Mac OS X 10.6 or higher. <comment137556> It is at this point that I would scrape and re-image the computer. Go right back to a clean install of the OS and test from there. You could also sidestep the entire problem and try a SAGE install :- http://www.sagemath.org/ it will give you R 3.0.2.
