MacOS: Troubleshooting Apple File System Events <body> I have a suspicion that I am having problems with Apple File System Events. It may be that this is resulting in issues with my Time Machine backup.  My logs do include messages such as codeNot using file event preflight/code, which I understand has something to do with FSEvents.  How can I troubleshoot FSEvents. Is there anything I can do to repair the process, if thereâ€™s something wrong?
