Disable notification center on lock screen (or prevent it from clearing notifications) <body> One of the must utterly eminfuriating/em problems I have on recent iOS versions is the fact that swiping down from the top of the screen while the phone is locked will bring down the notification center and emclear/em all of my lock screen notifications.  This happens all. the. time. I usually keep my phone in my pocket, and if I get a message or feel it vibrate, I will reach into my pocket and with my thumb and forefinger pull it out. Perhaps 50% of the time when I do this, my thumb ends up pulling the notification center down when I pull my phone out.  This alone isn't a big deal, I can just swipe it up again. The emproblem/em is that when the notification center comes down, for some god-knows-why reason, it clears the notifications that were just on the screen, meaning I'm now prevented from doing precisely what I pulled the phone out of my pocket for in the first place.  There has got to be a way to fix this horrible UX.  <answer222732> Naturally, I ended up solving this shortly after I posted the question. This article ended up solving it for me.  In summary:  ol liOpen Settings/li liGo to Touch ID &amp; Passcode/li li(Enter passcode)/li liScroll down to "Allow Access When Locked"/li liDisable emboth/em "Today" and "Notifications View"/li /ol  Now there is no swiping down from the top at all on the lock screen (but still available if unlocked). Thank goodness!
