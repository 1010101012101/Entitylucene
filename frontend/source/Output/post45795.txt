How to remove media files from an iPhone <body> I converted a few videos to m4v format using Handbrake and then transfered them to the iPhone through iTunes (Drag'n dropped them directly from Handbrake's output folder to the iPhone block in iTunes left column)  The problem is the files don't appear on the iphone. I looked for them in the iPod/Music app, in the video App, iTunes U ..  Nowhere to be found  But when i search for them (Left swipe search panel on the iPhone's front screen) they show up in the results  But when i click on one, the video App is launched and quickly disapears. As if it was an unsupported format.  I then imported those same files (from Handbrake's output folder) to iTunes and organised them (Right click  more info and filled a few fields in the Info tab, added an illustration photo etc..) then passed them to the iPhone and everything was fine.  The problem is the old untagged files are still on the iphone as well. I find them when i connect the iPhone to the mac and search using applications like DeTune or iPhone Explorer  I want to delete them from the iPhone but i'm thinking it may mess things up since they must be logged in some sort of database file in the iphone's music app.  So do you think it is safe to just delete them from a desktop app like iPhone Explorer ?  Thanks  <comment52190> Why can't you just delete them with iTunes? <comment52199> They don't show up on iTunes.   The only way I can locate them is when i plug the iPhone to the desktop and browse its memory using apps like iPhone Explorer and/or DeTune <comment52269> So they don't show up on Mac iTunes in the same place you imported them? <comment54931> Hi, Sorry for the late reply. No they don't show up on Mac iTunes. I deleted the files using iPhone explorer. Everything's been fine .. so far
