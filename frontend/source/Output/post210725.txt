Using AppleScript to Send Email from Mail.app to Multiple Addresses <body> I am able to successfully send out an email with an attachment to a single email address using the code below:  precodeon run argv     set theSubject to (item 1 of argv)     set theAttachmentFile to (item 2 of argv)      tell application "Mail"          set theAddress to "recipient1@domain.com" -- the receiver          set theSignatureName to "Sig" -- the signature name           set msg to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:theSubject, visible:true}          tell msg to make new to recipient at end of every to recipient with properties {address:theAddress}         tell msg to make new attachment with properties {file name:theAttachmentFile as alias}          set message signature of msg to signature theSignatureName          send msg     end tell end run /code/pre  However, I can't figure out how to change this code to send the email to both recipient1@domain.com and recipient2@domain.com. Does anyone know how I would go about doing so? I'm very new to AppleScript, so I'd greatly appreciate the help!  <answer210732> I was able to tweak the codeset theAddress/code line and the codetell msg to make new to recipient/code line to make the following code run as intended:  precodeon run argv     set theSubject to (item 1 of argv)     set theAttachmentFile to (item 2 of argv)      tell application "Mail"          set theAddress to {"recipient1@domain.com","recipient2@domain.com"}          set theSignatureName to "Sig" -- the signature name           set msg to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:theSubject, visible:true}          tell msg             repeat with i from 1 to count theAddress                 make new to recipient at end of every to recipient with properties {address:item i of theAddress}             end repeat         end tell         tell msg to make new attachment with properties {file name:theAttachmentFile as alias}          set message signature of msg to signature theSignatureName          send msg     end tell end run /code/pre  <comment349751> Do you think that it is possible to set the list of email addresses from a txt file?
