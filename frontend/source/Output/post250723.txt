Adjust width of spacer between Mac OS dock icons <body> Many of you might know that it is possible to add a spacer to the Mac OS dock icons with:  precode$ defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}' $ killall Dock /code/pre  but the problem is, I find them a bit wide by default. I do understand the size of the space is the same as an actual icon but I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to adjust the space of those emspacers/em  An image of the spacers I'm talking about can be found here  <answer250727> I held the same belief, that the spaces were too big. I've researched this rather extensively, and found no way to lessen the gap.  I went in another direction - adding a vertical line instead of a space.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cWH5y.png" alt="vertical line"  To do this, I created an app in Automator that simply launches the Finder. I called them line1.app and line2.app (for however many lines you want, you need to create a different app).  If you've never used Automator, here is a simple way to create the apps I mentioned.  hr  strongUsing Automator to Create an App/strong  ol liOpen Automator. /li liSelect "New Document" in the lower left./li liChoose a type for your document - Application./li liFind "Launch Application" from the list, and drag it into the workspace on the right. /li liSelect the Finder app. To do this, you have to go down to "New Variable."

It's surprising that there does not seem to be a CLI way to adjust the size of spacers / icons. Anyway I really like your alternative workaround, I think I will give it a try. <comment311462> There might be... I just haven't found it yet. Maybe someone else has another idea! <comment311469> Are you certain it makes the gap narrower? Or is it just the perception, created by the line? It would feel unlikely that anything other than 'the same gap for every app, inc spaces' would be possible. [forget that, I just re-read your answer... my bad. No narrower, just a perceptual difference] <comment311479> Wow, fancy. [more chars]
