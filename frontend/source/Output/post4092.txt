Run Command Line Script from Finder's contextual menu <body> I have a shell script that deletes exif data from images.  I would like to right-click the folder with the images and execute the command from the context menu.br / How can I do this?  The Shell script is:  precodeexiftool -all= -overwrite_original test /code/pre  where test is the dir with the images  <answer4098> If you're using Snow Leopard, you can create a Service, and it'll show up in a submenu of the contextual menu (as well as in the Services submenu of the Finder menu).  To do this:  ol liRun /Applications/Automator.app/li liChoose the Service template/li liSet the Service Receives Selected pop-up (above the workflow column on the right) to "Files and Folders"/li liFind the Run Shell Script action in the second column (the search field at the top can help), and drag it to the workflow column/li liSet the action's Pass input: pop-up to "as arguments"/li liIn the template script that appears, replace codeecho "$f"/code with codeexiftool -all= -overwrite_original "$f"/code -- the script should now look like this:  precodefor f in "$@" do     exiftool -all= -overwrite_original "$f" done /code/pre/li liSave the Service with some descriptive name/li /ol  <comment3922> Excellent, thanks. I just wanted to add that in step #3, "Files and Folders" in "Finder.app" I also skipped the loop with [exiftool -all= -overwrite_original "$@"] <comment3933> For some reason, it didn't occur to me that `exiftool` might be able to take multiple files & folders.  As for step 3, restricting the service to Finder.app doesn't really matter -- what other app do you select files & folders in?  BTW, one limitation of this is that the Run Shell Script action doesn't do a very good job of error reporting, so if anything can go wrong, the script should take care of its own reporting.
