Multimedia USB device noise <body> I'm using a USB device that combines a few inputs(optical, USB, 3.5mm) and outputs them to one 3.5mm port. After outputting my MacBook Pro sound to the device through USB for a few minutes there appears noise and not long later it becomes so unbearable that I have to pause the media. That cycles every 3-5 minutes provided that I output it through USB. If I output through the 3.5mm jack, however, everything is smooth. I tried using the device on a Windows computer and outputting through USB worked fine. I also recorded the outputted audio(screenFlow) and there was no noise there.  <answer244735> Sounds like a problem with the audio format. Open the strongAudio MIDI Setup/strong application, select your USB device, and try different combinations for audio format (sampling rate, channel/bit-depth).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NKzyD.png" alt="audio format settings"  If your device is locked at a sample rate and/or bit-depth, this should be a workaround. Try creating a strongMulti-Output Device/strong with your device and the strongBuilt-in Output/strong. (note: with the multi-output, you will have to set the volume on each device individually)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yy9Gm.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol liClick the kbd+/kbd icon at the bottom left and select strongCreate Multi-Output Device/strong./li liUnder the "use" column, select strongBuilt-in Output/strong and your device./li liSet the strongMaster Device/strong to Built-in Output. This will allow you to choose different sample rates based on what is allowed for Built-in Output./li liLower the volume on Built-in Output (essentially muting it so sound only goes through your device)/li liRight-click on your device emunder the Multi-Output Device/em and check strongResample this subdevice/strong./li liIn System Preferences  Sound, change the output device to the Multi-Output Device./li /ol  Now you can change the sample rate of the multi-output device.  <comment301619> To clarify, the noise is coming from speakers connected to the USB adapter? And you can only hear it if audio media is playing? <comment301623> I connect headphones, not speakers, to the USB adapter but I've used the headphones without the USB device, through the 3.5mm port and they've worked fine. Yes, it is only heard if media is playing. <comment301626> Could you provide a product link to the USB adapter you are using? <comment301627> http://www.astrogaming.com/mixampâ„¢-pro-tr/MixAmp-TR.html <comment301629> Thanks. Is it the same problem for any media? ex. iTunes music, YouTube, video games <comment301630> The problem has been appearing mainly in iTunes music. Other media like VLC or YouTube has been working fine. <comment301644> The Audio MIDI Setup didn't provide different formats - just 48000.0 Hz and 2ch-16bit Integer. <comment301648> Updated answer with a workaround. <comment301651> I tried changing the sample rate through your workaround, however the noise still appears. It seems like it takes longer but it definitely is still there. <comment301660> Looks like we're heading in the right direction. Which sample rate(s) seemed to lessen the noise? <comment301661> 48000.0 Hz seemed the longest until noise appeared. <comment304686> Not sure if you still have this problem, but I just ran into [this question on headphone jack noise](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/8039/178068). See if any of these answers work.
