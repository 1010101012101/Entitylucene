'Loading iTunes Match' always shows when I start Music on my iPhone <body> A few months ago I was having problems downloading songs from iCloud, I could play them fine, but just couldn't download them for off-line access.  I spoke to Apple support, and they advised me to 'reset all settings' on my iPhone, which I did, then it all started working again, after re-logging in to my iTunes Match account.   However, since then, every time I start 'Music' it briefly shows the playlist I was last on, then shows the 'Loading iTunes Match' screen.   This takes a few minutes, and if I close Music, and re-open it, it does it again.  If I just try to play music from the Lock screen or my pressing the button on my headphones it plays fine, it just seems to be the application that's broken.  <comment135181> I've spoken to Apple support about this issue, and the guy I spoke to said that it was 'by design' and that it's quite acceptable to wait for 3 minutes for the iPhone to 'Load iTunes Match' - he kept going on about my internet connection etc.. Incidentally, this is EVERY time I start 'music'..
