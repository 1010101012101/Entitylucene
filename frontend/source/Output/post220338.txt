Can I find information on whether the iMac with 250GB, 500GB, or 1TB of SSD storage differ in speed? <body> Apple doesn't say in their order or specs page, but I am wondering if there is any info on the iMac 27 Retina model, if the 250GB, 500GB, or 1TB SSD hard drive differ in speed?    Such as the speed of the 500GB is faster than the 250GB model, or if the 1TB is done by RAID 0 (striping) and so the speed can be up to double the speed of 500GB?
