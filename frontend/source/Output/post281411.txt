Any way to restart LogMeIn Hamachi on a remote machine? <body> LogMeIn Hamachi is crashing on a remote Mac, and I need to restart it without restarting the machine (because then I would lose access entirely.)  I tried un/re-loading the global agent/daemons:  ul licode/Library/Application Support/LogMeIn Hamachi/bin/hamachid/code/li licode/Applications/LogMeIn Hamachi/LogMeIn Hamachi Menubar.app/Contents/MacOS/LogMeIn Hamachi Menubar/code /li /ul  but it still fails. App keeps launching and crashing.  <answer281413> Solution: I simply uninstalled and re-installed.
