Sort smart playlist for iPod Nano? <body> I have an iPod Nano 7th Generation and a MacBook Pro running Mac OS 10.11.6 and iTunes 12.5.1.21.  When I sync a smart playlist to the iPod, the play order is not preserved.  Instead the playlist contents all appear shuffled.  In older versions of iTunes (e.g. on Mac OS Lion), the play order was very clear in iTunes and synced so it would play in order.  How can I get this orderly behavior with my iPod and iTunes?  hr  (Note: This may affect standard playlists also, but I haven't attempted to sync any of those.)
