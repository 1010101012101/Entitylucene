How do I tell if there is an iPhone backup in my iCloud account without the iPhone <body> A couple of months ago I had an iPhone.  That iPhone was never connected to iTunes. It was configured to make backups to iCloud. It was stolen.  Now I'm getting another, used iPhone from a family member. It would be nice if I could restore the backup of my previous iPhone to the newer iPhone.  But since I no longer have my previous iPhone, I don't know if there still is a backup to restore. If there is none, I don't want to reset the new iPhone.  Is there a way to tell if the backup is still in my iCloud account?  <answer148647> Simply log in into iCloud Control Panel on your Mac or PC (using your Apple ID and password) and press [Storage]; you will see the list of available devices/backups on the account:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mt8Uu.png" alt="iCLoud backups"
