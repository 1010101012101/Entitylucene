How to see iCloud photo size? <body> I'm currently in the process of downloading my pictures from iCloud to my iPhone. I've backed up all my photos on my computer, so I've deleted most of them from my iCloud library. I have little over 300 photos (no videos) left- however, iCloud always gives me an error when I attempt to turn iCloud photo backup off.   No matter how much space I have on my device, it claims that I need an extra ___mb to save the photos. However, those alerts seem to be a bit unreliable- after deleting a 400mb app, the alert claimed that I needed 358 more mb's to save all my photos (Before deleting it, it said I needed 400 more mb's).   I'm not sure where the issue lies, and I'd like to check the size of each of my photos, to see what's causing the issue. It certainly shouldn't be like this- I have well over 1gb free, and 300 pictures should fit into that space with room to spare.   <answer261114> In this case, you'd better free up iCloud storage space (not just iCloud Photos) by deleting unnecessary files in the Cloud:  ul liLaunch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad./li liScroll down and tap on iCloud./li liChoose Storage &amp; Backup./li liTap on Manage Storage./li liTap on the app you want to manage./li liSwipe from right left to reveal the red Delete button on any item. (Or tap Edit at the top right to make multiple selection)./li liTap to confirm./li /ul
