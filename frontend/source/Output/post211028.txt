Any OSX tool to batch remove (or convert) embedded album artwork in MP3 files? <body> my car audio system does not support MP3 album artworks embedded in PNG format.. unfortunately iTunes switched to this format a while ago.  I'd need to find a way to remove (or convert to JPG) all artwork data in PNG from a big set of files and directories.   Is there any tool that can do that in batch?  I've seen some CLI tools like EyeD3 or id3v2 but seems they require some compilation steps or Python install... too complicated for me...   I'm using some of Dougscripts plugins for copying files to the SD card, but there's no tool working on PNG album artwork.  Thanks!!. L.  <answer211032> Maybe Tagger can do this for you.  <answer248165> If you are comfortable with a command line tool, ffmpeg can convert one file at a time. However, for the batch processing, some shell programming will be required. Disclaimer: ffmpeg asks before overwriting, but before processing your mp3 collection with a self written bash script, better backup your data.  This post on stackoverflow is related.  You pass the input file to ffmpeg with the -i option, specify the codecs for video ('none' or 'mjpeg' in this case) and audio ('copy' in this case)  Converting:  precodeffmpeg -i song_with_any_artwork.mp3 -c:v mjpeg -c:a copy song_with_mjpeg_artwork.mp3 /code/pre  Removing:  precodeffmpeg -i song_with_artwork.mp3 -vn -c:a copy song_only.mp3 /code/pre  <answer276804> You can use codeid3v2/code to remove all artwork from your mp3 files.
