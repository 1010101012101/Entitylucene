MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch) El Capitan <body> I have a Macbook Pro Retina 13 inch.  I have recently lost my notifications in the notification centre. The " today" tab functions but my "notifications" bar has nothing. The banners from notifications pop up but they are not saved in the "notifications" tab. I have attempted killing and restarting the notifications centre through Terminal but to no avail. Please help! TIA  <answer239057> Check in your emSystem settings  Notifications/em on the left side on the Panel if strongDo to disturbed/strong is in any way activated. Also check from which app you need Notifications and activate it.   Also you should look in the settings of emSecurity  Privacy/em if Notifications from your apps are disabled.
