Make and create Live USB Linux for Mac? How? <body> I'm wanting to create a live usb linux so I can easily access it everytime when I need it without taking up any space. But with other sources, they say to rEFInd and I did so, however when restarting and accessing the boot menu, nothing happens.  I am running Yosemite 10.10 on a Macbook Pro - I still have rEFInd on my mac.  I already have .iso version of the linux and UnetBootin  strongAny way how to make a live usb linux on a Yosemite Macbook Pro?/strong  <answer153975> ol liDownload the desired .img file/li liOpen a Terminal (under Utilities) ul liIf you have and .iso file, you could convert to .img with the command codehdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/source.iso/code./li /ul/li liRun codediskutil list/code to get the current list of devices/li liInsert your flash media/li liRun codediskutil list/code again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. code/dev/disk2/code)/li liRun codediskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN/code/li liExecute codesudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/diskN bs=1m/code/li liRun codediskutil eject /dev/diskN/code and remove your flash media when the command completes/li /ol  Restart your Mac and press kbd&#x2325;/kbd/kbdâŒ˜/kbd key while the Mac is restarting to choose the USB stick.  <comment181384> there's only a .iso file - I'm trying to get Kali Linux running from a usb **|** Will running terminal do the same to .iso instead of .img? _if this works i'll wont need rEFInd from now on_ <comment181386> Updated my previous answer. <comment181541> Ok i'll try tonight when I get back home/to boarding house. But thanks for the answer! <comment181640> sorry, it turned out I was hesitant and the downloads page on Kali **did** provide an image file, but when I downloaded it, it downloaded something like "kaillinux.img.xz" what was the .xz ? I renamed it to .img then put it through terminal and after giving it permission, it "did" nothing. typing anything gives it no response. <comment181641> Must be a tar.xz. To uncompress use `tar xvfJ kaillinux.img.xz`. <comment181642> I forget to mention, there was two versions of the downloads, ARMEL and ARMHF - which versions do I use? <comment181643> tar xvfj doesn't work on .img.xz - it said `tar xvfj /Users/__________/Downloads/kali-linux-1.0.9a-armel.img.xz  tar: Unrecognized archive format tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.` this is the same with armhf <comment181644> Images are for ARM and you can't use it. You have to use `Kali Linux 64 bit ISO`. Anyway, you could convert the iso downloaded to img as I told you in the answer, with `hdiutil` command. <comment181646> `hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/Downloads/kali-linux-1.0.9a-amd64.img ~/Downloads/kali-linux-1.0.9a-amd64.iso ` response: `hdiutil: convert failed - image not recognized` <comment181647> Maybe your file is corrupted. [Kali docs](http://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-dual-boot-on-mac-hardware) says that you must only copy the iso file to your usb drive. Did you tried it? <comment181665> I've moved the .iso file to a 32Gb journaled mac usb - tried the hdutil still came up with image not recognized - how about I will look up online on how to .iso to .img <comment247307> Sometimes there are tar.xz files but this is not a tar only an xz. To unzip an xz file: `unxz ~/Downloads/kali-linux-1.0.9a-armel.img.xz ~/Downloads/kali-linux-1.0.9a-armel.img` or you could use: `xz -dc ~/Downloads/kali-linux-1.0.9a-armel.img.xz ~/Downloads/kali-linux-1.0.9a-armel.img`
