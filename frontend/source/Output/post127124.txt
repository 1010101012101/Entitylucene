Graphical man pages viewer in Terminal.app <body> There is a feature in terminal to view man-page of selected string in external window with strong⌃⌘?/strong shortcut.   But it has a priority to display preinstalled man pages. So for example I've installed gnu coreutils with homebrew and have edited man-pages search path. And if I do codeman ls/code in console I get man-page from gnu coreutils but help menu action gives me bsd man-page.   Is it possible to fix man-pages search path for it?  <answer129563> Instead of that you can use Dash. It is an application for having and reading different programming languages docsets offline. It also has the ability to read the man pages available on your system.  <comment151635> Try running `which man`. Mine is `/usr/bin/man` but yours may have changed by the installation of the GNU coreutils.
