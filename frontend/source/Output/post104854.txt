AppleScript: Find all instances of "Folder" and list the contents in a drop down box/list <body> I'm trying to make a script I can use to find all instances of a folder, be it on the root drive, external drive or mounted networked storage, and list all the contents in either a drop down box or a selectable list in a dialogue window.  To pseudo-code it:  precodetell application "Finder"     for (every instance of "*/Folder"         append items in "*/Folder" to contentsList     end for end tell /code/pre  I honestly have no idea how to actually do it in AppleScript since it doesn't natively have for loops, and I'm not sure about adding items to arrays in AppleScript.  Is anyone able to give me any pointers? Alternatively, being able to do the same in a shell script would be just as good.  Thanks in advance!  <answer104855> With codebash/code you can do something like  precodefor dir in $(find ~ -type d -name 'Folder' -print); do     echo $dir     ls -al "$dir"     echo done /code/pre  <answer104862> precodeset l to {} tell application "Finder"     repeat with f in (folders of entire contents of (POSIX file "/Users/username/" as alias) where name is "Folder") as alias list         repeat with i in (get items of f)             set end of l to POSIX path of (i as alias)         end repeat     end repeat end tell choose from list l /code/pre    precodefind ~ -name Folder -exec ls {} + /code/pre    precodeshopt -s globstar # bash 4.0 or later printf %s\\n ~/**/Folder/* /code/pre    precodemdfind 'kMDItemContentType==public.folder&amp;&amp;kMDItemFSName==Folder' -onlyin ~ | while IFS= read -r l; do ls "$l"; done /code/pre  <comment123364> Which real-world problem are you trying to solve here? There may be better ways to solve it than to recursively traverse through the whole filesystem with AppleScript. <comment123367> In this case, it is for finding /Users/ folders on any and all connected filesystems and listing the names of the home folders inside them. Definitely, if there is a better way, I want to know about it!
