Apple Watch unlock feature for macOS Sierra requires turning off 2-step-verification <body> Yesterday I installed macOS Sierra and now I want to enable this new feature - unlocking MacBook with Apple Watch.  I opened codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code settings and tried to check this option (codeAllow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac/code). It asked me for my strongiCloud/strong (strongApple ID/strong) password, I provided it, but then it showed me the following message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1HwDo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Some additional info (if it's relevant):  ul liMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)/li limacOS Sierra 10.12/li liBluetooth LMP Version: 4.2 (0x8)/li /ul  And yes, I have two-step verification enabled in my strongApple ID/strong for about a year now:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eifhT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So, to have this feature enabled I need to reduce protection of the entire strongApple ID/strong? Can I bypass this requirement and use the watch to unlock my Mac?  <answer253787> No - Apple's code to perform the unlock explicitly doesn't support two factor. I was willing to change my security, but understand your concerns.  The workaround would be to use a third party unlock service like https://www.macid.co and use their software to unlock your computer.  Sadly, I don't think their implementation is as efficient, reliable or secure as Apple's so I'm making the change Apple asked. My speculation is two-step will be shut off within a year and that two-factor will become more secure than it is today. Those are guesses and opinion, though.  <answer253799> You need to strongdisable/strong emtwo-step verification/em and strongenable/strong emtwo-factor authentication/em.  If you follow the steps in this article, it will show you how you can use your Watch to wake-up your Mac.  One of the key parts is at the bottom of the article:     For those of you using the original strongTwo-Step Verification/strong instead of the strongTwo-Factor Authentication/strong feature introduced with iOS 10, you will need to disable Two-Step Verification on the Apple ID management site and then enable Two-Factor Authentication on an iOS device. A passcode also needs to be established on the Apple Watch.    <comment315855> I'm going to edit the why and focus on the existence of any workarounds. Someone will clearly answer your post with - "No - there isn't a workaround" so be open to that possibility. <comment315856> Make sure you review [this recent article](http://www.macrumors.com/how-to/macos-sierra-apple-watch-unlock/) on how to unlock your Mac with your Watch.  It might answer your questions. <comment315858> Great question, by the way - I sure hope I'm wrong and there are options. Even if it's a deep dive into how this works and it's fragile or hacky - I'd love to learn more about how we can customize Apple's hardware even if their software wants you to follow the pack with their mainstream options. <comment315862> I think you need to disable 'two-step verification' and use 'two-factor authentication', instead. <comment315879> @fbara you are right. I did not know, that Apple introduced two-FACTOR authentication after having two-STEP verification. I switched to it and everything's fine now. You can write this as an answer. <comment315883> ...and restored initial wording in my question, because the entire point was missing <comment350132> What's the difference between Two-Step Verification and Two-Factor Verification?
