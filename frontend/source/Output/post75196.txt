How to fix contacts being read-only? <body> My Contacts (accessible via Mail or the Contacts applications) are read-only on my Mac Book Pro running Mac OS X 10.8.2. Contacts reports itself as Version 7.1 (1167).  I have 5 total contacts currently, including Apple and "Me". Not sure what I did to add the other 3, but they cannot be modified or deleted, nor can I add any new ones.  If I add or edit a contact it behaves normally, until I close Contacts. When I reopen it then all the changes are gone.  I thought maybe the contacts folder was read-only in my Library, and thought I double checked that, but maybe I missed something.  The interesting thing is both the "On My Mac" and "iCloud" contacts are read-only.  <answer75331> It looks like there is, as you mention, a file permission problem, or maybe the Contacts database is corrupt.  In either case, try rebuilding the database:  ol liOpen Contacts and export your contacts with codeFile&gt;Export...&gt;Contacts Archive.../code./li liQuit Contacts./li liOpen code~/Library/Application Support//code in the Finder (you will need to switch to the Finder, press kbdShift/kbdkbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdG/kbd, type code~/Library/Application Support/code and press kbdEnter/kbd)./li liRename code~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/code to code~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook.bak/code./li liStart Contacts. You will notice that there are only two contacts: Apple and you. Delete them./li liImport the previously exported contacts with codeFile&gt;Import.../code./li /ol  <comment87361> Have you tried repairing permissions of your startup Volume with Disk Utility? You can also export the contacts with FileExport...Contacts Archive..., quit Contacts, rename ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook, start Contacts (with will only include Apple and you) and import the exported contacts. <comment87478> I'm glad it worked. I expanded my comment to an answer as you suggested, see below. <comment87547> @jaume Thanks, deleting my comments here. <comment87548> Worked, thanks!
