Identify which folder on mail server is currently designated by Mail.app as Drafts, Junk, Trash, Sent, Archive <body> In Mail.app on El Capitan, the Mailbox menu offers the menu item codeUse this mailbox as/code. A submenu offers the items codeDrafts Mailbox/code, codeSent Mailbox/code, codeJunk Mailbox/code, codeTrash Mailbox/code, and codeArchive Mailbox/code.  After using one of these commands, the selected folder disappears. That folder's name is masked, displayed under the codeDrafts/code, codeSent/code, codeJunk/code, codeTrash/code, and codeArchive/code icons at the top of the sidebar as the name of the account rather than the actual folder name.  How can I tell strongwhat is the currently designated folder/strong for each function (Drafts, Sent, Junk, Trash, and Archive)?  <answer222604> You can emread/em it with a text editor at the beginning of the file strong~/Library/Mail/V3/MailData/BackupTOC.plist/strong.   While you can read the paths of the mailboxes, you do not see, which belongs to Drafts and which to Sent, etc. On my system, the entries in the file are in the following order: Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Trash, Junk, Archive.  The mailboxes for each account are listed next to each other.   emNote: Changes to the paths in this file have no effect. You must set it within the Mail application./em
