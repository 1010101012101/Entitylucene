Unrepairable error in disk structure in Onyx <body> I've run Onyx 3.1.7 and received the following disk structure error:  precodeError: -69845: File system verify or repair failed Underlying error: 8: POSIX reports: Exec format error  The disk needs to be repaired. /code/pre  I've rebooted system in recovery mode and attempted to run the emFirst Aid/em with use of the Disk Utility, however, after rebooting and running emOnyx/em again I've arrived at the same error. The System is running on el-capitan with 500GB flash storage.  <answer249861> Have you tried booting into single user mode (hold down kbdCmd/kbd-kbdS/kbd at startup) then at the prompt executing the command codefsck -fy/code until no errors appear? When you're done, type codereboot/code at the prompt.  <answer249867> When you get a filesystem error, the escalation steps are the same in just about all cases:  ol liMake a backup and/or verify your backup is sufficient/li liBoot to another OS (Recovery HD, utility tool, internet recovery, external drive) and run Disk Utility or whatever tool to repair./li liErase the volume and set it up again./li liTest the erased volume - if it passes, reinstall the OS and restore backup. If it fails, repair the hardware./li /ol  <comment310078> While option 3 is the cheapest way to go about it you could also use a third-party disk repair tool at this point. Diskwarrior will often fix errors that the OS can't fix with the built-in tools. Though no guarantee, sometimes even third-party tools won't fix the issue then you either reformat and restore or replace the drive.
