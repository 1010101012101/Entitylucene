Is there a way to use the iTunes store without a verified address attached to your Apple ID? <body> I don't use a credit card so I haven't filled my billing details or added a card. I was doing fine until yesterday when I started getting failed logins in when trying to update apps, telling me to verify my address. I'd been using the store for almost ~3 years now and I've never had to provide these details before. I'd rather be not forced to get a credit card so if there's any way to resolve this issue without doing so id like to know.   A screenshot of the error i'm receiving  (Theres also the issue at the fact that the appstore is prompting me to enter my appleID and the password but has only provided one text field to enter both details as you can see in the screenshot)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P5DTb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
