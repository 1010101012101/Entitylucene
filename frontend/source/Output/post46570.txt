OS X equivalent of Windows keyboard commands to access in-application menus? <body> In Windows, I often use the keyboard commands to navigate through the menus in a program.  For example, in Photoshop, I can do kbdAlt/kbd+kbdF/kbd, then kbdD/kbd to quickly strongSave for Web &amp; Devices/strong.  Or kbdAlt/kbd+kbdV/kbd, then kbdD/kbd to strongClear Guides/strong.  This is great when there is no keyboard command for a menu item that I want to use, or the existing keyboard command requires too many fingers.    How can I translate this functionality to OS X (OS X 10.5.8 in case it matters)?  How can I navigation through an applications's menus using keyboard commands?  <answer46575> You can use kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdF2/kbd, which moves the focus to the  symbol in the menu bar. Then use the arrow keys to move around, or just type the start of a menu name to highlight it. With a menu name highlighted, hit kbdSpace/kbd to expand it. In an open menu, you can type the start of a menu item to highlight it. Once highlighted, press kbdSpace/kbd again to “click” it.  So, to get to “Save for Web &amp; Devices” in Photoshop, you could press kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdF2/kbd, kbdF/kbd, kbdSpace/kbd, kbdEnter/kbd, kbdS/kbd, kbd↓/kbd until you focus “Save for Web &amp; Devices”, then kbdSpace/kbd.  Of course, the built-in keyboard shortcut for that option is much easier to type: kbd⌥/kbd + kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdS/kbd.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/11TJX.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer46594> You could also assign shortcuts to AppleScripts like this with an app like Alfred or FastScripts:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)     click menu bar 1's menu bar item 3 -- usually File end tell /code/pre  They won't work in full screen though. And it's not that much faster than just using a mouse really.  You can also trigger menu items by searching after focusing the help menu with kbd⌘/kbd+kbd?/kbd.  <comment53575> Using the Mac's keyboard shortcut got a lot easier for me when I figured out what ⌥ was.  (On my MBA, it's labeled "option" on the key.) <comment53600> @KatieK I can imagine! When in doubt, you can always refer to http://mackeys.info/ ;) <comment163831> Plus one for the command-? variant (:
