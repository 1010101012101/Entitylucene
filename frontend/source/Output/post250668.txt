Error when sending POSIX file as attachment with iMessage <body> So I have this applescript that tries to grab all images from a folder and sends them to a friend through iMessage.  The folder is structure like so:  precodeDesktop   my-folder     image-1     image-2     image-2 /code/pre  The problem is that when I read all files to a variable as a string and then try to set them to a codePOSIX file/code I get the error:     Messages got an error: Canâ€™t get POSIX file   "/Users/user/Desktop/my-folder/image-name".   precodedo shell script "rm -f ~/Desktop/my-folder/.DS_Store"  tell application "System Events"     set imgs to POSIX path of disk items of folder "~/Desktop/my-folder" end tell  tell application "Messages"     set targetServiceId to id of 1st service whose service type = iMessage     set theBuddy to buddy "redacted phone#" of service id targetServiceId      repeat with img in imgs         set imageAttachment to POSIX file img # errors         send imageAttachment to theBuddy     end repeat end tell /code/pre  How can I set codeimageAttachment/code correctly to a codePOSIX file/code so that I can send it with iMessage?  <answer250676> You are running into AppleScript sandboxing. The Messages application does not have access to open that file.  The trick is to turn the paths to POSIX files outside of the tell blocks. This will let the entitlement engine pass the entitlement into the tell block so the application can open it.    This code works:  precodetell application "System Events"     set paths to POSIX path of disk items of folder "~/Desktop/my-folder" end tell  set imgs to {} repeat with f in paths     set imgs to imgs &amp; (POSIX file f) end repeat  tell application "Messages"     set targetServiceId to id of 1st service whose service type = iMessage     set theBuddy to buddy "redacted" of service id targetServiceId     repeat with img in imgs         send img to theBuddy     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment311386> Definitely works. Thank you for explaining that :)
