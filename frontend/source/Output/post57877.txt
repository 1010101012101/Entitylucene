Cannot move window <body> I install a linux (Fedora) distribution through VMWare (4.0) on Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. The the virtual machine open up at the top of the window and hide its taskbar underneath the apple task bar as shown in below image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6u9sN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now I cannot move the virtual machine window. Solution?  <answer79716> I use two workarounds in cases like this.  ol liIn the emVMWare Fusion/em strongView/strong menu, select "Full Screen". The guest OS fills the entire Mac screen, except for a emFusion/em menu bar with menus strongView/strong, strongVirtual Machine/strong, and strongWindow/strong. Then from the strongView/strong menu, select "Single Window". When the guest OS window comes back, it's shaped better to fit the host OS display./li liLog in to the guest OS, then use the guest OS's control panel for display settings to reduce the size of the guest OS's display -- say to 1024x768. Then from the emFusion/em strongView/strong menu, select "Single Window", if not already selected. The result is a guest OS window which takes up less of the host OS display. Adjust from there. /li /ol
