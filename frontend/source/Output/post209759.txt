Adding Bounce Message back to Mail in El Capitan <body> I had this bounce back feature set up in my email with this code:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Mail"         repeat with eachMessage in input             bounce eachMessage             delete eachMessage         end repeat     end tell end run /code/pre  It no longer works since the new software update...El Capitan.br Is there a change to the code stuff?  <comment281897> Applescript no longer recognises "bounce" as a command.
