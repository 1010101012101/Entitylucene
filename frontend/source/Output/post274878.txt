Bad configuration: cannot ssh <body> As described in many other posts, after upgrading to MacOS Sierra I modified the ssh config file like so:  precodeHost me HostName login.hpc.ugent.be User vscxxxxx Port 22  Host *   AddKeysToAgent yes   UseKeychain yes /code/pre  Still I get the following error:  precode$ssh -Y vscxxxxx@login.hpc.ugent.be /Users/manfredo/.ssh/config: line 8: Bad configuration option: usekeychain /Users/manfredo/.ssh/config: terminating, 1 bad configuration options /code/pre  What am I missing?  <answer274881> Just remove the codeUseKeychain yes/code line from your configuration. The update broke existing setup by removing this option.  <answer276023> If you specify code/usr/bin/ssh/code for the commands, it works. The default path in 10.12 puts code/usr/local/bin/code at the top so any other version of codessh/code will not work with that option, since it's specific to the mac system.  <comment345690> What is the output of `ssh -V` and `type ssh`? Or do you know whether you have non-system-default ssh installed? <comment345691> This is probably false, assuming we are talking the system-provided ssh. What update broke it? Or do you mean some non-Apple ssh update? I'm on up-to-date macOS and having `UseKeychain yes` or `usekeychain yes` give no errors. <comment345694> OpenSSH_7.3p1, OpenSSL 1.0.2k  26 Jan 2017 <comment345697> That actually works. I don't really know what caused it to stop working, the only thing is I updated my macport packages today. <comment359697> to add on to this, simply `nano ~/.bash_profile` then make sure `/usr/bin` is before `/usr/local/bin` if they aren't in your `$PATH` declaration at all simply add both with them in that order.  Something like `export PATH="~/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin/:$PATH` then `source ~/.bash_profile` this resolved it for me
