Add to Existing Contact from Mail.app to Contacts.app <body> I am looking for an option to add the choice "Add to Existing Contact" from the Apple Mail.app emFrom/em address field.  As you all know, we have "Copy Address, Add to VIPs, New Email, Add to Contacts, and Services" as current choices.  I am hoping that I can find a way to have an additional choice of "Add to Existing Contact" to this list - maybe listed under Services.  I know that this is a choice when you use the smart detection feature from a signature.  I also know this is an option in iOS 6. So how can I get the same functionality for From: addresses in Mail.app?  <answer89265> This is a quick look at this,. which means it can either be refined or there is a better answer.  I will assume you know how to create an automator service. So here is an image showing the setup.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7CPKO.png" alt="enter image description here"  Run Applescript 1, code: on run {input, parameters}  precode    set bigList to {}     tell application "Contacts"          repeat with i from 1 to number of items in input             set this_item to item i of input             copy name of this_item to end of bigList         end repeat     end tell     return bigList end run /code/pre  Run Applescript 2, code:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Mail"         set eachMessage to item 1 of (get selection)         set theExtractAddress to extract address from (sender of eachMessage)     end tell     tell application "Contacts"         set thisPerson to first person whose name is item 1 of input          make new email at end of emails of thisPerson with properties {label:"home", value:theExtractAddress}         save     end tell  end run /code/pre  It will ask for permission to access the Addressbook the first time you run it. And is a bit slow to return the search results. but worked in my test.  <comment104707> I do know how to do an automator service.  Thanks so much for your help.  I will try right away and let you know if it works.  THANKS! <comment104708> It worked!  This is wonderful.  Thank you.  Do you know of a way I can assign a keyboard combo to activate this script? <comment104714> read this apple tech note on how http://support.apple.com/kb/PH3957
