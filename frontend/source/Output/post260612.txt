How do I uninstall Bitdefender Endpoint Security for Mac? <body> This application is not listed in my apps, nor does it ship with an uninstaller I can locate. The support site says to contact their support team, but the product is not listed in the drop down for support requests.  Here's what I tried so far in order to get it to stop running, so I could safely delete the program from disk, but it didn't help:  ol lisudo ps aux | grep -i endpoint/li lisudo launchctl list | grep -i bitdefender/li lifor each bitdefender product listed: sudo launchctl remove /li lireboot/li /ol  The application ran again after reboot.  <answer260613> Note that if you have multiple Bitdefender products installed and you only want to remove one of them, this is not the right approach.  ol lifinder go to /Library/StartupItems, then delete Bitdefender folder/li lifinder go to /Library/LaunchDaemons, then delete com.bitdefender.* items/li lifinder go to /Library/LaunchAgents, then delete com.bitdefender.* items/li lisudo ps aux | grep -i endpoint, note process pid/li lisudo kill -9 /li lireboot/li /ol  The program no longer launches after reboot. Now clean up its files from disk:  ol lisudo rm -rf /Applications/Bitdefender/li /ol  <answer288168> I might be a bit late on this one, but the uninstall script is here:  strong/Library/Bitdefender/AVP/Uninstaller/BitdefenderforMacUninstaller.app/strong  There should be a shortcut in the applications folder too.  <comment326333> You're supposed to do it from your UTM dashboard, btw, that's what it's for. The consumer products should have an uninstaller & a user dashboard at the Sophos web site. The corporate version is all handled from the UTM.
