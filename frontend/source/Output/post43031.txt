What are the pros and cons to updating iOS with a full install via iTunes versus a delta update via the Settings app? <body> I can think of a few reasons to do it each way, but I'd like a complete list of them.  <answer43033> strongAdvantages of full install via iTunes/strong:  ul liDevice will be synced and backed up automatically during the update process/li liIf at location without Wi-Fi access (and without an unlimited data plan), won't use up (large?) portion of the monthly quota/li liDevice will be charging during the update/li /ul  strongDisadvantages of full install/strong:  ul liTethered to computer for the duration of the update (unless using Wi-Fi Sync)/li liFull update could be significantly slower due to the large upgrade file download/li /ul  strongAdvantages of delta update via Settings/strong:  ul liConvenient - no need to be tethered to a computer while updating/li liDelta updates are smaller - with potentially shorter total update time/li /ul  strongDisadvantages of delta update/strong:  ul liUsers might not back up devices if prior to running the delta update - a potential issue if the update fails/li liUpdate process might use significant portion of the device's charge on the battery, running risk of corruption if the battery dies during the update/li liIf device isn't at 50% power, the device can't be updated via the update process unless plugged in (per this article):/li /ul     To install these updates, however, you need to have at least 50   percent battery life on your device, or have it plugged into a power   source.   I'm sure this list isn't comprehensive, but it contains most of the issues that I can think of.  <answer94917> I agree guys I keep making the mistake with 64Gb Iphone 5 and Ipad Mini. I see the update in the setting and run off and do the update over wifi relying on my back up in the cloud. I forget if it fails the full backup over the air is very laborious, if it even works (especially beta) or it will be very very slow. I too would recommend full back up to your local computer via itunes and then diasble wifi/cellular and do the back up over cable through iTunes. I just need to follow my own advice...  <comment48914> The backup is, to me, the important piece of doing it via iTunes. And, I have a 64 gig iPad with a lot of ripped movies on it so backing everything up, installing the new iOS version, then restoring takes some time. A cable has been a reliable way to do it. <comment48916> @Richard, agreed - I always do a backup prior to an update, whether or not I run the full install or the delta. Would hate to reinstall from a very old (or no) backup.
