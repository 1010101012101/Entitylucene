How can I automatically mount an external HD connected via USB to Airport Time Capsule every time I connect to my LAN? <body> I make Time Machine backups on an external 2TB HD connected via USB to my Airport Time Capsule.  strongPROBLEM/strong  When I come back to home and I reconnect to my wi-fi LAN, Time Machine is not able to automatically reconnect to the backup volume (see image below).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7JVdP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongQUESTION/strong  Is there any solution to enable Time Machine to reconnect automatically to external backup volume when I come back to home? ATTENTION: I do not need a solution to auto-mount at login/reboot, but rather a solution to auto-mount when I reconnect to my LAN. Thanks.  <answer134610> Without writing you a full blown Mac App, the best I can recommend is the app MarcoPolo  As an addition/update to this, MarcoPolo is no longer maintained and the developer suggests using control plane if it is not working with your system.  <comment159738> Very interesting! Thanks. If it works, it will be useful beyond this topic.
