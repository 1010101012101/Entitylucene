How I download all my files from Drafts for iPhone? <body> I made a lot of notes in Drafts and now want to have it on my Mac.  I have access to app by PhoneView but still can't find any text files. Also tried to contact the developer - no response.  <answer108160> Directly in the page you linked it's stated:      strongFlexible Output/strong      Send tweets to Twitter, post to Facebook, compose and send email, SMS/Messages, create calendar events â€“ or save drafts to Dropbox or Evernote   So you could just send these notes of yours through email or Dropbox, for instance.   <comment126853> I want download them all at once and this seems to be impossible <comment126854> I don't want to download one by one 100+ files :/
