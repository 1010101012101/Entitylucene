Stuck on 'Preparing to partition disk' <body> When I add a new partition it gets stuck on 'Preparing to partition disk'.  The new partition is in some empty space in the middle of the disk. As a result of the partition not being there, Windows won't boot because its looking for it.  No error, nothing. Any ideas?  <answer208745> This, and other similar problems are commonly fixed with these 2 methods:  hr  h2Method 1/h2  Go to single-user mode kbdCMD/kbd+kbdS/kbd on boot). Type the following:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /code/pre  Hit enter, and then type  precodereboot /code/pre  and then press enter. Now try making your partition again.  h2Method 2/h2  If Method 1 did not work, you can boot into Recovery mode (kbdCMD/kbd+kbdR/kbd on boot), selecting disk utility, then HD and repairing disk and disk permissions. This time make your partition in Recovery rather than in normal boot  <comment251755> Unfortunately neither method had any effect. <comment251756> I shall then keep this answer here for others to learn from, and research further. Also posting a log at the time of partitiln attempt will help <comment251759> I've added the partition with GDisk. But I'm not sure what it should be called. Windows is still not loading. <comment251760> I dont think that the partition name affects it. I usually hold Option, boot from USB and then select install on partition. Bootcamp calls it BOOTCAMP. I however think thats a topic for a new question <comment251761> Maybe its because its FAT and not NTFS. <comment251762> Both work fine. If you do FAT, you will be prompted to reformat. <comment251763> So how does one fix Window's partition table? Its clearly now out of date. <comment251766> I always had issues with the USB booting into black screen rather than partition problems. Making partitions with boot camp in the first place seems a bit more convenient. Installing rEFInd also eases things. I would start with trying to boot into your bootable USB.
