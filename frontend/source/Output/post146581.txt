Am I going to have a problem with a newsstand app which contains both free and paid subscription model? <body> We have a printed magazine and we're going to publish a newsstand app for it. And we have a case which I'm not sure Apple allow us to do. Here it is:  ol liUser buys a printed issue with promocode in it/li liUser installs the app, enters promocode and downloads free e-copy of already bought magazine./li liAnother user DOES NOT buy a hard copy and want to buy the same issue in the app. He presses the button, buys it and so on.../li liAll issues must be in the same list within app./li /ol  Problem is that the same issue might be at the same time free for those who has bought a printed copy, and paid for those who has not. So questions are:  ol liDoes Apple allow such subscription model? If yes, how do I set this up in my dev account?/li liWill Apple allow using promocodes which are probably going to be supported on my back end (service or whatever)/li /ol  I have many questions more but can't start asking them because if Apple does not allow such things, all those questions will go obsolete :)
