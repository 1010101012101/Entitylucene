Drawing diagrams in Pages don't stay in place with text <body> I feel like I'm missing something, but maybe this is just a flaw in the software.   Whenever I draw diagrams in Pages, or insert images, they seem to just float there, and if I change text above, it causes the text to go past the image I inserted. For example, if I have a paragraph of text that references "the diagram below", and I add another paragraph above it, the diagram would now be above the paragraph of text because it doesn't move with the text as its editing.   <answer200182> Pages allows for several ways to insert graphics and either float them or anchor with the text.  h2Dragging in a image or object/h2  strongPress Command kbdâŒ˜/kbd as you drag and the blinking cursor will indicate the insertion point/strong  This will keep the picture relative to the text where it was inserted.  h3Working with the Inspector/h3  The settings for objects are found in the strongInspector/strong.  Stay on Page  This will anchor the image or object relative to the empage/em regardless of the text added.  Move with Text  This will allow the image to move with the emtext/em as more is added.  Essentially anchoring the image to a place in the text so that when text is added above the insertion point, the image will move down the page along with the text. hr / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gLnnO.jpg" alt="Object Placement"  <comment148209> Which version of pages are you using? <comment148211> 5.1. Apparently there's an App Store update, which I'll do now, but I doubt that'll make a difference <comment148213> Updated, and the problem is actually worse - inserting something pushes headers, text etc. out of the way which isn't what I want <comment148231> Is there such thing as place holder? <comment148234> Had a look and there doesn't seem to be, nope <comment228113> What do you get when you change the **Text Wrap** settings for the object?  These are found in the inspector under the **Arrange** tab. (Your OP does not mention any attempt to change these settings.)
