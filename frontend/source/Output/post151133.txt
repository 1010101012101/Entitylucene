Maintain allocation of windows to spaces on restart and external monitor unplugging <body> I use spaces heavily and I have my windows arranged in a particular order. If I restart every application will be launched in the same space with many empty spaces.  If I unplug my external monitor, instead of adding those spaces to the others, the windows in them get resized and dumped into the macbook screen. They may or may not go back at funny sizes when the monitor is plugged back in.  I'd like to keep windows in specific spaces regardless of what else is going on.  <answer151779> There may be other options, but I’ve enjoyed using an app called Stay, from Cordless Dog: https://cordlessdog.com/stay/.  It takes a few steps to save and edit your window arrangement, but once you set it up, Stay handles plugging/unplugging of displays pretty seamlessly.  To set it up, you "store" window(s) for the current application, or all applications. These "stored windows" are saved for your current display configuration.   I don’t use Spaces regularly, but according to the docs for Stay, if you download the app directly from the developer, instead of the Mac App Store, the app does support Spaces: https://cordlessdog.com/stay/faq/#spaces  One tip: if you want all windows for a particular app to always be the same size and position of the current window you have open, use the "Match all windows" pattern after you store the window (look up "Window Title Pattern Matching" in the website Docs).  <answer190605> After some experimentation, I've been able to keep all windows in the proper spaces across unplug/replug by adding 1 extra blank space on my laptop screen.  While plugged in to external monitor, I have #1 on monitor and #2 &amp; 3 on the laptop (call these 1a, 2a, 3a).  strong#2a is kept blank./strong    Upon unplugging, there is some merging and rearranging of the Spaces happening:     1a + 2a - strong1b/strong   em(This is why I left 2a blank)/em      3a - strong2b/strong   End result when unplugged is my original stuff which was separated is still separated, I just don't have the extra blank display.   There's probably some way to extrapolate this merging behavior with more than 3 displays.  <comment357247> Nice solution that doesn't require a new app <comment362995> One thing to note is you can more easily keep your first Space blank using Login Items and the "Assign To" option: https://superuser.com/a/1221401/454133
