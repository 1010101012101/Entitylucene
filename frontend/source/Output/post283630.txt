Downloading all photos from iCloud Photo Library without Photos app <body> I have an iCloud account with about 800 photos stored in iCloud Photo Library. I’m trying to move them to a Mac and delete them from iCloud in order to clear up space.  I tried to connect my Mac to iCloud Photo Library by going into the Photos app’s preferences; however it then asks me to upgrade to a paid iCloud storage tier because I have over 5GB worth of local images that Photos wants to sync to iCloud.  So I don't think using the Photos app is going to work for offloading pictures to a Mac.  I then logged in to the Photos app at iCloud.com. I was able to select and download individual images, but it won’t let me select more than one at a time, so I can’t download them all in bulk. Selecting the first image, holding down the kbd⇧ shift/kbd key, then selecting the last image causes only the last image to be selected.  I could click on all 800 images while holding the kbd⌘ cmd/kbd key, but that’s obviously very tedious.  What’s the most efficient way to download images from iCloud Photo Library to a Mac that can’t connect to iCloud Photo Library without upgrading to a paid plan?  <answer294276> I was able to figure out a workaround for this. It will force the underlying structure to select all of the photos on the page and allow you to click the download selected photos button. It will download them all separately as if you had selected all of the photos by hand (but without RSI).  You need to use Chrome dev tools. I am sure you can do it with other browsers, I just haven't tried.  The following steps are involved, and I would appreciate if someone can tell me how to get the "this" value for the object I need in a simpler fashion (steps 4-10).  Here's the steps:  ol liMake sure chrome dev tools is closed./li liGo to photos in iCloud, then All Photos/li liRight click any photo on the page and select Inspect./li liClick Sources tab at the top of dev tools./li liClick braces {} at bottom of the sources window to format the code./li liSearch for case m$408$0.TOGGLE (should be around line 41706)/li liSet a breakpoint on the line above which is a switch statement./li liClick on any photo in the main window./li liGo back to dev tools and see the scope window (below source for me)./li liRight click on "this" variable and choose Store as Global Variable./li liLook in the console. Should see something like temp1 which is set to this./li liRemove the breakpoint in the source window./li liClick the Resume Script Execution button in main window./li liGo to the console, and type the following and press enter:  precodetemp1.selectAll() /code/pre/li liNothing appears to have changed, but it has underneath./li liNow click the download selected items button at the top./li liYou will now see a bunch of downloads happening./li /ol  <answer294278> You can still do this using the strongPhotos/strong app.  h3Short Version/h3  You just need to connect an empty strongSystem Photo Library/strong to strongiCloud Photo Library/strong so that emnothing gets uploaded, only downloaded/em.
