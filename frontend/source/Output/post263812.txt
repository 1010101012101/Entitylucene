iTunes Tool Bar <body> On my old PC iTunes would come up with a tool bar with headings like File, Edit, Songs View ect. On my new iMac I can not find any place to get this tool bar or the information that it did display  <answer263814> All macOS apps have their menus in the Menu Bar, shown at the top of the screen. Apps in macOS don't attach their menus to a window, but instead show them here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xbbTg.png" alt=""
