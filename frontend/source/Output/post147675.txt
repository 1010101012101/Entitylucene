Internal SSD compatible? <body> Since I was not able to find it out does anyone of you know if the following INTERNAL SSD will be compatible with my MacMini Late 2012 (the cheaper one)?  Internal SSD from BestBuy  Thanks :)  <answer147683> This SSD looks like it should work fine with a Mac Mini that has a SATA connection (which your Mac Mini does). It also claims to be compatible with Mac OS X.  <comment174067> Thanks. Can you please give me an up-vote so I can up-vote your answer? <comment174068> I upvoted your question <comment174075> Gave you an uproot too, just please fix up your question. Clean up the grammar and punctuation, give the link a useful title, etc.
