3g dongle not working on el capitan <body> My 3g dongle (micromax mmx352g) is working fine in the Mavericks in my MBP but in My MAC Mini which i upgrade to el capitan GM is not working .it's not even detecting the dongle. Is there any generic script or software that detects the 3g hardware and connect it internet via apn .   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oPNGF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer211190> Following are the steps  ol liRestart Machine and press kbdCommand/kbdkbdR/kbd while booting/li liIt will take you to the Recovery Mode/li liFrom Utilities Menu open Terminal/li liIn the Terminal Window enter codecsrutil disable/code/li liThen restart/li liInstall regular EVO drivers that came with the dongle, you will be able to see the modem in emNetwork Preferences/em and might have to do configuration manually like entering *99# as number etc./li liThen restart in same mode as step 1/li liOpen Terminal and enter codecsrutil enable/code/li /ol  It will start working at step 6  <comment249665> Did you already contact the vendor regarding a driver update? <comment249667> yes,but they no longer provide support for the dongle that i have :(
