Different key-maps/bindings for in-built keyboard and Bluetooth keyboard <body> I oft have to use a Windows keyboard with my Macbook. I have two different profiles in Karabiner, but I don't want to have to keep switching between them.  How can I have different profiles apply to different keyboards strongemin Karabiner or using some other key remapping system/em/strong?  Note: If this is technically difficult, perhaps because applications might not be able to distinguish which keyboard sent a particular keystroke, a solution that worked based on detecting if an external monitor is plugged in (using an AppleScript that interacted with Karabiner, maybe) would also be acceptable.  <answer200346> You can export the relevant settings from both profiles as XML, place them in codeprivate.xml/code, and then customize them by adding the appropriate tags as described here (found through this Google Groups discussion):     You can define settings which are effective on specific [sic] device only.br   Add code&lt;device_only&gt;/code or code&lt;device_not&gt;/code to your code&lt;item&gt;/code.   <answer200389> If you only want to disable key-mapping for the internal keyboard for Apple keyboards, the GUI offers a simpler way that doesn't involve reimporting your profile and editing codeprivate.xml/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rit9M.png" alt="Internal" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NBpZe.png" alt="External"  <comment241409> Doesn't Karabiner have a way to do this in a private.xml, where you can have settings apply only to a certain device?  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osx-karabiner/LmA5Pk7_-j8 <comment241410> @TomGewecke Thanks! I see that it is well documented and had already been asked elsewhere. Hopefully someone else with Google-fu as bad as mine might at least find this question (and so find this question useful). Do you want to post your comment as an answer?
