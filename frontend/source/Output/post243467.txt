Can't log into my MacPro user account <body> I have an older Mac Pro in 10.11. After a minor update, I can no longer log into my main user account (which is a standard account) with all my files; the rotator goes indefinitely. I can log into any of the other accounts, including the Admin. I have tried safe boot, reset NVRAM, repairing with disk utility, repaired with DiskWarrior, then with Drive Genius 3, then with DiskWarrior again. I have a clone that was made before the minor update, and yet it behaves the same as the main HD. The HDs are fairly full, but there should be room enough. I was regularly logging into my user account right up to the time I did the update, and the clone shouldn't have that update.  <answer243480> This isn't a permanent solution, BUT it will let you recover your files.   ol liLogin to your Admin account/li liOpen Terminal/li liType codechmod -R 777 /Users/username//code/li liGo to the directory that your user folders are stored in (code/Users//code)/li liRetrieve any files needed just using Finder./li liDelete user account./li /ol  Or  ol liLogin to your Admin Account/li liOpen System Preferences/li liClick Users &amp; Groups/li liClick reset password on the user. /li liChange password. /li /ol
