Can I use Time Machine to restore MacBook Pro after replacing hard drive? <body> I am about to replace the hard drive in my MBP.  What I would like to ask is once I have replaced the drive can I use Time Machine to restore it back to how it was?  I have no other way to back it up.  OS X El Capitanbr MBP 13" Mid 2012br 2.5GHz i5br 4GB 1600Mhz DDR3  <answer232651> Yes, I just did the same myself last week, though I'd recommend using a cloner (like Carbon Copy Cloner).   If you are using a Time Machine backup, it would be better to install the operating system onto the drive, run all updates, then use Migration Assistant to bring all your stuff across, effectively a 'clean' install.
