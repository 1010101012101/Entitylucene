How to get Reading List items as links <body> I just have a billion items in Safari's reading list and I would like the links to all of them.  Is there a way to get all of the items in your reading list as links (maybe in a text document)?  <answer96360> I whipped up a Python script to read the plist file referenced in the question patrix mentioned in the comments.  precode#!/usr/bin/env python import plistlib from shutil import copy import subprocess import os from tempfile import gettempdir import sys import atexit  BOOKMARKS_PLIST = '~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist' bookmarksFile = os.path.expanduser(BOOKMARKS_PLIST)  # Make a copy of the bookmarks and convert it from a binary plist to text tempDirectory = gettempdir() copy(bookmarksFile, tempDirectory) bookmarksFileCopy = os.path.join(tempDirectory, os.path.basename(bookmarksFile))  def removeTempFile():     os.remove(bookmarksFileCopy)  atexit.register(removeTempFile) # Delete the temp file when the script finishes  converted = subprocess.call(['plutil', '-convert', 'xml1', bookmarksFileCopy])  if converted != 0:     print "Couldn't convert bookmarks plist from xml format"     sys.exit(converted)  plist = plistlib.readPlist(bookmarksFileCopy)  # There should only be one Reading List item, so take the first one readingList = [item for item in plist['Children'] if 'Title' in item and item['Title'] == 'com.apple.ReadingList'][0]  if 'Children' in readingList:     for item in readingList['Children']:         print item['URLString'] /code/pre  Copy and paste that into a file, name it something like codereadinglisturls.py/code. Then make it executable by running codechmod +x readinglisturls.py/code in the Terminal. Then you can run it in the Terminal and it will print out any Reading List URLs. If you want the URLs in a file, you can redirect the output to a file by running code/path/to/readinglisturls.py &gt; myfile.txt/code in the Terminal.  <answer96461> Here's a version using the Factor programming language that is a bit simpler than the Python version answered already in this post:  precode: reading-list ( -- urls )     "~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist" read-plist     "Children" of [ "Title" of "com.apple.ReadingList" = ] find nip     "Children" of [ "URLString" of ] map ; /code/pre  More information is available in this blog post.  <answer96494> Another option using the plist Ruby gem:  codesudo gem install plist;plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist|ruby -rubygems -e 'require "plist";puts Plist.parse_xml(STDIN.read)["Children"].select{|e|e["Title"]=="com.apple.ReadingList"}[0]["Children"].map{|e|e["URLString"]}'/code  Or if you don't have other bookmarks:  codedefaults read ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist | sed -En 's/^ *URLString = "(.*)";/\1/p'/code  <comment113115> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30519/devs-can-3rd-party-apps-access-safaris-reading-list <comment113125> This script is also available as a Gist on Github, if thatâ€™s useful to anyone: https://gist.github.com/robmathers/5995026 <comment113284> Is the 'reading list' plist file the same as the 'bookmarks' plist file? <comment113310> The reading list entries are stored in the bookmarks file, so yes (kind of).
