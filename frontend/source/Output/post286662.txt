iPad Pro 12.9 doesn't connect to the Mikrotik RB2011UiAS-2HnD-IN access point <body> My iPad Pro 12.9 doesn't connect to the Mikrotik access point. I also use MacBook Pro and that device doesn't have any problems. Watching at Mikrotik logs I don't see any single action and it looks like device don't even try to connect to my Mikrotik router. I use Mikrotik RB2011UiAS-2HnD-IN device configured with WPA2 Personal security profile.   My RB2011UiAS-2HnD-IN Mikrotik AP configuration  My RB2011UiAS-2HnD-IN Mikrotik AP security profile  strongWhat could cause the problem ?/strong  I have heard that iPads have problem with some anti-radar detection settings but my newest Mikrotik firmware seems not to have any kind of this and it is looks like something fom the far past.  <comment361828> It doesn't make sense to have both WPA2-PSK and WPA2-EAP enabled. If you aren't using a RADIUS server or other username/password authentication setup, you should disable WPA2-EAP on your AP.
