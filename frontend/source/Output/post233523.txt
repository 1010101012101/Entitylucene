My Bookmarkers in iPhone 6 and my iPad Air do not sync <body> My Bookmarkers in iPhone 6 and my iPad Air do not sync. When I read  and mark my page on my iPad my iPhone 6  will show the page the last time I used the iPhone.   I have under settings the iBooks icon showing I selected "Sync Bookmarks and Notes" and "Sync Collections" showing Green as on.   What else can I do to make it work like it use to before the update a few months ago? I just installed the new update 9.3.1 and the problem still exists.  <comment285636> Do you have iCloud Drive turned on for iBooks (new feature in 9.3)?  (It's under Settings  iCloud  iCloud Drive.)  I did not turn that on, and I'm having the same problem with bookmarks and notes not syncing between devices.
