Can I get a table-only view in iBooks like on iOS in OS X? <body> Oftentimes, tables are cropped in iBooks so that information is missing because the table doesn't fit on a page. On iOS, I can tap the table and get a table-only view just like I can with pictures. This allows just the table to take up the entire screen without regard to fitting on a page.  Is there a way to do this in iBooks for OS X? When I try clicking on a table, it selects text, but I want it to zoom in. I want the table to fill the entire window temporarily so that I can view it without resizing my pages.
