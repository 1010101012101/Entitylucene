Can't boot Windows after installing Windows 10 with Boot Camp <body> I installed Windows 10 with Boot Camp Assistant in El Captain. I successfully completed all Boot Camp installation steps. After finishing the installation and rebooting the Windows boot option doesn't appear.  I tried this installation twice but without success. Partition is successfully created though.  How can I continue to get the Windows boot option?  stronggpt/fdisk results/strong:  precodesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0      start       size  index  contents         0          1         PMBR         1          1         Pri GPT header         2         32         Pri GPT table        34          6                 40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B    409640  315141264      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 315550904    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 316820440   15625256          332445696  157788160      4  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 490233856        863          490234719         32         Sec GPT table 490234751          1         Sec GPT header   sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 Disk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 30515/255/63 [490234752 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55         Starting       Ending #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  490234751] &lt;Unknown ID&gt; 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused     /code/pre  Specs: Macbook Pro 13 Early 2015.  <answer225025> This article might help: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204417  Section below:  Use these steps to choose a startup disk with Startup Manager:  ol liTurn on or restart your Mac. /li liImmediately press and hold the Option key.
