Has anyone tried to use a VGA monitor to the latest mac mini? <body> I recently purchased the latest mac mini (with an included HDMI to DVI-D connector). My monitor is VGA so I want to still utilize it. The problem is, Apple does not sell DVI-D to VGA adapter.   I'm looking at buying one on ebay. Is that the right adapter to use? Has anyone tried connecting the latest mac mini to a VGA monitor?  <answer34668> Why use DVI-D as an interface? Your machine already has an HDMI and Thunderbolt port, and Apple recommends using a VGA adapter on the Thunderbolt port for that. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4806?viewlocale=en_GB .  <comment39631> Wow, you saved my day! I have here a Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter and I never thought that would be applicable to this mac mini. Thanks a lot :)
