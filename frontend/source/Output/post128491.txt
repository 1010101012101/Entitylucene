How to stop apps from opening automatically when I plug things in <body> I do iOS development work, and I can't stand how iTunes and iPhoto automatically open when I plug in a device.  I don't want anything to ever open automatically when I plug something in.  How do I make it so?  <answer128493> In iPhoto  Preferences  General select "Connecting Camera opens: no application"  In iTunes select your device and go to Summary and make sure "Automatically sync when this iPhone [or whatever device it is] is connected" is unchecked.  emI'm not certain the second one will completely solve opening iTunes since I can't test it as I don't have a cable here with me./em   <answer129111> I can confirm that iTunes no longer opens upon iPhone connect when you un-check the "Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected" option under the "Summary" tab when in your iPhone settings in iTunes (see below) :)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OT9ZP.png" alt="iTunes auto sync feature"  <comment159786> also possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/27318
