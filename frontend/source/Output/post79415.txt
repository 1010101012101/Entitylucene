What is Format Painter shortcut in Excel 2011 for Mac? <body> I've been looking on the Internet for the shortcut to the Format Painter tool. No luck so far, it seems there's no shortcut for this tool. Maybe someone here knows better.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aEX3k.jpg" alt="Format Painter Icon"  <answer79417> There is no official keyboard shortcut for that. But you can customize a shortcut. Here's how: http://thelostgeeks.blogspot.com/2012/10/keyboard-shortcut-to-copypaste.html     Go to Tools- Customize Keyboard. Select  "Edit" from categories. On   the right hand side select "Formatting". Go to "Press new shortcut   key" and type in a new shortcut. I used Command + Shift + v. And ,   click on "Add" . Close the window. All set. Now i can just use the   normal copy ( Command + c)  the cells from which i want to copy the   formatting. Then go the cell where i want to paste the format and hit   the keyboard shortcut (Command + Shift + v). BAM ! the format is   copied.   <answer135023> This article here gave a detail guide on how to solve this quickly.  http://thelostgeeks.blogspot.com/2012/10/keyboard-shortcut-to-copypaste.html  <answer167877> There is (now) a predefined shortcut for this  ul liTo copy the format: kbdCMD/kbd+kbdSHFT/kbd+kbdC/kbd/li liTo paste the copied format: kbdCMD/kbd+kbdSHFT/kbd+kbdV/kbd/li /ul  <answer204307> Within Microsoft Office, one can use:  ul liCmd + Opt + c to copy format/li liCmd + Opt + v to paste format/li /ul  <comment257077> The words to describe the icon you selected is the format painter shortcut in excel.
