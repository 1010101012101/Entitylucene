Display issue with Yosemite on MacBook Air <body> Please check image  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ARoHg.png" alt="enter image description here"  Anyone facing same issue?  <answer214888> Latest update fixed display issue.  <comment243666> maybe try http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/157060/icons-disappearing-from-menu-bar <comment243671> @Tetsujin I checked it before positing my question. Solution on that thread didn't help though. <comment243672> Is that a retina screen? & is it running at standard resolution? I don't have retina & I tried with & without the Day showing & it still fits OK for me. <comment244834> @Tetsujin It's not a retina screen and running at standard resolution
