Unable to enter directories in Finder after moving directories to NAS <body> I have a NAS, which I use for storing my old photos. When emmoving/em the remainder of my 2016 photos, the following problem occurred, but without any error message during the move operation. The move operation was done by holding the kbdcmd/kbd-button while dragging and dropping in Finder. In Finder on OS X version 10.11.6, the directory looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qpCTu.png" alt="Directory listing in Finder"  Using Finder, I can enter directories like code2016-10-15/code, but not the ones with different icons. code2016-11-27/code is a directory, and code2016-12-01/code should not be shown twice, but is a result of the erroneous move operation.  I have researched online to figure this out, but have not yet found a solution. One of the possible explanations was extended attributes. I ran a codexattr -c */code to clear all of the attributes. This did remove the attributes, but didn't solve the problem.  I can enter the directories using Terminal.  precodemachinename:2016 user$ ls -al 2016-11-27 total 34600 drwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff       264 24 Jan 21:18 . drwxrwxr-x  1 user  staff      7606 16 Mar 20:14 .. -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   1339112 24 Jan 21:05 2016-11-27 08.47.29.jpg -rwxrwxrwx  1 user  staff  12069896 27 Nov 16:58 DSC_0151.JPG /code/pre  Any other ideas on how to fix this?  <answer277876> From the symptoms you describe I suspect a damaged code.DS_Store/code file in the parent folder.   Try deleting it while the folder is closed in the Finder. Close all open windows in the Finder, then in Terminal coderm .DS_Store/code while in the directory. This should be the same directory you were in when you ran the command in your question. Now codeopen ./code will open the directory in the Finder and all should be OK. If that doesn't work you could also try deleting the code.DS_Store/code in the directory above.  If neither of those work then I would try copying the entire folder tree in Terminal using the codecp/code command.  <answer284710> Finally managed to find a solution using the following steps:  1) Took a complete backup of the main photo folder using codetar/code.  2) Figured out which file types I had (while keeping in mind that codejpg/code and codeJPG/code are not identical)  codefind . -type f | awk -F . '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2,":",$1}'/code  3) Then copied the files using codersync/code, specifying each file type from the above result (it was the code2016/code-folder that had issues, so I copied the files I positively knew I wanted to code2016-test/code):  codersync -zarv --include="*/" --include="*.AVI" --include="*.JPG"  --include="*.MOV" --include="*.jpg"  --include="*.mov"  --include="*.mp4"  --include="*.png" --include="*.ini" --exclude="*" 2016/ 2016-test//code  <comment349267> Emphasizing "moving" means: you moved the folders from the local Mac to the NAS share with cmd-shift? <comment349290> @klanomath, yes exactly, moving (not copying) by holding the CMD-key while dragging and dropping in Finder. <comment350008> I tried to run a `find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete` in the parent directory, but this didn't work out. Copying the files in Terminal didn't either. <comment350399> Try the `find` again and remove the `-type -f` since it may cause a problem. Note that you want to run it in the folder *above* the one that contains the problem folders <comment350472> Thanks, Tony - I tried to run `# find . -name '.DS_Store' -delete -print` once again, and only got `./2016/.DS_Store` as the result (which means that the `-type f` worked previously)... I'm out of ideas. <comment350563> What happens if you go in to one of the directories that won't open in the Finder in the shell and then go `open .` ? <comment350956> It opens a new Finder window with the folder selected as an object within the parent directory - i.e. I can't see the contents of the directory in Finder.
