Override keyboard shortcut in Safari 6 <body> In Safari 6, the keyboard shortcut kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbd1/kbd opens the first bookmark on the bookmark bar. In Safari 5 I used a macro activated by that same shortcut to activate kbd⌘ Commmand/kbd-kbd]/kbd to go forward a page.    The reason is that I have another macro activated by the shortcut kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbd`/kbd to go back a page.  It is convenient to use one hand and the two adjacent keys: thumb on the kbd⌘ Command/kbdkey, middle finger on the kbd`/kbd and kbd1/kbd keys.  How can this key binding in Safari 6 be changed?  <answer164361> You can add/change any Key Command frombr System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts  Click the + button then add the info you require. [Later removing any custom binding will revert the app to its default binding]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iQPxg.png" alt="enter image description here"
