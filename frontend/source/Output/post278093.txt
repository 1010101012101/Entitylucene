Use of the requested audio unit(s) require lowering the security settings <body> I just started getting this alert at seemingly random points in Finder:     Use of the requested audio unit(s) require lowering of the security settings for "Quick Look UI Helper". Are you sure you want to proceed?      [Lower Security Settings] [Cancel]   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cUINq.jpg" alt="Screenshot of alert"  This appears even when the selected item in the Finder cannot be quick-looked (e.g. AVI files).  Does anyone have any idea what it means and what causes it? This hasn't appeared before the latest software update and no search results match the alert text, so I'm suspecting this is something new in the OS update.  OS: macOS Sierra 10.12.4br Hardware: Mid-2012 MacBook Pro  <answer286970> I have come across one (strong!/strong) reply on the Apple boards.  I want anyone who reads this to take it with a stronggrain of caution/strong. This 'emanswer/em' does not seem to ring as '110%' accurate.     You are using a Codec component that is not compatible with macOS Sierra. That Codec component was a part of a library that conflicts with macOS Sierra and in order for Quicktime to load would require to change the "Quick Look UI Helper" security settings. If you really need that Codec component you can proceed by clicking "Quick Look UI Helper" Lower Security Settings.
