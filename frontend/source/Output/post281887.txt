Font Book Collections Broken in Sierra 10.12.4 <body> After reformatting my drive and doing a clean install of Sierra 10.12.4 I discovered that I can no long add fonts to collections unless I add them first, close Font Book and reopen it. Anyone have a solution for this problem? Creating new users and safe booting is not resolving the issue.   <comment356914> Font book seems a  mess in Sierra.  Smart collections have never worked for various languages including Chinese for me.  El Capitan perfect.
