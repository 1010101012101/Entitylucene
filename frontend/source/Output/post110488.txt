AppleScript for moving completed downloads to other folders <body> I'm looking to write a script that will move all file in the downloads folder (once fully downloaded) to different folders on the hard drive and external hard drive. Where can I learn more about how to do this?  <answer110491> This is the Apple official documentation regarding Applescript.  Here are two other tutorials, all obtained through google when I was learning myself.  http://macosxautomation.com/applescript/firsttutorial/index.html  http://mac.tutsplus.com/tutorials/automation/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-applescript-2/  I found both the above very good.  <answer110492> You could use a folder action like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jCPjZ.png" alt=""  Or create rules like this in Hazel:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHzWQ.png" alt=""
