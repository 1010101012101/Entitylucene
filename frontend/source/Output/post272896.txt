Cannot set AppleShowScrollBars for Eclipse using defaults on Sierra 10.12 <body> Ok. So I like my scrollbars turned off in general. However, it turns out Eclipse has this issue that cripples the scrolling speed to a couple of fps unless scrollbars are turned on..  I thought I could do something like:  precodedefaults write -app Eclipse AppleShowScrollBars Always /code/pre  .. to only enable scrollbars in Eclipse, but no dice. Anyone got a better idea?  <comment343190> FWIW - defaults write -app Firefox AppleShowScrollBars Always works equally well (as in - it doesn't work). Is this something that's been swept away with Sierra? If I intentionally misspell -app Firefox as -app Fyrefex I get a warning... (Couldn't find an application named "Fyrefex"; defaults unchanged)
