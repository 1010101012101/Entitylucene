Does the Airport Extreme support wireless roaming and guest network? <body> I'm looking to purchase two Apple Airport Extreme base station units to use as wireless access points only. They will be connected via Ethernet to my network closet. Internet gateway is handled by my VPN/Firewall server. DHCP/DNS requests go to the Mac Mini Server.  The Mac Mini Server has Open Directory and RADIUS services enabled.   ul liIs WPA2-Personal Guest Networking still supported when the AP are using RADIUS?/li liCan DHCP be disabled on the AP while still providing wireless roaming? I'd like to be able to walk around my building and when one signal becomes weak the other signal can be picked up without loss of connectivity./li /ul
