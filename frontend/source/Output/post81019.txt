Why does File:/// crash my app? <body> Whenever I type codeFile:////code into the URL bar in Chrome, into Text Edit, and more, it crashes the app. I found out about this after reading this blog post.  How can I avoid this crash and make it impossible for apps that get this string whether it's typed, pasted or arrives in a file, message or download?  <answer81020> It's a bug in 10.8.1 and 10.8.2 only.  The workaround for this pesky bug is to disable two items in strongLanguage &amp; Text Preference Pane/strong in System Preferences on affected versions of Mountain Lion:  ul liSelect (click) on Text in the middle towards the top of the window/li lideselect (uncheck) "Correct spelling automatically"/li lideselect (uncheck) "Use symbol and text substitution"/li /ul  Credit for this workaround goes to user shess on the open radar web site.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KP7ta.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer81025> bmike has the workaround, I'll provide the "why": According to this article from TheNextWeb, a feature called Data Detectors, which scans text for meaningful formats (dates, locations...) also looks for file URLs. It does this by looking for "file://", case-insensitive. However, later in the procedure, it asserts that the string should start with "file://" lowercase -- and when this is not the case, such as when there is a capital F, it throws an exception, which apparently (and extremely sloppily) brings down the whole application.  <comment93432> Does it crash the app, or does it crash your system? <comment93441> @kojiro: the app. In case of programs like Chrome or text editors, this is a VERY severe bug, seeing as you lose all work. <comment93442> I'm not arguing it's not severe, I'm just pointing out that the title and last sentence says *system*, but it does not, in fact, crash your system. <comment93445> @kojiro: type it into Spotlight, and it crashes the bar. Yes, not quite a kernel panic, but severe enough to warrant "system" imo. <comment93451> Are you more concerned about people typing 8 characters on your computer than you are about them selecting Force Quit or Shutdown from the Apple menu? <comment93492> This doesn't work if it's a message received in Messages.app <comment93616> @Gert Nice - it also won't work in some cases where you get a file with that string (or similar string) embedded in the filesystem and the crash code starts getting fancy with what looks like a URL/URI. I would be astounded if the next security or dot update doesn't squash this high profile bug. <comment93764> let's hope so. Just for the record. To fix `Messages.app`, you need to remove your `chat.db` in `~/Library/Messages/` <comment94133> @RussellBorogove The danger is not someone typing on your computer but people sending you a message, mail or document with the text in it. Mail will crash, reopen, crash until you manually delete the file with the *dangerous* content. <comment95987> As described, it does indeed crash because of a (rather nasty) bug in 10.8.1/10.8.2. I would like to confirm, for reasons of clarity, that in 10.8.3, it has been fixed. (I am running the beta version - Build 12D68)
