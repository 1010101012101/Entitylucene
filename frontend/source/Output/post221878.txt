How to change citation language in Microsoft Word for Mac 2015 (15.17.1)? <body> When I add a source without a date to my Microsoft Word document in Microsoft Word 2015 (15.17.1) on OS X 10.11.2 and insert a citation, the inserted field states code(Author, kein Datum)/code in German (codekein Datum/code translates to codeno date/code). But I'm writing this document in English language and want the inserted field to actually state codeno date/code in English.  In the bottom line, Word states that the document language is codeEnglish (UK)/code and my system language (codeSystem Preferences &gt; Language &amp; Region/code) is also English.  How can I change the language of the inserted field containing the citation?  <answer221934> There is a rather inconvenient solution to this problem, but this seems to be the only currently available solution due to the lack of Mac OSX support of Microsoft Word features.  After inserting the reference in German (or whatever) language, you can right-click it and choose codeToggle Field Codes.../code. Then you will see the code of the inserted field. For German citations this is something like code{CITATION ABC15 \l 1031}/code where codeABC15/code is the unique name of the source and code\l 1031/code refers to the language of the inserted field. code1031/code is in fact codeGerman (Germany)/code according to Locale identification numbers for language-specific files.  Knowing the unique source name, you can insert a field on your own from codeInsert &gt; Field... &gt; Citation/code and in the box below enter codeCITATION ABC15 \l 1033/code where code1033/code now stands for codeEnglish (US)/code. Then the citation will be inserted in English (US) language. More information on the citation field can be found here.  Looking at Microsoft Word 2015 strongfor Windows/strong, there you have the ability to change the language of every single source in the emEdit Source/em dialog and also to gather its unique name from the emEdit Source/em dialog.  <answer238714> An easier approach (if you only have a few citations to change &amp; you won't be modifying your text anymore) is to change the citation into a "Static text" and manually rewriting the citation.  ol liWhat you do is you find the citation that you wish to edit./li liClick it once so that the the "grey background" appears behind the text and on the right side of the "grey background" a blue arrow also appears./li liClick the arrow and a drop down list should appear./li liClick "Convert Citations to Static Text"/li /ol  Now the Citation is free to be manually edited.  <comment268722> Workaround would be to right-click the citation `Edit This Citation...  Suppress: Year`.
