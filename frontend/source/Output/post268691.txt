how to start a mysql server on login <body> I currently use Valet to develop sites, and many of those sites need SQL databases.  To host SQL databases, I run a mariaDB server from the Terminal.  In order to start the MySQL server so that I can connect to the databases, I run the command:  codesudo mysql.server start/code I want the server to start on login, so normally I would just have this command execute on login, but it requires the sudo command.  What do I change and how do I change it so that I do not need the sudo part of the command and I can just start the server on login?  <answer268692> The best way to do this is to create a codelaunchd/code .plist, copy it to code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code and let the system handle it for you.  Sample .plist:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;com.user.startMySQL&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;           &lt;string&gt;mysql.server&lt;/string&gt;           &lt;string&gt;start&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  I prefer to use the file naming convention codecom.user.&lt;name of function&gt;.plist/code when naming them so I can easily identify what is loaded and what is not.  Next, you need to load this .plist as coderoot/code so it runs as coderoot/code  code$ sudo launchctl load com.user.startMySQL.plist/code  To verify that it has loaded you can issue the command codesudo launchctl list/code and the command codemysql/code to initiate a connection to the MySQL service.  emPlease note that this is just a simple example - you may wish to create a script to check to see if codemysqld/code is already running before launching it./em  <comment337410> See if [this Q&A](http://stackoverflow.com/q/26476391/3487310) helps.  It's not a duplicate question but it has info that might assist you. <comment337676> but it sounds like I will have to run this command every time I want to use the server, so I dont see how this is better than what I do now.  actually I was just looking for which permissions or owner to change to make this command runnable by me without sudo, so that I can then just execute this command on login somehow. <comment337682> You only have to do this once.  It will launch MySQL automatically every time you log in <comment338254> oh ok thanks  Tell me if understand this correctly: 'launchd' is a daemon that starts at launch and runs every job in 'launchctl'.  In order to add a job to launchctl, define it in a .plist file and copy that file to ~/Library/LaunchAgents, then load the plist into launchctl with$ launchctl load com.user.startMySQL.plist and the reason a path does not have to be given in the command is that a file name is sufficient as long as it is a file in the 'LaunchAgents' directory because launchctl looks in that directory.  Once loaded into launchctl, launchd will run the new job on login. <comment338322> That's basically correct.  I have written about `launchd` in more detail in this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/249446/launchd-plist-format-for-running-a-command-at-a-specific-time-on-a-weekday/249452#249452)  Personally, I wourld start your server on boot rather than on login, but whatever suits you best...
