So Apple A7 is “System on chip or” or “CPU”? <body> Very confused, in some websites, they have this line:  pre iPhone 5s  CPU: Apple A7 /pre  other websites saying that:  pre iPhone 5s System-on-chip: Apple 7 CPU: 1.3 GHz 64bit dual core /pre  other sources saying that  pre iPhone 5s System-on-chip: Apple 7 CPU: 1.3 GHz 64bit dual core Apple 7 /pre  in Wiki, it said:     The Apple A7 is a 64-bit system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc.   It first appeared in the iPhone 5S, which was introduced on September   10, 2013. Apple states that it is up to twice as fast and has up to   twice the graphics power compared to its predecessor, the Apple   A6. While not the first 64-bit ARM CPU, it is the first to   ship in a consumer smartphone or tablet computer.   There are 2 sentences:  precodeThe Apple A7 is a 64-bit system on a chip (SoC) /code/pre  &amp;   precode  While not the first 64-bit ARM CPU /code/pre  Wiki also said codeThe A7 features an Apple-designed 64-bit 1.3–1.4 GHz ARMv8-A dual-core CPU, called Cyclone/code  So System on chip is also CPU? very confused  Then other source compares System on chip and CPU, they said "CPU will not work without other around components" &amp; "System on chip is the combination of CPU &amp; other components into a single chip."  <answer134637> A emSOC/em contains more elements than just the CPU (graphics capabilities, sound, IO controllers etc), but the CPU is by far the largest, most complex component within it.  A SOC can be referred to as the CPU, because that's where it is (the rest of the contents  of a SOC are more variable, but there emhas/em to be a CPU), but obviously not all CPU can be classified as a SOC.  <answer134638> The A7 as the A4, A5 and the A6 are Systems on a chip.   On the chip there is the CPU (an ARMv8), the GPU (a Power VR), the IO controllers and the RAM.   <comment159369> seem ur answer is right, so ARMv8-A is faster than ARM Cortex A8 (in iPhone 4) & Cortext A9 in 4s? <comment159379> ok, i got it ARM Cortext A8 & A9 use 32-bit ARM architecture such as ARMv7-A while the ARMv8 use 64-bit <comment159389> Are you sure the SoCs Apple use have integrated memory? I'm quite sure they stack chips, rather than integrating it onto the same die. <comment159403> Yes they are stacked (RAM above the CPU/GPU/IO) it's not the same die but the same chip !
