Does a DFU restore replace the iOS bootloaders? <body> According to Apple's iOS security documents, the secure boot chain utilized by iOS on bootup is the following:   1. BootROM (hardwired into the CPU) verifies Low Level Bootloader; if failed, device enters DFU mode  2. LLB verifies iBoot, which verifies the kernel; if failed, device enters recovery mode  strongIf I restore my iPhone from iTunes by manually entering DFU mode, will the LLB and all higher software systems be erased and replaced with the newest iOS?/strong If not, I am concerned that malware could reside in the bootloader(s) and remain with my device after the reset.    I have not updated my iPhone software since iOS 8.1, and therefore have been vulnerable to browser exploits and other vulnerabilities for an extended period of time. I also have not practiced safe browsing habits (i.e. I have regularly visited sites known to possess malicious code), so a full restore of all system software, including the bootloaders, is necessary to ensure my device's security.
