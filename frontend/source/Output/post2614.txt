Is there a way to change iPhone backup location? <body> I don't have enough disk space on my PC to store whatever is backed up by iPhone. Is there a way to change location to where iPhone backs up the data? I want to back it up to my external hard drive.   <answer2616> It looks like you can if using Windows.  Is OS X the backups seems to be stored in the following location ...  precode~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup /code/pre  ... but I don't think you can change that location.  <answer69282> You can, however, drop a copy of that folder to your external drive - or include that folder in whatever backup/clone app you're using.  <comment80513> But perhaps you can change it to be a symbolic link to a folder in an external drive. <comment80531> @lhf yeah probably :) <comment151894> Here's a page describing how to do it on a Mac: http://osxdaily.com/2011/03/05/how-to-move-the-iphoneipad-itunes-backup-folder-to-an-external-hard-drive/
