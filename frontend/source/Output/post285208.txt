Is there any way i can restart my whole ipod disconnecting it from my old email on icloud? <body> I found my old ipod touch from middle school. I no longer know the Icloud emial or password. I had factory restored my ipod and when i went to reboot it, "Find my iphone" is activated so if someone stole my ipod no one could access it, so in turn I kinda screwed myself over. Is there any way I can by pass this whole thing when i cant access inside my ipod or icloud?  I ve already restored the ipod on itunes, and when my ipod turns on it informs me that I need to know my old icloud account thats hooked up to it to get past it.  My question is is there any way i can restart my whole ipod discconecting it from that old email?
