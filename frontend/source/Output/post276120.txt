What does mkdir -p do? specifically the "-p" part? <body> I have had some trouble understanding when manipulating my Terminal with the making of directories, and I've encountered with this "-p" option in the network trying to find easier ways to create directories. Any help? :/  <answer276121> Have you tried running the codeman mkdir/code command in Terminal? Doing so results in the following explanation for the code-p/code option:     Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is                not specified, the full path prefix of each operand must already                exist.  On the other hand, with this option specified, no error                will be reported if a directory given as an operand already                exists.  Intermediate directories are created with permission                bits of rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask, plus                write and search permission for the owner.   So basically  precodemkdir foo/bar/baz/quizz /code/pre  will fail unless the directories codefoo/code, codefoo/bar/code and codefoo/bar/baz/code already exist.  precodemkdir -p  foo/bar/baz/quizz /code/pre  will create any missing directories in the path (as long as you have write permissions in the parent directory) emand/em ensure that the permissions allow you to access them.  <comment347540> Thank you so much!, now I get it hahaha, anyways, I'll try and keep up learning :D
