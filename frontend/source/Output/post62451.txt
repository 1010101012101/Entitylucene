Can Mountain Lion be modified so that a double click will open "hidden" folders and files? <body> I've noticed something strange in Finder since upgrading to Mountain Lion; any hidden folder or files (that I've already run codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/code for) can only be opened by manually Ctrl-clicking the it and selecting Open. Is there a way I can modify Finder's behavior to be able to double-click and open hidden files and folders as was possible on Lion?  <answer62543> Obvious, but âŒ˜-O works fast enough for me, rather than trying to modify Finder.  <answer63375> Its looks like this might be a Mountain Lion Bug and a bug report has been submitted to Apple for this issue. Additionally, after some testing its seems that stronghidden files and folders will not open when double-clicked/strong from with in a Finder window that has an icons, lists, or Cover Flow view selected.  Note:  emFor the Cover flow view double-click does not work in the list view, yet double clicking items in the cover flow section will cause the file or folder to open./em  Note: emIf you double-click hidden files/folders on the desktop they open as expected, which seems odd, and kind of indicates that this not working in most Finder window views is just a bug./em  strongWork Arounds until the bug (hopefully its a bug and not a new feature) is fixed by Apple:/strong   Use the "column" or "Cover Flow" Finder views.  ul liWith column view selected hidden folders just open when clicked on, and hidden files open as expected when double-clicked. /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2i0nu.png" alt="Finder Column view selected"  ul liWith the Cover Flow view selected the work around is two steps.  ol liClick on the hidden file or folder in the list on the bottom of the window./li liThen double-click on the file or folder to open it./li /ol/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KSTwM.png" alt="Finder Cover Flow view selected"  <comment72233> Yeah I am aware of this shortcut but what I am really concerned about is double-click. Thanks anyway <comment73000> How are your folder/s hidden? is its names starting with a leading "dot" or does it have the Invisible bit set? <comment73140> either way a folder is hidden, @MrDaniel , I cannot double-click any of them to open them <comment73328> perfect. just the answer i was looking for; any idea when an update for this might be pushed out? <comment73337> No idea, it could take weeks or months or longer, Apple has not provided any feedback on the issue, as of yet, I will keep this posted. <comment73497> I made ~/Library visible, and double-click works on it as normal. <comment231130> I submitted this bug recently, and they responded that my report was a duplicate (as expected). My report was a "Duplicate of 12259956 (Open)". So this is still in there bug database as a valid bug. Maybe they will fix it eventually.
