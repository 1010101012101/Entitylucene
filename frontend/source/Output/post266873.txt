Office 365 keeps prompting for login credentials on Mac OSX? <body> Office 365 keeps prompting for login credentials within Mac OSX? I came across a problem where a client of mine had bought and installed Office Suite 2016 she than upgraded to Office 365 Business Premium.  <answer266874> I had to uninstall office suite and clear keychain for Microsoft Office, once that was established Office 365 no longer kept prompting for key and user credentials. Hope this helps!   <answer271248> Here is what solved it for me.
