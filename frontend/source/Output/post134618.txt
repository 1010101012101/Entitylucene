MacBook Pro not noticing all files after cancelling and retrying Migration Assistant <body> I bought a new MacBook Pro and tried to transfer all of my files from a 5-year-old MacBook Pro using the Migration Assistant. Both of them are running OS X 10.9.3 (Mavericks).  It seemed to be working fine but it told me that I had to wait 20 hours and I didn't want to wait that long. It said that plugging in an ethernet cable would speed up the transfer. I tried that (via a Thunderbolt adapter on the new Mac) and it didn't seem to do anything. I then cancelled the migration by pressing command + Q.  I am trying it again and it doesn't seem to notice all of my files. On the new Mac, it says I only have 157 KB of data on the old one, even though I have a lot more than that. I tried transferring it anyway and it just restarted right away while the old one said it was trying to reconnect with the new one. I don't see any of my files on the new one.  I tried booting with Command + R and reinstalling the OS on the new Mac but that didn't seem to do anything.  Here is what I see on the new Mac: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FE246.jpg" alt="strange message from migration assistant"  What can I do to properly transfer my files?  <comment159342> I managed to transfer my data from an external hard drive with a Time Machine backup. I am leaving this question up in case it may be of use to anyone else. <comment159348> I have seen a couple of Macs running Mavericks do this too. Anyone got any ideas why this happens?
