Are tags retained on Time Machine backups and in Trash? <body> When viewing by strongtags/strong in Finder I get no results from Time Machine or Trash.  Are tags not retained by Time Machine or Trash?  What about external disks?  Spotlight is configured to index everything, no exceptions.  <answer262932> Spotlight doesn't index Time Machine backups or the Trash.  It does do external disks but certain conditions have to be met for it to do them.  <comment329189> It's my understanding that spotlight won't index a TM backup, as it's a special kind of folder.
