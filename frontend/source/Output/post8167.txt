How can I activate my iPod if my PC is running Linux? <body> I just bought an iPod, and when I turn it shows an image with the USB cable and iTunes. It wants me to plug it to a computer with iTunes? But I use Linux, what do I do?  <answer8178> A few solutions, not all of them good:  ul liIf possible, update to iOS 5 (probably at the Apple Store) and don't use iTunes./li liFind a friend with a Mac or a PC and get them to activate it./li liGo to the Apple Store (as Randolph said) and ask them./li liRun Windows in VirtualBox (or another VM solution), and use iTunes from there. (thanks, Fake Name)/li liGet sixty million of your best friends to switch to Linux and all complain at Apple for a Linux port of iTunes./li liRun iTunes in Wine, if that's possible./li /ul  <comment8807> Go back to the Apple Store and ask them to activate the iPod for you. <comment8814> I don't think it'll run in WINE. Too many dependencies on device drivers I think. <comment8823> That's why it's after "get sixty million people to ask for iTunes on Linux" - it's less likely to happen. <comment8825> You forgot "Install Windows in a VirtualBox VM, install iTunes, Activate iPod". It's probably easiest. <comment8829> That is a much better solution, thanks. <comment8841> I gone back to the store, thanks! Now I'll read about synchronization using Rhythmbox or iTunes with wine.. :)
