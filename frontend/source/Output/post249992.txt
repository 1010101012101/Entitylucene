Move all "All on My iPhone" contacts to "All Gmail" group <body> I have been syncing my iPhone and Gmail contacts for years and consistently run into this problem. Some of my contacts were created in the group "All on My iPhone", always without my knowledge, instead of the Gmail group. strongContacts in this group will not sync to Gmail/strong. I have learned how to set my default account to Gmail so hopefully I will stop creating iPhone only contacts, but this doesn't fix the problem with the 100+ contacts I already have in this group on two different phones. Is there a way for me to force ALL contacts from the iPhone only group into the Gmail group? Is there a way for me to export just the iPhone group so I can then import them to Gmail using the web interface?  An even better solution would be a way to permanently disable the iPhone only group. I have absolutely no need to have different contact lists. I would love for all my contacts to sync seamlessly across all devices without any "controls" to complicate the process.  Thanks for any advice!  <answer250199> There is no easy way to move contacts between accounts. No company wants to make it too easy. The only option on iPhone would be to merge the On My iPhone contacts with an iCloud account (turning Contacts on and off if necessary under Settings  iCloud).   From there you can log into iCloud.com  open the contacts web app  click the gear at the bottom left and select all  Click the gear at the bottom left and export vCard  Then you can import that vCard into gmail.com  Finally turn off the Contacts for iCloud and it will offer to delete.  Under Settings  Mail, Contacts and Calendars if there iOS a default account listed under contacts make sure it says gmail.   Alternately - type lots.
