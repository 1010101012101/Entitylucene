Can't authenticate my Mac as it won't let me enter details <body> I need to install software but it's asking for authentication. However, when the boxes appear it's all blank and I can't type anything in the boxes. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZE5Dm.png" alt="Screenshot" This keeps happening with fonts and software.  <comment168128> This might be due to localization issues. Do you have a non-US system language? Another option is a corrupted library, does this also occur in other user accounts?
