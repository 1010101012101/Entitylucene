It comes from the OS, not a 3rd party app.  <answer32915> The built-in application is called Grab. You can find it under the Utilities folder in Applications.  You can also use keyboard shortcuts to take screen shots. Here's a quick guide from Apple:     In Mac OS X, you can use simple keyboard shortcuts to do all sorts of things, including capturing images of what’s on your Mac screen. For example, you can take a screen shot of your entire screen by holding down the Command and Shift keys and pressing a 3.      If you hold down the Command and Shift keys and press 4, Mac OS X turns the cursor into crosshairs you can use to select whatever portion of your display you’d like to capture in a screen shot.      If you immediately hit the Spacebar after typing Command-Shift-4, Mac OS X replaces those crosshairs with a little camera. Using the camera, you can take a screen shot of the Dock, the entire menu bar, a single open menu, the desktop, or any open window.   <answer32927> You can also take screenshots with Preview via File - Take Screen Shot. This gives you the following options:  ul liFrom Selection.../li liFrom Window.../li liFrom Entire Screen/li /ul  Each screenshot is captured in a separate Preview window so it is mostly useful to collect screenshots and process them afterwards.  <answer33178> I generally use the built-in screen grab utility. If you hold down the strongControl/strong key in addition to the other keys (i.e. strongCommand-Shift-4/strong), the captured image will be sent to the clipboard rather than being saved as a file. I find this useful when I'm pasting the screen grab directly into a document.  Apple's documentation of this feature is available from the Help Menu. Search for strongShortcuts for taking pictures of the screen/strong  There are a number of third-party applications that offer various enhancements to the screen grabbing experience. For example if you plan to do a lot of post-production manipulation, Layers will save every element on the screen as a separate layer of a .psd document.  <comment37630> http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61544 <comment37633> I've always used the keyboard shortcuts.  I didn't know the application had a name. <comment37869> IIRC Grab was the name of the app even back in NeXTSTEP days. <comment38954> "simple keyboard shortcuts" is worded a bit ironic by Apple. I wonder how many non-power users can remember that combo... I know how to do it from muscle memory (because I use it a lot), but I wouldn't be able to write the combination down.
