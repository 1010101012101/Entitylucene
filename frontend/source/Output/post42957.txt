Protecting the Lens on iPhone 4 <body> The lens on my iPhone was pretty badly scratched up so the pictures I was taking were horrible in quality.  I had the back glass replaced yesterday and now have a new lens.  How do I protect this new lens from getting scratched up?  <comment48837> Are you looking for something other than the obvious "use a case or put it in a sleeve?" <comment48858> Yes I am.  If you have the keys in your pocket or lose change, they tend to scratch the lens face even if you have put it in case - I don't know of a case that covers the face of the lens. <comment48870> Maybe consider not putting the phone in the same pocket as change and keys. ;)
