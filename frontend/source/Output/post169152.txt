How to read ePubs on a first generation iPad <body> My father has a 1st generation iPad. I can't seem to find a single eBook reader that is compatible. iBooks should have a compatible version, but it won't install it.  I have read about using iTunes to sync older versions, but his Mac mini is so old it won't even 'see' the iPad on iTunes.  Any ideas?  <answer170163> BeyondPrint Reader iTunes Store link: https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/beyondprint-reader/id464926033?mt=8  Installed and working!  <comment198595> The 1st gen iPad seems to me to have very quickly become the "forgotten child". <comment198662> Marvin, if you can get an old version. Or, alas, the now defunct Stanza, which was a fabulous reader app.
