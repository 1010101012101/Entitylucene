Which applications should be in the Utilities folder? <body> A while ago I wanted to make things more convenient so I organized the my Mac applications in folders. Little did I know, it prevented Software Updates to detect needed updates.  Now, I've been trying to revert things the way they were. For most Apple application, thats easy, just put it at the root Application folder. However there is the "Utilities" folder, that I played with a bit.  Which application should and should NOT be in this folder?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGRbO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer28289> On my system, these ones from your screenshot are in Applications, not Utilities:  ul liiSync/li liMicrosoft Silverlight/li liSystem Preferences/li liTime Machine/li /ul  <answer28300> h3Applications/h3  ul liAddress Book/li liApp Store/li liAutomator/li liCalculator/li liChess/li liDashboard/li liDictionary/li liDVD Player/li liFaceTime/li liFont Book/li liiCal/li liiChat/li liImage Capture/li liiTunes/li liLaunchpad/li liMail/li liMission Control/li liPhoto Booth/li liPreview/li liQuickTime Player/li liSafari/li liStickies/li liSystem Preferences/li liTextEdit/li liTime Machine/li /ul  h3Utilities/h3  ul liActivity Monitor/li liAirPort Utility/li liAppleScript Editor/li liAudio MIDI Setup/li liBluetooth File Exchange/li liBoot Camp Assistant/li liColorSync Utility/li liConsole/li liDigitalColor Meter/li liDisk Utility/li liGrab/li liGrapher/li liJava Preferences/li liKeychain Access/li liMigration Assistant/li liNetwork Link Conditioner/li liNetwork Utility/li liPodcast Capture/li liPodcast Publisher/li liRAID Utility/li liServices Manager/li liSystem Information/li liTerminal/li liVoiceOver Utility/li liX11/li /ul  <answer201280> In the picture of your utilites folder Time Machine, iSync and System Preferences are the three OS applications that you moved from your Mac's applications folder.  This is important for the newest versions of the Mac OS.  Earlier versions of the OS also install updates. Once installed, AFAIK you can try to move OS applications to the utility folder. If you do this, try running each application to ensure that it runs properly. All changes affect all users on a Mac.  <comment32462> I don't know if Time Machine and System Preferences are supposed to be there. But I'm on 10.6, might be different. <comment32575> Thanks that helps a lot. Let it be a notice for people - don't move Apple applications into folders, it messes it up.
