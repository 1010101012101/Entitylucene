if application "Safari" visible is false then (AppleScript) <body> I would like to check if Safari is visible, my AppleScript code was this, but it doesn't work ... How can I check the visible with AppleScript?  precodeif application "Safari" visible is false then     tell application "Safari"         activate     end tell end if /code/pre  <answer179271> Try this,,,  precodetell application "System Events"     if visible of process "Safari" is false then         tell application "Safari" to activate     end if end tell /code/pre  That will only work if it's running, but hidden, btw. If you simply want the script to 'fetch' Safari, just activate it without any check  <answer180724> First of all, the syntax of code may not be correct. This is how I would write it:  precodeif visible of application "Safari" is false then      --Do Something end if /code/pre  Secondly, an app has to be already activated to have an value for boolean codevisible/code. What you might want instead is codeset frontmost to true/code.  <comment213538> Do you mean, visible in part/full or do you mean frontmost, ie top/active window?
