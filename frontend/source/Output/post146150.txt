How to add a process to sandboxd's configuration? <body> I have a particular process that is having some problems writing to the code/private/tmp/code folder.  codesandboxd/code keeps emitting the following error:  precodesandboxd[xxx] ([xxxxx]): process(xxxxx) deny file-write-create /private/tmp/blah.ext /code/pre  I would like to understand how to set up my own codesandboxd/code rules either via codesandboxd/code's config file or by creating a new file with the permissions in it.
