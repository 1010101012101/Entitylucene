How do I disable Chrome's two-finger back/forward navigation? <body> In dev builds of Chrome, they've implemented, refined, and released two-finger swipes left/right in order to browse back/forward in the browser history. Unfortunately, you can accidentally trigger it while you're in the middle of a long down/up scroll, which needless to say occurs often.  I generally like the gesture, and things like Preview, Safari, and other application have implemented it much better, where you cannot blindly navigate back/forward so long as you have begun to scroll up/down.  How do I selectively disable two-finger back/forward navigation in Chrome?  <answer28139> The only way I'm currently of is two disable two-finger page swiping system-wide, from the Trackpad section of System Preferences. I wait patiently for Chrome to either fix its implementation, or at least provide an app preference for disabling the feature.  <answer28998> I went into the System Prefs and changed the Page change gesture from two fingers to three (OSX Lion). The three finger swipe seems to be more responsive at any rate and I'm usually only using two fingers for everything else.  System Preferences  Trackpad  More Gestures  Swipe between pages  <answer33010> strongSummary:/strong  It looks like Google Chrome uses Apples default gestures, so by disabling Apples gestures you disable Chromes. However, you probably still love some gestures like I do. For that get BetterTouchTools (BTW, its Free).   strongDisable Google Chromes Gestures/strong  You can disable chromes gestures by going to System Preference  Mouse OR Trackpad  More Gestures  and uncheck Swipe between pages.  strongKeep the Gestures You Want/strong  I still love gestures so I downloaded BetterTouchTools which allows me to make the gestures I want. I disabled all apples gestures then created my own. You can get very custom with gestures this way. Or if you prefer, leave some of apples gestures on and use BetterTouchTools for the more custom ones.  <answer80163> I know its over a year later, but I had the same question, and then figured out the answer myself.  Open terminal and type:  precodedefaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE /code/pre  Then restart Chrome.  Now you can have it enabled system wide, and just disabled for chrome. By the way, this works for any app, just replace com.google.Chrome with the bundle identifier of the target app.   If your interested in how it works, the AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls is the global setting, that can be overwritten for any specified app.   Hope this helps someone in the future.  <answer93049> Chrome Canary users should use:   precodedefaults write com.google.Chrome.canary.plist AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE /code/pre  <answer173826> I also tried the terminal command on Yosemite, it didn't work for me.   And then I tried uncheck "Swipe between pages" in mouse settings, and it worked.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tR723.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer176166> There are two different properties, one is for the strongTrackpad/strong: codeAppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls/code, the other is for the strongMouse/Magic Mouse/strong: codeAppleEnableMouseSwipeNavigateWithScrolls/code.  So you need to execute one or both of these commands:  precode$ defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableMouseSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool false $ defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool false /code/pre  <comment23251> This sounds like a poor implementation on Chrome's part. Have you considered filing a bug? <comment23252> Actually, I just tried to reproduce this and it doesn't seem to be happening for me in the latest dev build. Are you sure you're up to date? <comment23259> I'm on the latest dev build and I can confirm this error.  I would file a bug with the Chrome team.  http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list <comment23344> If you don't have to be on the dev version, it's less sensitive in the beta channel <comment23376> That's not a suitable answer by virtue of the fact that (in theory), any other channel will eventually have the current state of the dev channel. <comment46025> great, this works. <comment52803> ...this works, though you're also changing the setting for every other app (including Preview). I like this solution and it's what I'm doing, but I'm hoping the Chrome people will read this thread and see that they need to offer a fix within the browser. <comment76839> How do you enable the Swipe between pages gesture for other applications?? The gesture is missing in the BetterTouchTools. <comment76850> @PetrPeller Each application should have its own keyboard shortcut for swiping between pages. In BetterTouchTools you can setup custom gestures for each application. Setup an new application, use whatever gesture you want for a swipe, then enter that applications keyboard shortcut for the gestures action. Make sense? <comment76863> @zechdc But that way I would have to set up every single application separately and I would miss the animation as the gesture would be translated into keyboard shortcut. It's a pity that the BetterTouchTools can't just disable the 2-finger swipe gesture for Google Chrome and leave default behaviour for different apps. <comment76878> @PetrPeller I agree. Sorry I can't be of more help. <comment92503> Oh yes. Oh my god yes. This is EXCELLENT. It helped me, NOW. THANK YOU! <comment113282> I want to create a hundred accounts just to keep upvoting this answer as many times as humanly possible. <comment114939> Also works for Mountain Lion. <comment126879> This no longer works. Chrome 30 on Mavericks. The other system preferences solution does work: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/28998/8041. <comment129927> Works for me on Mavericks without the `.plist` <comment131468> How to make it automatic? (For me it works, but after system restart I need to do it again.) <comment139914> You never need the .plist. Can you remove that part of the answer? <comment169881> During my testing the com.google.Chrome.canary.plist should be com.google.Chrome.canary. <comment185967> IMHO this is a better solution than changing the Chrome defaults with the command line command. <comment188772> Works in Mavericks when the command line option did not. <comment192162> Tried this in Yosemite and it doesn't seem to work (even after restarting Chrome). This is super annoying - especially when I am entering information (say, writing an answer on SE), and scroll to check something - it's rather easy to end up going back, and losing your edit. Does this answer need an update for Yosemite? <comment208086> We need to be able to control this behavior in the web app (We're building an app that has a horizontally scrolling layout)... <comment209681> This worked for me in Yosemite and Chrome 41 - but I was trying it with a magic mouse so had to use @fredy-muñoz answer... <comment235720> Works fine in Yosemite also. Some people might like the swiping/gesture stuff but I don't really, so I changed it to three-finger swipe (which should avoid false positives). <comment237989> Worked for Chrome 44 in Yosemite 10.10.4 with a Bluetooth Logitech mouse. <comment252831> So much better! Worked for me on Chrome Version 45.0.2454.101 (64-bit) on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5. <comment255487> It didn't work for you since you are using a Magic Mouse, and not a Magic Trackpad. Note @Fredy-Muñoz's answer. The instructions in this answer disable the feature *for all apps*. If this works for you, great. However, in my post / the original Question, I asked about selectively disabling it for Chrome. See the accepted answer or Fredy's for more information. <comment257255> This stopped working for me, but then I realized that Chrome was in the middle of an update and needed to be restarted (`Chrome`  `About Google Chrome`  `Relaunch`). <comment263579> I don't expect them to ever fix this.  They've been arguing in favor of an even stupider mis-feature for years, where hitting the [delete] key will go back a page if no fields have focus.  From a usability perspective, Chrome is a steaming pile .  It's main redeeming factors are (1) a superior Inspector, and (2) more and better extensions.  Otherwise it would be worthless. <comment269754> For Yosemite + Chrome latest stable 47.0.2526.106 (64-bit):  `defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE`   works perfectly for me after restarting Chrome.  (Note previous answers mentioned  `defaults write com.google.Chrome.plist AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE`  but the extraneous `.plist` suffix made it a NOOP.) <comment288286> Awesome! Works for Safari too!!! `defaults write com.apple.Safari AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE`.  Just what I was looking for. Two-finger swipe is also for horizontal scroll and scrolling in a text area that contains an oversized image can initiate the "back button" which obliterated my work filling out the form. Not cool. They should make it 3-finger or something at least. <comment292057> It's also easy to do if the page is wide and you are simply trying to scroll all the way back to the left. <comment292085> 100 million times ^ <comment294957> Can you disable the two finger horizontal swipe gestures on a per app basis with BetterTouchTools, i.e. to disable this for Chrome only, but still use it in Preview.app, Safari, etc? If not, with which other tools or with which config file tweaks or command lines? <comment294959> Thanks for your hint! I love the two finger gesture for navigatin the browsind history and used it ever since. But now, as I used floor planning web apps such as http://community.planningwiz.com/ and http://www.homestyler.com/floorplan with their 2D/3D views, where the gesture is used for view panning, I had triggered the history back action accidentially way too often, which was annoying as it always exited the app back to the home screen and thereby discarded my work... So I needed a temporary deactivation while working with these apps. Thanks! <comment295158> @prog You cannot disable system default gestures with BetterTouchTools. You can only add additional gestures. My recommendation is to disable Mac's default gestures, then create your own. You can create new gestures on a per app basis. For example, you can setup a swipe action in BTT to use the `CMD` + `[` hotkey which will make safari go back in history one page. Does that make sense? <comment297904> You saved my day.  Command option didn't work for me in El Capitan <comment304677> This worked for me after I restarted my computer. <comment319116> I know this is the opposite of what the question asked, but I just used this to enable two finger swipe to go back by switching FALSE to TRUE like so: `defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool TRUE` <comment335920> Works on El Capitan and Chrome Version 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit). Had to completely quit Chrome and restart it. No system reboot needed. <comment349941> love this option, gestures are useful, it's just a conflict when I'm scrolling horizontall and I reach the boundary, so it thinks I'm trying to navigate. I've changed it to a 3-finger swipe, so I still have a quick gesture. Thanks! <comment364723> Still working on Sierra (10.12.5) and Chrome 59.0.3071.115. Thank you!
