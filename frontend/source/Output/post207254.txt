The audio files downloaded, file not found in phone <body> The audio files which get downloaded in WhatsApp where does it go? Can I see it visually on my iPhone?  Every time I have to scroll down to play back the audio sent by the user.  Can anybody help me on this?  <comment249921> Most programs put downloads in the 'Downloads' folder. Not there? <comment249924> In i phone we dont have download folder <comment249948> There's a method here - https://7labs.heypub.com/mobile/export-save-whatsapp-audio.html but it requires an app purchase. <comment249949> Thanks for the suggestion but I would love if i dont need to download an app to see it, is there any way? <comment249952> presumably, if there was a cheaper way, the linked method would have mentioned it, or there would be other methods on Google
