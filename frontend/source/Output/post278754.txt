Panasonic earphone-with-mic output not working <body> I have Panasonic earphones, which used to work perfectly till a couple of days back. I haven't changed any settings recently but now my Macbook Pro (early 2015) doesn't recognize it as an output sound device. The input from its mic is working fine though. Also, I have a steelseries headset (USB) which works perfectly. Any ideas?  Should I try resetting PRAM settings? I am skeptic about messing things up with this.  <comment350847> The first thing you should try is testing the earphones on another device (a phone, another computer).  If it doesn't work there, then you have narrowed down your issue.  As for resetting your *NVRAM*, there's nothing in there that has anything to do with your headset.  However, resetting it won't have any deleterious effect on your system. <comment350848> @Allan It works everywhere else, my windows PC, android and other macbooks... <comment350849> That's good info to put in the original question.  Next step is to see if it recognizes any *other* output device.  Do you have a cheap set of speakers you can try?  You may have a problem with the audio jack on your MBP.
