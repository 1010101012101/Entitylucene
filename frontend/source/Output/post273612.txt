Fink installation: After installation (I believe): -bash: fink: command not found <body> I want to install "fink"to my new MacBookpro,  when   precodeThe core packages have been updated. You should now update the other packages using commands like 'fink update-all'. /code/pre  I assumed that fink has been successfully installed, but when I tried to follow the instruction call the command:  precodefink update-all  -bash: fink: command not found /code/pre  Is this expected?  Or did I do something wrong?  Any information is needed to do the trouble shooting, please let me know.   <answer273633> Check that this line  precode. /sw/bin/init.sh  /code/pre  has been added in either code.bash_profile/code, code.bash_login/code, or code.profile/code. If the search comes up empty, then add the line to one of these files. If you are not sure which file you should use, then add it to code.bash_profile/code. Open a new terminal session and codeinit.sh/code will modify your PATH variable.  <comment344024> I added this line to `.bash_profile`, and `source .bash_profile`,`fink update-all`, `Password: Scanning package description files.......... Information about 10116 packages read in 1 seconds. No packages to install.` I guess it worked, TKS!
