How do I get system_profiler output from a lot of machines in a network? <body> I need to have a script that will execute "system_profiler -detailLevel full" command in a remote mac machine. While this is going on, the user on the remote machine should not know that there is something happening.   I tried the following applescript:  precodetell application "Terminal" of machine "eppc://&lt;ip address of remote machine&gt;"     activate     do script "system_profiler -detailLevel full &gt;&gt; /$HOSTNAME.txt"  end tell /code/pre  This activates the terminal app on the desktop and hence a bad idea, as user working on that remote machine is interrupted. I want this to happen in the background.  I want a shell script (not an applescript) that will take the name of hostnames from a text file stored on the same location where the shell script is. It will then go to each host from that list of hostnames, execute the system_profiler command and copy the text file having the output of the command ($HOSTNAME.txt file) back to the machine from where the shell script was executed.  The file copying should be done without ssh,scp etc.  <answer137128> For reading a text file of hostnames into an AppleScript list, see Read textfile into list in Applescript.  For looping over hostnames within your AppleScript list see An AppleScript list iterate/loop example:  precodeset myList to {"Hello", "Goodbye", "I must be going"} repeat with theItem in myList   say theItem end repeat /code/pre  h2do shell script/h2  To avoid launching strongTerminal.app/strong, use the strongdo shell script/strong command:  precodetell machine "eppc://&lt;ip address of remote machine&gt;"     do shell script "system_profiler -detailLevel full &gt; /tmp/sysprofile.txt" end tell /code/pre  This can be run without launching a supporting graphical application.  I am assuming you can not access the remote host via secure shell, only via Remote AppleEvent access codeeppc/code.  h2Returning the File/h2  Read the contents of the file within your AppleScript's codetell machine/code block and save it locally outside of the codetell machine/code block.  Alternatively, have you considered transferring back the system profile file via codessh/code or codescp/code? Consider having your AppleScript to connect to your Mac and copy back the collected system profile.  <comment162859> Why do you not want to use `ssh`, `scp` etc? Might be difficult to access remote systems otherwise on shell level. <comment163222> yes i understand. What i have come accross that there are commercial products like SAM tools, which gather data from remote mac systems without authentication prompts..Hence i want to do it with scripting. SSH.SCP would require authentication everytime i connect to a remote machine. <comment163224> There is some kind of authentication/autorization required irregardless of the tools used (even for Applescript). `ssh` and friends won't require additional authentication once you've set up public/private key pairs for all connections required.
