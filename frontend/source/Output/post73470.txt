Can I rescind the choice to share data about my iTunes library contents with Apple? <body> I installed the new iTunes 11 on my Mac and I accepted to share my iTunes library with Apple. There were some initial welcome screens and I opeted in when I started the new version of iTunes the first time.  How can I cancel this sharing of data with Apple?  <answer73471> In iTunes, you can opt back out of sharing details by opening the preferences and selecting the store preferences tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fk80r.png" alt="iTunes store preference"  <comment85364> Perfect!
