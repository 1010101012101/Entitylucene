Connect DualShock 3 (PS3 controller) and MacBook Pro 13" late 2013 on Mavericks 10.9.2 <body> The steps I have taken to connect my dualshock 3 controller with my MBP are shown here: http://theultralinx.com/2014/02/connect-playstation-3-controller-mac-os-mavericks.html  The controller doesn't show up as PS3 Controller in my devices list ever. Just some cryptic hexadecimal numbers flagged with 'not connected'.  Here is a log from when I  - turned on BT   - connected the controller via usb  - disconnected the controller from usb  - pressed the ps button (at that point the 'enter passcode for ps3 controller'-window comes up, but nothing ever happens thereafter)  precodeMar 28 03:43:52 Otzebook kernel[0]: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][SuspendDevice] -- Resume -- suspendDeviceCallResult = 0x0000 (kIOReturnSuccess) -- 0xb000 **** Mar 28 03:43:52 Otzebook coreaudiod[279]: PowerState:1 bluedXPCConnection:0x7f83b07419e0 Mar 28 03:43:52 --- last message repeated 2 times --- Mar 28 03:43:52 Otzebook blued[11079]: hostControllerOnline - Number of Paired devices = 0, List of Paired devices = (     ) Mar 28 03:43:52 Otzebook coreaudiod[279]: PowerState:1 bluedXPCConnection:0x7f83b07419e0 Mar 28 03:44:22 --- last message repeated 1 time --- Mar 28 03:44:32 Otzebook kernel[0]: en0: BSSID changed to 1c:7e:e5:95:9f:46 Mar 28 03:44:42 Otzebook blued[11079]: Removing Bluetooth configured device: 00-1e-3d-de-ee-38 Mar 28 03:44:42 Otzebook kernel[0]: [0xffffff80203a5700][free]() Mar 28 03:44:42 Otzebook kernel[0]: ### ERROR: opCode = 0x0406 (Disconnect) -- send request failed (err=0x0012 (kBluetoothHCIErrorInvalidHCICommandParameters)) Mar 28 03:44:42 Otzebook coreaudiod[279]: XPC method:BTDeviceDisconnected Mar 28 03:44:42 Otzebook kernel[0]: en0: BSSID changed to 1c:7e:e5:95:9f:46 /code/pre  The controller just stops blinking after some time and is still not connected / paired.  Has anyone any idea on why this doesn't work? Or some further ideas on how to debug this problem?  <answer135658> What i did was plug in my PS3 controller with bluetooth settings open then once the controller was plugged in i turned off bluetooth turned it back on and reset the controller, after i reset the controller i pressed the ps button and hey presto it was connected  <comment165448> Same here. You need the cable to pair. <comment165449> You need the cable to pair. <comment165450> remove the link, describe what you did.
