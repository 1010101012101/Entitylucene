Mac Automator Mail file as attachment and move file afterwards <body> A folder of our server is continuously filled with csv-files. All of those files has a unique prefix for any of our customer (Customer-ID). We want to send those files to our customers as E-Mail-Attachment and trying go perform that with an Automator Action. For any customer we want to build an automator Action that takes all files with a specific customer ID prefix, sends them as E-Mail to a given Address and then move that file out of the folder to another folder e.g. "Processed Invoices" or "Trash". Currently we build up something like that:br/  1) Get Specified Finder Items (The folder containing the files)br/ 2) Get Folder Contentsbr/ 3) Filter Finder Items (All Files that starts with CustomerID)br/ 4) Get Value of Variable "prefix-attachment" (Save Files found in step 3)br/ 5) Create new Mail Message (Create Message and attach files saved in Variable "Prefix-attachment"br/ 6) Send Outgoing Messagebr/ br/ ...this is working great. But I can't figure out how to move that file that has been sent as attachment to another folder. I tried to use:br/  7) Get Value Of Variablebr/ 8) Move Finder Items to Trashbr/  But I cannot "connect" those two steps. If I connect Step 7 with a batch script printing out the content of the Variable, nothing appears, as if the variable would be empty. Are variables deleted after the first directive that ignores the output of a previous executed action?  Is there any way to reuse the former created variable or to move the previous filtered files to another directory?  Thanks and Regards,  Ren√©  Automator Task
