This is the link  <comment359861> Is iTunes installed? <comment359865> Yes, I have installed it. <comment359885> How can I fix it? Could you help me? <comment359904> @Jonny-89   It would be helpful (and correct) to provide a summary to the solution here, and not via link to an Italian language page. Its great for you guys if you both speak Italian but you are leaving a lot of users out of the loop. <comment359914> @rebusB is correct. While there is no problem sharing/posting the link, as a minimum we always encourage answers to briefly summarise what's on the linked page (regardless of its language). This is best practice because links can break over time, so by including a summary your answer will continue to help users in the long term.
