Xcode Server Continuous Integration - disk quota exceeded <body> My servers main disk where all the server data is stored has over 35gb of free disk space. No matter what I do I keep getting "Error Could not write to /Users/xcodeserver/Library/Caches/XCSBuilder/Bots/....." Disc quota exceeded (-1).  Any thoughts?  <comment347824> What have you already tried to resolve the problem yourself?  Knowing this will prevent people from making suggestions that you've already tried. <comment347825> I've tried everything from reinstalling, reseting xcode server, etc.
