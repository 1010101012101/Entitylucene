iPad browser that looks like desktop to website <body> There are sites that sense the iPad is a mobile device. For example, Spotify. It will refuse to play in an iPad browser, while it works just fine on a laptop. It appears to be sensing what browser is in use, as do many sites that push a mobile version instead of the standard site.   Is there any workaround for this?   Additional note - Thanks for the answers so far. The desktop version requires Flash. This may kill the Spotify success, but great for sites that don't use flash, so I hope this Q&amp;A helps others.   <answer100331> Yes. Use a browser that allows you to change the user agent. Two examples are:  ul liAtomic Web Browser /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z7JVZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ul liTerra./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bivvd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer100360> If you already have Chorme for iPad, you can use its "Request Desktop Site" feature:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6veib.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's how it works on Android, I'm assuming it's very similar on iOS.  <answer209717> Safari on iOS now has a request desktop site feature. Use that or view it on a browser that lets you change the user agent.
