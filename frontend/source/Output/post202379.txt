“Unable to unmount volume for repair” message from reformatted SSD in “Option/ALT startup” using bootable USB <body> I am trying to reformat a Samsung 512GB Pro with bootable USB, and I have manage to get through the prep for the USB. But after the "Option/ALT startup" i click on the USB to begin with and when the "Install OS X" page i get the "Unable to unmount volumet for repair" message.  strongInfo about the MBP:/strong  2012 model  Used Yosemite when in function  Intel Core i5  4 GB RAM  2,5 GHz  strongInfo about the SSD:/strong  1-2 years old  Applied with, 1 patriot, OS Extended (journaled), GUID.  Wiped clean, 448,5 MB remains.   strongFailed attempts:/strong  Repairing the disk in Disk Utility, same error.   Using code "hdiutil eject disk0" and others in terminal to force the disk to unmount. Message back "Unable to unmount "Disk0" resource is busy".  Removing the SSD from the MBP and connect it to an iMac. Repairing worked, but when reinstalled into the MBP same error occurs.
