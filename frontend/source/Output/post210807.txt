How do I fix Apple Music "Cloud Music Library is not responding"? <body> After Apple System Status showed an iTunes outage today, my iCloud Music Library in Apple Music stopped working on my Mac. I saw the following dialog repeatedly:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zko1n.jpg" alt="Dialog reading &quot;The shared library &#39;Cloud Music Library&#39; is not responding. (503)&quot;"  I have no control over the firewalls in Cupertino , so how can I fix this?  <answer210808> After wrestling with this all day, even after iTunes status showed normal, I found this solution:  ol liOpen iTunes./li liPress kbd⌘/kbd-kbd,/kbd to open the Preferences dialog./li liUncheck bShow Apple Music/b, acknowledge the dialog advising you you will stop using iCloud Music Library, then select bOK/b./li liReopen the Preferences dialog./li liCheck bShow Apple Music/b again as well as biCloud Music Library/b, then select bOK/b./li /ol  This will restore iCloud Music Library.  Note: I could not immediately add music to my library after this without seeing more errors, but the next morning I found my add attempt had succeeded and everything seems to be in good shape.  <comment256774> When you finish step 3 does iTunes commence deleting all the music you downloaded to that Mac? <comment256921> @bmike I don't download music to my Mac—only stream it—so I don't know the answer to that question. <comment256923> aah. So you wouldn't be looking at the storage caches or the local downloads then. Thanks!
