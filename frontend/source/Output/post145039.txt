How can I access my scanner directly without going through System Preferences? <body> Since my printer has scanning capabilities, the emPrinters &amp; Scanners/em pane in emSystem Preferences/em has the em"Scan"/em tab available. This is the only known place to start and scan one's document.  I am looking for a quicker way to access my printer scanning window. searches for AppleScript and Automator solutions did not helped me.  Am I that bad a searching? The smallest hint will be appreciated.  <answer145041> Preview.app has some built-in scanning functionality you might try.  Open up the program, then go to codeFile / Import from &lt;Your Scanner&gt;.../code if your computer finds any nearby scanners (attached via usb or over a network should both work).  <answer145042> The Image Capture application can do this for you. Just connect your printer and launch the application. It comes with OS X.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aSRAu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Image borrowed from: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4505. You can also find instructions there under the heading emHow to scan/em.  <comment170878> Thank you, I might also type in _Spotlight Search_ the name of my printer wich will bring up the necessary interface with "scan" top-right of the window.  I now have the necessary info to search for a way to create an Automator/appleScript that 1-click-scan my document; maybe you can enlighten us with a nice resource for that.. <comment170879> although your solution is a totally valid one, i chose @Koen-van-Rhee 's answer as it is just a tad easier/faster to work with. <comment170892> @Buscar People's votes are their own.
