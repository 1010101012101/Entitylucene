Using Lightning headphones in my Dell laptop <body> I have an iPhone 7 with Lightning headphones. I got a connecting adapter to use 3.5mm compatible headphones on an iPhone 7. But, is it possible to use these Lightning headphones on the 3.5mm jack of my Dell laptop? I tried Googling and haven't found any converter/adapter.  <comment366688> Basically, you're looking for the reverse of [this cable](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter). Apple doesn't sell it, and people [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7661700?start=0&tstart=0) indicate it would cause a loss of signal quality.
