MBA to 2 HP monitors <body> I have macbook air ( 2014) and I want to connect 2 27" HP Monitors. I have thunderbolt to HDMi converter and then also bought HDMI splitter but it only mirrors the monitor. If I buy USB to HDMI converters, would that setup work or no?   <answer254102> According to EveryMac     *Although Apple only reports that this model can support a single external display up to 2560x1600, Intel reports that this model can   simultaneously support two external displays up to 2560x1600 "daisy   chained" via Thunderbolt.   So, no - only one monitor over HDMI. Two If you can daisy-chain compatible Thunderbolt monitors.  <comment316284> You can't use USB to power a monitor.
