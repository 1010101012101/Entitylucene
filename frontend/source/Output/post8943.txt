Is there a Quick Look plug-in for ZIP files? <body> Is there a Quick Look plug-in that works with ZIP files, and that lists all the files contained in the archive? It is also fine if it lists at least some of the files.  <answer8946> Well, Better Zip  does a fair job.  <answer276381> WinZip installs one but BetterZip's is better, although includes an advert for BetterZip each time you use it.   <comment9505> Also, check out http://www.quicklookplugins.com/ for more great plugins. <comment320160> [homebrew](http://brew.sh) + [cask](https://caskroom.github.io/)  users can install the QuickLook plugin with `brew cask install betterzipql`. <comment347832> Welcome to Ask Different!
