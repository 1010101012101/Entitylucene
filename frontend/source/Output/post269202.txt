Illustrator CC window opens behind my dock <body> In normal situation my dock is on the left side of the screen in non-hidden state. When opening illustrator it actually opens the illustrator window as if my dock would be on the right. See the different situations in screenshots added.   I know I can easily readjust window by clicking the green-resize button, but I want my Mac to remember this, and not press it each time I open Illustrator.   I'm on a Macbook Mid 2012 with osx Sierra.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YLwcF.png" alt="situation after opening" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xypa5.png" alt="when dock moved to the right"  <comment338178> Do you have now (or have you ever had) an external display connected? <comment338289> I have had external displays connected, but before I did a clean re-install. None connected right now. <comment338318> I just tested with Photoshop 6, and the Dock covered the window as you show with Illustrator. I grabbed the top of the document window and moved it to the right so the Dock didn't cover it. I then closed the document window, and opened the new one. The window opened correctly, unblocked by the Dock. I quit and restarted Photoshop and opened a new document, which was unblocked by the Dock. As a final test, I restarted the Mac and now the Dock never covers the document window. Perhaps the simple act of moving the document window to the right a bit sets Adobe apps to respect the Dock. <comment338497> When moving a window, closing the document and opening a new window; everything goes as planned. The window is unblocked by the dock. But the moment I quit and restart Illustrator, a new window opens, blocked by the dock again. <comment338565> Very odd. I downloaded Illustrator 6 onto my machine, and had the same (positive) results I found with Photoshop. I have no idea what is causing your problem. I'm not using Adobe CC, just Adobe CS6. <comment338736> Ok, thanks for trying anyway!
