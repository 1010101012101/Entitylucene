OS X 10.11, El Capitan, regularly almost freezes when Safari is open <body> On OS X 10.11, El Capitan, Safari regularly almost freezes. It usually happens on the same sites: Gmail and YouTube. I have to kill Safari and sometimes I even have to reboot the system.  Sometimes it happens when I have too many tabs open and closing them helps (it takes about 10 seconds per tab thanks to freeze).  I am not sure that the problem is in safari because I had the same problem with Chrome (once or twice, cannot really tell as I do not use it often).  So, basically I know nothing about the problem and have no idea how to solve or analyse it. I saved screenshot of codetop/code output in one of the "bad moments", so maybe someone can find out the cause?  precodetop -o cpu /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ragc5.jpg" alt="top -o cpu"  It looks like something is wrong:  ul lithe amount of faults/li lithe number of stuck threads/li lithe percentage of codekernel_task/code command (it goes up to 90%)/li li29M of free memory.../li /ul  Any ideas? It happens regularly but I cannot reproduce it consistently.  Sorry for bad English and poor description of the problem.  <comment300422> Check Activity Monitor to see if anything is not responding. I often have issues with Flash Player freezing in Safari, causing the whole browser to freeze until I kill Flash.
