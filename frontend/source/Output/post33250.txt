Is it possible to search mail for strings? <body> Is it possible to perform advanced searching on the native iPhone Gmail client? Search for mail containing "some string" or mail sent by, from?  <answer46860> Yes, yes it can.  You can do any search that gmail supports:  codefrom:myemail@mydomain.com "searchtime"/code produced the following search results (which are correct):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WDo6a.png" alt="enter image description here"  Examples of what you can do:  codesubject:(Search Term)/code  To exclude a term you can do:  code-Windows/code  And pretty much anything normal Gmail supports.  <comment54987> This is an iPod UI.  I see no search magnifying glass icon on the iPhone.  So unless I missed something, the answer does not help. <comment55008> @P.Brian.Mackey Interesting, I'll need to check on my Mom's iPhone and update my answer.
