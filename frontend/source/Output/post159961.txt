Change OSX encryption filevault password to match login pass <body> When I first setup my OSX laptop, my filevault and user login password were the same. At bootup, I only had to login once (with my username and password).   I recently changed my OSX password but my filevault / disk encryption password was not changed. Now I have to login twice when I boot up (first with my old pass, then with the new one).   Is there any way to change the disk encryption password so I can be in sync with my login password?  I tried Disk Util  File  Change Password, but it is greyed out.   <answer165241> It is supposed to be automatic, however I have encountered this during the Yosemite upgrade.  I'll explain how I fixed it.  For the sake of discussion, I'll use strongAUserName/strong to refer to the user whose password is out of sync.  Generally speaking it's quite simple. Remove strongAUserName/strong from the list of users that can unlock this disk, then add them back.  IMPORTANT, if you do not have multiple users who can unlock the disk, add one now, or have the recovery key handy.  Here's what you do:  ul liClick the strongFinder/strong icon in the Dock  /li liClick strongApplications/strong  /li liDouble click strongUtilities/strong  /li liDouble click strongTerminal/strong  /li liIn the terminal window, type the following:  precodesudo fdesetup remove -user AUserName /code/pre  You'll be prompted to enter your password.  This removes strongAUserName/strong from the list of unlock users. Next,  /li liClick the strongPreferences/strong icon in the Dock  /li liClick the strongSecurity/strong icon in preferences  /li liClick the strongFileVault/strong tabbr There should be a warning message that "Some users are not able to unlock the disk"  /li liClick the "Lock" icon at the bottom of the window and supply administrator credentials./li liClick the strongEnable Users/strong button  /li liClick the strongEnable User/strong next to strongAUserName/strong  /li liClick strongDone/strong/li /ul  <answer178843> Just bumped into this issue too, if you change password via      Settings  Users &amp; Groups  Change Password ...   you will be prompted twice, once for the File Vault original password and again for the new account password.  However if you change the password via      Settings  Security &amp; Privacy  Change Password ...   both will be updated, noting that you will be required to enter the account password not the File Vault original password, so you can reset the File Vault password by entering your new password three times.  <answer227477> I had similar problem. And didn't even know that was a problem. I thought it is standard to have one pass to unlock disk and another to login to the system. As to why during unlock there was unknown username and avatar I thought it was a bug which appeared after one of the osx major updates.  It turned out that my main admin user was not authorized to unlock the disk and some random/legacy user I created for test a year ago was authorized. So I went to System Preferences-Security&amp;Privacy-FileVault and authorized my main user to unlock.  Strange is that when I went to Users&amp;Groups to delete that random user it was not not on the list like it haven't existed (this is one of reasons that I thought before that everything is ok). So I created a user with the same name and only then could delete it.  Now I can unlock disk and login with just one user and enter password just once.  <comment246482> This worked for me, without having to add/remove users (only had one)
