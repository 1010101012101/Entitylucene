Force relaunch of Finder from terminal into background <body> For some reason, Finder is no longer running and will not relaunch using conventional methods.  I can, however, get it running with the following command in the Terminal:     codeprompt$ open -g     /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder &amp;/code   Despite the fact that I'm ending the command with an ampersand and passing the code-g/code flag to codeopen/code, the resulting Finder opens attached to a completely new Terminal window that, when closed, causes the Finder application to also exit.  How can I relaunch the Finder from the Terminal, ensuring that it will run in the background without spawning a new shell?  <answer89965> The open command exits after it opens Finder. Even if it didn't, closing a shell would close background processes. You could try using disown:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder &amp; disown $! /code/pre  Or codelaunchctl submit/code:  precodelaunchctl submit -l my.finder /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder /code/pre  codelaunchctl remove my.finder/code removes the job.  Have you looked at log messages or crash reports? If you have tried to load or unload code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist/code, try removing entries for Finder in code/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd{,.peruser.501}/overrides.plist/code.  <comment105640> `disown` worked like a charm.
