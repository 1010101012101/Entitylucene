Desktop background folder selections not persisting <body> Upgraded to Mountain Lion a few weeks ago, didn't have the problem. A few days ago I replaced the hard drive with a SSD and did a clean install of Mountain Lion then manually moved my background images to the new drive. I added the folders to the sidebar in the codeSystem Preferences &gt; Desktop &amp; Screensaver/code panel. After closing it and reopening it, every folder but the last selected folder is gone.  I tried removing code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist/code then rebooted and the problem remained.  Steps to reproduce:  ul liOpen System Preferences  Desktop/li liAdd Folder A to panel/li liAdd Folder B to panel/li liOpen Folder B and choose image from it to set desktop/li liClick Folder A to browse it/li liClose System Preferences/li liReopen System Preferences  Desktop/li liSee that Folder A remains/li /ul  Video screenshot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qy01PS0aT0  <comment88891> This gained traction on Discussions - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4634941
