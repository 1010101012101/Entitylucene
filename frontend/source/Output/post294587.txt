Editing a PDF in iBooks OK? <body> I have a PDF in which every page has an image that is crooked by almost ninety degrees.  Not all the same amount of rotation and some are clockwise, while some are widdershins.  I don't want to wait to put it on my iPad till after the nasty task of fixing this.  I know how to find and edit the PDF in the iBooks library.  Is there any downside to doing so?  It would be a bit of proctalgia to delete from iBooks and re-import after every edit.  I have to re-sync either way, but I do that often anyway.  <comment371826> [Proctalgia](https://patient.info/doctor/proctalgia-fugax-and-anal-pain) definition. Quite erudite, @WGroleau. <comment371869> Well, I did work in health care for ten years. <comment372073> Did you mean to say "Quite a Luddite" and get autocorrected? :-) <comment372074> Nope. I'm a writer and a sesquipedalian and cherish words I've not run across before! <comment372084> While I have no complaint with the definition you cited, I prefer the one of four syllables. <comment372098> I've already used proctalgia twice in conversation. No worries. I cited the definition for those who need to know!
