Yosemite 10.10.05 - Distorted text and toolbar in application? <body> When trying to run the bluegriffon web designer application(ver 1.7.2), on a Macbook Air running Yosemite 10.10.05, text and some menus appear distorted and almost unreadable. We've tried restoring the system fonts to default using font book and changing the display resolution and nothing seems to work. This application runs fine on a 2014 Macbook Pro 15inch running the exact same OS. Puzzled as to what is causing this.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZqvAb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment277564> Looks more like gpu caused artifacts, not from font.. <comment277643> Why only on this application?
