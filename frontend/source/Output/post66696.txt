MacBook Pro running OS X lion stuck on boot screen <body> My MacBook is stuck on the boot screen like this:  img src="https://www.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSAmQKws2pUOU3H5wF2quB5g7p7dc0uPimEGYIPWRFfyJ0-27rAVRYBQ0A" alt="Basic grey Mac boot screen with Apple logo and spinner"  I have tried multiple things such as launching it in safe mode and pressing some buttons as soon as the computer boot logo shows up.  <answer66697> This happened to me only in 2 cases:  ul liIncompatible SSD installed/li liHard drive failure/li /ul  There is a good chance that if you leave your MBP running for a few hours like that it will end-up displaying a files not found logo.  The best way to test if it is a hard drive failure is to replace it or to connect an external hard drive and install Mac OS on it.  <comment78555> You may be able to get more info about what's going on by starting the Mac in [verbose mode](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1492) -- hold the Command and V keys as it starts up, and it'll switch to a text display of the startup process (instead of just showing a spinning gear icon under the Apple).
