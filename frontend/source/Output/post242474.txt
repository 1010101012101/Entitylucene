I get notification in Mac, though App is installed in iPhone <body> There is one App installed in my iPhone, that is news App. Now, whenever I connect my iPhone to Mac, I get notification also in Mac.  What may be the reason ?  I want to get rid of this..     EDIT 1   I disable it from Preference. But as shown in the following image, I don't know why this App is shown in Mac. It only exists in iPhone.  See App named strongNDTV/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kf4Sc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer242477> strongemSafari  Preference  Notifications/em/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BLhHm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment298271> There seems to be no NDTV mac app (not on their website). Looks like you're receiving notifications via Safari? <comment298272> Could you try the suggestions here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/180820/suspicious-ndtv-notification-pop-ups-in-my-mac-yosemite-10-10
