Spotlight reports "Indexing and searching disabled" in Lion <body> Lion keeps "losing track" of Spotlight information. Directories and Applications disappear, full text searches stop working, etc. I seem to need to re-index it once a week or so.   However, now it appears to not work at all.  Running   precodesudo mdutil -i on / /code/pre  from the Terminal I get a message  precode"Indexing and searching disabled." /code/pre  I have tried trashing preference files, deleting the whole V100 folder, repairing permssions, etc but Spotlight still thinks indexing is turned off on my entire Volume (Yes have added/deleted whole disk from Spotlight's privacy preferences").  In the console I have quite a few errors that look like this  precodemds: (Error) Server: Disabled store registered for scope "/Applications" /code/pre  However, I do not know how to tell it to re-enable that scope as mdutil gives an error when I try to turn on indexing and gives an error when I try to delete the index   EDIT: I reinstalled Lion. It did not fix the problem(s) :(  <answer24414> precodesudo mdutil -i off / sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight* sudo mdutil -i on / sudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  1 - turn indexing off  2 - delete Spotlight folder  3 - turn indexing on  4 - rebuild  Does this help?  Also it seems you could use these commands:  precodesudo mdutil -a -i off sudo mdutil -a -i on /code/pre  <answer35073> I had the exact same problem, with all solutions above failing identically. Then I reexamined the directory listing for code//code and found a hidden file code.metadata_never_index/code in the root directory. I removed this file and was able to turn spotlight on again with  codemdutil -i/code on code//code.  codemds/code is now reindexing the hard disk, all looks good for now.  <answer48811> After all of the initial troubleshooting steps:   ul liRebuild the index /li liAttempt in another user account/li liDump prefs/cache and start over/li /ul  I found the issue lied in what was enabled/disabled. In terminal, I ran "mdutil -sa" and got:  precode/:     Indexing enabled.  /Groups:     Indexing disabled.  /Shared Items/Public:     Indexing disabled. /Users:     Indexing disabled.  /Users/sarah/Documents:     Indexing enabled.  /code/pre  I noticed "/Users: Indexing disabled." That's the problem there. The fix: "sudo mdutil -i on /Users". After that, it re-indexed /Users, which took significantly longer than it had before, and before it was finished, it was searching my Mail!  <answer53290> This can also be caused by getting stuck in safe mode.  To fix that, you need to reset the  NVRAM by holding down the kbdCommand ⌘/kbd, kbdOption ⌥/kbd, kbdP/kbd, and kbdR/kbd keys immediately after rebooting (before the gray screen appears).  <answer60627> I noticed this issue after my codeiMac/code installed the software update code10.7.4/code to my machine. Most of the suggested command-lines would produce code'Indexing and searching disabled'/code. codesudo mdutil -pEsav/code gave me code'datastore publishing not implemented.'/code  Below is the solution that worked:  ul liedit code/etc/hostconfig/code/li liadd the line  codeSPOTLIGHT=-YES-/code at the bottom (this line was missing)/li lireboot/li /ul  (after reboot make some soup while your machine prepares the index)  <answer110996> The other solutions didn't work for me, however the following was the culprit in my case.  Make sure your root/main hard drive isn't in the "privacy" settings for spotlight. For some reason I had the whole hard drive under the "Prevent spotlight from indexing the following locations" list.  You can access this section from System Preferences - Spotlight - Privacy  <answer157230> precodesudo mdutil -i off / sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight* sudo rm -rf /.metadata_never_index sudo mdutil -i on / sudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  A combination of the above worked for me.  Step 3 was the big one.  Got rid of the "Indexing and searching disabled." message.  Then steps 4 and 5 worked as expected.  ol liturn indexing off/li lidelete Spotlight folder/li lidelete metadata file/li liturn indexing on/li lirebuild/li /ol  <answer295484> This worked for me: Re-enable Spotlight Indexing   precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre   <comment27362> Are you using some "cleanup" tool by chance? Some of them are overly aggressive and delete the spotlight index. <comment27364> nope, no cleanup tools. <comment27379> You could try flushing your cache and rebuilt it with the following command: sudo mdutil -pEsav. The command you are running just turns it on, but it may be chocking for a different reason. How much space do you have free on the drive (how much taken)? And what are the errors you receive from mdutil? <comment27380> I second running `sudo mdutil -pEsav`. My timemachien drive was constantly being indexed. After running that and waiting for spotlight to finish the rebuild I had no more problems. <comment27382> As mentioned, that doesn't work because Spotlight thinks it is disabled. Running the above command gets me:  Indexing and searching disabled. Error: datastore publishing not implemented. <comment27383> No, when I try that on any Volume or subset of a Volume I get the following, as mentioned  Indexing and searching disabled. <comment27384> I know it has something to do with the MDS error messages in the log (mds: (Error) Server: Disabled store registered for scope XXXX) but I don't know why/how those are disabled <comment27399> Could you show us your `/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist`? <comment27403> @Ingmar - I deleted that entire folder in a futile bid to get Spotlight to recreate the index. It has never re-created it. <comment33677> @lemonginger: Step 2,`rm -rf /.Spotlight*`, fails with *"permission denied"*. I'm stuck. <comment33698> Try with sudo rm , I edited my above post <comment33819> @maggix: I'd tried that too (good suggestion), but it also fails. <comment40036> When you say that you reinstalled Lion, does that mean that you did a completely clean reinstall or did you restore data from a backup? <comment71342> I had this same problem after imaging. This solution worked for me :)! More than a year later. <comment111875> Thank you. This also fixed search in Mail.app for me. <comment200951> THANK YOU! Been trying to get this to work for a couple months on work laptop. I did sudo rm .metadata_never_index, then ran your mdutil -i on / and it said "Indexing enabled." Now I finally get the indexing graph! <comment304146> Thank you!  This fixed the issue for me as well. <comment338247> For me `mdutil -i on /` did not enable indexing at first but it was enabled after I rebooted. <comment346627> This fixed it for me as well, however the issue comes up again after I rebooted. The `.metadata_never_index` file reappeared in `/`. However, it's possible that the reason is I simply ran the command `sudo mdutil -a -i on` (without specifying `\` at the end). <comment362152> Worked for me. This was on an almost clean macOS installation. Funny it broke so fast. <comment363983> this worked for me. <comment373106> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
