Time machine: include external FAT drive <body> I am trying to backup an external FAT drive with time machine on a new WD HFS+ formatted hard drive, and I've read it is possible.  However, I find it in the strongexcluded/strong list, and I cannot remove it since it is grayed out.  Do you have any hints?  <answer248460> Your FAT drive needs to be formatted using GPT[GUID] (or GPT+MBR which is how Boot Camp does it, but it's not necessary for a regular, data only, non-Windows OS disk) rather than 'plain' MBR.  There are two utilities I know of which can change the underlying format from GUID to MBR without destroying the data - iPartition &amp; the new Paragon Hard Disk Manager.br Of the two, right now Paragon looks the most future-proof, iPartition hasn't seen an update in a while &amp; cannot handle CoreStorage volumes.    emNot an advert, no affiliation, I'm not providing links you'll have to Google it/embr Right now, summer 2016, Paragon HDM is $40 but there's a company called BundleHunt - kind of a 'Groupon' for Mac apps - who are doing it in a bundle of any 7 apps for $16. The resultant version you get registers properly with Paragon as though you'd bought it direct.  Failing that, you would need to wipe &amp; reformat the drive in Disk Utility - which cannot do the 'soft' conversion.br It emmight/em be possible to do from terminal, but that's beyond my pay-grade, I'm afraid.  <comment307905> Thanks for the pointer @tetsujin, I have a concern about this: will Windows OSs mount the drive after the switch to GPT? This is a critical point, if XP won't mount it, then I might be unable to change the partition. <comment307908> XP 64 & up can read GPT disks, but not XP32. <comment366720> @Tetsujin What about GPT+MBR (GPT with a protective MBR)?
