Parallels: Make sure VMs never start automatically at program startup <body> If I quit Parallels when there are virtual machines running, then these machines are automatically started the next time I start Parallels.  Is there any way to make sure that Parallels emnever/em automatically start any VM at startup?  I have already set the "Start Automatically" setting set to "Never" for all my VMs. (Its under "Virtual Machine  Configure...", and then "Options  Startup and Shutdown"). But this is not helping.  I'm using Parallels Desktop 9 (Build 9.0.24251).  <answer154834> Please enable codeOn Quit: â˜‘ Disable Resume for Parallel Desktop/code in Parallels Desktop - Preferences - General  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jha2D.jpg" alt="Parallels Preferences"
