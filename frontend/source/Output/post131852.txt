How do you force a 5 GHz wifi connection? <body> Wifi networks are often set up in dual-band mode, with the same SSID served on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. I'd like to always use the 5 GHz band (due to interference with Bluetooth and other devices that degrades performance). How do I force Mac OS X to use the 5 GHz base station? (I do not have admin access to the network, so I can't just assign the 5 GHz network a different SSID.)  Note that this question is not asking how to force a particular flavor of 802.11, rather it is asking how to force a particular frequency band.  <answer131884> The only other alternative to using different network names that I've heard of is using iStumbler to manually select the 5GHz signal to connect to.  <answer135369> I've spent some time on this issue and can attest that the only way to force a computer to the 5 GHz band is set up the 5 GHz band with a separate name.  Otherwise, the computer will auto connect to 5 GHz if it's close to the access point. At 15-20 feet away depending on obstructions, the computer will connect to 2.4 GHz if you use the same SSID for each band.  Apple tech support says that's the way it is, but you could certainly contact them to see if anything has changed recently...  Sorry.  <answer135479> In short: you can not force a frequency band in OS X 10.9 Mavericks. (On 10.5 you can...)  You want to connect to the device using Basic service set identification (BSSID) instead of regular Service set identification (SSID). Connecting to a BBSID will connect you to a specific device regardless of the connection strength. Connecting to SSID will connect you to a specific network name, if similar network names are available it will connect to the best signal/noise ratio. It must be noted that your OS X chooses the wlan, not your router, and OS X switches to the strongest signal available (2.4GHz or 5GHz).  To find a specific SSID and BSSID combination, you can run:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport scan /code/pre  Before OSX 10.6 you could connect to a specific BSSID using:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport --associate=XXX --bssid=YYY /code/pre  Where XXX is the SSID/network name and YYY the MAC address of the base station you want to talk to.  On OS X 10.6 and beyond it is no longer possible to connect to BSSID directly. There is no known API for this and no third party Software exists that can do this. So you need to change your 5GHz SSID to a unique name or you need to go back to OS X 10.5, or you can change the 2.4GHz channel from within the router. I think these options are non-valid in your case.  strongUPDATE/strong As maxim points out, you emcan/em force a frequency band and use that to fix to 5GHz.  On linux you can use codeiwconfig/code, but this tool is not available for OS X.  <answer143922> There are some apps (like WiFi Scanner) that will let you join the 5GHz band in case Mac OS chose the 2.4GHz one.  <answer188708> Simple, get a router with support for band-steering. It will take care of moving your 5Ghz devices (if advertised in capability) to 5Ghz bands.  <answer189091> Why not use the same SSID, but give different password for 5GHz, vs 2.4GHz, that way you know what you are connecting to :D  <answer195616> Most devices choose the strongest signal. So set the 5GHz AP(s) to maximum power and then just diminish the broadcast power of the 2.4GHz AP(s) until 5GHz is emseen/em to be preferable.  The price you pay is that any 2.4-only devices will have even more problems with congestion. But perhaps escaping congestion on most devices is worth that.  <answer202085> This is a partial-temporary solution. Basically, if the frequencies are on different channel numbers then it is possible to "set" the particular wifi band (worked on OSX Mavericks). steps:  strong1./strong Find the channel numbers of 5 GHz and 2.4 Ghz. Are they different? if yes proceed to step 2.  strong2./strong Set 5 GHz channel number using strongairport/strong command.  Detailed instructions:  ol liOpen Wireless Diagnostics.app (it is located in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications)./li liIn the application menu select Window-Utilities (or press cmd+2).Utilities window should appear./li liSelect WiFi Scan from Utilities window and press Scan Now button. This will show you all available networks, info about them and your active connection./li liNow, verify that BSSIDs of 2.4 and 5 Ghz with the same network name are on different channel numbers. If so, then most likely you can change the band by setting the channel number of the desired frequency band. Alternatively for steps 1-4, just type in the terminal  precodesudo System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport -s* /code/pre/li liOpen the Terminal.app and type:  precodesudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport --channel=**num** /code/pre  where **num** is the channel number to set. This command will only work under administrator account (so make sure that you are log as an Administrator i.e. emsu YourAdministratorAccount/em)/li liYou can check your active connection by re-scanning with Wireless Diagnostics or Alt+Click on the WiFi icon on OSX the menu bar or use the terminal :-)./li /ol  That's it!  P.S. If you can not set the channel try to turn off the wifi device before using the airport command.  <answer209447> Lets say you want to use the same SSID on both radios (bands). This is important if you want your devices to communicate (say a printer is being shared on the 2.4 GHz via Bonjour). On the router management software, you may have the option to control how devices associate with the radios (bands). On DD-WRT for instance, you can enable MAC level filtering (allow/permit a MAC(s) or block/prevent MAC(s) from associating). In my setup, I have only allowed (Permit mode) one old legacy Apple airport to connect to my 2.4 GHz SSID. This forces the newer clients to connect to the 5 GHz radio even if the 2.4 looks tastier (better signal). Elegant enough for me. Here's a nice link on how to only permit certain devices (note, you will see both interfaces on your router): https://snaz.com/adding-security-to-your-wifi-network-with-a-mac-white-list/  <answer210659> My work need me to force my Macbook Air to link at specific channel of 5GHz and for some reason, I can't use emairport/em utility achieve that.  My workaround is using strongemAirtool/em/strong to force my Macbook Air wireless interface to work at specific 5GHz channel or 2.4GHz channel and channel bandwidth (20Mhz/40Mhz).  It works as my expectation and maybe it can solve part of your situation.  My Macbook Air is running OS X 10.10.  <answer252567> For 10.11.x, because the options for controlling the Broadcom driver are limited, you will want to first disable roaming,  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airport.opproam disabled -bool true /code/pre  Then make a mesh out of maybe 1/2" chicken wire and stick it over your laptop to penalize the 2.4 GHz signal. Once you are able to connect to the 5 GHz AP,  precodesudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I /code/pre  you can remove the mesh and hopefully OSX will not switch BSSID.  http://www.compliance-club.com/archive/keitharmstrong/990810n.gif  <answer276797> strongSolution with 2.4ghz/5ghz network with same ssid./strong  If you are already connected to the 2.4 ghz network, you can set just the channel on your airport card, works in latest version of macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (2017-03-19)  precodesudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport --channel=52 /code/pre  I've set the channel 52 which is used by my 5ghz network.  <comment155026> I tried to use iStumbler (both v99 and v100), but double clicking the network name only brings up a signal strength graph. I saw no way to join a selected network. <comment157252> Forcing 5 Ghz implies you have to use the 802.11n or 802.11a or 802.11ac - they are synonyms for the same physical characteristic. It's be like saying asking for a black color and choosing another word for the same color (hex #000000), no... <comment157253> No. A router may already be configured to only provide 802.11n (or 802.11ac), and it may provide it on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands simultaneously. An 802.11 protocol is not synonymous with a frequency band. <comment157257> then let's reopen this and just keep the link to the other question - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23935/can-a-macs-airport-card-run-802-11-n-g-b-or-a-only <comment159777> Is changing the ssid of the 5GHz signal an option? The Asus router I connect to let me use a different ssid, and I just select that as the network I remember. <comment159778> Nope. I don't have admin access to the router. <comment160008> Do you have proof that OS X is choosing a poorer-performing network? Is it possible your mac is choosing 2.4 GHz because you actually do have a more reliable signal despite interference? <comment160028> Bluetooth performance is empirically degraded (e.g. jumpy mouse, audio loss, observed irregularities in Bluetooth data inspector) when the laptop is connected to a 2.4 GHz wifi network, no matter which network. Packet loss and latency also increases on 2.4 GHz wifi when connected to Bluetooth devices. <comment169552> Could you provide links to the 'some apps'? <comment178474> Just as a side point - in case it wasn't already obvious, holding down Alt when clicking the wifi icon will show you which band you are on.  "Wireless Diagnostics" is also pretty good for general information (Cmd-2 for diagnostics), and also "System Information" can yield some comparative data. <comment233600> As indicated in the question, I don't have admin access to the network/APs. <comment233863> Oh, good point. And I take it the network admins will not "break" the 2.4GHhz network in order to make devices migrate. <comment251510> Thanks. I was unable to set the channel. Tried turning off wifi as well. Did anyone get this to work? <comment252639> The question explicitly indicates that I do not have admin access to the network. Also, tangentially, it is not necessary to use the same SSID on both radios as long as both radios serve up access to the same subnet (which is the case for most consumer routers). <comment252651> Can you ask for this to be done for you (by someone with Admin rights)? I only posted this answer because others may be wondering how to setup their home routers to achieve your end desire. I'm using my Macbook like this at home (it has no access to the 2.4 GHz radio because it is in deny all unless in the filter). <comment252654> I also suspect you checked on the Apple support forum and found no solution. The base OS X software will probably not allow this modification easily. Tangentially, good luck. <comment257342> This didn't work for me either on Yosemite. <comment268217> System path wrong in first command, also remove the * from end. <comment268218> Changing channel in Airtool shows error: "This operation cannot be done while connected to a network." Disconnecting, changing channel and reconnecting causes it to default back to original channel so this doesn't help. <comment292519> Did not work for me either on El Capitan. <comment334690> Combining this with the answer from @maxim (specifically point 5) I was able to list all of the access points found, and then change to the 5GHz band by setting the channel. This worked in macOS Sierra. <comment358364> Unfortunately, does nothing for me (also on Sierra). The `-I` reports I'm on channel '11' both before *and* after issuing the command with a different channel. <comment367129> I see, I am kind of misunderstand his point. <comment373203> This is a nice work around!
