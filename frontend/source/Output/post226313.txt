How do log out of Twitter in Safari? <body> this is taking me more minutes than it should be, i can't log out of twitter. I'm using safari browser on an apple computer. UGH. can't twitter make this easier? it says you should go to "Me" tab and look for a gear icon but when i go to "Me" there is no icon. I tried going to settings but still there is no option or icon that says "log out".  This should be simple but twitter is making this confusing.  <answer226315> Just click on your profile picture on the right of the search field and choose the last menu item (emLog out/em)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ahw4o.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment334389> How is this an Apple problem and not a Twitter problem?
