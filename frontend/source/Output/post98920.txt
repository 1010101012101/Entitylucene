Duplicate archive subfolders with Mail.app <body> I have a strange problem with Mail and I cannot understand if it's a bug or not.  When I archive a message, Mail creates duplicated subfolders. They are called "On my Mac" and they are located under "Archive" folder.  All the subfolders, 4 in my case, contain the same message. This is quit strange since if I delete a folder, I cannot find the message anywhere else (i.e. the message is deleted in the other ones).  Here a discussion on Apple forum where it appears to be an unresolved bug: Duplicate Mail archive folders.  I'm running ML 10.8.4 and Mail 6.5.  Any suggestions?  <answer103721> I've had this problem for quite some time.  I did a completely new install on a brand new machine and still had this problem.  Here was my solution.  Back before Mail had an archiving feature, I had a folder called "Archive" that I used to put mail that matched certain rules.  strongThe presence of this rule caused a folder to be created with that name./strong  This must have cause some electronic version of confusion.  When I removed the rule and deleted the folder one more time, I was left with a single Archive folder.  <comment116273> Is the duplicate folder still there when you go off line with mail? <comment116483> @Buscarì›ƒ Sorry for the delay. Yes. Non chance to remove that additional folders. Thank you.
