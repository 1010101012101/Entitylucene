"Cannot connect to iCloud" when attempting to purchase additional storage <body> I have received a note that I'm consuming the free 5 GB space on iCloud. I'm trying to purchase 20 GB of space. When I try to do that using my iTunes account I constantly receive the message "emCannot connect to iCloud/em".  What should I do?  <comment172084> Thank you Tetsujin. I have tried this in the last hour or two... I tried it again now before sending my response and it worked! Problem solved, thanks again!
