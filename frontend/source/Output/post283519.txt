How can I make a Bash/Curl/Whatever script run when there is a new notification? <body> How can I make it so whenever a new notification reaches the Notification Center on macOS a script will be run and I will be able to get the contents of that notification through another app/script?  <comment357452> What do you mean by "get the contents", what exactly do you want to do with the notifications? <comment357453> This appears to be an [x-y problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem). The content of the notifications is created by other apps (iTunes/Parallels and many more), so why don't you collect the content there? <comment357454> @patrix The body of the notification and the title <comment357455> @klanomath I really need the script to collect all notifications from the notification center. <comment357458> This still doesn't explain what you want to do with the title/body once you got this information in the script. Mail it to somebody, write it to a file, have your mac read it aloud, or something else altogether? <comment357461> Related: [How can I log all notifications?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208168/how-can-i-log-all-notifications) <comment366684> @patrix Writing it to a file would be greatly preferred.
