Make macOS look like a Linux desktop <body> I have been developing under GNU/Linux systems for the last 10 years. Unfortunately my company is going to move developers to macOS systems soon.  Although for most of the part I should be ok (after all, people use programs, not Operative Systems), there are a couple of problems that I need to solve, most of them around having a desktop similar to the one in Linux Mint (Cinnamom), but actually anything looking like gnome2 would do.  Is it possible to install a Linux-like desktop in macOS (or maybe configure macOS to look like a Linux desktop). Essentially I am looking for a simple bottom bar with a couple of links to main applications and a list of opened windows (see image).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ku0PY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is this possible?  I have searched for this, and what I tend to find is the opposite process, how to make Linux desktops look like macOS desktops...  <answer293796> Have a look at ubar. It gives you similar style task-bar.  But if you really want to get benefit from macOS, check out these great tools: Launchbar, iStatmenus  For discovering other useful utilities, checkout Macupdate  <comment370765> It does not have to look exactly like linux mint, but is it a least possible to have a theme with a normal app bar instead of the osx one? <comment370776> Alfred 3 is a nice Launchbar alternative and, in my view, easier to use and more comprehensive. That said, Launchbar remains free and Alfred, while free for basic functions, requires a purchase for the "good" stuff! <comment370786> What are main differences in LaunchBar and Dropzone?
