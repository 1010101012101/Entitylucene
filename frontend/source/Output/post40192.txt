How can I tell exactly what keys are being pressed on the Mac? <body> At the moment I'm trying to remote control my machine and command and ctrl do not seem to be working properly.  Is there some type of 'keyboard sniffer' functionality so I can see exactly what is and is not being received?  <answer40199> I don't know if the built-in keyboard viewer is sophisticated enough, but it should highlight pressed keys.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XklnN.png" alt=""  If you do not see those options, make sure it is checked off under your strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LjHlP.png" alt="enter image description here"  There are also apps like Keycastr that display bezel elements for pressed keys.  <answer40260> The application Key Codes from Many Tricks, available for free from the App Store, displays the key code, unicode value, and modifier keys state for any key combination pressed on your computer. If you need more extensive information than that provided by the Keyboard Viewer, you might find it helpful.  <comment208165> I tried Key Codes and it doesn't work for media keys. <comment263253> I was looking for the same thing, It's called "keystroke visualizer".
