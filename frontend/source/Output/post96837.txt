Upgraded my iPhone from 3gs to 5. How do I move my audiobooks onto the new iPhone? <body> I just bought a new iPhone but own a small library of audiobooks bought through iTunes that are on the old phone.  I sort of assumed I could simply redownload the purchased books onto the new phone as the userid is the same, but it seems like iTunes wants me to buy the books again.  Can anyone tell me how I can move the audiobooks from my old phone onto the new one?  <comment113636> How did you backup your old phone, did you sync it to iTunes? <comment113638> I might have several months ago, I'll check it out.  I thought iCloud was the new official backup method?
