How can I get zsh to show the current path in the prompt? <body> I am not able to see path of my current directory or even username in terminal while using zsh. I was able to see it until few days back. Now it just shows blank. I tried uninstalling oh-my-zsh but it dint work. If I switch to bash, then I can see path. I have tried restarting my mac as well but no luck.  Currently, terminal looks like below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9hU6.png" alt="Current terminal"  Until few days back, it used to look like below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1da4K.png" alt="Terminal with path bar"  Below is my .zshrc  precode# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation. export ZSH=/Users/vishalsingh/.oh-my-zsh  # Set name of the theme to load. # Look in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ # Optionally, if you set this to "random", it'll load a random theme each # time that oh-my-zsh is loaded.

Let's get you a temporary bash-like prompt in your current zsh session.  precodePROMPT='%m:%1~ %n%#' /code/pre  Your omz installation is hosed. I recommend that you uninstall it. Install it again, if you want to or read the following sections of the zsh manuals.  precodeman -P 'less -p "EXPANSION OF PROMPT"' zshall /code/pre  to craft your own custom prompt in your .zshrc and if you are interested in themes  precodeman -P 'less -p "PROMPT THEMES"' zshall     /code/pre  <comment310309> Where exactly to you want to see the current path? In the Windows/Tab title, in the shell prompt or somewhere else? <comment310311> I added screenshots.  I want to see path in shell prompt on each line like the second screenshot. <comment310349> Can you post the content of your .zshrc ? I looks like you have PROMPT THEMES enable. <comment310352> Posted content of my .zshrc <comment310358> I uninstalled omz, still no luck. Uninstallation changed my default shell to bash. I changed it back to zsh and still the same problem. <comment310359> .zshrc file is blank now.
