No retina display, but you can replace the optical drive and use a 2nd HDD/SSD instead./li /ul  <answer189417> Current-production MBP and MBA (Air) laptops have replaceable batteries and storage.   If you really mean "user-replaceable" then we have to go back to the  MacBook (no pro) models of 2008. It's pretty easy to identify - flip it over, if there is a very obvious latch (aluminum) or coin-slot release (plastic) then you can change the battery in 30 seconds with no tools and the drive in 5 minutes with a common screwdriver.  Newer models have the battery completely inside the case. You will need 2-3 different types of screwdrivers, some rather specific (but quite cheap) electronics tools and about 30 minutes to swap out the battery and/or storage. Longer if that model has the battery glued to the case.  The 2015 Macbook (the super-thin one) does not have user-replaceable anything. The battery is glued to the case, and the storage is soldered to the logic card (it's too small to be called a "board") so you are stuck with whatever you ordered. But unlikely it will need anything for 5+ years.
