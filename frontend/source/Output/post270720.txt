Search within current document in Preview when multiple documents are opened in the same window <body> Since preview doesn't support tabs, I open all the documents in a single window and switch between them using the Table of Contents window, where all the opened documents are displayed.  The problem is that when I do a search within a certain document I get results from every opened document, which is insane and default behaviour. Can I disable this and search exclusively within the opened document?  I still can't believe Preview doesn't allow tabs in any case. Answers only relating to the Preview.app, please.  I'm running macOS 10.12.2 (16C67)  Thanks folks  <comment340231> Which version of macOS is running? What do you mean by _Please only PREVIEW related answers._? <comment340271> see edited post. By only Preview related answers I mean please do not recommend me to use another pdf viewer. <comment340314> I made a minor edit to incorporate your clarification to my question. Unfortunately, I've not been able to find out how to to make Preview do what you want.
