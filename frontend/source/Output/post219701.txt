Refurbished phone prompts me for previous owner's password <body> I recently received a replacement iPhone 5 from my insurance provider, sealed in Apple refurbished packaging (and they maintain that the device came directly from Apple).   After doing a factory reset, I receive the following prompt containing what I presume is the previous owners email address:  Enter the Apple ID password for *************@gmail.com (inluding the App Store, iTunes Store and iBooks Store).  I can skip this, but I think it's pretty concerning that I'm seeing their info. Out of interest I performed a few more resets (including one using my MacBook) and I still see this prompt every time the phone goes through the set up process. The phone is running iOS 9.2 and Apple support state they haven't seen this before.  It's not a show stopper, but any ideas on how this can be removed?  <answer219704> You might have some oddball combination of a serial number that's still enrolled in either Apple's DEP or Apple's Activation lock.  I don't know how to check DEP other than by calling Apple support and explaining your situation and asking them to explicitly check to inform you whether that device is or is not enrolled in DEP. https://www.apple.com/business/dep/ If the device was enrolled, presumably it could be pushing that user's account credentials to your device, but that's a really a remote possibility in my experience.  You should be able to check activation lock yourself at:  ul lihttps://www.icloud.com/activationlock//li /ul  Some advice:  ol liIt's really your insurer's responsibility to deliver you a working phone. Even if they tell you to go to Apple - do that and then go back to the insurance company and ask for a proof of purchase. Apple requires written documentation of the original purchaser to bypass activation lock. If this device is somehow still locked - you might get locked out./li liKeep in mind that Apple won't divulge private information about others - so be clear you are not asking them to tell you emwho purchased or locked or enrolled/em that device - just that you are uncomfortable using the device with someone else's account in it and you need their help establishing whether it's locked in Apple's records correctly or erroneously./li liGet everything in writing and consider writing a letter to the insurance company so you have it documented that you had this issue and tried to resolve it./li liApple refurbished products come with warranty service - so you should be able to also see when that device was purchased by contacting Apple or using this web form - https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do Then ask the insurance people when they purchased it from Apple - the dates should match./li /ol  hr  If you wanted to power off the device, you could try wiping it from iTunes or erasing all content one last time, but it seems you already did that and clearly the device is retrieving the account information from Apple's servers during the activation phase. Good Luck and please make an answer here when you figure out what happened or if this was just a bug in Apple's records that got fixed without you needing to do anything.  <comment265703> Odd - if you go to settings - what version of iOS is running on the device? You might also want to tell the insurance provider to provide explicit support or replace the device if it doesn't match Apple's out of the box screen shot sequence... <comment265704> It's running 9.2. Unfortunately my insurance provider has stated that as it's a sealed, official, Apple refurbished unit, I need to discuss this with them.
