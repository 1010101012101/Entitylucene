App that allows iPhones to share information while overseas without a plan (and no data) <body> I need an app that allows a number of iPhones to exchange information between each other during an event that there may be no WiFi available while myself and two buddies travel overseas.   None of us plan on 'roaming' while overseas on our current plan, we strictly plan to either stick together, or communicate through wifi. But what happens if we get separated in a city and need to communicate when wifi is not available, like a walkie talkie function  Traveling in Europe.

It uses iOS 7's mesh networking capabilities to achieve this.     Now you can chat with people around you – even if there is no Internet   connection or mobile phone coverage.      Whether you’re on the beach or in the subway, at a big game or a trade   show, camping in the wild or at a concert, or even travelling abroad,   simply fire up the app with a friend or two and find out who else is   there.
