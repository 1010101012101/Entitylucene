Phantom clicks on MBP 2014 when lid is closed <body> I have this weird issue with my Macbook Pro mid-2014, that whenever I close the lid of my Macbook, sometimes when I wake it from sleep I'll see from 2-10 new apps that are open.  I can tell that this is an issue with the trackpad/cursor, because all of these apps are in the dock, and usually the ones that are open are all next to each other in the dock.  One time, I had an Excel sheet open, and I woke my Macbook to see that it had duplicated a cell 900 cells down as well.  It's likely that the lid is triggering the trackpad, but I'm not even sure how to start searching for a problem like this.  Has anyone encountered this problem before? Do you think I should send it in for repair?
