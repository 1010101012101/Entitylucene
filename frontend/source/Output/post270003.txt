Whatsapp web option not displayed in WhatsApp iPhone <body> I have an iPhone 4S with WhatsApp.  I install WhatsApp Web on my pc. It starts, and displays a QR code.  I'm supposed to use my iPhone's WhatsApp to scan the Qr code. The menu item to do this is supposed to be in "settings". When I open "settings" I don't see the option. It's supposed to be below "tell a friend".  http://imgur.com/sDy0U9f  What do I need to do to get the option to appear?  NOTE: The option should be appearing in the iPhone software "WhatsApp"; it is missing from that software as installed on my device.  <answer270006> It seems that you have an old iOS version on your iPhone. In order to use WhatsApp Web, you should have at least iOS 8.1 installed on your iPhone.
