Scrolling to the bottom of 500 emails <body> Is there an easy way to scroll up and down in the left hand pane in e-mail? I have my ipad set to display 500 emails and its a pain to get from an email at the bottom of the list to one back at the top again. There is an indicator bar that goes up and down as you scroll but you don't seem to be able to drag it. Please help.  <answer92700> A fast way to get back to the top from anywhere in the list is to tap the status bar above the list. This works in many places throughout iOS, like Safari, Notes, etc.  The only fast way to the bottom, though, is to swipe as fast as you can!  <answer166277> You may type top to go to the start or bottom to go to the bottom. You may even type the month or year of the transaction.   <answer250819> Just tap above the where inbox is written and you will be taken to the top  <comment108715> This is true. iOS is designed with "inertia" scrolling. While there is no way to instantly get to the bottom of a page like one can do to the top, scrolling (or better, "flicking") quickly will allow you to reach your destination speedily. <comment194872> Where does one type the named commands? <comment311579> Hows does this differ or improve on the other answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/92700/237
