Get OS X Notification Center State From the Command Line <body> On OS X 10.8, users can disable Notification Center for a single day. Is there a way to check if it is enabled from the command line?.  <answer59576> Probably the best way I can think of is to install terminal notifier and send it a message from the terminal.   h2Install Terminal Notifier/h2  Terminal notifier can be installed through Ruby Gems   Type:   presudo gem install terminal-notifier/pre  h2Send NC a message/h2  Type:   preterminal-notifier -message "The notification center is running" -title "NC Status"/pre  If notification center is running you'll get a message that says "The notification center is running"  <answer59578> At the moment, the ways to interact with Notification Center programmatically (including via the command line) are pretty limited. As InfluenceJamie noted, there's terminal-notifier, which allows you to emsend/em notifications from the command line, but sending notifications is pretty much all programs can do at the moment. From my reading of the developer documentation, programs can only send and get information about the specific notifications they send, no status information for Notifcation Center itself, or other notifications. There's also no Applescript interface.  So at the moment, you're limited to manually testing whether a notification goes through, as InfluenceJamie suggested, or hoping that someone figures out Apple's private APIs and makes a command line interface.  <answer69760> You actually can find out if the Do Not Disturb is currently enabled or disabled.  Notification Center drops a plist in the following location that you can read the value of. Run the following to find the plist file:  precodels ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.*.plist /code/pre  Now, you can read the value from the plist you just found by using:  precodedefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.8D3EA20D-8D7F-52E2-9F99-BC17A13A3F0E.plist /code/pre  NOTE: your actual filename may be different than what I have listed above.  You will see a key called "doNotDisturb" and it will either have a value of 1 or 0 (enabled or disabled)  You can also change it's status by doing:  precodedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.8D3EA20D-8D7F-52E2-9F99-BC17A13A3F0E.plist doNotDisturb 1 /code/pre  or:  precodedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.8D3EA20D-8D7F-52E2-9F99-BC17A13A3F0E.plist doNotDisturb 0 /code/pre  To make the change take effect, you'll need to restart Notification Center by typing:  precodekillall NotificationCenter /code/pre  I've actually written a very simple Automator script so now I can enable/disable the Do Not Disturb for Notification Center with a keyboard shortcut.  Very handy. :)  <answer278688> To get the emDo not disturb/em status in Yosemite, just enter the following in your terminal:  precodedefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist doNotDisturb /code/pre  <comment68611> In MacOS every preference is stored in some plist files, so there must be some "defaults read" stuff to do what I'm looking for. <comment68612> Well, that's a possibility of course, but the defaults are more for permanent preferences - a temporary setting might not be stored in the defaults. However that's probably your best bet if InfluenceJamie's suggestion doesn't work for you. <comment68619> Where should this be stored if not in a plist? <comment161939> The above worked well for me but it's a manual solution rather than a programmatic status indication so I'm not giving it a +1 as an answer to this question. It was however very useful in other respects. <comment262797> Unfortunately, setting this on/off does not work on El Capitan. <comment273223> Doesn't work on Yosemite either
