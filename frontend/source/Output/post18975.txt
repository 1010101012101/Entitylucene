how do I access iTunes Visualizer options? <body> I'm using iTunes 10.4 and under "menu  View  Visualizer " there are two options, "iTunes Visualizer" or "iTunes Classic Visualizer" there's also a greyed out "Options..." menu.  The last time I used visualizer (a while ago) there were several cool visualizers to choose from like plasma shapes, and bouncing balls, and stuff.  I don't see any of that here.  Where are these options?  Were they removed?  And why is "Options..." greyed out?  Thanks!  <answer18989> Have you upgraded to Lion?  As per this support thread it seems the extra visualizers require 32-bit mode:     Right click on iTunes.app in your Applications folder and click "Get Info". In the window that appears, click "Open in 32-bit mode" at the bottom of the "General" pane.      This is a work-around, not a fix, and I have filed a bug report with Apple.   <comment20792> Yes, I'm using Lion. <comment33935> Are there any drawbacks to running iTunes in 32-bit mode? <comment83652> Don't forget that if you are already running iTunes, you'll have to close iTunes and relaunch for the changes to take effect.
