Mavericks: User no longer owner of Home folder and content <body> One of the Users (called: The_Problematic_User) of a Mavericks installed MacBook Pro is no longer owner of the Home folder and content. Here's what we've tried to no avail:  ul lirestart computer and log in recovery mode (Command-r) and; ul lirepair disk permissions,/li lirepair disk,/li liwith resetpassword (command line),/li lireset Home Folder Permissions and  ACLs,/li lireset password,/li /ul/li lirestart computer and log in single user mode (Command-s which is root access) and; ul liStrip ACLs on all account items with: chmod -RN /Users/username/li liresponse: chmod: Failed to clear ACL on file .../li liTry to regain ownership of files and folders with: chown -R username:staff /Users/username/li liresponse: chown: username: illegal user name (where username was the user name of the user, obviously)/li liTry to assign ownership of files to root with: chown -R root:staff /Users/username/li liresponse: chown: /Users/username/*: Read-only file system (where * represents all the files and folders in the directory)/li /ul/li /ul  Another thing: when I ls -l /Users here is what I get:  ul lidrwxrwxrwt  6  root wheel 204  Feb 24 10:53 Shared/li lidrwxr-xr-x+ 12 501  staff 408  Mar 21 17:16 A_user (with admin privileges)/li lidrwxr-xr-x@ 47 502  staff 1598 Mar 15 12:03 The_Problematic_User/li lidrwxr-xr-x+ 24 505  staff 816  Jan 10 15:11 Another_user/li /ul  What is the @ doing instead of the + in the permissions of The_Problematic_User?  For info: The_Problematic_User does NOT have admin privileges  <answer125216> An erroneous extended attribute has been applied to this directory somehow, but it can only be removed using the codexattr/code Terminal command. You should take a look at a brief explanation here.  A more detailed question and answer can be found at this StackOverflow page.  <comment146548> In single-user mode, you need to use `mount -uw /` to get write access to the volume, and also refer to users by ID number since names aren't available. Check the user ID number with `id "The_Problematic_User"`. Also, use `ls -leO@ /Users` to get a more complete view of the access controls and xattrs attached to the home folder.
