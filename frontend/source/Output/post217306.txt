Can a late 2013 Mac Pro (cylinder) support dual 5K displays? <body> I know the late 2013 Mac Pro can support the Dell 5K monitor, using two DisplayPort cables from the Mac to the monitor.  Can the Mac Pro support strongtwo/strong 5K monitors simultaneously (using four cables total)?  <answer217321> Yes - three 5K displays are supported on even the least GPU endowed Mac Pro Late 2013.  While I do not have the luxury of owning this kind of a setup, the following coming directly from Apple should answer this:  Mac Pro (Late 2013) - Technical Specifications  <comment333647> I'd like to chime in that I'm currently, and regularly, pushing two 4k Dell displays, *and* two 5k HP displays (`Z27q`s), simultaneously. There's occasionally a little jank; and it's not like I'm running high-graphics-requirements video-games while doing so, but it's definitely supported and effective. (=
