Numbers: checking if cell with specific text exists <body> h2Prerequisites/h2  I have some tables with cells like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ra8Nz.png" alt=""  Also, I have some more tables like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXb1s.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  h2Objective/h2  Note the codeYES/code and codeNO/code. in the codeIncluded/code column in the codeExample Requirements/code table.  ul liYou will note that for codeJAE 101/code in the codeExample Requirements/code, a codeYES/code is to the right, because I have included it in the codeExample Semester/code table./li liConversely, there is a codeNO/code to the right of codeOME 321/code because there is no such ID in the codeExample Semester/code./li liAlso, there is codeYAE 555/code which has nothing to do with the codeExample Requirements/code table./li /ul  hr  h2Problem/h2  Unfortunately, the described scenario was a mockup; the codeYES/code and codeNO/code were placed manually by myself.  strongWhat formula do I put in the codeIncluded/code column of the codeExample Requirements/code table to reproduce such scenario?/strong  <answer243741> This formula works where A3 is the cell which contains the search string and "Example Semester::A3:A4" is the range to search.  precodeIF(IFERROR(MATCH(A3,Example Semester::A3:A4,0),FALSE),"YES","NO") /code/pre                   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWO7O.png" width="472"  <comment300287> OK, thanks! Before I give you a green check-mark, I have one more requirement: How do I have multiple cells from different tables to check? i.e. How do I make "Example Semester:: $A$2:$A$3" into something like "Semester 1:: $A$2:$A$3" AND "Semester 2:: $A$2:$A$3"? <comment300339> @SirJony Non-contiguous cell ranges are not possible in Numbers. <comment300374> Seriously!? Do you happen to know if Excel on Mac supports it? <comment300382> @SirJony You can use a comma-delimited list of ranges enclosed in {} with Excel's indirect function. <comment300385> OK, thanks for the additional information. Apple really need to up the ante on their software. :)
