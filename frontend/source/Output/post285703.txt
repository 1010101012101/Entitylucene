MacBook Pro - hard drive not appearing in Disk Utility <body> Recently, i opened my Macbook Pro (mid 2012) and it had a file with a question mark flashing. I did an internet recovery and i am currently using OS X mavericks that's on a USB. Immediately i went to disk utility, where i erased the /dev/disk0 but not the hard drive itself. disk utility isn't showing my internal hard drive and only the 32GB memory stick I'm running mavericks on. My hard drive is making a weird electrical noises and clicking. Without the USB my mac does not boot up. I can't see my hard drive in disk utility (not even in terminal). It's as if my 500GB hard drive has been rendered useless. What should I do?
