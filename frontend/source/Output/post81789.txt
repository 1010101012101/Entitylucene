Custom Scheduling of Time Machine backups <body> How can I customize the schedule at which Time Machine performs its backups?  I am annoyed by looking at the number of times I see the Time Machine backing up several MBs every hour and then the cleanup.  <answer81790> Schedule backup for every 4 hours ( 4*60*60 = 14400 )  precodesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 14400 /code/pre  Default is 1 hour ( Rollback procedure )  precodesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 3600 /code/pre  Source: http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/02/change-the-time-machine-backup-schedule/  <answer81793> I would recommend using the app TimeMachineScheduler for this, it provides an easy-to-use graphical interface, and has a lot more features than a simple Terminal-line.   Unlike typing a command into Terminal.app where a typo can potentially create problem, using a graphical user interface is safer.  TimeMachineScheduler http://www.klieme.com/Images/TMSscreenshot.png
