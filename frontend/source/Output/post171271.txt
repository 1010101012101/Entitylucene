How do I get Finder to remember the size and location of the window? <body> Why doesn't Finder remember the damn window size and location? I keep reading crap about holding down Option key while dragging but that doesn't work. It just reverts back to its microscopic size the next time i open it. It's useless and very tedious and it really aggravates me.  How do I make this thing thing stay the way I want it to? I don't mind playing around with system stuff or running scripts - so long as I only have to do it once only.  Any help will be much appreciated!  <answer171274> Actually there is a simple way to do that.  First you have to open new finder windows (not in Tabs).  Before you click on a new finder window hold the kbdcmd/kbd key (not the Option key).  Now you can resize that window or move it around and it will remember that next time you open it.  <answer171282> I've found for windows that have shortcuts, e.g. cmd-shift-h, cmd-shift-c, cmd-shift-u, etc. or any other folder in the Go menu that you can set the size and position by:  ol liClose all windows/li liOpen the window you want and set it's size and position/li liClose the window/li /ol  Now each time you use the shortcut the window will be to what you set.
