Server isn't responding 100% of the time <body> Whenever I try to use safari on my iPhone 3GS, it reports that the server isn't responding. This happens every morning, every night, almost 100% of the time.  I don't believe that the server isn't responding, iPhone 3GS. I'm not convinced.  So, what could be wrong with my iPhone? How can I fix this, and be able to get rid of the server isn't responding error?  <comment328206> Which server are you talking about? - Does it happen for any web site? - Or only for a specific web site? Is the phone connected via WiFi or over cellular? <comment328361> When I try searching into the search bar it does it, so not for a specific website. It says "Safari can't connect to the server". It happens connected over wifi.@jksoegaard <comment328401> So if you're not searching but accessing a specific web site, it doesn't give you the error? <comment328405> It happens when I try *anything*. A website, the search bar, typing in an entire URL, absolutely *everything*. @jksoegaard <comment328407> Do you have network connectivity issues with other apps? I.e. can you download email, use Facetime, etc. without lots of dropouts or errors? <comment328408> Yes, I don't have any dropouts or errors on anything but safari <comment328410> Have you set a proxy server for HTTP/Safari requests? <comment328411> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/49026/discussion-between-daniel-cann-and-jksoegaard).
