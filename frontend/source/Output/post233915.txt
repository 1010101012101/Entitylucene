Why can't I install an app (says "could not be found")? <body> I just got an iPhone SE. I did a backup from my 4, then told iTunes to restore the new phone from the backup.  It said there were a bunch of apps it couldn't install because they cannot be found.  As just one example, Access RPN is on my 4, shows in my iTunes under "My Apps", but without art. When I go to the iTunes Store link, it says "Downloaded" so I can't redownload it.  How do I fix this?  EDIT: I found an Apple page that says to do this I need an iTunes backup, AND a phone that's not set up. So I erased my SE and tried again. This got many more of the apps installed and their data recovered, but some still aren't working. Access RPN, my example app, still does not work.  <answer234774> Ok, in iTunes on the computer, it says "Downloaded". But on the device itself, go to  App Store - Updates - Purchased - My Purchases  and select the "Not on this iPhone" tab. That shows all apps that didn't get transferred. Click the cloud icon to download them.  This even preserved the apps' data, because I had done a backup first.  <answer247325> You just open the Xcode devices, and select the device and add whatever the app you need to install.. Thats all  <answer287914> On my case, the root cause* was different, and I got it fixed. The codemyapp.ipa/code file was missing and strongI recovered it from a mac backup (from TimeMachine)/strong.   I will try to be as detailed as I can remember:  ol lifind the app's location on mac  codeiTunes/code: right-lick on it to codeGet Info/code  codeFile/code  codelocation/code, to find where the codemyapp.ipa/code was supposed to be at/li liif it's not on this location on codeFinder/code, then open codeTime Machine/code (maybe you need to plug in your external HD 1st) and try to find the file on an older backup/li licopy the file to your desktop, then drag &amp; drop to codeiTunes/code apps library. A message _ _ _[empls edit here if you know its text/em] will ask you if you want to replace the app. Choose "Yes" (at your own risk)./li lion iTunes, with your iPhone plugged in, select this app to be installed on your phone as you normally would do. Done!/li /ol  hr  *possible root causes related to this fix:  ol liapp is not maintained by the developer anymore (e.g. warning-this-app-will-not-work-with-future-versions-of-ios)/li liapp available on the App Store of a different country/li /ol  <comment285874> Are all those apps still available in the App Store?  When a developer removes their app from the store you'll get a similar situation. <comment285881> Access RPN at the very least is: https://itunes.apple.com/gm/app/access-rpn-calculator/id317845869?mt=8 <comment285897> Are you sines in to the same country 's App Store and with the same ID you used when you got those apps?  Also, if these are older apps without recent updates, like Access RPN, maybe they can't run on the latest iOS version.   That's the only other thing I can think of. <comment285958> I checked with the author of RPN, he says it works on his 9.3 device. My App Store has a section called "Made in Canada" in it, so I'm pretty sure I'm still in the right App Store. <comment285966> Sorry, I'm out of ideas on this one.  Those are the only things that I know will cause the problem you're experiencing. <comment305189> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.
