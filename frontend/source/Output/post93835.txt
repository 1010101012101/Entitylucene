How to switch between different Chrome windows with keyboard shortcuts? <body> Switching between applications is easy with kbdcommand/kbd-kbdtab/kbd.  Switching between tabs is easy with kbdcommand/kbd-kbd}/kbd or kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdtab/kbd.  Switching between separate windows within an application is easy with kbdcommand/kbd-kbd`/kbd.  However, that last one doesn't seem to work with Google Chrome (Version 27.0.1453.110) on OS X 10.8.4. Is there a leopard shortcut specific for Chrome to switch between different windows?  <answer93889> kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbd`/kbd works for me with the same versions of Chrome and OS X, so it might be something specific to your installation.  You could try temporarily resetting Chrome's preferences or disabling extensions. Or change the shortcut from System Preferences or test if it works on a different account.  <answer107923> To switch between users in Chrome, use kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdM/kbd and then use your arrow keys to select the user you want and hit kbdEnter/kbd.  This isn't as fast as a key combination normally is but it is quicker than using the mouse. To see where this key combination comes from see Chrome's support forum.  <answer131745> @Hugo Chrome allows to set up more users to get more "environments" inside your chrome (bookmarks, opened tabs, session and so forth). it's very useful to split your business and private browsing.  So, kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdM/kbd is very useful. :)  <answer140841> I'm using Mavericks and kbdCMD/kbd+kbd`/kbd does not work for me. However, kbdCMD/kbd+kbd./kbd does.  <answer152458> Interestingly, the kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd-kbd`/kbd shortcut doesn't work for me (Chrome 38.0 on Mac OS X 10.9.50).  But kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd-kbdF1/kbd seems to work instead (and works for other apps too).  Though, again, it doesn't work if the windows are spread across desktops/spaces.  <answer162778> For those using Snow Leopard 10.6.8, these options can be set under the OSX "System Preferences"  Keyboard  "Keyboard Shortcuts" Tab  "Keyboard and Text Input".  Apparently, by default Cmd+` is set to "Move focus to next window in appl...". However, this shortcut doesn't work for me because my keyboard is Japanese, and therefore I need to press Shift to access the `. It turns out that OSX always receives a Shift+Cmd+@. So, what I did was to replace that shortcut with Cmd+@ and now it works.  Hope that helps people having similar issues.  PS: You can use the "Move focus to active or next window", which defaults to Ctrl+F4, Shift+Ctrl+F4 for the previous window.  <answer205951> Control + F4 will switch back &amp; forth between open chrome browsers but only after configuring the Function keys to only work with Fn key in System Preferences  keyboard options.   <answer219830> So I found what was , for me , the real problem. I went into System Preferences"  Keyboard  "Keyboard Shortcuts" Tab  "Keyboard and Text Input and I found this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T8tGZ.png" alt="Sorry for Italian lang."  Sorry for Italian lang.br/  Start from bottom, third row. Have attention for strongemcmd + '/em/strong at first it was strongemcmd + `/em/strong  So I simply changed it and now It works perfectly.   Hope this can help.  <answer230506> To show Chrome windows (this applies to other apps as well) press: kbdControl/kbd-kbd↓/kbd (arrow down).  Active windows of the current application would be shown larger (if you've multiple monitors, they will show on other screen as well), including minimized at the bottom.   From there, use arrow keys to switch between different windows and confirm your selection with kbdEnter/kbd or kbdSpace/kbd (to switch between all apps press kbdTab/kbd). It should work for multiple displays as well. Hit kbdEscape/kbd to cancel the selection.  subAbove tested on El Capitan (10.11)./sub  <answer235749> This issue is so strongannoying/strong for me, and today I finally got it resolved! So, in hope to help some poor soul like myself, I want to share what I did:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GW25i.png" alt="Screenshot"  ul liGo to System Preference -- Keyboard -- Shortcuts tab -- strongcodeMove focus to next window/code/strong/li liSet it to kbd⌘/kbd + kbd`/kbd/li /ul  <answer285455> I had the same problem and when I went in to system preferences and keyboard shortcuts the shortcut was set to cmd+. When I marked it and gave it the same shortcut, It suddenly works just fine:)  <comment110127> You're right... it does work. The problem is with OSX spaces. If I have two chrome windows open in the same space, CMD + ` switches between those windows. However, if I move chrome, or any other application, to two or more spaces, CMD + ` does not switch between those windows. I'm going to mark this as the answer since it does answer my question. I'll create a new question regarding switching between windows in different spaces. <comment131592> Chrome users? What is that? The command doesnt do anything for me <comment154804> Welcome to Ask Different!

I'm struggling with the same problem. <comment218564> This doesn't address the question asked in any way...  Would have been a down-vote if I had the reputation on this SE site for it. <comment221327> @KrisAnderson, would you mind sharing the new question you mentionned regarding switching between windows in different spaces. <comment234126> @Jehu, Hmm, there seems to be no way to switch between these "environments" when they have more than one windows. <comment257974> This worked for me.. thank you very much! <comment265126> This cycles between all windows. So it would work if you only had two chrome windows open. <comment280734> CMD+F1 does nothing. Tested in Google Chrome 48 in El Capitan. <comment280735> CMD+. does nothing. Tested in Google Chrome 48 in El Capitan. <comment319370> Doesn't show all windows if they're spread across different workspaces, which is what the gist of the problem is. <comment319380> @DanDascalescu It works for me with multiple monitors though. <comment319446> Right, but do you have multiple [spaces](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21872?locale=en_US)? <comment319572> Maybe if you hit your arrows towards another workspace, it'll switch to another? Or use the shortcuts, like Control-1 or 2, or Alt+Arrows? <comment322593> It helped me to active the last radio button option (All Controls). Because I am not always in a Text Field. <comment347243> also for reference is http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193937/shortcut-for-toggling-between-different-windows-of-same-app/193938#193938 <comment359205> Holy shit this is amazing! Thank you!!!!! <comment369286> Ctrl+Shift+Tab also allows you to switch directions between tabs.
