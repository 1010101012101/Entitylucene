How do I take screenshots and/or record debug output from Recovery Mode <body> I'm currently trying to repair a corrupted APFS volume in Recovery Mode and want to include some screenshots or copy/paste some Terminal output to then paste into a bug report. How do I accomplish this from Recovery Mode to then transfer to a working Mac on the same network to submit?  <comment368005> Take them on your phone and email/Airdrop them to yourself? <comment368006> @NoahL Ah, old school!
