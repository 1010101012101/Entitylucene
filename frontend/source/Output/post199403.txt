How to sort a playlist in iTunes 12.2.1.6 <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rol2i.png" alt="screenshot"  Ever since the last iTunes update (12.2.1.6), there's a new way of displaying playlists, where the songs are twice the size vertically, and I can't find any column headers to sort the playlist by. I want to sort the playlist by Year. It might be really simple but I don't know how to do it.  <answer199405> Switch your view to Songs, rather than Playlist, top right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/heobU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer245554> For ver 12.4.1.6 the pulldown on the right is gone.  In the menu bar click View  View As  Songs  <comment240249> Ahhhhhhhhhh Thank you
