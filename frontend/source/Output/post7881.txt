How do I do custom key binding in iTunes? <body> How would I assign   ul li⌘1 to Music (Library item) /li li⌘2 to Movies /li li⌘3 to Podcasts/li /ul  Surprisingly enough, these key bindings are not assigned to anything yet, and IMO they would be most convenient ones (see e.g. Mail.app).  I can't see any relevant item in AppleScript dictionary for iTunes…  <answer7882> Try going into Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts tab → Application Shortcuts in the left panel.  There you can add a custom shortcut to any specific application menu item. Just add itunes to the list and add your shortcut.  <answer7885> For each Source/Library item (Music,Movies,Podcasts) you want to open with a shortcut, create a new Applescript as follows  precodetell application "iTunes" try     set view of front browser window to (get some playlist whose special kind is Podcasts) end try end tell /code/pre  replacing "Podcasts" with "Music” or "Movies", and save it with to your ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts folder (if this doesn´t exist, create it!), giving it an unique name (like "show podcasts","show movies").  Next, open "System Preferences""Keybaord""Keyboard Shortcuts" and select "Application Shortcuts". Click on the little "plus" button to add a new shortcut with:  precodeApplication: iTunes Menu Title: show podcasts   —this has to be exactly the name you gave your script Keyboard Shortcut: &lt;press your desired shortcut, eg. "cmd+2"&gt; /code/pre  Now pressing "cmd+2" (or whichever shortcut you defined) while being in iTunes will open the Podcast library item.  <comment8525> There are no such items in iTunes' menu. <comment8529> @piobyz It's not the menu in iTunes. It's the global settings on your Mac. <comment8536> This does not work here, as there are no menu items in iTunes to select sources that then could be triggered from "System Preferences""Keybaord""Keyboard Shortcuts" <comment8600> Genius :-) That's exactly what I was hoping to achieve. <comment8602> Do you know any workaround for "Apps" item (special kind (none/Books/folder/Genius/iTunes U/Library/Movies/Music/Party Shuffle/Podcasts/Purchased Music/TV Shows, r/o) : special playlist kind)? <comment8612> Unfortunately, no. And if i select Apps/Ringtones and try to get their name/id, nothing returns. :-(
