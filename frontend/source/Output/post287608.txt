Finder "Arrange by date" splits into Today, Previous 7 Days, Previous 30 Days, etc <body> When I use Finder on OSX 10.11.6, selecting any of the "Arrange by date [modified/last opened/created/added]" splits up the window into various vertical subcategories which I can either horizontally scroll through or go through one by one and select "show all" to have them treated like regular files.  Is there anyway to disable this and just have all the files in the folder sorted chronologically in the same way it treats files when you sort by name? I believe the behavior I'm looking for is the same as Windows 10 behavior.   strong[EDIT]/strong  Just to clarify, I am wanting to achieve this in icon view, not in one of the other views.  <answer287700> Right Click → codeShow View Options/code. In the small window that opens, set codeArrange By/code and codeSort By/code to "None". Close the small window.  Right Click Again → codeClean Up By/code → codeDate Modified/code or codeDate Created/code.  Unfortunately, there is no equivalent option for "Last Opened" or "Added", as far as I'm aware.  <comment363167> I'm pretty sure it only does that in the 'All My Files' folder, which is a special folder type. <comment363174> @Tetsujin sadly no, i just checked and it does it in Downloads Desktop and a bunch of folders that I made on my own <comment363176> hmm... yup, it does it in anything first set to icon view before choosing that sort. As I never use icon view, I hadn't realised. I mainly use list view & then you can sort by clicking any header & that doesn't happen. <comment363178> @Tetsujin unfortunately in list view it does the same thing, even afte clicking a header to sort. http://i.imgur.com/13CzNYL.png <comment363180> Yes, but the trick in list view is to remove the View/sort [set to None] & just click the headers instead <comment363182> Oh i see. that's cool but i'm really looking for a way to do this with icon view. thanks though! <comment363184> Yup - fraid I can't help on that one, sorry. Wish you luck. <comment363325> damn this sure isn't intuitive but thanks so much !
