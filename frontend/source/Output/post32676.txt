Go to code/Developer/Examples/TextEdit/code, double click on codeTextEdit.xcodeproj/code, and click the play button.  In case you are Xcode less, let me know, I'll upload a build for you on my server.  <comment37365> Open console and watch the activity when you open TextEdit â€” it could greatly clarify things.
