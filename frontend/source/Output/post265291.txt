Can I connect Apple Airpods to a Toshiba Portege laptop running Windows 8.1? <body> Apple's Airpods promise seamless connectivity to iPhones and Macs through intelligent sensors.   At work I use my existing Apple Earpods for Skype business conference calls - as they provide a mic and earphones that are simpler and more compatible than other USB based headgear.

On my desktop (Win 7 Pro) I put the airpods in discovery mode (push the button on the back until the white light flashes) and then go to Devices.  Select add a device and wait until the list populates.  Your airpods will be there.  Click on it and let the drivers load.
