Change the Option+R/L shortcuts to Control+R/L <body> I would like to remap the Option+L/R shortcut on my Mac keyboard to Control+R/L. I don't want to use the modifier keys dialog because I only want to change these particular shortcuts. Any help would be appreciated. Bill  <answer225306> My knowledge of keyboard bindings is that it's difficult to do without installing third party applications. With that said, Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) provides a great way of customizing bindings easily, and should be able to do what you want.  <answer225314> In the first example below Option-L/R arrow does the same after adjusting the keycodes as Control-L/R arrow.  The previous behavior Option-L/R arrow (e.g opening/closing a folder in list view) is lost.  If you want a different behavior you have to modify/precise your answer.  To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;Change Option L/R arrow to Control L/R arrow&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;altlr2ctrllr&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL&lt;/autogen&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the remapping.

The previous behavior of Control-L/R arrow is lost.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Change Control L/R arrow to Option L/R arrow&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;ctrllr2altlr&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  hr  If you want to swap ctrl-L/R-arrow with ctrl-L/R-arrow then use either both of the above keycode changes or this one:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Swap Control L/R arrow and Option L/R arrow&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;swap_ctrllrarrow_altlrarrow&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_CONTROL, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment273379> Just to avoid any confusion, by R/L I mean the right arrow and left arrow keys. <comment273383> I tried Karabiner and couldn't find these particular two shortcuts anywhere. I might be just missing it, so if anyone can confirm that it is possible in Karabiner and perhaps point to where I need to go to find them, I would be very grateful. <comment273384> @BillR. That's quite possible. It may be possible to [edit the XML file](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/xml.html.en) giving you greater control. Take a look and let me know if that works. <comment273385> Thanks for the advice. I looked at your suggestion to edit the XML file but I'm afraid its Greek to me. I'll need an 'average joe' solution for this one. <comment273386> @BillR. Sorry, I'm afraid I don't know. I'll let you know if I think of anything. <comment273551> Thank you for the suggestion. Both your first and last code wont change the behaviour of ctrl-L/R. In both instances the cursor still moves to the far left and far right of the line. Option L/R behaves differently depending on the code: the first code doesnt change the behaviour, it still moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous or next word, while your last code disables option-R and changes option-L to switch to dashboard. <comment273552> Which means that I still can't program Ctrl-L/R to do what I want, namely to move the cursor to the beginning of previous and next words respectively. I'm just wondering if Apple hasn't got some built-in protection of its own keyboard. <comment273611> @BillR. Hmm the last and the second last do exactly what you want. In the last one (which is a new mod) ctrl-L/R-arrow behaves like alt-L/R-arrow and alt-L/R-arrow behaves like ctrl-L/R-arrow now. You have to disable all other mods made in private.xml in the Karabiner prefs though. <comment339042> @klanomath do you have a solution for a [similar issue](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/269844/re-assign-ctraltf-shortcut?noredirect=1#comment339036_269844) ? thanks - I don't know if this post is breaking 'stack rules' ...it's a related issue...anyway, I can remove it later on
