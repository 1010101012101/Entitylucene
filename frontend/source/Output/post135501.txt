Autonumbering in notes on Mac <body> I regularly use the autonumbering feature in Notes: starting a list with 1. and typing text and return automatically generates 2. etc.  However, occasionally i seem to be able to change the seed number for the autonumbering. Something I am doing will change the start number from 1 to 19 or whatever.  This seems to happen when I type a line number below an existing list.  ol liTest 1/li liTest 2/li liTest 3/li /ol  If I then go and type 4. underneath the 3. in a blank line it then changes the list to  ol liTest 1/li liTest 2/li liTest 3/li /ol  The trouble is that I cannot seem to do this consistently. I have just tried this at the end of a current list and instead of resetting the seed number back to 1, it adds a new line starting with 7.  Any ideas on how this 'feature' works? Would be great so I can consistently change my autonumbered lists back to starting at 1!
