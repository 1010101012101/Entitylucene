absolute path to directory accessed by right click 'Show Package Contents' <body> In OS X Mountain Lion when you right click on an *.app icon you get an option to 'Show Package Contents' leading you into 'Contents' directory.   I'm having trouble figuring out the absolute path to the 'Contents' directory for a given *.app  Thanks for Help!  <answer101357> Any .app is just a folder so if an application is in  precode /Applications/Safari.app /code/pre  the Contents directory is   precode/Applications/Safari.app/Contents /code/pre  You can also get the path by kbdCmd/kbd-clicking on the folder name at the top of the Finder window.  <answer101361> You can open the codeterminal/code app, and then drag any file or folder into it to have the full path displayed in text that you can copy/paste etc.  <comment119428> Thanks! that was easy. I assumed the .app files were not directories.
