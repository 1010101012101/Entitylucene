Any better way to purge the inactive memory? <body> Running purge command in the terminal to free the inactive memory isn't really what I think about Apple.    Lion isn't doing a great at all when it comes to free the inactive memory.br Free memory is reaching 16 MB and applications and the OS are becoming unresponsive, yet OS X isn't reclaiming the inactive memory.  After each session, I put the laptop to sleep. You can say that I shutdown my OS once a month.  Unixes after all aren't created to be rebooted.  OS X Snow Leopard was pretty sleek, I don't know but it looks it is a Lion thing (maybe due iOS brought to Lion features).    Any better way to reclaim the inactive memory on Lion?br [EDIT]br I got 4 GB of RAM  <answer48468> Probably not much better than what you are doing but I use iboostup occasionally when i wan t to free up some memory.  I constantly struggling here with 2gb MBA and i use vmaware fusion for windows machine that just takes the memory from me. It has a couple other nice features too.  http://www.iboostup.com/  <answer62337> Yes, you can, one command only (run in Terminal):  precodepurge /code/pre  And recheck inactive RAM  <answer65875> There are free apps on the Mac App Store that add a free-memory button to the menu bar for quick memory purging.  Search for "memory" in the MAS and choose what suits your needs.  Hope this is what you are looking for.  <answer138927> The real way I've made progress diagnosing this sort of issue is to use codesysdiagnose/code to profile your system immediately after boot, then again before swap starts to get written and again when you note the slowdown.  Issuing codepurge/code is not effective with OS X virtual memory on Lion and muddies the waters to find the real culprit in terms of memory leaks or paging stress.  I've found that server Macs are generally stable for 6 months or more and don't need reboots before an update will force a reboot. Client Macs running software like Office, Adobe and even some of Apple's consumer products (or Pro apps) do not run perpetually like other UNIX and benefit from a reboot once a month or so to clear memory if you have issues with swap that cannot be isolated and ameliorated by codesysdiagnose/code or other changes in usage.  <comment55522> What's your system configuration?  If, for example, you're running 10.7 with 2GB of RAM, it's likely this behavior is unavoidable. <comment72079> That is my first line :p <comment163879> possible duplicate of [Isn't Inactive memory a waste of resources?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/67031/isnt-inactive-memory-a-waste-of-resources) <comment284712> `sysdiagnose` isn't available on Snow Leopard. I'd say a busy client Mac desktop should be restarted more often than once/month, depending on how hard you are pushing it and how many apps you are using. I'm experimenting now with `purge` to see if it will do the same thing as a restart or a logout/login.
