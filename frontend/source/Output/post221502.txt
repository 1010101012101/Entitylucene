Seagate External HD (GoFlex) Crashes Macs <body> strongSituation/strong: My most important external Hard drive is crashing my computers. It had my time machine backups and random files stored. I've tried it on my iMac and Macbook Pro. It may be worth noting I installed Parallels recently.   Does anyone have any ideas or solutions? I was about to open it up. The fact that it shuts the computers down makes me think it isn't necessarily a read/write failure?  h2strongSpecs:/strong/h2  h2Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex 9ZF2N5-502/h2  iMac 3.4GHz Intel Core i7 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3 Software  OS X 10.8.5 (12F2560)  strongTried so far/strong: -Using the closest port to the power.  -Changing USB cables  <answer221821> I had this problem on many Mac OS X and OS X versions with different external hardware devices (even iPhone!). Installing the last version of OS X was the only working solution. Even with upgrading the OS X, problems remain.
