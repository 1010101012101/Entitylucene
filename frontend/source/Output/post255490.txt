SSD caching layer of network volume <body> Are there any solutions similar to a Fusion Drive, but where the large/slow part is a network volume? This would be to get usable speeds with a volume that has to be networked, and would otherwise be too big and complex to sync (intricate dependency trees with a lot of small, scattered files). I know of StableBit CloudDrive, but sadly it's just for Windows.
