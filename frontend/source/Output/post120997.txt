Mount Folder in Maverick <body> I want to mount a folder to another folder. My reasoning is: I have a free box.net account with 50GB, but it does not include versioning.

Have you investigated using `autofs` for mounting to a specific path? <comment141236> I am using the Box Sync app (https://sites.box.com/sync4/), and I would like to continue using it.
