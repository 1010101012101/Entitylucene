Disable system-wide ctrl-click as right-click in Mavericks <body> Disabling kbdctrl/kbd+click as right-click is useful because:  ol liMany web app rely on kbdctrl/kbd+click (typically for multiple selection)./li liThere is little use for this combo (mice have 2+ buttons and trackpad emulate right-click with two-finger click or clicking in the right zone)./li /ol  Can it be done in OS X Mavericks?  This question has been asked before for Lion and answered negatively (i.e. a third party utility is needed). Has this improved for Mavericks?  <answer141857> There is no system supported method for disabling kbdctrl/kbd+click from functioning as a secondary click in Mavericks.  You can use Karabiner to remap "Control+LeftClick to LeftClick," which essentially disables this behavior system-wide.  https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xoJfH.png" alt="Using Karabiner to map Control+LeftClick to LeftClick"  You can also remap it to just about anything you like.  However, I don't know of any web apps (and certainly not most or many) which don't recognize and respect kbdCommand/kbd+LeftClick as a way to multi-select. That is the standard for Mac OS X.  <answer151973> Try the kbdright option key/kbd+click  This works for me using parallels with Windows 8.1, I haven’t personally come across web apps that use this, so I can't test this.  Right click actually emulates kbdcontrol/kbd+click due to the history of apple sticking with a single button mouse for so long, thus the context menu used the kbdcontrol/kbd click method, plus Mac OS X doesn’t have a context key on the keyboard like Windows Keyboards (located on the right side of the main keyboard, in-between the kbdcontrol/kbd and kbdalt/kbd (kbdalt/kbd GR) or kbdwindows/kbd keys).  <answer167350> I found that I can use kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd in lieu of kbdControl/kbd when using online Flash training applications (I'm using 10.8.5 Mountain Lion).  <answer168318> In my VMWare Windows 7 guest, I have found (after reading this post) that using kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+LeftClick works the same as kbdCtrl/kbd+LeftClick would in a hardware Windows machine.   <answer169840> just go to Accessibility  Keyboard  Open Keyboard Preferences...  Modifier Keys  Contro (^) Key  No Action  click ok then youre done!  <answer180962> kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+LeftClick, recommended by mvreijn for VMware Windows 7 guests, works quite nicely in Citrix connections to Windows 7 machines.  <answer220170> In System Preferences-Keyboard-Modifier Keys, you can change the function of the keys. If you switch cmd with ctrl, ctrl will work with applications as ctrl without the right click.  <comment138045> Note: for the first point it's cleary a design flaw, since on OSX multiple selection if achieve with Cmd. <comment225762> What?! You can't mean that. <comment263007> Not a good idea—this just disables the Control key entirely. <comment317184> this is not the best choice if you need to use the CTRL+click for some other action, this will completly remap it, so you can;t use it elsewhere <comment317185> this is no solution... you must be joking.. this way you can;t use the ctrl key for any other shortcut ! <comment326516> What a life saver!!! Thank you!! <comment341255> Also `Karabiner-EventViewer` will help you debug keys (in my case a bug made the Cmd key always on)
