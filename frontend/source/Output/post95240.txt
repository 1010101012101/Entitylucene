terminal app on my iphone 5? <body> Which app do i use to get terminal on my iphone 5?  I got something that i thought was terminal, but im not sure. I want to modify my iphone using terminal.  I downloaded serverauditor already. Please help.   <answer95241> h3Local/h3  To use a local terminal, you have to jailbreak. At which point you would install mobileterminalsup(with cydia)/sup to access the local shell.  h3Remote/h3  For accessing other systems, you would need a ssh client sup(although you could do the above, and run ssh)/sup.  I recommend prompt.  Also, if you jailbroke your iPhone and installed openssh, you could just use prompt to connect locally; it has a better interface than mobileterminal.
