Outlook 2016 for Mac Export Broken? <body> I run an online tech-support system. My Outlook 2016 for Mac is very slow in response &amp; when I asked for advice on the issue, my friend asked me to clean up my mailboxes. However, I cannot do that because I have hundreds of emails that are important. So I tried to export the email database. But somehow the export is not working. It crashes after 3-4%. How can I fix this or is there other ways to backup Outlook 2016 for Mac.  <answer284620> Have you tried rebuilding you outlook mac identity? If you haven't, then have a go through that and try exporting your email database again. This is a manual process and may acquire your attention as well as your time.
