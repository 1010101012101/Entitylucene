Installation of Java SE 6 legacy disables audio in Yosemite? <body> I am having difficulty with the Apple Java Legacy SE 6 software update on my Mac running Yosemite. I need to install the SE 6 because I have two applications that require it.  After installing, my system audio completely goes away except for system sounds (such as the boot tone, emptying the trash can, etc). iTunes won't play my library, YouTube video won't produce audio and no video files on my computer will play audio.   I attempted several reboot solutions, including a PRAM reset but to no avail. The only solution was to cmd-R and reinstall Yosemite. This brought the audio back, but also removed the SE 6 legacy driver.  Can anyone explain why this happens and is there any trick to making this work correctly? I understand that Java7 and the SE 6 Java are in two different locations so they don't override each other. But haven been able to find a solution here.  Korky  <comment185402> What do you mean by SE 6 legacy _driver_? Java based drivers? And what are those two applications?
