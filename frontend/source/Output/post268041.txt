SSD lost size after erasing NTFS to HFS+ <body> I bought SSD Samsung 850 Pro drive  from my friend and it was NTFS formatted. I used macOS Disc Utility to erase it and after doing this the disc has 24 GB only (instead of 1TB). Any solution how to resize it to its previous capacity?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KejMl.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7HT8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268066> In my opinion you didn't buy a 1 TB SSD but a 1 TB + 24 GB SSHD (a hybrid drive similar to Apple's Fusion Drives). At least 46949230 blocks Ã  512 Bytes amount to ~24 GB.  I haven't been able to find a model though (except for an SSHD option with the same sizes in some Dell laptops).  If the HDD part isn't visible at all, it's probably incompatible with macOS' disk framework.  <comment336442> external usb case <comment336452> OK, if the SSD is no fake, the only culprit left is the case/its USB and/or SATA controller. Do you have a second external case? <comment336453> unfortunately don't have second one <comment336455> Found a similar case [Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SSD only shows 22.4GB capacity???](https://hardforum.com/threads/samsung-850-pro-1tb-ssd-only-shows-22-4gb-capacity.1906404/) with 22.4 GiB (base 1024) = 24 GB (base 1000). <comment336513> found second usb/sata case but nothing changed
