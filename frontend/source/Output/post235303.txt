Copy a movie between iPhones <body> Seems like an idiot question, but I completely failed to copy a movie from one iPhone to another.   ol liWe tried coupling with bluetooth, failed to send files./li liEnabling internet sharing (which worked) but failed to send files through Airdrop./li /ol  I understand that if we were connected to a WIFI network Airdrop would probably have worked. But we were on a trip travelling in a car, so there was no WIFI availability.  Remembering sharing photos over BT with friends ages ago using old push-button cell phones is seems crazy that we could not find out how to do it.  Can this be done? (iOS 9.3, iPhone 6 + SE)  <answer240173> On the emHome/em screen (or on any screen with something you want to share), swipe up from the bottom.  You should see a bunch of icons. Toward the bottom 1/3rd of the sheet you'll see the codeAirDrop/code icon.  Tap the codeAirDrop/code icon and 3 choices will slide-up from the bottom:  ul listrongEveryone/strong/li listrongContacts Only/strong/li listrongOff/strong/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VsiSZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  These choices allow you to limit the people with whom you can share. You both should have the same setting to ensure you can see each other.  <comment287770> Apparently AirDrop should work without you both being connected to the same Wi-Fi: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/146644/airdrop-bluetooth-or-wifi <comment287776> Thanks. We tried using airdrop symbols in the Photos app (Share-menu) in various ways but no luck. How is it supposed to work? The connection never shows up in the other iPhone... <comment287819> Did you have AirDrop setup for 'Everyone', 'Contacts Only', or 'Off'?  If 'Contacts Only' you need to make sure you're each in the others Contacts app. <comment287868> @fbara Where do I change the "AirDrop setup"? <comment287869> I can't add a screenshot from the computer I'm at.  If you're on the Home screen and swipe up from the bottom, you'll see a bunch of icons.  Toward the bottom 1/3rd of the sheet you'll see the AirDrop icon with the words I indicated above.  This allows you to limit the people with whom you can share.  You both should have the same setting to ensure you can see each other. <comment287915> @fbara Thanks I found it. I will try! <comment295030> @fbara Sorry for late reply, yes it works, please add the reply.
