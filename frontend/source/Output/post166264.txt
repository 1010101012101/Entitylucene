How do I add existing Lists/Categories from iCal/Calendar to Mac OS Reminders? <body> I am running Mac OS X 10.10.1 Yosemite, with personal data migrated from Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.5. I had hundreds of what 10.6's iCal application called "To-Do" items, in various "categories".  The strongReminders/strong application in Yosemite has what it calls "Lists". The left sidebar has entries:  precode  Scheduled On My Mac   Personal   Business   Unfiled   Untitled t /code/pre  These entries appear related to the sidebar entries in the Yosemite strongCalendar/strong application. There is "On My Mac", followed by a long list of entries that include the above four:  precodeOn My Mac   Personal   Business   Unfiled   Untitled t   Calendar Secondary     Spouse     Entertainment   To-Do current     Work t     Phone t   To-Do waiting     Tickler t     Waiting for t /code/pre  The entries in strongCalendar/strong are exactly the category hierarchy I used in Mac OS X 10.6's strongiCal/strong application, which of course handled both events (now strongCalendar/strong's job) and to-dos (now strongReminder/strong's job).  All my hundreds of to-do items are in the categories suffixed with " t" (for task). Only one of these categories ("Lists") shows up in Reminders.  However, if I click on the entry "Scheduled" in the Reminders sidebar, I see all my to-do items, with their category names (like "Tickler t").  So, Reminders in Yosemite can see my to-do items migrated forward from 10.6 iCal, but doesn't display the categories ("Lists") themselves.  I am not using iCloud, and I don't want to use iCloud. I am syncing with an Android phone, through a non-Apple solution, and there is no iPhone connected.  How can I make my existing categories ("Lists") display in the sidebar of the strongReminders/strong application? How can I make the categories ("Lists") which are for events, rather than to-do items, not appear in the strongReminders/strong sidebar?  Is there a plist or settings dialog which I can manipulate to control the contents of this sidebar?
