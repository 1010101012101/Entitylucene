Does the iPod Classic respond to the clicker buttons on the iPhone earbuds? <body> I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the iPad supports the clickers on the iPhone headphones (volume up/down, play/pause, etc). Does the most recent iPod Classic series respond to these buttons as well?  <answer1995> Yep. Check out this link on Apple's site. I'm actually surprised to learn so many devices support it now.   ul liiPhone 4  /li liiPhone 3GS  /li liiPod touch (2nd generation)  /li liiPod classic (120GB 160GB - 2009)  /li liiPod nano (5th generation - video camera)  /li liiPod nano (4th generation - video)  /li liiPod shuffle (3rd generation)  /li liiPad/li /ul
