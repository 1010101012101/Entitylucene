How do I set a custom avatar for my account profile in Mountain Lion? <body> I just got Mountain Lion. On previous versions of OS X, I could choose a photo from the filesystem as my account avatar. This doesn't seem possible under the Users &amp; Groups section of System Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fIXRL.png" alt="Screen Shot"  Any ideas on how to do this?  <answer62837> I haven't found a way to choose a photo from that popup dialog, but you can add one by dragging an image file onto the picture itself (that dialog may have to be closed for this to work).  <answer63507> You can either drag and drop an image file into the avatar selector "well" (next to the Change Password button) or copy and paste image data (open your photo in Preview, Select All, Copy. You will have to click the avatar selector first so that it's focused (has the blue border around it) before you Paste.  <answer92742> I did find the actual folder where they are stored  Click on your hard drive/library/User Pictures  I created another folder there for my custom pics and they show up just fine.  <comment72505> That's the way I did it, worked fine. But, I agree with stantonk, there needs to be a way to add an image through a dialog associated with that pop down menu. <comment73334> Thanks! I guess I should have thought to try that ;-) <comment152936> This pasting nor dragging a JPG does not work for me (OSX 10.9.2). <comment152937> @jorijnsmit Just tried it myself, dragging seems to work. You are trying to change the picture of your own account I assume (you can't do it for others without admin privileges). If you can't get it to work, please create a new question using the "Ask Question" link at the top and link back to this question here. <comment166131> You also need to have enabled changes by clicking the padlock icon so that it's open. <comment292894> WOW. As a user coming from Windows 10 all I can say is WOW.
