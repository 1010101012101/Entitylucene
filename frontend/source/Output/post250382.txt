Publishing app to the app store as application manager without developer account <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qro1Z.png" alt="Check the image."I am publishing an app to the app store for the first time. I have an apple id but do not have an developer account.  The admin added me to iTunes connect as an application manager.  Can I publish an app to the app store without developer account as an application manager? If so, then kindly let me know how do I do that.  Please explain the answer very clearly because I am new to iOS platform.  <answer250385> You can only add apps if you are at least have an agent or admin user rol.  Steps to submit a new app:  ol liGo to iTunesconnect/li liClick on 'My Apps'/li liPress the strong+/strong in the top left corner/li liFill in the details provided by your developer (Bundle ID etc)/li /ol  Now you created a new app in iTunesConnect. To publish an app you need to fill in all details of the app and let the developer upload a embuild/em . In the app details you need to link the build to your version.   <comment310868> Just to be clear, are you an Agent, Admin or Member? There is no 'application manager' role for iTunesconnect. <comment310891> I did editing and added a snapshot of what I am looking at. <comment310892> What is an agent user? <comment310898> This page might be helpful, wrt the abilities of each type of user. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/UsingiTunesConnect/UsingiTunesConnect.html <comment310900> @codename_mak Since a developer needs to add you - why not have them ask Apple Support if needed - they are paying for support as part of their dev service. <comment310901> An agent is the superadmin of the account. It can even change bank account settings and other usefull stuff.
