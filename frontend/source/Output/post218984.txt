How to make my app only on iPhone 4S and higher? <body> My app is for a smart device and uses Bluetooth Low Energy. I would like to enable my app only for iPhone 4S and higher. Is that possible ?   <answer218986> You can restrict your app to devices having certain capabilities.   In the codeInfo.plist/code file add a new key codeUIRequiredDeviceCapabilities/code with an array as value. You can put all your required capabilities in the array. In this case codebluetooth-le/code.  <comment264865> Ask on StackOverflow. Ask Different isn't for software development. <comment265006> @Arc676 Even if the answer would have been some option in iTunes Connect ?
