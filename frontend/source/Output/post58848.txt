I have:  ol lia Mac OS .DMG file/li liWindows 7 OS  /li /ol  Is it possible to make installation disk of Mac OS in Windows 7  <answer58870> it's already answered on SuperUser. You can use Transmac according to this.  SuperUser: Create a bootable USB drive from a DMG file on Windows  <answer59089> Use transmac to open the .dmg install file and open the "shared support" folder contained inside. Find the file labeled "installESD.img" and burn it to your pen drive in the format "MAC OS Extended (Journaled)"  Voila, bootable pen drive.  <answer171063> There's actually a program called Win32DiskImager, that can take the code.dmg/code file and your flash drive and make it bootable. I just used it today and got OS X working on my desktop with Windows.  <comment67768> Last I knew (but commenting instead of answering since I haven't ever tried) Windows 7 cannot read DMGs, nor HFS partitions. As far as I'm aware, this is not possible to do.
