Pages - is there any way to prepare counter for figures? <body> I'm trying to figure it out with paragraph style, but without any success...  Want to have a formula for figures (*fig. 1 , fig. 2, fig. 3, *etc.), do anybody know how to do it?  edit: Trying to figure it out with table still... don't know how to do this counter (every next table with addition '+1' for ex.: fig. 1. xxxx, fig. 2. yyyyy, fig. 3. zzzz). Maybe someone knows how to do it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3vyVx.png" alt="..."
