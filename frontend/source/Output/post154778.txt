Software for burning AAC files to MP3 CDs? <body> iTunes is lacking some features I could really use for burning MP3 CDs for the car audio system.   ol liAbility to convert AAC to MP3/li liAbility to group non-album songs into folders/li /ol  In itunes, the process appears to be:  ul lifind all the songs you want to burn to an MP3 CD/li lifigure out which songs are not in MP3 format/li litell itunes to make duplicate versions of these files in MP3 format/li lifigure out which are now the MP3 versions and drag them into a playlist/li liedit the copied MP3s' meta data to 'fake' a new album so it's grouped on the CD correctly/li /ul  Is there a piece of software that can do what I'm looking for and/or is there a way to do what I want in iTunes that I'm somehow missing?  <answer154800> MP3 CD Maker would appear to do exactly what you want.   I haven't tested it &amp; one of the reviews [somewhat illiterate, so pinch of salt may be required] said it didn't work - but it looks like it's free to try, 10 bucks to buy, so I guess you can test it first.  <answer155182> If you change the Import CD As... to MP3, you should be able to convert any non-MP3 files to MP3. The same applies to all the supported file types.  <comment182539> I'm not importing a CD. I'm trying to create a CD. Does that setting have a bearing on burning a CD? <comment182540> I will give it a try!
