iPad 4 Ambient light sensor <body> I hear the iPod Touch 5 dropped the ambient light sensor.  What about the new iPad 4? Does that device have an ambient light sensor and automatic brightness adjustment?  <answer70492> As mentioned on the tech specs page, yes it still has an ambient light sensor, and so does the iPad Mini.  <comment81899> If you linked to where you heard this, perhaps it would be worth documenting a well spread misunderstanding. As it stands a search of the documentation answers this binary question quite well. As it doesn't invite someone t answer why, it's not a good fit for our Q&A site.
