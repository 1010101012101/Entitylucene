Cannot see NAS in iTunes <body> I use iTunes to upload music onto a WDMC NAS device, then listen via Sonos. After recent upgrades to iTunes (I use a Windows laptop) I cannot find access to the NAS (though it has not affected operation of Sonos). The folder location in iTunes Advanced Preferences is correct, but there is no link. Previously, all my songs came up in iTunes, now I can only see my Apple purchases.  Any simple solutions please ? Thanks.  <comment322423> I'm not entirely sure what you're asking. Is your media physically located on the WDMC NAS device? When you say "use iTunes to upload," do you mean iTunes is set up with the WDMC NAS folder as the library location, and you have "Copy files to iTunes Media folder..." enabled, so you add it to iTunes and it gets copied to the NAS? I used a mounted volume as a media folder for a while, and I never saw a link in the preferences dialog to it, just the folder name listed there. If you can only see purchases, it means that the rest of the music is no longer in the library, but obviously that ... <comment322424> ... doesn't mean it has been removed from the NAS. If you click the drop-down menu toward the upper-left in the main iTunes window, do you see another library listed at the bottom (besides My Computer)? <comment325318> Thanks, my tech skills are minimal. I cannot see the drop-down menu you refer to. It USED to be there, but disappeared with the latest iTunes update. Before that, 2 generations of iTunes ago, my entire NAS library used to open when I opened iTunes. Now, I cannot see it at all, although new CD's loaded to iTunes seem to be going through to NAS.
