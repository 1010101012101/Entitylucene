I want to mount a virtual CD-RW drive <body> I want to export (burn to CD) some media I own and have in iTunes. However, I do not want to burn it to a physical CD. I want to instead burn it to a virtual CD. A virtual CD is something that appears to iTunes as a real physical CD but is in reality just a file on the HDD of my iMac. I prefer to do this without purchasing any software.   I know there are commercial products like Virtual CD-RW by BurningThumb. However, at US$30 or more, I can't justify the expense. In Linux, utilities like this are freely available. Surely, there must be something similar for Mac OS X; however, I haven't been able to find it. I can use the terminal and I don't mind a command line tool, as long as I can burn a playlist in iTunes to the virtual CD drive I set up.  <comment133479> Why do you intend to do with that Virtual Disk? May be there is another solution to attain what you want... <comment133527> I want to burn my audiobooks to CD (but I want to use a virtual CD). <comment133649> What do you intend to do with the virtual CD after that? For backup or for sending to a different device may be? In either case you should be able to copy the original file to another folder. You can get the file location by right clicking the item and choosing get info. <comment133723> @Nivas - you must be misunderstanding my question, but thanks for trying.
