Is it possible to change opacity of application window? <body> Is it possible to change the opacity/alpha value of a program window such as preview or chrome? I know this was possible in linux by editing some gnome shell file. Is there anything similar in OS X  <answer192003> You can use strongafloat/strong. This allows you to set the opacity of a window from the Window menu.  <comment228225> Works perfectly, thanks.
