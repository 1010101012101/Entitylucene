Screen rotation bug and reset <body> Poked at the system settings, display settings, and changed screen rotation setting to 180. Immediately after rotation setting became read only, and then after 30 seconds it crashed.  After reboot i cant'go to system setting any more, it just says to me that it cant open display settings and hangs.  NVRAM reset (options+cmd+R+P) does not reset screen rotation setting, only everything else.  So. How to do rotate display back to default? Command line options anyone?  Macbook Pro 13", 2013, OS X 10.10.2  <answer189966> To reset the System Preferences:  ul liDelete code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist/code/li /ul  If you don't see the Rotation Setting in the Displays Panel, try this:  ol liClose the System Preferences if it is open./li liOpen System Preferneces/li lioption-command click on Displays/li liYou should now have access to the rotation settings./li /ol  <answer215940> I ran into an issue where I could not load the display pane at all, even after multiple quits and restarts and PRAM resets; safe mode boot resolved it for me!  <answer259985> Accepted answer didn't work for me but the following free command-line tool did;  https://github.com/CdLbB/fb-rotate  Once compiled (see readme) just code./fb-rotate -d 0 -r 0/code  <answer266143> I bought Pivot - Display Rotation on the Apple Store and it fixed the problem.   <answer276198> I have a MacBook Pro with macOS 10.12.3, did the rotation before I read this post.  The way that I fixed it was doing a Safe Mode Restart.  Was pulling my hairs out  <comment225419> No, it can't open display settings by all means. <comment225421> Sorry, I read too fast. I updated my answer on how to hopefully reset the System Preferences so it doesn't crash. <comment225428> deleting systempreferences.plist doesn't do anything... <comment225431> You zapped the PRAM, have you booted in safe mode (hold down shift while starting up ) or logged into a different user account? <comment225432> yes, i did all mentioned things. <comment225433> but i fixed this by spending 1$ on app in App Store, which gave shortcuts for screen rotations. it worked, i rotated screen to 0 deg, and Display Settings started to work. eh.  but anyway, thank you for willing to help. <comment225437> The app you purchased must be reseting some preference, but I am not sure where they are saved. In ~/Library/Preferences/ there are pref files  `com.apple.preference.displays.*.plist` where * is a hash code referring specific display. (I assume an external display). However, on my system, these do not appear to have recent timestamps despite having just done a lot of Display changes on my own system. <comment228663> Do NOT rotate your screen using command-alt-click on the Display preference pane.

Thanks a lot ! <comment344932> andrey rodin which app was this? <comment362002> Even works on MacOS Sierra
