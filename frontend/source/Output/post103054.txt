Unsupported hack or workaround to get 64-bit OS X to install on a MacBook Pro having only 32-bit EFI? <body> I want to install the 64-bit OS X 10.7 on my MacbookPro 2,1, which has a 64-bit processor, but only 32-bit EFI and Kernel Boot mode.  I know that this is not officially supported, but I assume there is some workaround since the hardware provides everything needed to run a 64-bit OS, except for the EFI.  "Select Startup Mode" tells me, that: em"While your Mac is technically able to run a 64-bit kernel, this is not currently enabled by Apple."/em  How can I get that to work? Is there an unsupported hack or workaround?  <answer103103> I could see how there would be a possibility to work around this. I assume this would come from the hackintosh community.  However.. You might be able the core OS but then run into trouble with drivers. An example would be the graphics card. It's a GMA 950 right? As far as I know Apple never released 64bit drivers for it. So even if you get this running, you would still have only basic video without acceleration.  Reference: http://netkas.org/?p=189   <answer103693> I found a post on the subject from the guy who wrote this book about Mac OS X internals.  His post mentions Snow Leopard (10.6), but the issues would be similar for 10.7. See Mac OS X Internals - Is Your Machine Good Enough for Snow Leopard K64?  Here's the part I found most relevant to your question:     [...] Unfortunately, a 64-bit processor alone doesn’t suffice. Out of the   box, boot.efi will not boot K64 even if you have a 64-bit processor   and explicitly request K64 if at least one of the following is true.      ol   liThe machine has 32-bit EFI./li   liThe machine’s model is prohibited from booting K64 through a hardcoded list within the boot loader. (A cursory look suggests that   the list excludes "non-Pro" machines.)/li   /ol      Both of these "limitations" are technically artificial, albeit to   different degrees.      The first limitation actually does have merit and is arguably not all   that artificial. strongAlthough a 32-bit EFI could launch a 64-bit kernel,   the kernel, when running, would not be able to use firmware services./strong em[emphasis mine]/em&nbsp;   In particular, you wouldn’t have NVRAM. For kernel developers merely   wanting to run a 64-bit kernel for testing and debugging, this may not   be an issue [...]   On the one hand, the author states that the limitations may be artificial, which still indicates some promise of a workaround, but on the other hand, as @Koen van Rhee's answer also already pointed out, you may end up with devices without support under 64-bit.  (Aside: Why emdo/em you want to run the 64-bit kernel, anyway? The OS X 32-bit kernel emcan/em run 64-bit programs.)  I did some more digging searching for a real workaround of some kind, not just theory.  I found the following: OS X Daily - Got an Older Mac? MLPostFactor Installs OS X 10.8.3 on Old Unsupported Macs.  OS X Daily's article links to a series of forum posts at MacRumors - [Guide] Success! Install 10.8 on old unsupported Mac.  It is a emvery/em long thread.  I still don't definitively know if you can get the OS X 10.7 64-bit kernel running on emyour/em specific kind of Mac, but I suspect for the reasons mentioned in this image from the MacRumors forum thread that you can't: em"Problem is cards like [...] Does NOT have 64-bit Kexts [...] 64-Bit Kernel will NOT load these 32-bit kexts"/em.  Essentially, what @Koen van Rhee already said.   But then I found this. Quoting: em"Apple has included 64-bit drivers for GMA950 in the OS X 10.6.2 update. These drivers can be used to provide partial support for GMA950 under OS 10.8."/em  ... and I'm thinking: maybe such kexts exist for your card and might work on 10.7 too, if they'd work on 10.6 &amp; 10.8? You may have to hunt and mix &amp; match bits from elsewhere.  To sum up:  I don't believe there to be a single or simple workaround for your desired OS version and hardware version.  If you want to proceed, everything I've read indicates it may be possible (to some degree &mdash; accept there may be missing drivers and so missing functionality and/or poor performance), but your work will be cut out for you.  <comment121375> Just so that everyone is on the same page - a 64 bit kernel isn't the same as a 64 bit processor: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3773 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3770 <comment122147> Thanks for your in depth reply. I'll continue searching and let you know the outcome. <comment216329> I have booted 64 bit OS X 10.6.8 on a 32 bit EFI Core 2 duo iMac, by using GRUB, which I installed alongside debian. Graphics were an issue but it DID work. Maybe with the 10.6.2 64 bit GMA 950 kext, it would work better.
