When does the warranty period start for an Apple iPhone 4s? <body> I have an Apple iPhone 4s that is brand new and not activated. Has the warranty period already started for this phone or does it only start after activation?  <answer190759> As far as I know Apple stopped selling the 4s last fall. Therefore the person/reseller you bought it from might have twisted the truth. Where did you buy it? In the U.S.?  You can verify the warranty service and support coverage on: https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do  Apple Warranty starts on the date you buy it (date of purchase). Not on the day you start using it.   Apple:     strongWHAT IS COVERED BY THIS WARRANTY?/strong       Apple Inc. of One Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California, U.S.A. 95014 (“Apple”) warrants the   Apple-branded iPhone, iPad or iPod hardware product and accessories   contained in the original packaging (“Apple Product”) against defects   in materials and workmanship when used normally in accordance with   Apple's published guidelines for a period of strongONE (1) YEAR from the/strong   strongdate of original retail purchase by the end-user purchaser/strong ("Warranty   Period"). Apple’s published guidelines include but are not limited to   information contained in technical specifications, user manuals and   service communications.

If you do not need it I would suggest returning/selling the device or otherwise start using it. ;-)  <comment226539> They keep selling it here in Chile. http://m.entel.cl/movil/appmanager/movil/sitio?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=P29202550321326487955536&idMarca=74&idEquipo=102486 <comment226540> Oh ok! I didn't know that. Thanks!
