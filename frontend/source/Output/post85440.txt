Git plug-in for Finder? <body> Is there a plug-in for the Finder which lets me see and do all my git-related stuff?  It seems silly that I have to use different apps or the terminal for such things when the files are right there in front of me.  <answer97757> I'm afraid that there is no git plugin for the native Finder app.   The Finder alternative Path Finder claims to offer GIT and SVN integration, but it costs $39.95. Maybe try the 30 trial to see if it fits your needs?  <answer245071> SnailGit is close (but not free) alternative to TortoiseGit that works for mac. It does displays badges directly in Finder. And it has right-click git menu for operations on repositories.  Free version is limited to one folder.  <comment98458> Feel free to build one yourself, Windows only recently just got the very same thing. <comment98460> A plug-in to "see and do all your git-related" stuff? Really? <comment98462> I suspect you're asking for something like [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) (which integrates directly in to Explorer in Windows) but for git and Finder -- is that correct? You could frame the question a little better and, I suspect, get a good answer if this is the case. <comment302067> Looks like the closest thing to what I want at the moment, although there are issues with the icon overlay conflicting with Dropbox (I think this is an Apple limitation of only allowing one icon overlay per file/folder)
