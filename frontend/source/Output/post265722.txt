MBP won't boot after sierra update. SmartBattery: finished polling type4 <body> After an update to sierra I can’t boot my MacBookPro15 I did reinstated the system several times ( at recovery mode ) and it works fine till I restore my data from backup. ( only applications and user data ) It looks fine after restore, but once I restart it is stuck with booting. verbose mode messages attached as picture.  Can’t boot on safe mode neither.  SMC reset seems not working, as if I hold Shift+Control+Option+power it just power up same as just pushing the power button = apple logo with progress bar…  Please some advice. thank you.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P9Ckn.jpg" alt="verbose mode message"  <comment335272> Have you tried [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.
