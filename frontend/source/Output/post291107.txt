What is the "opaa7g6" for in my terminal? <body> Today when I'm taking a look at my terminal, I realized that there is a weird string in my shell prompt.  It seems that I've never seen this weird string before.  What is that for?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zXPXM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment367518> Good question, but I believe it has been asked before and the linked question explains it. <comment367671> I am sorry I didn't get it in that question.
