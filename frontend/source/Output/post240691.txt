Macbook Pro Retina stuck at boot sequence <body> I have a Macbook pro 15 inch retina with a windows bootcamp partition installed. Recently I used disk utility to repair my Macintosh HD partition, however I can no longer boot into it (bootcamp partition boots normally). The gray progress bar loads completely but the partition never boots up and it stays stuck at full progress. I attempted to correct the error by booting into recovery and accessing disk utility, however now disk utility stays stuck at "loading discs" in an endless loop. I am in dire need of assistance as this is my only computer and I rely on it heavily.  <comment297012> What if you try booting up into safe mode? <comment297041> @john ramos same problem <comment297064> Can you wipe your Macintosh HD partition? Are you backed up to a hard drive/Time Capsule? <comment298083> @JohnRamos I am backed up but I am unable to access disk utility in order to wipe the partition. Internet recovery also does not work
