Selecting half a document <body> I have an extremely long document in text edit that I want to delete roughly half of. Is there a better way to do this than selecting by clicking and scrolling?  <answer215446> If the text is at the second half of the document, go to the beginning of the text You want to delete and press kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd↓ DOWN ARROW/kbd and then delete it. If it's in the first half, go to the beginning of the text You do not want to delete and press kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd↑ UP ARROW/kbd and delete it.
