Can I use TouchID for a password in my browser? <body> I would like to use my touch ID to fill in my password at any website. Is there a plug-in for that or is it still inpossible.  Example: Facebook asks me for a log-in on facebook.com and I want that when I lay down my finger on the touch id that it automatically fills in my password.  Do I need to dream on or is there a possibility to reach this?  Thanks in forward.  <comment367804> Do you mean 1Password? I know they have touch bar support.
