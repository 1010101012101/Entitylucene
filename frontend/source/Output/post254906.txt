Hide external drive to non-admin users <body> I've configured an external drive with the right permissions to forbid user access (codechmod 700/code to my user). But although they cannot access the drive, all users can see it in finder and desktop. I know I can configure finder to hide external drives, but I don't want that. I just want to hide this particular drive.  Is there any way I can hide the drive to all users, except mine?
