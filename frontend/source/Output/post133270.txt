Will OS upgrade from Snow Leopard to Mavericks erase other partitions? <body> I have Macbook6,1 Late 2009 Unibody white Snow Leopard with dual boot Debian Wheezy installed on the other partition.  I use EFI to show boot options at startup.   Will upgrading to Mavericks overwrite/delete other partitions?  Debian is what I use primarily. I would however like to upgrade to Mavericks for security reasons.  <answer133282> Updating will not affect any partitions you do not choose in the set-up process. If you're not asked, then it will install on the partition the OS X install originated on.  <answer133291> Normally there should not be a problem, if!  As always before doing the OS upgrade it is recommended to do a back up- just in case.  There are, however, a couple situations in which you might consider a clean install.   The first is if you’ve done some funky partitioning of your Mac’s startup drive that prevents the Mavericks installer from creating the special Recovery HD partition.  subThe installer creates an invisible, bootable, 650MB partition—a portion of a drive the operating system treats as a separate volume./sub  Mavericks will also "updates" the EFI partition.  To see all your current set up (including hidden partitions) use the   codediskutil list/code in Terminal  <comment159164> Thanks guys for your responses! From your responses I feel hopeful about this ...I will let you know how this goes <comment159429> You can't directly upgrade from Snow Leopard (10.6.x) to Mavericks. You need to take a mid step of either Lion or Mountain Lion.
