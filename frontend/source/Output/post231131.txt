Getting the First Cell NOT Containing Certain Text in Numbers <body> I have a table in Numbers, and I'm trying to get the value of the first cell that contains the character codeâ€¦/code. In order to do so, I wanted to use codeMATCH()/code, but had no luck after I realized it could only traverse 2 dimensions. Instead, I've set up a table on another sheet that looks like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SYwZC.png" alt="Table with which rows contain the character"  The numbers at the far left are the row numbers of the rows in the table with the actual data. codeRow Contains Cell/code is exactly what it sounds like: whether or not that row contains the desired cell. To figure that out, I used codeMATCH()/code per row.  What I need to figure out now is how to find which row is not the wrong row. It would be easy to look for a cell that says codenot/code, but I need to find a cell with a variable value that is not equal to codenot/code. I want to find the row name (or value of the cell to the left, in column codeA/code) for that cell (in this case, code2/code) and the value of the cell itself in column codeB/code.  What would be the formula for codeCorrect Row/code and codeCorrect Column/code, given what I'm looking for?  I know people have already done this for Excel, but I can't figure it out for Numbers.  I'm open to solutions that require Applescript.  <answer231348> As it turns out, I've figured it out. It did require Applescript. What I did was loop through the rows and selected the values in the row where code"not"/code was not present in column codeB/code. Here's the Applescript I used via Automator:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell application "Numbers"         tell table "Calculator 1" of sheet 2 of document of front window             set aRange to "A2:A22"             set bRange to "B2:B22"             set aRows to the rows of range aRange             set bRows to the rows of range bRange              set correctRow to -1             set correctCol to -1              repeat with i from 1 to count of bRows                 set aCell to "A" &amp; (i + 1)                 set bCell to "B" &amp; (i + 1)                  if value of (cell bCell) is not "not" then                     set correctRow to value of (cell aCell)                     set correctCol to value of (cell bCell)                 end if             end repeat              set the value of (cell "C2") to correctRow             set the value of (cell "C4") to correctCol         end tell          display dialog "Updated!"     end tell      return input end run /code/pre  Keep in mind that the cells I used are specific to my spreadsheet, but generally this method could be applied for any 2D codeMATCH()/code function.  ol liCreate a table has the name of the each row in each row of the header column, and use the desired codeMATCH()/code function per row in this way (see the picture of the table in my question)./li liUse this Applescript to loop through the codeMATCH()/code functions and find the correct row and column.
