How to access history of podcasts I have listened to in iphone? <body> I don't know if this is possible or not: I would like to see the history of all the podcasts I have ever listened to. Is this possible?  <answer135506> I am sure the phone logs this information. I have been wondering the same for as long as the Podcasts app came out in the App Store.   Unfortunately I have failed to find a way to extract data around the play history of my podcasts. I think this is impossible at this time.
