Mac keyboard shortcut for Alt+4 now resolving to ¢ <body> I am not sure how to google for this problem.  I recently upgrade OS:X and had a crash and I lost the ability to do my kbdalt/kbdkbd4/kbd shortcut to move spaces. I instead get the kbd¢/kbd character.  My shortcut setting is set in preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XW8Gu.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am not sure where to override the (new) keyboard shortcut for the kbd¢/kbd key. The other shortcuts for spaces work (ie switching to desktop 1-3).  This was working prior to a system crash.  I have re-added my keyboard that I am using, which does not fix the problem. I have the same problem on my built-in keyboard as well as my USB keyboard.  <answer236514> I used Karabiner and added a custom shortcut:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Override alt4&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.always_send_four&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::4, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, KeyCode::4, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_R&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  I then bound my actual spaces shortcut to kbdControl/kbdkbd4/kbd.  <comment289438> Do you have a keyboard with a 10-key pad? Shortcuts differentiate between 10-key & the numbers above qwerty. Either test using alt/4 on the 10-key, or just remove the shortcut & re-add it using the 4 above qwerty. <comment289439> @Tetsujin I do not have a 10-key pad on either. <comment289440> OS X normally uses alt for special characters.  So on a US keyboard alt 12345 are ¡™£¢∞.  Shortcuts would normally use Control, with Control 1 (^1) the default for Switch to Desktop 1.   That's not good for you? <comment289441> @TomGewecke sure, but that doesn't explain why this was working fine prior to a system crash and now is not working (?).
