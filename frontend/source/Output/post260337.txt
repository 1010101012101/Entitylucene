MacBook Pro not conecting to wifi via password but will connect to same router via BTWifi-with-FON <body> I have a MacBook Pro (2013) and running 10.9.5 I cannot connect via the password to my router but it will allow me to connect to the BTWifi-with-FON which I think is via the same router. It had been working fine until now.   I can connect to any other wifi, including my own router via FON. All other devices work as usual on the router. It is just my own password-protected account. Password has not changed.  <comment325911> Did the password change?  Can you connect to other WiFi networks like somewhere where free WiFi is offered? <comment330118> Thanks for responding, and apology for untimely response from me.
