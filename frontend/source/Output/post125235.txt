Can't log in until after reboot <body> I have an iMac running OS X Mavericks and OS X Server. The OS X Server services running are Time Machine and Xcode.  A couple of times per week, the iMac gets into a state where I cannot log in. I can select my user account on the login screen, and I can enter my password, but the password field just shakes as if I have entered the wrong password. This happens for each of the three user accounts on the machine.  After rebooting, we can log in for a while (a day or two), and then the can't-login state recurs.  I don't know whether this is related, but sometimes this same iMac gets into a state where everything is really slow. Activity Monitor shows that CPU usage is low, memory pressure is low, disk is not full, but everything seems to be running at 5% normal speed. It's fine after a reboot.  When the iMac is in one of those bad states, I can still ssh to it from another Mac, and I can "sudo shutdown -r now" to restart it.  Any ideas about what is going wrong, or how to diagnose the problem?  h2Update:/h2  After uninstalling an old version of VirtualBox about a week ago, the problem hasn't recurred.  Maybe its kexts were causing problems?  <answer141758> From your symptoms and the lack of any other any evidence within your log files, the origin of your problem is a keyboard mode switch. This keyboard mode switch will only make your password wrongly typed through the login window and not through an codessh/code access. This remapping of your keyboard might have been caused by kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdspace/kbd (select previous input source) or kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdalt ⌥/kbd+kbdspace/kbd (select next input source). The 1st one of these 2 key combinations may be easily entered by typing the spacebar on one of its left or right borders, thus pressing the kbdcommand ⌘/kbd at the same time. This shortcut is defined in:  precodeSystem Preferences &gt; Language &amp; Text &gt; Input Sources /code/pre  This keyboard remapping might also have been done by any other keyboard shortcut defined by codeXcode/code or another application.  To avoid to be trapped by such an invisible keyboard remapping or misbehaviour, here are 2 personnal trick.  ol liWithin codeSystem Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Login Options/code, for codeDisplay login windows as:/code select codeName and password/code. Hence you will have a possibility to diagnose any wrong mapping or any other misbehaviour of your keyboard within the field codeName:/code. You might try your password there and have a total feedback./li liWithin codeSystem Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Login Options/code, activate the function codeShow Input menu in login window/code. This 2nd trick won't help you diagnose a dead key./li /ol  <comment146551> Are you logging in to a network user? <comment146553> No, logging in as local user. <comment146571> What does the log shows? <comment146644> I don't see anything in the log that seems relevant. <comment165041> → Kristopher: your Update is a correct answer. Both a technic to analyse a problem through elimination and a solution. Next time you'd like to clearly diagnose such a problem, I advise you to `ssh` on the ill Mac and use `kextstat` & `kextunload`.
