GarageBand multiple takes doesn't work <body> I'm trying to simply record multiple takes using GarageBand 11.  I enable cycling, record once, the hit stop, rewind, record again... BUT NO TRIANGLE APPEARS on the track folder. Also, while the track plays back a 2nd time, its playing out loud so I cannot hear what I'm doing.  I tried with the REPLACE mode enabled and disabled, but that doesn't help.  Any ideas on how I can record multiple tracks?  I have logix 10 installed too and have the same problem there.  <answer124319> You shouldn't (need to) stop and rewind. On the yellow bar on top of the screen, set the region you would like to cycle. Garageband will do the rest.  With pictures:  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH1913?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  <answer274054> Do you want to record multiple tracks, or multiple takes?  For multiple strongtakes/strong you need two things  ol liMake sure Cycle mode is on/li liIn General settings (GarageBand/Preferences/General) emCycle on/em is set to emCreate Takes/em/li /ol  To record multiple strongtracks/strong simultaneously:  ol liMake sure that the Record Enable button is shown img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sREXC.png" alt="Show Record Enable"/li liActivate recording for multiple tracks. You can only do that for separate input channels. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RPjXG.png" alt="Multi track recording"/li /ol
