Force Splotlight to search a subfolder <body> Background:  I moved the codeMicrosoft User Data/code from code~/Documents/code to code~/Library/Preferences/code because I didn't want Google Drive to sync my Office files. I can run Office products fine, but I can't search my mail because Spotlight can't search my code.olk14Message/code files (under code~/Library/Preferences/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/hobbes3/Data Records/Messages//code).  Here is the weird part:  If I'm in code~/Library/Preferences/code then I can use Spotlight to search for all my mail code.olk14Message/code, but if I'm one folder up in code~/Library/code or higher then I can't search for my mail... And of course I can't search for my mail from Spotlight globally (which breaks my Outlook 2011 searching).  Mail searches show up in code~/Library/Preferences/code img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTk2f.jpg" alt="enter image description here" But not in code~/Library/code??? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z97qG.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried the following and it didn't work:  ul liSymlinking codeMicrosoft User Data/code from code~/Documents/code to code~/Library/Preferences/code/li liRe-indexing my entire drive with codesudo mdutil -E //code/li liAdding and removing the codeMicrosoft User Data/code to the Privacy tab in Spotlight in System Preferences/li /ul  Interesting results:  precodehobbes3@hobbes3-splunk ~ % mdimport ~/Library 2014-12-22 14:56:32.121 mdimport[2106:22241] Error loading /Library/Spotlight/Microsoft Office.mdimporter/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Office:  dlopen(/Library/Spotlight/Microsoft Office.mdimporter/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Office, 262): no suitable image found.

(Exception: Yosemite considers /System/Library/CoreServices to be an applications folder and not a system files folder.) By default, it won't find such files unless you start inside the Library folder or add "System files" "are included" to the search terms. (If you don't see "System files" as an option, select "Other". Scroll through the list to find "System files", or instead of scrolling start typing "System files" in the search field. Optionally, turn on the check mark to add "System files" to the menu so you won't have to look for it again.)  Anything whose name starts with a period (like .olk14Message in your case) is considered invisible. Spotlight won't find anything that's invisible or in an invisible folder unless you either start in the invisible folder or add a search term for "File visibility" that says to report invisible items.  codemdimport/code won't help here. Spotlight has already indexed even System files and Invisible files. It just won't show them to you unless you specifically ask for them.  For codemdutil -E .../code, you need to specify a volume, not a folder. Thus, for example, codemdutil -E //code would erase (and probably rebuild) the Spotlight index for your entire boot volume. You can't select anything smaller than a volume.
