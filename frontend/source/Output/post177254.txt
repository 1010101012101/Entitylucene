How to fix Samsung printer JobAccounting2 module printing crashes? <body> There are 2 brand new iMac running Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Both machines have a wired ethernet connection to a wired Samsung CLX-6260ND MFC (multifunction) printer.  Installation is a piece of cake, go to system preferences, printers and scanners, add a new printer, and the printer is already there in the Bonjour list. Now the OS downloads additional software and ready to print.  Then the issues start occurring, before even creating a print preview the applications crashes.  hr  h2Word JobAccounting2 printing error/h2  precodeMicrosoft Error Reporting log version: 2.0  Error Signature: Exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESS Date/Time: 2015-03-18 10:45:27 +0000 Application Name: Microsoft Word Application Bundle ID: com.microsoft.Word Application Signature: MSWD Application Version: 14.4.8.150116 Crashed Module Name: JobAccounting2 Crashed Module Version: 2.14 Crashed Module Offset: 0x00005b06 Blame Module Name: JobAccounting2 Blame Module Version: 2.14 Blame Module Offset: 0x00005b06 ... /code/pre  hr  h2Safari JobAccounting2 printing error/h2  precodePlugIn Path:       /Library/Printers/Samsung/PDEs/JobAccounting2.bundle/Contents/MacOS/JobAccounting2 PlugIn Identifier: com.samsung.driver.print.pde.JobAccounting2 PlugIn Version:    2.14 (2.14)  Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x00000000000000a8 /code/pre  hr  The faulty JobAccounting2 module is:  precode$ ls -l /Library/Printers/Samsung/PDEs/JobAccounting2.bundle/Contents/MacOS/JobAccounting2 -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  194320 Oct 31  2013 /Library/Printers/Samsung/PDEs/JobAccounting2.bundle/Contents/MacOS/JobAccounting2 /code/pre  The fault printer driver version number according to: System Preferences  Printers and scanners  Printing  Samsung CLX 6260 Series  Open print queue  Settings  General: 1.11.01  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qdsrI.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Printers and scanners &gt; Printing &gt; Samsung CLX 6260 Series &gt; Open print queue &gt; Settings &gt; General: Driver version: 1.11.01"  Regression:  ul liWord, Excel, Outlook, Safari, Firefox, they all crash./li liHave installed OS updates, still printing crashes./li liWe installed the most recent (09.03.2015 also known as 5.00.0a04) printer driver from Samsung website, and still crashes all over.

For the already installed printers the driver won't be updated when installing the updated driver.  The trick is to remove all Samsung printers affected from System Preferences  Printing and scanning  Printing. And then adding those printers again.  Then the Samsung driver version updates, in this case from 1.11.01 to 5.00:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PrVLt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment209596> Ouch - we're back to Samsung's wonderful Mac support :( I've always found the built-in Apple/Samsung drivers work better than Samsung's own - but they don't necessarily have all the modules. <comment209606> @Tetsujin In this case there were only drivers installed that were offered by the operating system. In managed to fix this by removing the old Mac OS X Samsung drivers and installing printer drivers as downloaded from Samsung on the 10.9 Mac. I am going to write an answer soon. <comment374209> I have set the printer as "default" and it doesn't crash!!
