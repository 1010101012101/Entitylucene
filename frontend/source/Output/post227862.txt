Is a website block not visible on Safari on MacBook Pro? <body> A client of mine claims he cannot see the social icons (on the left side of the screen) when viewing the website on Macbook Pro with Safari. Those icons are perfectly visible on all devices I've tested it with.  Are there any Macbook Pro users that can confirm the bug? The website URL is as follows:  https://www.mydaypix.com  <answer227867> I'd get him to check AdBlock…br Safari prefs  Extensions  AdBlock 'Click me to show AdBlock's options…  strongOther Filter lists/strongbr ☐ Antisocial filter list (removes social media buttons)  <comment277738> Not a site for opinions, but I will test it. – A good site for opinions is the Reddit for Macbooks  https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/ <comment277739> Tested, I can see the buttons, however clicking results in nothing happening. <comment277740> @Mru Thanks mate! I need nothing more ;-) <comment277743> That's a good point! I will have to ask him. <comment277768> You were absolutely right! I would never think about that!
