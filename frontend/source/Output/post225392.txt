I can't get my DJ Software program to load properly <body> I'm using a software called strongrekordbox v4.0.5/strong for my iMac, 2.7 Core i5.  The program's start up screen pops up and then never displays anything after that.    Is there anyway for my to track the program from when it starts up to see what the issues are?  I've tried all the suggestions the website recommended for issues related to this but none have come to fruition.  Any help or pointing in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.
