Windows on Parallels 10 with 2 out of 3 monitors only <body> I've MacBook Pro with 2 external monitors connected. Is there a way to configure Parallels so that it allows you to use 2 monitors for Windows and the main one for Mac? I only found option to make it all or just 1. Also I don't want to expand Windows across the 2 monitors (i guess there's an option to do that). I want them treated as separate spaces so i can easily move things around between 2 monitors (for example Outlook on one, chrome on the other).   <answer147598> Actually, after thinking about it for a bit I decided to go with coherence mode which seems to do this in a bit different way then I wanted it (no desktops etc) but it may serve it's purpose of being able to mix MAC/Windows enough to move windows around easily.   <answer161549> Using UltraMon seems to work fine for me, I've found it in a post on the Parallels Forum:     I will start the VM with 3 screens, then I use a 3rd party software (UltraMon) and disable the one display so that my VM uses two screens running Windows 7 and my MacOS uses the one.   <comment173990> Yes, it works, but feeling a bit weird. Maybe i'll work it out and just need to get used to it. <comment188796> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment188809> @patrix the solution is simple (Use Ultramon). He also gave a description. I believe it's legit answer. Short one but it has a point. <comment241097> Haha, patrix was actually the one who edited my answer to provide the helpful blurb :) @MadBoy
