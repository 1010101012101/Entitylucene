Window UI Texture Artifacts <body> I just install OSX Lion on an old Mac Pro, as well as all the major updates 10.7.1 through to 10.7.5.  Then I installed the BASH Shellshock patch for OSX Lion 10.7.5 and after restarting my Window UI now has a bunch of graphics artefacts (see screenshot).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MItdy.png" alt="Window UI Artifacts"  Any ideas on how to fix this issue, or what is causing it?  Thanks in advance
