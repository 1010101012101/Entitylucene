Rename all images in library from project name <body> I'd like to rename emall/em images in my Aperture library based on their project name plus an index, e.g. for a project named "South Africa" the file names should be "South Africa 1", "South Africa 2", etc. (order determined by date).  Of course, for a single project I could easily do this with "Batch change" but I'd like to apply this to all projects in my library. Can this be done using AppleScript?  <comment355788> Aperture does have an AppleScript Dictionary and you can open it in Script Editor (from File  Open Dictionary...) and see what's available to work with.
