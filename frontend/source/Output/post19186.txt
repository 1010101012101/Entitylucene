How to turn off animation while navigating browser's history <body> Is there is any way to turn off animation while navigating through pages in safari (using one finger  swipe left/right gesture)?  I know, that it is a subtle different thing comparing to what we've accustomed to call navigation, since clicking back/forward history buttons works as expected.   But as for me, it is really annoying, eye straining and time consuming - to see animation each time you use mouse gestures to navigate.   <answer19187> You could simply disable scroll-to-navigate in the mouse/trackpad preferences, and instead use the two-finger swipe (or three, on a trackpad).  img src="https://cl.ly/1S2x320X3L1N2K3R1I18/content" alt=""  <comment21009> oh, that's great! <comment21011> @shabunc: Note the third option gives you the best of both worlds: you can use the pretty animations when you want them, and not when you don't (or in apps that don't support it).
