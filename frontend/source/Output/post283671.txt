Change Permissions on macOS USB Device <body> I need to find out how to set the permissions of a USB flash drive at the device (not filesystem) level.  In other words, I need to grant the emuser/em read/write access to a USB device identified by codediskutil/code which is code/dev/diskX/code where X is some integer.  For example, I insert a USB flash drive and according to codediskutil/code it's identifier is code/dev/disk5/code.  If I check the permissions of it:  precode$ ls /dev/disk5* brw-r-----  1 root  operator    1,  15 May 15 08:35 /dev/disk5 brw-r-----  1 root  operator    1,  16 May 15 08:35 /dev/disk5s1 brw-r-----  1 root  operator    1,  17 May 15 08:35 /dev/disk5s2 /code/pre  It has coderoot:operator/code ownership and coderw/code access limited to root and coder/code access to codeoperators/code only (this is why you must issue commands that modify the device as codesudo/code).  What I need to do is give coderw/code access to the operator as well and it's not as simple as just codechmod 660 /dev/disk5/code.  The moment you unplug the device and plug it back in, it loses the permissions.  Why do I need to do this?  I need to boot a USB flash drive in VirtualBox.  To do so, I need to be able to create a "raw" disk image as a passthrough to the actual USB device.  The problem is, to do this, I must issue the command via codesudo/code which then changes the user I am executing codeVBoxManage/code which causes a number of errors since coderoot/code has an environment completely different than the logged in user.  This can be accomplished in FreeBSD (I am sure Linux as well via a different method) by modifying the codedevfs.rules/code file and adding in a line like:  precodeadd path 'da*' mode 0660 group operator /code/pre  Which essentially gives coderw/code access to any USB storage device (USB storage is identified by FreeBSD as code/dev/da0/code, code/dev/da1/code, etc.)  How do I do this on macOS?  <comment357891> You would have to make a persistent autofs mapping I suspect. macOS might store them in the local directory (as in LDAP).
