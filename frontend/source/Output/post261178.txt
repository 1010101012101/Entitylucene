Locating Name Manager in Excel for Mac <body> With named ranges it is more convenient to operate formulas. For instance, instead of typing code=SUM(C20:C30)/code you can enter code=SUM(FirstQuarterSales)/code  Where is Name Manager located in Excel 2016? I don't see any button in the Formulas Ribbon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2yfIN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer261179> There is no special button for the Name Manager in any version of Excel for Mac. However, you can call it by pressing kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdfn/kbd + kbdF3/kbd.  The dialog window will appear, where you can enter name for a data range and a range of cells: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zFFd0.png" alt="enter image description here"  Another way is to click InsertNameDefine and modify,add,or delete data ranges names.  <comment339384> Just a comment from the experience. Please, be aware that there is probably a bug and Excel may accidentally and randomly change named ranges! Check and if you have same bad experience, just don't use them.
