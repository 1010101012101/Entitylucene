AppleScript URL from open safari window <body> I have a Safari window displaying a webpage. I want to be able to retrieve the open URL into AppleScript. However when I do this:  precodeif URL of window 1 is "www.google.com" then     --do something end if /code/pre  It returns an error of nothing being returned. And I'm pretty sure window 1 exists because in another part of the program I created the window.  strongCan someone tell me the mistake I made?/strong  <answer239429> strongURL/strong is a property of a document or a property of a tab in a window, so use this:  precodeif URL of document 1 is "www.google.com" then /code/pre  or this:  precodeif URL of current tab of window 1 is "www.google.com" then /code/pre  hr  strongUpdate/strong, example of how to use the codeexists/code command:  precodetell application "Safari"     set b to exists URL of document 1 -- this put false or true into the variable     if b and URL of document 1 is "www.google.com" then         -- do something     end if end tell /code/pre  <comment293848> I was literally getting ready to post an answer when the message came up that an answer has been posted. Since your's was better written then mine I decided not to post it and instead just +1 yours! :) <comment293850> This question shows absolutely no research and IMO does not deserve an up-vote since a Google search for [applescript get url safari](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=applescript+get+url+safari&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) would have provided an answer! <comment293907> @user3439894 I got confused with the search. I'm very new to AppleScript. <comment293946> error "No result was returned from some part of this expression." number -2763 <comment294001> You get this error because it's a blank page or the page is not loaded, so use a `try` block, or the `exists` command <comment294135> I solved it a different way. Yea it was because the page wasn't fully loaded. And I had to set a string property to the URL before comparing in the If loop. I used try and end try.
