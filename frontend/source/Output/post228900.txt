How to open the Preview window maximised by default? <body> Does anyone know how to open Preview.app with the window maximised by default, in order to automatically fit the screen?  Right now, the Preview window opens almost half screen and I think it is quire annoying to enlarge it manually. Thanks.  <answer230351> Only option is to use the key combination option (alt) + space to fullscreen the document.  **update: If you do alt+space you will go fullscreen, hold the alt button and you zoom 100% of the file   <comment281157> But this is **Quicklook**  not **Preview**. <comment281165> Your right, but quicklook is faster and easier.
