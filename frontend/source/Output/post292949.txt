Missing Simulator Devices in Xcode <body> When programming with Xcode (8.3.3), the "View as" feature displays the   user interface on many simulated Apple devices. Yesterday, I could choose among the following devices.  ul liAppleTV/li liiPad (5th generation)/li liiPad Air/li liiPad Air 2/li liiPad Pro (9.7 inch)/li liiPad Pro (10.5 inch)/li liiPad Pro (12.9 inch)/li liiPad Pro (12.9 inch) (2nd generation)/li liiPhone 5/li liiPhone 5s/li liiPhone 6/li liiPhone 6 Plus/li liiPhone 7/li liiPhone 7 Plus/li liiPhone SE/li /ul  Today, these devices are still listed in the Scheme Editor next to the "Play and "Stop" buttons (build and run, stop icons), as shown below.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBIxF.png" alt="Xcode Available Devices"  However, today, I have only a subset of the devices to use with the "View as" feature, as listed and illustrated below.  ul liiPad Pro (12.9 inch)/li liiPad Pro (10.5 inch)/li liiPad Pro (9.7 inch)/li liiPhone 7 Plus/li liiPhone 7/li liiPhone SE/li liiPhone 4s/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a9RUW.png" alt="Xcode Available Devices Subset"  I hope the question is not off topic, because it isn't really about programming but program usage. What have I done, and how can I fix it?  <answer292951> Bluntly put: "view as" â‰  simulator.  Those "view as" options are to preview different viewport resolutions with storyboards and are independent from simulator selection. As the resolutions are common with multiple devices (ie. iPhone 6 = 6s = 7) it is unnecessary to list them all. You could think of it as a visual preview.  The device list next to Play/Stop is the actual simulator selector list and choosing one will fire up an actual simulator when running.  <comment369602> Sorry, that was a Red Herring statement from me. (I was trying to quell any answers suggesting that I should choose a simulator in the scheme editor.) All of the devices listed were available to me yesterday as a "View as" option. <comment369626> It was a combination of automatic updates and undocumented changes in Xcode 8.3.3.
