Dockmode apps for ipod touch <body> I have a ipod touch which is mostly docked and I seldom use it. I want to make a good use of it, for example.  ul liAn app which displays daily news./li liAn app that displays tweets./li liAn app that could display quotes./li liAn app that could display a slideshow of photos./li /ul  None of these should require any human interaction and it should be completely passive. Is there any app that comes to your mind that has similar characteristics?  It is sort of like daydream feature of android 4.2+  <comment190695> what did you find so far ? <comment190705> Which generation of iPod touch are you using, and what version of iOS is on it? Regardless of that, though, the things you describe are not possible without "any human interaction" unless the device is unlocked and the app has been launched. iOS cannot display things like that while locked. <comment190712> If you can't find anything, you should get [Pythonista](https://appsto.re/us/P0xGF.i)
