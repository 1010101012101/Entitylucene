Where did my iCloud capacity go? <body> The photo shows my odd state of affairs. Apple has started to pester me to buy additional iCloud capacity even though, per their own numbers, I should have no need. The "Manage Storage" page seems to say both that I'm using only 2.1 Gb and that I'm using 4.7 Gb. Based on the latter number, my devices have stopped backing up.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oVVio.jpg" alt="I&#39;m using 2.1 Gb but iOS says My 5Gb is almost entirely used up. What gives?"  <comment249012> I'm having this issue too, it seems like there's items in iCloud that aren't being displayed, but taking up space. Have you contacted apple about this? <comment249028> Are photos counted elsewhere? [I don't use cloud storage for photos, so it's just a wild guess] <comment249029> @Tetsujin I don't use iCloud for photos; I use it for very little. <comment249030> OK, was just a thought. <comment249271> @IronCraftMan I have a Genius Bar appointment for Thursday. I will post here if anything interesting comes of it.
