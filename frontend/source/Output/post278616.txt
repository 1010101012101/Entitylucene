external monitor no longer working, but no hardware failures <body> I'm using Sierra 10.12.5 Beta (16F43c) on a iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015).  I wish to use an external Dell monitor 1600x1200px, dvi.  I have two cables that I know are working fine and so does the monitor, (I can test with other devices)  the problem is that since a few days I can no longer use the monitor, it's not recognised and it goes immediately on "Entering Power Save Mode".   I tried to unplug everything, reset PRAM but it did not help at all, it really looks like a software bug on Sierra end. what can I do?  <comment350648> Have you reset the NVRAM as well? If not, try that. If that doesn't work, try reverting to 10.12.4 (stable) and see if it goes back to working. <comment350651> seems like NVRAM is old PRAM <comment350655> Oops! I meant SMC <comment350656> alright, let's try this bad boy here <comment350657> nope, didn't work. <comment350663> great, now it doesn't work with the macbook pro as well... I'm sure the cable and the monitor are ok though. <comment350704> Does your MBP also have macOS Sierra installed? If so, is it also the Sierra 10.12.5 Beta? If not, then you've really limited it down to an issue with the cable and/or monitor. You could try restarting both the iMac and MBP in Safe Mode and see what happens (both during Safe Mode and again later when booted normally). <comment350726> MBP is 10.12.4 I'll try what you suggest later. <comment352660> seems like the problem is sierra, I've read this on the the apple forum "Sierra no longer supports non-generic display adapter (HDMI, DVI, VGA. ect)" https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7683876?start=45&tstart=0
