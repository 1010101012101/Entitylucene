Change the selection to 'Web Safe Colors'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eMYu1.png" alt="enter image description here"  This will give you:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wdlih.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Update :  I made a quick app so I could create a custom HEX picker palette using the colours found at http://www.w3schools.com's html_colornames  hr  UPDATE: I found a list at :  http://www.colourlovers.com ultimate-html-color-hex-code-list I Combined the two lists : The process I use automaticlly removes repeats. The Palette now holds about 1520 HEX Colors.  hr  You can down load the .clr file here.  Place the file inside of you home strongColors/strong folder: code~/Library/Colors//code  Some apps may need to be relaunched before their colour picker picks it up. The New Picker can be found in the Palettes drop down menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WvRJu.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C128n.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I get time I will also put on my blog the App. But I would need to change it a bit so it can be used to add any set of HEX codes. Or if any one knows where the is the ultimate HEX code list. I will try and convert that.   <comment137901> Can I type a HEX code into this?

Unfortunately, it does not work for me. For some reason the hex picker returns wrong hex values. E.g. a full red image (#ff000000) created in photoshop, is evaluated as #f70016.
