video player that remembers where you left? <body> Is there a video player that remembers where you left on each video?br Pretty much like listening to podcasts in iTunes, but with videos.  <answer45116> Take a look at MPlayerX. I love it. Not only does it remember video location, but also has seamless fast-forward to the next episode of a season.  <comment51346> If anyone knows some way to keep the playback position with VLC, please answer [Can VLC remember movie position? - Super User](http://superuser.com/q/226397/69039) as well. <comment51424> Wow that's a good feature.
