Did you used to be able to hardware upgrade your own Mac Pro? <body> A recent blog post about Apple's technology curve (Apple's 2016 in Review) had this statement:     ...with this version of the Mac Pro, Apple took what was a solid   developer machine and turned it into an appliance, one users couldnâ€™t   upgrade components on their own.   The author seems to be implying that current Mac Pros cannot be modified or upgraded, but in previous years or in older models that was possible. What is the change that occurred here?  <answer267437> h1A Mac Pro is not a MacBook/h1  strongOld Mac Pro [5,1]/strongbr  with the side removed, which is the only way to really tell the old ones apart in a picture    Components upgradable    ol liby an average user  ul liRAM  /li liGraphics Card  /li liDrives - DVD/HD/SSD [maximum 6 standard size drives, more with SATA SSD or PCI SSD]/li lihardware RAID card  /li /ul/li liby a pro/enthusiast  ul liCPUs  /li liBluetooth/WiFI card/li /ul/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RUc3l.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongNew Mac Pro [6,1]/strong  Components upgradable    ol liby an average user  ul liRAM  /li /ul/li liby a pro/enthusiast  ul liCPU/li /ul/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwSxG.png" alt="enter image description here"  See Apple KB: How to identify Mac Pro models  <comment335562> We can't know what the author was referring to, probably best to ask him directly. <comment335569> @patrix Given that the question has already received a more or less correct and objective answer, your allegation that it is opinion-based is, I think, extremely premature. The existing answer identifies the models and identifies which items are upgradable by the average user. That is NOT an opinion. <comment335571> I've changed your question slightly to remove the part which asked for an opinion.
