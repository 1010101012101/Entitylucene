How do I mount a sparsebundle to a folder rather than an image? <body> I have a encrypted sparsebundle and I want to mount to to a folder in my home directory and not under /Volumes. How can I do that?  <answer23523> The codehdiutil/code command-line utility gives you more flexibility, and is extensively documented in codeman hdiutil/code. Something like this should do:  precodehdiutil attach -mountpoint ~/myMountPoint mySparsebundle.dmg /code/pre  <answer56198> precodehdiutil attach /Volumes/ATimeMachine/Pictures/iPhoto\ Library.sparsebundle -mountpoint ~/iPho /code/pre  If this command is successful you should see something like:  precode/dev/disk3              Apple_partition_scheme           /dev/disk3s1            Apple_partition_map              /dev/disk3s2            Apple_Driver43                   /dev/disk3s3            Apple_Driver43                   /dev/disk3s4            Apple_Driver_ATA                 /dev/disk3s5            Apple_Driver_ATA                 /dev/disk3s6            Apple_FWDriver                   /dev/disk3s7            Apple_Driver_IOKit               /dev/disk3s8            Apple_Patches                    /dev/disk3s9            Apple_HFS                       /Users/me/iPho /code/pre  where codeiPhoto Library.sparsebundle/code is on a DroboFS (NAS) and is a 500G "hard disk" image formatted MacOS HFS journaled  Running the codehdiutil/code command mounts the image under my home directory. I tired to mount it on top of the original iPhoto Library, but the original was still visible in there after mounting, so I changed the name of the mount point to codeiPho/code instead. Then I decided it didn't really matter where the mount point was, it would be fine under code/Volumes/code as long as codeiPhoto.app/code knows where it is.  Option click codeiPhoto.app/code to launch it with a prompt to create a new library, and I did that in the mounted disk image. Then import all photos (previously managed with Picasa under a code~/Pictures/code directory tree) on my hard drive into iPhoto, which copies them into the mounted image, which resides on the NAS where it has some fault tolerance because of the DroboFS. This also frees up half the space on my small 500G SSD drive in the MacBook Air.  <answer75811> You might also be interested in http://blog.marc-seeger.de/2011/02/06/encrypted-diskimages-in-osx/ which explains step by step how to set up auto-mount to the specified mount point:  ul lirun codemount/code to identify the disk device (code/dev/diskNsN/code usually)/li lirun codediskutil info /dev/diskNsn | grep UUID/code to get the UUID/li liuse codesudo vifs/code to add a line to code/etc/fstab/code  precodeUUID=whatever-you-noted-before /path/to/mountpoint hfs rw 1 0 /code/pre/li liAdd your disk image to your login items to have it automatically mounted on code/path/to/mountpoint/code at the next login/li /ul  <comment87995> can this be made persistent across reboots? <comment88005> @ErikAllik yes - but why not ask a general unstinted how to run a shell script at boot time (before a user logs in) or after a user logs in.
