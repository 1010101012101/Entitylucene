How do I resize the iOS simulator? <body> I know that there's WindowScale100/75/50% but the scale of the retina iPad simulator is still too big for my screen to be able to test anything.  Is there a way I can scale the size of the iOS simulator smaller than one of the default values? I need it to scale down at least to 25% for my screen size to accommodate the window.  <answer63004> You can't. I've been an iOS software developer for two years and I haven't been able to find a way do this. I have tried to find solutions to this but came up with nothing. I'd love to be proven wrong, but I'm 99% certain there's no way to do this.  When my screen is too small I use 50% scale window, which is ought to be enough until I hook up my big monitor again at home.  <answer93313> You can scale iOS Simulator to desire scale (I tried from .2 to 1.4 ) and it worked for me.   To do this you have to go to code/Library/Preferences/code and edit codecom.apple.iphonesimulator.plist/code file. Edit value for key codeSimulatorWindowLastScale/code to desire scale.  I tried this on latest version of Mountain Lion (10.8.4) and on the iOS 6.0 Simulator.  <answer181213> In Xcode 6.3 just press kbd⌘/kbd+kbd5/kbd (25% scale) or kbd⌘/kbd+kbd4/kbd (33% scale). Or in Window  Scale  <answer293583> Now It's more flexible with Xcode 9- Simulator. You can pick &amp; drag any corner or simulator to resize it and set it according to your requirement.

I did add the ios-simulator tag as I think it is possible it could be used by others. <comment72825> Confirmed; has to do with a rendering issue if you could resize it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1446135/reduce-the-size-of-the-iphone-simulator-window <comment123782> On my setup, using Xcode 5 from the App Store, the fine is located in the path ~/Library/Preferences. Modified it as explained and it worked fine. For me, .4 was the magic number to make the iPad fit properly on my screen. <comment165046> New update in iOS SDK now allows scaling, see my answer below. <comment165054> @Nicholas OP knew he could scale to 50% or 75% of the size, he was wondering if he can go smaller like 25%. <comment165069> My bad, over read that. Have deleted my answer :) <comment166211> This should be the accepted best answer. <comment170674> I had inconsistent results with the simulator in Xcode 6, but ultimately it does still seem to work. `defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iphonesimulator SimulatorWindowLastScale "0.4"` <comment180527> Works perfectly to get iphone 6 plus to fit on my (only) hd screen <comment189722> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26258345/iphone-6-plus-simulator-scaling It worked for me. Enjoy programming. <comment251518> As of today with Xcode 7, you can now select 25% scale of the simulator. <comment273435> I was looking for how to scale it - Window  Scale does the trick... <comment279940> For Ios 8 and 9 you can also use Command + 3 OR Command + 2 for resizing the ios simulator. <comment311251> lefakir on this page, has a great answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1446135/reduce-the-size-of-the-iphone-simulator-window
