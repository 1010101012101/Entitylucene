Apple Pencil issue after iOS 10 update <body> For the first several months I had an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil, the performance of that combo was near-flawless. But ever since I upgraded my iPad Pro (9.7-inch) to iOS 10 a few months ago, I've had a very specific problem that makes it very difficult to use the Pencil. At first I thought it was a OneNote problem, since OneNote has been having many problems under iOS 10. However, the specific problem with the Pencil seems to affect all apps, including Apple's own Notes app.  So here's the problem: when writing or drawing with the Apple Pencil, it occasionally fails to recognize that I have lifted the Pencil from the screen, and adds a perfectly straight line between the end of the last stroke and the beginning of the next stroke. This can happen regardless of how much time has passed between strokes. Sometimes I can write for a while without it happening at all, but other times it will happen 4-5 times in a matter of seconds, which makes writing difficult and drawing impossible.  Has anybody else encountered this and/or a similar problem? Even more importantly, has anybody SOLVED this problem? I tried to Google it, but found nothing.
