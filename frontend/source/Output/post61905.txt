How can I reset a Mac's password from Single User Mode? <body> My sister bought a used MacBook about 6 months ago and she has lost her password.  Here is the procedure I tried to use to reset the password:  ol liBoot into single user mode (press Command-S at power on)/li liType codefsck -fy/code/li liType codemount -uw //code/li liType codelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist/code/li liType codedscl . -passwd /Users/username password/code, replacing username with the targeted user and password with the desired password./li liReboot/li /ol  But when I try the step 4, it says codelaunch_msg(): Socket is not connected/code.  I would like to know what command to enter in the single user mode to know what version the Macbook is running and the right command to reset the password. Thank you.  <answer61909> Once you mount the file system, you should be able to use codepasswd username/code and then put in the password twice.   <answer61932> Try loading codecom.apple.opendirectoryd.plist/code instead.  ol liHold command-S on startup./li liRun codemount -uw //code. (codefsck -fy/code is not necessary.)/li liIn 10.7 and later, run:  precode launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist /code/pre  or in 10.6 and earlier:  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist /code/pre/li liRun codepasswd username/code and reset the password./li liRun codereboot/code./li /ol  A second way to reset the login password of an account is to use Reset Password.app from the recovery partition:  ol liHold command-R on startup./li liOpen Terminal from the Utilities menu./li liRun coderesetpassword/code, which opens the Reset Password application./li liSelect the volume and account and reset the password./li /ol  A third way is to create a new admin account:  ol liHold command-S on startup./li liRun codemount -uw //code./li liRun coderm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code./li liRun codereboot/code./li liGo through the steps of creating a new account./li liReset the password of the old account from the Users &amp; Groups preference pane./li /ol  None of these options resets the password of the login keychain.  If FileVault 2 is enabled, you have to enter a password to start up in single user mode, and you can't use Reset Password.app to reset the password of an account.  <answer112369> Hold kbdâŒ˜-S/kbd on startup, then type  precode/sbin/fsck -y /sbin/mount -uw / sh /etc/rc  passwd [username of account you want to change here] /code/pre  It should ask you to enter the new password twice.  precodereboot /code/pre  <answer122826> I kept getting the codelaunch_msg(): Socket is not connected/code message, so I used cd to get to the LaunchDaemons directory and typed in  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codelaunchctl load com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist  passwd username /code/pre  This worked.  Not sure why it didn't like the directory path as it had no errors.  <comment71488> You recommand those steps : 1. Type `fsck -fy` 2. Type `mount -uw /` 3. Type `passwd username` Is there a way to know the user name ? I'm not sure if I should enter the space from the main screen name... <comment71489> If I remember right I tried that also yesterday and the system was asking me to enter `launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist` first :( <comment71490> You can do an ls /Users/ and view the users list there. <comment71497> Thanks a lot ! I was typing Is* instead of ls. (*Capital i) <comment71499> It's an l so it'd be LS if in all caps <comment71505> Thanks for the specification, I will try this at home tonight I hope it works, my sister has a lot of work on this laptop ! I will come back here on monday and give you your reward :) <comment112758> In your forth step "dscl . passwd /Users/username" is the "passed" the new password? And is the "username" the username found in command "ls /User"? <comment117116> Alas none of this worked in my situation. I just keep getting 'launch_msg(): Socket is not connected'. <comment122428> Any reason that `com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist` would not exist? <comment143363> [This answer has already been given.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/61932/37797) <comment143365> The answer was not given because everybody was trying to type in launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist.  This did not work as I had to go to the LaunchDaemons directory. <comment246408> Command-R method FTW -- thank you! <comment262197> This worked for me too, after I did the following:    after you cd into the LaunchDaemons directory at `/System/Library` that you type the command `mount -uw /` in order to make your commands writable <comment283719> Scroll down to see a much better and more thorough answer. <comment327553> `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist` doesn't exist in OSX 10.4 on my Powerbook G4. Just gonna point that out. <comment335887> Perfect, thorough answer. Thanks so much for this. Quick question: can you expand on the consequences of the "login keychain" not being reset with this? Thanks!
