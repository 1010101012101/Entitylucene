Applescript to keep a button pressed until I press it again? <body> I need an extra modifier key which acts kinda like Capslock by using AppleScript - or maybe you've got another proposition?  I would bind it to some key combination in BetterTouchTool.  <answer220414> A quite simple "self-regulating" way to switch between modifier keys strongemWITHOUT being able to read their state/em/strong could be to utilize their innate "effect" on a user's keyboard.br Write two scripts:  precode  [script 1:]  tell application "System Events" to shift key down    [script 2:]  tell application "System Events" to shift key up /code/pre  strongToggling shift/strong: apply a shortcut (e.g.) strong"option o"/strong to the 1st script, strong"option emshift/em o"/strong to the 2nd one.     Now, each time you press strong"option o"/strong when calling the scripts, emthis will strongSTILL toggle/strong "shift"/em as "System Events" will receive strong"option shift o"/strong in case of a strongpreviously active shift key/strong ...      (Another way might be to use a global variable  or even a plist file.)  <comment247092> Between which kind of states of what do you want to toggle? Something like insert mode and normal mode in vi? <comment247096> Yes, exactly something like in vi. <comment266888> Does it have to be with AppleScript? Sticky Keys is essentially for this exact purpose (but for disabled people, not specifically for making other modifiers behave like caps) <comment266890> What _EXACTLY_ do you have in mind? S.th. like a continuously pressed letter ("a" or "b" or whatever), or is it a "shift-lock" / "option-lock"? . . . I would like to know this as I gave the first answer below but may have been mistaken about your actual aim ... <comment270991> What I need is something working like capslock - when I press down on that 'special key' it turns it's state to 1. Then every other key press is registered by system as 'special key + another key' until I press that 'special key' again which turns it's state to 0. <comment317866> Thank you, this works perfectly for me.
