How to manually trigger background image change? <body> I have set the wallpaper to change every hour and have enabled it to cycle them in a random order. Sometimes the background image changes to an image that was set just few rounds ago and I'd like to rechange it to something else.  strongHow to trigger the background change manually?/strong So that next random image in the folder is chosen and the crossfade effect is played.  I'd love to hear a command line solution, and would rather not install third party software (although, if you have something to share, don't let me to hold you back — someone might find it useful).  <answer12128> I have found this MacWorld post showing an AppleScript that you can execute to force that.     I have my desktop images set to change every 30 minutes in random order. Sometimes the desktop will display an image that displayed earlier in the day, and I wanted a way to 'advance' the image easily. The following AppleScript will cause the desktop image to change, in whatever order you have set, each time it is run:   And this is the script:  precodeproperty theSwitch : 0 if theSwitch = 0 then   tell application "System Events"     tell current desktop       set change interval to 1801.0     end tell   end tell   set theSwitch to 1 else   tell application "System Events"     tell current desktop       set change interval to 1800.0     end tell   end tell   set theSwitch to 0 end if /code/pre  Please check the link strongand the comments/strong for more similar or complete alternatives.  strikestrongNote:/strong I have not tested this. /strike  strongUPDATE/strong I'm sorry to hear that it didn't work for you, yet it does for me on Snow Leopard with the following script:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell current desktop         set initInterval to get change interval -- get the currrent display interval         set change interval to -1 -- force a change to happen right now         set change interval to initInterval -- change it back to the original display interval     end tell end tell /code/pre  strongWARNING/strong  This assumes that you have   [X] "change picture ever x timesteps"   [X] Random Order  The above works for me. I ran it from the AppleScript Editor several times to make sure it was working and it indeed does change the Wallpaper.   <answer19938> @Martín's answer works flawlessly in Snow Leopard. However, in Lion, every change of the codechange interval/code results to a background change, ie. the background gets changed two times when the script is run.  Worry not, it is easily fixed: just set the codechange interval/code as whatever it is currently set to:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell current desktop         set initInterval to get change interval         set change interval to initInterval      end tell end tell /code/pre  It is a bit tautological, sure, but it works.  <answer90301> Apoloiges for replying to an old question.  Thanks @koiyu for that code, it's confirmed working in Mountain Lion. However, if you're using multiple monitors, it only works on the first monitor. I slightly modified your code to make it work on all monitors.  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat with thisDesktop in every desktop         tell thisDesktop             set initInterval to get change interval             set change interval to initInterval         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Interestingly, if you are using multiple spaces with Mission Control, it will only change the wallpapers on all monitors of your currently focused space. You can switch to another space and run it again to change the wallpapers on that space. Hope this helps!  <comment12659> Interesting: if I run the first two `tell`s and `set change interval to 3600.0` background won't change, but the "change background image every…" setting from the prefpane gets deselected. If I reselect the delay, background changes. Now: if I run the same applescript commands again the background changes *to the same image what was set at the first place*. And if I rereselect the "change background image every…" setting again, background changes to the same image as in last reselect. So it goes back and forth between two pictures. <comment12662> … And if I run the whole applescript you provided, but just without any references to `theSwitch` the "random order" option in the prefpane gets deselected, but "change background every…" setting remains intact :-D I think I need to downvote this answer as that nor the comments in the link you provided won't work — sorry! If someone can confirm that this works for him/her, I'll happily retract my vote. <comment12750> I had to retest that script as you said it works. *Now* it *did* change the background and no settings were lost! [Maybe a reboot or two between the tests had something to do with it…](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t70-gO9N5bI) I'm certain I tested that as I even tried the `Delay 3` trick mentioned in the same reply! Thanks a bunch :-) I hope the link above won't distract you too much. <comment12798> @koiyu Glad to hear you made it work :) I had seen the UK version of the IT Crowd, but good pointer nonetheless. ;) <comment150788> @user48556 : Can we cross fade the changing of the wallpaper??? Thanks.
