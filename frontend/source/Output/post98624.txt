Flash Player 11.8 install fails with error code 30 listed in console <body> I am installing the most recent Flash Player 11 for Firefox/Safari, and after running the .pkg from Finder the installation always fails at 50%. I find this error in the console at the end of installation:  precode8/11/13 12:46:07.911 PM [0x0-0xf30f3].com.solidstatenetworks.awkhost: 2013-08-11 12:46:07.910 Adobe Flash Player Install Manager[1628:707]  Install failed with error code: 30. /code/pre  This has happened for the past few minor releases, not just current (11.8.800.94). How can I complete the installation? I am running Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.  <answer98625> I completed the installation by running the installer as root from the shell, under its mountpoint at code/Volumes/code. The full path to the installer executable's directory is code/Volumes/Adobe Flash Player Installer/Install Adobe Flash Player.app/Contents/MacOS/code  This thread in Adobe forums describes the underlying problem - the current user can't write to a directory the installer needs. delInstead of chmod'ing the folder, I already had root enabled, and went from there successfully./del  strongUpdate:/strong Commentor is right, root is too risky. Follow the chmod route.  <answer122308> The thread in the Adobe forums didn't help me. For me Console made no mention of a permissions problem in /var/folders like that thread says. I had to use sudo on the command line to get it installed. Pity but what else can one do.  <answer237000> Use the sudo command then copy and paste where the executable file is at. It worked for me with the latest version. I think the problem is caused by rootless.  <answer257732> In addition to running the installation program from the Terminal command line as 'root', I also had to go into Safari Preferences / Security / Plug-In Settings and change the Adobe Flash Player's "When visiting other web sites" from "No" to "Ask".  <comment129695> Due to the poor security of Adobe software, I would advise no one to run them as `root`. Changing the access modes of the necessary directory is an acceptable work around to help an ill conceived installer. Most notably this software installer hadn't been tested with a real user account â˜¹.
