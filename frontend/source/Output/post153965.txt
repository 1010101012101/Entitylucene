How to download all photos and videos stored in iCloud? <body> I'm a mac user. Latest yosemite and itunes installed on my mac. Want to download all data from iCloud photo library and to disable auto upload future. Is there any way to download all photos and videos all at once?  <answer153998>    In iPhoto or Aperture preferences on your Mac, select Photos (or Photo Stream)  My Photo Stream  Automatic Import. All of your photo stream photos will import into your Events, Projects, Photos, Faces, and Places folders in iPhoto or Aperture.   From My Photo Stream FAQ  <comment226217> The user specifically asked about iCloud Photo Library, which is not the same thing as My Photo Stream.
