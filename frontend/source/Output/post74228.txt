How to export the contact photo in Mountain Lion? <body> I want to use the photo of a contact in the Address Book/Contacts in another app. What is the easiest way to emexport/em the contact photo in Mountain Lion to an image file? Dragging it out to the desktop does not work for me: I always get the photo strongResize/strong window instead.  <answer81317> Assuming Mountain Lion 10.8.strong2/strong:  ol liClick on the photo in Contacts/li liClick once to select the one you want from the resulting grid of available photos/li liClick on the icon with the pencil across it at the bottom left of the grid window./li liClick on the larger version of the image that appears, and copy the image to the clipboard./li /ol  Assuming Mountain Lion 10.8.strong4/strong:  ol liClick on the photo in Contacts/li liMake sure the image opens in the large Pop-up underneath the small image./li liClick on the larger image./li liCopy the image to the clipboard, e.g. via command-C./li /ol  You can now paste the image anywhere you want.   For example, you can open Preview and, when it's ready, select the menu emFile &lt; New from Clipboard/em, and a new window will open with the photo in it. You can then save that file in any format available to anywhere you wish.  <answer169073> Trying on emOS X Yosemite 10.10.1/em:  On OS X 10.8 it was possible to extract a photo from contacts on the Mac user interface. That did not work for me on the current version.br Thus I went to look in the code~/Library/code.  I found the picture I had taken under  pre ~/Library/Application\ Support/AddressBook/Sources/(some long hex string)/Images/ /pre  Thus on Finder click the "Go To" menu, holding the kbd‚å• ALT/kbd. Click on "Library", then navigate to the Images folder.  (On my iPhone, in Contacts, I had taken a photo of a friend yesterday. Today I wanted to file the photo, found it as above on my Mac, though with a size of 87 KB only.)  <comment113340> In OSX 10.8.4 it works a bit different: You do not get a grid, just the edit pop-up. The correct workflow for this should appear in the answer soon.
