How can I incorporate LaTeX into an iBook created with iBooks Author? <body> I'm interested in writing a text in the sciences that requires some mathematical notation, but I see no way to incorporate LaTeX into iBooks using iBooks Author.  Am I missing a feature? Is there an add-on plug-in architecture (e.g. using "widgets") that would allow me to add a tool for LaTeX editing. Are there any existing LaTeX "widgets" or add-ons?   hr  Ideally, I'm seeking something other than a "one-way" static PDF- or image-generation approach.  <answer37715> IF you rendered the LaTeX into a PDF, you could certainly paste the resulting image into iBooks Author, but this is hardly an optimal solution.  <answer37716> h1LaTeXiT/h1  ...is the solution I'll go with now. You can export your Latex as a picture which can be very easily copied into iBooks Author.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CFqzE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment42802> Of course you want more than a "one-way" generated rendering. So do I; you just beat me to posting this question! I posted a one-way solution as an answer in the hope that it might help generate a more useful answer, and one-way is better than no way. <comment45074> Let Apple know about this issue : http://www.apple.com/feedback/ibooks-author.html
