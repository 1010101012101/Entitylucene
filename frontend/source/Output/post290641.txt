Mid-2011 MacBook Air SSD upgrade <body> I have a mid-2011 MBA with 128 GB SSD, running El Capitan. I bought an adapter for m.2 SATA drive (which will probably be Samsung Evo 850), but I can't find any trustworthy guide on how to swap the drives.  I don't have any other Apple PC hardware, and my working knowledge about how things work in MacOS is limited.  I have full TimeMachine backup of current OS/data, and I will additionally backup data to external drive prior to move. I then plan to sell 128 GB SSD on ebay, so I will need to wipe it first.  I want to install Sierra from scratch, if possible.  I know that MBA has firmware/boot utility that allows over-the-internet install, but since the device came with Lion, I don't think it will work. To prepare USB drive with Sierra, I will need Sierra already installed, right? Or can I do it from within El Captain?  Can someone please provide me a procedure which I should follow to make sure I end up with wiped current drive and Sierra installed on the new one?
