Synchronising flags in apple mail between multiple macs <body> I have a Macbook Air and an iMac - both using Apple Mail connected to an exchange server.  I have now noticed that flagged emails are different and seem to be out of sync between them.  I have tried applying a flag to a new email and it does seem to apply to both.  I do however file emails away in folders.   Any help would be appreciated.  <comment255184> IMAP or POP? POP will certainly not sync flags
