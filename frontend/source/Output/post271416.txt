Wrong reminders badge on macOS Sierra <body> My Reminders dock badge shows 6 reminders (am using macOS Sierra 10.12.3)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIpsM.png" alt="enter image description here"  But there are only 2 due:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L4gji.png" alt="enter image description here"  I already tried:  ul liClosing Reminders, killing the Dock, reopening Reimenders/li liEnabling the Debug menu and refreshing/li /ul  Reminders are synced with iCloud and Exchange, all other devices have the right count of open reminders.  Any other ideas?  <comment341299> Have you tried "force quit" (alt+click) reminders? <comment341300> Yes it's the only way to quit. The application does not respond <comment341301> You didn't mention this information in your question - app doesn't respond. Are reminders synced via iCloud? Do you also see the same error on other devices with what your iCloud is synchronised? Have you tried restarting your machine? <comment341310> Sorry, I mixed two questions I had on AskDifferent. Sorry, Reminders is responding and working normally. <comment341418> If you've figured out what is the issue feel free to answer your own question or delete it because you've mixed two questions.
