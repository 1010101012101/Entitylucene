How to locate "other" files on an Imac <body> When I look at my available disk space on my imac it says ive used 700 gigs for "other" files. How do i find these files and delete them?  <answer165050> I use a app called OmniDisk Sweeper.  It allows me to find all files and delete the one I do not want.  In case of a application I use the AppCleaner application that not only deletes the app but all associated stuff with it.  <comment193593> Just to clarify, Mac uses "other" for all files that do not fit the preset category! (that is sometimes confusing. <comment193754> Oh ok so that means the space is not necessarily unavilable?? <comment193756> Correct :) it is bit misleading but that is what it says. <comment195005> Awesome thanks for the clarification! :)
