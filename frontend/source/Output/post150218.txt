File size per video minute on iPhone 6? <body> What would be an average file size if recording 1 minute of video on the iPhone 6? Normal speed, no slow motion.  <answer150224> I checked now and it is 130 MB / minute.  <answer201423> 60 FPS 10 minutes video 1.3 GB.  <answer247149> My iPhone6 22 minute video is 3.1GB. 3100/22 = 140MB per minute.  This is 1920 x 1080 (1080p) @ 30 fps.  I checked the Frames Per Second in SettingsPhotos &amp; CameraRecord Video in my iPhone6 menu. I saw it was 1920x1080 pixels per frame when I imported the video to my Macbook using a program called Image Capture.  <comment176830> If you've answered your own question, mark it as answered so that other people can see that it's answered :) <comment176831> For 30fps or 60fps video? <comment176832> You cannot do that within 48 hours. <comment176841> Sweet jesus that's high! I guess they aren't using lossy compression? <comment242805> Keep in mind that the answers below will vary because of file compression. Some scenes are more compressible than others. For example, a video with a constant background and small foreground subject is highly compressible because most of the picture stays constant between frames. A fast moving video shot on a roller coaster would have little similarity between frames, and would be less compressible (thus, larger). <comment242844> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.
