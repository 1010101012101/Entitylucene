Corrupt .photoslibrary file in Photos app. Any way to get photos back? <body> I am using Apple's strongPhotos/strong app on macOS El Capitan.  When trying to copy my codePhotos Library.photoslibrary/code file (44 gigs) from old external drive to new internal drive, I get a code-36/code error. Apparently the file is corrupt.   Are all my photos lost? Are those photos stored externally as files somewhere else on the disk?   <answer294579> In strongFinder/strong, right-click the codePhotos Library.photoslibrary/code file and click codeShow Package Contents/code. Inside you will find a folder named codeMasters/code. It contains all your originals, organized by date. If you’ve made no edits to your photos, then that’s all you need.  If copying codeMasters/code fails, you can try copying individual subfolders until you’ve isolated the corrupted folders/photos. This will at least allow you to salvage the vast majority of your photos, instead of losing the entire library.  The code-36/code error in strongFinder/strong is often caused by corrupt code./code files (typically code.DS_Store/code). Thankfully there is a handy command-line utility named codedot_clean/code that will attempt to fix this issue for you. It’s a good idea to have a backup of your photos before using any repair tool, so do this after you’ve copied your codeMasters/code folder somewhere safe.  Open a strongTerminal/strong session and type the following:br codedot_clean ~/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary//codebr This is assuming your Photos Library is in the default location. Since you’re using an external drive, replace code~/Pictures/code with the correct path (prefixing spaces with code\/code).  Now try copying your codePhotos Library.photoslibrary/code file once again. If this still fails, try repairing your external drive using strongDisk Utility/strong and running strongFirst Aid/strong on it.  And as a last resort, you can try repairing your Photos Library. Quit out of strongPhotos/strong completely by pressing kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbdq/kbd. Then relaunch the app by holding kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd⌥ opt/kbd while clicking the icon in your dock. Finally choose codeRepair/code.  Leave the app alone while it does its thing and don't interact with it in any way.
