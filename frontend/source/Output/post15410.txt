installing python2.4 on osx10.6? <body> I prefer installing stuff from their source and dont use package managers generally. Has anyone here tried building python2.4 from source here? If so, had any luck with the same?   <answer15428> Probably you have some troubles building it from a sources. My 0.02$:  ul licheck here https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/python24/li /ul  In the codefiles/code subdir you can see the needed patches to sources, but especially the patches needed to the codeMakefile/code and codeconfigure/code, for the successful build. Use the above as a learning material for your own build process.  emPs: only wondering, what is wrong with macports.org? Why does not use it directly? All things are builded/compiled on your machine from the sources and you can always check the patches and so on... (so, no binary installs)./em  <comment16716> I use package managers which build from source to see where the issues are and how they were fixed - so I can just look at the patches from the package manager to see the issues - or for python just get it from python.org
