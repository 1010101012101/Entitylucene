Strange colors on my iPhone screen <body> The icon for the Messages app looks grayish or blue. My app icons are different from the standard colors. The settings menu is black with white letters.    My phone has not been dropped recently or near any water, and the "Inverted Colors" in Settings  General  Accessibility is off.br It is not jailbroken.  What else could be causing this problem?  <comment238001> Welcome to Ask Different! Could you please elaborate on your problem? Add a screenshot maybe? Blue messages signal that you and the recipient have activated iMessage. <comment238002> Like the message icon , is blue . Jaime Danta Cruz <comment238003> The message icon on your home screen? <comment238004> Yes, and other apps are not the normal color. And my pictures look like I have the inverted thing and I do not have it on. <comment238005> Have you dropped or hit your iPhone recently? <comment238006> No, not that I recall.. <comment238007> Check on Settings, is the screen black with white letters there? <comment238009> Yes there is, but the icons are some same colors and some different colors. <comment238010> Go to Settings  General  Accesibility and check if "Invert Colors" is switched on <comment238011> I just checked for about the fifth time and it's not on. <comment238012> Other than that, it could be your screen, that's why I asked if you had dropped it. Maybe water damage? <comment238013> I haven't dropped it, no cracks or anything on the phone and I don't usually have my phone around water. <comment238014> I see no other settings that would change system colors in the way you describe, sorry. Is it jailbroken? <comment238015> It's not jailbroken. <comment238016> Please edit your question to add this information so other people can help. Right now it has received downvotes probably because it is difficult to understand what you mean. <comment238018> Have you power cycled the iPhone, turning it completely off and back on? <comment238023> Settings  General  Accessibility  Grayscale is also off right? <comment238025> Yes  at the both of you <comment238027> I suggested an edit to your question, let's see if it passes thru. <comment238028> I did edit it already .
