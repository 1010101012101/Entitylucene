How to AirPlay or stream video to PlayStation 3 from OS X? <body> I'm hitting brick walls it seems on finding any topics that pertain to streaming video and / or live display to a PlayStation 3.  I am not sure if I'm just missing the correct terminology or if a solution simply doesn't exist.  My primary goal is to be able to stream videos to a PlayStation 3 similar to how Beamer works.  A bonus would be to stream AirPlay. Are there any solutions for such scenarios?  <answer163362> Using airplay to stream music to your ps3 is not possible because airplay is a function that is only available on apple devices.  If you want to stream music to your os3, you will need a media server on your mac.  Most of the times I use vuse to stream my media to my ps3/4 or smart tv.  <answer167232> Just came looking to see if I could use Airplay, as it would be very convenient to be able to stream from any of my devices.    However, I have been using medialink for years, using my mac mini as a media server.  It had some troubles when it first came out, but in recent years I've found it extremely reliable, quality is excellent for all definitions.  <comment191233> Interesting, but unfortunately Vuze has not worked for my situation.  The primary issue is that the PS3 simply will not show up in Vuze and vice versa. Doesn't seem to be a firewall issue either, so I'm not sure what actually prevents it from being seen either way. <comment191234> After a quick google search i came to this site: http://serviio.org, perhaps that is wat you need <comment191306> funny thing is is that I tried that one and it just simply hung.  Never could get it to work.  I've tried Plex as well with not much success.  Really hoped to get something a little more along the lines of `Beamer` as noted initially. <comment302246> There are many non-Apple devices that can *receive* AirPlay signals. <comment334445> just get an old apple tv 2, you won't look back. makes streaming music and video a breeze from your iOS devices and from your MacOS. it is the best device i've bought in the past 2-3 years (we had 2 iOS devices and 1 Macbook at home).
