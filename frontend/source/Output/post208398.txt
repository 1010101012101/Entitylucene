Automatic text replacement [substitution], space to replace <body> It seems that to replace text (Prefs/Keyboard Shortcuts/Text), one has to type a space after the keyword, and this inserts a space after the replacement text. Is there a way around this?  <answer208413> It depends on how you have the global pref &amp; also the prefs in each app...  Bear in mind there are 2 ways to trigger it - whether you have "Correct spelling automatically" set or not  Of course, you need Text replacement on, in for instance, Safari  Edit  Substitutions  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jo6VA.png" alt="enter image description here"  but then if you also havebr Edit Menu  Spelling &amp; Grammar  Check Spelling While Typing emand also/em Check Spelling Automatically    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lJc4E.png" alt="enter image description here"br then as you start to type a substitution, it will first auto-suggest underneathbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x0FHK.png" alt="enter image description here"br As soon as it auto-suggests, you have 2 options...    ul liHit kbd Enter ⌅ /kbd &amp; it will auto-fill &amp; add a space, or  /li liHit kbd ↓ /kbd then kbd Enter ⌅ /kbd &amp; it will strongnot/strong leave a space/li /ul  The real down-side of having it set like this is if you're not expecting it to correct something &amp; it does, without you noticing. Any slightly unusual word or spelling can get auto-corrected to a simpler... yet wrong one, if you don't proof-read.
