How to iterate through multiple file extension without caring about case sensitivity? <body> I've seen various topics on how to iterate through multiple file extensions, but in most cases the list is defined.  example:   precodefor file in ${arg}/**/*.{txt,h,py} do     .... done /code/pre  As can be seen, .TXT files would be ignored. And sadly, the guy who answered it says it only works for bash4. Mavericks is using bash 3.x  Any ideas on how it can be done on OS X?  <answer139707> Use codefind/code:  precodefind "$arg" -iname \*.txt -o -iname \*.h -o -iname \*.py|while read f;do :;done /code/pre  Use codeIFS= read -r/code if the paths can end with spaces or contain backslashes.  Or install bash 4:  precodebrew install bash;echo /usr/local/bin/bash|sudo tee -a /etc/shells;chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  Then:  precode shopt -s globstar nocaseglob;for f in "$arg"/**/*.{txt,h,py};do :;done /code/pre  codeshopt -s nocaseglob/code also works with bash 3.2.  <comment164627> I advise you to read: http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=pattern+matching+insensitive and post your question on Stackoverflow. <comment164628> stackoverflow is for programming questions :) though admittedly, people tend to use it for anything computer related <comment164631> Shell scripting questions related to OS X (including the standard bash version) are on-topic here.
