Can I remote desktop into a Windows-based corporate network from my iPad? <body>    strongPossible duplicate:/strongbr           iPads in the corporate world   Has anyone remote desktop into a Windows-based corporate network with an iPad? What has been your experience? How do you address the issue of multiple domains? Is this even possible?   Currently, I just connect my laptop to a network cable and remote desktop from one domain into another domain to get to my desktop computer into a different location.  Is this possible with an iPad? How would my regular network cable connect to an iPad?  <answer3002> If you’re talking about accessing a Remote Desktop via a RDC Client, There are a lot of applications that work fine. I’m personally using iTap Mobile RDP and it’s fantastic.  <answer3005> To answer your networking question: You can connect an iPad to a computer, or to a Wi-Fi connection (or both), but you can't connect an Ethernet cable to an iPad.  <comment2662> I think he wants something else, he wants your experience about RDC and something else at the end, I don't get what exactly he means. <comment2663> Yeah, the question is weird, but since the tag is iPad, I’m assuming he wants to access (via RDC) to a Windows Corporate network. My Experience is that iTap works fine and I don’t see the issue with multiple domains because you can select your domain when you log (or create multiple connections). Let’s see what the OP Says. <comment2668> Dori, I just googled and it may be possible. Please let me know otherwise. http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB442Z/A <comment2670> @dotnet-practitioner You would also need the Camera Connection Kit for that to even have a chance of working, because the stock iPad doesn't have a usb port. USB keyboards work with the kit, but I doubt this would, since there would have to be drivers in iOS to support it. <comment2671> @dotnet-practitioner - if you read further down the page you linked to, there are two questions in the Q&A section about precisely this. And again, the answer is "No." In [Dear Aunt TUAW: Will my MacBook Air Ethernet adapter work with my iPad?](http://www.tuaw.com/2010/07/19/dear-aunt-tuaw-will-my-macbook-air-ethernet-adapter-work-with-m/), TUAW came to the same conclusion as well.
