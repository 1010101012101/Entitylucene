OS X internet access without connection <body> My Macbook Pro only connects to the Internet with cable because the router is too far away to connect with Wi-Fi (doesn't even appear as AP in Wi-Fi settings).  Some weeks ago something really strange happened:  After disconnecting the Ethernet cable, usually there is no internet connection. But all of a sudden I realized that I could still browse the Internet. First thought was that those must be cached websites but then I tried random websites and it worked too.  ul liCable: Disconnected. /li liWi-Fi: Enabled but not connected to any AP./li liBluetooth: Disabled./li /ul  I also have DropBox installed whose icon in the menu bar turns black if there is an active Internet connection. The first minutes the icon was greyed out (but I could still browse the internet) then it turned black - still cable was disconnected, wifi and bluetooth didn't show any active connection.  When I later checked the network settings a new Network interface appeared:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2VmZE.png" alt="enter image description here"  I couldn't find anything on Google regarding this issue so maybe someone here knows what could cause this behaviour.  <comment349176> What you are describing is impossible so it stands to reason you are still connected.  What you need to provide is the output of `ifconfig -a` and `ping www.apple.com` when you believe you are disconnected from the internet
