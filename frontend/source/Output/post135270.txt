Edit URL in address bar when title matches in Safari <body> In Safari 6.1, under MacÂ OS 10.8, if I type a text in the address bar that matches the emtitle/em of a page I have previously visited, that page is listed below. I select it and would then like to slightly edit the related URL. Instead, it only lets me editing the page title, and when pressing enter it performs a web search with the edited title. How can I change this behaviour?  This still applies in Safari 10.0 under macOS 10.11.6.  Pressing the right arrow key after the page emtitle/em matches only takes you to the end of the page title.  The URL is displayed to the right of the cursor, but does not appear to be editable.  Here is a screenshot of a matched page emtitle/em, before pressing the right arrow key:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ZBAG.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is after pressing the right arrow key.  Note that further presses of the right arrow key do not affect anything.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyubR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer266056> This may only apply to recent OS X &amp; Safari; I can't test back to 10.8br This is using Safari 10.0.2 on El Capitan 10.11.6  Currently, you can do it by hitting the right arrow, which will take you to the end of the auto-filled line, from where you can edit as you wish  examples...

Safari chose to match to the URL. It therefore does not answer the question. <comment333857> Then I have no idea what you mean. Editing your question to clarify might be useful. <comment354860> I found this same behavior.  I edited the question to clarify and add screenshots. <comment354874> Safari 10.1 (on macOS 10.11.6 and 10.12.4) has the page title given in the small blue text and the URL in editable black, which is reversed from your screenshots and sounds like the behavior you desire. <comment354877> After the edit - best guess is 'you cannot do that'. You are in effect typing a search, not a URL - all you can edit is the search.
