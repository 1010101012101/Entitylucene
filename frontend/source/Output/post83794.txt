iPhone 5 broken glass replacement <body> My friend recently broke his iPhone 5. He has broken just the front glass. Everything works very fine: LCD, touch screen, etcâ€¦  Is there any possibility to change only the front glass that costs, on eBay, 9.99$? Not whole digitizer with LCD? I've not found any video with this.  <answer83805> The iPhone 5's front glass is part of the LCD screen, not as in the iPhone 4 where you could only change the back glass (I am almost sure that the front glass in iPhone 4/4S was also separate from the screen).  Therefore, must change the whole screen.  <comment96460> The front glass on the 4/4S was separate from the screen, so you could change that as well. <comment96488> Thx, that's all I want to know.
