Which key is Insert on Microsoft Remote Desktop? <body> I use my Mac connected to a remote server (Windows 2008) using Microsoft Remote Desktop Beta, and in the Windows 2008, there is a virtual machine on it, I use the Xshell connected to the VM.  But when I want to paste some code, the shortcut key is kbdShift/kbd+kbdInsert/kbd, however on the Mac there is no kbdInsert/kbd key. How can I use the shortcut key to paste my code?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JfhkC.jpg" alt=""  <answer285378> There is currently no way to use an insert key with Microsoft Remote Desktop Beta.
