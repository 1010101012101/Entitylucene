Volume/Folder/File Permissions: Administrators (Group) R+/W+ v. Admin (User) R+/W+ <body> If the Administrators (Group) is set to have R+/W+ access, do individual Admin Users need to be specifically set to have R+/W+ access or are they hierarchically included as falling within the Admins group?  Also, is there a list somewhere that clarifies the (complete) hierarchy of all these Users &amp; Groups that become visible when you Option Click the plus sign on the Permissions panel? I've found partial lists, but they don't cover even 1/3rd of the entries.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RGnhp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
