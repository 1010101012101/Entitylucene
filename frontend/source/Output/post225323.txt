Keyboard/trackpad joint failure, resolved on TWO reboots <body> The keyboard and trackpad on my MacBook Pro stopped working suddenly. They went completely unresponsive. The power button did work, though, so I managed to reboot using it. Upon the FIRST reboot, the keyboard/trackpad problem persisted. This is where I started to panic. I forced shutdown again, disassembled the laptop, and used compressed air to clean the interior. Upon reassembly and SECOND reboot, the keyboard and trackpad were working again.  How likely do you think it is a hardware issue? May compressed air have helped clear up some internal connectivity issue (due to, say, some dust particle getting stuck)? Or was this a complete coincidence and it was a software issue—say, might it have been some kind of malfunction due to overheating and disassembly/reassembly coincidentally took enough time to let the MacBook cool down?  Any input would be greatly appreciated.  hr  MacBook Pro, OS X Mavericks (10.9.5)  <comment273434> What year Macbook Pro? This is a not uncommon occurrence on my 2015 model, but only when waking from sleep. I've been using Apple laptops since 2005, but things like that, and with the 10 second freeze every time I plug in a USB device (both problems commonly reported so not unique to me) does make me wonder whether the time is coming to look elsewhere next time. <comment273474> @scottishwildcat It’s a 2011 model. That’s why I’m especially worried about hardware failure, maybe its lifetime is going to expire soon. <comment273610> Hmm, ok. The only suggestion I've really found for such issues is to reset the SMC -- have you tried that? (Caveat: hasn't really helped me.) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295
