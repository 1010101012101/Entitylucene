Excel 2011 crashes when printing certain worksheets <body> Excel 2011 (for Mac) consistently crashes on certain code.xlsx/code files, at the moment I want to print it (either directly to the printer or to PDF). With Excel 2016 (both Windows and Mac), it works fine.  The only thing I know, the Excel is created by a colleague who uses Excel for Windows.  <answer284692> The Excel-worksheet probably contains an embedded OLE object. Within Excel you can check this by right clicking each "image". When the context-menu's last option is codeFormat object/code, you found it.  To fix it, choose the option codeSave as image/code and choose a location and name. Then delete the object, and insert the previously saved image.  hr  There is also stronganother way to check for embedded objects/strong. An code.xlsx/code file is actually also a code.zip/code file. You can rename the extension so you can unzip it (or use codeunzip filename.xlsx -d directory_to_unzip_to/code on the command line).  When the newly created folder contains a folder codexl/embeddings/code, and this folder contains at least one file, the excel contains an embedded object.
