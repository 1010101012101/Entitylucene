This actually succeeded once, I think; subsequent attempts fail because it is "not currently available from the software update server."    xcode is installed and up to date, including the command line utilities.  Also, I used homebrew to install g++-4.8, so things are located in /usr/local/Cellar/.  Other suggestions have been to (compile? link?) /opt/local/lib/gcc48/libstdc++.a, which I changed to /usr/local/Cellar/gcc48/4.8.1/gcc/lib/libstdc++.a because I'm using brew, not MacPorts -- but I haven't figured out where that belongs.  <comment135276> Did you compiled the object files on the same machine? <comment135520> I think you need to add some more context, like what you are building, how you are building it, and how to reproduce it.  It's probably a mixup of compiler and standard library, but it's hard to say more without seeing more details. <comment139303> FWIW, I can reproduce the problem and have submitted a [bug report](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/issues/347).
