How to recover Old BackUp? <body> I recently made a full backup of my iPhone 7 to my computer a day back. I was adding some new songs in Itunes then I connected the Phone to those songs.  Unfortunately as soon as Iphone connected to iTunes, it automatically made a full back-up of my phone, and I now can't see the previous back-up I made. Please tell me!  How to recover that Old BackUp.  <answer267958> iTunes usually just updates the previous backup as part of its incremental backup process. But you can look in the iTunes Preferences -  Devices tab to see all of the backups iTunes sees to make sure:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204215  To make extra sure that there's not a partial or broken backup that iTunes isn't seeing, you can also go look in the folder for the backups. Here's an article I wrote with instructions for getting to the iTunes backups folder on different OSes:  https://deciphertools.com/blog/where-are-iphone-backups/  <comment336279> I think you question is already answered here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/94983/restoring-an-old-iphone-backup#104865
