Macbook Battery calibration craziness <body> As explained at this Superuser question, I've bought a generic battery for my 2008 Macbook but didn't need it. Based on the answers, I've decided to use my new battery and proceeded to try to calibrate it as recommended by the user manual it came with.  The battery was from a reputable seller and I do not think it is a dud. Having said that, it is from China and the manual is in poorly written English but it is clear enough and it recommends that I  ol liDisable power saving features of OS (was for a part for a macbook but it talks about Windows!)/li liDrain the battery to exhaustion/li liRecharge to 100% for 4-5 hours!/li liRepeat discharge/charge cycle 4-5 times/li /ol  So,   ul lion the first discharge, the machine powered off at about 60% of charge!/li lion the second discharge, it lost power at about 95%!!/li /ul  Worried about the filesystem state, I booted in Single-User mode, removed the power and in a loop kept checking the battery using codeioreg/code.   After about 1.5-2 hours, the power was down to 3% and still going!  What gives?  <comment173763> Since the supplier is reputable, can you mention their name, and the make and model of the battery?  Are you able to find whether Apple has approved the battery as a Mac accessory? <comment173801> It was an ebay seller from China. Their rating was very good which is what I was referring to. As for being approved by Apple, I am sure it is not.
