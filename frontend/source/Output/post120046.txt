Putting "widgets" on Mac desktop <body> Is there any software to put certain "widgets" on the desktop, such as notes or a clock? I would like to have apps permanently affixed there, rather than being open as separate apps or hovering over other windows.  <answer120080> There is an application called the Dashboard that houses widgets. Below is a screenshot of the app icon, and another screenshot of my Dashboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ISGYY.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H0tX8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer120081> In some versions of Mac OS X it is possible to detach widgets from the Dashboard and leave them on the desktop.  h2Enable Dashboard Development Mode/h2  ol liLaunch strongUtilities/strong  strongTerminal.app/strong/li liIssue the command codedefaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES/code/li liIssue the command codekillall Dock/code/li liQuit strongTerminal.app/strong/li liDisplay the Dashboard; using the kbdF12/kbd key/li liClick and hold on a widget/li liHide the Dashboard; using the kbdF12/kbd key/li liIn development mode, the widget remains visible and can now be positioned on the Desktop/li /ol  These steps were originally for Mac OS X 10.4 but this technique is reported to still work with 10.8, Mountain Lion.  <answer207800> First you have to go to System PrefrencesMission Control and uncheck Show Dashboard as a Space... This still works, killall Dock after moving widgets to desktop  <comment145785> Doesn't Seem to be working in Mavericks. Just saying because the OP tagged `Mavericks`. <comment145786> I am also unable to recreate this on OS X 10.9.2; Apple appears to have removed the behaviour. <comment174973> This does not answer the questionâ€¦ <comment225464> Works in Mavericks. OS X 10.10.3. However, they still float above all other windows. <comment294147> works. then click the Plus sign at the bottom to add widgets..
