Can I use my 2010 iMac as a display for my 2011 MBP? <body> My Belkin Mini DisplayPort to MiniDisplayPort cable has just arrived. I have the laptop plugged into the iMac. Everything is arranged the way I need it, except for one thing.  How can I cycle between using my actual iMac and the MBP? Sort of like expose to shift between desktops?  <answer35773> Have you tried: kbdCmd/kbd + kbdF2/kbd  I've connected my MacBook Air with my iMac, and it just works fine.  But you have no change to see the two devices at the same time.   <comment40772> Whether you can do that depends on your iMac.
