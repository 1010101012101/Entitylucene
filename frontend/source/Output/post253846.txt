Does Xcode 7.3.1 run on MacOS Sierra (10.12)? <body> i have both x code 7.3.1 and x code 8 installed on OS X 10.11 and i need them both to manage my apps written with swift language.  i have downloaded both from apple website (not from app store) and i still keep the setup files (.dmg &amp; .xip)  will xcode 7.3.1 still work on sierra if i upgrade?  thanks in advance.  <answer253854> Yes it works. I have macOS Sierra with Xcode 7.3.1.  Tested:  ul liSimulators/li liDebug on device/li liValidate/Upload to store/li liCocoaPods/li /ul  <comment316060> thanks for your answer. is it fully functional after update? i heard that the simulator stops working <comment316079> Are cocoapods and Carthage working well? <comment316094> @user2602020 See above <comment316097> @RobinThuranMalhotra I do not know for Carthage. I installed macOS Sierra GM seed a few days before the release and I was surprised how well it worked. There was one documented issue for homebrew (and easy to fix) and a very specific issue with a custom keyboard layout I use. I do not see any issue on Carthage's Hub about macOS Sierra. <comment325868> Hi, with Sierra official released, can Xcode 7 still workable ? As I still need to support iOS 6. <comment325912> @neobie Last week we archived an app using 7.3.1. We submitted the 7.3.1 archive using Xcode 8 since there is a bug with the submission now in Xcode 7. The app was released to the app store just fine. <comment325913> @neobie, at this point it is not Sierra that will prevent you to release to iOS 6 but when Apple will decide it otherwise.
