iOS 9 Automatic Update? <body> Will iOS 9 automatically install on an iPhone? Or will it give an option to install now or later?  And if I choose later, then will it install aautomatically later, or just not suggest it again?  <answer207813> You will get a notification on your iPhone or in iTunes about iOS 9 update. It will not install automatically. You have the option to install it immediately or at a later time. If you are choosing for a later update scheme, it will show the number 1 as a badge in Settings icon on your iPhone.  <answer207847> iPhone will only automactic download the ios not automatic-install it, so whatever what option you choose that is strong"not"/strong or strong"delay"/strong it will not install the ios automaticly.  <comment250725> Thanks! So if I choose later, it will only show the red badge and not automatically update? <comment250727> @Snowbooks1419 yes. It won't automatically update. <comment251147> That question was for previous iOS Updates. This question is specific to iOS 9.
