iPad and iPhone show one delivered iMessage but not on the other. Is message delivered? <body> Sent message from iPad or iPhone and message does not say delivered. But when I look at other device it shows delivered. Is message delivered? Example message sent from iPhone no delivered status. Look at same message on IPad and shows delivered status.   <comment359568> Do you have the option turned on on your iPhone to receive read a read receipt? I don't know how the function is called but you can find it in Settings  Messages <comment359612> Yes this is set on for both my iPad and iPhone. Just not sure why one says delivered and the other one doesn't. I have tried it both ways. Send from iPhone & shows delivered on iPad but not iPhone. Then send from iPad & shows delivered on iPhone but not iPad.
