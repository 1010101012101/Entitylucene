Certain Calendars do not trigger iPhone Notifications <body> I've got three calendars set up on my iPhone:  ul liMicrosoft Exchange/li lioutlook.com (Windows Live)/li liicloud/li /ul  I've got entries in the first two calendars. However, I only get notifications from the Exchange Events as set up into them (like 15 minutes before, and so on). On the other hands, I won't get notifications on outlook.com-Events.  Both calendars are synchronized exactly the same, notifications for calendar at all are set, I can see all the events with different colours in my Calendar App, but I won't get any notice at the outlook.com Events...  Anyone knows what I forgot?  <answer237247> In your Calendars app, press the "Calendars" button on the bottom, and press the code(i)/code that shows up next to each calendar in the list of calendars. Scroll to the bottom of the settings there, and there should be a toggle for Event Alerts. Turn this on for each individual calendar.  <comment290474> They are all turned on already... Additionally, if I disable them and leave the menu, they get resetted to "enabled".... <comment290475> @FlorianM端ller Maybe you're not setting event alerts when you create an alert for your outlook-live calendar? <comment290476> @FlorianM端ller If you choose to edit one of the outlook-live calendar events, what does it say in the "Alert" field? And what about for an event in your Exchange calendar? <comment290478> I can set "Notification" on both kinds of events on predefined values such as "2 days before" "5 mins before" and so on.. <comment290484> @FlorianM端ller If you download the Outlook app, does your outlook-live calendar function as expected? <comment290485> @FlorianM端ller Also try this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2787708
