Merging keyboard shortcuts <body> How could I create a new keyboard shortcut to merge other shortcuts?br In particular I would like to merge kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdC/kbd, kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdF/kbd, kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdV/kbd  (Copy, Find and Paste) - would be useful for instance for Safari.   (a quick way could be automator, but I don't have much experience...maybe this post could help?)  A good example would be the codeuse selection for find/code  (kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbdE/kbd) feature that exists in empreview/em.  Thanks for your help.  <answer269506> So, I found a solution by creating an codeapplescript/code with automator:  precodeon run {input, parameters} tell application "System Events"     key code 8 using command down     delay 0.1     key code 53     key code 3 using command down     key code 9 using command down end tell return input end run /code/pre  emthat does his job/em.  (the reason why there is the emescape/em key - codekey code 53/code - is that I was looking for a solution that works also for for emjupyter notebook/em)  ps: the problem is still to find a shortcut that had no conflict...  <answer269512> I have found a funny way to do this with Karabiner installed.  Add this to your private.xml:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Command sequence&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Option-R&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;remap.option_r2command.cfv&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;         __KeyToKey__         KeyCode::OPTION_R,         Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::C, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,         Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::F, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,         Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::V, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,         &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Then enable it in Change Key  command sequence  Option-R  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ki9h8.png" alt="enter image description here"  A single key press on the right option key will evoke the cascade of command-C/F/V shortcuts.  hr  This doesn't work in Sierra (because Karabiner still isn't Sierra compatible) and depending on the responsiveness of your app you may have to adjust emVK_WAIT_100MS/em  to higher values like emVK_WAIT_300MS/em. You can alternatively use other usually rarely used keys like kbdshift_r/kbd. A shortcut like kbdalt_r/opt_r/kbdkbdX/kbd should also work.  If you want to use kbdalt_r/opt_r/kbdkbdX/kbd as "shortcut" private.xml should look like this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt; &lt;/item&gt;     &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Command sequences&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Option_R-X to Command-C/F/V&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;remap.option_r-x2command.cfv&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;         __KeyToKey__         KeyCode::X, ModifierFlag::OPTION_R,         Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::C, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,         Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::F, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,         Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::V, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,         &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment338486> From what you described, it would *copy* a selection, *find* that selection, and then *paste* that selection.  What exactly would this function do other than find instances of itself and paste over it?  What exactly are you trying to accomplish? <comment338496> @Allan in Safari it would find other instances of a word on the page <comment338498> [That's not what you described - it's what you *thought it would do*](http://www.tamingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/tree-swing-project-management-large.png) but not what you pseudo coded.  That's why I asked the question - what *specifically* do you want to accomplish? <comment338512> @dwightk got my point ;) <comment338537> thanks for your answer, but unfortunately I cannot try as I have sierra - unfortunately I cannot upvote yet your answer :) <comment338541> (it's working in _safari_ and _firefox_) <comment338543> @Allan, you'd have to click the right arrow to get to an instance of the word, but in Safari, those exact keystrokes would put highlighted text into the find field. jjrr described exactly what he wanted to do.
