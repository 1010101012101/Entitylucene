Mail.app rule works only partially <body> I have this Mail rule:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HF1bJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Move Message works great and all messages that fits the rules has been moved to the selected folder.  The issue here, is the Mark as Read part of the rule does not work.  If I alter the order (Mark as Read first and then Move Message) the Mark as Read not works.  Don't know if matters, but strongthe rule applys to an exchange account/strong.  Any ideas on how to solve this issue?  <answer239800> I have the same issue. After being moved to another folder the message is marked as Unread for some reasons. And I don't have any server rules that might do that (I don't have any server rules as a matter of fact).  I'm 99% sure, that you experience such issue with an strongExchange/strong account, because mine are Exchange-related as well. I tested the same rule with non-Exchange account and everything works as it should, all the actions apply correctly.  You can hardly call this an answer. But at least that's an explanation of such behavior. I wanted to write it as a comment, but I don't have enough reputation.  <comment197944> It's working as expected here, on Yosemite - but one thing I always do to prevent any other rule from possibly interfering, is add 'Stop Evaluating rules' to the bottom of every rule I specifically don't want to be processed by any following rule. <comment197962> @Tetsujin I added Stop Evaluating rules, but no differences. Still not work. <comment197967> I can only think to perhaps promote/demote the rule in the list, see if a different placing makes any difference, or deactivate all other rules to test. <comment294448> Welcome to Ask Different!
