How to mount PCIe SSD from MacBook Air in another computer <body> I got this SSD out of an Apple laptop that's broken from liquid damage.  What is this connection called and how do I mount this storage device to retrieve data from it? It looks like PCIe. Does Apple sell a part to mount this via USB adapter or something?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q8oIj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer200921> The physical interface(s) or form factor(s) are Apple proprietary. The different SSDs have 6+12/12+16/8+18/7+17 pins. The electrical/logical interface is PCIe 2.0 2x or 4x (everymac.com also mentions SATA for some older MacBook Airs).  Several adapters for different MacBook (Air) SSDs are available here.  Example: MacBook Air Mid 2013 SSD to PCI-e 4X. Please check the specs and features!  I haven't been able to find an adapter for the MacBook Air Early 2015 SSD there. The latest MacBook Air uses a proprietary PCIe 2.0 4x instead of a proprietary PCIe 2.0 2x interface like older MacBook Airs.  <answer285307> the "SNANSHI 2013-2014 Year MacBook Air A1465 A1466 Pro A1502 A1398 MD712 SSD PCI-e 4X Adapter" for $13.99 worked perfectly for me, and I can use the drive as a primary boot drive for my PC.  The card is recognized as a SATA device in my BIOS, and it works flawlessly.  Good Luck  <comment242165> What MacBook Air model and year is this from? <comment242177> MacBook Air "Core i5" 1.4 13" (Early 2014), Model A1466 (EMC 2632) <comment359777> Looks like a good option: https://www.amazon.com/SNANSHI-2013-2014-MacBook-A1465-Adapter/dp/B012Y8F6A4
