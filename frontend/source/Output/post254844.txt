What is the font used on Console.app in macOS Sierra? <body> Looks like Console.app went through some changes in macOS Sierra. I really liked the font used in that app but can't find it anywhere in the app (probably they disabled changing the font altogether).  <answer254852> The font used in the Console.app on macOS Sierra is the codeSFMono-Regular/code font.  This can be found in code/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/Contents/Resources/Fonts/code  More versions can be found in Xcode8 directories for example here:  code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Fonts//code  <comment321931> Is `SFMono-Regular` the *new* font in OSX Sierra or is it the old font used in El Capitan and earlier? (I prefer the old font.. it's not as "fat"). <comment321932> @ChristopherSchultz As far as I know, SFMono-Regular was introduced in Sierra. <comment321933> Thanks. Any idea what the old font was? <comment321934> @ChristopherSchultz I remember that `menlo` was used in the Xcode app. <comment321936> Strange... I have a MacBook Pro and an iMac, both recently upgraded to Sierra, and both say the font is `Monaco 10pt`. The two fonts look different on the two screens. :( One has antialiasing enabled and the other does not. Changing that setting does not affect the iMac screen while the MacBook font gets very ugly and fuzzy when enabled. Hmm. <comment321937> @ChristopherSchultz please ask a question on a main page. There's no point to discuss this in comments. Maybe someone else has a solution for this.
