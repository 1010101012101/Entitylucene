Is it true that Apple security has been very successful? <body> According to this article, the author mentions that     Apple's App Store still has more high-quality apps, and in terms of security, it hasn't yet been beaten.   Is it true that Apple security is superior to Android, as it has not been beaten yet? Or to what extent is the statement correct?  <answer71997> I'm not sure what they mean by "beaten". If they mean nobody's managed to sneak a malicious app into it, they're wrong: Charlie Miller did -- purely as a as a proof of concept, but Apple banned him from the store anyway (a rather controversial decision). If they mean no other software source has as good a security record, I'm not sure how to properly evaluate it.  <comment83577> +1 for your Charlie Miller link. At first, I thought that Apple would have a better security since everything is being constraint and never thought that Charlie can really `Hack like a champion today` as shown in the video. <comment83616> Questions as these only sollicit debate and are not a good fit for the Q&A form of this site.
