Smart Mailbox filter "Message is not in mailbox" for iCloud mailboxes <body> When I create or edit a strongSmart Mailbox/strong and I want to add filter codeMessage is not in mailbox/code it works fine for all my e-mail accounts except iCloud.  So, if I add such filter in some strongSmart Mailbox/strong settings and would try to add some mailbox from my iCloud account, it will do that, but it will reset it after I press OK - when I open settings for this strongSmart Mailbox/strong again, I see the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVL8o.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, instead of my chosen mailbox that I wanted to exclude there is codeNo mailbox selected/code. And of course this filter doesn't work.  But again, if I add any mailbox from any other account beside iCloud to this filter, it works fine, so the issue is only with iCloud mailboxes.  Do you know, why is that and how to fix this?
