MacBook Air Wifi works better when plugged in? <body> I have a late 2013 MacBook Air, and I've noticed that my WiFi connectivity seems to work much better when the laptop is plugged in, or when the laptop is at full battery.  I recently lost my WiFi due to construction, and I've been using my neighbors WiFi (I have permission to of course), however due to the fact that it's a house away, nothing but my most powerful WiFi enabled devices can connect. For instance, laptops can connect, but my first gen Roku and cell phone cannot maintain connections.  I've noticed that when my battery gets low (30%ish) the WiFi seems to have problems loaded video streams and web pages, but when the laptop is plugged in, or at full battery, the WiFi works flawlessly!  What could be the reason for this?  <comment304091> Have a look at this question[Power Line Adapter (PLA) network reducing Macbook Pro's battery life](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/246391/119271).  While it's geared toward Ethernet and Power Line Adapters, it answers your question about WiFi. <comment304096> So do Apple products lower hardware performance when the battery gets low? Is suppose it would make sense that the WiFi card would draw less power when the battery is low, but is there any way to maintain full performance? Something akin to the "Power Modes" on Windows?
