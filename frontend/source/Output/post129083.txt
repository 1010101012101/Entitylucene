Displaying weather in notification center <body> I was wondering how can i display the weather of a particular city of my choosing in the Notification center? I'm using an iPhone 5S with iOS 7.1  Right now it only shows the weather using the Location service. When i turn off the location service for the weather app, it doesnt show any weather at all in the notification center, although i have added the city in the weather app?  <comment151112> so this did not work for you http://www.wikihow.com/Set-a-Default-City-for-the-Weather-Application-on-iPhone <comment151114> @Buscarì›ƒ nope, tried it earlier. It doesnt show anything regarding weather in the notification center using this method =(
