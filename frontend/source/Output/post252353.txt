where can I adjust emoji suggestions in iOS10 <body> I want to adjust emoji suggestions in iOS 10, like what car is suggested after typing "car" in a message. Or how can I add word-emoji links?  Thanks in advance  <comment314252> Did you try adding more word to the message (i.e. "Red car" instead of "car") or using "sedan" or "formula one" to be more specific? <comment314564> if I type car, it shows already a red car, but I thought that there may be a list of all links words-emoji. In iMessage, you can write a text and before send, you open emoji keyboard, all possible word-emoji replacements will be shown in a yellow/orange font color. by simple touching these, the word is replaced by an emoji :)
