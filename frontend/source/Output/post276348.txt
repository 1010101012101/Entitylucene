Update to macOS Sierra problem <body> I am trying to upgrade my OS X El Capitan to macOS Sierra. But whenever I download, right after 4GB+ download it resets from zero and starts downloading again. it has been days since I am trying.   Is there anyway, I can download the upgrade manually? I tried to download from the site, but it always opens iTunes and same thing happens.  <comment347882> Welcome to Ask Different. Unfortunately, your question as it currently reads doesn't provide enough detail for us to help you. Can you please edit your question to add info such as: (1) How are you trying to download the upgrade? (2) When you say _tried to download from the site_, what site? (3) When you say _it always opens iTunes_, do you actually mean iTunes, or the Mac App Store app? (4) Finally, it may also be worth also adding the exact model and configuration of your Mac. Hopefully we can get you sorted soon! :)
