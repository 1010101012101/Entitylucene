wired mode magic keyboard: turn bluetooth off <body> Is it possible to turn bluetooth off when connecting Apple magic keyboard over lightning cable? I would like to use it in wired mode and don't want to empty and charge the battery all the time. Furthermore it would reduce electric smog. Thank you.  <answer246338> Yes it works well when connected via lightning cable only with bluetooth disabled or enabled. I just tested it. :)  Btw, the keyboard lasts about 3-4months with every day typing.. 5min charge can last you hours. The Magic keyboard's battery last very very longer than previous edition.
