Is it possible to install Mac OS 9 on a VM? <body> Recently I got hold of a Mac OS 9.2.1 retail CD and would like to test drive it in a VM.  Is that possible?  <answer64963> SheepShaver will be your best bet. There's several tutorials laying around on getting OS 9 running in SheepShaver.  <answer64975> All OS 9 capable machines run on the PowerPC platform, meaning that your VM software has to emulate that instead of the x86 platform.  These are pretty rare.  I know only of qemu which can emulate multiple platforms, and it is mostly suited for technicians.  I would go for a dedicated OS 9 emulator as suggested by https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/64963/3157  <answer115402> Sheepshaver only runs 9.0.4  therefor Mac OS 9.2.1 will not work. because sheepshaver can only emulate a Macintosh 9600. Not a Power Mac G4 or G3 iMac or even a G3 Powermac   <answer135807> it would not work in vmware/virtulbox but it would work in qemu manager  <comment135076> Welcome to Ask Different!
