How do I batch convert a bunch of pngs or other images into a single PDF on Mavericks? <body> I took a bunch of screenshots and I want to make them pages in a single PDF. Selecting all four in Preview and exporting to PDF only exports two (?), separately. The "Export to PDF" File menu function adds a strange white border around the screenshots (and orients the page as portrait). So I converted each to PDFs individually and then combined them manually. I tried the solutions here, but Mavericks' Preview doesn't appear to work that way anymore. What's the best, free, hopefully built-in way to automate this?  <answer107982> You can use the codeconvert/code command if you install strongImageMagick/strong. ImageMagick isn't always a simple install, but if you install Xcode and Homebrew it should be fairly painless.  codeconvert *.png foobar.pdf/code  http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php  <answer107992> There is an Automator action - strongNew PDF from images/strong. It creates a single multi-page document from input images. You can create a workflow or app that would process your images that you drop onto it.  If I create an application in Automator with that single action, I can drop my images onto it, and it'll create a PDF with one page per image.
