Terminal command to bring up shutdown dialog? <body> I know how to shutdown a Mac from Terminal, but is there a way to actually bring up the shutdown dialog you get from Apple → Shut Down…?  <answer104087> You can create an Automator script that you can later run from the command line with "open".  You could "Record" in Automator. I guess that would be the easy way, but there might be other problems. Because when you record, Automator actually records mouse pointer movements…  <answer104094> This should work:  Applescript:  precode-- Open  Shut Down Dialog... -- Save this text as file named shutdown.scpt tell application "System Events"     set uiScript to click menu bar item "Apple" of menu bar 1 of application process "Finder"     set uiScript to click menu item "Shut Down…" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Apple" of menu bar 1 of application process "Finder" end tell /code/pre  You can run it from Terminal like:  precodeosascript shutdown.scpt /code/pre  <answer104117> You can send codeloginwindow/code the codekAEShowShutdownDialog/code Apple event:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "loginwindow" to «event aevtrsdn»' /code/pre  The four letter codes for Apple events are listed in codeAERegistry.h/code.
