iPhone iOS 9.3.5 thinks it's disconnected from the Internet when attempting to browse IPv6 URL <body> When I enter strong[xxxx:yyyy:zzzz:qqqq:d46b:9603:dbcf:48df]:82/strong (redacted, as this is my home server's IP address) into the URL field on Safari I get the response:  emSafari cannot open the page because your iPhone is not connected to the Internet./em  I get a similar message when using Chrome on the iPhone.  The iPhone is most definitely connected to the Internet.  I can browse other websites with no problem at all when using the site's domain name.  The problem is only when I specify the IPv6 address instead of the domain name.  I have WiFi turned off, so I'm using cellular data.  Why does the iPhone think there's no Internet connection?  <comment321263> What's the cell-service carrier? <comment321270> The cellular carrier is AT&T. <comment321295> Well, that's most likely your problem. First, your iPhone needs IPv6 connectivity, and AT&T isn't quite done rolling that out.
