How to get gmail contacts on my iphone? <body> Under the 'settings' - 'mail contacts calendars' - gmail  there is no option to sync the contacts  what's the workaround?  <answer79964> If You are using Mac OS X, you can synchronize you Contacts on Mac with google (set it i Contacts settings). Then just synchronize with your iPhone via iTunes.  <answer79966> ol liOpen settings/li liTap Mail, Contacts, Calendars. /li liTap Add Account, /li liTap Other, /li liTap Add CardDAV account. /li liEnter google.com for the server, and your login info./li liTap Done. /li /ol  This will bring your Google contacts in, and it is smart enough to show you a unified view of your Google contacts with your Apple ones.
