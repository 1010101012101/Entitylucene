How do I get EyeTV to work on my 2007 iMac? <body> I'm running a 2007 24" iMac, and recently installed OS X Lion.  I am trying to use the EyeTV software for my Elgato TV tuner.  When I run the program, Console logs messages of the form:  precodeautomountd[14168]: parse_entry: bad key in map auto_home: EyeTV Archive /code/pre  and the program crashes.  I have a vague understanding of what autofs is, but I have no idea why it is being invoked.  I looked up Apple's autofs source code and it seems that "EyeTV Archive" is being passed in as a key to something, somewhere (like I said, I know know much about autofs).  Can somebody help, please?  <answer26460> My best guess is that you have an unmounted volume set in the EyeTV settings under emRecording/em / em"EyeTV Archive" Location/em.   <answer29799> Try deleting any Library folders used by EyeTV before running the app. This has solved different issues that I have had with EyeTV in the past. Hope this helps.
