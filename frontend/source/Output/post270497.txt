How to create additional /dev/tty.usbmodemFA* so that mouse will not freeze? <body> I'm using Zterm (also tried: screen, Coolterm) to connect to serial-over-USB (to receive data from microcontroller, sent via UART). The problem is that when I select "usbmodemFA133" in Zterm's settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/upkN5.png" alt="Zterm configuration"  then although I receive correct data from microcontroller, then at the same time strongmouse gets blocked/strong and I can barely use the computer.  Looks like the microcontroller and mouse share some USB resource. That's weird because the devices are at different ports, no USB hub is used. What can I do? Is there some way to separate the devices?
