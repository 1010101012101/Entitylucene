OS X prompts for password when connecting unencrypted volume and Disk Utility repair does not work <body> I have an external 250 GB SSD which now, when I connect it (via USB) to the computer, causes the OS (10.10.3) to prompt me with:     Enter a password to unlock the disk   The problem (well, ema/em problem) is that the disk is not encrypted with FileVault. It does have an codeencfs/code filesystem on it, but that's in addition to regular non-encrypted files. So I don't know the password because there isn't one. (The encfs password does not work, when entered.)  Running Disk Utility's "repair volume" on the partition in question tells me that the journal needs to be replayed but the volume is read-only.  Is there a way for me to at least mount the filesystem read-only, ignoring the journal and taking my chances? I would of course ideally just like to repair the volume, so if that's an option then I'd love that.

I addded gpt output for /dev/disk2 since /dev/disk1 seems to still be a placeholder for the ejected aurex volume. I didn't know about either of those commands before! <comment228247> @Jeremy Which of the two encfs implementations did you install? [EncFS](https://vgough.github.io/encfs/) or [EncFSMP](http://sourceforge.net/projects/encfsmp/files/) <comment228249> I have encfs installed via brew, which looks to be the former.
