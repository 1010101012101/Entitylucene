How to enable push notifications of emails? <body> A quick question with perhaps no answer,  How can I enable push notifications of emails?  What currently happens when I get an email is that my phone vibrates or rings, then I look at the locked screen and no information is displayed.  I'd like a preview of the email in a notification window with at least the sender.  I currently have 3 mailboxes, one in google, one in hotmail, the other a private work exchange server.  Is there a solution to receive push notifications for all of my mailboxes?  <answer53054> You're talking about the notification settings for Mail, not whether push is on. To see new mail messages in the Lock Screen:   Settings  Notifications  Mail  Make sure "View in Lock Screen" is turned ON.   If you're concerned about your mail's push settings, those are in:  Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendar  Fetch New Data  Make sure "Push" is set how you want it.   <answer139519> There is no push for mail settings for iPhone 5  <comment164484> Welcome to Ask Different!
