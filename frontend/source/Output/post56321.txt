Markdown to .doc or .rtf <body> I'm interested in using a variation of Markdown for my work, but my target format is Word files (this is what my clients use, it's non-negotiable). Most implementations of Markdown would leave me with a circuitous route at best to get a Word file.  Perhaps more importantly, I'd want to be able to format things like footnotes/endnotes, which don't have any representation in Markdown or Multimarkdown, as far as I know.  Is there anything like this out there? Basically a flavor of Markdown oriented toward print rather than the screen?  <answer56330> John Gruber, one of the two inventors of Markdown, uses footnotes fairly extensively on Daring Fireball; to see his raw (pre-Markdown) formatting, append code.text/code to one of his urls, like this: http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/this_ipad_mini_thing.text.  As far as converting Markdown to RTF, codetextutil/code is your friend. You can pipe the output of the codeMarkdown.pl/code command to codetextutil/code like so:  precode/usr/local/bin/Markdown.pl | /usr/bin/textutil -stdin -stdout -format html -convert rtf | pbcopy # or whatever else you want to do with it /code/pre  Instead of piping to pbcopy (which puts the rich text on the clipboard), you could code&gt;/code it to a .rtf file, or whatever else your workflow dictates.  <answer56381> You can also use pandoc:  precodepandoc -f markdown -t docx file.md -o file.docx /code/pre  One advantage compared to codetextutil/code is that the output uses paragraph styles. You can also use styles from an existing file with code--reference-docx file.docx/code.  <answer100757> iA Writer offers formatted Word (.docx) to Markdown import and export: iAWriter.com  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HC3E2.png" alt="Word to Markdown Import and Export"  <comment65396> `textutil` is handy! <comment368049> Download page for Markdown.pl : [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
