change metadata tag before importing mp4 into iTunes to Music Video <body> I am a DJ and use record pools to download music and music videos. This is a legal source of mp3 and mp4 of music singles remixed/edited from the album version.   My current workflow is:  ol liHazel will find mp3s that have not been matched before, open in Metadatics app and add a color tag./li liKeyboard maestro when it detects Metadatics is open and execute macros emulating keystrokes to codeselect all/code then codestrip all artwork/code then codesave all/code and finally codequit/code metadatics./li liHazel will search for mp3s with color tag that are more than 30 minutes old and import into iTunes./li /ol  I want to run a similar workflow with mp4 that will   ol limatch mp4s that codecontain/code source/URL of the record pool URL.  /li listrip artwork/li listrongchange metadata so mp4 is imported as codeMusic Video/code/strong/li /ol  TL;DR  what is the metadata tag to make a mp4 imported into iTunes as Music Video?  <answer287671> If I recall correctly, music videos have the following metadata:  ul listronggenre:/strong Music Video/li listrongmedia kind/strong Music Video/li listrongkind/strong Purchased MPEG-4 video file/li /ul  As a minimum, I imagine you'd have to change the codegenre/code and codemedia kind/code metadata so that they're labelled as codeMusic Video/code to ensure the .mp4 files are imported as music videos.   As an aside, you can typically view the above metadata within iTunes by doing a Get Info. That is, select the item and press kbdcommand/kbd kbdI/kbd (or you can go to iTunes  Edit  Get Info). This brings up all the metadata and you can view the:  ul listronggenre/strong within the strongDetails/strong tab/li listrongmedia kind/strong within the strongOptions/strong tab/li listrongkind/strong within the strongFile/strong tab/li /ul  <comment363244> yes, I know I can change/edit the MP4 file directly in iTunes. However, I would like to change the metadata so that it imports into iTunes directly as a `Music Video`. not having to manually change each or a group of `Home Videos` <comment363261> Yep, I understood what you wanted to do with your workflow. What I meant by my answer was that the metadata you'd need to change, as a minimum, is the `genre` and `media kind` and that you'd need to change these to `Music Video` so that the .mp4 files are imported as music videos. I've updated my answer to clarify this.  If I've misunderstood your question altogether, let me know.
