Can't exec "glibtoolize": No such file or directory <body> I have a shell script codeautogen.sh/code, I run it under my project directory in terminal:  precode./autogen.sh  /code/pre  I get error:     Can't exec "glibtoolize": No such file or directory at   /usr/local/Cellar/autoconf/2.69/share/autoconf/Autom4te/FileUtils.pm   line 345,  line 4.   Then, seems it can not find glibtoolize, so I tried to figure out where is my glibtoolize. Eventually, I find it is in this path:  precode/usr/local/Cellar/libtool/2.4.2/bin/glibtoolize /code/pre  Then, I get stuck, how to solve my problem after I found my glibtoolize?  <answer108514> Looks like you already have codelibtool/code installed via codebrew/code but it is not linked so the required symlinks in code/usr/local/bin/code are still missing. To create them,  precodebrew link libtool /code/pre  <answer153213> I had the same problem after adding glibtoolize to the PATH variable it worked.  precodePATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/libtool/2.4.2/bin export PATH /code/pre  <comment180346> This just sets the path, which doesn't link anything. <comment180349> Also, you do not set a path to a specific file in bash. What you would do is set `PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/libtool/2.4.2/bin` but that is still problematic because that method only sets one path to one thing in `$PATH` which is not ideal. <comment180585> Ja, that is true, I changed my answer. In any case this solved my problem, as brew somehow did not make glibtoolize globally available.
