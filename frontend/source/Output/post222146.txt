Unable to send emails from iPhone 6 <body> I have an iPhone 6, an iPad version 9.2 and an iMac 14,2 and have no problems getting emails on all devices, but am unable to send emails from the iPhone. I do not have a contract for email services on either the iPhone or iPad, but use just Wi- Fi to connect to the internet. Anyone know why I can not send emails from my iPhone, while i can from the iPad?  <comment269113> What is your mail configuration on your iPhone ? Does it differs from your iPad ? Check the SMTP settings. <comment269117> Primary Server is mail.spiral77.com and the Host is a US firm that we used to establish a website some years back. We live in Switzerland. iPad has the same settings. Thanx
