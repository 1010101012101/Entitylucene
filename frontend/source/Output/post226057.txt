What's the opposite of "stop evaluating rules" in Mail.app? <body> I'm using Apple computers for a really long time now. One thing I never understood how to use "stop evaluating rules" in Mail.app. As far as I understand it, this action stops all subsequent rules, which is good. However, I often find myself that I do want to do the opposite where subsequent rules will run, depending on the rules before. As it is right now, you have to build one "master" rule that handles all the tasks, instead of building a couple smaller ones that handle smaller tasks.   Right now I'm always searching for something harmless, like "mark as read" to make it continue evaluating rules. But why is there no such entry? Why can't we tell Mail.app to "continue evaluating rules"?  <comment274435> It will always continue evaluation down your Rule list, until it reaches the end or is told to stop.  If a message isn't filtered by any given rule, it will just pass down to the next one. I'm not quite sure I see the point, though, of having a rule whose task is to evaluate without performing. <comment274473> That's not a solution because the actions can't be empty, so there needs to be *something*. <comment274523> so what's the point of a rule that does nothing? <comment298794> Not doing nothing, just continue to the next rule. <comment299195> I really don't get what you're trying to do. If you don't tell it to stop, it will go on to the next rule. I have about 25 rules in my list with no issues at all.
