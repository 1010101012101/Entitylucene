Enabling The Emoji Keyboard in iOS 7? <body> Emoji emoticons can be be an enhancing feature of a text-based conversation. Whilst having an android smartphone  itâ€™s rather easy to add third-party emoji packs (due to the open source nature of android). iOS i believe is a more "closed" OS, things are emnot that easy/em (so i'm lead to believe).  However is there a hidden emoji feature within iOS 7 (without the need to jailbreak) that I can unleash on an iPhone 5/5S ?  <answer103890> ol liOpen the Settings app./li liTap on General./li liTap on International./li liTap on Keyboard./li liTap on Add New Keyboard./li liTap on Emoji./li /ol  To switch to it on the keyboard, tap the globe icon between code123/code and the microphone icon.  I'd say that's easier than downloading a third-party anything on Android.  Plus it was included already 2 years ago with iOS 5.  <comment165734> What if there is no emoji to click it's not appearing on my choices <comment165752> @wow something must be wrong with your OS.  Try a reset.
