What's a good PDF score reading app for iPad? <body> As a chorus and opera singer, I frequently download public-domain scores in PDF form and read them with my iPad. There is a built-in PDF reader on the iPad, and it is serviceable for music performance. But there are flaws:  ul liSome PDF files containing high-resolution scans of the score take a long time to display. The degree of lag is a function of how the PDF file was made. In some scores it seems like the page starts off blurry and comes into focus. /li liIt's difficult to jump to arbitrary points in the score (e.g. director says, "let's skip to page 166", those with books turn easily, I fumble fumble on the iPad)/li liIt's hard to add bookmarks to PDF files to correspond to rehearsal numbers, to speed up jumping to points in the score./li liThere's no way I know of to make annotations on the score during a rehearsal, even an "x" to say "review this later"./li /ul  A good PDF score-reading app for iPad would fix these problems:  ul liApp should read ahead in the PDF file, digesting the next couple of pages of the socre, so that when I turn to the next page it appears instantly -- for all PDF files, even those with high-resolution scanned images./li liEasy ways to jump to page numbers and rehearsal numbers quickly, while rehearsing./li liWays to add bookmarks to scores for rehearsal numbers/li liSome way of annotating the score. /li liI can think of many features which would make the app even better./li /ul  Can any of you recommend iPad apps which work well for you as PDF score readers?  <answer76784> h1forScore/h1  This is the app I use--it's extremely stable and has a fantastic feature set. Only $5, too. What initially drew me to it was how easy it is to get files into the app--you can download them from a URL, from your Dropbox, upload from iTunes, use a built-in store, take a picture of a physical score with your iPad's camera... There's also a neat feature to share scores with other iPads over Bluetooth--something I've on occasion done with my piano teacher.  I don't even use all of the many features, but it's an app designed specifically for PDF sheet music reading and performance, so here are some I know off the top of my head:  ul liLots of options for metadata, categorizing, and bookmarking exist./li liAnnotations are built-in and very easy to use./li liIt's got a handy "performance mode" that disables extra functions except for the page turns./li liIt can even make use of a Bluetooth foot switch accessory for page turning./li liYou can rearrange/duplicate/crop the pages of your PDF so you have a linear set of page turns to deal with cuts, repeats, and codas./li liYou can bind page turns to an audio track for rehearsal or performance purposes./li liBuilt-in metronome and pitch pipe for rehearsal purposes./li /ul  <comment89059> +1 For a bluetooth foot switch. It's really going to be the year of bluetooth LE as people figure out how to use iOS and interact with the physical world. <comment146661> I love ForScore. I've generally found it very full-featured and easy to work with for everything from leadsheets to book-length opera scores.
