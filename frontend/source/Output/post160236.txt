Slow network speed in Safari etc. when using Aidrop <body> It's quite remarkable that when I am sending files from my iPhonebr to my MacBook Pro over Airdrop that all network speed seems to go a lot slower.  iTunes Match tracks take up to 10s to load, same goes for almost every websitebr I try to load in Safari or Chrome.  Seems quite odd to me since this only occurs when Airdropping, I'm not havingbr this issue when I'm transferring files from a server to MacBook over SSH or FTP.
