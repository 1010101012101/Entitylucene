What does lsboxd process do on os x? <body> My firewall asked me for a connection from codelsboxd/code (module com.apple.ls.boxd, ) to one another computer in my network to the port codetcp 548/code. What does it do? I found that it is a part of sandbox technology of a OS X, but what is it more specifically? I found it in my codelaunchctl list/code output:  precodecom.apple.LaunchServices.lsboxd /code/pre  <answer99543> codelsboxd/code is part of the OS X Sandbox.  It allows communication between sandboxed applications.  codelsboxd/code is in the Launch Services API. It is the Launch Services Sandbox Daemon, which governs what apps can launch apps in the OS X sandbox. You can peruse the App Sandbox Guide for more information about sandboxing.  PDF: App Sandbox Design Guide  <answer175502> Isboxd behaves as spyware, because it is spyware. The fact that it is part of OS X does not "explain" or justify its spyware function. It snoops for more PERSONAL info about you, the MAC user - nothing new, I hope...  <answer175971> Go to System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  Calendars and uncheck the box next to the lsboxd  Why this part of XCode needs access to your Calendar, is a different story.  <comment117111> yep, but what does the lsbox do? (I already noticed, that it is a part of sandbox, but it is too general) <comment117113> Sorry, I realized now that you noted that. It allows communication between sandboxed applications. (I have a document on it, but I can't seem to locate it at the moment.) <comment117114> great! it would be nice if you could provide a link on that (maybe it is possible to find it for the name?) <comment117115> lsboxd is in the Launch Services API.

No interprocess communication going on then, is it? <comment206959> Could you cite why this is spyware? What information is "snooped" and to where it is sent?
