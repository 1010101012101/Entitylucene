Spotlight Search on Yosemite indexes and shows iTunesLibrary.h and other files with ".h" extension <body> I am running Yosemite on My MacBook Air.  Spotlight settings are as below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/erjut.png" alt="spotlight settings on yosemite"  Even though I have not selected any option, it still shows ".h" files in result. Check below image for reference.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ihvd.png" alt="enter image description here"  As seen in above image, there is iTunesLibrary.h file in search results.  How to stop Spotlight from indexing those ".h" files? and how to remove those ".h" files from search results?  <answer186821> Did you have Xcode installed at some point? Generally those files (which are related to software development) are only indexed if Xcode is installed and the corresponding "Developer" item in Spotlight preferences is enabled.  In any event, since Developer does not appear in your Spotlight preferences, you can try doing it the manual way, based on steps found here:  ol liOpen Terminal (Applications/Utilities folder)/li liEnter the following command and press kbdReturn/kbd. You will be prompted for an administrator password. Enter the password and press kbdReturn/kbd.  precodesudo plutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Spotlight.plist -o ~/Desktop/com.apple.Spotlight.plist /code/pre/li liOpen TextEdit./li liPress kbdCommand/kbd-kbd,/kbd to open the Preferences window./li liAt the top, under "Format", select "Plain text"./li liDrag com.apple.Spotlight.plist from your desktop onto the TextEdit icon on your Dock./li liPress kbdCommand/kbd-kbdF/kbd to search and type in codeSOURCE/code (in all uppercase like that). Press kbdReturn/kbd to search./li liIf it finds something that looks like this:  precode        &lt;dict&gt;             &lt;key&gt;enabled&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;true/&gt;             &lt;key&gt;name&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;SOURCE&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  Then change code&lt;true/&gt;/code to code&lt;false/&gt;/code. Save and close the document, quit TextEdit and skip to step 12./li liIf it did not find anything like that, copy that whole block (from code&lt;dict&gt;/code to code&lt;/dict&gt;/code)./li liSearch the document again for code&lt;key&gt;orderedItems&lt;/key&gt;/code. On the next line after that, it should say code&lt;array&gt;/code. Scroll down until you find code&lt;/array&gt;/code./li liClick to place your cursor at the beginning of that line and paste. If it now looks like code&lt;/dict&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;/code, click to place your cursor right after code&lt;/dict&gt;/code and press kbdReturn/kbd to put code&lt;/array&gt;/code on its own line. Save and close the document and quit TextEdit./li liBack in Terminal, enter the following command and press kbdReturn/kbd. You may be prompted for an administrator password. If so, enter the password and press kbdReturn/kbd.  precodesudo plutil -convert binary1 ~/Desktop/com.apple.Spotlight.plist -o ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Spotlight.plist /code/pre/li liPress and hold kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd and right-click on the Finder icon on your Dock. Select Relaunch from the menu./li /ol  <comment220768> I didn't install developer tools at all :( <comment220769> Well, somehow the setting to index them got turned on. <comment220810> Steps you mentioned didn't work so I am trying something else. <comment220811> I excluded from scanning following folder: /Library/Frameworks/iTunesLibrary.framework/ and somehow it worked.
