How to verify which wireless access point my iOS device is using? <body> In my house I have multiple wireless access points, all of which use the same SSID. I'd like to know which wireless AP my iPhone is currently connected to.   On my MacBook I use the WiFi Explorer app to view available wifi networks and verify which wireless AP the MacBook is currently connected to - the app lists the Vendor name (eg Netgear, TP-Link) beside the SSID.  How can I verify which wireless access point my iOS device is connected to?   The standard iOS Wi-Fi menu only lists the SSID name, and since all APs have the same SSID this doesn't help.  <answer232813> As a workaround, you could log into the admin section for each AP and look at the active connection list.  <comment282978> (the same developer has a [WiFi Explorer for iOS](https://www.adriangranados.com/apps/ios-wifi-explorer) app, but this requires a jailbroken phone) <comment282991> I'm assuming you don't want to log into each AP and look at its connection list? <comment283001> @Hefewe1zen that's a good workaround, thanks. But ideally I'd prefer to do it from the iOS device <comment284427> @Hefewe1zen do you want to put that as an answer - it seems like the best option so far! <comment284678> sadly (and amazingly) this seems to be the best option <comment285496> In the case of the TP Link router, the [TP Link Tether](http://www.tp-link.com/common/Promos/App_Tether.html) software allows you to view the connection status of all devices from the phone, which makes things a bit easier
