Reinstall MacBook's OS X <body> I have a bit of a problem with MacBook Pro.  Currently it's running Mac OS X 10.8.3, but I want to install from DVD Mac OS X 10.5.2, which is for this MacBook Pro and was reinstalled few months back. I know it seems strange, but I just want to do it. Oddly enough it should make things easier for me. When I try to boot from DVD, then just a grey screen appears and nothing happens. Is there some sort of Apple's 'prevent tool' from downgrading your system?  I can format the HDD using GParted, but I want to make sure that he will boot from the install disc. Or maybe something else?  What should I do?  <comment104724> Are you sure that the 10.5 DVD belongs to this MacBook Pro? 10.8 only runs on MBP from 2009 or later, 2009 models should have come with 10.6 (or at least something higher than the .2 version of 10.5). <comment104725> Hmm, I can't be 100% sure. I got it at my firm for work and the person who have reinstalled it is quite certain he did it with this disk... The upgrade was done via AppStore, though. Don't know if that matters. <comment104726> You can check your model here: http://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/?search_keywords=%25s <comment104727> Looks like you are right. This should be installed with at least 10.6.3 OS X, eh... ;/ Well.. now I know what's what. Thanks for all the help.
