"device not configured" error when attempting to reach specific websites <body> A few months ago I posted the question getting &quot;out of memory&quot; error when trying to load specific websites (am not out of RAM) regarding bizarre codecould not allocate memory/code errors when I attempted to load certain specific websites (and was absolutely positively not out of memory), even though my internet connection was otherwise fine. That problem spontaneously vanished for a while, but now I'm experiencing the same behavior with a number of other sites and a different error message.   Attempting to load any of these sites in a browser gives me a generic codecould not connect/code message. When I try to ping them, I get this message:  precodeping: sendto: Device not configured Request timeout for icmp_seq 0  /code/pre  Things that haven't helped:  ul liUsing a different network/li liUsing a wired instead of wireless network/li liLogging in as a different user/li liRebooting (it actually did help on one occasion, but the problem reappeared a few minutes later)/li liRequesting different pages on the site or using variants on the URL (e.g., with or without codewww/code)/li liUsing the site's IP address instead of the name/li /ul  I haven't been able to determine whether the same problem occurs when I use a VPN, because one of the sites that will no longer load is my VPN :P  The error occurs before the computer has even tried to load the site, but after it receives the IP address.   strongupdate/strong: partial list of non-working sites (all of these are publicly available):  ul lihttp://users.humboldt.edu/li lihttp://vpn.ucsf.edu/li lihttp://cpx.sagepub.com//li lihttp://www.helioscalendar.com//li lihttp://www.ajcn.org/li /ul  <comment107325> Can you disclose any of the non working sites so we can try to recreate the problem. <comment107396> @Buscarì›ƒ Thanks for the suggestion; I've added a list. <comment107399> Great, so the San Francisco opens fine at log in screen, in Firefox. The Helioscalender also works. It does have a application/x-shockwave-flash in it that might cause your problem. <comment107402> And they all work in Chrome! <comment107403> It doesn't appear to even be trying to load the site. Also note that I get these anomalous error messages when I use ping, so I don't think it has to do with the content of their web pages. I've also verified that these sites respond to pings normally using a different computer.
