How do I uninstall a font? <body> I double-clicked a downloaded font and it installed itself in /Users/myuser/Library/Fonts. But all other fonts are installed in /Library/Fonts. Why does it do that by default and how do I uninstall it? I tried disabling and removing it via Font book but it still renders in a web project.    (I am running Mac OS 10.6.8)  <answer36506> Mac OS X places installed fonts in the user's Library folder to differentiate between system fonts (located in code/System/Library/Fonts/code), OS fonts (code/Library/Fonts/code) and user installed fonts (code/Users/~/Library/Fonts/code).  You can change this by open Font Book preferences (FilePreferences) and changing the "Default Install Location" option from User to Computer.   Hope this helps.  Added on 1/12/12 at 2:35pm:  Forgot to mention - If you're not able to delete the font from Font Book, try removing it from the code/Users/~/Library/Fonts/code directory and emptying the trash. Also, make sure it's not a font that is also in the code/Library/Fonts/code directory (preinstalled).  <comment41522> Edited your question for readability. I hope I didn't change the meaning. I don't think I did, but lemme know if I did.
