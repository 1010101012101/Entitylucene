What are the recommended steps to take before selling an iPhone? <body> I "lost" my iPhone at work, could not find it anywhere. I reported it lost, and got another through the insurance. A month later, I found it hiding in a file in one my desk drawers. The phone is just less than a year old, in near new condition, and it seems a waste to discard it. What has to be done to be able to sell it to someone who needs a working phone?   <answer197928> In terms of privacy - unlink your AppleID account and just go to codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Reset/code. Clean everything (Reset All Settings &amp; Erease All Content and Settings) and you're ready to sell / give your phone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxGps.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment236726> Please change the title of your post because the current one is not related to the question you're asking.
