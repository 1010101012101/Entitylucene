Use shell wildcard OR with diskutil <body> I have the following terminal command, which matches volumes called A001R45R, A123R45R, etc.  precodediskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/*R45R /code/pre  But I also want it to match volumes called B001R4G5, B150R4G5, etc.  How can I use the OR expression in the wildcard?  I tried the following, but it doesn't work:  precode$ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/{*R45R,*R4G5} The third parameter does not appear to be "bootable" or "nonbootable" $ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/"{*R45R,*R4G5}" Unable to find disk for /Volumes/{*R45R,*R4G5} /code/pre  I'm using bash.  <answer171809> I figured out the answer myself.  Apparently the bash version in OS X supports square brackets, but not curly brackets.  Weird.  It's bash 3.2.53.  This command works:  precodediskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/*[R45R,R4G5] /code/pre  However, in this particular case, it's actually better to use a more specific command like this:  precodediskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/[A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9][R,L]??? /code/pre  It should be noted that if more than one volume matches this wildcard, the command will fail, because the wildcard expands to both filenames.  <comment201423> Do You have other volumes which contains `R4` in the middle of their name? If not You can use: `diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/*R4*` <comment201440> Your shell is doing the expansion here - you should clarify which shell you're using. <comment201466> Mateusz, that won't work for me.  These were just two examples, but I have others that don't share characters. I'm using bash.
