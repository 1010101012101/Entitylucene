Can you create shortcut in Lions Launchpad? <body> As it says in title. I want to add one for Eclipse, to have all in one place.  <answer30516> Assuming you still have the Launchpad icon on your dock try dropping the app you want to be added to Launchpad on it.  Haven't tried it myself, but I recall reading about it somewhere.  <comment35012> This works, but you won't be able to get rid of it normally (the X doesn't appear like it does for other apps). <comment35270> It works. Thank you.
