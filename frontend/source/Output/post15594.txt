Resizing/moving windows with keypress and mouse in Mac OS X <body> A few years ago I remember a friend using an application in Ubuntu that made window management extremely easy. If you wanted to move the active window, you would press a key and drag the window by clicking anywhere on the window. If you wanted to resize the active window (proportionally), you would press a key and turn the wheel. I think this is very intuitive way to resize and move a window.  Are there any free applications for Mac OS X that can utilize similar mechanics?   <answer15599> Afloat does moving and resizing as explained, and does more than that. I really loved this application.  <answer15601> Not exactly what you want but:  ul lizooming is build-in OS X. Go to System preferences - Mouse  and check "Zoom while scroll wheel while holding Controll". After this you can zoom any part of the screen with CTRL+scrollwheel. It is not an "window zoom" but screen zoom - but sometimes helpful./li /ul  <answer15621> Free:  ul liBetterTouchTool ul liPrimarily used for mapping actions to gestures/li /ul/li liAfloat ul liSIMBL plugin/li /ul/li /ul  Commercial:  ul liZooom2 ul liAllows using fn as a modifier/li liSnap to screen edges and other elements/li /ul/li liMondoMouse/li liFlexiglass ul liAlso other window management features, like split screen shortcuts/li /ul/li liBetterSnapTool/li liNuKit/li liHyperDock ul liAlso Aero snap like functionality/li /ul/li /ul  <comment16978> COOL. +1 for this app. Thanx. <comment16980> Already installed Afloat.
