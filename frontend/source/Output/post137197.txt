The same peace of js should be run after any web page I visit is loaded. How can I configure Safari for this?  <answer137221> Yes, Greasemonkey or "User scripts" were the ones that popularized this.  For one option on Mac/Safari, please see http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20718/greasekit  <comment162992> @nicael Do you want to configure your Safari in a way to run a piece of javascript code after each page you visit or are you developing web pages and want to make sure that a js function only runs after the page is loaded? <comment162993> @patrix I want to configure Safari to run a piece of javascript after each page I visit.
