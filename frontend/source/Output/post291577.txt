automate file text edits <body> I have an online website that I'd like to move to a new URL. Therefore I need to edit all website html files (100+ files) to update the URL links inside each file of this website.  I'm thinking of making an off-line copy of the website files to edit.  Is it possibile to use Automator OS X to - open each file in the website file folder - search inside the file content for a specific URL link (say "www.website.com") and change it to the new URL (say "www.website.com/old")?  Else, do I need to rely on a text editor + Automator to make this process?  Or, can it be done using a UNIX script that you run in the Terminal ?  Thanks for any advice on how to perform this process!  <answer291596> Assuming all files are in the same folder:  precodemkdir new for i in *.html; do     sed 's|website.com|website.com/old|g' "$i" &gt; "new/$i" done /code/pre  <answer291611> If you're commonly editing website file contents you should invest in an editor.  h2Sublime Text 2/h2  Drop the website onto the icon and it will build the project:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dE3wr.png" alt="enter image description here"  run kbdcmd/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdF/kbd and enter the replacement:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jI6c2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click the codeReplace/code button and verify the codeReplace/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CaT4d.png" alt="enter image description here"  It will open and change all the files:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YnvPY.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  h2BBEdit/h2  Is an excellent and robust application I primarily use to edit code.  Drag and drop the folder onto BBEdit and go to codeFile -&gt; Save Project/code and it will create a file named codefoobar.bbprojectd/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uoVS7.png" alt="enter image description here"  run kbdcmd/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdF/kbd and select the project with the replacement parameters:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NgqrF.png" alt="enter image description here"  It will prompt you after clicking codeReplace All/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E0VHf.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you are unsure on your changes select codeLeave Open/code because if you select codeSave to disk/code it is very hard to revert back.  hr  h2Perl/h2  There is already a codesed/code solution but you could also do the same with Perl:  precode# !/bin/bash  DIR="/Users/vader/desktop/test" NEW="$DIR/new"  if [ ! -e "$DIR/new" ]; then      mkdir -p new     echo "made folder new" else     echo "folder exists" fi  for htmlfile in $(ls "$DIR"/*.html); do     TEMPFILE="$htmlfile.$$"     htmlbase=$(basename $htmlfile)     echo "Working on "$htmlbase     perl -pe 's|www.website.com|www.website.com\/old|g' "$htmlfile" &gt; $TEMPFILE &amp;&amp; mv $TEMPFILE "$NEW/$htmlbase" done /code/pre  There are other editors out there but these are the two I primarily use.  You could also do this in pure AppleScript but you haven't shown any code and mentioned terminal so I made the above in Perl.  <comment368108> You can use `sed` in Terminal, but for a specific answer we would need to see an excerpt of one of the web pages showing the old and the new URL. <comment368135> I did something similar a while back but did it in BBEdit as it can find/replace across multiple files. In case you are interested in commercial ($) options. <comment369594> Did any of the solutions below help you?
