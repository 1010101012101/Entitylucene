How to auto-complete url in safari <body> Can someone tell me what is the keyboard shortcut for auto completing a URL in the safari address bar?   PS: Like in chrome or Firefox the keyboard shortcut is Control+return, Command+Return.  <answer178864> When the list of suggestions comes up use the up/down arrow keys to scroll through the options. Press Enter to accept the currently highlighted option.  <answer178878> kbdcommand/kbd+kbdreturn/kbd in Firefox is not really emautocompletion/em: it just adds code.com/code  From Keyboard shortcuts - Perform common Firefox tasks quickly: Miscellaneous  ul liComplete code.com/code Address: kbdcommand/kbd + kbdreturn/kbd/li liComplete code.net/code Address: kbdshift/kbd + kbdreturn/kbd/li liComplete code.org/code Address: kbdcommand/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdreturn/kbd/li /ul  Safari does not offer this feature.  With the down arrow you can choose either  ul lia suggestion from Google Search/li lior an entry from your browsing history and bookmarks/li /ul  <answer178880> If you start to type anywhere you've ever been [assuming you don't delete your history] it will start to present a list of the most-used/most common possibilities.br Hitting Enter will go to the top hit; otherwise arrow down.   Otherwise, if there's nothing useful in history to auto-complete &amp; you don't step down with the arrow keyâ€¦   If it thinks it's a url it will automatically try .com first [&amp; also it will test whether www. is needed, though that's less important these days]  If it can't completely figure out that what you're typing is a url it will send it to Google instead.  Based on my previous history, this is what happens as I slowly type 'apple.co.'  strongapple/strong - [I spend a lot of time on Ask Different] ;)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKJJL.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongapple.c/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPRVa.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongapple.co./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WOJ3.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, if I go off-piste &amp; type something it doesn't have a hit for, like strongapplez/strong, it will switch to Google  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pErCg.png" alt="enter image description here"  emBTW, I have a lot of the 'pretty' icons &amp; helpers switched off, in prefs./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QugoY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer272275> There IS a way - in Safari Version 10.0.3 at least.  Type a slash ("/") after the domain name. As in,  precodesemiconducted/&lt;enter&gt; /code/pre  will resolve to www.semiconducted.com  Voila!  <comment211881> if it presents a list of possibles, down arrow. <comment211897> Are you saying this is not possible in Safari? :) <comment211923> My work is such that everyday I visiti new sites, for references and most of them are not so popular enough that Safari can guess. (- 1, That should have been a comment.) <comment211926> Why a comment? Safari does not have a shortcut to add ".com". You asked for autocompletion and the answer is OK.
