Migrating Capture NX2 to a New MacBook Pro <body> I just got the new MacBook Pro (2017, running Sierra 10.12.6).  I am trying to transfer my Capture NX2 software from my 2013 MacBook Pro (also running Sierra 10.12.6).  If I simply redownload to install, the software says that it is incompatible.  A previous member wrote about this.  The solution some people found was to manually download the related Nikon files from the Library Folder of the Hard Drive.    I followed these instructions.  However, when I run the software, it asks for my license key.  When I put in my license key (I have double and triple checked it), it says that it is now invalid.    For the people that were able to migrate the software, how did you get your license keys to work?  Any suggestions on what to do here?  Thanks so much!
