App cellular settings lost when toggling Airplane mode <body> On iOS 8.4 on iPhone 5s, I noticed that if I set Cellular  App Store  Off, kill Setting app, then activate Airplane Mode, deactivate Airplane Mode, launch Settings, Cellular  App Store  is now On (Green).   Toggling Airplane mode flipped the setting.  This is true for a number of Apple apps.    Why does this happen and what can be done so that my preferences are retained when toggling Airplane mode?   <answer195285> The best solution to this would be to backup and reinstall the OS.  <comment232453> Can't repro - same OS, same phone. Try resetting it.
