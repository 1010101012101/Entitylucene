Can Finder delete a file directly and bypass moving it to the Trash? <body> Is it possible to emreally/em delete a file (ie, bypass the Trash) from Finder? Currently, when I want to reclaim space from a USB drive, I coderm/code files/folder from the Terminal, but I'd like to do it from the GUI (similar to Shift+Delete in Windows).  <answer43580> No - there's no shortcut for that, but there is a services menu to extend Finder, flexibly bending it to accommodate your wishes.  You'll want to define a service that calls a script to coderm/code or codesrm/code and bind the keyboard shortcut of your preference to the service.  Automator's built in help can assist with learning to make a service.  Also invaluable is the site http://www.macosxautomation.com/ which is made by the automation guru Sal Soghoian  <answer43581> h1Delete Immediately @ Github (free)/h1  ol liDownload the file codeDelete Immediately.service/code/li liMove the file to code~/Library/Services/code.

User Jolly Jimmy listed in a forum post:  precodetell application "Finder"     set theSelection to selection      if theSelection is {} then         beep         activate current application         display alert "No files are selected for deletion." message "Select one or more files to delete." as warning     else         activate current application         display alert "Delete item(s)?" message "The selected item(s) will be deleted immediately.

It's in the app store (not free).  It has an icon available for the dock and the toolbar, but best of all for me is you can add a button in Finder for drag and drop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9GZYo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer126493> Not a fully-GUI answer, but you can make the procedure much easier by using a Finder+Terminal+Drag'n'drop approach, i.e. given that you have a terminal window opened, and a non-overlapping Finder window:  ol litype coderm -rf/code in the terminal (with a trailing space)./li liDrag the required folder from Finder to the terminal window and press kbdEnter/kbd./li /ol  strongHint/strong: To remove the emcurrent/em folder in Finder, drag the strongblue icon/strong in the Finder's title bar. This will also work with text editor windows or any OSX app that has a normal title bar displaying the current path or file name.  strongHint2/strong: If you are dragging the file/folder from a window that overlaps the Terminal window, then drag the file to the Terminal's icon in the dock, wait until the Terminal windows are displayed and then continue dragging into the the one you need.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQM1p.png" alt="drag the blue icon"  <answer270310> I know the OP was about Lion, but in a newer version you can do that by pressing: kbd⌘ Command/kbdkbd⌥  Option/kbdkbd⌫ Delete/kbd  Tested on Sierra  <comment49521> This tool has been initiated by user @jtbandes! <comment49547> Nice to know about this. <comment49556> +1, thanks for sharing - a nice find! <comment49557> +1, good link to the automation site, a very helpful resource. <comment49571> Looks great, but unfortunately seems to be [broken in Lion](https://github.com/jtbandes/delete-immediately/issues/1) <comment49587> @DanielSerodio Under what circumstances does this occur? I haven't encountered this bug. <comment49758> I've recompiled the project and reinstalled the resulting `Delete Immediately.service` and it's working fine now. <comment50827> Wow! People are still using this? Great! :) <comment50858> @jtbandes Thanks, for making this software! <comment148198> This is basically muscle memory for me.  Any time I trash something (which I always use command+del) I immediately empty the trash using command+shift+del.  It's still two steps but it only takes a fraction of a second. <comment157716> How did you add the icon to the finder toolbar? I have Trash Without installed, but cannot find out how to add it to finder. <comment157753> See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21MXGpyaaD0. It's at the very beginning. In Finder, go to your Applications folder and drag the app to the Finder toolbar. <comment229446> In a more recent OS X versions there is a `Backspace` key instead of `Del` used. <comment238438> @TranslucentCloud, that's not correct; Apple hardware labels the key as kbdDelete/kbd, at least in U.S. English keyboards.  You may have been looking at a non-U.S.-English keyboard, or another maker's keyboard attached via USB. <comment240542> @whiskeychief, yes, I'm looking at some Logitech keyboard. <comment339732> Very nice.  Also works with the Services submenu under Path Finder, for those who use it.
