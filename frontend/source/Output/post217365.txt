Icons in Finder, Safari, Mail, and Dock are not visible <body> I booted my MacBook Pro a few days ago and some of the icons on my dock were not visible. I noticed that there were icons missing in Safari, Finder and Mail. I attach a screen-shot to make my issue more clear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/koHch.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer217390> Try Safe Booting once. It causes all caches(including icon caches) to be rebuilt.  Steps for Safe Boot here  ol liChoose Apple menu  Shut Down./li liAfter your Mac shuts down, wait 10 seconds, then press the power button./li liImmediately after you hear the startup tone, hold down the Shift key.br You should press the Shift key as soon as possible after you hear the startup tone, but not before./li liRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple logo and progress indicator.br To leave safe mode, restart your Mac again, but donâ€™t hold down any keys during startup./li /ol  <comment262946> Hello, i followed your advice but i still cannot see the icons. I downloaded a program that was meant to delete caches from my mac but that didn't fix my issue either.
