Time Capsule port forwarding not working? <body> I'm developing an app, and one of the requirements is to connect to a computer with the URL scheme:  precodehttp://ip/~username/file /code/pre  The problem, however, is that I can't connect to my Mac remotely.  Let's say my public IP is xx.xxx.xxx.xxx.  I have a Time Capsule setup as my router, and I enabled port forwarding for port code24001/code, mapping it to my computer's LAN IP, 10.0.1.10 (DHCP reservation).  So, I saved the settings in my Time Capsule, then attempted to connect like so:  precodehttp://xx.xxx.xxx.xxx:24001/~charlescarver/file /code/pre  That didn't work, so I tried just connecting the following way:  precodehttp://xx.xxx.xxx.xxx:24001 /code/pre  Which game me the iSafari can't connect to the server./i error.  I double checked the Time Capsule, then made sure my machine's firewall was turned off, and tried again: no luck.  Finally, I ran a Port Scan test in Network Utility, and it wasn't seeing port code24001/code as open at all.  So then I tried forwarding the port to a different computer, code10.0.1.100/code, which showed it as closed also.  What am I doing wrong, exactly?  <comment89905> You were elsewhere on the internet and not on the net served by the Time Capsule when you tried connecting? <comment89906> No, I was still on the TC's connection when attempting to connect.
