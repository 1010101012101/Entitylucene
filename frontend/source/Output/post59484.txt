Keyboard shortcut stopped working in Safari 6.0 <body> I've created a custom keyboard shortcut for entering and exiting fullscreen in the keyboard preferences menu.  This stopped working for Safari 6.0 after I upgraded to Mountain Lion. I had the beta version of Safari which I got from the developers' site before I upgraded and the keyboard shortcut worked on that one.  So, how do I get this keyboard shortcut to work with Safari again? (Hopefully there's a simple explanation instead of some Automator workaround)  <answer59510> ol liGo to System Preferences./li liClick on “Keyboard.” Navigate to Keyboard Shortcuts./li liSelect Application Shortcuts in the left pane and remove existing shortcuts for Safari, if any./li liAdd a shortcut by clicking the “+” button. In the Menu Title field, type “Enter Full Screen.” Remember, you have to type the exact title as it appears in Safari./li liAdd another shortcut and in the menu title field and type “Exit Full Screen” in the Menu Title field./li liMake sure there are no conflicts with the shortcut combination that you choose to use./li /ol  Hope this helps.  PS: Be careful of the space between “Full” and “Screen” in the menu title.  <comment68515> Have you tried removing the shortcut from Keyboard Preferences and then re-adding it? <comment68543> That's the setup I had. I was not aware of a conflict (since there really doesn't seem to be one) but changing from "ctrl + f" to " ctrl + cmd + f" fixes it. So, does "ctrl + f" do something undetectable on safari 6? (googling got me nothing) <comment68545> Using ctrl for keyboard shortcuts doesn’t work very well. There are usually escape characters assigned to these shortcuts. It’s very rare for an OS X shortcut to have only ctrl as a modifier key.
