Charger cable vs Lighting to USB Camera Adapter <body> My iPad came with the normal Lightning - USB Type A Male charger cable. I want to connect it to my Roland piano and the piano's manual mentions the need for a camera connection kit - so apparently I need this: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD821ZM/A/lightning-to-usb-camera-adapter  Now these cables (charger and the above adapter) look very similar to me (both have USB Type A at one end, although one is male and the other is female).  Do they have different wiring/chips?  <answer188783> Apple made the camera adapter for photo-transfer purposes. It brings nothing else.   There is no difference in terms of charging if you use the -normal- lightning to USB adapter.   So yeah, go with the charger cable.   <answer218087> Must be a chip inside. I can't find any info on this either.   <comment223735> "no difference in terms of charging" - I'm interested if there are differences in terms of data transfer. For what it's worth, I can't connect the iPad to the piano using the charger cable, but users on online forums claim they were able to connect these devices using the cable linked in my question. So there may be differences between those cables? <comment223741> What is the purpose of connecting your iPad to the piano ? <comment223790> For this app: http://www.roland.com/products/piano_partner/ (the piano is in the 'Compatible' list). <comment338887> I came here while searching for similar info. But one thing I can tell you is that the camera connection kit cable has female usb port unlike your charging cable which is male usb plug. I'm about to buy one to connect my RME UCX. What have you done finally?
