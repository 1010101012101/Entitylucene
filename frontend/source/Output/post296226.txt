How can I restart the text to speech feature? <body> I use the text to speech feature a lot. Sometimes, after I put the macbook to sleep and come back to it the feature no longer works. I would have to shutdown/restart the computer in order for the feature to work. Is there are a way to restart/enable text to speech without restarting the computer?  <comment374147> Try running Activity Monitor, search for the Process Name `coreaudiod`, and force quit it by clicking the X icon and selecting Force Quit. Speech Synthesis uses the `coreaudiod`daemon process for its [audio output](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/SpeechSynthesisProgrammingGuide/SpeechOverview/SpeechOverview.html): <comment374177> @IconDaemon that did it. The only problem now is that the keyboardshortcut is not working <comment374178> Which keyboard shortcut? Be specific. <comment374185> @IconDaemon Sorry, I have a shortcut set for text-to-speach (option + esc), not that does not work. <comment374248> Ah. This is set in the `System Preferences  Accessibility  Speech` sidebar. Is the checkbox checked in this setting? <comment374250> @IconDaemon Yes it is checked, but it doesn't work
