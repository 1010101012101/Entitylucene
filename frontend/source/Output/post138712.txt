iMac hard disk partially erased - now stuck <body> My iMac, about four years old, started playing up badly - went from being very slow to not doing anything (grey screen at start up). I tried resetting PRam without success, and then started up in safe mode to run Disk Utility.  Received a message saying that the hard disk couldn't be repaired, and would need to be reformatted. I have started this operation – clicked “Erase” in Disk Utility, and it gets partway through, and then gets stuck. I have tried this several times, and each time it freezes at about the same point.  The progress bar is about 40%, the message is:  precodenewfs_hfs: write (sector 573440): Invalid argument /code/pre  The whole thing is now frozen, and I can't do anything but turn it off by holding down the button at the back.  If anyone has any suggestions to move things further, I would be very grateful!
