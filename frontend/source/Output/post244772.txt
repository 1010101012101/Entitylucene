Apple TV - Remember Airplay speaker choice <body> We have our Apple TV 4 connected to a projector and we're using an Airplay speaker. Upon wake-up the Apple TV defaults to the physical audio output; we have to switch it to the Airplay speaker each time.  Is there a way to persist the Airplay speaker choice so that the Apple TV keeps using it upon wakeup/startup?  <comment301711> I've been investigating a similar issue and some insight appears to be that the ATV looks for a speaker connection before it looks for a network connection, thus defaulting to an internal speaker when it wakes. I've sent a bug report in to apple, but this has been an off and on problem since version 4 was released. <comment324282> Same problem here. Any news on your side, guys? Little issue, but totally ruins my user experience (and unfortunately seems very symptomatic in my growing list of Apple annoyances) <comment324338> I opened a radar with Apple and it was closed as a duplicate so Apple knows about this issue and will hopefully fix it in tvOS updates.
