‘The application "AppDownloadLauncher" is not open anymore’ when attempting to open Xcode <body> I have just downloaded Xcode off the App Store and now when I try to open it I get this error:     The application "AppDownloadLauncher" is not open anymore.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZpHq4.png" alt="Error message screenshot"  What does this mean and how do I open Xcode?  <answer284076> The process AppDownloadLauncher is used to launch apps from the Mac App Store. The error is shown when a problem occurred communicating with this process.  Use Activity Monitor to force quit AppDownloadLauncher, then try relaunching Xcode.br If this doesn't help, log out and back in.
