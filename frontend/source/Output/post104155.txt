How to uninstall Canon IJ Network Scanner? <body> I got rid of a Canon all-in-one printer/scanner, but how can I get rid of the codeCanon IJ Network Scanner/code (and other Canon softwares that might have been installed) on my Mac? It is not showing in codeApplications/code.   <answer104180> Additional Canon software is installed in code/Library/Printers/Canon/code. You can use kbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd in Finder to open a Finder window for that folder.  <answer104234> I would use a great mac app called App Cleaner, you just drag the icon to the window and it deletes all files associated with it.  https://www.google.com/#q=app+cleaner  <comment122700> It's highly unlikely an app cleaner will remove that printer support file. Have you run that tool on this type of program item or should this be removed as a "lmgtfy" type suggestion that doesn't really address the problem at hand.
