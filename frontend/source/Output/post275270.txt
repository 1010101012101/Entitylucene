Loginwindow tried to hijack service? <body> I was looking at my system.log for another issue I was trying to fix, and noticed after a reboot that I had a service hijack attempt, I then noticed that the process that was trying to hijack was called loginwindow.107. Below is the terminal output for relevant lines in system.log:  precodeNick@MacBook-Pro:/var/log$ cat system.log | grep loginwindow Mar  5 02:46:43 NicksMBP com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.user.loginwindow.107.4294967295): Service sets EnableTransactions=false and EnablePressuredExit=true, which makes no sense.
