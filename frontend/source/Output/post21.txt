Faster alternative to ShakesPeer? <body> I've used ShakesPeer for it's clean and Mac-like interface. But the downloads are really slow. Is there a faster alternative to ShakesPeer?  Preferably having at least the same features as ShakesPeer itself if not more. Also preferable if the software follows the Apple Human Interface Guidelines.  <answer36> I haven't tried these but Jucy and EiskaltDC++ are two DirectConnect clients that work on mac.  However, neither appears to use a mac interface.  source: http://alternativeto.net/desktop/shakespeer/?sort=likes&amp;platform=mac  <answer73> Whatever calavera pointed you at â€” also, try MLDonkey, NeoModus Direct Connect (DC original client!) and Valknut, they all have Mac versions.  Since I'm not a DC user, can't comment on speed =(  <comment8> Could you expand on the features for those not familiar with ShakesPeer? <comment12> Anything faster than ShakesPeer will do actually. It is about 10 times slower than anything else (on other platforms) that I've ever used. <comment15> Are they any faster? <comment18> someone else would have to comment on that... as I said I haven't tried them.  Just pointing you to some alternatives :)
