Zabbix agent installation <body> On the Zabbix website it says Mac OS X agent is supported, however, I do not see a download link available. Does anyone know how to install the agent on OS X?  Here is a link to the list of supported platforms: http://www.zabbix.com/requirements.php  And here's the link to the downloads: http://www.zabbix.com/download.php  There's no OS X option to download for pre-compiled agents.  <answer226074> I was disappointed too. According to zabbix, it isn't in their plan to distribute a binary agent for Mac. That's a shame. However, I found a post which describes how to do it yourself. Once compiled (once), you can deploy the agent executable to many machines... I yet have to try. http://bluepilltech.blogspot.lu/2015/02/how-to-compile-zabbix-agent-on-osx.html  <answer276882> Use these: https://github.com/mipmip/zabbix_agentd_osx_installer/releases  They are already compiled and they created a nice installer  <answer294808> Install Homebrew. (You should use this on MacOS for software installation anyways)  https://brew.sh/index_de.html  After installation do:  precodebrew install zabbix --without-server-proxy /code/pre  ..for a agent only installation or do:  precodebrew install zabbix /code/pre  ..for a full installation including server and proxy
