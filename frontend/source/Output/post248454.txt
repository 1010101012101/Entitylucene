Podcast Speed on iPhone <body> How do I slow the speed of podcasts on my iPhone?   I have looked through all of my settings and have searched all possibilities on the podcast itself. Voices are too fast to be understood. There is no trouble with the playback of music.  <answer248455> Yes - you can slow down podcasts by pressing the code1x/code button to the left of the rewind by 15 seconds button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h1I96l.png" alt="A podcast playing in iOS 10."  In the above screenshot I have pressed the code1x/code button until it has become codeÂ½ x/code button.  If the voices are "too fast to be understood," then you may have actually strongincreased the playback speed/strong (code2x/code or code3x/code), and may want it back at code1x/code. Either that or their voices are actually that fast and you will want to strongslow it down/strong.
