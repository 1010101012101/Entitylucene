Screensaver suddenly active <body> I've always opted to have my display turn off after emX/em amount of time in lieu of using a screensaver.  My screensaver preferences were set to strongcodeStart after: Never/code/strong. That is until today.  I walked into the room and noticed the screensaver running.  When I went to check the system preferences it was set to strongcode20 minutes/code/strong.  ul liI did not set it to 20 minutes./li liNo one else ever uses this computer/li liI haven't done any updates to my OS recently/li /ul  This strikes me as pretty odd.  Anyone have a possible explanation?  Might there be a historical record of when and how this change happened in a log somewhere?  I am running 10.11.3.  <comment282808> Have you tried a 'Repair Permissions'? <comment282820> @CousinCocaine - can you be more specific?  Are you suggesting that repairing permissions might have caused my preferences settings to change? <comment282825> Yep. Your permissions haven't changed after setting them. It might be due to file rights. <comment282851> but what would cause it to suddenly change to `20 minutes`?  I've had it on `Never` for years and it's never been touched and always worked as expected in the past.  The thing I'm trying to understand is what would cause my prefs to suddenly change?  I haven't done anything to the permissions. <comment283668> strange indeed. As if the settings are back to there default state. Sorry, but I have no clue why.
