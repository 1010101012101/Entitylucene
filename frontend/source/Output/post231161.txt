How best should I delete this user <body> I'm new to OSX and tried to create a user from the terminal which I no longer need and which I named incorrectly.  I see I can delete the user in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups but do I need to delete them from the terminal instead as this is where I created them?  If I delete them from the terminal what commands should I use?  Below are the commands I used to create the user:  precodesudo dscl . -create /Users/www-data UserShell /bin/bash sudo dscl . -create /Users/www-data RealName "Lucius Q. User" sudo dscl . -create /Users/www-data UniqueID "1010" sudo dscl . -create /Users/www-data PrimaryGroupID 80 sudo dscl . -create /Users/www-data NFSHomeDirectory /Users/www-data /code/pre  <answer231174> Have you tried codesudo dscl . -delete /Users/www-data/code ? You might also want to delete /Users/www-data with coderm -rf /Users/www-data/code.
