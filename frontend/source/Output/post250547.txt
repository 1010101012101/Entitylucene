How to remove the extra button space when having the terminal in full screen mode? <body> I just notice that when having the terminal in full screen mode, there is an extra space at the button. (see image)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRckC.png" alt="enter image description here" Terminal opened in full screen and vim opened.  Another example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z8GGj.png" alt="enter image description here" shell prompt.  Any idea of how to remove it so that I can take advantage of that space?  I am using using OS X El Capitan, 10.11.6 (15G31)  <comment311188> I can't tell what that picture is supposed to be telling me :/ <comment311203> Is the bottom left corner after opening vim, the row points to the extra space added when in full screen mode <comment311206> sorry, never used vim, you said Terminal. <comment311210> I took the snapshot while vim was opened to try to be more clear since the backgrounds are diferente and is more easy to notice, I will try to take another snapshot using plain shell
