Can Lion OSX Search in App's Contents <body> How can I configure Lion to search for files in the Contents of an .app?  <answer24484> I wouldn't think so, but I'll be happy to hear otherwise. It's quite easy from the command line, though:  precodefind /Applications/&lt;YOUR APP&gt;.app -type f | xargs strings | grep &lt;YOUR SEARCH TERM&gt; /code/pre  You can also search through the whole Applications folder with  precodefind /Applications -type f | xargs strings | grep &lt;YOUR SEARCH TERM&gt; /code/pre  This will take quite a while, as it actually searches through the files instead of using a cached index, like Spotlight does.  <answer24519> strongEasy Solution/strongbr For a free GUI solution, you could use EasyFind. To search inside applications, you just need to check "Package Contents" in the sidebar.  For a quicker search, you can limit the search to just the Applications folder by using the menu under the search field (on the far right).  strongCommand Line - Find/strongbr In Terminal, you can use the codefind/code command:  precodefind /Applications/foo.app -type f -name "bar" /code/pre  Replace codefoo.app/code with the name of your app, and replace code"bar"/code with the name of the file you want to search for.   If you want to search all apps in /Applications, leave out the code/foo.app/code part of the command.  If you want to include folders, remove code-type f/code, if you want to search emonly/em for folders, change code-type f/code to code-type d/code. You can also use the code*/code wildcard in your filename to get partially matching results.  <answer24523> h2Find Any File/h2  is a third-party utility that can do this. It costs US $4.00 and can be downloaded from the developer or purchased in the Mac App Store. It is a good alternative to using the command-line tools that come with Lion. It can also be run as "root" to access even more files than what Mac OS X usually lets the user see.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aMRDu.png" alt="enter image description here"
