Create global shortcut to run command line applications <body> What steps do I need to run a command line program via a global shortcut?  I setup Automator to create a new Run Shell Script and tried to assign a shortcut in System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts, but nothing happened.  <answer24094> Applescript it:  precodedo shell script "ls ~/Desktop" /code/pre  Add what you want there, then you can run the Applescript via a global hot key application. I would recommend Spark  Oh, and I don't know about assigning an shortcut through System Preferences  <answer28188> It appears as though this was available in 10.6, (see http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090903085255430) but something broke in 10.7.2 (and possibly earlier 10.7)  I have found though that the Services keyboard shortcut emis/em honoured when System Preferences is at the forefront, but not in any other application, including Finder.  However, the earlier suggestion to use Spark worked perfectly in lion, except that I couldn't use Ctrl in my keyboard shortcut. (not a showstopper!)  <answer28272> FastScripts includes all scripts in ~/Library/Scripts/, so you don't have to add files manually. It also supports application-specific scripts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cOXey.png" alt=""  Other applications that can be used to assign shortcuts for running scripts:  ul liAlfred/li liApptivate/li liBetterTouchTool/li liButler/li liCockpit/li liController Mate/li liiKey/li liKeyboard Maestro/li liNuKit (only AppleScript)/li liQuicKeys/li liQuicksilver/li liShortcuts (only AppleScript)/li liSpark/li liThisService/li /ul  You can also create an Automator service:  ol liOpen Automator and choose the Service template/li liAdd a Run Shell Script or Run AppleScript action/li liCheck that the input type and application scope are correct/li liPaste the script and save the service/li liAssign a shortcut in the Keyboard preference pane/li /ol  There's a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 where the shortcuts for services don't always work until the services menu has been shown from the menu bar. Shortcuts for services don't work when the frontmost application doesn't have a menu bar or a services menu. There's also a short delay before services are run.  <answer40887> Without knowing the specifics of what you are looking for, I'd suggest creating a new strongService/strong through strongAutomator/strong. Services can be bound to keystroke triggers, and can execute shell scripts (among other things). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X9ORL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer40912> Quicksilver can be used to bind hotkeys to actions.      If you find yourself doing something frequently, you can speed up the task even more by assigning a “trigger” to it. Triggers can be activated by keyboard shortcuts or mouse movements   If it's a Unix command or shell script you want to execute, this Stackoverflow post gives some more information on using Quicksilver's "Terminal module".  <answer245614> I tried all those options, but they're too complex and unreliable or really expensive. So i ended up writing my own solution (open-source and free).  iCanHazShortcut  It can't do much right now, but that's a start. Feel free to contribute by adding feature requests and suggestions.  <comment26927> Bingo. Odd this functionality isn't already built into OSX. Thanks so much! <comment26935> @Adam Yeah, it is a little odd. <comment37976> only when the application menu is in focus.  If you click the desktop and tried the shortcut it doesnt work.  click on the menu for finder and then try it and it works.  I have a service for Terminal that has a shortcut and shows up on all apps...but it doesnt work if I'm not inside an app and even then the menu needs to have focus. <comment37977> plus one for mentioning other apps that do it as well.  I almost went to install spark when I already used QuickSilver.  I didnt know it had that option. <comment38019> @Lri even after loggin out and back in, restarted the machine, etc.  It still doesnt work unless I do as I described above. Setting it in Quicksilver works though.  I would like to know how come QuickSilver can catch those "global" shortcuts and not the OS. <comment46319> Except that it *is* built into OS X through Automator Services, @AdamFlott, it's just that the answer you accepted doesn't use that method. <comment46949> My question is different. I don't want a terminal window to open up at all. <comment46950> If you don't want a Terminal window to open at all, you are asking the same thing as the linked post. <comment86578> Also, AppleScript and Automator *are* part of OS X. <comment148653> also, the section in the "Keyboard preferences" pane to add a shortcut will be under the "Services" section, if using the Automator approach. <comment184582> Thanks for the hint pointing me to Spark - seems to be exactly what I was searching for! <comment184640> @FlorianLoch No problem! <comment244034> -1 for using 3rd parties without any good reasoning.
