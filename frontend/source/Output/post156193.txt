Telephone callback reminder <body> Yesterday my phone (iPhone 6 / iOS 8.1) alerted me to a reminder to call a phone number.  I did not set that reminder.  It somehow just appeared in the Reminders app.  Curious, I called the number.  It was NordicTrack's warranty renewal department.  The gal that answered the phone addressed me by name without me telling her. I have a treadmill and they wanted $100.  I did not delete the reminder.  It is still on my phone.br [ I also run Yosemite on my MBP and the reminder appears there as well ]  Anyhow - how did they add a reminder to my phone?  More importantly - how do I keep people from doing this in the future?
