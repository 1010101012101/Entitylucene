Connecting two devices to one phone <body> So I have been trying to connect my microphone to my iPhone 5s while connecting another device(a speaker) simultaneously. Is this possible in anyway? Also can I speak on the mic and hear from the speaker when I'm on a phone call. I know we have car headsets and car hands free speakers with built-in mic these days but I was just wondering if it's possible to use two different devices sinultaneously for a phone call.  <answer242182> Yes you can do this by buying a bluetooth speaker and a pluggable microphone. I would recommend using Ultra Slim Bluetooth Speaker from https://goo.gl/AXwXwn as the bluetooth speaker (it is available for $50, pretty affordable). And I would recommend using Zoom iQ7 from https://goo.gl/1dcUkj as your microphone ($99.99). But in Zoom iQ7 there is a headphone plug so you might not even need the speaker if you have Zoom iQ7.
