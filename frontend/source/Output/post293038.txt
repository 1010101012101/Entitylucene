Unable to boot from APFS Volume <body> Today i installed 10.13 Beta 4 in my system. Installation went well. After rebooting i pressed CMD + R to get inside recovery mode.   And followed the steps to convert into APFS. After the conversion i booted back and pressed ALT key and it listed the volume.  I logged into the 10.13 APFS system and started working. To make it as a start up disk, i opened System Preference -- start up disk and then chose 10.13 APFS volume to the start up disk   precodeRunning bless to place boot files failed. /code/pre  I got this error. Once i rebooted the system, I am not seeing the partition name by pressing ALT key.   Can someone help me with the steps to make this partition as bootable ?  <comment369724> Can you boot to the 10.13b4 system without pressing the alt-key? Do you have a dual-boot system (i.e 10.12.6 & 10.13.0b4)? <comment374215> I'm running into the same problem with 10.13 Beta 7. Yes I have dual-boot, both is APFS 10.13 Beta 7
