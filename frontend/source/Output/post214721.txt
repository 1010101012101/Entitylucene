How can I test all archives files in a folder to verify if they are corrupted or not? <body> I have a folder that contains many files, including some code.zip/code, code.tar/code, code.tgz/code, code7z/code, and codegz/code files. How can I test all archive files in this folder to verify if they are corrupted or not?  The folder contains subfolders, which also contain archive files that I want to check. I use Mac OS X 10.10.  On Microsoft Windows I use some file manager to list all archives:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yhCVf.png" alt="enter image description here"  then use 7zip to test all archives at once:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFH17.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment284545> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment284546> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
