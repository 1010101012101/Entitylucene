How to install CPAN modules from the command line on OS X? <body> Simple question: How to install CPAN modules on OS-X like normal Linux/Unix way?  I just want to type in codecpan/code something like codeinstall Perl6::Say/code for example.  <answer75265> Open the strong/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/strong and you have a unix prompt.  Both codeperl/code and codecpan/code ship with OS X so you have nothing to install unless you want a different version of them than ships with your particular version and build of OS X.  precodeAir:~ me$ cpan install Perl6::Say Sorry, we have to rerun the configuration dialog for CPAN.pm due to some missing parameters...  Will write to  &lt;&lt;/Users/me/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm&gt;&gt; /code/pre  <answer75269> You might be interested in perlbrew to manage local perl installations and cpan modules without interfering with perl included with the system or needing to use codesudo/code to install cpan modules.   <comment87400> Depending on the modules you want to install you may need to [install Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) as well so a compiler is available. Install Xcode before running `cpan` for the first time. If you've already configured `cpan` you may need to re-run it with `cpan config` so it picks up the compiler. <comment87401> i'm trying, but always have status 'make or install: NO'. am i need to use `sudo`? but i want only for current user, not root all modules <comment87404> Why not ask a follow on question. List exactly the module you want to install and exactly the error message you get. You may be missing the command line tools that Xcode can install or you may have another error. We like narrow, specific, answerable questions here. It's free to ask another question, so why not leave this as a signpost for how to get started and ask another on how to interpret a specific error message. I'll edit my answer to show that with Xcode and the command line tools installed, this works for a user install. <comment87405> This is a very nice solution for someone that cares not to install Xcode or other command line tools. <comment87406> good solution, thanks!
