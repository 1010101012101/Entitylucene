Xcode 4 and Snow Leopard <body> This is the thing :  ul liI have Xcode 4.3 on my MacBook Pro (running Lion)/li liI am stuck with 4.0.2 on my iMac (running Snow Leopard)/li /ul  Given that I would really like to retain a SnowLeopard-running machine (for development purposes), is there any way I could get anything 4.1 or above, to run on my iMac?   <answer45656> If you have registered for the paid iOS developer program, you should be able to see Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard available in the iOS Dev Center.  Here's what I see from a paid account:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5VYr.png" alt="Xcode paid developer account"  Here's what I see from a non-paid account (there's no Xcode 4.x for Snow Leopard):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pj7VN.png" alt="Xcode non-paid developer account"  This also explains why Xcode is a paid download in the Snow Leopard App Store, but is free in the Lion App Store.  <answer45657> After logging into the mac dev center, the "OS X Lion" homepage has a link near the bottom "Additional Downloads" with the description "Find additional pre-release software, previous versions of Mac OS X, and hardware driver downloads in the Apple Developer Downloads site."  Clicking the View All Downloads link takes me to a list of 150 downloads, sorted by date, and a category search.  In the Developer Tools category, click the "next page" link until you get to strongXcode  for Snow Leopard/strong.  Note I found it in the Mac Dev Center, I didn't check the iOS Dev Center, though I suspect the download might be there as well.  <answer45660> If you don’t really need Xcode, but all you need are the Xcode command line tools, here’s how to install them on Snow Leopard.  Simply download the “Command Line Tools” package from Apple Developer (free account required; you can use your Apple ID). As of this writing, the package is named “Command Line Tools for Xcode - Late March 2012”. It’s a 171.70 MB disk image, which pales in contrast to the 4+ GB full Xcode download.  Note that, if you’ve already installed Xcode, you’ll want to uninstall it before installing the Command Line Tools.  Once you’ve downloaded the package, launch Terminal.app and type:  precodecd mkdir osx-gcc cd /Volumes/Command\ Line\ Tools cp -r * ~/osx-gcc  cd ~/osx-gcc mkdir pkg mv Command\ Line\ Tools.mpkg pkg/install.mpkg cd pkg xar -xvf install.mpkg /code/pre  Note: It’s important that you use codecp -r/code, rather than simply codecp/code; the former will copy all hidden installation files to the code~/osx-gcc/code directory. The codeCommand Line Tools.mpkg/code file is merely a 512 KB descriptor that contains the installation instructions; the actual packages are located in the hidden, aptly-named codePackages/code directory.  Next, open the codeDistribution/code file with your favorite text editor. I prefer TextMate (codemate Distribution/code), but you can use codevi/code, codeemacs/code, BBEdit, TextWrangler, or even TextEdit (codeopen -a TextEdit Distribution/code). On the tenth line, you should see the following:  precodevar majorOSVersion = '10.7'; /code/pre  This specifies the minimum operating system requirement — OS X 10.7 Lion, in this case. Change code'10.7'/code to code'10.6'/code, save the file, and close your text editor. You’ve now modified the package so that it will install successfully on Snow Leopard; the final step is to recreate the package file so that it can be read by the installer app:  precoderm install.mpkg xar -c . -vf ../install.mpkg cd .. open install.mpkg /code/pre  <comment52006> I am registered iOS and Mac developer, but I still cannot find any link for Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard (is it even supported? I am not 100% sure). All I found is for Lion. Any ideas or specific links to point me to? <comment52007> Have you paid the yearly $99 fee? <comment52008> Of course I have. http://itunes.apple.com/gr/artist/insili.co/id450339436?mt=12 <comment52009> That's REALLY REALLY weird. How is this : I am seeing the second page you posted... :-S <comment52010> I think there are separate Developer Programs for iOS and OS X, are you sure you've paid for the right one? <comment52011> OK, OK. I just figured out what was going wrong. Pretty stupid of me. You were 100% right. I was just logged in with the first-first username I was using (a tiny variation of it actually, too unnoticeable...) before being registered in the paid programs. (As for the Developer Programs, yep; they are separate; 99$/year each. I am registered for both of them, although I'm mainly a Mac developer.) Thanks A LOT! :-) <comment52012> Glad to hear it worked! <comment52014> Well, I'm using my MacBook for Lion-testing and my iMac for SnowLeopard-testing, so it's quite a relief I will now be able to get a little bit up-to-date with my iMac machine as well. Thanks again! :-) <comment88894> Is it possible that the command line tools for 10.6.8 are not longer available on the apple developer center?!?
