Hostname changes all the time from capital to not capital and back <body> my Macbook air is called Johannes-Air. But when I open the terminal sometimes it says Johannes-Air and sometimes johannes-air. Does anyone know why this happens and how to stop it?  <answer159219>    The local hostname (is set in the Sharing pane of System Preferences) check it at first.   Then if you go to the below path, you might find traces of both upper &amp; lower case hostname     remove one of them and reboot your system.     em/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist./em
