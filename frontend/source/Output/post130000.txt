How can I get the list of allowed users for Remote Management via Terminal? <body> I want to use a command line tool to get the list of allowed users for Remote Management (ARD). I was able to enable ARD using kickstart, but I'm having trouble finding how you get the information, not set it.  Is there a com.apple.Sharing or com.apple.ARD somewhere that I'm missing?  precodedefaults /Library/Preferences/com.apple.ARDAgent /code/pre  doesn't seem to give me the info I need.  Ok, did find  precodedefaults /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement /code/pre  but that only gave me whether all local users are allowed for ARD. That is useful, but I want a little bit more. Do I need to use dscl perhaps to find ARD groups?  <answer130002> I had a bit of a look at my Server and desktop Mac and it would seem that the permissions are stored in the local Open Directory database. The command codedscl . -list /Users dsAttrTypeNative:naprivs/code when run by an admin will give you a list of users who have emany/em privileges set for remote management.  <comment152249> Thanks, that's a good start. Does it really need to be run with admin privileges? It seemed to work for me either way. Not a big deal in this case, since other parts of my script need admin anyway. <comment152252> The man page implied it did, but I'm an admin everywhere so I couldn't test without. <comment153275> I've been using the script for several days now and that command doesn't require root. Also, the command you gave has already proven more useful for our needs. We caught a user that shouldn't have been admin but didn't show in the usual System Preferences GUIs.
