AppleScript variant of find(1) <body> How would I write the following as an AppleScript command without the use of bash scripting?  precodefind / -file foo.txt /code/pre  I might have the bash syntax wrong, but I want to search from the root of the drive for a specific filename.   I tried drawing multiple efforts from things around on the net, but I just need a simple "find" solution.   <answer110759> you could use find from inside the applescript  codeset result to (do shell script "find -name / filename.ext"/code  <answer110760> You definitively have the codefind/code syntax wrong here :-)   To search for a file across the builtin disk use  precodefind -x / -name filename.ext -print /code/pre  If you want to search across all disks (including USB drives etc) use  precodefind / -name filename.ext -print /code/pre  <answer110767> Finder has an codeentire contents/code command for listing all items in a directory tree:  precodetell application "Finder"     files of entire contents of (POSIX file "/usr/share/doc" as alias) where name is "bashref.html" end tell /code/pre  It will be really slow if you search in the root of the volume though. If you need to search for all files on the volume, you can use mdfind or locate:  precodedo shell script "mdfind -name bashref.html -onlyin /" /code/pre    precodedo shell script "locate bashref.html" /code/pre  <comment130529> I built upon your answer to use: `find /path/to/dir -name FileName.txt`  This does exactly what I needed. Eg - `find /Applications -name '1Password.app'` <comment130530> Even though the answer by patrix does what I wanted in perfect simplicity, I was after a totally AppleScript based solution. Your solution does precisely what I need.  Thank you!
