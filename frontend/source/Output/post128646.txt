Both of these can take quite a bit of RAM, especially the Windows VM and PS/IL when dealing with large images. I'd recommend getting the 8GB RAM version if you're planning to run all of these simultaneously and editing large or layered images. Also, the SSD might be a bit too small for two VMs, but this depends on what kind of VMs you run (Windows XP/7/8, Linux server or desktop, amount of applications you install etc.).  I'm running the same kind of software on my Air, but it's a i7, 8GB, 256GB SSD version, and I've had no trouble with it.  <comment150688> It is difficult to answer this question. Much will depend on how you use each application.
