As an indie developer, what do I put in the contact section of the "Agreements, Tax, and Banking" in iTunes connect? <body> Not quite sure if this is the place to ask but I'm trying to set up IAPs in my app so I need to fill out the paid contract first. I have no idea exactly emwho/em I'm supposed to put in my contact section.  I'm not a company, and I do not have any people that serve Senior Management, Financial, Technical, Legal, Marketing roles. I need to fill this section out to continue but am stumped as to what exactly I'm supposed to put here.  <answer283463> I just put myself. I'm a student and the sole person with any responsibility for the apps on the account, so I simply put myself. I had no issues with this.
