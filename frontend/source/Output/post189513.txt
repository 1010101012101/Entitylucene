How to display exact modified date/time in finder? <body> I want to display the exact modified date/time in Finder. How can I do this?  As you may know, it's displaying things like like "yesterday" or "today" or just a date. I want to see the time component too as that can be important in some situations.  Thanks  <answer189514> In Finder - View  Show View Options or kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd J /kbd   Uncheck "use relative dates"  <comment224808> That _option_ doesn't exist in OS X 10.8.x, do you know of a way?  Maybe a `defaults write` command? <comment224826> Sorry, no idea on 10.8 - you should put the OS in the question, to avoid guesswork [if it was your question, otherwise raise another, with specific info.]
