applescript: get answer and buttons of display dialog <body> How do I get both the answer and the button pressed of a display dialog on applescript?   The following code will get me the text, but not the button:  precodeset myquestion to the text returned of (display dialog "hallo" buttons {"h", "a"} default button "a" default answer "") /code/pre  But how do I get the button which was pressed? I know I can use the following:  precodeset mybutton to button returned of (display dialog "hallo" buttons {"h", "a"} default button "a" default answer "") /code/pre  But how to I get both?  <answer281752> The emresult/em returned of a codedisplay dialog/code emcommand/em is a coderecord/code, which is a collection of emlabeled properties/em, and as such you can code it so the emvariable/em contains the whole coderecord/code and thus afterwards assign a emvariable/em for each emlabeled property/em within the emrecord/em as in the following example:  precodeset theResultReturned to (display dialog "hallo" buttons {"h", "a"} default button "a" default answer "") set theTextReturned to the text returned of theResultReturned set theButtonReturned to the button returned of theResultReturned /code/pre  ul liNote the use of codethe/code in codeto the .../code can be omitted if you want to be less verbose. Also the emvariable/em names can be less verbose as well and were written in this manner for clarity./li /ul  You can then act upon the assigned emvariables/em as needed/wanted.  Unless for reasons of how/why you're coding it necessitates it, you also can code it in a manner in which separate emvariables/em for each emlabeled property/em do not have to be explicitly set. For an example emlogic flow/em without explicit setting of emlabeled properties/em, have a look at the Examples section of the codedisplay dialog/code emcommand/em in the AppleScript Language Guide.
