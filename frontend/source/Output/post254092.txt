Deactivate 'Nike+' exclusive features form AppleWatch 2 - Nike+ edition <body> For whatever reason* you decide that you want your Apple Watch Nike Plus to function just like a standard Apple Watch:  ul lino more running notifications,/li lino ugly watch faces,/li lietc./li /ul  which are exclusive to the Nike Plus.  Is it possible to disable all NikePlus-exclusive features?  *  ul liyou really liked the Nike Plus band and can't get it any other way,/li liyou broke your leg and no more running for you,/li lisome other excuse/li /ul  <answer254111> Because the AppleWatch Nike+ edition isn't available yet this information is not available .. BUT I do can tell your able to turn off the notifications, just like the 'breath' / 'you need to stand for 1 minute' (while driving your car) notifications. You can change your watchfases to normal version but won't be able to remove the nike+ app from your watch as it's bound to the exclusive Watchface.  <comment316298> You're naming almost all reasons why I would buy the nike+ version without the nike+ stuff =)
