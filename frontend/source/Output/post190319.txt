`display notification` works from AppleScript Editor but not when exported as Application <body> I've got some short AppleScript code designed to display notifications at a specified interval. The code works perfectly from the Script Editor, but not when exported as an Application. Instead, notifications never show up in the top left though they do appear in Notification Center. However, instead of happening every interval (say once/minute) they just trigger continuously.  Here's the code:  precodeset lasttime to current date set min to 5 as number set interval to 1 as number  repeat     display notification "Notification" with title "Title"     delay (interval * 60)     if (((current date) - lasttime) / minutes) ≥ min then exit repeat end repeat /code/pre  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong here?  <answer190324> When you check the codenotification center/code you will see that the messages still appear there but the center won't notify the user strongwhen the app sending the message is in the foreground/strong.  Workaround:   Before firing the notification, activate codeFinder/code:  precodetell application "Finder" to activate  set lasttime to current date set min to 5 as number set interval to 1 as number  repeat     display notification "Notification" with title "Title"     delay (interval * 60)     if (((current date) - lasttime) / minutes) ≥ min then exit repeat end repeat /code/pre  hr  Additionally, we can do this: Run an apple script saved as run only so icon doesnt show in dock - but doing so, one must use codeActivity Monitor/code to terminate the application.  Still, we need to "de-frontmost" our application because when it launches it gets to be the active application.
