USB Flash (Pen) drive vanishes after hibernation <body> I reboot my macbook (4,1 model + 10.6.8) very infrequently since I rely on the hibernation feature a lot. I also use USB flash drives a fair bit and there is usually one plugged in to one of the USB slots.   So, when I resume from hibernation two things happen.   1) My USB flash drive is unmounted and OSX complains it was not unmounted cleanly... !?!  2) And, I cannot find the drive through strongDisk Util/strong anymore. It is just not listed.   While #1 above is annoying and pulling it out and inserting again remounts it, I would prefer though if I could simply request a remount. But I cannot. codediskutil list/code does not show the drive. strongemBut/em/strong, while researching this problem I found that the USB bus can still see it.  precode$ system_profiler SPUSBDataType USB:      USB High-Speed Bus:        Host Controller Location: Built-in USB       Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBEHCI       PCI Device ID: 0x283a        PCI Revision ID: 0x0004        PCI Vendor ID: 0x8086        Bus Number: 0xfa           Cruzer:            Product ID: 0x5530           Vendor ID: 0x0781  (SanDisk Corporation)           Version:  2.00           Serial Number: 3513630C54E0EC83           Speed: Up to 480 Mb/sec           Manufacturer: SanDisk           Location ID: 0xfa200000 / 2           Current Available (mA): 500           Current Required (mA): 200 /code/pre  So I have two questions,  1) How can I stop the drive from being unmounted? And if I cannot...  2) How can I remount without physically removing and reinserting it?  hr  EDIT:  This answer, suggests I unload the USB driver. Unfortunately it doesn't work for me...  precode$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext (kernel) Can't unload kext com.apple.iokit.IOUSBMassStorageClass; classes have instances: (kernel)     Kext com.apple.iokit.IOUSBMassStorageClass class IOUSBMassStorageClass has 2 instances.
