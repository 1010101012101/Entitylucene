Apple newbie dual monitor macbook air <body> I successfully connected my macbook air (El Capitan mid 2013) with an external monitor .I was able to change the default desktop to the new monitor . I was expecting that i could use my macbook air monitor for coding ie; to get my ide open and the external one to see the changes in browser so that there is no need to use command-tab . Right now i have to choose either one of the desktops as my main one and i can do all the work in that only . Is it possible to use both the desktops simultaneously . Please let me know and thanks in advance.  <comment355253> Have you looked at this:  [Use multiple displays with your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202351) <comment355264> @Allan Yes , i did everything in ' extended desktop ' but i just could use either the additional display or my mac's display .... ie; the ' primary display' only works , whenever i try to open an app in the other it is being opened in the primary. <comment355271> In order to assist you, we need much more info like the make and model of the display, how you are connecting, etc.  Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder. <comment355287> Sorry i thought the os version and make year was enough . I am using a mini display port to VGA adapter and the monitor is Dell 24" Full HD . Please let me know if you want to know any other details .
