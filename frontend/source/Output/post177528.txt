To use MySQL, system preferences must quit and reopen, and quit and reopen <body> How do I just get the MySQL Admin GUI to run:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3LGbo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  then:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7L1wC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  final loop:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/geB1g.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I can't seem to get out of whatever sort of infinite loop is in there.  <comment210040> It's been a long time since I've used this since most of the command offered are easily learned and accessed via command line, however the problem is/was that the preference pane was 32 bit and system preferences needed to run in 32 bit to launch it (thus the restart). Not sure what's causing the loop though, maybe the System Preferences no longer runs 32 bit at all, so it keeps trying to restart and fails. <comment210189> can I this to the mac store and have them install MySQL?  Or, will they just uninstall MySQL because of their support boundaries? <comment210220> @Thufir Which MySQL version did you install? MySQL Community Server (GPL) 5.6.23? <comment210346> @klanomath probably the wrong one, I'll check that out..
