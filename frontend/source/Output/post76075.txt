How to extend bootcamp partition? <body> When I was installing windows 7 on my mac I allocated 55GB to my bootcamp partition, I now realise that it is not enough for me. is there a way to extend it, without loosing any data and re-instaling windows?  Additionally, is it possible to store files on Macintosh HD partition (as it shows up when I access my computer from windows) while using windows? That would solve the problem, however I'm not sure if it will work.  <answer76087> This should work:  1) First, shrink an strongadjacent/strong partition to make room using Disk Utility in MacOS:  ul liLaunch Disk Utility in MacOS  /li liIdentify the Windows partition and the adjacent ones /li liUsing Disk Utility, shrink one (or both) adjacent partitions/li /ul  2) Then in Windows, expand the bootcamp partition.  <answer94667> For all my partitioning, I use and recommend strongiPartition/strong.  iPartition allows you to modify Boot Camp partitions just like regular partitions. iPartition will reconfigure the Windows partitions automatically.     You can use iPartition on drives that contain Boot Camp volumes; in fact, you can even resize your Windows partitions, and let iPartition take care of reconfiguring the Windows boot process for you.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/10jKA.jpg" alt="iPartition Screenshot 1"      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W49Wg.jpg" alt="iPartition Screenshot 2"   <answer103162> I second the recommendation for iPartition, I've been using Coriolis Software's iPartition &amp; iDefrag for many years - seemingly bullet proof, and will allow you to shorten the Mac-HD partition &amp; lengthen the Windows partition in one operation.  Alternatively (or as well), for Windows to be able to see (have r/w access) to a HFS+ partition, you need a HFS+ file system driver installed in Windows.  I think there's free ones, but I have used &amp; can recommend Paragon Software's pair of file-sys drivers, for Windows to access HFS+ partitions, and for Mac to have r/w access to NTFS partitions (by itself Mac can only read NTFS, not write).  <comment88354> what do you mean buy that? Should I make another partition like 15GB and than merge it with bootcamp one? I don't understand. <comment96792> Breakdown of step 1:  a) Launch Disk Utility in MacOS b) Identify the Windows partition and the adjacent ones. c) Using Disk Utility, shrink one (or both) adjacent partitions. <comment121437> AFAIK the Boot Camp WindowsSupport drivers allow Windows to read/write to HFS+ without the need for 3rd party softwareâ€¦
