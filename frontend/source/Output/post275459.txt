What should I do about a Mac Mini whose fusion drive is getting steadily slower and slower? <body> I have a 2012 Mac Mini (running OS/X 10.11.6) with an Apple-provided internal 1TB fusion drive that appears to be suffering from some kind of performance problem -- it seems to be getting slower and slower over time, to the point where it can be quite painful to use.  For example, applications can take 10-20 seconds to open, and Mac Mail in particular can take several minutes to bring up an email or bring up the file requester to add an attachment.  Is there any procedure recommended to bring the Mac Mini back up to its original speed?  I suppose if all else fails I could always do a low-level format of the Fusion Drive and then re-install everything from a Time Machine backup, but I'm not certain that that would solve the performance problem, or that the Fusion Drive logic would be set up correctly after that.  Is there anything less drastic that might be effective?  strongSpec summary:/strong  ul liLate-2012 Mac Mini/li li1TB Fusion Drive (less than 75% full)/li li8GB RAM/li liMac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6/li /ul  <answer275464> strong[This answer not final until this sentence removed]/strong  As you probably know, troubleshooting is a process of elimination and can require quite a bit of patience.  The first things I'd do in your situation are to try booting in Safe Mode and, if no joy afterwards, reset both your NVRAM and SMC.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your Mac Mini into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac Mini/li liRestart your Mac Mini/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice.

It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys.

Once you've reset your NVRAM, proceed to reset your SMC as well.  strongReset SMC/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liUnplug it from power/li liWait 15 seconds/li liPlug the power cord back in/li liWait for an additional 5 seconds/li liPress the power button to turn it back on/li /ol  Once you're booted back in, take a note of how your Mac Mini is running and we'll go from there.  <comment346545> How much free space do you have? Also, how much RAM do you have? Finally, what have you already tried to resolve the issue? <comment346546> Plenty of free space (I forget exactly how much but I believe the drive is less than 75% full -- of course that figure is for the combined drive, I suspect the SSD part of the fusion system is near-full but I'm not sure how to check that).  8GB RAM on this machine.  I haven't tried anything to fix it yet, except rebuild Mac Mail's database index, which didn't help.
