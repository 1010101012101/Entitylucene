Sound output device disappeared after upgrade <body> I have my Samsung TV connected to my Macbook Air via HDMI/thunderbolt. Everything was working just fine until I upgraded to Yosemite (10.10.5).  At the moment, in the "sound" configuration in the "output" tab I don't see anything except internal speakers and I can see the images on the TV but there is no audio.  [I already rebooted, but with no change in behavior.]  Any idea on how to fix this?  <answer243959> If you have the speaker icon in your menu bar, hold down kbdoption/kbd key and click on the speaker to choose your inputs/outputs.  If you don't see the device you are looking for, go to Launchpad - Other and look for strongAudio MIDI Setup/strong. In the bottom left corner you will see a kbd+/kbd sign, click on this to add new inputs/outputs for it and then configure them.  If you don't see the device you would like to add, I suggest you start troubleshooting. Remove all the cables there is, switch off and wait, switch on and hold down kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdP/kbd until it restarts again then release. (resetting PRAM)
