QuickLook and plist files <body> I have the latest Xcode installed, but I can't "quicklook" plist files (I mean they appear as an xml file instead of a table). Is this normal?  <answer82264> Afaik yes. This is normal. You can drag n drop the plist onto Xcode and it should open it in a tree form  <answer82272> Plist files and .properties-files can't normally be QuickLook'ed. You could try to QLStephen, which let's you QuickLook any files without an extension, and with extensions such as .plist and .properties (according to this answer) in plain text.  <comment119827> Finder seems to be able to QuickLook binary .plists (However I do have Xcode installed) <comment305467> QLStephen works great but you need to configure it to handle files with extensions like this: https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen/issues/23
