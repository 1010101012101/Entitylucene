How to monitor and control thermal CPU throttling in OS X? <body> I recently came across the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility for Windows. I tried it under Bootcamp Windows and it was very interesting to learn in what situations my MacBook Pro's (mid2012) CPU is doing thermal throttling. The tool is also designed to change the CPU's voltage, in order to reduce thermal throttling. However, this option was not available.  So my questions are:   ol listrongIs there a similar tool to monitor CPU (thermal) throttling under OS X (Yosemite)?/strong emAnswering this part will qualify to accept the answer ;-)/em/li liWhy was the option to alter the CPU voltage not available under Bootcamp? Is this feature not supported by my CPU (i7 2.6 GHz Ivy Bridge 3720QM)?/li liIf my CPU is capable of changing its voltage, is there a way to reduce CPU voltage in OS X?/li /ol  Disclaimer: Yes, I know that this may potentially break my hardware. No warnings necessary ;-)  <answer244380> I would also like a utility to perform this function.    I don't know how to monitor this in OSX, but there is a way to reduce it:  SMC Fan Control.  This utility allows you to manually set your fans' speeds, which will cool the machine, reducing the throttling somewhat.  <comment301399> this will only help to avoid peaks. if the CPU is under full load for a while the fans will run at 100% anyway.
