Selective Backup in Apple Mail Email Client <body> I have an IMAP Gmail account which I have logged in through Apple Mail email client on my Mac book pro. I have sorted out some important emails and made a separate folder for those emails. Is it possible to backup only that email folder and not all the emails along with them? Thanks for your help.   <answer254277> In mail.app, you can select a folder and from the main menu choose ‘Mailbox  Export Mailbox’, select a location for the export file and click ‘choose’.  Mail exports the mailbox as an .mbox package.

I found Mail Backup X, got the trial version of this application. This is the only thing that I needed.
