How do I open a file from Spotlight in Finder? <body> When I search for something e.g. a PDF file, in Spotlight and has i displayed in the search results list. How can I open the file in Finder? If I click on it, the file is opened e.g. in the pdf reader, but I would like to know where on the file system it is.  Any suggestions?  <answer33810> Hitting kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21A9;/kbd does the trick.  <comment38584> Are you sure? This does not work for me. <comment38585> works for me :-) Did you change key assignments in the past? <comment38586> or Cmd-click did also work. Thanks. <comment38590> ⌘R and ⇧⌘R work as well. <comment38592> Oh, wait. I thought that by return you meant the ``-`` key. :-) I'm German and got confused. Now, it works for me as well. <comment38596> Matt, the "Rücktaste" is definitively something different :-)
