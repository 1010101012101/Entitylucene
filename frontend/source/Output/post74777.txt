echo color coding stopped working in mountain lion <body> The following produced text with different color on terminal in Lion, but not in Mountain Lion. Why? What can be done to echo in color on Mountain Lion?  precodeecho -e "Some text \e[0;32m in color \e[0m no more color"; /code/pre  In mountain Lion it just prints as if -e wasn't given as an argument to echo.  <answer74778> The problem was that the escape code \e has been removed in mountain lion's version of echo.  Change \e to \033 and it will work.  <answer74843> As described in the Application Usage section of the POSIX description of the emecho/em command, the code-n/code option and escape sequences are not very portable (due to different support in the various branches of the Unix family tree).  The codeprintf/code command (which, like emecho/em, is also builtin to most shells, and available as an external command) is more reliably standardized (though the syntax is not the same; e.g. you need to watch for code%/code in the first argument, and multiple arguments are not automatically joined with a space):  precodeprintf 'Some text \e[0;32m in color \e[0m no more color\n'  printf '%s \e[0;32m%s\e[0m %s\n' 'Some text' 'in color' 'no more color' /code/pre  <answer253103> A reliable way to do this is through tput:  precodeRED=`tput setaf 1` GREEN=`tput setaf 2` NOCOLOR=`tput sgr0`  echo "Some text ${RED}in red color${NOCOLOR} no more color" /code/pre  <comment86873> Strangely, man echo does not mention the -e flag, even though the -e flag works. At least for \n <comment86948> The manage for *echo* describes the `/bin/echo` external command, not the *echo* that is built into the shell that you happen to be using (e.g. the one named in the `#!` line at the top of your script). You need to consult the manpage for the shell that you are using (probably *bash*) to see what options its internal *echo* supports. <comment87477> Thanks Chris, accepted your answer since it was better than the one I found. <comment196024> This site holds true for Yosemite, cheers much appreciated..
