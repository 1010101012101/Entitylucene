Is there anyway to tweak TextEdit for coding/scripting? <body> I personally prefer to use whatever coming with the OS X instead of installing 3rd party software to meet my needs...However TextEdit is a little bit struggle for me...Anyway TextEdit can be tweaked for code editor basics?  ol liIndentation for 4-space instead of 8-space when using Tab key/li liCode syntax highlighting, mainly python./li liBrace matching/li /ol  If it is not possible with current app for above 3 features? Then can you please recommend free light weight alternatives?  PS. I do use codevim/code but sometime prefer a GUI App...  <comment307790> The title of your post is "_Is there anyway to tweak TextEdit for coding/scripting?_" and you go on to say "_Anyway TextEdit can be tweaked for code editor basics:_", so you start by asking if it can and then state that it can, or did you mean to put the word "_can_" between "_Anyway_" and  "_TextEdit_" instead of after it? Anyway, looking at TextEdit  Preferencesâ€¦ I see nothing to apply the tweak mentioned. [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) is free and works for _coding_. Not free, but I prefer to use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com). <comment307791> That is a typo...Thanks for pointing out.
