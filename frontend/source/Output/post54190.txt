Could not execute the java executable while running Play 1.2.1 <body> I am facing this issue whenever I am trying to run Play 1.2.1 in my system. Previously, I had Play 2.0 in my system. I exported the code$PATH/code variable so that code$PATH/code contains the path to Play 2.0 directory.  Now, I am trying to run Play 1.2.1 in Mac OS X 10.7.4.  My PATH variable looks like:   precode-bash: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/Users/sabya/Documents/Play_Framework/play-2.0: No such file or directory /code/pre  After exporting the code$PATH/code for play 1.2.1 my code$PATH/code looks like:  precode-bash: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/Users/sabya/Documents/Play_Framework/play-2.0:/Users/sabya/Downloads/Work/play-1.2.1: No such file or directory /code/pre  I created a new project through codeplay new test_app/code. But whenever I am trying to do codeplay run/code, it shows:  precodeCould not execute the java executable, please make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set properly (the java executable should reside at JAVA_HOME/bin/java). /code/pre  Calling codejavac/code or codejava/code in the same directory gives me proper output.  Echoing code$JAVA_HOME/code returns code-bash: /Library/Java/Home: No such file or directory/code  Everything works fine in Ubuntu.  What is the workaround for this situation? I have Googled extensively, but I did not get anything suitable.  Is the trailing ":" in code$JAVA_HOME/code a problem?  <comment62024> I can assure you that a trailing colon in your `$JAVA_HOME` is not the problem. As to the rest of it, could you please describe Play (what it is, what it's supposed to do, how it's supposed to work)? <comment62027> Thanks CajunLuke for the comment . Play is a framework for web development. For more description visit www.playframework.org
