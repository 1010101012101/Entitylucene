Time Machine backs up way too much, never finishes <body> I have a major problem with Time Machine. It started a few weeks ago when it started to back up too much data (strangely, only on backups after reboots). Last week, the backup volume ran out of space. Hence Time Machine began to reclaim it, but eventually emall but one/em of the older backups were deleted.  I prepared another volume for a fresh backup, and started in Single User Mode (according to this) and created new preferences (found this here). After copying all the data (~110GB), Time Machine just continued to fill the backup disk, and claims it would create the index. Maybe it is, since this   precode24.09.13 19:02:15   com.apple.backupd[811]  Waiting for index to be ready (100) /code/pre  pops up in Console a lot. In the meantime, it filled the backup disk (which is on a NAS btw) with ~300GB, so I guess something is seriously broken. What is it?
