Dictionaries on iOS 9 not working <body> I just updated to iOS 9, and I noticed that the built-in dictionaries, I previously used, aren't working. I had used American English, British English, and Apple Dictionary. Now, when I try to define any word, I get a "No definition found" error. The dictionaries I previously used show a blue circle (while all the others show the cloud download icon).  <answer206422> I was also facing the same issue...just go to Settings-General-Reset-Reset All Settings. This will solve your problem.  <answer206505> I was so sad when this happened to me because I practically have no vocabulary It's an easy fix though you go to settings-general-reset-reset keyboard dictionary.  Trust me it won't do anything bad. I freaked out when I saw you have to reset it but you only have to reset the dictionary keyboard to work. A plus is that it still has your dictionaries downloaded and ready to go after you've reset it  <answer206518> Sounds like a bug to me. Not even iOS is completely immune to them, even after a long public beta period. So, not a lot that you can do other than wait for iOS 9.0.1 and hope that it will fix that issue with the dictionary.  <comment249128> I'm having the same issue <comment249129> That doesn't fix the downloaded dictionaries that define words, only the user dictionary which affects spelling / autocorrect. <comment249130> That doesn't fix the downloaded dictionaries that define words, only the user dictionary which affects spelling / autocorrect. <comment249373> I had the same issue, so annoying <comment307853> Any ideas if this has been fixed in 9.3.3, I tried all the suggestions in tried all the suggestions in [this answer] (http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/210483/10733) with no luck.
