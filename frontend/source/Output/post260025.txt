Why does my iPhone say Activation Required? <body> Why does my iPhone say Activation Required? It started doing this out of nowhere. I try to unlock it and it goes to Activation Lock. It says "This iPhone is linked to an Apple ID. Enter the Apple ID and password that were used to set up this iPhone."  In the "Activation Help" link it goes to a page:     A password is required to activate this device because its owner has used Find My iPhone to link it to their Apple ID.   I never used Find My iPhone. I also had 2 factor authentication.  Why would my iPhone suddenly brick itself? It doesn't make any sense that an iPhone can just lock itself and render the whole phone useless!  <answer260030> Not sure that this is your issue if you have an iPhone 5, but some brand new iPhone 6S's and 7's have been exhibiting similar behaviour recently:  http://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/05/iphone-activation-lock-wrong-apple-id-issues/  This message usually shows you some letters of the Apple ID that it needs the password for -- presumably they definitely don't match any email address you recognise?  Either way, if you need to enter the password for an Apple ID that isn't known to you, then I'm afraid it's likely only Apple can help you sort it out.  <comment325617> It did show my own email address with parts starred out. Stuff like this makes me want to go back to an Android!
