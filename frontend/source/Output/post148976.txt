Would like to create border around display <body> I have a macbook with a damaged screen. OS 10.7.5. The top edge of display is "bleeding" black and covering up some of the menu items. This is due to it being dropped. Opposite of others that have this problem, I would like to create a "border" around the desktop so that all of the menu items are visible. Otherwise the macbook is working fine, so we'd like to get use out of this for our students. Is this an aspect ration setting and how could I do this - maybe via terminal? Thanks!  <comment175484> what is your exact model? <comment175490> i tried the duplicate solution but my screen went completely black!
