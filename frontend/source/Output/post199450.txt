Update iMovie in OS X 10.6.8 <body> My iMac is running OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).  I still have iMovie 7.1.4. How do I update it? And which version of iMovie is it compatible with OS X 10.6.8?  <answer199457> You can get the iMovie 8.0.6 from Apple website  https://support.apple.com/kb/dl859?locale=en_US  You can also buy it on Amazon, the "iLife 11" package that contains iMovie 09 version.  <comment240073> I wouldn't do anything until you have fixed your other issue at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/199453/imovies-error-50
