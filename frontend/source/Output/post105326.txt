Seemingly missing Apple ID account <body> I have been buying apps for months using the exact same Apple ID password with no problem. Then my iPod Touch started telling me that it is wrong. I tried the "I forgot" option, but it did not help. I cannot access my account either and when I looked for it, the page said my account could not be found.  How do I get my account back?  <answer105327> Did you try the steps on http://appleid.apple.com ? (+ answering the secure questions) (eg: Reset password)  <comment123827> I didn't try that site, Thanks! <comment123828> As this is the way to manage your apple-id (and restore passwords in case you lost them), please approve my answer
