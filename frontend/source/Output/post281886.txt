MBP Touch bar control strip gone <body> The control strip of my touch bar is not working anymore. Even after a full restart or start in safe mode.  There's nothing on the 'screen'. (Neither in Mac or Windows via Bootcamp) It doesn't respond to taps. In keyboard preferences the usual touchbar related properties are gone as well, as if my Mac doesn't even have a touch bar.  The Touch ID part (fingerprint) works fine though...  Any steps I can take to diagnose this?   <answer281911> The first things I would do are resetting your NVRAM followed by resetting your SMC. If resetting these doesn't resolve it, run Apple Diagnostics.   Before doing any of the following, ensure your MBP isn't connected to any external devices (e.g. display, external hard drive, etc).  strongResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models/strong  To reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. /li liKeep these keys pressed down for strongat least 20 seconds!/strong/li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote 1:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongReset the SMC/strong  Your MacBook Pro has a system management controller that can easily be reset.

This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   <comment354830> Have you tried resetting the SMC? My guess is this will solve the problem <comment354995> Thanks for the suggestions. Unfortunately did not help though. (the diagnostics saying "no issues") I also got the kernel panic screen (and auto restart) like 4 times in 2 hours. :/ So yeah, guess I'll contact apple. <comment355006> Good idea. I think this is going to be one for Apple to sort out. Good luck! <comment373885> Tom, I got the same issue. How did you fix it?
