Can I use memory taken from a Macbook Pro in a Mac Pro? <body> My Macbook Pro from around 2008 finally died. It has two 1 GB memory chips. (Specifically, two of this Samsung chip.) My question is: can I use these chips in my 2011 Mac Pro?   <answer81615> No, not directly.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3rf5V.jpg" alt="Image from laptopnews.ro at laptopnews.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dimm_vs_so-dimm.jpg"  The Mac Pro uses full-sized desktop DIMM modules, whereas the Macbook pro uses laptop-sized SO-DIMM modules. These cannot be directly swapped without a passive adapter, which I honestly wouldn't think makes much sense to bother with given how inexpensive 2 GB of RAM is these days for a Mac Pro.  <comment94126> Thanks. Yeah, that doesn't really make sense. It was mostly me being sentimental. I think I'll just keep the SO-DIMM's around as a souvenir. Or perhaps I'll see if I can slot them into a Samsung Windows laptop I have... If that's not blasphemy!
