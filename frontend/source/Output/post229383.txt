iOS MDM: Managed and private instance of apps? <body> When installing and configuring an app via MDM for managed iOS devices, can a user install a second copy of the app for personal use (with different data and settings)?  If not, what will happen if the user has the app already installed? Will existing data be lost, will the existing data come under MDM control (and subsequently be deleted with the app on MDM profile uninstall), or will the install just fail?
