iPhone Photos app adds random people to the people album <body> When I take photos of a crowded place, I often get random strangers in the shot, facing in my direction. The iPhone Photos app then adds these strangers to the strongPeople/strong album.  How can I remove these strangers? The only solution Iâ€™ve found was to hide the photo, but that hides it from Moments, which I don't want.  I'm using an iPhone 6, iOS 10.3.3.  <answer295314> In the People album (where all the faces are shown), choose the Select button at the top-right, then select the people to remove and choose Remove in the bottom-left.  <answer295316> Directly from the strongPeople/strong album, tap emSelect/em in the top-right corner. Next select all the faces you don't know, then tap codeHide/code in the bottom-left corner.  This will hide those people from your strongPeople/strong album without hiding the photos themselves.
