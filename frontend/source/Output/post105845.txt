Test Z-Wave on OSX <body> I have an old ZWave stick that I was hoping to get working with my OSX computer. I know for a fact the manufacturer never supported OSX (Intermatic HA22) but I was hoping I could hack away a little bit myself. When I plug it in it seems to see the USB stick...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/owwal.png" alt="About my mac"  So now is there an easy way to test this to ensure it works?   For bonus points...  Is there anyway to tell where it is mounted so I can just write to it like a normal serial port? I tried to diff the /dev folder before and after removing but I didn't see anything change. Am I supposed to be looking in another folder?  Thanks guys!   P.S we really should have a Z-wave tag in here.  <comment124447> Z wave is too uncommon to warrant it's own tag <comment124456> I would argue currently too uncommon but ok I get it. Any idea on the reset of the question? I am trying to compile Open-Zwave-ControlPanel right now. But running into some issues. If I get it running I will answer it soon.
