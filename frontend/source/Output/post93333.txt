Where can I find a projector case which is compatible with the iphone 5? <body> I've managed to locate numerous cases which are what I'm looking for but none are available for the Iphone 5 model. I have an adapter cord but obviously that defeats the purpose of having the device be a case.  Is such a case in production currently? When can I expect one to come into production?  <answer93612> http://dx.com/p/a50p-2-in-1-pico-projector-battery-pack-for-iphone-5-ipad-mini-samsung-galaxy-s2-black-201546  I have ordered many items from DealExtreme so far and I am overall satisfied with the quality-price and their great support and after sales team. You can trust.  <comment109845> Well that's not really what I was looking for, it's not a case.
