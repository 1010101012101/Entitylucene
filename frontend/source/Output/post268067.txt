Increase fade in/out from/to black time in iMovie 10.1.4? <body> Is it possible to increase the length of time that the fade in/out from/to black takes when editing a video in iMovie (added using the Settings pop-up menu in the video timeline(?) panel at the bottom of the iMovie window (apologies if I'm not using the correct terminology))?   (I have to say that I don't find the iMovie interface particularly intuitive and that it seems to be a little fiddly to try to change effects once you have added them to a video. I tried searching, but I couldn't find anything in the Help about this.)  <answer268798> emEdit: Later, I found a much easier solution using Cross Dissolve (see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/268993/50985 ). So I don't recommend these steps anymore, but I'm leaving it here for educational purposes./em  No, you cannot change the fade time in codeSettings &gt; Fade Out to Black/code.  Even the manual codeTransitions &gt; Fade to Black/code does not work well, it still fades too quickly. It already reaches black merely 33% into the duration of the transition. I spent hours and figured out a workaround (messy but achieves the desired result).  Let's say you want a fade to black in the last 5 seconds of your video. To achieve that, you will need to set the codeTransitions &gt; Fade to Black/code to 15 seconds so that it will fade to black in 5 seconds. Then we will throw away the extra 10 seconds (not trivial).  ul liAdd your clip to the timeline./li licodeModify &gt; Detach Audio/code. (This is necessary because the audio fades slower than the video. The video is black around 33% into the duration, whereas the audio can still be heard about 90% into the duration)./li liGo to the end of the audio clip and drag the audio handle to the left to create a 5s audio fade out./li licodeModify &gt; Add Freeze Frame/code. Then click on the freeze frame and change the Duration to 10s in the preview panel. (This adds the extra 10 second pad at the end)./li liDrag the codeTransitions &gt; Fade to Black/code effect to the end of the timeline. Double click on it to change the Duration to 15s. (The timeline will look messed up, but it's okay)./li liPlay your video and make sure the fade to black is satisfactory (video and audio). There should be an extra 10s of black silence at the end./li licodeFile &gt; Share &gt; File/code to export an mp4 video./li liOpen the mp4 video with QuickTime./li licodeEdit &gt; Trim/code. Drag the right handle left by 10s and click Trim./li licodeFile &gt; Save/code to save the trimmed mp4 file. (I'm pretty sure this is a lossless trim because it saved a 100MB video instantly)./li liNow view the final mp4 video to make sure everything is right./li /ul  See how easy and intuitive Mac software is? (I did the same thing in Windows Movie Maker in one step).  <answer268993> No, you cannot change the fade time in codeSettings &gt; Fade Out to Black./code  Even the manual codeTransitions &gt; Fade to Black/code does not work well because it fades to black too quickly (in about 1/3 of the duration of the transition), then it's black for the remaining 2/3 of the duration.  If you want a linear fade to black that you can set the duration, just add a codeCross Dissolve/code to the end of the timeline and set the Duration of transition.  <comment338474> Thanks, I upvoted this answer in appreciation of your time and effort in researching this possible solution (I don't currently have enough points for this to show!). <comment338476> And thanks again for finding a simpler solution (In the end I didn't manage to investigate this properly; I had numerous problems getting iMovie to correctly 'remember' the timepoints for captions and time/frame adjustments that I made, so that creating my edited videos was extremely awkward. I don't know if perhaps my Mac just has too little RAM, or if iMovie is somewhat glitchy, but I think I will try a different video editing solution if I need to do similar again!)
