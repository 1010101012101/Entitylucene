Any way to reboot a iDevice that is connected to a USB port via terminal (Mac terminal)? <body> So, I am making a program to reboot iDevices (if there power buttons are broken), is there any way to induce the iDevice to reboot via the Mac shell?   <answer177217> idevicediagnostics restart  you can substitute shutdown for restart.  on Ubuntu 14.04  <answer196021> codeidevicediagnostics/code is a Linux tool which can help here.
