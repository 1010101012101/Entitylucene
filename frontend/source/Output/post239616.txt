Health app double counts steps <body> I am using an iPhone 6 with iOS 9.3.2. It happens that codeHealth/code app doubles step count (and therefore also doubles distance). I know this beacause the amount is too high (about double, I should be running to have 6 km/hour walking speed) and I beacause I tested it (I know the walking distance to my work because of Google) I have checked on codePrivacy/code which apps can write walking distance and I switched them off, however everything remains the same.  In addition, I checked codeData sources/code on the codeStep/code dashboard on codeHealth/code following fbara's suggestion. However there are only two apps on codeData Sources/code: my codePhone/code and codeHealth/code App. None of the can be unchecked nor removed nor dragged up and down. The data  supplied by them is very weird: codeHealth/code App supplies little steps certain specifics days while my codePhone/code source supplies everyday almost all steps. Its supply is already doubled.  It is worth noting that for a long time I didn't have problems   Thanks in advance!  Does some one know how to solve this?  <answer239622> It looks like the codeHealth/code app is still (even after you turned things off) aggregating step data.  Instead of going to codePrivacy/code, go to the codeHealth/code app.  Next go to the dashboard and tap on the codeSteps/code pane. Tap codeShare Data/code and then the codeEdit/code button on the top right.  Make sure only 1 app is supplying the step data, whichever app you want to use.   While still in codeEdit/code mode, go to the codeData Sources/code section.  Drag that single source to the top so it's the first row.    Hopefully, this will prevent any other source from supplying step data.  <comment294157> Thank you for the answer fbara. However there are only two apps on `Data Sources`: my Phone and `Health App`. None of the can be unchecked nor removed nor dragged up and down. The data  supplied by them is very weird: `Health App` supplies little steps certain specifics days while my `Phone` source supplies everyday almost all steps. Its supply is already doubled. It's worth saying that the health start doubling the count quite recently. In the beginning it was not like this
