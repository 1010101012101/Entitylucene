How to repair a drive after accidentally changing the partition scheme? <body> I was using the Boot Camp. Somehow I managed to change the GPT partition scheme on my external hard drive to a MBR partition scheme. Below is the output from the command codesudo gpt -r -vvv show /dev/disk1/code.   precodegpt show: /dev/disk1: mediasize=1000204886016; sectorsize=512; blocks=1953525168 gpt show: /dev/disk1: Suspicious MBR at sector 0 gpt show: /dev/disk1: Bad CRC in GPT table at sector 2 gpt show: /dev/disk1: Sec GPT at sector 1953525167        start        size  index  contents            0           1         MBR            1      409639                409640  1829583888      2  MBR part 175   1829993528     1531680      3  MBR part 171   1831525208   121999927            1953525135          32         Sec GPT table   1953525167           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  I was booting OS X from this external drive. I am trying to make this drive functional without losing all the data on it.   <answer246057> The output from the codegpt/code command indicates the following.  ul liWhile there is no indication that there is a problem with the primary GUID Partition Table (GPT) header, the entries appear to have been corrupted./li liThe secondary (backup) GPT header and entries are intact./li liThe MBR tables contains at least two partition entries. One entry is a OS X partition (type 175=0xAF). Another entry is an OS X recovery partition (type 171=0xAB)./li /ul  Under normal circumstances, the following is true.   ul liThe codegpt/code command does not display MBR partition entry for partitions of type 0xEE./li liSome of the primary and secondary GPT headers values differ, therefore the headers not identical./li liThe primary and secondary GPT entries themselves are actually identical./li /ul  Therefore, copying the entries, from the secondary GPT to the primary GPT, should fix the partition table errors. The commands give below will do this. (I assume the external drive is still codedisk1/code).  precodediskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1 sudo dd if=/dev/disk1 of=/dev/disk1 count=32 conv=notrunc seek=2 skip=1953525135  /code/pre     strongEven if the above commands fix the partition table errors, there is no guarantee the data, stored in the partitions, has not been corrupted./strong   <comment303005> I can see that you changed the partitioning scheme from GPT to MBR. The problem seems to be repairable. Normally, Macs boot from `disk0`. Why do you show `disk1`? <comment303151> It is showing disk1 because it is setup through a external usb I reinstalled OSX on another hard drive <comment303161> I am attempting to get this question reopened. If my edits are wrong, then make corrections. If the question does not get reopened, then I will try to find another way to post an answer. <comment303164> The question is clear to me and describes a common situation. How can I submit an answer to it?
