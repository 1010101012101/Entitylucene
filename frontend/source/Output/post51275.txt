Lion Server with Profile Manager <body> I setup a few profiles in the profile manager and when I remove them from the profile they still seem to be applied on the clients. Like to test around I made a change to the dock size and then un-applied it so it isn't even listed but yet the client cannot change their dock size anymore.   How do I completely revert a change made?  <answer51276> Remove the profile from the client system preference pane.
