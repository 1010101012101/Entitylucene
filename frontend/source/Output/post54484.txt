Is it possible to clear Printer Simulator logs? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E4duj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Where could I find Printer Simulator logs?  <comment62450> What exactly are you referring to with Printer Simulator? If you find it hard to explain, can you either add a screenshot or describe the steps you take to use it? <comment63036> Seriously?..have you tried clicking on 'Show in Finder". This also not really the right place to be asking this question. It is development tool and would be more likely to get an answer on Stack Overflow, or the Apple Developer Forums
