Are photos still backed up in iCloud backup even if iCloud Photo Library is off? <body> I have 50GB of iCloud storage and want to backup all my photos. If I make a regular iCloud backup it says the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWvp6.png" alt="iCloud Backup"  So I assumed it was my backing up my photos until I stumbled upon this page a few days later.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7hNc.png" alt="iCloud Photo Library Upload"  Before I had iCloud Photo Library switched off and now I switched it on it says it is uploading 4000 photos.   I'm a little confused. Does iCloud not backup photos unless you switch on iCloud Photo Library? Or does it?   <answer280509> iOS emdoes backup your photos/em as part of its normal backup process, emunless/em you enable strongiCloud Photo Library/strong, in which case:     Photo Library is backed up separately as part of iCloud Photo Library.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0BZm.png" alt="Choose Data To Back Up"  Through the normal backup process (strongiCloud Photo Library/strong emdisabled/em), your photos are backed up at most once every 24 hours along with the rest of your data, when your iPhone is on Wi-Fi, charged, and locked. Those photos can only be recovered by emrestoring your iPhone/em from your iCloud backup.  With strongiCloud Photo Library/strong emenabled/em, your photos get uploaded to iCloud every time you’re on Wi-Fi. This is a emsyncing/em process rather than a “backup” per se. However in the event that you lose your iPhone you will still be able to recover your photos from iCloud (even emwithout/em restoring your new iPhone from backup). Therefore this option emacts as a backup/em for your photos.  This distinction is a bit of a technicality, but the important part is you can consider your photos backed up to iCloud, no matter which option you choose. Since there is no need to backup your photos to iCloud twice, iOS only does one or the other.  What you’re seeing in that second screen is your photos being uploaded to your strongiCloud Photo Library/strong specifically. It’s a different/separate method from the regular backup, which is why the photos need to be uploaded again. It doesn’t mean your photos never got backed up before.  If you have multiple Apple devices, I would advise you to keep using strongiCloud Photo Library/strong, since that presents many advantages beyond a simple backup: quicker backup of your photos, synchronizing photos across devices, saving storage on your iPhone, allowing you to bring all your photos onto a new device, etc.
