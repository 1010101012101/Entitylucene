How to listen to the same song at the same time on 2 different iPhones? <body> My girlfriend stay far way from me, but we have a habit that is listening to music together in the morning. But now we have to do that by playing loud by a Computer so that the quality is so low. I wonder that any IOS app can help us listen to the same song at the same time, i.e. when I press Play button, the song will be played at the same time in my iPhone and her iPhone too.  <answer144995> There are couple of young coders who met at 2013 WWDC after getting a scholarships from Apple who had the same idea you describe. They brought out an app called  Audibly      strongDescription/strong      Audibly plays your music in sync across nearby iOS devices. Just   choose the songs you want, link up some devices, and you're ready to   go.      Hanging out with friends and want to play a song, but your phone’s   speakers aren't loud enough? Instantly create a wireless surround   sound system and forget messy headphone cables.      Features: • Create a playlist of songs from your own library • Control   the volume across all the devices • Music kept in sync as you listen •   Use filters to change the pitch of the music • Favorite what’s playing   to come back to it later • No Internet connection required*      Audibly was first created at WWDC by a group of Student Scholarship   Recipients: Nick Frey, Chris Galzerano, and Veeral Patel.      ul   liMusic can be streamed over Peer-to-Peer Wi-Fi on newer, supported devices, anywhere you are without an Internet connection. Devices can   also connect over a Wi-Fi network./li   /ul   They still have some bugs to iron out but I have used it and it works well.   <answer146769> Grooveshark is a music service à la Spotify and Pandora, with the key feature that you can play any song on demand and to build a playlist in advance.   You can then broadcast the music playing as a station others can tune in to using Grooveshark as well.

Airfoil Satellite can do basic remote control of some music apps/services (on your PC or Mac) - or if you use iTunes you could use Apple's strongiTunes Remote/strong app to control what you listen to.  Airfoil is commercial software, I don't know of a free equivalent.  <answer283634> In my case, I use a great online platform to listen music from youtube videos called Festa (www.festa.co)  It's a video player but only focused on music, and the great advantage of Festa is that when you create your account, you will get an account name which you can share with your friends, they can access to that URL from their computers or mobile phones and view your playlist and add songs to that playlist.   The interesting part is that it also show them a button to listen live, so the same music you are playing, they will be able to listen to.  This is an amazing and simple way to listen music with my friends but the only problem now is that listen live function only works if your firends are connected from another Laptop or iMac, it doesn't work on mobile phones yet.  The guys who created the platform are working on that feauterd, but for now it's amazing to listen the same music with my firends and also let them add songs to the playlist in real time. Everything without need to install any software!  <answer294302> AMPME is the exact Application that fulfill your requirements.  iOS - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ampme-play-music-louder/id986905979?mt=8 Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amp.android&amp;hl=en  <answer294856> You can try https://www.jqbx.fm if you have spotify. They have an iOS app, website and desktop app. You would just make a private room for the two of you (or I guess you could make it public, your call) then just play tracks back and forth wherever you are.  <comment170804> Don't understand why you both can not play the same song using your devices. She would have to press the play as well. <comment170805> Some of the streaming services allow you to sort of do this.  If your expecting to both be synched or hearing the same notes or words at the same moment, you won't, due to latency you will never be exactly in synch. <comment357633> The link seems to lead to a 404 page <comment357634> Also please state your affiliation with the platform <comment357702> @patrix I'm not affiliated... I'm just the friend of the ceo of that platform :) <comment371471> Sorry, but we are looking for the reason this app is the best fit to the needs of OP.
