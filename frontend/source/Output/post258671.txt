Rosetta stopped working in a virtualized Snow Leopard hosted in Mavericks (Parallels or Virtualbox) <body> I have successfully installed Snow Leopard in a VirtualBox on my Macbook Pro Retina Early 2013 (running OS X Mavericks).   While I can start the virtualized Snow Leopard in Oracle's Virtualbox or Parallels, I have no luck starting any Rosetta Application from within Snow Leopard. This happens even after a fresh install of Snow Leopard before any updates. All Rosetta applications fail to start or even to be install.   Anyone know a configuration which allows using Rosetta in a virtualized Snow Leopard Environment?  The software versions I am using:  ul liVirtualbox Versions: 4.1, 5.0, 5.1/li liParallels Version: 8/li /ul  <answer260142> it turned out that the type of the hard disk I initially chose for installing Snow Leopard on matters. So, when creating the virtual hard disk drive in VirtualBox, selecting a "hdd" Parallels type file, was the key. I tried with VDI, and VMDK (VMware) but all installations with these lead to a sucessful install of Snow Leopard, but a non-functioning Rosetta.   <comment323454> Is the Mac OS X Snow Leopard the typical Desktop version or is it the Server version? <comment323465> @klanomath, I have looked at that thread, however, there is nothing specific for Rosetta mentioned therein. I mean they do not even confirm that a Rosetta application was successfully started. Nevertheless, thanks for you attention! <comment323636> @klanomath, I downloaded a trial version of Parallels 11 and unfortunately it did not work either. : ( I guess it must be related to my hardware. Maybe the Macbook Pro is the problem. <comment323641> @klanomath, I also have an Intel Core i7, my VM has 4096GB RAM. I am trying with fewer memory now. <comment323642> @elcojon I also had 4 GB RAM. Did you create a **new** VM with Snow Leo Server (I think you have to choose to install Rosetta in the OS X installer set up - I don't really remember)? <comment323643> @klanomath, You can choose to install Rosetta any time once you start a PPC application. I have tried both ways. But I haven't created a new VM, since the install consumes so much time. I guess I have to try another day. <comment325486> @klanomath, finally I got it working after are reinstall. It seems that my originally installation, which was based on Virtual Box, was performed for 32-Bits. When installing with a 64-bit OS target, all worked. <comment325488> @elcojon Well done! Please write an answer mentioning the 64-bit vs. 32-bit thing. <comment325524> @klanomath, it seems that the 64bit/32bit thing was not the only change I made in the new installation. I could further narrow down the cause in the type of hard disk type. so when creating the VM in Oracle's VirtualBox, using a vmdk, vdi, or vhd type hard disk will fail Rosetta, however, using the (Parallels) hdd type hard disk will result in a working Rosetta.
