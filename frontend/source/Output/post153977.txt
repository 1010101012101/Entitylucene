Not supported input when switching from external TV to monitor on Yosemite <body> I'm using a LogiLink Mini Display Port to HDMI adapter to connect my MacBook Pro (late 2013, 15", non-retina) to external screens - Dell monitor (through an HDMI-DVI cable) at my desk and a Samsung TV for presentations. After upgrading to Yosemite I'm having the following problem when switching displays:  ol liMy external Dell works fine as an extended monitor with its native resolution, but I need to unplug to go to a conference room/li liI plug in a Samsung LCD TV and my Mac correctly switches to mirroring view with native resolution on internal display (1440x900) and the same resolution on the TV (so it remembers my latest settings)/li liWhen switching back from a Samsung LCD TV to my external monitor, MacOSX detects it, switches back from mirroring to extended desktop (so some windows move to the second desktop), but the monitor displays a message "The current input timing is not supported by the monitor display"/li /ol  A restart helps, but I wonder if there's a better way to make OSX recognize the correct settings again?
