How can I watch iTunes HD Movies from my iMac on my HDTV? <body> I've had difficulty watching my HD iTunes Movies on an HDTV. Does anyone have a success story on how to do this? What are you using?  For some reason, my current setup fails at the HDCP (copy-protection) check that Quicktime/OS X/iTunes performs for playing all HD content. Otherwise, this setup performs all other external display functions perfectly.  The setup:  ul liA Thunderbolt-equipped iMac/li liA 720p HDTV with HDMI input (that supports HDCP)/li liA 15' mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable from Monoprice/li /ul  Obviously I'd prefer to mirror from the iMac than buy an Apple TV. Oddly, an iOS device and Apple 30 pin to HDMI works perfectly with the same HD content.  Apple support docs are pretty wishy-washy on mini DisplayPort to HDMI support. The only HDCP-supported mini DisplayPort to HDTV documentation I can find is over DVI.  <comment110059> This is just a wild guess, but a 720p TV is probably pretty old, and might not have the appropriate software/firmware for current HDCP (if at all). The iOS device might be more compatible, depending on its age.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think only 1080p TVs are sold now. <comment110098> Thanks! It is from 2010-2011, I'll see if I can update the firmware. <comment256219> Let's narrow this down. What version of OS X? What version of iTunes? What content - rented or purchased iTunes movie? <comment256298> Now on 10.11, iTunes 12, any copy-protected iTunes video content. Further troubleshooting seems to narrow this down to a combination specific to this Mac and TV, not sure if the cable actually plays a role in this as it works with the same TV on different Macs.
