There is a process called SH using 100% of my CPU <body> I checked the Activity Monitor and noticed 2 processes called codesh/code that were eating my CPU.  What apps are related to these processes and how can I stop them from eating all CPU?  <answer75098> codesh/code is a emshell/em, a program that provides a command-line interface to your computer. It can be used either interactively, or as an interpreter for script files, such as the famous periodic maintenance scripts. Some such script is likely running in this case, and may be stuck for some reason.  You should be able to find out what script that is by using strongInspect/strong on the codesh/code processes in Activity Monitor and looking at the Open Files and Ports tab. A file listed there with the .sh extension is a shell script. Its name will hopefully give you a clue as to its purpose; you can also open it as text and inspect it.   <answer273150> Know it is an old post, but in my case, when I saw high cpu usage of SH, that was a VIRUS!  I googled hours to find out this and delete.
