How to connect to tethering socks proxy? <body> I've got socks proxy server running on iPhone, it is possible via Tethering app from Emu4iOS. iPhone connected to wifi hotspot and, as I can see in tethering app, connection is active. How can I connect to this proxy from Yosemite Mac wich connected to same hotspot?  <answer164800> In "System Preferences  Network", chose your WiFi connection and in "Advanced" options at "Proxies" tab check "SOCKS Proxy" and type your server's dress and port. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/me5BS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also very important to uncheck "Use Passive FTP Mode (PASV)"
