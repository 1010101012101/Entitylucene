Automatically cc myself when sending from 1 particular email account - OSX mail <body> I've got multiple email accounts in OSX Mail, a mixture of gmail, google apps mail, and me.com ... all of which are connecting via imap / smtp.  With one of the accounts I want to automatically cc a copy of all outgoing emails to another email address.   What's the best way to do this? I can see there is a auto cc myself option under the composing tab in preferences, but this would seem to auto cc emails sent from every email account, rather than just 1 particular account.   System : OSX 10.10  <answer244587> Currently this isn't possible with the built-in  Mail rule set in Yosemite. As mentioned by user3439894, you have to rely on a third-party utility. Hereâ€™s a screenshot from Mail Act-on site.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RoVs8.png" alt="enter image description here" You can build your own rule using the additional third-party rule set e.g. Add CC Recipient. So people we see that you have added them to Cc list.  <comment300967> You're probably going to have to use a third-party utility, e.g. [Mail Act-On](https://smallcubed.com/mao/) "_Outbox rules give you the power to alter and organize the messages you send. With Act-On you can automatically CC or BCC messages depending on rule criteria._" <comment301483> Thanks although this will send a copy to another email address, it wouldnt be a cc'ed version, part of what i want to do here is enable the recipient to also see that the message was cc'ed to another person <comment301490> I have edited my previous answer.
