Not getting white boot screen background on white iPad/iPhone (iOS 7)? <body> Is this a bug I need to report or is this normal or what? On both my white iPad 2 and my white iPhone 4S running iOS 7, I thought the boot screen was supposed to be white/gray with a dark Apple logo, but I'm getting the black screen with the white logo. But since it's the same on both devices maybe I'm missing something. Any ideas?  <answer102908> The iOS boot screen prior to iOS 6 has always been a black screen with a white(-ish plus silver/gray details) Apple logo.  <answer102932> The color-specifc boot screens are only available on the iPhone 5 and later.  On these devices, the boot screen will match the colour of the front panel e.g. a white iPhone 5 will display a white screen with a black Apple logo.  <comment121132> Previously it has, but white iPhone 5(s) on iOS 7 get treated to a white boot screen with a flat Apple logo. <comment121218> I'm shocked I've never seen this before. Then again how often do you see someone else's phone boot?
