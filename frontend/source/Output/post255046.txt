Mac Mail: Reply all and keep addresses in "To" instead of "CC" <body> I use the built in Mail app on my Mac and often get e-mails directed to several recipients in the "To"-field. When I reply all, only the sender of the e-mail is set as the "To" recipient, the others are moved to the "CC"-field.   How can I change this and keep all recipients in the "To"-field when using reply all?  I'm currently on El Capitan, 10.11.6, but the same thing has happened as long as I can remember.
