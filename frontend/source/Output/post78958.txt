How do I turn a folder into a .jar file? <body> I currently have modified a program that is a code.jar/code file. I had unarchived it and turned the code.jar/code file into a folder so that I could edit it. Now all I need to do is change the folder back into a code.jar/code file so that it is not accessible like a folder. How would I do this?  <answer78964> Jar files are almost zip files in most cases, but I would use the codejar cf/code command for best results.   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html  You could just use OS X compression and then rename the zip file as .jar - but then you might not have a correct manifest file. It's hard to tell without the exact files in hand.   <answer101617> umm i tried several videos and they all said rename the file  <comment91273> What happens if you just rename it xxxxx.jar ? I've seen ML do some amazing file recognitions ... <comment91276> You add four characters to the folder name. It's still a folder and not a zipped folder stored as one file. The amazing things are when OS X launch services send a renamed file to a different path and class of files to open it. Java might be smart enough to run on a jar named folder uncompressed, but you don't have a jar file instead of a folder (no matter what it's named). <comment112494> @bmike Java can use a directory rather than a jar file - if the classpath and directory have the correct values - but this should be covered in Java tutorials <comment112495> What did you edit - the parts of a jar are compiled code and not manually editable <comment112497> @Mark Thanks for the comments here and on the question. My java-fu is weak due to atrophy. I'm probably more dangerous than knowledgable at this point. <comment119711> I suppose if your app doesn't care that nothing is compressed and the .jar folder loads this is a nice solution, but I think the asker wants to re-achive the jar since they went to the trouble to explain it was unarchived first. <comment149994> Wrong. Might also be assets. <comment149996> @Mark you could also supply your own compiled code. I assume the OP is talking about Minecraft. <comment271244> -1, this will not generate a manifest.
