How to use the mysql I just installed? <body> I have installed mysql in Mac OS X 10.6.6. However I don't know how to get to the mysql prompt.    precodeSarbbottam-Bandyopadhyays-MacBook-Pro:bin sarbbottam$ pwd   /usr/local/mysql/bin Sarbbottam-Bandyopadhyays-MacBook-Pro:bin sarbbottam$ mysql   -bash: mysql: command not found   Sarbbottam-Bandyopadhyays-MacBook-Pro:bin sarbbottam$   /code/pre  Any thoughts?  <answer8949> If you already are in the code/usr/local/mysql/bin/code directory, just launch:  precode./mysql /code/pre  You should consider adding a symbolic link to code/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql/code to the code/usr/bin/code directory.  <answer8953> An alternative for newbies (and webdevelopers) is MAMP and phpMyAdmin (that comes bundled with MAMP). Maybe worth a thought.  <comment9506> Not to /usr/bin that should be Apple software only as an upgrade can delete anything in there. Use /usr/local/bin which is already on the path <comment9509> Or just add `/usr/local/mysql/bin` to the `$PATH`. <comment9532> Thanks, I am able to log in to mysql, using $ ./mysql. I will add a symbolic link to /usr/local/bin. It will be great if you can assist me in creating the symbolic link or to update the $PATH variable, Thanks. <comment9536> Thanks, but I would like to stick to Mac default provided. Apache HTTP server, PHP is configured in my MacBook Pro. The only missing link was MySql. I am able to figure it out, with expert guidance. :) More question will follow soon ... <comment9540> Thanks all, I have created a symbolic link for /usr/local/mysql/bin to /usr/local/bin. However there was no bin directory in /usr/local. So, I have created one. $cd /usr/local; mkdir bin; ln -s /usr/local/mysql/bin mysql. Thanks everyone. <comment241509> @Sarbbottam Bandyopadhyay: Since your comment is building the correct answer, why wouldn't you write your own one? As rightly noted by Mark, to play within `/usr/bin` is **risky** (stay polite my dear :)). Crapwares do it (for example to improve your `sudo`).
