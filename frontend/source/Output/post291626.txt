How to keep an Internet Sharing connection alive with intermittent internet access? Loopback? <body> I have access to an intermittent internet connection that is typically up about 99% of the time, but every 24 hours I am faced with a bit of a difficulty.   For "Internet Sharing" OS X's default Wi-Fi behavior when a source network connection goes down is to cease the Wi-Fi sharing connection and for Airport Wi-Fi to go actively looking for a connection.   I would prefer to have the "Internet Sharing" Wi-Fi connection stay up and reachable until the source network comes back online (so in the interim I can maintain LAN access to other computers).  I have come across this write up: http://www.laszlopusztai.net/2016/02/14/creating-a-wi-fi-access-point-on-os-x/ by Laszlo Pusztai about how to create a "Loopback" network service (that never goes down because it is local) that can be shared to Wi-Fi and while this is quite interesting it only provides for access to the local network via Internet Sharing and cuts off WAN access.   I am thinking that if the Loopback service could be configured to provide DHCP and NAT services via bridging it could be a solution but I am unsure of the best way to go about that or even if such a solution would be ideal.   Does anyone have any suggestions? I've been combing over Google searches for the last coupe of days without much success.
