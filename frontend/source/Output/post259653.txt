Reveal in Finder for Photos.app? <body> I've recently taken the dive to Photos.app on Sierra and it does seem to finally replace iPhoto, but I am stuck in a rut with not being able to get to the original photos and videos via a right click and reveal in Finder function.  Is there a plugin or some option that facilitates this?  At the moment I'm having to drop to shell and issue an codelsof/code to get file paths, but that's quite cumbersome...
