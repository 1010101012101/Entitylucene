I may have used Disk Utility to erase my drive - is there hope? <body> I have an external NTFS drive from which I was trying to copy some files to my macbook pro 10.6.6.   I was getting error 36 so with disk utility I clicked on Repair Disk. Now all my data is gone!  What gives and how can I fix it?  By the way I was using Paragon NTFS as well.

If you don't see anything, you will probably have to send it to a data recovery service if you don't have a backup. brYou can also try software to recover data, like DiskWarrior.  As for why DU erased this when you clicked Repair, I have no idea. Are you sure you didn't click Erase, Reformat, or Repartition?  <answer8538> Highly recommend Get Data's Recover My Files program.  You can scan for lost files for free but must pay to save them.  However, it's a LOT cheaper than paying for professional recovery service.  <answer17660> Get the hard-drive into an external enclosure.  Preferably something with a fast interface, like FW800.  strongImage the drive./strong  Then get yourself some data rescue software (I like Data Rescue 3 -- but there are many out there), and run your recovery software on the image.  Worst case scenario is you send the hard-drive (that you've manipulated very little since you've been operating from a disk image) to a recovery centre.  <answer49727> I had the same problem, and I resolved it with the chkdsk.exe on Windows. The drive mounted and I was able to recover my files.  <comment8901> No, I didn't click on erase, I have the log form disk utility. <comment56923> Welcome to Ask Different! Could you add some detail to this answer? Where is chkdsk.exe found and how is it used? Since this is a Mac-centric site, maybe you could recommend a way to use chkdsk without access to a Windows computer?
