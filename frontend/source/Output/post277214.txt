Disk lost part of capacity after attempt of deleting windows via bootcamp assistance <body> I tried to remove the windows 10 in my macbook air using Bootcamp assistance.   When it was almost done, an error came up and told me it cant remove windows in my mac. I selected try again but this time it froze and forbid me to cancel the action. So I forced it to quit and found the bootcamp assistance no longer showing there's a windows in my mac. However, my capacity still isn't recovered.   When I restarted the macbook, I can still get into windows though its broken and can do nothing. I looked up on Disk Utility, it only shows one disk with one partition Macintosh HD. The initial space of windows is freed but I can do nothing with it.  Please help me merge it back and regain the space, thanks.
