Unable to reformat USB drive used for El Captian boot disk <body> I finally got a USB drive (PNY 128 GB) as an installer for El Capitan using instructions from Frakes' article in MacWorld. The installer seemed to work but I halted the installation process. When I went back to use the drive it was unbootable. When I tried Disk Utility to erase, it gave "unable to access the last block". How can I erase the whole drive?  <comment282017> Have you tried to erase the driver in another OS (e.g., Linux)?
