iPhone 5S 8.4 JB fast battery drain. Tried everything <body> So, I tried to fix battery drain on 8.3 and deleted a lot of tweaks. I saw that locationd stay in memory more than 5 hours ("top -o time"), etc. Then I restore to 8.4 and installed only "must-have" tweaks. So now I have a very high background time usage and battery drain very fast (120-130% in a day). Sure I disable: motion sensor, background updates, location service (locus), etc. So I tried everything. But still have a very bad time. Please help.
