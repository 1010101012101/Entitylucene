Purchase iTunes Match in countries that do not have it? <body> Can I change to the US store in iTunes and purchase iTunes Match and then after the sync switch back to Swedish store in iTunes and still have access to iTunes Match?  <answer71690> Nope, you canâ€™t. Also, you have to have a US credit card to use iTunes Match in Sweden. Even if you do find a way to sign up for iTunes Match, there will be problems.   Once you switch to the Swedish Store, you will lose access to iTunes Match.
