Is it possible to order a new Mac mini with an Nvidia graphics card? <body> This may be obvious to many , but is it possible to have a current generation Mac Mini with Nvidia graphics card option . I looked into the spec sheet on Apple website which says that it ships with AMD graphics card . I am looking for the one that has Nvidia graphics card.   I've searched over Google and did not find a plausible answer (but I'm a bit rushed and may have mislooked the answer).  <answer59067> If you want to purchase a Mac Mini with Nvidia Graphics, you'll have to buy an older one with Core 2 Duo processors.  The current Mac mini with Sandy Bridge Processors (i5, i7) only ships with AMD graphics.  For more information check out Wikipedia's summary of Mac Mini specifications here and here.  <answer59111> No you can't order the current generation Mac Mini Mid-2011 with anything other than what Apple will offer to you as a build to order option for graphcis.  strongCurrently the only options for graphics on the Mac Mini are:/strong  ul liIntel HD Graphics 3000/li liAMD Radeon HD 6630M/li /ul  Recall from iFixit's Mac Mini tear down that the Mac Mini is a highly integrated machine, and there really is no such thing as a "graphics card" in it, its a graphics chip set on the motherboard as pictured below from iFixit, what Apple puts on it is what you have to choose from.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6OCub.jpg" alt="There is your Graphics"  However, with the Availability of Thunderbolt there is opportunity for expensive external graphics options on Mac Mini's with Thunderbolt. Products such as the Sonnet Echo Express offer external PCI express x4 speed slots, but as of yet there are not listed graphics card that are compatible.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FOZbX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment68073> Thanks , it may be offtopic ... is there anything in the PC world equivalent to mac mini having nvidia graphics card .
