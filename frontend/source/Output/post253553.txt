How to turn off multilingual typing without deleting dictionaries or keyboards in iOS 10? <body> This wasn't a problem in iOS 9 or earlier. However, now iOS 10 has added a new feature such that one doesn't have to switch keyboards to type in another language, which emcauses trouble/em: now I have both English and French dictionaries and both keyboards, and for example, when I type "critique" in the English keyboard, a word existing in both dictionaries, iOS will then prompt the French suggestions (de, le, la etc.), even though I never mean to switch to French -- I just want to normally type "critique" as an English word, but of course iOS can't detect my intention.  Anyway, now I want things to go back to what they were in iOS 9 or earlier. And I have to keep both the dictionaries and the keyboards. Is it possible?  <comment315546> Try adding another keyboard but no dictionary for it.  I think I saw somewhere that more than two may leave English unbothered by the feature. <comment315558> @TomGewecke well that doesn't seem to work for me.. anyway let's hope it'll be fixed in later versions. <comment315653> I think I should have written WITH the dictionary.  I have multiple keyboards and dictionaries and the English keyboard seems to stick to English. <comment315700> @TomGewecke I have Chinese, French and English keyboards. Each with its own dictionary, and even additional ones such as French-English or Chinese-English, English-Chinese. <comment340352> the definitions dictionaries have nothing to do with autocorrect. no idea why people think that they are related. <comment340359> @lensovet yeah. And it seems that the cross-language issue persists. <comment340361> AFAIK there's no way to turn this off. A bunch of my friends get hilarious autocorrects because of this.
