Finder tag not working for all folders <body> I set the codered/code tag for the folder code~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/code but if I search all files or folders with the codered/code tag, this doesn't show up.  <answer170607> Probably need to search 'System files - are included'.br Regular search may not look in there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQuhQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment200593> Still doesn't work. I have `xtraFinder` installed, could it be the problem? I even tried [this](https://github.com/jdberry/tag) but it still not showing up. <comment200594> I don't have Xcode any more, but still have Command Line Tools folder in that location. Works for me with that as a search term - updating my picture to reflect that [& confirmed it won't find it without 'system files'] <comment200685> Under System Preferences  Spotlight  Search Results tab, is Developer checked? <comment200796> @tubedogg, yes. <comment229889> It still doesn't work for me.
