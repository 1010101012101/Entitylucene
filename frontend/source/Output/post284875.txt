Activity Monitor show UserEventAgent %CPU 59.3, launchd %CPU 57.2 <body> After I turn on the MacBook Air, it gets very hot, the battery discharges very fast (in about three hours) and the fan does not stop working.This started twenty-seven days ago. I think this is caused by launchd and UserEventAgent.

This was not before. I think this is caused by launchd and UserEventAgent. <comment359334> did try you reinstalling OS X yet? <comment359335> IronCraftMan No, I have not tried it. Reinstalling OS X is the same as formatting? <comment359391> no. Reinstalling OS X does not delete any data. Just restart into Recovery mode and reinstall. <comment359412> IronCraftMan I already reinstalled it. Everything remains the same, except there is something else in system.log: Permission denied: /var/root/Library/dorn/dorn <comment359532> I finally solved it, erasing first and then reinstalling.
