Make JSON files to have TextMate2 icon <body> I have all the emJSON/em files on my system set to open with TextMate 2. When I get Info on one of these em.js/em files, I see the TextMate 2 icon on the corner. But, how do I make for the TextMate icon to appear while in Finder's icon mode too?  I'm using Mountain Lion, if that makes any difference.  <answer89247> You must go to settings - icons settings - set files icons.  <answer89254> Select any .js file and press "Command+i". Go to "Open with". Select TextMate 2 from the drop down and click "Change all".  Now you can see the TM icons in finder.  <comment104664> The tm2 icon in the corner is "The Icon From Textmate" <comment104665> What do they currently show? <comment104670> Which application are you referring to here? <comment104685> system preferences or finder?
