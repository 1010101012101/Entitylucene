Alert for calendar events it working properly <body> When I try to set up an alert for a calendar event, it doesn't work properly.  The problem is when I try to set up a second alert.  The first alert goes fine, but say I want to set up a second alert for the same event, such as one being for 2 hours before event, the second being for 1/2 hour before event, it won't let me set them in the proper sequence.  The first alert will set up, but the second alert always goes before the first, no matter how I try to set it up.  So, I'll end up with the first alert being for 1/2 hour before the event, and the second alert being for 2 hours before the event. Nothing I do chances the sequence.  Sorry for such a long description.
