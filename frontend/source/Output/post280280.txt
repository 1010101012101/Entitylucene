What Makes an macOS "Package" Show as a Package? <body> A package is just a directory, apparently, but somehow Finder and Path Finder know it's a package.   How is this indicated in the file system? I've tried a few changes to a directory to make it a package but to no avail.  <answer280319> strongShort answer/strong  To register a document as a package, the developer of DayOne would have had to modify the document type information in the DayOne app's information property list (Info.plist) file.  strongLong Answer/strong  A empackage/em is a file system directory used by macOS and iOS. It's basically a directory that will emappear/em as a single file, but which may in fact contain a preserved state of files and folders. So, a folder could have a number of subfolders and many files, but as a package it will be displayed to users like a single file. For example, in macOS the Finder will see a package as a single file to avoid users mucking around with the actual  contents. However, users can view the contents through various methods such as right-clicking on the package and selecting Show Package Contents from the context menu.  Apple's emBundle Programming Guide/em, available on their Developer site, has a whole section on Document Packages. Below are some relevant quotes:     To register a document as a package, you must modify the document type   information in your application’s information property list   (codeInfo.plist/code) file. The codeCFBundleDocumentTypes/code key stores information   about the document types your application supports. For each document   package type, include the codeLSTypeIsPackage/code key with an appropriate   value. The presence of this key tells the Finder and Launch Services   to treat directories with the given file extension as a package. For   more information about codeInfo.plist/code keys, see Information Property List   Key Reference.      Document packages should always have an extension to identify   them—even though that extension may be hidden by the user. The   extension allows the Finder to identify your document directory and   treat it as a package. You should never associate a document package   with a MIME type or 4-byte OS type.

Although @Monomeeth's answer is right, but dealing with GUI is a lot better than codeInfo.plist/code. People usually use another path. They strongsubclass/strong codeNSDocment/code, which provides the basis for file/bundle saving and loading. Then, people go to Xcode and under the "General" tab, define a document type, then go to "Exported UTIs" and export an UTI that conforms to codecom.apple.package/code. They read in with the codeNSFileWrapper/code class. This way, people won't have to do some tedious work with stuff like codeNSData/code.  If you want to create a bundle, check this answer. Simply create an empty macOS app and edit the "Exported UTIs" sections to taste.  <comment352513> call it something.app or something.photoslibrary etc. There are many versions <comment352516> @Tetsujin you're correct that it's in the filename. which I did not know. But yet DayOne app has managed to register .dayone as a package type. So... how can that be done for new pathnames? Thanks! <comment352518> Sorry, that will need someone smarter than me, I'm afraid ;) <comment352519> Thanks... well if you want to add an answer to this question even given just what you've given so far, that would be great. Thanks. <comment352523> I'd wait for one of the smarter cookies - there's bound to be one along shortly :) <comment352526> You said, "_I've tried a few changes to a directory to make it a package but to no avail._", well what did you try?  Also, have a look at, [Package (macOS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_(macOS)) and [Bundle (macOS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_(macOS)). <comment352533> @user3439894 it seems to be name dependent, particularly keying on the file extension, as other commenters point out. <comment352604> @Tetsujin Haha, I just saw your comment. I've offered an answer, but in no way do I claim to be smarter than you! :) <comment352620> @Monomeeth - horses for courses... I'm ***great*** at the really, really easy questions :P
