Is there a way for SSHFS mounted drives to show up in Shared in Finder Sidebar <body> When I mount a remote drive using Samba, it shows up in my finder sidebar in the shared section along with an eject button.  Is there a way for drives mounted through SSHFS to show up in the same shared section?  I know I can have the drives visible on my Desktop and eject with a keyboard shortcut. I want the aforementioned specific behavior for other reasons.
