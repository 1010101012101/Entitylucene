How to turn off iPhone without power button? <body> My iPhone's power button is broken. How can I still turn it off to send it in for repairs? I found another answer, but it does not really help.  <answer73758> If you go to SettingsGeneralAccessibilityAssistiveTouch and flip the switch to "on," you will find a black square with a white dot in the middle.  When you tap the white circle for AssistiveTouch, tap "Device," then LONG PRESS on the "Lock Screen" option.  You should be set!  <comment85708> Very good workaround! This works for me! <comment86008> I had this switched on but never tried the long press! Awesome! <comment154994> related: To turn it back on, plug in the computer cable.
