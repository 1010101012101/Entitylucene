EDIT: And as usual, as soon as I post a problem report, I somehow manage to fix it :)      What I just did now was log into iCloud.com and I made a tiny edit to one of my notes (in my case, I deleted one line on a to-do list). Then I waited a few seconds for the data to refresh, and then I tried opening Notes locally again.      Let us know if this works.   <answer255131> I faced a similar Notes app crash, few days after upgrading to Sierra. The problem occurred exactly when I tried to disable(remove) an auto-enabled HTTP link from one of my checklist items. The app worked well when I was offline but crashed as soon as I was online.  The solution proposed by 'sevenfourk' above helped me. I changed some text in the iCloud Notes, refreshed and launched the app locally again. Although a bit ad-hoc this solution seems to have worked and the problem clearly seems to be related to iCloud syncing.  <answer256936> Turn off notes on your mac (in iCloud preferences) Launch the App (you should find it blank - no notes) Quit the app turn notes back on in preferences then launch notes app  Worked for me..  <answer258866> strongTry the below steps.

This is why macOS Sierra has many system changes compared with earlier systems. The best way is, create an USB installer and make a clean install. This will solve most of the current problems. **Don't forget to make a backup!** <comment317257> hey man, had similar issues with that.  firsthand I had this on iOS, not sure if that was reproduced only after iOS 10 upgrade.  then today I discovered this on macOS.  I think this is due to some weird symbols or something like that, I've moved my notes to g-docs and notes are no longer crashing.  but anyway, having it's so annoying. it's supposed to just work. <comment317261> @dante12, your suggestion is odd.  your saying this like macOS is like some windows and had to be re-installed after all major re-leases. macOS is not supposed to work like that.  I tend to believe that that crash is linked with the error message it actually shows:  **Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'CKException', reason: 'data can not be nil'** <comment317281> Try disable iCloud Notes in settings. Open Notes, enable iCloud Notes again. <comment321359> this remove all your local notes - and then need download it again - bad choice
