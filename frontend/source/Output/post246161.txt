How do I prevent my Mac from autocorrecting my username? <body> Every time I try to login with my usual username (i.e. strongg/strongsamaras), I get a pop-up, like a suggestion from my Mac, for the word emsamaras/em, so unless I click on the x button, "gsamaras" will be replaced by "samaras".  How can I tell my Mac not to correct gsamaras?  Note: Formatting the laptop is not an option.  <answer246165> Type your name, right click and pick "Learn Spelling".   <answer246166> You can add the word to your dictionary or you can disable auto correct. Go up to Edit - Spelling and Grammar, then untick Correct Spelling Automatically.   <comment303425> When you say "login," do you mean logging into your Mac itself or into Ask Different? <comment303426> Once logged in, can you try this: Open text edit, type your name, right click  and pick "Learn Spelling". Maybe that will add it to a system wide dictionary? Also, maybe try to have it Learn Spelling from the login screen? <comment303427> @joels I don't believe it's a system dictionary, but rather a user-specific one (it's inside ~/Library). However, if this need only apply to one user account, that should probably suffice. <comment303434> I mean when logging into my email for example, sorry! @joels that did the trick, I suggest you post an answer! :)
