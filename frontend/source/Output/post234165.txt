OS X will not update past 10.11 <body> I am currently enrolled in the public beta for OS X.  I have OS X El Capitan 10.11 beta (15A278b). When I sent my feedback through the Feedback Assistant, I could not even select this build in the dropdown (I could only choose between 15E65 and 15F18c).  I have not received any updates to the later versions of OS X. App Store currently has no updates for my machine (everything is apparently up to date).  I thought about opting out of the public beta, but the option does not appear in System Preference  App Store (the section with the "Change" button is missing).  I downloaded OS X 10.11.4 from Apple's web site, but it tells me "OS X El Capitan Update can't be installed on this disk. This volume does not meet the requirements for this update."  I did not find someone else with the same issue. I want to avoid having to restore my Mac.  I'm on a 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro (late 2013).  <answer234171> Turns out I had the GM version installed. I downloaded the standard OS X from the App Store, installed it, and everything is fine now.  <comment286277> Are you able to download the El Capitan installer from the App Store? <comment286278> I did not think of this. From what I see, the only one available in the "Purchased" tab is "OS X El Capitan GM Candidate." I've gone ahead and started downloading it. I'll comment when it is done. <comment286285> Issue resolved. <comment286401> I will. Ask Different is telling me to wait for tomorrow.
