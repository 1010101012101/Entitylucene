How do I disable autorun when I plug in a USB? <body> I have a mobile Internet stick that is connected through the USB. The annoying part is that the connection program automatically launches when I plug it in.  I prefer to connect to the Internet using the Network Preferences, look for the USB modem device, then click Connect. Well, of course, I already have the modem device icon up in the menu bar, so there's no need to open any additional windows.  strongHow do I disable autorun when I plug in a USB?/strong  Bonus points if I could disable autorun for this particular USB stick.  <comment90022> It's probably because your connection program runs in background. Try quitting it. <comment90068> @MatthieuRiegler, do you mean it's running in the background even before I plug in the USB? (it probably installed some app the first time I used it) <comment91139> Yep, that's my presumption.
