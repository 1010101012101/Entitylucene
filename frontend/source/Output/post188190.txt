Uninstall rEFInd 0.8-3.7 on Yosemite <body> I recently tried installing rEFInd on Yosemite using the command code./install.sh --alldrivers/code however it would not recognise the ubuntu 14.04 x64 for Mac disk I made and so I would like to uninstall rEFInd.  I have tried removing rEFInd from the EFI directory, however the EFI directory does not exist. How do I uninstall rEFInd 0.8-3.7 using OS X 10.10.3?  strongEdit/strongbr Here are my drives if this helps (found using codediskutil list/code  pre /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            235.1 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data Linux                   15.0 GB    disk0s4 /pre  Ignore codedisk0s4/code because I am going to remove it (that is where my Linux partition would have been)  <answer188316>    strongNote: El Capitan (OS X 10.11) prevents users from selecting rEFInd and common Linux distributions from the Startup Disk pane./strong The new preferred method is to install rEFInd into the an EFI partition. My answer, to an unrelated question, outlines this new preferred method to start the rEFInd Boot Manager and Linux operating systems. The answer, given below, applies to Yosemite (OS X 10.10) and possibly earlier versions of OS X.    Personally, I installed rEFInd on my computer to its own partition. This prevents the problems you are encountering. Everything code./install.sh/code installed went to this partition. If I want to remove rEFInd, I can simply erase or remove the partition. Of course both are unnecessary, because I can turn rEFInd on and off at will. I just go to the Startup window in System Preferences select my boot partition. This computer has OS X, Windows, Fedora and rEFInd installed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c8kqZ.png" alt="2"  I also can select the boot partition under Windows by using BootCamp and by holding the Option key down at startup. The command codediskutil list/code produces:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Marlin                  300.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data Coelacanth              98.9 GB    disk0s4    5:                  Apple_HFS Linux HFS+ ESP          209.7 MB   disk0s5    6: 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4               524.3 MB   disk0s6    7:                  Linux LVM                         98.6 GB    disk0s7    8:                  Apple_HFS rEFInd                  939.5 MB   disk0s8 /code/pre  Note, the rEFInd partition is ~ 1 GB in size. In fact, it can be as small as 100 MB. When I setup this computer, I used the Disk Utility application to create the rEFInd partition. If I would have used the codegpt/code command, I could have created a smaller partition. Neither OS X, Windows, Fedora nor rEFInd use the EFI partition to boot the computer. In fact, there is nothing useful in the EFI partition.  h2Answer to your questions:/h2  strongHow do I uninstall rEFInd 0.8-3.7 using OS X 10.10.3?/strong Read the code./install.sh/code file and undo whatever it did. I should of had you run the commands codebless --info/code and codebless --info  --getBoot/code. These would have told where the code.efi/code file was stored. Note: Almost everyone installs rEFInd to the OS X boot partition.  strongHow would I go and reinstall it using different options if I cannot remove it?/strong The author of the software never said rEFInd could not be removed. I suggested you just install it again to its own partition. This might be a good place to mention the codegpt/code command has to be run while either booted to an external recover partition or while booted to internet recovery.  strongCould I simply remove the EFI partition or would that corrupt my Mac?/strong Do not remove the EFI partition! It is not used to boot OS X, but it is used by OS X for emother/em things.    <answer258723> precodediskutil list | grep EFI | awk '{print $6}' /code/pre  This will only output the lines of containing the string "efi" and of that line, only the 6th column, so the output is:  precodedisk0s1 /code/pre  You already did this part it looks like your EFI disk is disk0s1  precodesudo mkdir /Volumes/efi sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi sudo rm -rfP /Volumes/efi/EFI/refind  sudo bless --setBoot --mount / /code/pre  <comment222767> The author of rEFInd recommends not to uninstall, but rather to bypass it. See [Uninstalling rEFInd from OS X](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#uinst_osx). <comment222768> If rEFInd did not work, then how are you booting ubuntu.? <comment222772> @DavidAnderson I said I cannot dual boot it. because it wouldn't boot into the disk. I am now running it on Virtual Box <comment222773> @DavidAnderson that bypass worked for me. How would I go and reinstall it using different options if I cannot remove it? Could I simply remove the EFI partition or would that corrupt my Mac? <comment222840> I'm going to do what you did. Insta rEFInd onto another partition. To remove it I am reinstalling OS X. Also what is the EFI partition used for? <comment235833> Adding this here on behalf of @Jerry http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/137606/jerry    "Your OS setup sounds great. Do you mind sharing a little more about creating the rEFInd partition and setup? I would like to avoid rEFInd from becoming the primary bootloader." <comment341513> "I have tried removing rEFInd from the EFI directory, however the EFI directory does not exist." You have to mount the EFI partition into a directory, first. This is what the answer of davidcondrey does.
