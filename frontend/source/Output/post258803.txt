Telling the terminal to nohup an application when opening it <body> I installed gedit on Mac OS X El Capitan, and I have added it to the dock.  The problem is whenever I click on its icon on the dock, it opens a terminal window to spawn the process.  If I close the terminal window (which I have a habit of doing when the window is just sitting there and I'm not using it), gedit crashes.  So I want to change the setup, so that when I click on the gedit icon, instead of running the codegedit/code command, the terminal will run codenohup gedit &amp;/code.  Is there any way I can do this?
