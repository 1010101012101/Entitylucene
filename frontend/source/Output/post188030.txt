How do I take a screenshot of an active phone call without hanging up? <body> I'm trying to take a screenshot of the "hard-pause" dialing feature. If you put a semicolon after a phone number you can provide, for example, a conference line pass-code as part of a phone number.  precode1-800-123-4567;987654# /code/pre  The call screen then shows a little clickable label in the bottom left-hand side of the call screen to appear  precodeDial "9876..." /code/pre  I try to screenshot that, but pressing the home button causes the call to end and I get a screenshot of the hanging up call screen.  <answer188031> Use Assistive Touch, available from Settings → Accessibility → Assistive Touch.  Enable the feature using the switch, then take a screenshot by pressing the Assistive Touch button, then Device → More → Screenshot.  <answer195810> If you have a Mac you could use QuickTime Player?

From there make the call and screenshot it on the Mac.
