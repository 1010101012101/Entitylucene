X29 Proximity Temperature sensor <body> What is the X29 Proximity (temperature) Sensor measuring? I'm on a 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina.  <answer247380> The X29 Proximity Temperature sensor is used to monitor the heat that the CPU is producing, likely at different locations inside the computer, hence the word emproximity/em.  <comment305258> How does this differ from the "CPU analog" and "CPU digital" sensors? <comment305259> @lightbord My guess is that the name "proximity sensor" means that it measures CPU heat at different proximities.
