Early 2011 MacBook Pro does not standby correctly <body> My Early 2011 15" MBP non-retina will not enter standby mode correctly. Meaning, when inactive for a few minutes, rather than just turning off the display, it goes into sleep mode, causing network shares to disconnect.  I have the Energy Saver settings set to never sleep while on power  This is a big problem for me, since I use NAS shares to store much of my work.  Is there a way to eitherbr A) Disable sleep mode while plugged in (because usually when I need the shares up I'm plugged in) ORbr B) Configure macOS to keep AFP shares connected while in sleep mode  I am running 10.13 High Sierra Beta  <answer296219> This Support Page at Apple does not specify your MBP as fulfilling the hardware requirements for using Standby mode:  precode•   MacBook (2015 and later) •   MacBook Pro (2012 and later) •   MacBook Air (2010 and later) •   SSD and Fusion drive versions of Mac mini (2012 and later) •   SSD and Fusion drive versions of iMac (2012 and later) •   Mac Pro (Late 2013) /code/pre  <comment374156> Then why is my MBP going to full sleep mode when I have it set Never to Sleep?
