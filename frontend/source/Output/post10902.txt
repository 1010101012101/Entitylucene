Application level volume control in OS X? <body> I recently switched from PC to Mac and one thing I miss is Windows' application-level volume control (i.e. mute Firefox, turn up iTunes, turn down Skype etc). How can I achieve the same on a Mac? Or better yet, I want volume settings based on location (using HTTP location API or WiFi network name) and time of day or day of week etc.  <answer10904> strongDetour/strong is no longer under development, and doesn't work in MacOSX 10.5+  strongHear/strong is a rather expensive utility ($49.95) and has a number of other audio "Pro" features.  strongJack/strong is a low-latency audio server written originally for GNU/Linux and I believe can change volume on a per-application basis. And it's free.  <answer90359> SoundBunny ($9.99) also provides this function. Supports 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8  SoundBunny by Prosoft Engineering  Update: As pointed out below by Steve Moser SoundBunny cannot change the volume of Sandboxed applications.  <answer90887> On mac, with i tunes the command is cmd and the UP arrow, this also works for divx, vlc ext, with the internet, just use the volume controls F11 / F12.   No need to spend monies on silly apps!  <answer124503> While focused on the app.. OS X Mavericks:   Command+option+up/down arrows  <answer154270> I use Butler &amp; USB Overdrive to setup key commands and map media keys (play/pause/skip back+fwd/volume/mute) to control iTunes &amp; Spotify, as well as other system wide controls.  Regular in-app key commands can be setup in the emMac OS System Prefs - Keyboard - Application Shortcuts/em. While these will give you more control via key commands when you're working in the app, they won't work if the specified app is in the background. So if you want to change the volume of iTunes or Spotify, skip tracks, or pause while you are working in another app, these 2 apps will allow you to do that. Both apps provide built-in basic itunes controls, but I had to use Applescript to control Spotify. Here are some Applescript examples that can be used for these types of functions in both of these apps:  alvinalexander.com/apple/itunes-applescript-examples-scripts-mac-reference [the form wouldn't let me submit more than 2 links so i had to make this inactive]  <answer188055> Here's a possible strongworkaround/strong, for a strongsubset/strong of use cases, that doesn't require any new software.  We use Slack at work, and I like to play iTunes kinda loud (in my headphones).  Sometimes I was missing Slack audible "bings".  Just fyi that you can set iTunes volume lower in the iTunes UI, and then set the overall system volume in upper right system menu reasonably high, so that relatively the non-iTunes notifications will be noticeable.  Basically:  ul liiTunes volume can bet set independently of other sounds, WITHIN the iTunes UI/li liAnd then the overall volume in the upper right controls the combination of everything./li /ul  I suspect this works in other apps that have an independent volume control.  Note: I see some possibly similar answers with negative votes, but I've taken the time to explain how it works, and clearly disclosed that it's a subset/workaround to what was asked, so please don't ding me for this answer.  This is one of those things that's "obvious" to gurus, but not obvious to the rest of the folks using Mac.  <answer197229> Just found http://volumemixer-app.com/ it's very similar to the one found on windows.  <answer205481> Control+Command+Up/Down Arrows works for me Mac OS 10.9.5  <answer235358> A free open source one if you don't want to pay for VolumeMixer is this one: https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic  <answer261770> If you have xcode installed, you can use BackgroundMusic.  XCode is required to build the binaries.  https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic  <answer293118> I just figured out how to do this on macOS Sierra. I was playing Roblox, and I wanted to watch a YouTube video in the background, but mute Roblox. So I tried using Siri and just saying "Mute Roblox" did the trick. I honestly didn't believe that it would work, but there you are.  <comment106709> That's not what was asked. <comment106815> +1 for a great app. It also comes with a 30-day free trial. <comment106816> FYI - I'm not aware of any way to control volume on a tab-level. <comment111603> Sadly it looks like it doesn't support sandboxed apps. http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/reviews/?reviewid=3443759&pn=1 <comment145655> In which applications does this work? <comment149153> There's an alternative UI for Jack by the name of [QjackCtl](http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/). A compiled binary can be fetched [here](http://www.matthiaskronlachner.com/?p=1700). <comment181567> This does not provide an answer to the question.

Suck. <comment274334> Doesn't address the actual question, this is just how to adjust the overall Mac volume. <comment274335> Maybe it's changed, but I'm seeing Hear is $19.99.  May give it a try since SoundBunny apparently won't work with an external audio interface. <comment279238> And it's expensive! <comment328369> Also asked on SU - http://superuser.com/q/150304/978 <comment333257> Will not install with Mavericks Xcode.  =( <comment333392> Did you copy and paste the install code from their Readme? <comment333433> Yes, first I am greeted by `WARNING: Your version of Xcode (6.2) may not be recent enough to build Background Music.` and when I accept this and run anyway, it fails with `ERROR: Install failed at line 196 with the message:   A build command failed. Probably a compilation error.   Failed command:                             sudo /usr/bin/xcodebuild -project BGMDriver/BGMDriver.xcodeproj -target Background Music Device -configuration Release RUN_CLANG_STATIC_ANALYZER=0 DSTROOT=/ clean install` <comment333590> Oh incidentally, I could not get Jack to do any volume controls at all, only audio routing.  It doesn't seem to me that it can do any per-application volume control, but if anyone knows differently I'd love to be pointed to instructions, I was unable to find any. <comment334768> It's a long way behind `master`, but we have a branch [10.9Support](https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic/tree/10.9Support) that I think should build with Xcode 6.2. IIRC, app volumes should work on that branch. You could also try passing `OTHER_CFLAGS="-Wno-error"` to `xcodebuild`, which turns off warnings-as-errors.
