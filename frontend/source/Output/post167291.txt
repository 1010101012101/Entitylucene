Suddenly Apple Wired Keyboard not working <body> Suddenly my wired Apple Keyboard isn't working anymore. My MacBook don't recognize the external keyboard, and the keyboard is only two weeks old.  Is the Keyboard physically broken, or is it a software issue?  What can I do to fix it?  <answer168016> I resolved my issue by following the SMC Reset instructions here.  Basically unplug everything, power down the mac, hold the power button for 5 seconds. Once the system has rebooted then reattached all peripherals. Then my keyboard started working again.  Kieran   <answer169984> I had a similar problem. Brand new iMac that refused to detect my wired keyboard.  After a lot of experimenting, I resolved the problem by removing my bluetooth keyboard from the bluetooth devices list completely and then plugging in the wired keyboard.  ul liOpen System Preferences and select “Bluetooth”/li liA list of the devices detected (both paired and unpaired) will appear./li liHover your mouse to the right of any connected bluetooth keyboard and press the codex/code that appears, to remove it from the list completely./li liFinally, connect your wired keyboard and hopefully emvoila/em. For me, everything returned to normal./li /ul  <answer178568> Since February 2015, I've had this happen to me twice. Mac refusing to recognize wired keyboard (new mac keyboard received at Xmas). Holding down power button 5 sec after rebooting works for me, but this should be happening at all! Disabled Bluetooth, removed all connections as well  <answer179299> This is what solved it for me:     Eventually I found this thread on the Apple website, and followed the rather bizarre advice of adding a USB extension cable between the keyboard and the Mac (luckily the keyboard comes packaged with one). Bingo! Keyboard fine, mouse plugged into it also fine.   suphttp://www.zigpress.com/2014/12/30/has-your-apple-mac-external-usb-keyboard-stopped-working//sup  <answer181944> I just had this on a box-fresh macbook pro. Sigh. This was the only thing that worked for me:  To reset the SMC:  ol liShut down the computer. Plug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your computer./li liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time./li liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li liPress the power button to turn on the computer./li /ol  Source: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295  h1Update/h1  Actually, using the USB extension lead is all that works now. Reproducibly weird.  <answer201163> I think the problem is that the keyboard draws so little current that it won´t wake the port if you have the Apple keyboard with a usb hub.   Just stick a usb memorystick in the keyboard and re-insert the cable. If it works then just remove the memorystick or what ever you put in (doesn´t matter what).   <answer205527> On my iMac the wired keyboard quit working—I checked the USB ports, which all worked. I tried the keyboard on my MacBook, which worked. Then I read this blog. The restart didn't work but as a last resort I tried the USB extension and to my surprise, the keyboard works again.  <answer205696> Just tried adding a usb memory stick fix, and it worked. I can't believe I am having to do this, why can't apple recognise that it is a problem.  <answer205715> I have a usb hub attached to the kyboard, and the keyboard plugged directly into my imac. I tried adding a usb extension cable between the keyboard and imac, but the usb hub light kept blinking and the keyboard wouldn't work. I removed the extension cable. Now the usb hub light didn't even blink. I unplugged and replugged the keyboard a few times, and on one of the atempts it started working again. No idea exactly what's going on. wiggling the usb connections doesn't work, so it doesn't seem to be a loose connection -- the connector actually has to be unplugged for a few seconds and then plugged back in for it to work.  <comment197267> I will try it and inform you if it helped. <comment198868> This worked for me http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295, thanks! <comment211508> This does not really answer the question.

Utterly bizarre! <comment242458> Of course, you should never connect a keyboard via a USB Hub in the first place, connect the Hub to the keyboard if you need to chain them. <comment249227> This is what solved it for me. Apple products are becoming less and less reliable. <comment249253> USB extension worked for me as well! <comment255963> @xyNNN This should be the accepted answer. <comment265400> This worked for me - how simple. Thanks!!! <comment265499> This solved it for me, too. However, if I now try to plug it directly it still wouldn't work. Is there a workaround, so I don't have to plug the keyboard with the extension every time? <comment279502> This answer gave me the idea to remove my existing extension cable, and voila. Close enough. +1 <comment283381> I can confirm that charging your cell phone via one of the USB ports on the keyboard will also resolve things. <comment299058> Using the USB extension fixed it immediately for me. <comment309036> @Tetsujin why should you not plug a keyboard into a hub? It seems counterintuitive to put the keyboard as a bottleneck when you have a powered hub. <comment309037> It's always been 'standard practise' to not put important or time-sensitive devices behind a hub. Frankly I've no idea why, technically, but I always keep my keyboard & my audio i/o on their own ports; everything else can share an 8-way hub. <comment328154> @xyNNN this should be the accepted answer. I had exactly the same problem with a keyboard that would not be detected reliably through either the MacBook ports or my Thunderbolt display ports. Plugging something into the keyboard port solved the problem. <comment341135> It worked for me! So silly....
