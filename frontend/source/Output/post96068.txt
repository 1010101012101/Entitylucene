How do I enter "ř" (small R with caron) and other unusual special characters on the iPhone? <body> I have a Czech friend whose name is Jiří, and I want to add his name to my Contacts.  Pressing and holding R on the iPhone keyboard does not show any special character versions (and similarly on OSX, holding R doesn't show anything.  I found the character in Special Characters on OSX.)  How can I add his name to my iPhone contacts?  More generally, how do you get access to general special characters on the iPhone?  I don't know of any Special Characters equivalent app or functionality accessible through the keyboard, but I would guess there must be a way somehow.  <answer96070> That character is not accessible from the English iPhone keyboard. You can, however, enable other keyboards on your iPhone.  Under the strongSettings/strong app, go to strongGeneral/strong then strongKeyboards/strong and select the strongKeyboards/strong control. You can then touch strongAdd New Keyboard…/strong and add the Czech keyboard as an option.  When typing, if you want to access thekbdř/kbd key, hold down the globe key on the bottom row of the keyboard, select the Czech layout, and then when you press and hold kbdr/kbd, you get the menu wherein you can select the ř.  If you frequently need Czech accents, keep the Czech keyboard installed. If this is a rare occurrence, you can then uninstall the Czech keyboard from strongSettings/strong » strongGeneral/strong » strongKeyboards/strong » strongKeyboards/strong.  hr  The easier way to access the ř character on a one-time basis would be to visit emthis page/em with your iPhone, copy the ř character, and then paste it into your friend's Contact information.  <answer96101> For general access to special characters on iOS devices there are also various apps like Unicode Pad and Cymbol.  Some characters cannot be found on any keyboard.  <comment112814> Thanks Daniel - I never thought of adding another keyboard. Re the one-time basis - yes, I thought of that, or sending myself an email with the character, etc... but I was sure there had to be a better way! Especially if I'm not at home and don't have my Mac handy. <comment112815> The fact that you typed the character in the question means you had *some* way of producing it :-) <comment112816> Yes - but it took until I got home and was at my computer to do so! Once I'm there I might as well add the contact manually and sync. I figured there *had* to be a way to do it on the phone itself.
