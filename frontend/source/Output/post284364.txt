IPhone 6+ Touch ID sensitivity <body> I swear there is some difference in Touch ID sensitivity between unlocking the phone and apps that use Touch ID. I would say 85% of the time I try to unlock my phone with Touch ID it fails. It fails multiple times in a row and forces me to type my passcode. However, when I use any of my banking apps that use Touch ID, they work 90% of the time.   Am I crazy, or is there a difference in the sensitivity?  <comment358600> I'd try deleting your thumbprints and then re-store them.   I hated touch ID until someone suggested trying that.  At the time apps couldn't yet use touch ID, so I can't tell you if there was different behavior with apps.
