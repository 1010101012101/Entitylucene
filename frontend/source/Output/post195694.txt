How can I change 'history' command output? <body> So by default .bash_history stores em500/em last used commands. I changed that to em5000/em by setting codeHISTFILESIZE=5000/code in code.bash_profile/code It seems to work.  Now when I do codehistory/code it still prints strong500/strong commands, but now it does so strongnot/strong from strong1 to 500/strong, but from strong36 to 535/strong (earlier commands are stored but not printed).   I'd like for codehistory/code to print em1000/em last used commands. How can I achieve that?  Also recently I tried codehistory -a/code and haven't noticed anything change. What does this command do? Man history doesn't help.  <answer195708> In addition to codeHISTFILESIZE/code, you also need to set codeHISTSIZE/code, which controls the number of commands to keep in memory until they are saved.  Also, the manual page for codehistory/code is available via codeman bash/code.  Scroll down to codeSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS/code, and you'll find it.  The details about codeHISTSIZE/code and other variables are further up in the same manual page.
