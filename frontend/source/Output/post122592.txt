Get short link of a trello board/card on iPhone <body> I have a Trello app on iPhone, and I want to share the link of a Trello board/card with my friends via whatsapp. But I can't find this anyway in the iPhone app.  Any idea where I can look for it?  <comment143107> Have you tired the ComputerBrowser version? Ist there any Link which you can copy? <comment143122> @SomeOneWhoNeedsHELP-TY, well... not too sure what is the relevancy of your comment to my question. I am asking about iOS native app which is obviously different from web browser app
