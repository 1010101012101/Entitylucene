Which carriers will my unlocked AT&T iPhone 4s work with? <body> I purchased a subsidized AT&amp;T iPhone 4s in October 2011 (model MC922LL/A). I just unlocked the phone through AT&amp;T's unlock website and received an email confirmation. I have backed up and restored the phone in iTunes and received the "Congratulations, your iPhone has been unlocked" message.  My question is, can I use my unlocked iPhone 4s with any of the following carriers:  ul liT-Mobile (GSM)/li liMetro PCS (GSM)/li liVerizon (CDMA)/li liStraight Talk (CDMA)/li /ul  Edit: I ended up trying Metro PCS and haven't had any problems. They're using T-Mobile's signal, which works with my 4s.  <answer104069> You won't be able to use it on any CDMA networks.  T-Mobile is no problem.  Metro PCS has a big "bring your own device" headline on its site so I'd guess it's OK as well.  <comment124455> Doesn't T-Mobile use the 1700 MHz band for their network? The [iPhone 4S specs](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP643) don't list it as supported.
