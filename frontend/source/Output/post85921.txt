Difference between GSM and Global iPhone 5 <body> I want to download iPhone firmware, but I don't know my iPhone is Global or GSM soâ€¦  What is difference between "iPhone 5 (Global)" and "iPhone 5 (GSM)"?  How can I recognize if my iPhone is Global or GSM?  <answer85943> The CDMA model presumably has compatibility in more markets than the standard GSM model.  According tot he list below, unless you ordered your phone from a Chinese firm, if you have a CDMA model it also supports GSM.    GSM is a European standard and supports the EDGE network.  CDMA supports some networks branded as "3G", but YMMV.  Both are getting a bit long in the tooth as far as cutting-edge goes (IMO).  You can use this list to help identify if your model includes CDMA (Global) or GSM: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3939  Check the "Model" at the bottom on the back of the phone and cross-reference it with the model number on that list. Here are the relevant iPhone 5 data:  ul liGSM models: A1428, A1533 and A1530/li liCDMA models: A1429 and A1453/li liCDMA China models: A1528, A1530 and A1518/li /ul  <comment99064> Download site is http://www.insanelyios.com/firmware/
