How do I download photos from Picasa to the iPod Photo Library for offline viewing? <body> I do not have Internet where I stay, so I want to download all of my photos in my Picasa album to my 32GB iPod for offline viewing.   How would I do that?  <answer64883> If you have a computer, download Picasa 3.9 for Mac/PC and use its batch downloading features. Then, in iTunes, connect your iPod, click Photos, check codeSync Photos from/code:, and click the dropdown menu to reveal codeChoose folder.../code and navigate to code~/Pictures/Downloaded Albums/xxxxxxxxxxxxx/albumname//code (with xxxxxxxxxx being your Google user ID number and albumname being the album you wish to import to your iPod). Sync and finish!
