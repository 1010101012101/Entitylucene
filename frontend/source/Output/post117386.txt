Xcode can't connect to OS X server <body> I have an OS X server configured to run Xcode "bots". I can't get Xcode to connect to the server with a user account. It recognizes the server, and the server appears in my "servers" list under Accounts on the development machine. I can connect and create bots as "Guest", but if I change the security settings on the server to "logged in users", then my development machine can no longer connect.  I have an account on the server. I can log in remotely with that account. I can log in via SSH with that account. It's an administrator account. But when I enter the account credentials in the Xcode preferences, it says "invalid credentials". Is there some hidden setting I'm missing?
