Effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root? <body> I copied a file named class-dump to my code/usr/bin/code folder, then neither Terminal.app nor iTerm2 work properly on my MacBook. There is something wrong with the codesudo/code command.  Here is what I did based on some online searching:  precodesudo  sudo: effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root? type sudo sudo is hashed (/usr/bin/sudo) ls -@@eil /usr/bin/sudo 1485457 -rwxrwxrwx  1 root  wheel  168448  7  9  2016 /usr/bin/sudo md5 /usr/bin/sudo MD5 (/usr/bin/sudo) = 7d986f7707c0f11264989cd7105ea80d /code/pre  Does anyone know how I can make codesudo/code work again?  <answer269008> ul liBoot to Recovery Mode(kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd)/Internet Recovery Mode (kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd)./li liGet the name of your main system volume: codedf/codebr Usually it's the "Mounted on"- name of the device disk0s2 (e.g Macintosh HD) - simply check the sizes./li liEnter codechmod 4511 /Volumes/Name_Of_Sys_Vol/usr/bin/sudo/code  Replace Name_Of_Sys_Vol by the volume name found in the previous command.

Therefore I assume Sierra isn't installed or SIP is disabled.  If Sierra is installed and SIP is enabled you have to disable it before applying changes to sudo..  <comment337888> Have you run `chmod` on `/usr`, `/usr/bin` or `/usr/bin/sudo` before? The permissions look very wrong - here's what I get from `ls -@@eil`: `101580151 -r-s--x--x  1 root  wheel   360K 14 Sep 01:56 /usr/bin/sudo*` <comment337889> Do you have a Recovery Partition on your system? With `sudo` not working you'll need to boot into it to `chmod` the command back into a sane state <comment337890> Yes I have run `sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/class-dump` to give class-dump.app more power. As for `ls -@@eil`, I don't know what the result is meant for. <comment337891> Does the Recoverry Partition mean using the disk utility? I have tried the emergency function, but nothing happened. <comment338049> It works! Now the sudo command can work correctly. Thanks!
