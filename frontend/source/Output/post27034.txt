How can I stop fseventsd for certain volumes? <body> I also have a partion with Ubuntu installed. Unfortunately, every time I have an error while working on the Ubuntu partion (I believe it's ext3), I get a Kernel Panic and I have to restart. I believe this is related to fseventsd, since it my try to log the errors on the root of the Ubuntu partition.  How can I stop fseventsd logging events on that Ubuntu volume?  Thank you!  <answer27060> OS X does not have a built-in ext3 driver so it's not possible to even access the Ubuntu partition from OS X.  There is a lot of information missing here making it impossible to correctly assess what is causing your kernel panic.  Are you even using Apple hardware?  <answer81737> h1Preventing file system event storage/h1  Whilst you should not stop the daemon, you can disable logging on a per-volume basis.   h2In the Mac Developer Library/h2  File System Events Programming Guide: File System Event Security: Preventing File System Event Storage advises:      … To disable logging on a per-volume basis (for creating a backup   volume, for example), you must do the following:      ul   liCreate a code.fseventsd/code directory at the top level of the volume./li   liCreate an empty codeno_log/code file in that directory./li   /ul      So if your volume is mounted at code/Volumes/MyDisk/code, you would create an   empty file called code/Volumes/MyDisk/.fseventsd/no_log/code.   hr  h1Kernel panics/h1  Please consider creating a separate question.   <comment30959> There's been some confusion about this question and how it relates to Mac OS X. As I understand it, the Mac process `fseventsd` is messing up your Ubuntu partition and causing kernel panics, and your question is how to tell Mac OS X to stop fseventsd logging for a particular volume. Is that correct? If so, this question is on topic for Ask Different. <comment31089> Yes, I am using Apple hardware. In order to access ext4 (Ubuntu partition) I'm using 3rd party driver from Paragon (Paragon ExtFS). From what I understand, the fseventsd process writes error logs on the root of the partition that you are working on. So, let's say I am working in terminal on the ubuntu partition, once receive and error message there, I get my kernel panic. I need to know how can I stop this process to stop logging error messages for my Ubuntu partition. <comment31090> Yes Nathan, I need to stop that process from logging errors for my Ubuntu partition. I believe it might be a conflict of permissions that causes this kernel panics whenever I am working in the terminal on the Ubuntu partition, and I get an error message (stderr).
