Default credentials, printing and macOS Sierra <body> We use a Windows print server and until now it was possible to store the needed credentials in the KeyChain. By the first print, OS X asks for username and password with the possibility to remember it.  On all the machines we updated to macOS Sierra, the system asks for the credentials for each print:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xgh3v.png" alt="enter image description here"  The stored password is correct, and I only need to press "OK".  Is there a way to avoid the confirmation dialog (as on all the previous OS versions)?  <comment315965> This feels like a bug. I get the same problem when network volumes are auto-mounting â€” the password is in the Keychain and is filled but I have to OK it, just like your printer problem.
