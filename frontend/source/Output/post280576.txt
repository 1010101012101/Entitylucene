MacOS Server Profile Manager Login Script <body> I need to set a login script for our mac hosts using Profile Manager on MacOS Server. I have uploaded this and other simple test scripts many times and had no success.   On the page in Profile Manager where scripts are uploaded, there are these instructions:     The above settings require specific properties in the file   ~root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist, located on the   client computer:      ul   liSet EnableMCXLoginScripts to TRUE./li   liSet MCXScriptTrust to match the binding settings used to connect the client computer to the directory domain./li   /ul   I have added those keys to the codecom.apple.loginwindow.plist/code files located in both code/var/root/Library/Preferences/code and code~/Library/Preferences/code, but no scripts will run.  I can't seem to find anything about running scripts in this manner anywhere online, not for lack of trying. If there is any documentation regarding this, that would also be helpful.
