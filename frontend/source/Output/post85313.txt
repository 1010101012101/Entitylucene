Downloading videos and saving to camera roll? <body> I need a tweak like "Download Manager pro", which allows you to download any video you play. The thing is, it saves to its own private storage (and not camera roll) so I can't share them with anyone.  Does anyone knows a tweak that does this job?  <answer85511> There are a few tweaks for jailbroken iOS that can import videos into the Videos app:  ul liMusic2iPod (free). I haven't tested this one though./li liBridge ($2)./li liThe paid version of iFile ($4), using the Gremlin library./li liYourTube ($4) also uses the Gremlin library and lets you import videos directly from the YouTube app./li /ul  <answer128158> you can download form cydia universale video downloader  <answer159562> Titan Downloader (Video Download &amp; Player - Titan Downloader) (app store app) lets you use browser inside the app &amp; when you click on a video, you can save it to cache on the app &amp; when you click on the videos tab you can save the video to camera roll or just keep it in the app, your choice.  I personally bought the pro because it is worth it in all honesty. Can save more videos.  <answer163210> Use MediaBurner, you can download and transfer your video in the camera roll  <comment98300> What is a tweak and what does this run on? <comment98535> @Mark Since this question has a "jailbreak" tag, I believe Andrei is referring to extensions installable on jailbroken iOS devices. <comment191265> @britta - The "jailbreak" tag was not put by Andrei.
