RSS reader and archiver application? <body> I am looking for a decent RSS reader app that would double up as an archiver. It would let me flag any posts that I find valuable for PERMANENT storage in a database. Even when the blog is no longer online, this application would let me browse and read the articles I've saved, for YEARS to come.  So I am really looking for the ability to backup RSS posts. Reading offline is only a side effect. I want to be able to flag some of my feeds for permanent storage too, so I don't need to flag each post individually.  Some of the blogs I have been following on personal development topics have a distinct voice and just won't be replaced. Unfortunately, as I have found out blogs (and forums) emdo/em disappear. And with them, a treasure trove of information that would have continued to be useful to me for years to come.  Does a solution exist on OS X or iOS?  <answer33249> Newsfire archives entries as long as you want it to.  <comment37852> Does it have to be a single app? I use Reeder and Instapaper and while Instapaper doesn't store things permanently, it does cache things so they're not dependent on a site being up or you even being connected. I've never thought about moving something from Instapaper's cache to a more permanent place but surely its doable by saving things as PDFs locally. <comment37985> Thanks, I have it installed. Had forgotten about that. I guess that's as close as I'll get to what I want. <comment37986> Yes, I would want to have everything available to read offline as well. <comment38334> Oh I just noticed it also never deletes flagged items, awesome!
