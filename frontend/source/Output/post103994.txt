Why do documents in the iCloud window appear disabled? <body> Hereâ€™s how documents appear in the iCloud window of one of my apps:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZjYbK.png" alt="Disabled documents"  I have created these documents before. They looked OK. When I quit the app and come back, they look like this, disabled, and apparently no way to open them. I can create a new document, but it will appear all the same. When I save a document with the same name as these to overwrite them, it will appear all the same.  Why are these documents disabled, and can I do anything myself to fix it?  <comment122495> What do you see if you go to `~/Library/Mobile Documents/Calca-bundle-ID`? <comment122505> I see the two Markdown documents existing as actual files, with the correct content.
