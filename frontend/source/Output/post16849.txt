How do I disable the volume control overlay? <body> When changing the volume on a Mac, you get a big ugly gray bezel showing the change in volume. This is super annoying when (say) watching a movie. Is there any way to disable this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TzJRe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer16850> There's no built-in method for doing so, but Googling brings up suggestions such as overriding the image used for it so that it's less obtrusive.  <answer29890> Don't use the volume keys. If you change the volume with the menu bar control the overlay does not display.   Note you only need to activate the menu item, and then the cursor keys can be used to manipulate it  <answer30015> In automator, create a new service that takes no input. Give it a single action: Run AppleScript Enter the following AppleScript:  precodeset x to get output volume of (get volume settings) if x &gt;  10 then      set volume output volume (x-10) else     set volume output volume 0 end if /code/pre  Save the service with the name "Volume down", and bind the service to F11.  Create another new service that takes no input. Give it a single action: Run AppleScript Enter the following AppleScript:  precodeset x to get output volume of (get volume settings) if x &lt; 90 then      set volume output volume (x+10) else     set volume output volume 100 end if /code/pre  Save the service with the name "Volume up" and bind the service to F12.  Goodbye volume overlay.  <answer176445> I found the AppleScript solution didn't work for me, I wasn't able to bind the scripts to my volume up and down buttons (on my remote or keyboard). Due possibly to the much newer OS X.  Playing around however, I've found a solution which disables ALL Bezel services (anything that comes up in the grey translucent square; volume, screen brightness, keyboard brightness, etc.).  Working off patrix' information concerning where the relevant files are located, I renamed "BezelUIServer" to "mBezelUIServer" (although any rename is adequate, this one is easily reversed).  Find the file here: /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/Bezel‌​UI/  Hope this can help you or any future googler's.   <answer196289> For anyone who's interested, this worked like a charm for me on Yosemite:  precodesudo /bin/chmod -x /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/BezelUI/BezelUIServer /code/pre  <answer197156> Simple solution:  precode/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/Bezel‌ UI/ /code/pre  sup'Show Package Contents' on 'BezelServices.loginPlugin' to access through Finder/sup  Rename “BezelUIServer” to something else  (I just put a space at the front of it) - this will disable the volume overlay.  <answer212694> Hold up, don't modify important system files!br Mac OS has a nice way to start/stop services without doing permanent damage.  strongTo turn off bezels for this user until next login:/strongbr codelaunchctl unload -F /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.BezelUI.plist/codebr To undo, change codeunload/code to codeload/code, or just log out and back in.

It just draws a bar in the top center of your screen. It may get more functionality in the future.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/RHo90AE.png" alt="picture"  https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL  https://github.com/w0lfschild/cleanHUD  <comment34091> The post you link to suggests modifying images in a folder that doesn't exist under Lion. <comment34198> Under Lion they are in `/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/BezelUI/HiDPI/` but the PDFs seem to be empty. <comment34338> Is there a way to do this easily from the keyboard? The question mentions watching a movie, and showing the menu bar isn't really an improvement over the bezel in that case. <comment34339> ^F8 will move focus to the status menus...cursor across to the volume control and up/down to adjust. Make sure this setting is enabled in System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts - Keyboard and Text Input <comment34427> And thanks for the AppleScript blog posts, @Nathan Greenstein, that helped me to do this. I'm new to AppleScript. <comment34430> Awesome answer! What a great idea. Just FYI, those checks are unnecessary; the volume will automatically bottom out at 0 and top out at 100. <comment213800> Thanks Plastonick, I had a problem with the F5 key that goes nuts occasionally and auto-presses.....and this causes the annoying key brightness OSD to show up. I disabled all the OSD and even if I was a bit worried of losing the volume and lcd brightness notification, I have to say using the mac without EVERY overlay is a much better experience....they disturb you from concentrating and there's no need for an OSD when I can cleary see the effects of the keys we're pressing.... <comment237919> What does it do? <comment238492> It disables the volume control overlay, as the original poster wanted to do.  It's just a simpler method and works in Yosemite. <comment238548> I mean what is it doing technically? <comment238565> You are removing the execute permission for all users for BezelUIServer.  So it can't execute. <comment256816> There is indeed a built-in method for doing so. See [my answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16849/how-do-i-disable-the-volume-control-overlay/212694#212694) below. <comment256817> Why not just tell the launchd job manager to not start BezelUIServer in the first place? See [my answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16849/how-do-i-disable-the-volume-control-overlay/212694#212694) below. <comment258271> It won't let me modify it. It says that it is required by OSX. I'm using El Capitan 10.11. <comment264560> From far the best answer! <comment264571> Thanks! Only problem is that my answer came 4 years later… <comment276111> It's because of [System Integrity Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection). You can actually disable it if you want, but it's not recommended and can expose you to security threats. Also, changes in system files can be overridden by future updates. <comment286650> Don't go through all this hassle just run some of the commands interestinglythere mentioned in his answer. <comment301674> Looks like this solution won't work in 10.12 because the launch agent and BezelUIServer is removed. <comment314101> It works for this session, but it doesn't work indefinitely. It gives me `com.apple.BezelUI.plist: Could not find specified service`. Edit: It works!, It just needed to load the service again, so I can unload it.... <comment331070> `BezelUI` changed to `OSDUIHelper` in 10.12 – the new file is `/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.OSDUIHelper.plist` <comment334786> Thanks for the tip @HawkenRives! I updated my answer. Unfortunately, it involves disabling System Integrity Protecting on 10.12+, so if anyone has a better solution, let me know. <comment368162> When I try the unload command, I get this message: /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.BezelUI.plist: No such file or directory <comment369811> Are you on macOS 10.12? If so, please follow only the 10.12-specific instructions.
