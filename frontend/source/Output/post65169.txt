Is it possible to delete the "useless" apps pre-installed on my Mac? <body> There are some preinstalled apps that came with my laptop that I know I wil never ever use.   Apps like "Notes", "Stickies", "Game Center", etc.. that were preinstalled in my Macbook Pro are apps that I don't plan on ever using and it's taking up too much space in my Application Folder.  Are there any ways to remove them? Please note that I have already tried dragging it to the Trash bin, but it won't even go to the Trash bin. It' just stuck in my computer forever.  <answer65170> In general, you can remove applications simply by dragging them to the Trash (and emptying the Trash). In this case, you can't remove them because they are part of the core OS. Hence error message in Finder (Mountain Lion):     "Stickies" can't be modified or deleted because it's required by Mac OS X.   You can almost certainly remove the core application from the command line, but I wouldn't recommend it:  precoderm -rf /Applications/Stickies.app /code/pre  <answer65174> Right click on the application, then go to get info. There change the sharing &amp; permissions to read &amp; write for everyone. Then you can delete the application.  <answer65175> I strongstrongly/strong recommend against removing standard applications:  ul liMost of them need hardly any space at all (the three mentioned in the question need 14 MBytes emtogether/em)/li liAn upcoming OS X version may expect them to be there/li liThere is no easy way to get them back once you removed them/li /ul  <answer65190> Mac OS X includes various components that it expects to find as part of the operating system. Some of these live in code/System/code or code/Library/code, but some required parts of the operating system live in code/Applications/code. While you might think it is harmless to delete, say, codeChess.app/code, and there is a good likelihood that you can delete it without adverse side effects, a future update to the operating system or a third-party program might rely on its presence for functionality. Once deleted, re-intsalling applications that are OS components is rather challenging.  You express your concern for removing the programs as connected to the fact that they "take up space" in the code/Applications/code folder. This could mean either they consume disk space, or they take up visual space when you list the directory.  As far as disk space is concerned, on most installations of Mac OS X, space in code/Applications/code is the same as space in any other directory: space on the primary system drive. While these applications do indeed take up a non-zero amount of space, relative to the size of the operating system, the space saved by removing them is fairly trivial, while the risk of side effects is slightly less trivial  If visual space is the concern, however, you can make these programs disappear while leaving them in place in case the system needs them. At a terminal prompt, you will need to type  precode  sudo chflags hidden /Applications/Stickies.app /code/pre  (for Stickies, for instance; substitute the name of any other program you wish to hide).  The codesudo/code part of the command runs the command with administrative privileges (necessary to modify system files). codechflags hidden/code tells the system to mark these files as "hidden files" that will still be present on disk, but not appear in Finder windows. Finally, code/Applications/Sitckies.app/code is the path to the application you want to hide.  <answer65271> At one time or another I have deleted a whole bunch of the standard issue programs that I knew I wouldn't use.  I prefer not to have them wasting my space, however little it may be.  Also, I use a Mac Mini as a media centre, changing the standard hdd for an ssd, so space is at a premium.  Appcleaner is one app that I have used for several years to tidy stuff up.  Never had a single issue with deleting Stickies, Notes, Bootcamp Assistant, Audio Midi Setup, RAID, Podcast, etc, etc.  Appcleaner preferences should be set up to delete "protected" apps and then will delete the app and all the other files (plists, etc.) that go with it.  Another app, CleanMyMac, does the same, but will also do a more general clearout of caches, etc.  Both recommended...  Good luck!  <answer142530> go to finder and find the apps and drag them to trash and then empty trash   ALERT: THIS ONLY WORKS FOR MAC OS X 10.7.5  <answer218657> The Change Flags Method works prior to El Capitan due to the SIP feature meant to provide more security. Unless you have a dedicated recovery drive it seems that even booting into recovery mode and using: csrutil disable will return as unrecognized. You must have Recovery Partition locally on disk. Otherwise there is no easy way with El Capitan. App Cleaner is the way to go.  <comment76563> First thing I tried, couldn't even get it into the trash bin <comment76566> You're right, this must have changed in Mac OS X since I last tried it (to prevent people from doing precisely that to system applications). I updated my answer accordingly. <comment76568> It takes up space in my app folder and I cannot find anyway to get rid of them <comment76569> `chflags hidden Notes.app` :-) But maybe you are better of with pulling the most used applications into the Dock and using Spotlight to access the others by name. <comment77023> Even if I bought your "too much space" characterization, a clean Mountain Lion install uses 944 MB once you have updated to 10.8.2. The three you mention take less space than three songs from iTunes that take 9 minutes to play through. If you just don't want to see the apps, and not break updates, just set the hidden bit and they will "disappear". `cd /Applications; sudo chflags hidden Notes.app Stickies.app Game\ Center.app` For the curious - here is [the full list of apps sorted by size](http://cl.ly/JmEl) on 10.8.2. You can delete them with the `rm` command but hiding is safer for updates. <comment264353> Please can you add this as a comment to the appropriate answer. <comment264403> He can't add it as a comment, because of not enough karma <comment349888> Nothing apple ships should be necessary in order to use one's Mac. I say uninstall it all to generate crash reports to send them to let them know their useless software is crap and nothing more than bloatware.
