iOS App Store shows wrong version number for my app <body> I have a new app update that shows version number 2.5, but when you tap the app for more details and check the Information section the version number is still 2.4.2.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/055Fam.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hVhEnm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer187990> This is simply caching, Apple serving the same information to clients over time so as not to put additional strain on their database. I see this every time I update one of my apps.  It'll fix itself in several hours, perhaps a day at most.
