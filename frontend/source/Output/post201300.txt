Is there any way to change MAC-address of built-in Bluetooth adapter? <body> I should change MAC-address of a built-in Bluetooth adapter. Is there any way to do it in Yosemite (10.10.4)?  Please note - the question is about Bluetooth, not about Wi-Fi. codeifconfig/code doesn't see Bluetooth device.  I've already tried to update my bluetooth adapter address in code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code (Root\PANInterfaces\Item 0):  precode# turn bluetooth off cp /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist cp /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist.backup # edit ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist  sudo cp ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist cd /Library/Preferences sudo chown root:wheel com.apple.Bluetooth.plist defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist # turn bluetooth on /code/pre  But it doesn't help.  <answer203215> Look into SpoofMAC on GitHub which allows you to change ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth addresses and interfaces. There's all the instructions to get you started, on that page.  <comment244445> Did you reboot after changing the entry in the plist file? <comment244455> @patrix, the value is saved after reboot, but looks like it is something different - the actual value (displayed on bluetooth icon click with Option key) is still old. <comment245154> It doesn't work with Bluetooth (at least on Mac) - please see the text about ifconfig in my question.
