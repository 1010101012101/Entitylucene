Why doesn't anything happen when I connect my Nexus S to a MacBook Pro 2010 using a USB cable? <body> I've tried to connect a Nexus S to a MBP 2010 via USB. After connection, the Mac does not respond.  Anybody know why? I have tried it with a powered USB hub and get the same result: No responses for the USB storage.  <answer17698> Fire up system profiler on your mac. This can be refreshed to show all USB devices connected - even if there is a driver issue, at least you'll know if the cable and physical connection are good.  <answer17732> You may need to download software provided by Samsung to connect your device by USB.  <answer35953> And finally I have found this issue is caused by a bad USB cable.  It is working when I use a HTC USB cable to connect to my MBP.    <comment19337> What do you mean by "not any responses"? Which response do you expect? <comment19340> What are you using from your Nexus-S? The USB Storage? The Internet Connection? <comment41021> The Samsung Nexus-S doesn't need any software and should appear as a regular USB storage where you can copy/move music, pictures and videos.
