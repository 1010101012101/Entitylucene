Cannot install Windows on my Mac <body> I have a 2008 Macbook running Lion. I started up Boot Camp and it gave an error saying the startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition.  I looked at Disk Utility and there was a partition named Lion which was taking up all 250 GB of space and I cannot resize it.  Also the OS X installation has no recovery drives or images, so the normal methods wont work.  Is there any way I could install Windows 10 on this machine without having to resort to VM or a clean reinstall?  <answer212643> I am sorry For not Responding For the Last few days.Unfortunately i had to format and reinstall Lion to install win 7.The hard drive was set up in such a way that it could not create a Boot Camp partition  even if only 20GBs of the 250 was used.  After Formatting the Drive as A journaled mac OS partition,I was able to install Win 7.  BTW i Could not make any changes to the drive before formatting.New partition,Restore etc. were all grayed out.  <comment255957> How much of the 250GB are actually used? <comment255968> You have to make a partition on your MacintoshHD. http://www.macworld.com/article/1164643/live_partition.html <comment256052> Exactlyâ€”you can't just resize the Lion partition without having another partition available to use the space. You need to click the `+` button below the partition map, then go from there.
