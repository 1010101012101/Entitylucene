Partition/Volume grayed out but full read/write access <body> i have a Mac Server and a partition only for files. The volume is grayed out in the Finder sidebar, but if i go to the folder via CMD + G (go to folder) and type "/Volumes/Server_Daten" the volume opens and i can read and write. If i go to informations (CMD + ALT + I) i can't change the permissions (little lock symbol is grayed out too).  I have the root user enabled, but even as root i can't change the permissions and have to go to the folder via CMD + G.  How can i fix the grayed out volume in the sidebar?  <answer101083> I figured it out:  The partition was hidden (i don't know why...) so i made it visible again:  precodechflags nohidden /Volumes/MY_PARTITION /code/pre  <comment138274> Excellent, thanks. You wouldn't believe the fixes some of the mac forums are proposing for this...
