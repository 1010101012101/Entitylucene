Siri and Mail app in OSX are not working behind http/https Proxy and port settings <body> Internet provided by my university is behind http/https proxy and port settings. I typed settings in the Mac preferences. Safari, App Store, Terminal and all other applications work, but Siri and the Mail app are not working.  I am using MacBook Pro Mid 2012 with OSX 10.12.1 macOS Sierra.   In the other case everything works in my home WiFi. It is not working in the university network.  <comment329996> To be sure to understand your comparison, is your home network using also a proxy to protect your Internet access? Please clarify your comparison in your original question (OQ).
