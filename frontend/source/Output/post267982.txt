macOS Help on top <body> Some years ago I read tip to stop Help popping up on top of the open document. (At the time I found it annoying as you couldn't actually see the document.)  I would like to reverse this, but cannot remember how I did it, or even find the original hint.  <answer267985> In Terminal, simply paste the following and hit kbdreturn/kbd:  precodedefaults write com.apple.helpviewer DevMode -bool true /code/pre  The changes should take effect immediately, though you will need to close any Help windows that are currently open.  To undo it, run the same command but with codefalse/code:  precodedefaults write com.apple.helpviewer DevMode -bool false /code/pre
