How to increase text font size system-wide on iOS? <body> I want to effect an increase in system-wide font size for both built-in and third-party apps on iOS 9.x. What is best approach between Option 1 &amp; 2 below? Do I need to use a combination of settings from 1 &amp; 2?  Option 1: Dynamic Type slider preferred reading size (under Settings | Display &amp; Brightness | Text Size). Assume this is 'the right way' bur seems many apps do not support this API.  Option 2: Accessibility 'Larger Text Sizes' toggle emand/em slider (under Settings | General | Accessibility). Am guessing this is a more brute-force approach.  <answer217492> You are gonna need a jailbroken iphone and Bytafont2 installed.   http://ioshacker.com/how-to/change-system-wide-font-iphone-ipad-bytafont-2  <comment262920> Thank you for the recommendation.
