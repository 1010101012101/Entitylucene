concatenate text files in multiple folders <body> I have hundreds of folders with a few text files in each folder.  I'm trying to concatenate the files of each folder into a single text file.  One file for each folder.    Ideally, the concatenated files would be saved to another location.   <answer157643> You can do with a simple script:  precode#!/bin/bash  directories="/your/path/dir1 /your/path/dir2 /your/path/dir3"  for d in $directories do         cat $(find $d -name "*.txt") &gt; $(echo $d | sed 's/\///g').txt done /code/pre  This script will concatenate every txt file on code/your/path/dir1/code and saves it as codeyourpathdir1.txt/code in your actual path. Then will do the same with codedir2/code and codedir3/code.  <comment185819> Thanks @jherran.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working.  I get the following error"/My/path/file.txt/\: No such file or directory".  Man  wish I know this stuff better,  I feel like you've gotten me really close.
