Screen video capture application <body> I am Looking for a program that let's me capture screen videos on Mac OS X.  I am requesting it for these two use cases:  ol liCapture of a webcam. It should allow capturing only the webcam App window./li liCreation of program tutorials. Ideally, it should allow mouse cursor magnification and visual click representation (like, making some visual effect when you click on anything)./li /ol  A different program for each case use is fine if there is not a program that can do both.  <answer4496> After some research I've learnt that for the second use case you can use a separate program that does mouse magnification and keystroke detection in conjunction with a regular screen recording program like Quicktime Player (included on Mac OS X). Mouseposé seems the most recommended one.  As for a standalone screen capture program that has more features than Quicktime Player, I've found four that are maybe the most widely used ones:  ul liScreenFlow /li liCamtasia for Mac/li liiShowU/li liSnapz Pro X/li /ul  ScreenFlow offers mouse cursor customization, and iShowU offers keystroke and mouse action recording, for showing in the video. ScreenFlow, iShowYou and Camtasia are looking great. Snapz Pro X seems more focused to regular screenshot capturing, but does video as well.  <answer4498> My firsthand experience with ScreenFlow has been great for creating tutorials. It includes cursor magnification, cursor and window highlighting, etc., and a decent editor.  I agree that Camtasia looks great, too, but I've not tried it.  <answer5294> Try Jing. Free version have no cam support, but if you really need it there's a pro version for $14.90 / year. Great app, mac style.  <answer7663> I've found that "New Screen Recording" functionality in QuickTime Player combined with iMovie editing capabilities is enough for my needs. Maybe you can give it a try? Best of all, it's already installed on your Mac. Unfortunately, I can't compare it with Camtasia, as I haven't used it.  <answer7669> There's a question about recording the screen of an OpenGL application without stuttering here at StackExchange.  <answer10924> If it comes down to choosing between Camstasia for Mac and Screenflow, here's a side by side comparison: http://www.skillcasting.com/comparison-camtasia-mac-vs-screenflow/  <comment4323> ScreenFlow looks very promising indeed, specially with all the speed and performance optimizations that are advertised on their website. Does it allow to capture just a part of the screen (or crop it after capturing on the included editor)? <comment4326> would you please provide link for software recommended. <comment4328> Links provided and self-answer greatly improved, props to Martín Marconcini for providing useful info on this other question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2653/how-to-record-the-screen-of-an-opengl-application-without-stuttering <comment15224> Nice link, thanks!
