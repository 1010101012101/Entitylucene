Full screen always enabled when opening app in OS X <body> How can I set my Macbook Air to always open new apps in full screen mode?   Some apps already do it (Mail for example), but others are always opening as a small window, especially Safari when I close (cmd+W) all the tabs.  Is there a setting, a terminal command line, or anything to fix this?  <answer236300> There's an option called resume I think - check out this post. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4140495?tstart=0.  To quote the answer, you can do     System Preferences  General  Uncheck 'Close windows when quitting an   application'   Not exactly what you want, but it's a possible alternative maybe?
