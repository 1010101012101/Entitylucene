How can I recover missing iCloud storage space? <body> I have an iCloud account with the free 5GB storage, which I want to use for backups.  I have a strange situation where my iCloud is showing as having only 2.2GB space available:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D39Lp.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KfTvhm.png" alt="enter image description here"  But isn't showing what is using up the space.  I have previously used it for backups of various devices, but these aren't showing.  How can I recover my lost space?  <answer208188> strongManage your iCloud storage/strong  Learn how to manage your iCloud storage if you reach or exceed your storage limit.  You can manage your storage by upgrading your iCloud storage plan or reducing the amount of storage that you're using.

They tried a load of things (none of which worked), and eventually they then asked me to delete the WhatsApp Documents &amp; Data storage. Despite it saying that only 350MB was being used by WhatsApp, deleting this immediately freed up around 2.8GB (350MB plus the ~2.5GB of "lost" space) in iCloud.  <comment251145> As you can see, the OP has already done this, and he is using **2.2 GB**, where it should only be around **350 MB**
