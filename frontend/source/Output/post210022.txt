Automate Fn key switch between finder and photoshop? <body> I would like to know if there any script that i can use to switch automatically between finder and photoshop?  I can't install Palua App from my AppStore on El-capitan.  <answer210030> I would try making your shortcuts with Fast Scripts - it's free for 10 shortcuts or less.  ul lihttps://red-sweater.com/fastscripts//li /ul  <answer210057> You could use Spaces.br Lock each app to its own space then use the built-in system hot keys to switch between those Spaces.  See my answer at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/179403/85275 for some working methods.
