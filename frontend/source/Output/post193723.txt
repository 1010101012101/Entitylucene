Scaling all UI elements when using an external monitor <body> When I use my Macbook Pro's internal monitor, I have the following options in the Display settings menu: http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5996/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-11%20at%204.29.36%20PM.png  The best thing here is the Scaled option, which means that I can use the native resolution of the screen and rescale all UI elements bigger or smaller depending on my taste and they still look very sharp.  However, when I connect my Macbook to a 2K monitor, the Scaled option is not available, I can only set the resolution. The Display settings menu looks somewhat like this: img src="https://www.macobserver.com/imgs/tmo_articles/20120925_rmbpexternalresolution4.jpg" alt=""  I don't want to change the resolution of my external monitor since I always want to use the native resolution of the monitor to achieve maximum sharpness. However, in my opinion the default UI size of the Mac is a bit too small on a typical 27" 2K screen so I would like to scale all UI elements bigger (I mean all, not just fonts) as it is possible to do using the internal monitor.  According to some screenshots that I found, the scaled menu is available at least for this 4K monitor: img src="https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/03/osx_1093_4k_support-800x493.jpg?retina" alt=""  strongSo my question is: Why isn't the scaled option always available when using an external monitor with Mac?/strong  By the way, the equivalent option in Windows is to change the DPI settings, which causes all elements to look bigger and sharp and it works on all displays: img src="https://www.lawfirmsoftware.com/support/images/dpi_windows7/540px-How_to_Change_DPI_Size_in_Windows_7-009.png" alt=""  <answer193726> The OS X UI is not resolution-independent, the only thing you can do is to change the resolution. Which is essentially what OS X does on HiDPI screens when switching to Larger Text or More Space, but since they are retina displays, you can't see that the resolution in some cases is not native, which you definitively can on non-retina displays.   There is a terminal command to change the interface size (which I can't seem to find right now, but I have tried once in 10.6 I believe), but it doesn't work well, especially in 3rd party applications. Some are absolutely unusable.  <answer248829> You can use the app RDM to scale any monitors but honestly it is not perfect for 1080p monitors because 1280 HiDPI is designed for 2K monitors like the internal one. On my 60" 1080p monitor it looks a big blurry everywhere, so much worse than the native scale mode while the font does look too small. So I would actually just prefer having bigger fonts on 1080p monitors.  <comment231045> Oh, you're right. The resolution scaling option does indeed change the resolution of the screen, making everything bigger but not tehnically sharper. :( I think it's sad that Apple has not been able to implement better support for resolution independence. While Windows is neither resolution indepentent, the scaling factor does work better as it's just resizes elements and keeping them (usually) sharp while still using the native display resolution. <comment354078> *"The OS X UI is not resolution-independent"* - It's not? If you use the screen zoom function, all the standard UI is scaled perfectly. It's been that way for years. There's also API for developers to make sure their custom UI is drawn correctly at the given scale. Whether third party apps do it correctly or not is another story. <comment354170> @JoshuaNozzi see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_independence - there is a part explaining the state of Mac OS under "implementation"
