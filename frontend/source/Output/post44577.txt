How do I prevent my Mac from opening so many windows every time I restart? <body> I have to restart my Mac all the time because I'm using Boot Camp and switching in between Windows 8 and OS X. Every time I restart and come back to OS X, my screen gets flooded with open windows, every thing from Firefox to text editors. Is there any way to set it up  so that there are no open windows upon restart?    <answer44579> When you go to shutdown/restart, unclick the check box to disable the resume feature, which is likely what is opening all these windows (that were present upon shutdown).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9TVGX.png" alt="enter image description here"  If this doesn't do it, check that these applications are not in your user start up list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KG2em.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44582> You have two choices. You can choose that your applications not resume their previous state when you shutdown or restart the Mac by deselecting the checkbox that appears prior to shutdown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1SbOg.png" alt="image of Shutdown Dialog box"  Or you can navigate to the strongGeneral/strong pane in System Preferences and deselect the emRestore windows when quitting and re-opening apps/em option. However, if you do this, applications will never resume their previous state, even when quit and restarted during a single emboot/em session.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jnqUp.png" alt="image of General Preferences Pane"  <answer44607> h1Disable Resume on login empermanently/em/h1  What you are experiencing are the benefits of working with strongResume/strong.

This can be achieved by manual tweaking.  Open the Terminal and enter:  precodecurl http://goo.gl/Z4EFC -L -s -o ~/fixlogin.sh &amp;&amp; md5 -q ~/fixlogin.sh | xargs -I % mv ~/fixlogin.sh ~/%.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh &amp;&amp; sudo ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh ; rm ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh /code/pre  This command downloads the following script and fully installs it:  precode#!/bin/bash echo "#!/bin/bash" &gt; /tmp/loginfix.sh echo "rm /Users/*/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*" &gt;&gt; /tmp/loginfix.sh mv /tmp/loginfix.sh /usr/bin/loginfix.sh chmod +x /usr/bin/loginfix.sh defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /usr/bin/loginfix.sh /code/pre  strongEt voil√†, you are done!/strong  If you want to revert to the default behavior of Resume in lion, type this.  precodesudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /code/pre  h1Disable Resume when launching apps/h1  You can also disable Resume for applications on a emper app/em basis. See these answers here.  <comment50711> I've added an answer to disable this function on a *permanent* basis. Current answers require you to click the checkbox on **every** shutdown. <comment50781> +1, but I suggest you include the source for that script in your answer.  The thought of executing a script sight-unseen and downloaded from a shortened link makes me nervous :-) <comment50786> @ChrisW.Rea No problem. I've edited my post :) <comment96335> Is there a way to get this script working for network user accounts? <comment96336> @GeertHuylebroeck If you want, that might make a great full question on the site - just link back to here, explain you want to craft this script for another use and explain what's failing. Our guides on [ask] and [about] should help. <comment99600> The "Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps" option is not available in Mountain Lion (10.8.2). Has that been moved elsewhere? <comment213087> I found that some items in the dock had "Open at Login" checked (right click dock icon  Open at Login), removing that stopped them popping up at login. <comment315588> The site hosting the script seems to no longer exist. Fortunately you can just deny yourself permissions to that plist file, which I've written up [as an answer on the first copy of this question I found](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/253609/202172) <comment363802> after you disabled it permanently is there a way to enable it on demand?
