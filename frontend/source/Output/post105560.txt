How to prevent Option+Command+Space from opening "Searching This Mac"? <body> The following keyboard shortcut will always bring up a window that says emSearching "This Mac"/em:  kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd  I would like to use this shortcut for another purpose.  Is there any way to disable this shortcut?  <answer105561> Yes. Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongSpotlight/strong and uncheck the box for the strongSpotlight window keyboard shortcut/strong. Alternatively, replace the shortcut with a different shortcut.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d457O.png" width="425"  You can also enable/disable/modify the shortcut through strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongSpotlight/strong → strongShow Spotlight Window/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2B433.png" width="611"  <comment124112> That was it, thanks!  (I kept looking in the keyboard area of system preferences) <comment124113> @KirkWoll It's *also* in the keyboard pane! :) (See edit) <comment124114> you're right!  I think the main problem is I didn't realize that "Search My Mac" window had anything to do with "Spotlight". :)
