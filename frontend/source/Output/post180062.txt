How do I delete pictures of my iPhone which wont delete? <body> My iPhone 5 has an album which has been saved onto it through iTunes from another laptop, when I try and delete the album through iTunes it doesn't seem to give me the option to do so. If anyone could be able to inform me on how to complete the action of deleting the album I would appreciate it, Thank you.    <answer180067> The simple manner to do this is to make a folder containing one photo on your laptop desktop.  Then tell iTunes to sync photos from that folder. That will delete all locally stored photos and albums (other than the camera roll).  Also, you might update to iOS 8.3 which allows you to manage your entire Photo Library in the cloud in which case you can delete the offending photos and albums using a web browser on any computer or iOS device that's linked to your AppleID for Photos app.  <answer180075> This KB article from Apple shows you how to accomplish this:  Sync photos to your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch in iTunes  The relevant info is towards the bottom...  strongDelete synced photos/strong  ol liIn iTunes, locate and click on your device./li liClick Photos./li liChoose "Selected albums" and deselect the albums or collections you want to delete./li liTo delete all synced photos, deselect "Sync Photos from" and, when asked, click "Remove photos."/li liClick Apply./li /ol  hr  It sounds like you don't have access to the original computer that it was synced with though.
