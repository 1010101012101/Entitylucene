OSX AppStore Avoid updating certain apps <body> Is it possible to avoid updating certain Applications in OSX from AppStore. The idea behind is to avoid unnecessary updates.  For instance, I want to avoid updating iMovie as I donâ€™t use that so often and it is usually 200 MB.  emNote: I know that I have to click "Update" in AppStore for the update to start and currently I still haven't updated this application. I want to know if there is a way for it to not show in the AppStore Updates itself or to ignore it till a next update is available./em  <answer145973> If you click the emMore/em button at the bottom of the listed item, then right click after it has expanded, you should get a 'Hide Update' button - but it doesn't work for all apps.  Tested today with   ul liCamera Raw 5.0.7 - Hide Update button/li liOS X Update 10.9.5 - Hide Update button/li liXcode 6.0.1 - strongno/strong Hide Update button/li /ul
