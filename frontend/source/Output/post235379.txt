one person, two phones, one text thread <body> Is it possible for "Joe" to have two iphones with two different numbers and text Sally from both numbers, and when Sally receives Joe's texts they appear as one thread? In other words, Sally wouldn't know he has a second phone because it all appears as one thread. Thanks.  <answer235383> Yes. iMessage allows this with the following caveat.  ol liJoe uses iPhone A to sign into iCloud with his account. The phone number for the first phone gets associated with the AppleID / iCloud account./li liJoe uses iPhone B to sign into iCloud with the same account. Now both phone numbers are associated with the same Apple ID./li /ol  Now - set the "caller ID" in iMessage from both phones to be the same number (either can be chosen) and for iMessage recipients - all new messages started from iPhone A and iPhone B will be "from" one number.  This doesn't work for SMS since the carrier assigns the "correct" sender in that case.  <comment287901> Sure if she had both of joes phone numbers and/or email address on the same contact.
