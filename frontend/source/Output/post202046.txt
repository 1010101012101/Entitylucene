Logging camera access on OS X Yosemite and up <body> I'd like to have camera access by applications be logged in system logs, so that I can later search for camera access in the console app. Any idea if there is some debug feature in OS X to enable logging ?  <answer202048> I'm not certain how you would do it natively, but by pure coincidence I discovered this today, from Obdev, the makers of Little Snitch.       strongMicro Snitch/strong      Ever wondered if an application records audio through your Mac’s built-in microphone without your knowledge? Or if the camera captures video for no good reason?      With Micro Snitch there’s no doubt anymore. This ultra-light menu bar application operates inconspicuously in the background. It monitors and reports any microphone and camera activity to help you figure out if someone’s spying on you.        strongLogging/strong      Never miss any microphone or camera activity, even in your absence. Every status change is logged to a file, so you can review it later to find suspicious activities.   €3.99 direct, or also on Mac App Store showing at $3.99 US or £2.99 UK  emNo affiliation, &amp; I haven't tried it myself; I'm just a satisfied user of Little Snitch./em  <comment243686> Interesting. Thanks.
