Why the weird lag in Screen Sharing app when using the LG Ultrafine 5K monitor? <body> Hardware:  Late 2016 MacBook Pro w/ TouchBar LG Ultrafine 5K display  Setup:  Screen Sharing app connected to remote instance in the cloud  Problem:  Very slow response to keystrokes.  There is no problem in other applications.   The problem goes away if I disconnect the external display.  The problem does not go away if I switch from WiFi to a hardwired Ethernet connection.  I had thought this might be the monitor's shielding problem interfering with WiFi but no, it happens without WiFi.  Truly perplexing!  <answer273461> Apple's implementation of VNC ScreenSharing often falls short, with significant lag regardless of whether codeAdaptive Quality/code is selected or not. A more robust 3rd-party solution like (the free) VNCViewer will provide you with fine-grained compression control, allowing workable VNC sessions over the tightest of bandwidth (e.g. through a shell tunnel to a remote server with really low upload speeds).    <comment343791> Presuming you've tried `View`  `Adaptive Quality` in the Screen Sharing app? <comment343792> I hadn't but I see it's checked anyway.  Should I try "Full Quality"? <comment343793> Go for it - should increase lag though not reduce it haha. Equally have you tried 3rd-party stuff with much more customisability regarding compression, exact colour etc (I'm thinking of VNCViewer Free which I use all the time for speedy Linux screen sharing). <comment343807> Ha! VNCViewer fixes it!  What on earth could make Screen Sharing not play nicely with an external monitor? <comment343808> It's Apple's homespun (read terrible) version of VNC which has multiple seemingly inexplicable issues. I ditched the ScreenSharing app for VNCViewer years ago. Only thing you might miss is forwarding clipboard contents into a session (or retrieving them seamlessly) and of course drag and drop with files. <comment343812> VNCViewer is copying the clipboard back and forth between MacOS and Linux just fine, much better than Screen Sharing which I could only get to go from Linux to MacOS.  Thanks for the help! <comment343814> Yes, do please.
