macOS Safari printing puts top part of letters of last line on one page, and bottom part on the next <body> This is so ugly I can't believe I've put up with it for so long. This happens when I print certain pages, e.g. here: Modern garbage collection.  Printing it regular or with reader view shows the problem. In many cases, the last line of text spans two pages, the top part of the font characters on the previous page and the bottom part on the next pages.  How can I fix that?  <comment333173> Could be printer or printer drivers? Mine doesn't do that even on the URL you linked.
