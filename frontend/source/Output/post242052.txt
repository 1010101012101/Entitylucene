How to remote control Youtube from an iPhone? <body> I tried Chrome Remote Desktop but it's very difficult to use, specially because the Windows screen resolution is much higher than the phone's and it has a different orientation.  I remember Android used to have an app called Youtube Remote and I believe this functionality has been integrated into the main Youtube app, but it doesn't remote control Windows, only TVs.  Is there anything similar to the old Youtube Remote for iOS?  <answer242056> ol liOn your PC/Mac, go to http://youtube.com/tv  (that's not your usual URL, it's the "Lean Back" mode)/li liGo to settings - Pair a Device (on the sidebar, on the PC)/li liOnce instructed to do so, go to your phone and just navigate to http://youtube.com/pair ... if you have the YouTube app, it will ask if you want to open on that app, say yes - if you don't - just move forward/li liPut the pair code from your PC into the pair box on the phone/li /ol  Presto - you're driving from your phone.  Essentially, "Lean Back" mode treats your PC like a TV, that's why it works.
