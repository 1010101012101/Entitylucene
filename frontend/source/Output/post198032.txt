how do I upgrade my processor on my MacBook Air? <body> I am trying to download a piece of equipment which requires at least a 1.8 Ghz processor. My MacBook Air has only 1.7 Ghz. Is it possible to upgrade it?  <answer198061> You don't. Mobile processors aren't necessarily made to be replaceable - often, they are soldered directly onto the logic board itself. Aside from the obvious voided warranty/extreme risk of damage to the board, you would need to either try the software for download to see if it'll actually run on your machine regardless of specs, or you will need to purchase a new laptop.  <answer198251> Sorry, the MacBook Air processor is soldered on and removing it would likely destroy the logic board. If you're looking for a powerful, yet relatively cheap laptop, get a used few-year-old MacBook Pro on eBay for a few hundred dollars (nothing too old, 2011 probably at the latest).  <answer210852> I remember that in the old days it was possible to fake change the CPU (through the terminal) in order for the OSX to report a faster CPU so that some software could be installed?  Maybe you could look into that? It will not give you a faster machine but might make install the software!  <comment236870> Welcome to Ask Different! No, it is not possible to update pretty much any notebook processor without very advanced equipment / knowledge, and it is usually not done. MacBook Air are particularly not design for upgrades of any kind. Take a look at this question regarding a PC CPU upgrade: http://superuser.com/questions/142886/upgrading-laptop-processor?rq=1 <comment236876> I'd just download it & try it - GHz is not the only measure of how fast a processor is. <comment372904> i tried this and broke my laptop <comment372932> Technically speaking, you *can* upgrade the processor, but it requires the use of a [BGA rework station](http://bit.ly/2i5018i); there are many shops that specialize in this type of work.  That said, the cost of doing this plus the cost of the components outweighs any benefits you may get; you'd be better off getting a replacement logic board or just getting a new(er) MacBook.
