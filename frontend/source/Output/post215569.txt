u flag with ps command <body> According to the Mac man page for codeps/code it says for the code-u/code flag:  precode-u      Display the processes belonging to the specified usernames. /code/pre  However, it seems to display different information rather than just being attached to usernames. E.g. here's the headers for codeax/code:  precodePID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND /code/pre  and here are the headers for codeaux/code:  precodeUSER              PID  %CPU %MEM      VSZ    RSS   TT  STAT STARTED      TIME COMMAND /code/pre  Any idea why? Is the man page incorrect?  <answer215572> They're both sort of correct. There's a difference between codeps u/code and codeps -u/code. Consider:  precode$ ps -u blm   UID   PID TTY           TIME CMD   502  4278 ??         0:00.04 sshd: blm@ttys000   ...  $ ps u blm ps: illegal argument: blm usage: ps [-AaCcEefhjlMmrSTvwXx] [-O fmt | -o fmt] [-G gid[,gid...]]           [-u]           [-p pid[,pid...]] [-t tty[,tty...]] [-U user[,user...]]        ps [-L] /code/pre  Also:  precode$ ps aux USER              PID  %CPU %MEM      VSZ    RSS   TT  STAT STARTED      TIME COMMAND root                1   1.9  0.1  2455856   4648   ??  Ss   Wed05PM   2:52.80 / ...  $ ps -aux ps: No user named 'x' /code/pre  The man page documents the options preceded by code-/code, but ps (for compatibility with other Unix flavors) also takes options without a preceding code-/code, with often completely different meanings.  In the manual page, go down to codeLEGACY DESCRIPTION/code for more information.
