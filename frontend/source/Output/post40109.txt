Encrypted HFS+ on Windows <body> I've been trying to open an encrypted (FileVault 2) HFS+ external hard disk on Windows 7. Since all the software available seem not able to do it, I've tried by installing the bootcamp drivers on Windows. First manually (placing codeAppleHFS.sys/code and codeAppleMNT.sys/code into codesystem32/drivers/code and adding the proper regedit keys) and then, since this didn't work, using the whole bootcamp installer. When I connect the drive, it's still unrecognized (even in the Drive Manager). What should I do? (or maybe: is it possible?)  <answer40263> Apple's BootCamp drivers do not have the driver or other software support needed to mount a volume using FileVault 2's encryption (otherwise known as CoreStorage encryption.)   To the best of my knowledge, there's no way to unlock and mount a CoreStorage encrypted volume on any OS except by using a Mac running Mac OS X 10.7.x.  <comment45527> Thank you. :) I'll just give up and share another disk. :P
