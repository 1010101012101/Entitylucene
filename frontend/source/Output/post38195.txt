Show windows program icons (.exe) in Mac OS X Lion? <body> I'm using codewine/code to run windows programs on OS X, however it would like to be able to see the icons of the programs.  I remember that I had something that did this on Snow Leopard, but I can't remember what it was and I don't think it is compatible with Lion.  I don't want to do this manually!  <comment43264> Do you mean you want to show the original .exe icons in the dock? Please clarify what you mean. <comment43272> Crossover creates "fake apps" that are actually shortcuts to the installed windows app, which lies in some obscure folder and needs to be executed alongside WINE. If you use Crossover I suggest talking to tech support, as it may be a bug with Lion. <comment43284> I want it to show the original icon of the exe in Finder, but I don't want to create a fake app or put it in the dock. I don't want to wrap the exe inside an app. <comment43290> @Tyilo unfortunately I believe that's how it works. It is quite straight forward to change an icon though, I'm sure there are many questions/answers on here if you need pointers for that. <comment43299> @Robin I had some kind of extension that did **exactly** what I want on Snow Leopard. I have forgotten what its name was.
