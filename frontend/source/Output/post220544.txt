Check how much GB time machine's backup need to be restored? <body> I have:  ul liMain: working copy of Mac OS X the capitan, in a 1TB hard drive,/li liExternal: I have another external 1TB HD with the time machine copy,/li liNext Main?: Empty strong120GB/strong SSD HD/li /ul  After deleting all the files I don't need, I have 138GB of used space in my main  HD,  I'm thinking of restoring the Time machine backup to the SSD  My question is,  How Can I  know for sure if the backup fits in my 120GB Disk?  PD: I know anyway that I need to delete, at least, 20GB more, but the question would come back then..  <comment266954> At least 10-15% of free space are recommended. So you would have to delete another 10 GB! <comment266955> Thanks! I know, but I mean, to be able to restore it; I will care about perfomance once I restored successfully
