Applescript - Run Multiple Instances of an App in Mac OSX <body> I was hoping one of you kind folks could help me write a script that would open another instance of Transmission.   From my online research, I took a stab at making my own and compiled the following script for AppleScript Editor.   precode do shell script "open -n -a '/Volumes/2 TB/App/Transmission.app'" /code/pre  However, I get the following error message:      There is already a copy of Transmission running. This copy cannot be   opened until that instance is quit.   Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?  <answer99666> You would need to compile your own transmission-daemon to be able to run multiple instances. Once you have done this you can specify different ports on each instance and start them up.

You might be able to run multiple Transmission daemons. I'm not 100% sure if that's possible, but on Linux I run Transmission headless. To do so, they would each have to listen on different ports. <comment117261> Having said that, BitTorrent is designed to max out the utilization of your connection with only a single client. Why do you want to run more than one?
