Move focus to another display with keyboard <body> I'm using Yosemite. I have two external displays with several spaces (I like the idea one app per space). Sometimes I want to move focus to another display without using a mouse. I have few solutions but they are not ideal.  ul likbdcmd/kbd+kbdF4/kbd emMove focus to next or another window/em in System Preferences - it moves focus but mouse still stays on previous display so moving spaces does not work properly (kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&larr;/kbdorkbd&rarr;/kbd moves spaces on previous display)/li liBetterTouchTool can move mouse, but mouse position should be hardcoded. What is more moving a mouse does not cause moving the focus, you should click additionally and it's not always good/li likbdctrl/kbd+kbdn/kbd can move to emn/em space, but it does not work if space is opened on another screen e.g. if space 1 is focused on display 1 and space 2 is opened on display 2 then pressing kbdctrl/kbd+kbd2/kbd does not move focus, but pressing kbdctrl/kbd+kbd3/kbd and then kbdctrl/kbd+kbd2/kbd does (if space 3 is created on display 2)/li /ul  Do you have any ideas?  <answer211711> Nevermind, I found an app which does it - Amethyst. I've been looking for something like that for ages
