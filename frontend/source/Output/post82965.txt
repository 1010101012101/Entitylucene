What impact will a dropping Internet connection have on an in-progress iCloud backup? <body> We are in an area where there is extensive construction going on so internet connectivity to our building is frequently interrupted. My iPhone 5 is set to backup to iCloud. I am connected to a local WiFi router in my office for said internet connectivity. If my iPhone 5 is in the middle of an iCloud backup will the backup fail outright and attempt to perform a backup at a later time (when internet connectivity is restored / present) or will it pause and resume when connectivity is restored.   <answer82972> iCloud backups are incremental. You'll continue to complete backups when connectivity is restored.
