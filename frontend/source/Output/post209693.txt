VPN connects, IP won't change : traffic issue <body> I spent too much time on this, so I'm asking you guys if you can figure it out. I can connect to my VPN, but my IP won't change (I can access the internet) and since P2P isn't working I guess the traffic isn't going through the VPN, which is problematical.  ul liIP : 129.104.219.226 /li liGateway : 255.255.252.0 /li liRouter : 129.104.219.253/li liand a specific DNS and proxy from my school network/li /ul  VPN (VPNFacile with Viscosity on OS X) when connected:  ul liClient IP : 10.61.0.86/li liServer IP : 129.104.247.2/li /ul  My VPN is well-configured (I mean, DNS+proxy) since I copied the configurations (.ovpn files) of some friends of mine who have the same VPN, and tweaked them in every way possible.  I have tried:  ul liAdding push "redirect-gateway def1", redirect-gateway def1, route-delay 20 to my configuration files/li liFlushing dns and routes/li liUpdating OSX/li liChanging VPN client/li liTick "Send all traffic through VPN" in Viscosity/li liTweak the route parameters/li /ul  After listing the routes from a fresh start, this is what I've got:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Mo3k.png" alt="Route table without VPN"  And after connecting the VPN a few seconds after, this is what I've got: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jKrRU.png" alt="Route table with VPN"
