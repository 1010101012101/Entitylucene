Mavericks+: (Desktop Wallpaper) How can I use both the Apple Desktop Pictures and a local folder? <body> I enjoy the built in wallpapers that are shipped with Mavericks, but I also want to supplant those with the wallpapers that I have within my user folder.  In System Preferences - Desktop &amp; Screen Saver, the option only appears to be EITHER the Apple - Desktop Pictures OR Folders - My local wallpaper folder.  Does anyone know of a way to blend the two and have both sets cycle through?  <answer120535> You can move your wallpapers into code/Library/Desktop Pictures//code and have them in single location. This shouldn’t affect the system because I have the wallpapers since Leopard and each OS update only include more wallpapers.  Go ahead and include yours in there. Make sure you make a backup of code/Library/Desktop Pictures//code just in case you want to revert them back to default state.  <comment140913> Or move the ones in /Library to your User Library, where you won’t run in to permissions snags.
