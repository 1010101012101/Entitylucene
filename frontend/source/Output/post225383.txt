Keyboard layout changed <body> For no apparent reason my Mac mini keyboard has just changed its placement of symbols: For example, whenever I type Shift+2, expecting the @ symbol to appear, I get a " character instead. Language has always been set to British. Nothing to my knowledge has been changed. I am using OSX Yosemite version 10.10.5. How do I get my keyboard back to how it was please?   <answer225410> Go to system preferences/keyboard/input sources and remove the item called "British PC" and make sure only the item called "British" is there.  <comment273470> System Preferences  Keyboard  Input sources  check *Show input menu in the bar*. What is the flag country that appears on the top bar? <comment273690> Britsh and underneath British PC <comment273692> Thanks Tom this has worked!!!!
