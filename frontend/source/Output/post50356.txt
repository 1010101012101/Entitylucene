Clarify costs on my credit card printout when buying apps.  <body> I have a iPad 2. In my credit card printout, I have a cost from an app I bought in the AppStore. But I've only installed free apps.  If I lookup what apps I've installed, I cannot see their costs, because I can only see "Installed" information. How can I see the App price when I install it?  Or there is a way to check what I bought and what is charged me?  <answer50358> If you open iTunes and navigate to emStore &lt; Show account/em, there is a history of what you bought including the date and price for every transaction.  I'm sorry for the Dutch language in the screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xo7Ar.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment57746> Michiel's answer is correct; also Apple sends receipts via email, so you can search for that as well.
