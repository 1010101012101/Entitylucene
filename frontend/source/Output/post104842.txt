The volume can't be ejected because it's currently in use <body> After working with an external USB backup disk I want to cleanly unmount the drive. When pressing the 'eject' button Finder warns me with the message:  ul li"strongThe volume can't be ejected because it's currently in use./strong"/li /ul  or  ul li"strongThe disk "Diskname" wasn't ejected because one or more programs may be using it./strong"./li /ul  or when trying to use the Terminal: codeumount /Volumes/Diskname/code  ul li"strongumount(/Volumes/Diskname): Resource busy -- try 'diskutil unmount'/strong"/li /ul  As far as I am aware, I am not using this disk but Finder says I do, so I must be wrong. I prefer a clean unmount of the drive. As I am in the middle of doing multiple tasks, logging out and logging in is not preferred as is the installation of third party software.  Terminal command codelsof/code might be of use here, but personally I think this is too complex for such a 'simple' problem and to be honest, I do not know how to use it properly.  My question: How do I know what program is using my drive so I can properly quit that program and eject my drive? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9vw3.png" alt="The volume can&#39;t be ejected because it&#39;s currently in use." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIeIz.png" alt="The disk &quot;Camel&quot; wasn&#39;t ejected because one or more programs may be using it." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OcTZ.png" alt="The disk &quot;Mammtoh&quot; wasn&#39;t ejected because one or more programs..."  <answer104850> codelsof/code is indeed your best bet the fastest and easiest way would be this :-  precodesudo lsof | grep /Volumes/myDrive /code/pre  which gives you a list of open files on the disk.  <answer104869> You could try the donationware application "What's Keeping me?" that shows what process/application is using the volume/folder/file.  This program is certified by the developer for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, but the RoaringApps page for this application lists it as working fine on OS X 10.7 Lion and OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.     h3About What's Keeping Me?/h3      Have you ever have the problem where you can’t empty the Trash or eject a disk because something is preventing you? Usually the reason is because some application has a file open, and thus you can’t get rid of the disk or trash the file. That’s why we made What’s Keeping Me! What’s Keeping Me will identify the application that is holding the item open. You can then use What's Keeping Me to quit the problem application (or kill it if needed) so you can perform your task. What’s Keeping Me includes an Automator workflow so you can perform searches directly from the Finder too!   <answer107767> I've had this message emdespite being sure there are no open files on the volume/em. I checked this with Why Not Unmount, a GUI tool that can indicate open files on a disk.    In my case, it was a sign that the file system is corrupt. Running Disk Utility (or if that wasn't enough, DiskWarrior) solved the problem and made the disk ejectable again.    <answer129244> Have you tried code$ diskutil unmount /Volumes/Diskname/code ?  Or code$ diskutil unmount force /Volumes/Diskname/code ?  As the manpage points out:     Due to the complex and interwoven nature of Mac OS X, umount may fail often.  It is recommended that        diskutil(1) (as in, "diskutil unmount /mnt") be used instead.   If your volume has spaces in the name, be sure to escape the spaces with code\/code, eg:  precode$ diskutil unmount /Volumes/Disk\ Name /code/pre  Or use quotes to avoid confusion.  precode$ diskutil unmount "/Volumes/Disk Name" /code/pre  <answer138799> I restarted my Mac and that fixed it :-)  <answer142460> Your problem is probably caused by the process codemds/code : Spotlight indexing your disk.  I have this problem, and I have not found a solution (yet).  <answer166760> Solution Make sure all programs are closed. Click the Apple icon in the top left of the screen, then click Force Quit. In the list click Finder. Now click the Relaunch button. Then try ejecting the drive again.  <answer175170> strongThere is a GUI alternative/strong to the CLI app codelsof/code:br fseventer is a great file system access monitoring utility for strongvarious purposes/strong. It runs with super user permissions (codesudo/code), so it sees all read/write access of all mounted file systems, and presents them in a very clear overview.  strongMy experience:/strong I had a Volume which constantly could not be ejected properly (as in the OP's screenshots), and always needed a "force eject", sometimes even a forceful physical disconnection (nor recommended! could damage your filesystem(s) on that disk) or a system shutdown to bypass that brute method.  strongMy fix:/strong Summarized: emThe ejection issue can be caused by corrupted or legacy file content on that Volume. Removing the troubled content can fix this permanently./em In detail:  ol liDetermine which file is accessed (with codelsof/code or  fseventer). emIn my case it was a Classic Mac OS file with a resource fork that remained open, likely as some background disk parsing process (Spotlight, QuickLook, or thelike) hung on it./em/li liBackup that troubling data into a file archive (which preserves (Classic) Mac specific resource data). emI simply used Finder's native "Compress" function from it's context menu./em/li liDelete the troubled file/folder.  ul liWith Finder as usual. emLikely this will fail, as it's a "troubled file/folder"./em/li liWith Finder plus holding down ALT while emptying the Trash. emThis creates a little more force, but likely it will still fail./em/li liThrough the Terminal with codesudo rm -R /path/to/troublesome/FileOrFolder/code. emThis eventually worked after Finder's delete attempts have failed./em/li /ul/li liTry unmounting the volume again. emIt may still fail, as the background processes, which failed, could be still in a irrecoverable state/em./li liRestart. Then try unmounting again. emFrom then forth the Volume worked fine again. Normal mounting, unmounting, read/write operations. Only when a file was indeed open by a user process, unmounting was prevented. Perfectly normal behaviour again./em/li /ol  <answer200097> Both the command line solution and What's Keeping Me work great.  To recap, command line in terminal is:  precodelsof | grep /Volumes/myDrive /code/pre  The GUI application is What's Keeping Me, available at Hamsoft Engineering.  Screenshots of both with the same search going on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yfWrl.png" alt="Command line output" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4oQBZ.png" alt="GUI for What&#39;s Keeping Me"  I prefer the command line just slightly, as it's always there with you. On the other hand, What's Keeping Me is quicker and easier to use if you've got it installed.  <answer207363> Try to relaunch the Finder. Here it works  <comment123354> I found this as well, but I hoped someone has a non terminal solution. If not, you'll get your plus one ;) <comment123393> This looks like valid software, but I really prefer OS X native solutions. <comment123419> By native you mean something Apple provides? There's nothing like that on the GUI front. Plus, WKM has been around for several years. <comment123700> Thanks for your addition. Native is not the correct word, what I meant was 'non-third party'. WKM is a nice solution, but personally I prefer lsof. <comment148606> In my case, the system was not corrupt. <comment151313> I believe I tried this and it did not work. But next time I'll try it again and update my post accordingly. <comment164077> [lsof without sudo may **not** produce the required output](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/76305/8546). <comment164737> I prefer a clean unmount of the drive. As I am in the middle of doing multiple tasks, logging out and logging in is not preferred as is the installation of third party software. <comment167715> "As far as I am aware, I am not using this disk but Finder says I do, so I must be wrong." You trust machines too much. ;-) Often, computers are wrong and we humans are right. <comment167716> Your example has quotes, not apostrophes. Which is a good thing. <comment167754> So what you are saying is that I am right? ;) <comment168364> Opposite question : [*apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52959/how-do-i-not-accidentally-eject-external-drives*](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52959/how-do-i-not-accidentally-eject-external-drives) <comment168675> → Paul: I'd suggest you to improve your suggested command as: `/usr/bin/sudo lsof /Volumes/myDrive` <comment168690> @NicolasBarbulesco: Thanks for pointing that out, I made corrections to the answer. Good catch! <comment170011> @danielAzuelos, why should one need super user rights for listing mounts? <comment211600> Worked -      sudo diskutil unmount force /Volumes/Diskname <comment212004> @tgkprog Glad to hear it, also thanks for the `sudo` command, that may help others as well. <comment215331> @CousinCocaine please follow the link in my comment above. You'll be able to see for yourself. <comment241637> Did you see this solution work? <comment255446> And if Spotlight is the culprit, save yourself some repetition: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/211616/15417 <comment259759> Oh excellent, I did lsof without sudo which gives a totally different set of results. <comment269685> This provided the process id I had to `kill`. <comment271875> Yep, sudo is definitely needed in a lot of cases. In my case this revealed that it was due to Spotlight trying to index the disk, so the solution was to disable Spotlight for the disk, then manually stop/restart Spotlight. <comment271876> It should go without saying, but this forcing an unmount should be avoided except as a last resort, and shouldn't be needed if you use the sudo lsof approach as suggested in the other answer. <comment271877> Seems unlikely. More likely Spotlight, or some other app or service has a lock on the disk.
