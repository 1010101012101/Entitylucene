Use LaunchControl to run pg_dump in a ruby file <body> Using Mac OSX 10.12.5, I have a ruby file with the following contents  precode#!/usr/bin/env ruby Dir.chdir('/Users/my_files') do   system("pg_dump -Fc --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U MyName development &gt; backup_file.dump") end /code/pre  it works if I run it from the command line, but if I run it from LaunchControl I get the following error:  precodesh: pg_dump: command not found /code/pre  How do I fix this?  <answer287546> Thanks to klanomath's comment, the problem is that I am not putting the full file path to codepg_dump/code.  codepg_dump/code is a utility of postgresql which was installed using homebrew. So in my case I did codebrew info postgresql/code which told me the path to postgresql.  In the bin directory I found codepgdump/code.  I also put in the full path to where I wanted codebackup_file/code saved. This was found by changing to that directory and typing codepwd/code.  <comment363061> Use the full path for pg_dump (and probably also for the file backup_file.dump)!
