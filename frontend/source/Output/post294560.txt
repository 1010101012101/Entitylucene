Terminus font looks crooked/skewed <body> I like this font and it's my default on Linux, so I tried to start using it on macOS (Sierra) too. The result is pretty awful and I don't understand why, in particular what puzzles me most is the fact that the lines are not parallel/perpendicular.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F2erZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I suspect that this concerns the fact that originally Terminus is a bitmap font, but I don't know what to try next.  Do you have any ideas?  <answer294581> Probably this has something to do with it:     h2About the outlines/h2      There are applications that neither support the original Terminus Font nor use bitmaps embedded in TrueType fonts. They completely rely on the automatically generated scalable outlines.      When Terminus TTF is used with such applications, it will probably look a little bit weird and not exactly like the original Terminus Font (since the generated outlines do not exactly match the bitmaps); you will see whether you like it or not. Because the outlines are scalable, it should not matter which size you use, but anything bigger than 32 px (24 pt) will probably not look very nice. I have no idea how sizes smaller than 12 px (9 pt) look; feel free to report back.
