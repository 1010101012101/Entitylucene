There is no photo library but pictures are still visible in Photos app <body> I learnt that by default the Photos app maintains a photo library within the pictures folder of my user account on my MacBook Pro. However, there is no such library in the pictures folder. I have searched thoroughly, but cannot find it in any other location either! Even so, my Photos app still displays my photos.   What could be the reason for this? Where's my Photos Library?  <answer275980> The default location for the photo library is code~/Pictures//code, but it's possible that it's different for you. Open the Photos app, open the Preferences pane and the General tab will show you the location of your photo library.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tbJdn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer276014> What happens if you try either of the following...  strongMethod 1/strong  This basically adds on the answer by Glorfindel:  ul liLaunch the Photos App/li liGo to Photos  Preferences/li liSelect the General tab/li liClick on the kbdShow in Finder/kbd button that appears below the Library Location path/li /ul  Does that open the folder in the Finder, thereby revealing it to you?  strongMethod 2/strong  If the first method doesn't work, try this instead:  ul liEnsure Photos is strongnot/strong already running/li liPress and hold the kbdoption/kbd key down/li liLaunch the Photos app, still keeping the kbdoption/kbd key down/li liLet go of the kbdoption/kbd key when you see the Choose Library window/li liThis window gives you a number of options, however the last opened Photos Library should be highlighted on the list.
