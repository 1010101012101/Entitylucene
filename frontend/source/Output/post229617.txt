Share screen on Mac/iPhone without having Apple TV <body> I am gonna to have a telephone with my customer to present our first milestone of one app we are building for customer (I am a PO). I have to call him by telephone and I want to share my iphone screen via Mac in realtime. I googled and there is AirPlay with Apply TV. But I don't have Apple TV.  Is there any alternative way I can do that? Thanks in advance   <answer229618> You can connect the iPhone to Mac via USB and then open strongQuickTime/strong. There's strongNew Movie Recording/strong - Select iPhone as a video source. Then You can simply share Your Mac screen with the customer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3jRpW.png" alt="enter image description here"
