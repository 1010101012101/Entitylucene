Change desktop of another display <body> So kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdleft/right/kbd switches the desktop for the display where my mouse pointer is, is there a way to do that for another display without having to move the pointer over?  <answer219802> You can enable shortcuts for directly switching to a desired Desktop in Keyboard Shortcuts under system preferences.   For example you can enable switching to Desktop 1 by pressing kbdCTRL/kbdkbd1/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cokyd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment265854> How does this switch the desktop *for a different monitor*? <comment265866> There is a unique number assigned to each desktop spanning all displays. (assuming El Capitan) <comment265872> I didn't downvote, but the keys don't work for me unless my mouse is on the display that I want to change the display on. Must just be something with my setup. <comment266000> @grgarside 'Displays have separate spaces' needs to enabled from System Preferences-Mission Control <comment266012> @sdayal - the user must already have that option set to be able to switch one screen at a time. I actually don't think what the OP wants is possible. <comment266020> @Tetsujin, well I am using 2 additional display monitors and have 2 desktops on each (total 6) and I am able to switch to any desktop using crtl+num key combination with my mouse pointer on any screen. <comment266022> How does it know which screen you wish to switch? That's the crux of the question. <comment266023> @Tetsujin, If you bring the mission control up (using F3 or 4-finger swipe up) you can see all the desktops listed with numbers (from 1 to 6 in my case) on the top part of the screen. Once I see the numbering screen of each monitor, I just press the ctrl+num for that desktop to bring that up. <comment266026> OK, I've just tried it - I've always hated screens having separate spaces… & I still do. I just cannot work that way. It does seem that once you've assigned a Space to a screen, it 'lives' on that screen. It also renumbers it!! That's not going to be any way I'd ever want to work. Now to try put everything back where it belongs. Wish I'd never started… :( <comment266054> @Tetsujin, Thanks for verifying. I don't use these either, just had experimented it once before. I hope our discussion will help Jeffrey04.
