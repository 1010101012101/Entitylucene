What iOS camera apps produce realistic HDRs? <body> Many HDR photos have an over-processed look with colors that are oversaturated and otherwise unrealistic, halos, excessive texture and local contrast, and so on. I don't like that.  What camera apps exist on iOS that capture realistic HDR photos?  They can use exposure fusion, or tone-mapping, or some other algorithm, as long as the result is natural-looking. I care about the result, not the algorithm.  <answer254568> I am not sure if this will stay posted since it requires a recommendation.  strongI use VividHDR/strong and have dumped my desktop program for this gem.   strongIt uses 5 shots/strong unlike my previous 3 shot and the results are amazing. A user can still make it look unrealistic with tone-mapping settings but other than that I think you should look into.  hr  strongApp features:/strong  strongFull resolution HDR images./strong  strongUniversal app/strong  strongTake 3 or 5 bracketed shots/strong or just leave it to us to decide.
