Apps take forever to start on OS X Mavericks <body> Ever since I upgraded my main machine to Mavericks, every time I open a new app, two things happen:  ol lithe app takes a long time to open;/li lithe whole system slows to a crawl until the app opens completely./li /ol  The interesting part is that this happens on an early 2011 MacBook Pro (with 4GB of RAM), while on an older machine (mid/late 2007 MBP with 2GB of RAM), also updated to Mavericks, everything is a breeze—it’s surreal! (Both machines were upgraded from Snow Leopard.)  And on top of that, Safari is completely broken—see my previous question.  What I’ve done so far:  ul lirepaired permissions;/li licleared system and user cache;/li lireseted the SMC;/li liran AppleJack;/li /ul  What can I possibly do to make it work as it should?  <answer110811> I suggest you reinstall the application. If all goes wrong, then just reinstall Mavericks. My MBP (mid 2012) takes FOREVER to start up but the apps work just fine.  <answer110835> I would suggest emclean install/em of Mavericks (make sure you back up your data first) from a bootable USB install drive.  There is also step by step guide available.  <answer128486> When I see things like this I often suspect disk problems. (This is a HDD, correct?) The first symptoms of soft disk errors are often bad performance.  Open the Console and see if you see any disk errors. Also try booting into a Super Duper clone. Since a clone will have the same files, any problem would continue if it were a configuration problem. But if the problem goes away, it was likely a problem with the physical drive. As a bonus, a clone is exactly what you will need if you have a physical drive problem.  <answer134908> I did a clean install. The first day it was o.k., but then opening apps takes a long time, watching the bouncing app-icons in the dock.   ol liMavericks fresh install (external HDs kept disconnected, two displays attached)/li liiWork (from CD) /li liAdobe CS4 /li liiCloud activated/li liCanon printer driver/li /ol  After i gave up when recurring the old behavior i installed back much other stuff, it can´t hurt anymore. Watching the ever bouncing app-icons in the dock, again. Crap.  <answer162610> Buy a solid state drive.  Yeah, I know, expensive but EXCELLENT.  If you want an external usb 3 make sure the case has UASP. Very important.   <comment126066> Does this happen with every application, or just a select few? <comment126067> Have you checked the disk for errors ? My 2012 MBP is faster than Mountain Lion with Mavericks. <comment126069> @JW8 As far as I can tell, with every application. And also, it happens _every_ time I open them, not just the first time after a fresh restart. <comment126070> @PratikaRana It was part of AppleJack set of utilities, so yes. <comment140104> That’s one thing I’m trying to avoid. <comment150467> There are 2 great tools to start with debugging. One is the Activity Monitor to see who, what, the second one is the Console log.
