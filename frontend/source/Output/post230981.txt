Changing style parameters of highlighted text in Apple Pages <body> Why is it that I highlight a blob of text and set it to align to the right of the screen, other previously written text that is not highlighted also snaps to the right?  <comment282004> If the previous text is part of the same paragraph then I believe it's normal that it too justifies the selected direction. <comment282014> If I set the alignment, it just shifts all text over.  Say I type one sentence and under style create a new style called "style1".  Then a second sentence and apply a new "style2" to that.  The style stays fixed in the format pane and all changes apply to everything.
