Can I make an OS X ESD (or other USB drive) read-only? <body> I have a USB Flash drive onto which I've used Disk Utility to restore the Mac OS X Install ESD:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQX8Q.png" alt="Mac OS X Install ESD Finder Info window"  Is there a way I can make the result read-only, in order offer it at lease some semblance of protection from accidental change?  I assume (but don't know for sure) that I cannot make the raw disk itself read-only, so higher levels of protection are okay, but the lower the better.  <answer98128> One thing I have tried is using Sharing &amp; Permissions to set rights to codeRead only/code for myself, like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGV86.png" alt="Sharing &amp; Permissions section of Mac OS X Install ESD Info window with all rights set to Read only"  This prevents some writes:  precodemegaweapon:Mac OS X Install ESD matt$ touch foo touch: foo: Permission denied /code/pre  but if I try to make modifications through the Finder, I'm prompted for my password for administrative access.  Unfortunately, this is not a hard defense against write access.  To accomplish this, a USB stick with a write lock switch (hard to find) or perhaps an SD card in a reader might work.  <answer110479> Use Disk Utility to convert the image to a read only type image rather than a read/write type image.  Open Disk Utility, click the "Convert" button, chose your disk image file, change "Image Format" to "read-only" and press "Save."  Disk Utility will make a new copy of the image file that can't be modified.  Just make sure you label them so they're easy to tell apart.  <comment115195> Because I was impressed by this answer, I tried it.  Unfortunately, while it still boots, the filesystem itself was still writable. http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/24120/21050 <comment130167> I'm not clear how this would apply to a USB drive.
