How to determine where mysterious users on OS X Lion Server are coming from? <body> A while back I installed OS X Lion Server and migrated some data across from Snow Leopard Server.  When I accessed the server using "Server Admin" and to my shock noticed that 5 accounts (displayed in the format of UUID) in the Access list. All the real users are accounted for.  I can't see these accounts being used in any other application, other than the "Access" tab in "Server Admin".  What tools on OS X Lion Server can I use to determine whether these are real accounts, or perhaps something left over when I migrated data from Snow Leopard Server?   <comment48227> It may well be a result of data migration, especially if this is the only place you see them.
