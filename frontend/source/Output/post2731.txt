How can I copy the path of a file in Finder? <body> How can I copy the path to a folder or a file? The Info Dialog doesn't allow me to copy the information that stands there ...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6uwLZ.png" alt="alt text"  Is there an easy way to do this?  <answer2734> I will move my comment over as an answer.  You should be able to copy the path to a folder/file by highlighting the value next to "Where:" in the info dialog and pressing codeCMD+c/code.   An easier alternative that requires less effort is right-clicking on that value, and clicking "Copy" in the drop-down that appears.   <answer2739> There are two ways I do this (and the info window is neither of them):  ol liOpen the Terminal application and drag the item into the window, and a POSIX-style path will be displayed that you can copy and paste./li liUse Applescript.../li /ol  ...select an item in the Finder and run this...  precodetell application "Finder"     return info for selection as alias end tell /code/pre  ...or create a droplet with this code...  precodeon open theFile    set thePath to POSIX path of theFile    set the clipboard to thePath as text end open /code/pre  Add salt to taste.  <answer2745> As already described by ayaz, the Get Info window (kbdcmd/kbd+kbdi/kbd) has the full path and will allow you to copy it. If you emtripple/em click in the highlighted area (by the red rectangle) the selection will automatically expand to the whole path. kbdcmd/kbd + kbdc/kbd will suffice to copy it to the clipboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xI3sX.jpg" alt="get info window"  If you need the path to interact with the Terminal, you can always check one of the “zillion” answers in this Stack Overflow Question.   strongUPDATE/strong: This method seems to be only valid for OS X 10.6.x, previous OS X versions used the non-POSIX path style that looked like path:to:file, whereas the POSIX would be path/to/file. If you are in something older than OS X 10.6, you will have to try one of the other methods described in the other answers (or upgrade to 10.6 ;)  <answer2765> ol liStart automator/li liCreate a new service /li liSet the service to acquire files and folder in the finder, and add the run applescript element/li liPaste this script  precodeon run {input, parameters} set mylist to {} repeat with elem in input     try         set the end of mylist to (POSIX path of (elem as alias))     end try end repeat set oldtid to AppleScript's text item delimiters   set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {return} set flatlist to mylist as text   set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldtid   tell application "Finder" to set the clipboard to flatlist   -- code below will also create an email with the path inside. delete it if you don't want that. tell application "Microsoft Entourage"     set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:myFileName, content:flatlist}     open theMessage     activate end tell end run /code/pre/li liSave the result as 'copy and email path' or something./li liNow check your ctrl-click menu and your services menu. Nice!/li /ol  <answer2797> Sometimes the solution is so simple.  Just mark the file in the finder and then press Command-C. The path including the file name is copied to the clipboard and you can paste it in any application.  <answer19341> This is how to create a Service to copy to the clipboard the selected paths in Finder:  ol liOpen Automator. Press ⌘+N and choose Service./li liSet "Service receives selected codefiles or folders/code in codeFinder.app/code"./li liDrag the element "Run Shell Script" to the window.br emNote: You can select this element if you go to the left of the window and click on Actions, Library, and type part of the name in the search box./em/li liSet "Shell: code/bin/bash/code", "Pass input: codeas arguments/code" and type the following in the script box: codefor f in "$@" do echo "$f" done/code./li liDrag the element Copy to Clipboard./li liSave your service in code~/Library/Services/Copy POSIX Paths.workflow/code (or any other name you like)./li /ol  Now you will be able to run this service if you right click an element and choose Services  Copy POSIX Paths. It will copy the file(s) selected in Finder to your clipboard. I tested this on Lion.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fsmN1.png" alt="Automator"  I got this tip from Kris Johnson's Blog.  <answer58926> Simply drag the file into text editor, and it will give you the full path for that file.  <answer249269> The best and easiest way to do this is by creating a "copy path" service, very similar to the kbdshift/kbd + Right-Click on a Windows machine.  If you frequently need to copy and paste file and folder paths, creating an Automator Service will make your life easier because the service then becomes accessible from the OS X Right-Click contextual menu, accessible from anywhere in the Finder.  Follow these steps to set it up  (screenshots below).  ol liLaunch Automator/li liCreate a new “Service” /li liUse the search function to look for “Copy to Clipboard” and drag that into the rightsize panel of the Service Set ‘Service receives selected’ to “files or folders” and ‘in’ to “Finder”./li liSave the Service with a name like “Copy Path”.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XGGXM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  The result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FD1UE.png" alt="enter image description here"  You'll now have the textual path in your clipboard.  Sources: CNet, OSX Daily  <answer249285> Right click on the file, hold down kbdAlt/Option/kbd, and an item to copy file path will appear as codeCopy "&lt;FILENAME&gt;" as Pathname/code.  This is the easiest option for day to day usage, without involving Automator.   This seems to be a relatively new feature that was added in OS X El Capitan. (It also works on macOS Sierra).  <comment2418> Are you not able to highlight the value next to "Where:" and press `CMD+c` to copy it? <comment2420> @ayaz consider writing that as an answer, since it's probably the best way to do what he's asking :) <comment2422> Doesn't work for me... <comment2431> I don't know why but this doesn't work for me. There is no selection at all in this dialog. <comment2441> What OS version do you have? <comment2444> This doesn't work for me either, running 10.5.8 <comment2446> The info method not working might be a 10.5 vs. 10.6 issue. I just noticed for the first time that the path displayed is POSIX style and not the long-standing "path:to:file" style. <comment2463> Any application that [cannot receive files or file contents after a drap and drop](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DragandDrop/Tasks/DraggingFiles.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001288-CEGJFDFG) will give you the filename instead. So this not only works with Terminal, but also with TextEdit or other "simple" apps. <comment2473> which version are you on? If I right click on the path, I get the standard edit menu with `Copy` in it <comment2562> I just got the filename in the clipboard. How Do You get the full path ? <comment2584> In the finder, click once on the filename or the icon so that the file is highlighted (if you can change the filename now, you clicked to often and you must press Escape to cancel the rename operation). Then press Command-C. <comment2621> doesn't work for me either, just the filename is copied. <comment2631> I just checked it. It works when pasting into Terminal but not into TextEdit.  Dragging and dropping a file into Terminal pastes the filename and path. Dito in TextEdit. What about other applications? <comment255967> Related: [How I can copy to the clipboard the path (or the full url) of a file or a folder?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119958/how-i-can-copy-to-the-clipboard-the-path-or-the-full-url-of-a-file-or-a-folder/)
