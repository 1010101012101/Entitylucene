Roll back to Mountain Lion but don't lose saved documents <body> I have a Time Machine backup of my system from last week right before I installed Mavericks. I've determined that Mavericks breaks too many programs that I need to use and doesn't add enough features (yet) for me to want to be using it, so I want to roll back to Mountain Lion.  BUTâ€¦ (there's always a but, right? I suppose if there weren't, I wouldn't be asking here) here's the catch:  I haven't plugged in my Time Machine drive since upgrading. I have saved documents in the past week. If I were to just roll back to last week's backup, I'd lose all the work I've done since upgrading.  Can I safely run a Time Machine backup under Mavericks, revert to last week's backup, and then restore individual files from the Mavericks backup? Do I need to be buying another external drive to first back up this week's system, then restore last week's system, then pull files? What needs to happen here to restore my system to ML without losing a week's work?  <answer107453> Yes, you can safely backup with codeTime Machine/code in OS X Mavericks and restore your newer files later when you're back on OS X Mountain Lion.  ul liComplete a backup using codeTime Machine/code on OS X Mavericks to get your new/updated files into the backup/li liReboot the machine with the codeTime Machine/code disk connected/li liAt startup, hold kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd to get into Recovery mode (or hold kbdOption/kbd to select the volume to boot from and choose the Recovery HD from the codeTime Machine/code disk)/li liChoose strongRestore From Time Machine Backup/strong from the list of actions/li liSelect the codeTime Machine/code volume and then the backup dated before the upgrade that you wish to restore from (it will show you a list of all available backups)/li liAfter booting into the OS X Mountain Lion system, turn off codeTime Machine/code in strongSystem Preferences  Time Machine/strong (to avoid another backup starting soon, thus slowing down the system and adding to the cognitive load on you to choose the correct versions to restore)/li liBrowse the codeTime Machine/code disk from the codeTime Machine/code interface and pick the specific files from the latest backup to restore/li liTurn on codeTime Machine/code again in strongSystem Preferences/strong/li /ul  <comment126057> I'm going to try this. I hope I don't mess anything up! <comment126092> just out of curiosity, what does Mavericks break? I'm debating whether or not to upgrade... <comment126101> iMovie HD gets all crashy on me. <comment126632> I was also frustrated at the loss of the ability of the Finder to open folders in new windows, and the fact that full screen quick look images weren't scaling properly.
