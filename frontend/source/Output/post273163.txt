Loud cracking noise through headphones, followed by no audio <body> Yesterday, while listening to the BBC radio iPlayer in Chrome, my Mac Book Pro made a frighteningly loud crack noise through my headphones. I have the volume set very low because I am using open backed headphones (Grado 325es)so it was quite a shock.  Today it's happened again, twice. If I refresh the browser the audio restarts fine.  What could be causing this audio failure and how do I fix it?  <comment343358> You have to diagnose whether it's your MacBook Pro or it's your headphones.  Plug your headphones into another device and see if it happens there (you will have to use the other device like you use your current setup - a few mins. won't work.)  The other option is to try a different headset/speaker with your MBP.  See which scenario reproduces the noise - until then, this question would be much too broad to attempt to answer. <comment343364> As a general tip: it might help to look in Console.app just after the cracking noise occurs. If it is some system fault it might get logged there.
