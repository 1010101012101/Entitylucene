How do SSH sessions work with iTerm? <body> When I use PuTTY on Windows, if I SSH to some server and launch a script there, closing the PuTTY window stops the script. (so I typically use codescreen/code to avoid that)  When I use iTerm on Mac OS X, if I SSH to some server and launch a script there, closing the iTerm window doesn't stop the script. How comes?  <comment247816> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247817> So I am still interested if someone has any idea. <comment300635> What's the exact version of your iTerm?
