How do you check how much current a Mac USB port can deliver? <body> This question is similar to the superuser question "How to check how much power a USB port can deliver", which is answered for Linux and Windows.   How do you check the same on a Mac?  <answer38655> The Knowledgebase article Apple Computers and Displays: Powering peripherals through USB contains some general guidelines and illustrates using System Profiler (System Information in Lion) to provide information about the output (according to specifications) of a Macs USB ports.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RbIO0.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want to test the real world voltage output of a given USB port on an individual Macintosh at a given load you will have to use a test device. (USB Test Circuit)  <answer38899> Simply open About this Mac - More Info... and go to USB on the left side of System Profiler. You will get current (now power or voltage) in milliAmpere but I guess this is what you need to know. E.g.  precodeUSB Receiver:    Product ID:       0xc52b   Vendor ID:        0x046d  (Logitech Inc.)

Would be good if you could include the relevant screenshot in your answer (for later reference, if the external link goes down). <comment166401> Eventually, I've added the screenshot myself.
