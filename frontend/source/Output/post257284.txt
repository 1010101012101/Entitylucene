Audio is off completely, cannot turn on, even with "volume up" button <body> Somehow my Macbook got stuck in state where I cannot turn on the audio. I have nothing plugged into the audio jack, and in fact, have never plugged anything into the audio jack on this machine.  When I hit the "volume up" button, this image pops up for a few moments (had to rush to take a screenshot before it ghosted away again):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XfSJV.png" width="200"   Anyone seen that image/icon before and knows what might be happening?  thanks!  Here is my Macbook info:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3YuC6.png" width="500"
