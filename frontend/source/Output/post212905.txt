Web cam sharing in MacOS X <body> There is a very strange behaviour with Mac Os that i give access to web cam to multiple application like Skype and Face time .where as windows does not allow this ,any answers ??  <answer213393> your question is rather poorly worded, but i think you're asking: why does MacOS allow multiple Apps to simultaneously use/share the same camera, whereas Windows does not allow this? and how is that a problem?
