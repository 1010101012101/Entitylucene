Where are the minimize, maximise and close buttons stored in Mac OS X? <body> The question above says everything I think :D. The Icons are probably in the same folder in any version of Mac OS X I hope.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ilwIW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment159434> Actually the Icons are application specific, so if you talking about OS, in Finder for example use the Menu bar to change. Also you can use the cmd+J to open view options window. <comment159450> Well, I think I should be more specific here. What I am searching for are the folders where the default minimize, maximise and close icons are stored. If I open e.g. Finder.app there is only the icns icon and some other stuff, but not the ones I am looking for. <comment159515> A picture is worth 1000 words :) <comment159516> Yeah, sorry if I confused you :) <comment159517> I would be surprised if those were free standing Icons, I think they a part of the bar design. <comment159519> Well, they got to be somewhere, because you can replace them in your apps if you want. I hope at least, because I need the original ones pretty bad.
