Share only iTunes Match between two devices <body> My wife and I have separate Apple IDs, but all of our music is in my iTunes Match "account".  Can I share just that between our phones, keeping everything else separate?  We both have IOS 7 installed.  <answer107024> In Settings - Store, make sure you’re signed into the account that has all the music/media/etc. (iOS lets you have one Apple ID signed in for iCloud and another for store purchases).  Then, in Settings - Music, turn iTunes Match on. In iTunes for Mac, go to Store - Turn Off iTunes Match.  The iTunes Match will then only be on your iTunes devices, but your Macs won’t have any iTunes Match.
