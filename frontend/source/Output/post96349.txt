How can I get the Navionics App for iphone to utilise a third party gps <body> When I am outside of wifi and cell coverage, or even by choice, how can you use a third party GPS?  <answer96352> From the frequently asked questions page, it appears Navionics has not tested third party GPS devices:     Q. If I attach an external GPS to my iPod Touch 2nd Generation, will I locate my position on the Navionics app?      A. Navionics has not tested this thoroughly enough to guarantee a good performance.   The answer suggests third party GPS devices should just work, but may not be reliable.  <answer96782> You might want to look in to Bad Elf Pro. It connects to the iPad/iPhone using Bluetooth.
