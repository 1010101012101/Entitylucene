Is it possible to write a script to change the Energy Saver settings in OS X (10.7.3)? <body> Basically, whenever I know I'm going to be gone, or if I'm going to sleep, I change the Energy Saver settings in System Preferences in OS X (10.7.3) for Power Adapter to:  ul liComputer sleep: 1 min/li liDisplay sleep: 1 min/li /ul  If I know I'm going to be around a while, I like to change the Energy Saver settings for Power Adapter to:  ul liComputer Sleep: 15 min/li liDisplay Sleep: 15 min/li /ul  Is it possible to script this sort of change? I do it often enough that a script would be worth it.  <answer42265> Look for the section titled "Changing Power Management Settings" in this MacScripter guide. An AppleScript example from the guide:   precodedo shell script "pmset sleep 30" with administrator privileges /code/pre   <comment48046> You can also change the display sleep and store the login password in the script: `do shell script "pmset displaysleep 30" password "somepassword" with administrator privileges` <comment48048> Couldn't you just put the computer (⌥⌘⏏) or display (⌃⇧⏏) to sleep manually? <comment48226> @Lri: That also works for me. If you put that down as an answer, I'd upvote it. Is there any way to put both to sleep simultaneously? <comment48231> Normal sleep should put displays to sleep as well. (If it doesn't on your Mac, you could probably make another question about it.)
