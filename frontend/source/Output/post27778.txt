I mean if there is a huge upload and i could not be connected online for the complete duration at one go. Will iCloud support resume?  <answer67127> If you are downloading images, contacts, or other data from iCloud, it downloads items individually. If you're talking about something like a full restore from backup or backing up to iCloud, the answer is currently no.  <comment134894> What aspect of iCloud are you using to upload? Pages documents?
