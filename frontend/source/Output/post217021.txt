Pages - multiple paragraph styles in a single paragraph <body> I'm trying to write code snippets inline with prose text, much like the codeback ticks (``) in markdown/code in Pages (codeversion 5.6.1/code). I have a "code" paragraph style, and a "body" paragraph style. Is there a way to intermix the two on the same line/paragraph?  <answer217027> You need to use a emcharacter/em style for strongcode/strong, and then perhaps use a em"code block"/em paragraph style for code blocks that are, well, paragraphs. Think about this: if the code paragraph style is double spaced and your prose paragraph style is 1.5 spaced, which one "wins" when the break is mid-line?  h2To add a new Character Style in pages/h2  (from https://help.apple.com/pages/mac/5.6/index.html?localePath=en.lproj#/tan7aaef6765)     Select the character with the formatting you want to save as a style.      Click the Style button near the top of the sidebar on the right.      If you don’t see a sidebar, or the sidebar doesn’t have a Style button, click Format button in the toolbar. If the text is in a text box, table, or shape, first click the Text tab at the top of the sidebar, then click the Style button.      In the Font section, click the pop-up menu next to Character Styles, then do one of the following:      ol   liCreate a new style with a new name: Click New style button in the top-right corner of the Character Styles menu, then type a name for the style./li   liCreate a new style based on an existing style: Move the pointer over the style name in the list, click the arrow that appears, then choose Redefine from Selection (characters that used the original style aren’t changed)./li   /ol      Type a name for the style.   <comment262352> Where do you set these "character styles"? I can't find any such thing <comment262486> It was less obvious than I remembered! I edited my answer to include instructions. <comment262612> Wow, it's only 3 lines down from the Paragraph Style selection menu... Don't know how I missed that!
