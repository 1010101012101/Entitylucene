How can I name the WiFi connection distinctly from my Ethernet connection? <body> I've got a Mac Pro that is wired to my router via Ethernet. From what I understand, I cannot use Handoff and some of these modern features unless I have my WiFi connection enabled as well. Of course, I'd like the machine to prefer the wired connection because it is so much faster and I've set the priority in connections accordingly in the Network settings control panel. All is good.  Looking at my router's connection list, I've noticed that I see a "new-host" connected to my network via WiFi. What is disturbing is that it reports that it has router administration available, and thus I looked into tracing it back only to realize that it is the WiFi connection of the Mac Pro.  What I'd like to do is to name the WiFi connection to "mymac-wifi" or something along those lines to distinguish it from "mymac-eth". However, it isn't clear how to do this. I did set the 'DHCP Name' in the WiFi connection settings but that doesn't seem to fix it and changing the NetBIOS name won't hold (thus assuming it is one for the machine, not one-per-connection).  Any ideas? Unfortunately, my router doesn't offer the ability to name the MAC address of the WiFi connection :-(
