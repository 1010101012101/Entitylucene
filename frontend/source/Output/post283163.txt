cleanup bookmarks with redirects <body> I do have looots of bookmarks in my Chrome, some of them are duplicates in a sense that e.g. I stored codehttp://www.mydomain.com/code and at a later time codehttps://www.mydomain.com/code. codehttp://www.mydomain.com/code now redirects to the codehttps/code site now, so I would love to automatically cleanup all my bookmarks redirections in a sense that the new url is stored.  I found a Firefox plugin doing something similar, it updates the bookmark when visiting it, but I would love a plugin that does this automatically for all bookmarks (doesn't matter if Chrome, Safari, Firefox, ...).
