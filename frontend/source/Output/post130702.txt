How can I view locations of layers in PSD files without photoshop on osx? <body> I have some PSD files I had produced, but I don't have the positions of the layers aka images that were produced aka buttons etc.  I don't have photoshop.  I have tried gimp and pixelmator, but they don't show the coordinates of layers.  I have google how to do this for both of these packages, I can find the cursor position if I hover over the layers, but this isn't exact.  <answer130776> I have no experience with this, but I found a script that may help you.  <comment153423> Doesn't that script require Photoshop?  Jules is looking for a solution that does not require photoshop. <comment153424> It's hard to imagine that there is a solution to this that is simpler than handing it off to someone who **does** have photoshop.
