Microsoft Outlook does not properly handle redefined "Paste" keyboard shortcut <body> I've been a windows user for a long time, and I hate the kbd⌘/kbd shortcuts for stuff. Since I only use my Mac for work stuff, I figured I'd just redefine the App Shortcuts from the keyboard menu so I could use kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdC/kbd, kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdV/kbd, etc.  This works fine in almost every app I've tried, except Microsoft Outlook. There kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdC/kbd works, but kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdV/kbd does not. I can copy selected text just fine, but Paste exhibits some weird behavior.  Hitting kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdV/kbd causes the cursor to jump several lines down and scroll the e-mail. I can continue hitting kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdV/kbd until the cursor reaches the emvery/em end of the e-mail, at which point I can now paste again. The entire time, the menu shows the correct shortcut:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OF2KC.png" alt="Outlook Edit Menu"  The Edit menu does not flash (and no other menu flashes either) signaling that a keyboard shortcut in that menu has been pressed until the cursor is at the very end of the document.  And I have everything set up correctly in keyboard settings: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/92vsq.png" alt="keyboard settings"  Unsurprisingly, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdV/kbd also doesn't work because that's not a valid shortcut anymore.  Has anybody found a solution for this issue?  Edit: Turns out it's not just Outlook that has this issue. Several OSX applications will view kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdV/kbd as a "scroll down" operation.  <answer229729> Here's what worked for me:  Create DefaultKeyBinding.dict under ~/Library/KeyBindings (Create KeyBindings folder if it doesn't exists)  Then paste the contents below into that file:  precode  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;   &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;   &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;           &lt;key&gt;^v&lt;/key&gt;           &lt;string&gt;noop:&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt;   &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Alternately, you can use the following, non-XML syntax (this is the entire contents of the file, and any other keybindings would go inside the curly braces):  precode{     "^v" = noop:; } /code/pre  Restart Outlook, and all other affected programs, and ctrl + v should no longer scroll down.  <comment280361> Brilliant, wish I'd thought of that! I'm editing your answer to include the alternate way I did using DefaultKeyBinding.dict though.
