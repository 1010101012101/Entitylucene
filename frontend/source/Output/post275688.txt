VeraCrypt after Sierra upgrade: mount_osxfuse: the OSXFUSE file system is not available (255) <body> After upgrading my 2015 MBP to Sierra this past weekend, I've had a lot of issues with Samba, Veracrypt, and even VMware Fusion.   VeraCrypt will frequently give the error in the title, codemount_osxfuse: the OSXFUSE file system is not available (255)/code, when I attempt to mount a valid encrypted volume. There's nothing wrong with the volume itself, and sometimes if I reboot, I can get VeraCrypt to work properly, but it's certainly touch and go.  OSXFUSE documentation and googling hasn't suggested any fixes for this issue.  I've attempted to uninstall and reinstall OSXFUSE without any luck. Whether it works or not seems random after restarts. Obviously, restarting this often sucks. I restarted on average 3-4 times a year on Yosemite, and I've restarted about a dozen times since upgrading to Sierra dealing with these problems. I'd like to know if there's a permanent fix for this, otherwise I'll be dealing with my encrypted volumes on a Win 10 VM (when VM Fusion works, anyway...yeesh).   <answer276321> The following script from this link fixes the problem: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/315  I called this kextclean:     pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"code#!/bin/bash  function status() {     kextstat | grep org.virtualbox.kext &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ;     vbox=$((1-$?))     kextstat | grep com.github.osxfuse &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ;     fuse=$((1-$?)) }  status  if [ "$1" == "vbox" ] ; then     if [ $vbox == 1 ] ; then     echo "Already vbox"     else         sudo kextunload -b com.github.osxfuse.filesystems.osxfuse         sudo kextutil "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/VBoxDrv.kext" -r "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox"         sudo kextutil "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/VBoxNetAdp.kext" -r "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox"         sudo kextutil "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/VBoxNetFlt.kext" -r "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox"         sudo kextutil "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/VBoxUSB.kext" -r "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox"     fi elif [ "$1" == "fuse" ] ; then     if [ $fuse == 1 ] ; then     echo "Already fuse"     else         sudo kextunload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp         sudo kextunload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv         sudo kextutil /Library/Filesystems/osxfuse.fs/Contents/Extensions/10.12/osxfuse.kext     fi elif [ "$1" == "status" ] ; then     echo "vbox = $vbox"     echo "fuse = $fuse" else     echo "Run $0 &lt;vbox|fuse|status&gt;" fi /code/pre
