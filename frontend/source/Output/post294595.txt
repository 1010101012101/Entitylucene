Unicode subscript characters do not display <body> None of my apps including Chrome, TextEdit, and MacVim can display the unicode character subscript t shown here - ₜ  Example text:  precodegraph Gₓ at time Uₜ /code/pre  The subscript x displays fine but not the subscript t.  How do I fix this?  hr  MacBookPro11,2br OS 10.11.6  <answer294607> Have you checked in Character Viewer that you actually have a font installed which contains this character?  It displays for me here.  My Character Viewer says the 3rd party font Symbola is the only one I have with it.  Why more fonts don't have it I don't know.  (U+209C)
