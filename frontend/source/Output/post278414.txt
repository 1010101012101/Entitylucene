Replace a string in directory name using a variable <body> i have a script set up to make a new directoy in folder based off a variable named for another directory that goes like this:  precodestr="/home/folder/test" base="$(basename $str)"  mkdir -p "/home/folder2/${base}" /code/pre  What im trying to do now is find and replace a string in this varible when it makes the new folder.  Example, i have:  precode/Home/Album-Artist[FLAC]  /code/pre  assigned to the variable.  When i use mkdir to make the new directory, I want to find and replace "FLAC" with "V0" so in the new folder it will be  precode/Home/Album-Artist[V0] /code/pre  <answer278416> h2Solution/h2  Replace your line:  precodebase="$(basename $str)" /code/pre  with:  precodebase="$(basename $str | sed 's/FLAC/V0/')" /code/pre  or, if you want the code[/code and code]/code brackets to become part of the search pattern:  precodebase="$(basename $str | sed 's/\[FLAC\]/[V0]/')" /code/pre  h2Explanation/h2  ul liThe code|/code (or empipe/em) character essentially means “take the result and feed it into the next program”./li liThe codesed/code em(stream editor)/em command takes the input, applies commands to it, and prints the result. For example, the codes/FLAC/V0//code command in sed means “for each input line, search for codeFLAC/code and replace it with codeV0/code (but no more than once)”./li lised uses regular expressions instead of fixed search patterns. That means you need to escape certain characters; hence, my last example says code\[/code and code\]/code in the search pattern (instead of just code[/code and code]/code)./li /ul  <answer278418> In codebash/code itself you could call sed, perl, python, swift or other languages.  If you're looking to level up in bash, try:  precode${var%pattern} /code/pre  The % strips a pattern from the back of the variable so in one line you could srip out the ending and tack on the new.  precodenew=${base%\[FLAC\]}"[V0]" ## [FLAC] to [V0] with \ to escape []   /code/pre  More clear is the search and replace functionality assuming no artist or album would ever be FLAC and get matched. The tail end search above helps for that edge case, but is harder to read the intent.  precodenew=${base/FLAC/V0} /code/pre  <comment350342> brilliant, thanks a bunch
