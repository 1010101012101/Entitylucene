Open a Chrome window with a different icon <body> I can open a webpage as its own app with the following command:  precode$ open -na "Google Chrome" --args --user-data-dir="$HOME/.chrome-app-profile" --app=https://facebook.com /code/pre  Is there a way to start it with a different icon so that, when using kbdcmd/kbd + kbdtab/kbd, the new instance of Chrome running the app is distinguishable from other Chrome instances?
