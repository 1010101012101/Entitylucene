Is there a way to cancel or disable the slow dock transition easter eggs? <body> If you shift-click the minimize button or hold shift while restoring a window, you get the slow-motion genie or scale effect.  Is there a way to resume full speed after an accidental shift-click? Is there a way to disable the shift-click combination so that the transition always runs at full speed?  <answer17069> There is a way!  Open Terminal.app  Then, type this and type the following:     precodedefaults write com.apple.finder FXEnableSlowAnimation -bool false /code/pre  To make it go on again, just change the codefalse/code to codetrue/code.  strongEdit:/strong   It seems that there is no way to disable the Slow Animation special effects on shift-click.   <comment18250> Same with expos√© <comment18585> Unfortunately, this doesn't work in Snow Leopard. <comment18847> Are you sure? I am almost positive that I did this on my computer - I will check when I get home... <comment18849> Yep, [here's a question from SuperUser](http://superuser.com/questions/121472/how-to-disable-slow-motion-effect-in-mac-os-x-shift-key/121474#121474) where other users report this not working in Snow Leopard. <comment38328> I have never seen the point in this, fun to do once, but whats the point, anyone have a use?
