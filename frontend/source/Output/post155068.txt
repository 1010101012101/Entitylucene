Is it possible to use an animated image for the user picture? <body> So I dragged my .gif onto he default globe, and it shows the popup allowing me to edit the dimensions of my image. emWhile I am zooming in/out, it is still animating./em I was overjoyed at this, thinking that if the image animates in the edit panel, then it will animate on the login screen.  Nope.  Even if I re-open the image edit dialog, it emstill/em shows the animation, but it will not animate no matter what. Is there any way to get this working in the OS, or maybe a program that can do it?  <answer155070> This is currently not possible. You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttps://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul  <comment182403> Done. Hopefully it's an easy fix, and they actually care to fix it.
