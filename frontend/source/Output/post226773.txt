Printer will not print, status: "Hold for Authentication" <body> Used to be able to print like a charm. It's a network printer. Now all I get is: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVRuI.png" alt="Hold for Authentication screendump"  When checking the system log all it says is:  precode09/02/16 12:24:41,669 NetAuthSysAgent[42720]: NAHSelectionAcquireCredential Error Domain=com.apple.NetworkAuthenticationHelper Code=-1765328228 "acquire_kerberos failed username@LOCAL: -1765328228 - unable to reach any KDC in realm LOCAL, tried 0 KDCs" UserInfo={NSDescription=acquire_kerberos failed username@LOCAL: -1765328228 - unable to reach any KDC in realm LOCAL, tried 0 KDCs} /code/pre  There shouldn't be anything kerberos related with this printer.  Anyone know of a fix or workaround?  <answer226799> Have same issue with one user. Click on reload button and you will be prompted for password (it is domain password). Also removing computer and adding computer to domain and reinstalling printer helps.  <answer270024> the problem could be also related to storing a wrong password in the Key Chain Access; Go--utilities-- Keychain access  search for the printer and then update the password.    <comment275385> The printer or print server is now requiring a password. It may be that you are required to be logged into the local network or that the print server or printer has its own password.
