How to set the default flag color in OS X Lion Mail.app <body> Currently, when I use the Command+Shift+L keyboard shortcut to flag a message in Mail.app, it defaults to the first flag in the available list (Red). Instead, I would like the default to be one of the other flag options (Yellow, Purple, Grey, etc.).  Is there any way to do this?  <answer21138> Open System Preferences.  Then, open the Keyboard preference pane.  Go to the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.  In the list on the left, select Application Shortcuts.  Click on the plus sign that appears.  In the dialog box, select Mail.app in the Application drop down.  Type in "Red" without quotes as the Menu title and set something you wouldn't accidentally press as the keyboard shortcut (I chose Command+Control+Option+Shift+R). Press Add. Then, repeat the process with "Yellow" (or whatever other color you want that is available) as the Menu Title and Command+Shift+L as the Keyboard Shortcut.  Now, when you use Mail, the other color will respond to Command+Shift+L.  <comment23168> Thanks Nathan - this is exactly what I needed. One thing to note for others wanting to duplicate this... you need to quit and relaunch Mail.app after you've assigned the keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences. Once that's done, it works great. <comment93080> Unfortunately, this breaks if you have your flags "smartfolders" favorited. Because the first match in the menu will be Mailboxes, Go to favorite, Red.
