Uninstalling NTFS-3G and MacFUSE after upgrading from Yosemite to El Capitan <body> After I upgraded from Yosemite to El Capitan with NTFS-3G and MacFUSE installed, both programs stopped working. So I wanted to remove them and install Fuse for OS X instead. I still have the NTFS-3G and MacFUSE settings page in System Settings available, but I cannot uninstall them because the button is not clickable.  After some little research, I found the NTFS-3G folder under:  precode/Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-CA37AC69-836D-4620-AD96-0F566792C5A0/QuarantineRoot/System/Library/Filesystems/ntfs-3g.fs /code/pre  I tried running the script codeuninstall-package.sh/code manually, but it did not work due to the changed folder location.  Now I wanted to ask if anyone has an idea how to get rid of them, including the System Setting entries.  <answer216646> In order to remove MacFUSE, you can following this guide. So:  ol liAccess the root account: codesudo su/code/li liExecute uninstallation scripts:  precode/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/uninstall-macfuse-core.sh /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/uninstall-osxfuse-core.sh /System/Library/Filesystems/ntfs-3g.fs/Support/uninstall-package.sh /code/pre/li liAdditionally you can remove files and directories, that uninstallation scripts don't remove:  precoderm -r /Library/PreferencePanes/MacFUSE.prefPane /code/pre  (to remove the button from the preferences)  precoderm /Library/Preferences/com.google.macfuse.plist rm /Library/Logs/ntfs-3g_util.log rm /Library/Preferences/org.catacombae.macntfs-3g.DriverSettings.plist rm /Library/Preferences/org.catacombae.macntfs-3g.DriverSettings.plist.lockfile rm /private/var/run/ntfs-3g_daemon.pid rm -r /private/var/root/Library/Caches/autoinstall-macfuse-core rm -r /Users/admin/Library/Caches/com.github.osxfuse.OSXFUSEPrefPane /code/pre/li /ol  <comment261999> It seems as if this worked, thank you!
