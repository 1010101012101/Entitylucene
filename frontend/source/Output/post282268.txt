How do you delete Pixel Gun? <body> When I try to delete Pixel Gun 3D it will not work.  <answer282272> If you're using an iPhone 6s or 7, make sure you're not activating 3D Touch by pressing the app icon too firmly.  Only tap-and-hold by emgently/em resting your finger on the icon. Then you should get the option to delete.  <comment355433> *Why* doesn't it work? What error do you get? What have you tried? Why did you tag your question [lion]? Please [edit] your question with this information. <comment355439> Could you clarify the distinction between a slight vs. quick tap-and-hold? <comment355445> Lol. On my phone when I tap too quickly and hold it, it gives me options for that app, without opening the app. Now if I were to gently touch and hold it would wiggle and show the little x in the top corner. Sorry if it sounds weird, had a long day and can't think of the words to explain it better :) <comment355447> That's what I thought. I've definitely triggered 3D Touch inadvertently before. I've edited your answer to clarify the distinction. <comment355448> @Phong Much appreciated.
