Reload menu bar from terminal (not SystemUIServer) <body> I am looking for a way to reload/refresh the "apple symbol" menu in the upper left corner from the terminal.   Searching for ways to refresh the menu has only led me to find the command  precodekillall -KILL SystemUIServer /code/pre  this only reload the "widgets" on the right side of the menu and not the content on the left.   I am looking for a way to do this since I have emptied the "recent files" menu programatically (by removing the info from the codecom.apple.recentitems.plist/code file with codedefaults delete com.apple.recentitems RecentDocuments/code) but it doesn't show up. (I know that it is possible to turn off the recent files menu completly but that is not what I want).   <answer82069> So I finally found a solution to this.   I compiled the following Objective-c code and call it through the terminal.   precode#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;  int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {    @autoreleasepool {     LSSharedFileListRef recentDocsList = LSSharedFileListCreate(NULL, kLSSharedFileListRecentDocumentItems, NULL);     LSSharedFileListRemoveAllItems(recentDocsList);     NSLog(@"Cleared files!");   }    return 0; } /code/pre  <comment280424> can you share your method of compilation?  or perhaps link to a downloadable version?
