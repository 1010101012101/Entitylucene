2 usercodes on one machine <body> I have to run two usercodes on my MacBook Pro (running OSX 10.9.2), because my university insists that certain operations on the university system (the only crucial operation is printing) can only be done from the laptop if using an official university usercode.  My question is: what is the most convenient way of printing a file, when I am logged on to the non-U usercode, and the file is in the non-U userfiles. I have admin privileges: in fact I'm the only user at present.  At the moment I am going through an annoying sequence of actions  ol li Put a copy of the file in the Apple dropbox for the U usercode./li li log on as the U user/li li get the file from the dropbox in a folder where I can work on it./li li Print from the U usercode onto a University printer./li li Delete the extra copy of the file./li li Log out and log on as the non-U user./li li Repeat if something goes wrong with the printing./li /ol  Is it possible to streamline this? It would be nice if I could just issue a single su or sudo command from the non-U usercode.  <comment151907> What is a usercode? <comment151969> How about you just put the files you need to print in the shared folder space (/Users/Shared) no need to upload just copy/move it in that space and delete it when you are done. <comment152025> What, if anything, is literally preventing you from printing under the non-University user?  Printers are system-wide resources, so if you have a printer installed in OS X under one user, it should be available under other users unless your computer has had some configuration work done. <comment152134> @thankyour: I haven't tried to print from the non-University code, but i assume the system will check whether the usercode has the relevant permissions before agreeing to print. <comment152260> @DavidEpstein You know what assuming does. ;)  Try printing and see what happens!  Unless you fear for your job.  If they fire you over printing something, find a new job?
