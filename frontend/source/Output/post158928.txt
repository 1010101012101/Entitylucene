On the iPhone lock screen, how can I see just the number of unread mails? <body> As a Windows Phone user, I can see the emnumber/em of new mails for an account on my lock screen.   I'd like to have the same effect on my iPhone, strongwithout/strong seeing the mail's preview content. Is there a way to do this without jailbreaking the phone? Note that I realize I can have mails in my notifications area, but that involves seeing a mail preview.   <answer158929> Settings, Notifications, Mail.  Change "Show Previews" (all the way at the bottom) to off.  <answer158930> Unfortunately, this isn’t possible with the stock email client on iOS.  <comment186816> This is possible.  Simply disable "show preview" in Settings, Notifications, Mail. <comment186818> The question was about the *number* of unread email. It’s definitely not possible to have the iOS stock email client show this on the lock screen. <comment186826> @PatrickMcMahon Plus, disabling “Show Previews” won’t hide the sender’s name (it will still read _John Doe 2m ago – Mail message – slide to read_) <comment186829> I know, however it's as close as @Craig will be able to get without jailbreaking.
