Possible to transfer WhatsApp history from Android to iOS? <body> I have an Android phone with WhatsApp installed on it. I want to move this Sim-Card to an iPhone and installing WhatsApp on it.  strongIs it possible to backup/transfer/restore the history over to iOS?/strong   I saw that there are third party apps. So it seems it should work.   <answer168343> From the WhatsApp FAQ it looks like it is unfortunately not possible.   Also there is info on the website saying:     Your WhatsApp messages are automatically backed up and saved on your phone's memory daily.   So that must mean that it is saved in the application sandbox on iOS - therefore there would have to be an in-app mechanism to import the data, which seems to be lacking as the only feature close to this matter is emArchive All Conversations/em - one way only.  <comment285008> Are the any news on this? There are paid and dubious applications on the internet which claim they can make that happen. Are there any open source / scripts available which do this transformation?
