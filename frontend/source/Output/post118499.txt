Why does my 2nd gen iPod Touch have silent songs? <body> I've set my iPod Touch to sync songs but downsample them to 192 kbps to save space since it's an 8 GB model.  Some of the songs when I play them are silent (though the right length of silence). If I resync the device, the ones that are silent change.  Like, song A will be silent. I do a sync, and now song A is fine. But song B is silent.  Any clue what's going on?  I'm syncing this using iTunes version 11.1.3 64-bit.  <comment138272> What happens when you don't degrade them to 192kbps? <comment138302> Will have to try. My normal syncing to my iPod Classic (latest version) works fine.
