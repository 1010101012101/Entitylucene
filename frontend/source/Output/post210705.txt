Spotlight search results priority <body> I noticed recently (could be caused by upgrade to 10.10.4) that Spotlight is changing order of the search results dynamically as you type and OS X installed apps have no more the highest priority (I am almost sure this was the case before).  For example searching for the Caffeine app:  ol liOpen Spotlight /li liType strong"caf"/strong/li /ol  The top hit starts off with the app I'm looking for (yay!)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yhg5c.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liPress strong"f"/strong so the search term is now strong"caff"/strong/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wi3dl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Wikipedia entry is now the first result and hitting enter opens the Safari.app instead of the Caffeine.app :(  I mostly used Spotlight for quick app opening, which is now much slower because I always have to double-check that I am actually opening the app instead of Safari.  Is it somehow possible to disable this behavior or prioritize installed apps over Internet search results?  <answer210710> strongEDIT:/strongbr I have noticed that as I use Spotlight, it begins to 'learn' your search preferences.  For example, search codecaf/code then select Caffiene.  After a few times it should become the dominant result.  hr  You can turn on or off what Spotlight returns in System Preferences.  Go to ï£¿  strongSystem Preferences/strong  ul liSelect strongSpotlight/strong/li liIn the strongSearch Results/strong tab, deselect items you don't wish to see in results./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIKrr.png" alt="Spotlight Preferences"  <answer221632> System Preferences lets you choose what is displayed, but (since 10.9?) it no longer lets you select the order/priority of results. It would be nice to have that functionality back. I find that I'm constantly opening/launching something I didn't mean to because of the dynamic ordering of results in 10.11.  <answer224762> While we can't reorganize these easily you can at least filter the search. You can use any of these filters:       kind:applicationbr   kind:applicationsbr   kind:appbr   kind:contactbr   kind:contactsbr   kind:folderbr   kind:foldersbr   kind:imagebr   kind:imagesbr   kind:moviebr   kind:moviesbr   kind:musicbr   kind:audiobr   kind:jpegbr   kind:pictbr   kind:textbr   kind:rtfbr   kind:osxdailybr   kind:pdfbr   kind:pdfsbr   kind:system preferencesbr   kind:preferencesbr   kind:bookmarkbr   kind:bookmarksbr   kind:fontbr   kind:fontsbr   kind:presentationsbr   kind:presentationbr   kind:emailbr   kind:emailsbr   kind:mail message   kind:mail messagesbr   kind:eventbr   kind:eventsbr   kind:reminderbr   kind:reminders     And even        kind:applicationbr   kind:pdfbr   kind:jpegbr   kind:wordbr   kind:folderbr   kind:imagebr   kind:audiobr   date:todaybr   date:yesterdaybr   date:1/1/2016     <answer282546> Try adding a Tag to the item to see if that helps.  ol lifocus on the item and codecmd+I/code to Get Info./li liIn the "Add Tags" field, add something like codecaff/code./li /ol  In my experience, the Tags seem to bump up the item in Spotlight.
