To Rescue Nonbooting OS X with Grub? <body> I had Refind bootloader in Macbook Air 2013-mid. My disk has OSX and broken Ubuntu. Ubuntu messed up my bootloader such that it starts only.  I cannot go to grub/refind by pressing ALT, ALT-R, ... My SIP is disabled.   I followed the guides here and here. I am now in codegrub&gt;/code command prompt where I managed to get by pressing codeESC/code at startup. In codegrub/code, codels/code gives  precode(proc) (hd0) (hd1) (hd3) (hd1,gpt4) (hd1,gpt2) (hd1,gpt1) error: failure reading sector 0x0 from `hd2' /code/pre  where   ul licodehd1/code is my SSD find out by codels (hd1)/code/li licode(hd1,gpt1)/code EFI here, fat filesystem, probably swap size 20kB/li licode(hd1,gpt2)/code 75 GB here, probably OS X/li licode(hd1,gpt3)/code Recovery HD, not sure what/li licode(hd1,gpt4)/code Ubuntu 16.04, 45 Gb here/li /ul  So I need to setup a bootloader which has code(hd1,gpt2)/code and code(hd1,gpt4)/code in the same table. I may still have coderefind/code but not sure, because Ubuntu probably replaced it.  strongProblem/strong: codels (hd1,gpt2)//code gives  precodeerror: unknown filesystem /code/pre  I cannot configure the bootloader apparently back with Linux grub.  If I could see the contents, I would like to do   precodeset root='(hd1,gpt2)' ... /code/pre  I really would like to start some stronglive system/strong to fix the thing, but I cannot find any key to boot from USB.   h2Updates in Linux side/h2  I did many update and upgrade cycles on the Linux side. So the Linux kernel is now 4.4. In startup, I get only Grub menu where is no OS X. Just the Ubuntu and its variations.  So I think the strongproblem is just to link the OS X to Grub/strong but I am not sure about if when I could read OS X filesystem in codegrub&gt;/code.   h2Unsuccessful attempt of installing refind in Linux/h2  In Linux, install coderefind/code again  precodesudo apt-add-repository ppa:rodsmith/refind sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install refind /code/pre  and answer codeyes/code. Restart. However, Grub is still there but not refind.   hr  How can you fix the bootloader in Macbook?  <answer240321> Just run the coderefind-install/code script with codesudo/code in the OS X side. I could not get to the recovery mode. This solved the problem.   <comment295754> Your question referred to a boot loader. Grub, for example, is a boot loader. Refind is not. Refind is boot manager. <comment295755> I added it to a tag. Anything that solves the thing is ok for me here.
