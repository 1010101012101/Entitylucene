Create web presentation with speaker notes <body> I'd like to export my Keynote 6.1 presentation as a web page. I'd like viewers to be able to step through the presentation while being able to read the notes alongside. The presentation has some animations which are essential to the topic, so the PDF export won't be suitable.  Is there a way to do this? I don't see a lot of options on the Keynote web exporter and the speaker notes don't seem to make it into the HTML directory.
