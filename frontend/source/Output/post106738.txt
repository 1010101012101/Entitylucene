Download files and keep archive <body> Is there a way to keep the archive of a downloaded file/folder? Currently, the archive is moved directly to the Trash can as soon as the content is expanded.  Thanks  Update: screenshot following MK's instructions:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kxvBf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer106743> You have to change the preferences for codeArchive Utility/code, which is the default unarchiver used by the browser.  ul liOpen Finder and go to code/System/Library/CoreServices//code (from the strongGo  Go to Folder.../strong menu option or pressing kbdShift/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdG/kbd)/li liOpen codeArchive Utility.app/code from that location/li liGo to strongArchive Utility  Preferences/strong (or press kbdCmd/kbd+kbd,/kbd)/li liIn the strongAfter expanding:/strong dropdown, choose strongleave archive alone/strong (you would currently have this set to "move archive to Trash")/li liQuit codeArchive Utility.app/code/li /ul  <comment125271> Very cool - thanks M K. I followed your instructions and got to Archive Utility  Preferences. I've edited my question to show the prefs window. The preferences were already set to "leave archive alone". That doesn't seem to do the job. This is 10.9 so it may be a bug. It may be that I need to delete the prefs and reset them. I will post again. Meanwhile, +1 for a great answer..
