Using earpods from iphone5 with iphone 3g <body> I'm about to buy earpods, but since i have iphone 3g, and i didnt find any info on its compatibility, would like to know if they will work with old iphone? AFAIK every 3.5inch headphones will work  <answer82610> Yes, they work as expected. I'm using them at the moment with an older phone.  <answer82612> According to Apple's Earpod product page, they aren't compatible with the iPhone 3G at first glance because they aren't listed in the compatible products section.  strongHowever,/strong under "Compatibility Information" you should be set:     The remote and mic are supported by all models of iPod, iPhone, and iPad (not all models support volume up/down functions). Audio is supported by all iPod models.   So, while not exactly under compatible products, they should work on your iPhone.
