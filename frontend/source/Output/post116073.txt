Why is OS X Maverics upgrade size the same as a fresh install? <body> I have OSX 10.7 that came installed on my MacBook by default, and decided to upgrade to 10.9 Mavericks.  The download is ~5GB in size, if I have a network disconnect I am worried it will begin form the start. Is there a way I cam download the upgrade of smaller size or do I have to get new installation in any case, and then how should I have a resumable download?  <answer116074> Mac App Store downloads support pausing and continuing after connectivity problems. You can safely download Mavericks without fear of having to restart the download in the case of any disconnections.  <answer116076> supYou seem to have two questions here…/sup     Why is OS X Mavericks upgrade size the same as a fresh install?   There's only one installer. Unlike Windows, there's a single OS X installer that is able to install on and/or upgrade any machine capable of running Mavericks, from any prior version of OS X all the way back to 10.6.     Is there a way I can download the upgrade of smaller size or do I have to get new installation in any case, and then how should I have a resumable download?   No, the OS X Mavericks install is the single installer available — there's no smaller copy.  The Mac App Store emdoes/em support resumable download, so don't worry about your internet connection dropping. It will pause/resume the download automatically.  <comment135839> what is the location where the dmg file is getting downloaded ? <comment135840> @san The DMG is inside the app package. <comment135841> at the moment , the download is in progress, and I do not see the app package in `/Appliations` which is what I asked where is the in progress file being downloaded ? <comment135855> @san `/var/folders/*/*/C/com.apple.appstore/`.
