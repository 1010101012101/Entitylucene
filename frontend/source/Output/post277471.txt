LibreOffice Tab Bar is positioned on top of the Toolbar <body> I installed LibreOffice version 5.2.6.2 on my Mac.  Unfortunately, whenever I open a second document (or attempt to view the Properties of an open document) a Tab Bar appears, showing open documents.  This would be good, except the Tab Bar is positioned on top of the Toolbar, making it impossible to use.  I have noticed similar problems (overlapping dialogs) in other applications since upgrading to the last couple of versions of macOS.  Is there a app specific (or general) fix?  <comment349234> What version of macOS are you running? <comment349235> Sierra 10.12.1 xxx
