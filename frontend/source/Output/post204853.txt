Can't login until I do 'mount -uw /' in single user mode (MPB, Yosemite) <body> When I start my MBP with Yosemite it runs a bit slow, then I see login screen  only with the 'Others...' user and two inputs fields: login and password. When I try to enter my user login/password it doesn't fit, so I can't login.  But when I run single user mode first, type codemount -uw //code, then type codeexit/code to continue loading, the login screen works fine, shows me my users and is letting me in.  It seems to me, that the problem is affiliated with an unmounted filesystem, but how could I check it and fix it?  hr  ps: Friendly advice: it appears to me that I made it myself unintentionally, when I tried to fix Yosemite wi-fi and overwrote lots of files in /Library/Preferences/. Without backups, brr. Don't do this if you don't understand what exactly you are doing or at least make backups.  <comment246980> Welcome to Ask Different!
