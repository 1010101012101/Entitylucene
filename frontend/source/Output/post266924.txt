How set predefined icons for some files <body> When I boot up my mac, for a second the files have the icons of the app I use to open them, for example a file .doc has an icon with the "W" of Microsoft Word, an .mp3 has the icon of VLC etc..  For example this is the icon of a .doc file it "flashes" for 1-2 seconds  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yAM2S.jpg" alt="Icon it flashes for a second"  After a second the icons change and become the ones predefined by the system (the ones the files would have if there was not a third-part app to open the file), basically a white icon with .doc written in it.  How can I make the files with some extension keep the icon made by the app I use to open them?
