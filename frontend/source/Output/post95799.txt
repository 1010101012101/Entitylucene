Yet another headphone stuck in retina macbook pro question <body> as the title states, my headphone jack is useless because a headphone cable broke off in the jack. I can't get audio through the speakers because the computer thinks there're headphones plugged in. I had read and thought that I couldn't redirect audio because it was a hardware issue. But, when I installed Windows 7 through bootcamp, I was getting audio through the speakers. So, I know now that it isn't a hardware issue, but a software issue in OSX.  If one were to solve this via software (hack, script, etc) how do you think one would go about doing this?  Last time I took in my computer to the Apple store to try and get the bit of cable out of the jack, they couldn't and recommended that I use an adhesive.  Thanks for your help  Latest version retina macbook pro 15" (mid or late 2012) running OSX 10.8.4  <answer95804> Do not know about software but assume you would like to use your Headphone eventualy.  Removing broken Headset pin     The gentle methods:   Use instant glue at the end of Q-tip shaft.  The disadvantage, depending how deep you have to go in glue can stick and cover the contacts in the socket so it wont work afterward.     The "Man" methods:   Use Drill bits (broken screw) removal tools, or something like it. Yes you will be drilling :)  The disadvantage: You are Drilling !     The profession methods:   Disassemble you computer and access the headphone jack from insidethis is the best method.  The disadvantage: Know-how + Time + Cost! ?  <comment112465> Thanks. Was hoping for a software fix, but can't help it if one doesn't exist.  I'll be taking it to a different apple store hopefully with better results.  Thanks again.
