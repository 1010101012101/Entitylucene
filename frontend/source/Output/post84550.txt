Huge time machine backup on NAS needs to be compacted <body> I am backing up to a QNAP NAS latest firmware using their Time Machine functionality which works great. I run VMware Fusion and learned that it isn't a good idea to backup the VM's. My TM backup for this computer alone is 500GB even though I have a 256GB drive and am only using 120GB. I am not backing up any external drives either. I know it is possible to compact .sparseimages, but how would I do this on a the NAS? Unfortunately they don't provide an interface for that. The drive is mounted when TM runs it's backup, but I don't have access to it unless TM is running and its probably not a good idea to compact while TM is running. I can SSH into the server.
