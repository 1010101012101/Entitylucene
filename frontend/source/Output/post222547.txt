Alias use from Terminal - What's the magic recipe? <body> I wanted to make a shortcut at my root, entry Terminal directory  strongGoal/strong  an Alias for code/someLongPath/someProject//code at code~/someProject/code  strongProblem/strong  I create the Alias and locate it at code~//code. For me this is code~/MultiTimer/code here. But for the Alias, the Terminal use of codecd/code does not work!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ctdWs.png" alt="terminal screenshot"  strongQuestion/strong  How do you use codecd/code from the Terminal for an Alias? Can this be setup?  <answer222554> the answer is simple - use 'ln -s' and not an Alias!  <answer222561> Aliases are special files for OS X and currently only supported by GUI apps. They contain information about the target object wich allows the finder to find the original location even if the target has been moved across filesystems.   There is some C source to build a tool that gets the target name out of an alias file (Link to source code), but I think to use it in the way you would like (codecd/code) this is not that practical. Ex:  precodecd `./getTrueName Multitimer` /code/pre  As mentioned in the first answer, codeln/code is the right tool to use if you don't need the advanced Alias features:  codeln -s &lt;sourcepath&gt; &lt;targetpath&gt;/code does not allow for target movement.  codeln &lt;sourcepath&gt; &lt;targetpath&gt;/code allows for target movement, but only on the same file system.  <comment269711> Please do not update your question to include the answer directly, post an answer below instead. Including answers directly in questions confuses both the search function and other users (and makes it kind of hard to upvote/accept an answer). <comment269713> good call - yikes I'm on it ;0! <comment269715> Closely related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/180762/how-to-go-to-alias-from-terminal?rq=1 <comment269727> your detail and clarity is quite valuable for newbs like me... thanks!!! :)
