unable to boot past progress indicator (apple with loading bar) <body> The iMac I am currently trouble shooting will not boot past the progress bar screen. The progress bar will load 50% then will not load anymore. My two issues are fully booting the imac and also getting past the password to possibly re-image the imac. I work for a library and someone either forgot the password or a patron put it on the pc.  I have tried rebooting in safe mode..if I do this I am prompted to enter a password under a lock. I have tried booting in target disk mode, nothing happens and the mac boots as if it doesn't recognize the command. Resetting NVRAM does not work either, the lock and prompt for a password appears again.   At this point the imac might be written off as a loss since it cannot be used..   <comment313105> Somebody has set the Open Firmware password. Try the steps mentioned in [this article](http://osxdaily.com/2015/01/28/forgot-mac-firmware-password-what-now/). The easiest thing to try if the iMac has the RAM slots either on the lower edge (older iMacs) or available from a hatch on the back (newer iMacs) is to remove one RAM card (if there are two) and reboot. If there is only one RAM card, install another card of the same specifications, but with a different capacity.
