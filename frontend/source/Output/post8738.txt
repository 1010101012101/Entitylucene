What is this symbol? ⎋ (it is listed as menu shortcut) <body> The shortcut that is reported in the -menu, for emForce Quit/em menu-item, is kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd⎋/kbd (the last character is the Unicode embroken circle with northwest arrow/em). What key should I press to invoke the emForce Quit/em menu-item?   <answer8745> To be concise: the symbol you're asking about, the circle with the arrow escaping from it (that's the way I remember what it means), is the Apple way of saying 'The ESC Key'.  So the menu item ⌥⌘⎋  is kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdesc/kbd pressed simultaneously.  <answer8750> As an extension to Ian's answer, here's a list of all the keys:  Apple Special Key Symbols  As correctly pointed out by Ian, the ⎋ is the Escape key located on the upper left side of your keyboard.   <answer21805> The Escape key.   I don't know why Apple use this non-standard symbol, but they always have...  Here is a full list of all of the symbols that Apple use.  <answer38539> You can find a list of all the keyboard icons, terminology, and HTML entities over here on Meta .

[(wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esc_key) Sounds pretty standard to me. <comment24132> I've never seen that symbol in use on a non-Mac system, but maybe I haven't been paying attention... <comment24236> My current MBP (early 2011) uses no symbol and reads "esc" on the Escape Key. If it was a standards, I guess Apple is abandoning it now for a wider the-facto standard. <comment24916> It's a reasonably logical symbol for Escape, but for some reason I always think it means the power button. :-) <comment36114> Perhaps they use "esc" on English-language keyboards, but a symbol on others.  At least they do that for "return" and "shift". <comment256797> Most people know where the esc key is. <comment256813> @whoKnows I'd rather give more info than not enough
