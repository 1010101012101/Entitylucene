HP Product Research on Activity Log <body> I'm seeing an item on my activity monitor called 'HP Product Research.'   I assume it's associated with some HP Printer drivers that I no long need, and have have removed, but this tracker keeps hanging around.  Any ideas on how to get rid of this tracker?  <answer116333> There's an official way to remove it: Run HP Customer Participation.app from the HP application folder. There's a checkbox to 'opt out' of product research.  <answer242589> Yo may find this app here:  precode/Library/Printers/hp/Utilities/HPPU Plugins/ProductImprovementStudy.hptask/Contents/Helpers/HP Customer Participation.app /code/pre  Just move it to the trash.  <answer260779> Macintosh HD  Library | Application Support | Hewlett-Packard | Customer Participation   HP Product Research.app and other files are in that folder.  <comment117593> Can't you `Inspect` in Activity Monitor, then `Open Files and Ports`, and delete the files mentioned there? <comment117600> Try System Preferences  Users & Groups  (your user)  Login Items tab. Click the lock in the lower-left to authenticate, then click the HP item in the list and click the - (minus) button to remove it. <comment117638> A combination of the two seemed to work. I think there are some remnant files somewhere, but the app is at least not functioning now. <comment136263> Tried that. It does not work. <comment278307> Yes, this does not work as HP Customer Participation.app is not visible
