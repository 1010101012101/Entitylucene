Yosemite 10.10.3 asks for google password every week with 2 factor authentication <body> I have two factor authentication enabled on my google account and I was really happy when Apple finally started to support that.  However there is a slight nuisance: OSX keeps asking for a password every week or so and I have to reenter the security code for two factor authentication.  The "Never ask on this device" option is nowhere to be found. What is going on?   <answer191956> As far as I know, Google still considers some apps (including Apple's) to be less secure, as they call them. As a solution to be safe, they can force you to reauthenticate from time to time.  My solution, that I'm happy with so far, is to use their App Passwords for every single app that is emless secure/em and does this annoying reauthentication step.  <answer193777> I've been searching for a solution to this for a long time and haven't found something suitable. As noted by @michal, Google was requiring App Passwords for different apps in OSX but as of 10.10.3, that requirement has been removed.  emNote: If you have iOS 8.3 on your iPhone or OSX 10.10.3 on your Mac, you will no longer have to use App passwords to use 2-Step Verification./em1
