Large mysterious downloads in iOS <body> I'm running iOS 9.2 on an iPad Air 2. I was connected to a wifi hotspot that is generated by my Android phone (a Nexus 5), which is something I do regularly without any issues. On my phone I track my daily data usage using the MyDataManager app, and until a certain point today I had used about 80 MB. But shortly after I saw this 80 MB number I got a notification that I had exceeded my daily data quota, having used about 1.5 GB! The data usage had suddenly shot up, and the app indicated that the data was consumed almost exclusively by wifi tethering. I didn't think to shut off my data and soon after (maybe 15 min later?) the usage had shot up to about 2.5 GB before the Android system itself shut off data since I had exceeded my monthly quota. What could have caused iOS to suddenly download all this data? I signed up for Apple Music yesterday on my iPad, could that have something to do with it?  <comment265806> Automatic app updates? <comment265808> It might be Wi-Fi assist? Can you check your Settings - Cellular and you tell us what might be hogging the data (or attack a screen shot)? <comment265988> I don't have the Cellular tab in Settings, it's the wifi-only iPad. I suppose it could be automatic updates, although over 2 GB of updates seems like a lot. So I disabled automatic downloads of Updates (along with automatic Music, Apps, and Books downloads) in the iTunes & App Store Settings tab. Maybe it'll be OK from now on?
