Changed the mod for ~/.. directory by mistake, made it 744, can't boot anymore <body> I ran the following command by mistake:  precodesudo chmod 744 ~/.. /code/pre  and I can't boot my macbook anymore, it freezes with the brown screen and ajax-style spin. What should I do to make it work normally again?  I tried:  a) Disk utility (repair permissions) - didn't help b) resetpassword - reset ACL and permissions for home directory - didn't help.  I booted in the recovery mode, opened the terminal and went to "/Volumes/Macintosh HD". Yes, this was the disk (or should I say "path") I changed the permissions for.   How do I restore them now? And what are they were?  strongUPDATE:/strong  I was able to restore it by going to the terminal in recovery mode and performing:  precodechmod 777 "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/" /code/pre  But I believe that code777/code is too much. What's the default umask for code~/../code ?  strongUPDATE2:/strong  I don't know why it worked since code~/../code means code/Users/code, not code//code.  <answer134829> I would do two things to restore a Mac in this situation.  ol liboot to recovery mode and run Disk Utility - repair the drive, the volume and then repair permissions./li liBoot to recovery mode and run the installer. That should fix or log the exact directory that has improper ACL/permissions and re-create all basic mount points./li /ol  The installer log can be read in recovery mode boot if step 2 doesn't fix things and we can perhaps refine exactly what directory or directories are now messed up. There is a chance that you had a separate failure and your codechmod/code was coincidental to the issue as opposed to causative.   <comment159717> It's on my machine: `drwxr-xr-x    8 root       admin         272 27 lut 14:53 ..` <comment159718> @MateuszSzlosek, and what's the umask for that? <comment159719> @MateuszSzlosek Really? No ACLs? <comment159721> that's my output from `ls -la` inside $HOME how to check umask ? <comment159722> @MateuszSzlosek, it can be calculated from "drwxr-xr-x", let me check. <comment159773> @njboot, positive? not 755?
