Sorry for the inconvenience. <comment57240> This takes 3 clicks… seems faster than typing out a terminal command, or downloading some app to each computer <comment57241> Good point. However, Apple Remote Desktop client (ARD) is already on the machines by default and this would be 3 clicks per machine. If I wasn't to use ARD and I just had 2 or 3 machines this may indeed be one of the faster approaches. <comment57242> Thanks, this is a very quick solution. However, in this case I need to accomplish this remotely on multiple machines. I am looking for a solution that is a little less hands on. <comment57253> @E1Suave I know. This is the fastest way I know of to get the address.
