Opening text files from finder: Unable to find application <body> Since I updated my OSX to version 10.9.1 I am unable to open text files from the Finder.  I always opened the files with the default TextEditor. I've tried to change the default application from TextEditor to Sublime Text 2, which results in exactly the same error:  "Unable to find the application"  When I open TextEditor or Sublime Text 2 I can successfully open the file and view it's contents.   Is there a way to fix this problem?  <answer114455> Try setting the default app to open .txt files using Get Info  ol liLeft click a text file/li liChoose "Get Info"/li liUnder "Open with:" choose the app you want to use as the default/li liClick "Change All..."/li liClick "Continue"/li /ol  <comment134090> You could try resetting the Launch Services database by running `$(locate lsregister) -kill -domain local -domain system -domain user`. <comment134393> I tried this without success the first time. After a reboot I tried the suggested solution again, now it works. Weird stuff :)
