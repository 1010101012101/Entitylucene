AppleScript input text from user <body> precodetell application "Reminders"     set newReminder to make new reminder     set name of newReminder to "Text"     set due date of newReminder to current date end tell /code/pre  How can I set the name of newReminder to input text?  <answer251347> Here's an AppleScript emcode/em example:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeset newReminderName to "" repeat until newReminderName is not ""     set newReminderName to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a name for the reminder:" buttons {"Cancel", "OK"} default button 2 default answer "" with icon 1)     if newReminderName is not "" then         tell application "Reminders"             set newReminder to make new reminder             set name of newReminder to newReminderName             set due date of newReminder to current date         end tell     end if end repeat /code/pre  This is coded so that you either have to enter a name for the reminder or cancel the prompt. In other words, if you don't type a name and click OK, you're prompted again and again until you do, or click Cancel.  hr  Updated to address a point mentioned in comment:  The emcode/em below is used in an Automator service where the selected text passed to the Automator service becomes the name of the new reminder. It is coded not to create the reminder if an empty sting is passed. Although I don't think it can be triggered unless some text is selected, nonetheless it's always best to include some form of error checking.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeon run {input}     set newReminderName to input     if newReminderName is not "" then         tell application "Reminders"             set newReminder to make new reminder             set name of newReminder to newReminderName             set due date of newReminder to current date         end tell     end if end run /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mI9V7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment312390> this is excellent and I love it. If possible without the dialog, and to have my selected text as its name automatically, thank you. <comment312402> I've updated my answer to address your comment. <comment312423> This is exactly what i had in mind, thank you so much, made my day.
