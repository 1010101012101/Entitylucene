Focus floating system windows with keyboard <body> The windows I'm talking about are the system administrator password request popups, the wireless network web sign-in popup, and other system request dialogs, such as "Application was downloaded from the Internet" confirmations. Often when these popups appear for me there is no focus on the input/buttons. I need to remove my hands from the keyboard and mouse over to them.  These popups do not appear in the application switcher, and seem to be immune to these focus-grabbing keyboard shortcuts:  ul likbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbd`/kbd/li likbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd/li likbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdF1/kbd through kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdF12/kbd/li /ul  I have seen one solution that involved turning on OS X's VoiceOver utility with kbd⌃/kbd+kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbdF2/kbd,kbdF2/kbd. I'd prefer not to have this turned on, since in my regular work hours I use kbd⌃/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+F-keys in my IDE.  I would post pictures, but my reputation isn't high enough yet.  UPDATE: I do, in fact, already have the option set in System Preferences to allow keyboard  navigation in all control windows.  <answer63905> If you enable full keyboard access in System Preferences, you can press tab to select the buttons.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zto66.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ynhY.png" alt=""  I don't know how to focus the windows though. They can't be selected with ⌃F4 or ^F6. I was going to suggest Witch, but it doesn't show them either.  This is a bit of a hack, but you could assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat with p in {"SecurityAgent", "CoreServicesUIAgent", "loginwindow"}         if exists process p then             tell process p                 if windows is not {} then                     set frontmost to true                     exit repeat                 end if             end tell         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Password dialogs are shown by SecurityAgent, Gatekeeper and quarantine dialogs by CoreServicesUIAgent, and the force quit window by loginwindow.  <comment73912> I do, in fact, have this option already checked. The issue occurs if I happen to be switching applications as the popup appears, causing it to lose focus but remain on top of all other windows. <comment76232> VoiceOver doesn't have to be Control-Option-F2; it's Command-F5 by default. <comment77019> Tried your AppleScript as an extension to Alfred (a launcher that can assign global hotkeys). It still refuses to focus `networksetup is trying to modify your system configuration` dialogs :( <comment77031> It works for me at least after running `networksetup -setcomputername a` in Terminal.
