Verify Account Apple ID email address cannot be verified change email address <body> Verify your account message came up saying this apple IDs email address cannot be verified.   Change your apple IDs email address at applieid.apple.com to sign into iCloud.  I've been trying to figure out how to do this for the past 2 hours.  <answer248794> Create new apple id account ok  <comment308413> Bad idea. Everything already purchased, including the iOS itself & the phone's Activation Lock, belongs to the original ID. <comment308414> [Contact Apple](https://support.apple.com/contact?cid=acs::applesearch)
