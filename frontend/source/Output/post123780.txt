MacPort : Is a given package a dependecy for another one ? <body> My MacPort package are becoming the huge mess. I probably won't use some of them and I was wondering how I could know if a given package is a dependecy for another one.   For example I have GTK3 installed. How could I know which other installed package needs GTK3.   <answer123798> From Macports guide You can list all the ports dependent on a port x say  precodeport echo depends:x /code/pre  To find ports that have no dependants use   precodeport echo leaves /code/pre  <comment144641> You could even pipe the leaves into the depends:x to get all the ports who are leaves and are not depended on <comment144642> @RossMcKinley leaves are ports that are not depend on so that will just goer the leaves <comment144644> Oh right, my mistake. I didn't read those properly. <comment145101> For your particular use case of finding the package that pulled in gtk3: `port installed rdependentof:gtk3 and requested`. This prints the ports you manually installed (`requested`) and are in the recursive tree of dependents, i.e. that somehow indirectly or directly depend on gtk3.
