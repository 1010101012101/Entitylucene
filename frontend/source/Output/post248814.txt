How to clean up Docker for Mac containers <body> I'm using Docker for Mac Version 1.12.0-beta21 (build: 11019) on OS X 10.11.6. The container folder in code$HOME/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/code contains 3.1 GB of space. codedocker images -a/code however only shows one image which is 330 MB.  How can I clean up the container folder, so that it only contains the images I'm able to use?  h1Update/h1  There is an open issue regarding this problem: https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/371  <answer249000> Spotify have a useful docker image called docker-gc which will clean up unused images.  As per the Github page for it, you can run it as a container itself:  codedocker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /etc:/etc spotify/docker-gc /code  I have that aliased to codedocker-gc/code which I run periodically to clean things up.  <answer273096> Check the size with this command below:  precodedu -h -d 1  ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker  /code/pre  Restart the default settings on top bar to clean.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uxKXp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Or create a script like this link to don't lose the images.  https://blog.mrtrustor.net/post/clean-docker-for-mac/  <comment309542> I'm on OS X and not on linux. <comment309575> @ohcibi As am I. <comment332012> Okay I misunderstood you before. However I tried that and it even deleted some images and containers but the space ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker consumes is the same. <comment332013> Okay I found that: https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/371
