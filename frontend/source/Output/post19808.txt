What are the .mbox files in ~/Library/Mail/Mail Lost+Found/Mailboxes in Mail.app 5.0 (Lion)? <body> When I upgraded to Lion, Mail.app 5.0 created a directory code~/Library/Mail/Mail Lost+Found/code. There were a couple of outdated bundles, which seems logical. But there is also a codeMailboxes/code directory that has a lot (~30-40) .mbox files. Here is the contents of one of those files:  precodetotal used in directory 224 available 282057236 drwxr-xr-x   6 kmm  kmm     204 Aug  1 15:55 . drwxr-xr-x  17 kmm  kmm     578 Aug  2 08:47 .. -rw-rw-r--   1 kmm  kmm       0 Nov  6  2007 .index.ready -rw-rw-r--   1 kmm  kmm  109793 Nov  6  2007 Incoming_Mail -rw-rw-r--   1 kmm  kmm    1860 Nov  6  2007 Incoming_Table_of_Contents -rw-rw-r--   1 kmm  kmm       0 Nov  6  2007 mbox.SKindex.isValid /code/pre  Is it safe to delete these files? I haven't opened them all to determine if any contains actual messages. The few I have opened have not.  They only occupy 9.5 mb in total, which isn't much, admittedly. But I have something against cruft hanging around when it's not needed.  <answer19849> The lost+found folder is a special UNIX folder created for a variety of reasons: Most often the lost+found folder is created after a forced shutdown or a power cut. The OS loses track of what was going on and instead of dumping any files or folders it has lost track of, it puts them in the lost+found folder.   It's not much to be concerned about , seeing as those are some old files they can probably be safely deleted.  <answer27831> This folder is created by Mail when updating to Lion. I don't think it indicates any problems with a forced shutdown. It's just a place to store the old files after Mail has migrated to its new folder structure in the ~/Library/Mail/V2 folder. If the update is successful, you shouldn't need anything in this folder, except perhaps the contents of the Bundles folder if you want to re-install any plug-ins.  <comment21850> It is possible that these files have existed for a long time. I hadn't looked in ~/Mail recently -- not until I upgraded. <comment32013> This is not that folder! Repairing a HFS filesystem doesn't generate a `lost+found`, and the name indicates that this one was probably created by Mail. It is probably *named after* the traditional `lost+found` and serves a similar role of collecting misplaced files, but I highly doubt it actually stores files *lost due to filesystem corruption*.
