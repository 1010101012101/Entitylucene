Could not initialize an installer - Mac <body> I have been trying to install BitTorrent and µTorrent on my Macbook, and it's been 3 days I am unable to install it and error is strong"Could not initialize a installer"/strong. I have searched multiple forums and applied whatever they were suggesting. Following is the screenshot attached I have been receiving.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VKpb0.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fVEkm.png" alt="enter image description here"  What I have tried so far  ul liTried the "JFX14" comment,  ol liDisable your Firewall by going to System PreferencesSecurity &amp; Privacy. Click the Firewall tab then click the lock icon at the bottom of the window this will enable you to turn the Firewall on or off./li liBe sure you're not connected to a VPN or Proxy. &lt; (I was able to install the latest uTorrent when I disconnected from my VPN). https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5818206/li /ol/li /ul  <answer214077> Download a previous version of µTorrent. I had the same problem, downloaded 1.6.5. Works flawlessly.  <answer227849> Although I never got the answer, but I have found an alternative solution.  I've used Transmission for the Torrents.   Pros  ul litorent works, almost every torrent/li lidoesn't crash/li /ul  Cons  ul liUI sucks/li /ul  <answer259259> use this link it will download utorrent 1.8.8 and should not come up with Could not initialize the installer   http://www.utorrent.com/intl/en/downloads/complete/os/osx/track/beta  <comment253700> Please edit your post & let us know exactly what you did try, including links if appropriate. <comment253713> The linked page doesn't show what you have tried, please include the specific steps you've done so far directly into the question. <comment253732> So you are connecting to the Internet through a VPN? Are you sure that the VPN doesn't filter certain connections (including probably Torrents)? <comment253764> i have tried with and without vpn. <comment256557> My firewall is off but still facing issue after updating my OS to El Capitan. I think the issue is in the El Capitan OS so if some one found any solution than please mention it.... thanks <comment258430> Why isn't the new one working? Not only bittorrent even utorrent is causing the same error <comment258432> Don't know but the previous version worked for me <comment258433> Well i want to install the new version and and if it is happening to multiple users than there should be a solution or a remedy. Btw I tried the you said, but it is not working now. <comment258434> I am still using yosemite though, so maybe its something with el capitan <comment258436> Its is same on yosmite too. I have tried in yosmite as well thought it is something to yosmite, but it never worked on both <comment258437> That's odd. Sorry man that's all I've got. Why don't you send u torrent an email, they might have a solution. <comment258445> Dont know what to do but will try. Btw its bittorrent.  Thanks <comment291372> did you try installing the beta version? explained here: https://nabtron.com/utorrent-not-installing-el-capitan-solved/ <comment291415> Nope, I stop the hunt after I found Transmission
