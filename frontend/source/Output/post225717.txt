How to put Spotlight back into the middle of the screen <body> I have a Mid 2012 MacBook Pro. For some reason, Spotlight search now appears in the middle of the right hand edge of the screen, rather than the center. This is not catastrophic, but extremely odd. I have no idea how to put it back.  Any solutions, much appreciated!  <answer225718> Since El Capitan, you can move the Spotlight bar/window. Just click-and-drag it to wherever you want.  <answer225746> Click and hold the Spotlight icon on the menu bar, until the Spotlight window has returned to its original location.  <comment273957> Because you moved it there? Move it back. <comment273960> LOL. I feel stupid; ironically, I'm a computer science student - you'd think I'd have worked that out *blush*  Thanks! <comment273961> For your defence, there's no obvious UI to show it can be moved, and it had a fixed position in previous versions of OS X (which was terribly annoying). <comment369784> This should be the accepted answer, thanks!
