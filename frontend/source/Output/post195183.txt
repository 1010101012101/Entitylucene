How to change the color of Exchange's shared calendar in iCal in 10.10? <body> I've been in trouble for some days with the Exchange services on our Apple ecosystem. Right now, I want to change the color of the strongshared/strong exchange calendars. Changing the color of the local calendar works, same for iCloud ones, and same for my own calendar. See screenshot below. System is in french as you can seeâ€¦  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKGVw.png" alt="changing color of my own calendar"  strongBUT/strong it doesnt work the same for the shared calendar. Here is when I right clic the calendar :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JR2Ir.png" alt="right clic"  FYI when I right clic the name of the person above the calendar (on the screenshot it's behind the red rectangle) it just says something like (sorry for the translation) : open the delegate in a new window.  And then, once I clicked "read the informations", this is what I get. A great greyed selector :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1quos.png" alt="color selector greyed"  Of course when I click the color selector nothing happens. And when I click the "informations on the account" I get the account window, the one you get when you click in the menu on calendar  accounts.  Well, does anyone have an idea to change these damn colors ? I googled the thing but didn't find any consistent thing.  PS: there is a quite similar topic here on StackExchange but it doesn work for me since every shared calendar have the same name (and as you saw the calendar name is greyed too so it can't be changed).  THANKS !!  <answer224899> I had the same problem in a Office365 domain. The solution was to let the owner of the calendar change the color in her own iCal. Then this color will change in other users iCal also.    <answer227556> I too had the same problem with our Office 365 Shared Calendars, but because these aren't user accounts there was no way for the owner to change the colour as there is no owner on these kinds of calendar. I eventually figured out a way of changing the colours which I've created a tutorial for here on my blog: http://matt-stone.co.uk/change-colours-microsoft-office-365-shared-calendars-apple-calendar-os-x/  <comment277393> Hi Matt, while this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here.
