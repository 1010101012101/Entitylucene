Installing Windows 7 without a SuperDrive in Boot Camp on 2010 MBP <body> Just switched out my SuperDrive for an SSD on my 2010 MacBook Pro and am running into whale of a time trying to get Windows 7 installed onto the SSD for Boot Camp. Initially tried installing via an external DVD drive connected over USB, but that wouldn't let me boot into Windows 7 setup. Tried setting up a Windows 7 USB stick, and that wouldn't boot either.  I then tried following along here with the basic procedure of tricking VirtualBox into installing Windows 7 to your drive and going from there, but that created a non-bootable Windows partition.   There must be some way to get Windows 7 up and running WITHOUT having to reinstall the SuperDrive. Anyone have any success doing this?  BTW, I'm running 10.7.2, which means rEFIt is out, as it isn't Lion compatible.   <answer35768> Only way I was able to was by reinstalling the super drive I spent more time looking for a work around then the time it took to move the ssd to the hard drive location and reinstalling the super drive.  Sorry.  <answer36019> So, I just broke down and installed rEFIt. It actually worked - I could boot off of the Windows USB key and install. After installation, I immediately removed rEFIt, and everything seems to be working correctly after that. I doubt this is a 100% will work in every case procedure, but so far things seem to be back to normal.  <comment59270> +1 just did this shuffle to get my setup (SSD Lion boot drive + Magnetic drive with Bootcamp and OSX partitions) completed. rEFIt doesn't seem to have been updated in ages. Kind of a PITA, but after a couple of swaps, the procedure is pretty quick. Looking forward to MBPs that can boot Windows from USB - maybe the rumored WWDC 2012 refresh will provide.
