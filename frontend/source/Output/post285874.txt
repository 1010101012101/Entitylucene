Microsoft sculpt keyboard unresponsive on Mac OS Sierra <body> This is really frustrating me. I have a Microsoft Sculpt USB keyboard and have just got a new Macbook Pro with touch bar, and it is just not pairing with the keyboard.  The keyboard connects via a Nano tranceiver, which is plugged into my USB-C port via an adaptor. I can see that this is successfully connected in my system information:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9QPvy.png" alt="system information"  The first time I connected the keyboard, I got a keyboard setup assistant dialogue as described in this question prompting me to press some keys on the keyboard to set it up. When I press the keys as requested, nothing happens.  Now, nothing pops up, and the keyboard is just completely unresponsive. However, I can see the keyboard is there as one of my input sources when I click 'Modifier Keys...' in my keyboard system preferences: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6d4KY.png" alt="enter image description here".  Really pretty stuck on what to do here. I can't find any drivers or other settings that I might change to fix this.  <comment360641> See this [post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/273727/microsoft-surface-ergonomic-keyboard-not-recognized-as-a-proper-keyboard/273837#273837).  The Sculpt keyboard on MS' website dosen't list El Cap or Sierra as being supported. <comment360645> OK wow so it literally just won't work. I know it was working with my last MBP, but quite possibly that was still on Yosemite...  Thanks for the reply.
