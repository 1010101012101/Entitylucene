macOS Sierra and (wired) keyboard broken <body> I've updated my macbook pro to macOS Sierra and now my (apple) wired keyboard is completely broken.  I'm using a AZERTY wired keyboard (like the one on my macbook) but even if on my macbook every keys seems correct, on the wired keyboard two keys are reversed : @ and &lt; img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BgDe9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Also on both keyboards when I shift + click it doesn't select anymore on anything (text, file, spreadsheet, etc.) Same for Ctrl + click  It was working before the update.  hr  Also some strongreally weird behaviour/strong, for example on Steam. When I chat with someone from my desktop, there is no problem. But when I chat with him in-game I got these japanese or chinese characters whatever key I press :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JDsEf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also Shift+tab don't work to access at Steam while in-game.  hr  And here are just a few.... I keep discovering new ones every day.  emEverything was working perfectly before the update./em  <answer256714> I resolved all the issues. On the previous version (OS X) I was using Karabiner. On macOS Sierra since it was not working I've installed Karabiner-Elements.  I've deleted all of these, make sure to delete all the file. Rebooted. And now strongall is working properly/strong.
