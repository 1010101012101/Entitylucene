OSX floating text screensaver from command line <body> Everyone, I'm on OSX 10.10.3  I've tried a variety of different ways to change the message for the "message" screen saver.  So when I change it through the GUI, at least the following plist files are updated:  defaults read   precode/Users/username/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.ScreenSaver.Basic.UUID.plist ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.ScreenSaver.Basic.UUID.plist /code/pre  So when I try to update those files as root using:  defaults write code/Users/myusername/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.ScreenSaver.Basic.UUID.plist MESSAGE "test"/code  or   defaults write brcode~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.ScreenSaver.Basic.UUID.plist/code  after closing the prefs window, when I subsequently re-open the sys prefs and view the screen saver settings, they still show the old settings.  The following command to restart the prefs engine doesn't work either:  precodekillall cfprefsd /code/pre  If I modify the above files using defaults without opening the system prefs, then restart, strangely, the screensaver reverts to the default computer name after the restart.  Ultimately I'm trying to enforce a custom screensaver with floating text on all my OSX machines, so any tips/suggestions would be greatly helpful.  thanks!  <answer234009> Okay, I think I figured this out finally by using codedefaults/code:  precodedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleDict -dict path "/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/Computer Name.saver" moduleName "Computer Name" type 0 defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver.Basic MESSAGE "test4" killall cfprefsd /code/pre  This needs to be run as the current user. Just need to figure out how to run as root but to apply to all users. Probably a login script will do the trick. Hope this helps someone.
