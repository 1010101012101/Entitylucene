Export MOV to MP4 with Quicktime on Yosemite <body> I have a screen capture of my computer screen using QuickTime's Screen Recording feature, but that it saves too an codeMOV/code format. I'd like to export it too codeMP4/code, is that possible without installing anything else?  I'm using Yosemite, and I'm pretty sure I could do that with Mavericks.  <answer200993> After having your screen recorded and the file in MOV format, you could use iMovie to convert it to MP4.   ul liopen the file in iMovie/li liFile / Share / File... /li liadjust your preferences in the dialog box/li lipress "Next..."/li lithe created file will be in MP4/li /ul  Hope this helps.

Why does it have to be MP4 and/or what do you intend to do with the screen capture afterwards? <comment193226> Posting to a website, so I was going for a de facto web standard. <comment309283> It seems that in QuickTime 10.4 under 10.11.6 it appears the `File  Share  File...` option no longer exists.  I was able to export a video similarly for a tweet by using `File  Export  iPad, iPhone, iPod touch & Apple TV...`. <comment350907> I had a non-standard video resolution (750x1334) due to it being a screen capture from an iPhone 6, and tried Apple's Compressor product, but that failed to support the resolution. This worked perfectly.
