How to copy iTunes music from iTunes library to another, using my own music - not purchased <body> I have digitised my CD collection and have it on my iTunes on a PC. How can I add it to my partner's iTunes on a different PC?  <answer238444> You can:  ol liSend your partner the music files online (such as email)/li liBurn the files to a CD and transfer it to the other computer/li liCopy it to a thumb-drive and transfer it to the other computer/li /ol  iTunes should automatically open the music files. If it does not, (I'm assuming your PC is a Windows PC) right click the file, select 'Choose default program', and then choose iTunes in the list. After opening the file in iTunes, it should automatically add it to your partner's iTunes library.  <comment292420> You can copy it to a USB flash drive and import it back into iTunes, or re-rip the CDs.
