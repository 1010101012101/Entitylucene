I want to change clock from 12h to 24h mode via terminal <body> So I'm looking for the command to change from 12h to 24h. Is there even such a command? I mean I can do it with the GUI but I need to be able to do it via terminal so I can put it in a bash script.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ARQ7t.png" alt=""  Here I want instead of the 12h format a 24h format.  <answer75129> This is stored in the plist located at code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.menuextra.clock/code under the key codeDateFormat/code.  Here's a quick primer:  ul li12 Hour Mode with AM/PM:  codeEEE MMM d  h:mm:ss a/code/li li12 Hour Mode without AM/PM:  codeEEE MMM d  h:mm:ss/code/li li24 Hour Mode:  codeEEE MMM d  H:mm:ss/code/li /ul  To apply any of these formatting strings, you can either use the codedefaults/code command at the Terminal, or if you're looking for a more programmable method, you can use the codedo shell script/codesup1/sup directive within Applescript.  To apply these via the Terminal, open it up and run the following command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock DateFormat -string 'EEE MMM d  H:mm:ss' /code/pre  Substitute the string between the quotes with the version from above that you want.  For the changes to take immediate effect, codekill -SIGHUP SystemUIServer/code will do the trick. Otherwise they will take effect the next time you log out and back in or restart.  hr  sup1/sup CyberCiti Primer on Shell Scripting via Applescript  <comment87210> Do you mean to convert a given time? Or alter your system time display preference? Or something else? <comment87217> I want to alter my system time display preference (so the time display at the top right). I'll add this to make my question clearer. <comment87222> Beautiful, works like a charm. Thank you! <comment225889> Doesn't work for me on Yosemite 10.10.3. After I log off and log on again, the DateFormat is reset. <comment226204> So it *does* work for you, it just doesn't persist. <comment328814> The changes can be made immediately by restarting `SystemUIServer`. I've edited the post to reflect that.
