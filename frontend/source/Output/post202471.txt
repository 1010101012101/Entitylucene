Will a MacBook work if bought from a different country? <body> If I buy MacBook from Pakistan, will it work in Canada?  <answer202472> Yes it will. Just be sure you want the keyboard layout in the country where you buy. Changing the physical keys is practically a non-stater. Everything software will reconfigure properly.
