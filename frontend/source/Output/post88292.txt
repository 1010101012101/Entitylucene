Awkward dialog box: MZFinance.InAppBuyLoginRequired_message <body> I am getting the following dialog box for a few days:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JX4I3.png" alt="dialog box"  How can I find out which application is showing it and how can I solve the issue? I am on Mac OS 10.7.5.  strongEdit:/strong  ol liI followed the bassplayer7's answer (moving code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration /NetworkInterfaces.plist/code to trash and restarting) but it didn't solve the problem./li liI moved the hard drive of one my macbooks to another one. So, this might be the cause of the issue./li /ol  <answer88293> Very similar error messages have been noticed by developers and users alike.   Check out this blog post. It's not an identical error message but perhaps this will fix it for you as well:     AppleCare found the solution and it is rather simple. Now this solution has worked for me, but there is no guaranty that it will work for you.      Solution: Go to Macintosh HD (or whatever you call your HD in Finder)  Library  Preferences  SystemConfiguration      For there look for the file labeled: “NetworkInterfaces.plist”   So, you might test this remedy by making a good backup of your Mac and ensure you either have the network passwords and VPN setup files you need (or can regenerate them / reset your WiFi routers to passwords you know) and delete the NetworkInterfaces.plist file.  If that fails to work, you may need to open a Mac App store support ticket and involve Apple in troubleshooting this further. If you can document the steps needed to reproduce this error, please post a follow up question.   Chances are there is a bug in some Mac App Store software that was downloaded onto your computer and getting Apple support involved mit fix it for you and others at the same time.   <comment103335> Thanks bassplayer7 for the answer. It didn't solve the issue. See my edit please. <comment104014> @moshen. I've edited the answer to provide two more avenues for help - App Store support and trying to reproduce the issue on a cleanly installed account / Mac. You might live with the error since either would take about 30 minutes to try.
