Double-tap Home During Call <body> I cannot seem to access the list of open applications during a call by double-tapping the Home button. Is this the expected behaviour?  strongEdit: After restart, everything is fine. Recommend deleting question./strong  iOS 7.1.2, iPhone 5  <comment185798> Can you reach open apps if you first press the home button once (to return to the home screen) and then double tap? <comment185799> Not sure how to delete questions.. after phone restart it works fine. <comment185824> Below the body of the question there should be a "delete" link.
