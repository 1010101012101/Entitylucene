Can I disable tabs in the Finder? <body> I frequently use command-click in the titlebar to open the parent folder of a folder in the Finder.  In Mavericks, instead of opening a new window with the same view style, it opens a new tab in "column" view.  Is there any way to disable Finder tabs?  I don't want them, ever, and especially not when command-clicking a titlebar.  <answer111058> Finder → Preferences → General → uncheck Open folders in tabs instead of new windows
