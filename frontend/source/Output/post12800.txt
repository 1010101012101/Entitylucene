Workflow for dealing with incoming files to keep the file system tidy? <body> The cluttered desktops of our computers at home (Macs and PCs) made me think about a better workflow to deal with new files (self created or downloaded from the internet).  My question is:  ul liWhich workflow do you use to keep your desktop uncluttered and your file system tidy?/li /ul  I have a hierarchical folder structure for the data of my personal "projects" and for some general things like e. g. finance, photos, etc., but there are lots of incoming files which do not seem to fit in any of the existing categories and therefore clutter the desktop.  I tried to create an "Inbox" directory, which removed clutter from the desktop but on the other hand only moved the problem to another place.  The GTD* method (getting things done, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) has some useful tips and habits for managing tasks and I'm trying to use it, so it would make sense to create a "next action" on my list to "review file xy", or something similar. I could add a link to the file, but the question is where to store those files.br I tried creating a "temporary storage" directory where I put those files, but it filled very quickly.  * I'm currently using codeiGTD/code for managing my tasks and personal projects, but I'm considering buying codeThings/codeor codeOmniFocus/code, as iGTD is not developed any more and has some [for me] annoying bugs and limitations.   So I would be interested in other ways to manage the electronic "information overload", maybe using codetags/codeor a codedatabase/code like codeDevonThink Pro/code or ...?  <answer12842> You might look at Yojimbo from BareBones. File and information manager. Quite powerful. http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/  <answer12845> There is a utility to help deal with automatically organizing incoming files called Hazel.  <answer158721> What you need is DEVONthink. DEVONthink can help you organize your files in its database. When you have a new file in the filesystem, you simply drag it to the “sorter”, the inbox of the database.  After DEVONthink collects the file, it can apply auto classification rules and automatically group the file according to a group you defined. It can also tag the file just like iPhoto organizes photos.  <answer158727> I use Hazel which you can download with a 14 day trial     Hazel watches whatever folders you tell it to, automatically   organizing your files according to the rules you create. It features a   rule interface similar to that of Apple Mail so you should feel right   at home. Have Hazel move files around based on name, date, type, what   site/email address it came from (Safari and Mail only) and much more.   Automatically put your music in your Music folder, movies in Movies.   Keep your downloads off the desktop and put them where they are   supposed to be   My set up is to have file type specific folders on my Desktop.  ol liThe Desktop has a rule to move every file to a MISCH folder that is not a folder or an alias file./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0101q.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liMISCH folder uses a rule to move the files into other folders by type./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hjREj.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oND0C.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  This keeps my desktop uncluttered and I also do this for my Documents folder.  The files that have no strongtype folder/strong are left in the MISCH folder.  For me this is ok.   But you can do things slightly different:  You can do the above for files you drop on the desktop.  But also create a set of folders on the desktop that you may drop files into directly.  for example:  strongPersonal/strong,strongProjects completed/strong,strongProjects to complete/strong.  Each of the folders has its own rules and folders like in step 2 above. But for example with the strongProjects to complete/strong. you can add a rule that looks for tags and moves the files to the strongProjects completed/strong when the tag contains strongCompleted/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/27mIK.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8YjIa.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  To initiate the move you just add the strongCompleted/strong tag to the file ( kbdcmd/kbd + kbdalt/kbd+kbdi/kbd for multiple  files).  hr  Hazel also has many other rule options you can use.  <comment13420> Good question! I've been wireframing a (personal) solution for this for some time — nothing ready to show yet, though. Anyway, I'm eager to see what the possible contenders have come up with ;-) <comment13423> thanks for your comment - well, even if the solution is not ready to show, you could explain the approach or idea, IMHO. <comment186606> I feel really sorry for my poor English.
