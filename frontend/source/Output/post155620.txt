Show actual image size inside Apple Mail <body> Apple Mail offers the option to decrease or increase the size of an attached image. The options are "small", "medium" and "big".     But how can I display the actual size in KB or MB?   emI am using Mail 8.0 in OS X Yosemite./em  <answer155621> Not certain for Yosemite, but on Mavericks it's on the left of the window, level with where you choose the image size to send  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/poQnF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment183089> Thanks. It's the same under Yosemite. But if I have two or more pictures, PDFs etc, I just got the summarized size. <comment183090> Yes, same for Mavericks. Only workaround would be to drop them one at a time, remove, swap to the next. A bit tedious.
