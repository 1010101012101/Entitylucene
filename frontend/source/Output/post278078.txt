Is Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 (type C) possible? <body> Apple released Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter. Is it possible to connect an external device using type C (ie ASUS MB169B+) by connecting the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter with an Thunderbolt cable into the Mac (this is an older Mac before 2015)?  Can the MacBook (which only supports Thunderbolt 2) fully access the device which supports type C? The transmission traffic still won't compare with the real Thunderbolt 3 speeds but at least the Thunderbolt 2 ports are not useless!  <answer278082> All Mac with thunderbolt 2 are limited since thunderbolt 2 doesn't embed USB C. Even with the thunderbolt 2 to thunderbolt 3 adapter, you could physically connect a USB C display like the ASUS MB169B or the LG 4K Display and they won't work.   New Mac with USB C connectors will work and don't need the adapter.  whether you have the MacBook "one" or the MacBook Pro that combine thunderbolt 3 and USB C in one physical port, they should connect to USB C displays.   ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207448 LG 5k (thunderbolt)/li lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207447 LG 4k (USB)/li /ul  The only case where a thunderbolt 2 Mac can drive a new connector display with the adapter is if the display supports thunderbolt explicitly as opposed to USB. The LG 5k display is one such new monitor that would work with many thunderbolt 2 Mac. This results in lower resolution, though - 3840 x 2160 @ 60Hz  <answer296442> You can do this with a simpler and cheaper USB-C female to USB-A male adapter. For example you could buy this:  https://www.amazon.com/Lemeng-USB3-0-Connector-Converter-Adapter/dp/B01ABTHI7C  Note that this only works with USB devices, i.e. for example monitors that need the alternate-mode DisplayPort signal won't work.
