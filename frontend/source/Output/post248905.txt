Keyboard shortcut for stopping and restarting a command line application <body> To stop and restart a Rails application that's running on the command line, I usually do Control + C, and then use the up arrow to get the previous command for running codebin/rails s/code.  Is there a keyboard shortcut like Control + C that tells the application to stop, and start up again anew?  I'm currently using Terminal.  <answer248907> You mean in a single keystroke?  No.  Depending on whether the daemon supports restarting itself/reloading its configuration, you might be able to restart it with a HUP, e.g.  precodesudo killall -HUP httpd /code/pre  but A. that's not a keystroke, and B. it requires the daemon to have code to support doing that.
