How to force the Mac to not expire passwords? <body> This morning, when I logged into my Mac, it forced me to change my password. Because I'm unlikely to remember a new password, I had to choose an insecure password that will be easier to remember.  It also won't let me change the password back.  I went to the Security &amp; Privacy settings and found NOTHING that can control this behavior.  Everything on the Internet that is even remotely related is about Active Directory, but I'm sure this thing isn't using Active Directory.  How do you make a Mac NOT do this?  <answer287259> The feature is controlled by a tool called codepwpolicy/code. Running codepwpolicy -getaccountpolicies/code outputs an XML document. One of the things found in this XML is this:  precode&lt;key&gt;policyCategoryPasswordChange&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;         &lt;dict&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;policyContent&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;policyAttributeCurrentTime &amp;gt; policyAttributeLastPasswordChangeTime + (policyAttributeExpiresEveryNDays * 24 * 60 * 60)&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;policyIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;ProfilePayload:deadbeef-b187-1337-1ee7-abcdef123456:maxPINAgeInDays&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;policyParameters&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;dict&gt;                         &lt;key&gt;policyAttributeExpiresEveryNDays&lt;/key&gt;                         &lt;integer&gt;90&lt;/integer&gt;                 &lt;/dict&gt;         &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  Delete that from the XML document and then consume the altered document using:  precodepwpolicy -setaccountpolicies &lt;file.xml&gt; /code/pre  and the problem should go away. But there is a pitfall. If you dump the XML using the shell's code&gt;/code operator, edit the file, and pass it back to codepwpolicy/code, you'll get this error:  precodeError: The data is not in the correct format. /code/pre  The reason for this error is that codepwpolicy -getaccountpolicies/code prints the following before printing the XML:  precodeGetting global account policies /code/pre  <comment362544> Is it a managed, work machine, etc, or does it use your AppleID as sign-in? In 25 years of using Macs I've never had one force a password change on me. <comment362555> Please open Terminal and enter `pwpolicy -u your_username --get-effective-policy` and add the result to your question. <comment362556> @Tetsujin You can also set a local password policy with `(sudo) pwpolicy ...`. A pw reset is not necessarily related to OD or AD - but very, very uncommon in a normal consumer environment! <comment362617> @klanomath, `pwpolicy -u your_username --get-effective-policy` didn't print anything relevant (and the man page says `--get-effective-policy` is deprecated), but you led me in the right direction, and I've found the answer. Thanks! <comment362619> @klanomath I just posted it. <comment362621> Do you remember whether you **set** this policy in the past? <comment362622> I know for a fact that I did not set this policy. I wasn't even aware of the `pwpolicy` tool until you mentioned it. <comment362625> @klanomath I edited it. (extra text to reach required length)
