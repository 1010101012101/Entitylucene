When saving a document or editing a file name, with the focus on the string itself, why does CMD+Delete move the file or folder to the trash? <body> To be more specific, I am saving a file from my markdown editor. Within the save dialog box, I navigate to the folder I wish to save the file. I then decide to change the name of the file. I put my cursor at the end of the text string and hit CMD + Delete. The expected behavior is to delete the entire string. Instead, this deletes the previously selected folder I highlighted in the dialog box.   Typically, I expect CMD + Delete to remove an entire line of text. I also tested this with renaming a file. If my focus is on the string name of the file, why would CMD+delete remove the file, when Option+Delete removes individual words as expected.   I can do screen shots or short movie if this is confusing. I don't recall this happening previously but I'm not often creating files outside of Python.  13" rMBP using 10.10.1  <answer166651> If the file name is highlighted then just use Delete, not the CMD+Delete.  The CMD+Delete will also delete the file on my MBA with 10.9.5 Finder.  <answer166659> when saving a file, by default the entire name excluding .extension ought to be selected, so just starting to type will rename it.  To navigate,    ul liforward arrow will go to the end of the filename, before the extension  /li liup arrow [or back arrow initially, until the fully-selected name is 'broken'] will go to the beginning,  /li lidown arrow to the end, if you want to accept the original name but add prefix/suffix etc /li /ul  <comment195352> The downside to what you recommended is that for Delete alone to remove all the text I have to have it all highlighted. Delete removes it character by character unless I have everything selected. It just goes against the behavior I'm used to in every other instance when I'm manipulating strings.  Thanks! <comment195354> It is actually simple, just double click (slow click, otherwise it will open the file) on the file name to highlight all. <comment195357> I understand that, I'm just curious about why the default behavior of CMD+Delete when the focus is a string (file name, saving a file, folder name, or bit of code in Sublime) is different in the Finder than other places.  The basic conclusion is just don't use CMD+Delete when dealing with file names. Thanks! <comment195364> I agree, but in the File menu the cmd+delete is the "move to trash", why it does that when you just want to change the name text? well that's another story :) <comment195368> It basically adds a few more keys to my 'normal' workflow for deleting a line. For unhighlighted things, I'll just have to be more careful when deleting. Thanks!
