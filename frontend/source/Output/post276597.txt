How can I configure write-enabled auto-mounting of NTFS drives? <body> I am using macOS Sierra 10.12.3  I'm new to Macs and just encountered the problem, that Macs don't open ntfs formatted external drives by default.  Well, since I am not new to linux, I just added the following line to /etc/fstab:  precodeUUID=xxx-xxx-xx none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  Unfortunatly that did not work. After I plugged in the drive. So I tried to mount it manually by: codemount -a/code That gave me the error message, that codenone/code does not exist. So I created a folder code/Volumes/external/code and changed fstab to:  precodeUUID=xxx-xxx-xx /Volumes/external ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  That worked! GREAT!   BUT as soon as I plugged out the drive, the folder was deleted automatically. And after a new plugin of the drive, it could not mount, because the folder was missing.  So my main question is: strongHow can I configure write-enabled auto-mounting of NTFS drives?/strong  <comment348167> Have you tried using the path that the Finder creates when you plug in the drive when there's no entry in `/etc/fstab` instead of `/Volumes/external`? <comment348169> No, I haven't. Good hint. I will try it out this evening and report. Thanks!
