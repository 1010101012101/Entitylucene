How come Apple Mail reports 'outgoing message' although I haven't written any? <body> When I open the Mail application (vers. 5.3, OS X 10.7.5 Lion), it contacts all mail servers (several POP3 and IMAP), which is reported in the Mail Activity section in the lower left. However, I recently experienced that it also reported 'outgoing message(s)' there on this occasion, even though I haven't written or drafted any message.   Is there an explanation for this, or might this be caused by spam or even malware? There is nothing in the Sent folders...   (Also, is there an internal log of the OS X mail system that would show if a message actually went out?)
