HiDPI on external monitor (Dell u2515h) with Macbook Pro <body> So I have Dell U2515H connected to my Macbook Pro 15" Mid 2014 (integrated graphics) and when I try to run it in 16:9 1280x720 HiDPI (I'm using switchresx) resolution it has no effect. However, when I choose any other 16:10 HiDPI resolution like 1280x800 it works just fine but obviously it cuts the screen. Does anyone know what could be the problem? It is very weird that 16:10 resolutions are OK but 16:9 just don't work, given that native monitor aspect ratio is 16:9.   <answer228855> I encountered the very same problem while setting HiDPI mode for my Macbook Pro with SwitchResX. As the HiDPI resolutions didn't fit, I made my own ones.  Here's how it goes:  ul liFollow the instructions on SwitchResX's website on how to temporarily disable "System Integrity Protection"/li liOn the SwitchResX panel for the DELL screen, go to the "Custom Resolutions" tab and create your desired resolutions under the "Scaled resolution" category./li liThe pixels x lines you scale to are 2 times the "feeling" you want to get, e.g. 3840 x 2160 for a Full HD (1920 x 1080) feeling./li /ul  Disabling the SIP made the 720p resolution you mentioned work for me as well.  <comment281699> I have the same problem... any news? <comment281844> don't work with @Vajs question..., I have the same problem <comment282019> @r1si , what exactly doesn't work? This is a solution to the exact same problem. Following these instructions you can create a custom resolution that matches the 16:9 scale, plus disabling SIP makes the bundled 16:9 ones work correctly <comment282113> no... I disable sip , add custom resolution, but nothing see only 3840 x 2160 resolution without HiDPI choose here a video of the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78X4b-Bfpn8
