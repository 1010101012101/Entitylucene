<answer285149> This was a known issue for this model MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, coverage for this has now ended.  However, there are a few things you can do to minimise the problem.  stronggfxCardStatus/strong  Many users have found that using gfxCardStatus will reduce these issues most of the time. My experience with many users is that versions 1.8.1 and 2.1 seem to be the best for your particular model MBP, even though more recent versions fixed a number of bugs.  So, I’d like you to give version 1.8.1 a go for a while and see how you go. If you’re not happy with that, then try version 2.1 instead.  NOTE: Unfortunately, there were two distinct issues that affected your particular model of MBP. gfxCardStatus was designed to address a hardware problem that occurs on a number of models, including yours. However, your model was also prone to being affected by a software issue that was unique to your model. If your model is affected by that as well, then version 2.3 may be a better choice.  So, in summary, I would start with 1.8.1 and see how you go. If you’re not happy, then try 2.1. Then go to 2.3 if you're still not satisfied. strongDo not try any other versions for your model MBP!/strong  strongGoogle Chrome/strong  If you use Google Chrome I would strongly consider not doing so. However, if you need to, there’s actually a setting in Google Chrome that may help you:  ol liGo to Chrome  Preferences/li liScroll down to the bottom/li liClick on emShow advanced settings…/em/li liScroll down to the emSystem/em heading/li liUncheck the emUse hardware acceleration when available/em option/li /ol  strongAdobe Photoshop/strong  If you use Adobe Photoshop, you may be able to tinker with Photoshop’s settings as well. Depending on the version you use, if you go to Photoshop’s Preferences and look under the Performance category, there should be a section for GPU Settings. By going into its Advanced Settings you may be able to try different options for the mode of use. It will probably default to Normal, but you could change it to Basic and see whether Photoshop plays more nicely with your MBP. Under GPU settings you could also switch off OpenGL Drawing altogether, but that may limit some functionality.  strongMac OS El Capitan/strong  There are a couple of things you can do within El Capitan:  ul liYou’re probably already aware of this one – but for your MBP you should have an additional setting under System Preferences  Energy Saver for Automatic graphics switching. Playing with this and the other Graphics option (for better battery life) may be useful./li liNow this one is not so obvious:  ol liGo to System Preferences/li liClick on Accessibility/li liSelect Display (in the left-hand column)/li liTick the Reduce transparency box (on the right-hand side)/li liExit System Preferences/li /ol/li /ul  Basically, to draw/display transparency in the GUI (windows etc) it needs a lot of graphics power. Not a good idea for your MBP I’m afraid.  <answer287511> I have the same model with the same issues.   I've come across what aims to be a permanent fix instead of the gfxCardStatus work arounds.   The work arounds themselves seem to work ok for the average user, where most people suggest to install gfxCardStatus, and then use "Integrated Only" option, so that it can't actually switch back and forth from the 'discrete' Nvidia GT 330M graphics card, (which is causing the kernel panics and graphics glitches). This works well for those that can handle the basic ~220mb graphics, and that don't need to connect to an external monitor (as the better graphics card Nvidia GT 330M, is what controls the external monitors).   However, I'm one of the people that needs the most from the graphics card and needs to connect to an external monitor occasionally. So.. I've come across the solution from Louis Rossmann and associates..   For yours/mine's particular MBP models' issue (in the mid 2010 15" MBP), the motherboard repair guru Louis Rossmann and associates have discovered that the problem with this exact model only is that there's a $2.50 capacitor that goes faulty, and causes random power shortages to the graphics card. Which is actually what is causing the issues, not the graphics card itself!  I have the same MBP 2010 15" model, and have just ordered the replacement capacitors myself. From what I've read, almost everyone who does this mod completely fixes the issues with the graphics card kernel panics and other issues with the screen glitches etc, and when it switches to the 'discrete' graphics card (Nvidia GT 330M).  Here's the link to his youtube video on replacing the capacitor on the motherboard.. Should you trust an Apple Genius when they tell you it's a graphics processor?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzcgT_fiVTA&amp;feature=youtu.be   There's also forum posts on the subject, which state which exact capacitors to buy. Of the 3 choices, people were having some issues with the 'ceramic' smaller capacitors, but pretty much 100% success with the 'aluminium' ones.  The aluminium one most people are using with great success is the: "Panasonic EEF-CX0D331R".  This is the Canadian link I was given, to the exact aluminium one I bought (but I bought from an Australian supplier, stock coming from UK): https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/EEF-CX0 D331R/PCE4275CT-ND/816445  Hope that helps some of you. This is MacBook Pro 2010 15" only.  (exact same capacitor issues but in a different location on 2008-9 MBP).  PS: I still think there is 'something' different about Mac OSX Sierra, as I hadn't had these problems for a VERY long time, and now they're back every day, worse than ever, since installing Mac OSX Sierra. Seems to have popped up with MANY other people since upgrading to Sierra.   <comment359555> Sounds like the NVidia GPU problem - there was a free recall on those models, but it ended last year - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203554 <comment359582> So 10.12.5 or El Capitan? Because 10.12 is Sierra, El Cap goes only to 10.11.6.
