What is "x-apple-ql-id://*"? <body> I have a process called codex-apple-ql-id://*/code (* being a bunch of letters, numbers and "-"). Is this a legitimate process? I am wondering because it looks very fishy.  <answer207381> That seems to be a legitimate process. It's a schema that belongs to QuickLook, but Apple doesn't have much information freely available about it. I don't think is a reason to be alarmed, just kill the process (but save your work before, just in case).  <comment250104> I also found QuickLook information when googling, but it was weird that there were so few results.
