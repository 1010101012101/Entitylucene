What is the net weight and outside size of the iPad mini box when new? <body> What are the physical dimensions of one iPad mini box?   I want to order two iPads mini and then have them shipped in one box but I'm worried about the width, height, depth &amp; size of the outer box because I'll do international shipping.  Precise measurements are very much appreciated as I wish to be specific about the rates &amp; costs.  <answer74108> strongFor the reference:/strong  strongLength/strong: 21.3 CM br / strongWidth/strong: 14.7 CM br / strongHeight/strong: 3.3 CM br / strongGross Weight/strong: 0.5 KG  <answer75652> ul liLength: 21.3 cm /li liWidth: 14.7 cm/li liHeight: 3.3 cm /li liGross weight: 0.5 kg/li /ul  <answer76031> I am ordering one, but it's en route so I can't measure but I can give you the shipping weight, from FedEx tracking, 1.6 lbs.  Mind you, that is actual shipping weight, including the additional outer packing materials covering the retail box. I believe the retail sealed box kit weighs 1.2 lbs. (gathering from various sources on the net).   <comment83635> I had hoped to get the outer shipping shell to get you an answer, but have you been able to get someone that is selling them to answer this yet? <comment86136> "When new"??? After songs, videos, and apps are put into it, it will weigh more, I guess??? <comment87820> @GEdgar Surely it does. `;)`
