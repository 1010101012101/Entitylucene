How to add a "mobile data ON/OFF" shortcut? <body> This is one feature I have to toggle frequently and there doesn't seem to be a shortcut for this. By default it is a 3 step click : codeSettings -&gt; Mobile -&gt; Mobile Data/code.  Is there a way to add a shortcut for this ?  The web site brdrck.me/settings/wifi used to give custom shortcuts, but not anymore.  <answer182367> Without a jailbreak, that's not possible.
