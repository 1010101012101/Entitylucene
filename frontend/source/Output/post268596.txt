Using Command Line how to make the user an Administrator <body> As soon I bind a Mac to the AD Domain, I usually log into the Mac with the user account.   Of course, under System Preference, User &amp; Groups, the user account is marked as: Managed, Mobile  My second step, is to make the user an Administrator account because I want to allow him/her to install/remove stuff from her/his Mac.  So, with the GUI, System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  I select the user name and I check mark the option: enable Allow user to administer this computer and I restart the machine and everything works fine.  The user now is an Admin for that machine.  Question, how do I perform the above process with the command line in Terminal?  Not the bind process, but to make the user Admin for that specific machine.  <answer268602> precodesudo dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership username /code/pre  where ‘username’ is the username of the user you would like to make an admin.  codesudo/code since making changes like this requires elevated privileges.br codedscl/code is the Directory Service command line utility.br code./code is the local machine.br code-append/code allows you to add a new key to a record path.br code/Groups/admin/code is the record path for the key.br codeGroupMembership/code is the key you would like to assign a value.br codeusername/code is the value for the key.  <comment337302> I've always used `dscl . -append /groups/admin GroupMembership USERNAME` and it seems to work for me. <comment337304> @Icon I guess ‘append’ is more syntactically correct, but both should work. I've edited my answer to use that though, thanks.
