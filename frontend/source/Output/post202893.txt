Editing and syncing a pdf file on Mac and iPad through iBooks <body> I'd like to work on a draft pdf file on both a Mac and an iPad and see the edits syncing invisibly in the background.  I create a new directory  precodemkdir ~/latex /code/pre  and save the following latex in code~/latex/lipsum-novel.tex/code  precode\documentclass{report} \usepackage{lipsum}  \begin{document} \lipsum[1-30] \end{document} /code/pre  then typeset it  precodepdflatex lipsum-novel /code/pre  Now I have the pdf file code~/latex/lipsum-novel.pdf/code  I drag that pdf file from Finder to the iBooks window, and from this answer, we know that iBooks buries the pdf file in code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/code  I'm guessing that I can now delete code~/latex/lipsum-novel.pdf/code  precoderm ~/latex/lipsum-novel.pdf /code/pre  All good. iBook took over the draft pdf. My objective now is to modify this draft pdf on both OS X and on an iPad (with the modifications synced in the background).  Before I even worry about syncing to iBooks on an iPad, I start by striking through some text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Ki1M.png" alt="One strikethrough"  Already Preview warns me that (as with all OS X native files such as pdf files) "The original document can't be changed."  Fine. I save the modified file in code~/Documents/lipsum-novel copy.pdf/code.  Now already iBooks has gone out of sync with Preview. If I exit iBooks and reload, I will be looking at the pdf file buried by iBooks, not on the file I edited. If I add a new strikethrough  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nWXM7.png" alt="after two strikethroughs"  That hardly helps. I've just introduced yet a third pdf file.  How do I get iBooks to save my edits in its own copy (and sync it with an iPad).  <answer202991> You don't need to go into Library/Containers to get to iBooks, you can just drag the PDF file onto the iBooks window. You can then delete the old one  <answer203175> It appears that only synchronizing the original, pristine copy of a pdf file is supported. Synchronizing edits is not implemented, or at least similar questions on discussions.apple.com remain unanswered.  <comment244861> Yes, I know. The trouble is that after double-clicking on the icon of the pdf file inside iBooks, I am unable to edit the file and keep it inside iBooks. The copy pdf file that I save (in ~/Documents, i.e. without attempting to save deep inside ~/Library/Containers) remains external to iBooks. iBooks does not know the edits, and hence cannot sync them to iOS.
