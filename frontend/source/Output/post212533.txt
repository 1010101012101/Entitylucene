Uninstalled CleanMyMac still shows notifications <body> I had installed CleanMyMac before, and have already uninstalled it.  However, I got the notification saying "It's time to clean your mac".  How is this possible and how can I avoid this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LXiyC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer212534> The interesting thing about uninstalling CleanMyMac is that the best application for the job is, in fact CleanMyMac.  If you set it to uninstall itself, it will tidily clean up its own leftovers before finally quitting &amp; trashing itself.  It is, in fact, probably quicker to re-install it, then get it to uninstall itself than to pick apart where the leftovers are.  Ref: MacPaw FAQsbr How To Uninstall CleanMyMac 2?  &amp;br How to Uninstall CleanMyMac 3  <answer239577> Open System Preferences / Notifications / Scroll down till Clean My Mac is visible and uncheck all the boxes. Done.  <answer271706> go to your command line, code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code and remove the code.plist/code file reading codecleanmymac/code  <comment294046> This solution will not clean leftover files <comment329584> Also the notifications seem to reset themselves back on after a restart <comment337058> To stop them coming back on reboot, System Prefs / Users & Groups / Login Items. Remove CleanMyMac from the list. <comment366724> The problem is, once you upgrade to macOS Sierra CleanMyMac 2 no longer runs, so it can't be used to uninstall itself.
