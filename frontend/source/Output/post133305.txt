Modify the compose action for the keyboard <body> In my keyboard layout, I have a compose key, which works by putting an codeaction="compose"/code in the appropriate place in the keylayout file. It works well, but I'm not satisfied with the rules for this key. In particular, I want to be able to add rules, for example ♫ + o + * should give me a ⊗.  I already found this: Add Compose key to OS X but they seem to use a different method for adding the compose key, so editing the codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code does not do anything for me.  Is there any file that I can edit to add these rules?
