Unable to connect to localhost on my development machine <body> I'm configuring a new Web development machine using the very complete and well-written guide published by Echo Software but I cannot connect to localhost after following/checking every step. My only changes were using PHPv7.0 instead of 5.6, and disabling MySQL strict mode because some third-party software I need to run requires looser rules.  I can ping code127.0.0.1/code, codelocalhost/code and code*.dev/code domains successfully (all three commands return the exact same output):  precode$ ping -c1 127.0.0.1  $ ping -c1 localhost $ ping -c1 test.dev PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.092 ms  --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss /code/pre  However I still cannot connect to any of those over HTTP (same results when using Safari Chrome or Firefox):  precode$ curl http://localhost curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 80: Connection refused /code/pre  I have asserted that Apache, PHP, and dnsMasq are all running by running codebrew services list/code, and that all are properly configured:  precode$ brew services list Name    Status              Plist dnsmasq started /Users/{mysusername}/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist httpd22 started /Users/{mysusername}/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.httpd22.plist mysql   started /Users/{mysusername}/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist php70   started /Users/{mysusername}/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php70.plist $ apachectl -v Server version: Apache/2.2.31 (Unix) $ apachectl -t Syntax OK     $ php -v PHP 7.0.10 (cli) (built: Aug 21 2016 19:14:33) ( NTS ) /code/pre  I don't see port 8080 listed when I run a port scan on 127.0.0.1, but as I understand it is autoforwarded by codepf/code.  I have already:  ul liChecked my code/etc/hosts/code file: it has not been tampered with. /li liDisabled my firewall: no change whatsoever./li liDouble-checked every step from the guide./li liFollowed the same guide twice just months ago: both machines are now happy./li liRead every similar question/answer I could find, but none helped./li liLooked for output in the Apache and PHP log files: nothing there either./li liRun out of hypothesis.../li /ul  Any help would be greatly welcome!  hr  Edit: I also have coderbenv/code and codedocker/docker-compose/code setup on the machine, I hope that it's not conflicting because I need them both as well.  <comment314027> Can you curl or telnet to port 8080 ? <comment314029> @Mark: No, I cannot either. ```$ curl localhost:8080 curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused```
