macOS Sierra: Increase mouse cursor speed beyond System Preferences maximum <body> I previously used BetterTouchTool to override the maximum mouse cursor speed in System Preferences. However, as of macOS Sierra, this is no longer possible according to the developer (source).  I am not sure if this is due to a technical limitation on part of the application, or if it indeed is impossible to override the maximum mouse cursor speed.  Note that I am referring explicitly to the emMouse/em cursor speed â€“ not the Trackpad cursor.br I am looking to increase the cursor speed of my Logitech Performance Mouse MX (without the use of Logitech Control Center!).  So the question is: How can the maximum mouse cursor speed be overridden (with a permanent setting) in macOS Sierra? Perhaps it could be done by a Terminal command or editing a plist file, but the solution could entail a third-party app.  <answer295848> I tried using this utility (http://triq.net/mac/mouse-acceleration) with a Dell Mouse, and it seems to help increase the tracking speed of a mouse or trackpad beyond the default maximum value (up to 6 times). This tool also works with macOS Sierra. Try and see if it works with your Logitech mouse.  <comment373702> Thanks! I tried it, but 6x is not fast enough and seems to be roughly what System Preferences and/or BTT offers.
