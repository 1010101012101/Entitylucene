What extension is this? <body> I was watching a programming video on YouTube and the instructor had the extension below installed. It looks very useful â€“ instead of just showing open apps, it shows a wide range of default and customizable items.  Does anyone know what it is?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z6XUy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268977> Looks like SuperTab ($20, free trial).  <comment337861> Cool. Thanks! (I haven't used extensions much in OSX).
