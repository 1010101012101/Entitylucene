iphone view picture date <body> Since this took me awhile to find and a few of the apps here are old I thought I would share several iphone date viewing apps.   The ones I have tried:   strongExif Wizard/strong  Good app that I have used for about 2 years. Nothing fancy it just lets you view the metadata. It is only 0.4 MB.   ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/exif-wizard/id387652357?mt=8/li /ul  strongKoredoko - Exif and GPS Viewer/strong  Good app that I have used for about 2 years. Nothing fancy it just lets you view the metadata. It is only 4.5 MB.   ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/koredoko-exif-and-gps-viewer/id286765236?mt=8/li /ul  strongCamera Awesome/strong  Ok app. It is 48.5 MB. It doesn't do anything exciting to me. I rather use the regular camera app for taking pictures instead of this because of the size. It can view metadata.   ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera-awesome/id420744028?mt=8/li /ul  The ones I have not tried:  strongFlickd/strong  Size: 0.3 MB   ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flickd/id305580150?mt=8/li /ul  strongPhoto Date/strong  Size: 3.4 MB  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-date/id605218393?mt=8/li /ul  strongPhoto Investigator: View, Edit, Remove Metadata; GPS, EXIF.../strong  Size: 3.5 MB  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-investigator-view-edit/id571574618?mt=8/li /ul  strongPixelgarde/strong  Size: 4.8 MB  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelgarde-photo-privacy-editor/id414677492?mt=8/li /ul  strongMetadata Cut - View and Remove Metadata/strong  Size: 21.5 MB  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metadata-cut-view-remove-metadata/id568689108?mt=8/li /ul  <answer192521> Exif Viewer Free by Fluntro https://appsto.re/us/y71w6.i  Size 1.4 MB, have free version and paid version ($2.99 US)  It shows "2 days ago" etc but if you tap on that it will show actual date and time stamp  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fpxzA.jpg" alt="Exif viewer feeds view" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aRkWf.jpg" alt="Exif viewer detail view"  DEMO video of App https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aLHWjPyfOY  Video showing how to use app extension to view exif details from Apple's photos app https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xabwnKY-Ubk
