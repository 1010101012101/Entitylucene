How can I see messages I send in Mail 5's Conversation View? <body> I love Mail 5's new Conversation View. But, I don't like that it only shows messages sent strongto/strong me, and doesn't show the messages strongI send/strong.  Is there a way to show both messages I receive and messages I send in Conversation View?  <answer18257> Go to Mail- Preferences- Viewing and check codeInclude related messages/code (under View conversations: at the bottom).  This will show "related messages", which (as far as I can tell) means messages that you send in the same conversation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pEYid.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment19946> This can also be turned on and off using the "Show Related Messages" item in the View menu <comment22224> What an utterly bizarre default option on the part of Apple. -1
