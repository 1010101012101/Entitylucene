Mac book <BACK> button on keyboard <body> I need to know where is the back space in a MAC book pro keyboard. I am new to the Mac, and not familiar with the keyboard layout. Help  <answer47136> The kbddelete/kbd button is the equivalent of backspace on Windows, while kbdfn/kbd + kbddelete/kbd is the equivalent of the Windows delete.  <comment53985> Ok then what is the Mac equivalent for the Delete button in Windows ? <comment53986> fn + delete. I've updated the answer.
