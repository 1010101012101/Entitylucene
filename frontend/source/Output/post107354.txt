Can I use a Thunderbolt cable to connect an iPad to a MacBook Air as second display? <body> Is it possible to use a Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable to connect a new-generation iPad with a new-generation MacBook Air so that the iPad can be used as a 2nd monitor?  <answer107357> No, the iPad doesn't have thunderbolt, nor the capacity to function as a screen for another device by any cable.  You could use your iPad as an external display over the network though (remember your Macbook can create a network if you don't have one), there are quite a few apps that do this,  <answer162629> The app Duet Display allows you to use any iOS device as an external display and your Mac is running at least OS 10.9. The connection happens entirely over the 30-pin or Lightning cable which might make it lag less than a wifi solution. It's available on the app store.  <comment125895> iPad doesn't have a thunderbolt port, to my knowledge, so no. <comment190223> Do note that the reviews all note that the app is quite buggy.
