How to have certain *windows* start in different spaces during start up? <body> Is there a way to have certain emwindows/em of an app open in specific spaces?  Whenever I start up my computer, all my log in items get mashed into one space.  I'm using OSX 10.7.5 Lion  strongEdit:/strong I would like to use textedit in any space, but if I assign it to space#3, for instance, then everytime I use textedit, it switches to space#3 unless I manually drag it to the space I need. Is there a way to do this?  <answer90341> Put the app on the space you want it on.  Right click on the app in the Dock and select "Options - Assign To... This Desktop"  Then the apps should keep their assignments, even through log out and reboot.  <comment106021> Which OS X version are you using? <comment106027> @patrix updated it. thanks! <comment106208> But what if I want to be able to use textedit in any window, but there are specific .txt files that I want to always have in certain spaces?
