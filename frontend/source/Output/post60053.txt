Toggle the keyboard language by *holding* a button? <body> On my Linux computer, my keyboard switches from English to Serbian when I stronghold/strong the Caps Lock key. For example, to write č all I have to do is hold Caps Lock, and press the key where č is on the Serbian keyboard (in this case, they key is ; on the English keyboard). When I release Caps Lock, the keyboard  "switches back" to English, so that if I press ; I get ; as desired. Super useful.  strongIs there a way to replicate this behavior on OS X?/strong  <answer60074> You can use KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_SERBIAN&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;inputsourceid_equal&gt;com.apple.keylayout.Serbian&lt;/inputsourceid_equal&gt;   &lt;/vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_NONE, Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_SERBIAN, Option::KEYTOKEY_AFTER_KEYUP, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_ENGLISH&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_ENGLISH is defined in inputsourcedef.xml. You can see the IDs of input sources from EventViewer.app. Caps lock can be remapped to an F-key with PCKeyboardHack.  <answer60095> You can easily switch from the Serbian keyboard to the US keyboard or vice versa by pressing strongCommand-Space/strong. To set this up:  Go to strongSystem Preferences.../strong, strongLanguage &amp; Text/strong, strongInput Sources/strong, and select both the Serbian and English keyboard layouts. Select the check box next to  strongShow Input menu in menu bar/strong. Make sure that under strongInput source shortcuts/strong that strongSelect previous input source:/strong is set to strongCommand-Space/strong.  This is all you need to do.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4YQin.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer92041> The Alt key gives you access to a number of non ascii characters that depend on the layout you use.  On a standard US keyboard, pressing Alt+underbar creates a " ` " under which the vowel you'll type after will come: " à " if I type Alt+underbar followed by a.  In your case, the US Extended layout will give you access to all the accents that you need to use in Serbian. For ex, Alt+v followed by c will give you č.  You need to keep the Keyboard Viewer opened to get used to the various possible modifications but once you get the set that is used in your language you won't need it anymore.  <answer92054> If you're on 10.7 Lion or newer, you can also press the c key down until it shows a list of all c characters with various decorations.  <comment69187> Actually, this seems close to what I want (although it's a tad too involved to be practical). <comment69188> This actually isn't what I am asking for. I know you can toggle to, and from, a keyboard layout. What I want is to hold Caps Lock as a modifier key. For example, Shift modifies the letter pressed to upper case. I want Caps Lock to modify the keyboard to be Serbian, for the duration of the press. <comment69309> You can define a different modifier key other than Command-Space, by clicking on the Keyboard Shortcuts button in the dialog shown above. <comment80844> The KeyRemap4MacBook is the way to do it, I think. A similar solution with AutoHotKey works on Win 8 for me. <comment108079> This is awesome! I wish I could +10! Thank you for improving my life.
