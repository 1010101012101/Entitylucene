Trouble Syncing yahoo email with microsoft outlook 2011 mac <body> I'm running mac os siera 10.12.3 and I'm having a hard time syncing my yahoo email account with microsoft outlook 2011.  It will start to sync, slowly download some emails, and then repeatedly prompt me for my password to save in the keychain, or else just get stuck and the pinwheel will spin.  I've tried deleting the internet password entry in my keychain access, deleting the account in the microsoft database utility.app, and recreating the outlook account.  I'm also on a landline to make sure it wasn't an internet connection issue.  I'm currently using an imap connection in outlook.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated.  <comment350905> Wow, never faced such an issue before. Try moving to SMTP?
