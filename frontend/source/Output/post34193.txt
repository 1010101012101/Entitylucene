Where does System Preferences store the name of the Time Machine Destination <body> I am trying to create a script to determine the destination of time machine on a number of computers I manage. It shows very clearly via Time Machine Settings in System Prefs. I need to be able to find that info via command line.   <answer34196> In this link you can find the answer: https://superuser.com/questions/20887/in-what-preference-file-does-time-machine-store-the-backup-volume-name  code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code  <answer40843> The tmutil utility does exactly that, but I think it was only added in Lion.  As an added bonus, Apple doesn't document the tmutil argument you'll need, but I dug through the output of "strings /usr/bin/tmutil" and found this, which is what you're looking for:     tmutil destinationinfo   Also, "tmutil status" will tell you if a backup is currently running. It's another undocumented command.
