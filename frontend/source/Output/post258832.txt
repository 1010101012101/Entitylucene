How to turn on location services on a lost device with find my iPhone <body> I lost my iPod touch, and am using the find my iPhone app on a family members phone. I had my location services turned off before I lost it. We went through the steps in the find my iPhone, and it said that it will turn on location services when it is connected to wifi. I have a passcode on my iPod and I'm not sure it will ever be connected to wifi. Is there any other way that the location services will be turned on? Thanks in advance!  <comment323672> Nope. Besides turning on lost mode, the rest is just  waiting for the iPod to connect to wi-fi.
