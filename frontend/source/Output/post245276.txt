What's the order of USB Cables in the male connector of Apple Keyboard with n. Keypad? <body> The male connector end of my keyboard, Apple Keyboard with numerical keypad, got squeezed beyond repair.   I chopped off that bit and newly stripped the 4 leads: Red, Black, Green &amp; White/Grey.   I'd like to solder these to a new connector.   I'm wondering:  ul liIs there a "standard" for the order of USB cables globally or for Apple keyboards?/li liWhat's the right order in this product's case? /li /ul  <answer245285> USB pinouts are universal.  So, once you have the IEEE standard used, you should be able to resolder a new connector with no problem.  In this case, the USB connector used on the Apple Keyboard is a USB v1.1 connector.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXQOH.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have included the pinouts for USB 1.1/2.0 below for reference.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bcoB6.png" alt="enter image description here"  Short of that, I am sure you could use the continuity function on a multi-meter on a USB cable to figure out which pin goes where   <comment302359> Clean down the old connector to ascertain what color wire was soldered to which pinout and put then back them back the same way it was wired to begin with. <comment302418> Thanks for answering. I appreciate the reference image. Can you elaborate on using a multimeter though? How could you use it to figure out the pins? <comment302452> It would require removing the back cover of the keyboard.  In USB, it's a straight through config:  pin 1 - pin 1, pin 2 - pin 2 and so on.  [You find pin 1 on the keyboard PCB](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/66562/identifying-pin-numbers-from-pcb), and continuity test the colored wires to find pin 1.  Once you have it mapped, you can attach a new connector.
