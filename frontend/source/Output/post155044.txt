I can't 2 finger scroll using trackpad in Word since I upgraded to Yosemite <body> I can't scroll using trackpad in Word since I upgraded to Yosemite.  I'm on a MacBook Pro.  It seems fine in all other areas, just in Word.  I have to go to the sidebar and drag it up and down to scroll.  Ideas?  <answer167051> You literally need to restart your computer, that should solve the problem. It did for me :)   <comment182405> What version of Word are you using? Do you have something like BetterTouchTool installed?
