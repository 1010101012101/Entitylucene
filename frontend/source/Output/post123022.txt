How to turn WiFi on\off based on location <body> Applications such as WiFi Matic on Android allow you to turn on\off your WiFi automatically depending on location. Even though this disables assisted GPS which uses WiFi to help the GPS lock, it's still a nice battery saver trick which I loved while in the Android world.  I couldn't find any iPhone app that does the same. Does it exist?brIf not, is it because apple restricts such app control?  <answer123025> There is no public API to control the Wifi on iOS. Therefore Apple won't allow it on the AppStore.   If such an app exists then maybe on Cydia.   <answer123027> It does not exist without jailbreak, (and if it does) checking (and saving!) your location each time waste alot of battery resulting in the opposite of what you're trying to achieve.  Besides, on iOS 7 if you open strongControl Center/strong (by moving your finger from the bottom of the screen to the middle), you can stronguncheck/strong WiFi very easily. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/04XiM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer139459> Another, semi-manual solution is to create a reminder for when you leave / arrive at a particular location to enable/disable your Wi-Fi.  <answer140525> Siri: "Turn Wifi OFF"  Siri: "Turn Wifi ON"  As Siri requires a data connection, turning WiFi on will only work if you have a cellular connection.  <answer169583> As noted, only a jailbroken phone allows this capability.  As a workaround:  Use IFTTT and use the iOS location channel. Use Launch Center Pro to open the URL codeprefs:root=WIFI/code.  This will open the WiFi settings preference page.  Also have a look at this overview of iOS Settings URLs  <answer244975> I use recipes from IFTTT.com and get notifications to remind me what to do, based on my location.  A lot of restrictions on iOS, compared to android, but a location based notification is better than a reminder.  If entered  location, turn off WiFi. If left  location, turn on WiFi.  I don't need to turn off, other times, so, YMMV here on the recipes.  You need to install "IF" app from the AppStore.  <comment143814> A) Google Now checks location regularly anyway B) WiFi Matic uses cell tower ID comparison instead of GPS so it doesn't waist battery <comment143815> If you keep WiFi active on iOS, it will still try to find available WiFi networks, resulting in Battery drain/waste. <comment143816> no it does not, that can occur only if WiFi is on and WiFi Matic keeps it off unless relevant cell towers are recognized. As long as your phone is not in aireplane mode it listens to cellular tower broadcasts periodically <comment143817> Besides, when I get home I: 1) turn on WiFi 2) turn off BT 3) disable cell data transfer 4) switch to 2G as the reception in my home is really bad - so this was just a warm-up question <comment165616> I haven't run any tests, but I can guarantee you that constantly polling GPS for location data to toggle the WiFi status will use considerably more energy than just polling for WiFi networks directly. <comment192989> Would running IFFFT to run the location then notify you work?
