How to secure and/or anonimize iPad browsing? <body> I'm relatively new to Apple stuff, and especially to iOS.  I have an iPad 4 running iOS 9.3.5 and have started to load in the usual apps/programs that I use.  I have primarily used Android for mobile devices.  I noticed that Firefox for iPad does not support extensions.  On the desktop, I normally use extensions like NoScript, HttpsEverywhere, some kind of ad blocker, a password manager, and maybe a few other security/privacy/anonymity extensions.  Android supports many of the same types of technology, but maybe with different names and apps/extensions.  I've found a LifeHacker article talking about ad blocking and teir favorite also does a lot of other stuff, but seems to only work in conjunction with Safari.  Do these types of tools exist in iOS?  Do I need to jailbreak to use them?  Are these defenses even required on an iOS device?  <answer257788> These defenses are not required on an iOS device, as it is already very safe(but nothing is perfect). If you are extremely concerned about your safety, use a VPN(there are many on the app store, just make sure you are using a safe VPN). Many VPNs are free. A link to more about VPNs is https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/38176/vpns-for-beginners/.  There is an ad blocker(unfortunately doesn't work with VPNs) that I found and it blocks all ads in all apps(but it is paid). The link is https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adblock/id691121579?mt=8  If you really do desire your extensions, you would have to jailbreak because currently there are no web browsers currently with full support of extensions. There is also no current jailbreak available, but we should be able to expect one in the next few months for iOS 10, which is why I recommend updating to iOS 10. Another reason to update is that it also gets more secure each time.
