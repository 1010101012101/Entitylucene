First Aid found corruption for repair but First Aid from Recovery did not solve the issue <body> I am trying to solve this problem on my Macbook Pro 2012, running Sierra 10.12.1. I've run First Aid from Recovery and did not find any corruption, everything was fine. I've run it again from my OS and I still get the problem as follow:  precodeVerifying storage system Checking volume disk0s2: Scan for Volume Headers disk0s2: Scan for Disk Labels Logical Volume Group 04B93861-2D39-432E-A393-50AD1CE83BFE on 1 device disk0s2: Scan for Metadata Volume Logical Volume Group has a 24 MB Metadata Volume with double redundancy Start scanning metadata for a valid checkpoint Load and verify Segment Headers Load and verify Checkpoint Payload Load and verify Transaction Segment Incorporate 0 newer non-checkpoint transactions Load and verify Virtual Address Table Load and verify Segment Usage Table Load and verify Metadata Superblock Load and verify Logical Volumes B-Trees Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volume Load and verify 55E94947-EFBC-473A-A314-5EBEFF0A949A Load and verify F9FAD274-A819-4CDC-9F05-F519DA8DBED2 Load and verify Freespace Summary Load and verify Block Accounting Load and verify Live Virtual Addresses Newest transaction commit checkpoint is valid Load and verify Segment Cleaning The volume 04B93861-2D39-432E-A393-50AD1CE83BFE appears to be OK Storage system check exit code is 0.

Set up a new filesystem and then re-test the repair in recovery. If that fails - your hardware needs repair. If that succeeds with a clean check - you can set up a new account and/or restore from backup.  Live repair is not to be trusted, but live errors are of concern. I would try a verify in live mode to be sure you have issues before going to the erase / re-partition step as that can take some time so you'd rather be sure before starting down that path.  <comment333031> Hi bmike, thanks for your reply. What do you mean with "try a verify in live mode"? Thanks in advance
