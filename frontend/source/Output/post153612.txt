What does "main screen" actually refer to, in battery usage? <body> On iOS 8, there is the battery usage screen showing an estimate of the battery use, per application.  It also has an entry for "Main screen". I assumed it was just displaying the main screen with the icons, but I got 40% of that during night, during which the screen was indeed off.  As such, what does "Main screen" refer to, exactly?  <answer181315> From https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/#ios:     strongHome &amp; Lock Screen./strong This indicates that the Home screen or Lock screen   was displayed on your device. For example, the display was awakened by   pressing the Home button or by a notification.      ul   liIf an app frequently wakes your display with notifications, you can turn off push notifications for the app in Settings  Notifications.   Tap App and set Allow Notifications to Off./li   /ul   <comment180813> Did you receive notifications during night? Maybe this is why. Perhaps you could try do not disturb mode during nights.
