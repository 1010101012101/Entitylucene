Vertical lines on my 13" MacBook Pro 2015 <body> Does anyone know how to fix this issue? All of the sudden, after opening my macbook pro, i see a bunch of vertical lines in the middle of my screen. LOOKS HORRIBLE! I didn't drop the computer or anything. It just suddenly happened. I tried taking a screenshot but what I am seeing is not showing in the picture. I am thinking this is a hardware issue. BUT WHY?? The computer is not that old so I am very surprised and disappointed to see this happening. PLEASE HELP!!!!
