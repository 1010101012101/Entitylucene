AppleScript detect key press by user alternatives <body> I have searched and found that AppleScript is unable to detect key presses by the user. I would like to know is there any other alternatives to do this?  I am building a script for a specific tabs in all Internet browsers, IE, FF, Chrome, Safari.  ol liThe specific tab will be blur out, title tab, favicon, URL in address bar will be masked or replace./li liWhen the user press "tab" key for example, it will temporary remove all the things that is done in step 1 and show the original content./li liIf the user press tab again, it will go back to the state in step 1./li /ol  I have only managed to temporary make the body blur out but not the rest of step 1 and the detecting of key press.  My code:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"      set allTabs to front window's tab     repeat with eachTabs from 1 to count of allTabs         set eachTab to item eachTabs of allTabs         if URL of eachTab = "http://c10h20o.com/uniqlo/2016/0923/" then             set currentTab to eachTabs         end if     end repeat       tell front window          tell tab currentTab              execute javascript "document.body.style.filter = 'blur(0)'" --this line is working              execute javascript " --this javascript always returns me missing value              $(document).keypress(function(event){                      var keycode = (event.keyCode ? event.keyCode : event.which);                     if(keycode == '13'){                         alert('You pressed a enter key in somewhere');                         }              });                      "         end tell        end tell end tell /code/pre  I am completely new to this and it's my first time doing this.  I have asked on stack overflow but no one has replied. Hope you guys can help me out with this.  <answer294752> One way would be to use Hammerspoon to detect key presses as in this example. You could use something like this:  codehs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "alt", "ctrl"}, "I", function()   ok,result = hs.applescript('tell Application "iTunes" to artist of the current track as string')     hs.notify.new({title="Hammerspoon", informativeText=result}):send() end) /code  Pressing ⌘+⌥+ctrl+I will give you a notification with the name of the artist, in this case.
