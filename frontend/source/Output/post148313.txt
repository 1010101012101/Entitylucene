Copy progress window missing when trying to copy in Finder <body> When I copy on my iMac using Finder in OS X 10.9.5, the popup window which shows the copy process and other related information (Speed, Files left, etc.) does not appear.  How can I restore this window again?  I've not found any option in the Finder or View menu.  <comment174737> Does it show if you try to move a file? <comment174757> Does it show if you do click and hold on the finder icon in the Dock and select Show all windows
