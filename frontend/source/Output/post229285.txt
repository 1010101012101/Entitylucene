Reassociating QuickLook file associations <body> Today I noticed the QuickLook feature stopped displaying .jpg, .png, and .pdf file previews.  Desktop icons for emthese/em types don't show thumbnails.  Pressing SPACE with the file selected in Finder just shows the iconic type of file it is.  And I've tried the CNET recommended fixes:  ul licodeqlmanage -r/code/li licodeqlmanage -r cache/code/li lichecking in code/Macintosh HD/System/Library/QuickLook//code, code/Macintosh HD/Library/QuickLook//code, and code~/Library/QuickLook//code/li liremoving the files called codecom.apple.quicklook.ui.helper.plist/code, codecom.apple.quicklookconfig.plist/code, and codecom.apple.QuickLookDaemon.plist/code/li /ul  Other QuickLook file types work well.  At first, it looked like the control was taken over by Lytro:  precode2016-02-29 17:53:52.461 qlmanage[2351:64583] [qlinfinite] Instantiated plugin in host with identifier (null) 2016-02-29 17:53:52.461 qlmanage[2351:64583] [qlinfinite] Found 61 system generators 2016-02-29 17:53:52.462 qlmanage[2351:64583] [qlinfinite] Registered generator CFBundle/CFPlugIn 0x7f96e9818e00 &lt;/Applications/Lytro.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/LytroLFR.qlgenerator&gt; (bundle, loaded) for type public.jpeg /code/pre  Reinstalling the new Lytro desktop, things changed.  More disturbing was this... Dropbox seems to be taking control:  precode$ qlmanage -m plugins | grep -i public.image   public.image -&gt; /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/DropboxQL.qlgenerator (2) /code/pre  Creating a new account on my Mac shows things working fine. So it has to be something about my configuration ...except that I have no code~/Library/QuickLook/code directory, and I also do not have any code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.[Qq]uicklook*/code entries either.  At this point, multiple reboots, even with Safe Mode do not resolve the issue.  Is there a way to reset the QuickLook associations back to default?  Also, could someone post their codeqlmanage -m plugins/code output from a working system?  hr  More weird, previewing emvia the command line/em using codeqlmanage -p anyimagefile.jpg/code from the Terminal works just fine!  That said, it does emit this cryptic error:  precode2016-02-29 19:10:41.835 qlmanage[3873:130464] *** CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed 1100 (0x44c) 'Permission denied', port = 0x8f03, name = 'com.apple.coredrag' See /usr/include/servers/bootstrap_defs.h for the error codes. 2016-02-29 19:10:42.028 qlmanage[3873:130464] *** CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed 1100 (0x44c) 'Permission denied', port = 0xbb37, name = 'com.apple.tsm.portname' See /usr/include/servers/bootstrap_defs.h for the error codes. 2016-02-29 19:10:42.029 qlmanage[3873:130464] *** CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed 1100 (0x44c) 'Permission denied', port = 0xbc1b, name = 'com.apple.CFPasteboardClient' See /usr/include/servers/bootstrap_defs.h for the error codes. 2016-02-29 19:10:42.029 qlmanage[3873:130464] void __CFPasteboardSetup() : Failed to allocate communication port for com.apple.CFPasteboardClient; this is likely due to sandbox restrictions /code/pre  hr  I found a similar question that had a number of debugging techniques in it.  Performing my same command line preview with a high debug setting codeqlmanage -d 4 -p anyimagefile.jpg | grep public.image/code resulted in seeing extensions registered.  precode[DEBUG] Registering &lt;QLGenerator Image.qlgenerator&gt; for public.image [DEBUG] Registering &lt;QLGenerator /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/DropboxQL.qlgenerator&gt; for public.image /code/pre  So, I blatantly renamed the codeDropboxQL.qlgenerator/code, which curiously had a emvery recent/em modification time on it, and suddenly the preview-using-space problem went away.  Finder still does not display icon previews for these types.  (reboot.)  Now it does.  <answer229586> It appears this is a Dropbox issue.  While I had raised a question on Twitter, thanks to @szabolcs for creating a forum post, where others have chimed into.  Remove the code/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/DropboxQL.qlgenerator/code file.  @user1155120 was spot on; the beta version should be unchecked on the dropbox.com site, to prevent getting unstable updates. Download a new copy (v3.14.7 as of the time of this writing in 2016-03-02) and reinstall.  <comment279703> I'm really hesitant to point the finger at a Dropbox update; those folks really have their act together.  But it's really odd that taking their QuickLook extension out of the equation solved the problem. <comment279725> I am having the same problem.  Fingers should definitely be pointed to Dropbox.  Have you already complained to them? <comment279726> @user1155120 The DMG only has an installer that will download the actual Dropbox app (that in turn contains the QuickLook generator). <comment279727> I made a forum post: https://www.dropboxforum.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/204921503-Dropbox-3-15-51-broke-hijacked-QuickLook-on-OS-X- <comment279729> https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?build=3.14.7&plat=mac&type=full <comment279731> The DropboxQL.qlgenerator file shows up in the full installer for beta version 3.15.51  in the app Dropbox.App/Contents/Library/QuickLook/DropboxQL.qlgenerator.  You might install the stable version (3.14.7). <comment279732> https://www.dropboxforum.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/205867666-Beta-Build-3-15-51 <comment279733> You can turn off the re-upgrade to the beta version by unchecking the box in your profile on dropbox.com that says "Include me on early releases". Someone put that item back in user profiles to allow going back to 3.14.7.
