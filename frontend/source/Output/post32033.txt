How to remove non-essential files from Leopard <body> I am cleaning up a really old mac to bring it back to use. It has an 80 gig hard drive and after wiping out downloads, documents, pictures, music, videos and unneccesary applications I am now stranded at about 48 gigs. I read that Leopard needs about 9 gigs, how do I get rid of the remaining 20 gb without reinstalling. Its been three and half years since I bought it and I could only find Part 2 of the recovery disk. (I have already gotten rid of iLife, iTunes, iWorks, Web Browsers, Printer Drivers etc as I need only terminal based facilities such as lynx and vi.) If anyone could point me to solutions for freeing up as much space as I can it'd be very helpful.   <answer32034> You can use Monolingual to trim the locales you don't require. This should trim at least a couple of GB.  The printer drivers are located in code/Library/Printers/code. You can delete everything within the codePrinters/code directory (note, do not touch the code/System/Library/Printers//code directory).  Additionally, if it's a default install, it may have come with iLife. GarageBand loops also take up a few GB and are located in code/Library/Application Support/Garageband/Apple Loops//code.  There are other areas you can trim space, but those will net the biggest gains. You can also give programs like DaisyDisk a shot (or free equivalent). They'll show you how data is distributed on your hard drive, and allow you to further pinpoint cruft that can be removed.  <comment36722> thanks.. I got rid of the printer drivers.. I will try monolingual now. <comment36727> @yayu No problem. I've edited my answer to include GarageBand loops, which take up a massive amount of space if you have iLife installed. <comment36728> Thanks for the pointers .. I have freed up about 10 gb more. There's still some 10 gb lying somewhere... would trying to find it among the system files be worth the risk? <comment36730> @yayu Give DaisyDisk (or equivalent) a try. Anything under /System is required. You can remove some things, but typically it won't affect hard disk space that dramatically. Most of the big ticket items are under /Library or your user (or /Applications). <comment36781> @yayu also check out how to [remove built-in speech synthesis voices](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30697/how-can-i-delete-some-of-the-builtin-texttospeech-voices/31732#31732)!
