how to run open -n applicaton name from command line? <body> I got these two lines that I want to run from a script file (on Yosemite 10.10.3). It works when running from terminal  precodeCX_LICENSE=LS open -n /Applications/Inspire\ Designer\ 10.0\ GA/Inspire\ Designer.app/ /code/pre  I saved these two lines in a file and named it run ID. -rwxr-xr-x@  1 Administrator  staff         89 20 Jul 17:34 runID  If I double click runID then I get new window with  precodeLast login: Mon Jul 20 17:22:27 on ttys002 dsa-mac1:~ Administrator$ /Users/Administrator/Desktop/runID ; exit; : command not foundr/Desktop/runID: line 1:  /Users/Administrator/Desktop/runID: line 1: -n: command not found logout  [Process completed] /code/pre  any idea how to make runID work?  <answer196635> You're missing the initial line of your script file - the "shebang".  Put the following in your script file:  pre #!/bin/sh CX_LICENSE=LS open -n /Applications/Inspire\ Designer\ 10.0\ GA/Inspire\ Designer.app/ /pre  That should work - the file you had before did not have enough information to tell the operating system emhow/em to run your script. You want to run a set of shell commands, so you need to tell the operating system it's a shell script, which is done by including the code#!/bin/sh/code as the first line of the script.  See this answer on Stack Overflow for more information.  strongUpdate/strong  Just to confirm, I've just tested this script and it works fine:  precode#!/bin/sh open -n /Custom\ Applications/MacVim.app /code/pre  As correctly pointed out by @fd0, you should name the script code&lt;script&gt;.tool/code or code&lt;script&gt;.command/code for it to be executed from Finder (where code&lt;script&gt;/code is a meaningful name for the script).  <comment234913> yes, it's correct. Copied from terminal. <comment234918> I used standard text editor. Cannot remember its name right now. <comment234920> I am not able to do that right now. I was doing remote session and trying to solve an issue. I'll ask someone to issue and see. Thank you for your help. <comment234923> I think I tried that already. Let me confirm tomorrow. <comment235084> Yep, I tried before posting this question. Getting this "dsa-mac1:Desktop Administrator$ ./runID  ./runID: line 2: -n: command not found" <comment235135> The error message doesn't seem to match your code sample (-n is on line 2), but this may be the result of having Windows-stil end of lines. Can you use `nano` as an editor, write the script there and try again? <comment235136> Also, to use a specific application, you'll need the `-a` option like `open -n -a "Inspire Designer.app"`. <comment235301> I used OSX native editor to create and edit the script. I think it's called TextEdit. Unfortunatelly I am not able to access this OSX computer anymore :-( Why do I have to use `-a` option as the command line version works fine? <comment235482> I've just tested using a similar script and it works a charm - see my updated answer. <comment235488> @mjturner - Shell scripts aren't meant to be double clickable unless suffixed with `.command` or `.tool`. In either case the text files do not need a shebang. The script runs within an instance of the user's shell. <comment235493> @fd0 Yes, so I've realised (and thanks for the `.command`/`.tool` tip). Also, I neglected to test using Finder :(
