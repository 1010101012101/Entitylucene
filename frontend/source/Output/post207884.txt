Cannot set VLC as default through Get Info <body> I cannot set VLC as default.   I know about right-click â†’ 'Get Info' but there is no drop-down to change the default so it's not possible to change it. I'm not sure why this is but I know from searching around that I'm not alone.  <answer207885> Choose a file in your Finder, left click on :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aiEie.png" alt="enter image description here"  Choose VLC app and check the 'always open with' box  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HwtPr.png" alt="enter image description here"
