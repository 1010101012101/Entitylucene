Menu with categories like MATE/Cinnamon Desktop Enviroment <body> I have a question about menu with categories.  You can see this menu here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8rEK.png" alt="http://linux.inf.ua/mint.png"  Does OS X Mountain Lion support somekind of this menu?  <answer105904> While it does not pop UP from the bottom of the screen (rather it sits in the menu bar, top-right side of the screen) XMenu works VERY well:  http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/freeware.html  (scroll down to the bottom of that screen to find the download link)  It's freeware and has been working great for me for a few years. It is completely customizable, quick and uses few system resources.  <comment124444> Are you simply looking for a "start menu" type UI for OS X or are you looking to run an entirely different interface instead of Finder? Good use of a picture, BTW - that helps narrow down what you seek immensely. <comment124471> @bmike I want see menu with categories like on this picture :) this feature will be very useful:) only menu with categories, not another desktop enviroment <comment124516> The place of menu is unnecessary. I mean that I want categories for applications in menu like on picture that I added to post. Thank you for Xmenu, I will try it!
