Blur Interfaces of TeXworks on MacBook Pro with Retina Display？ <body> I am using TeXworks as the LaTeX editor on my new MacBook Pro with Retina Display.  The interfaces are super blur. It seems that TeXworks does not support the retina resolution. See below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jn5Bw.png" alt="enter image description here"  The MacTeX.pkg was downloaded from MacTeX TUG today. Hence, I think it is the latest version.  How may I fix it?  <answer114897> h3You can use strongRetinizer/strong:/h3     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KlPBI.png" width="200"      strongRetinizer/strong is a small app I wrote that strongallows apps that aren’t retina/strong ready and are displayed pixelated at 1x strongto display/strong their UI widgets strongat 2x/strong. That way, only their custom images will look bad and not the whole app.   Tested, and works great:  Before: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Doab.png" alt="@1x"  After: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dfJ74.png" alt="@2x"  <answer115886> You can also use TexShop, which also comes in the bundle. It looks quite good on a retina display and is quite similar to TexWorks otherwise:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rAAhL.png" alt="TexShop screenshot"
