Relentless message "macOS Updates Installed" ever since last OS update <body> Since my last OS update after every restart the following message pops up:     macOS Updates Installed.br   Your computer restarted to install these updates.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sXqq3.png" alt="macOS Updates Installed popup"  How can I get rid of it?  <comment350972> ask the second question as a separate question <comment350978> What happens when you click the 'Details' button? <comment350983> @IconDaemon: I've just restarted my computer in order to answer your question, and guess what? The message did not pop up! Maybe it's fixed itself spontaneously. I hope it's not a fluke.
