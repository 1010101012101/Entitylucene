Automator Service shortcut won't work <body> I had this Automator Service shortcut working in 10.10 ("Yosemite") but here in 10.11.6, for some reason it has stopped working.  In my Automator workflow, I have 1 action, "Run Shell Script."  The shell is /bin/bash; the command line is:  precode/usr/local/bin/lockscreen /code/pre  (compiled Obj C software I wrote to immediately lock the screen)  I go into System Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts-Services, and I see my workflow.  It is checked, and I gave it a keyboard shortcut.  If I run this application from the Terminal command line manually, it functions perfectly. However, if I use the kb shortcut, all I get is a system beep.  I have tried several kb shortcut combos, but still always only get the beep, and no locking of the screen.  So, why is this not working?  How can I troubleshoot?  <comment341664> I encountered the same problem as you. What I find is that if you visit the Services menu in the active app first, the shortcut will work correctly. For example, if you set the service active for Finder, go to **Finder  Services** (just so that the menu pop ups) and it works. But that shortcut won't work in Safari. You have to go to **Safari  Services** to activate it first <comment341665> BTW, if you simply want to lock the screen, `pmset displaysleepnow` also does the trick nicely <comment341706> @CodeDifferent Just figured it out! I had my service configured to accept Text as input, but it should have been set to No Input. Then had to rename so OS X reconfigured to move to the General section under Services. Problem solved.
