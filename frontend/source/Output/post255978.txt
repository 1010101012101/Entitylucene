How to make brew install a package only if it is not yet installed, and upgrade otherwise? <body> I found it surprisingly hard to make codebrew/code either install a package (if it is missing) or upgrade it (if it is already installed). Is there no simple command / arguments to do that? Based on this answer, I ended up doing this:  precodebrew ls --versions git &amp;&amp; brew upgrade git || brew install git /code/pre  after doing a codebrew update/code, obviously.
