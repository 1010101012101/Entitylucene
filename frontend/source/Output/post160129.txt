Does Facebook have Ads now? <body> Does Facebook have Ads now?  Or does my codeSafari/code have a virus?   Has anyone experienced a codeTwitter/code Ad on their codeFacebook/code?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hLiEo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer160130> I've always had ads on Facebook. The content of your ads depends on what websites you recently visited on the Internet. For example, after I searched for some used motherboards, I started seeing ads of motherboard on Facebook.  You may be able to change this by going though your security and advertisement settings on Facebook.  emEdit:/em Here's a link to the Facebook Ads settings page.  <comment188249> Ohh wow. I didn't know that. Thanks. I will go check on that now. <comment188252> @evoque2015 Here's a link to one of the settings pages: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads <comment188265> You've previously never seen an Ad on facebook? Facebook must be doing the Ad placements totally wrong. <comment188278> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about Facebook functionality and not Apple in any way.
