Change the behaviour of Enter key in iMessage <body> I keep sending iMessages from my mac before I have finished typing them by accidentally hitting the return key.  Is there a way to change the behaviour to send on Cmd-Enter instead?  <answer194819> I think its not possible to change behavior of Cmd-Enter Key you can use ALT + Enter/Return keys to create a New Line/paragraph in a text chat.  <answer194831> kbdShift/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd creates a new line for Spanish layouts.  <answer261818> To override the default Enter behaviour I used the instructions posted in the question here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/236255/135255  <comment232489> I don't think there's a way of changing this behavior, but if you want to insert a line break in your message, you can use `control`+`Enter` or `alt (option)`+`Enter`. <comment232505> Thanks for the suggestions, I am aware that you can enter a new line with Alt-Enter, I'm just clumsy (UK layout has large enter key very close to backspace) and don't like that it sends so easily.
