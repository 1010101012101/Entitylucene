Mountain Lion screen crashes after returning from sleep <body> During the past 3 days I have experienced the following issue: when returning from sleep, I see an extremely garbled version of my desktop. The only thing that seems to help is a reboot.  My first guess is that this is related to the video card. After looking into this issue, I found a lot of problems related to ML and returning from sleep, such as this post on AskDifferent: How to stop MacBook Pro (Retina) from freezing/locking at the login/authentication dialogue, after wake? but I think this is a different issue because it does not speak of a garbled screen.  strongSome more details:/strong  ul liSystem: MacBook Pro 15" early 2011, 2,2GHZ I7, 8GB Ram, AMD Radeon HD6750M 1024/li liThe issue seems to happen only when I open my laptop in the morning; if I close and open my laptop during the day, it does not seem to happen./li liThe issue 'solves' when rebooting. /li /ul  strongPhoto of how this looks:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oj0oP.png" alt="Photograph of a 2011 MacBook Pro with a garbled screen"  <comment89573> This also occurs on my MBP 15" with Intel HD Graphics 3000. Usually after having used external screen at the office. <comment89584> @user38162 I have detected a pattern involving external monitors as well. If I connect my laptop to my external monitor *before* the laptop screen is turned on, this usually happens. If I wait for the laptop screen to turn on, and *then* connect my external monitor, the problem does not occur.
