Enable 2FA For Non-Primary Apple ID <body> It seems the only way to enable two factor authentication on an Apple ID is by using an Apple device.   I can log into my non-primary Apple ID on the appleid.apple.com website but the instructions for enabling 2FA require that I enable it on an apple device. But this would mean I would need to remove my existing primary Apple ID first and set the Non-Primary to be the primary.  How can I enable 2FA for my Apple ID that is not the primary ID via the website?
