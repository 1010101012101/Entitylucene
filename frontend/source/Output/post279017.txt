iPhone 4 won't connect to Internet <body> I just recently purchased a used iPhone 4. I can send texts/make calls and connect to wifi but for some reason I only get 3G/1X and whenever I get on Safari without WiFi I am told that it "could not activate cellular data network" I'm on a data plan so this shouldn't be a problem. We reset network settings and cleared all data on safari but still have the same problem.Even did a factory reset at the phone store and still didn't fix it. What would you all recommend trying next?  <comment351183> It is on the most recent update for iphone 4, 7.1.2
