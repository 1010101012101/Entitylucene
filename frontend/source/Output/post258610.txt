Slow on SSD and cannot reinstall to SSD <body> so i've been using Kingston HyperX SSD for about 2 years (i think, idk).  suddenly my mbp become laggy, it lags everytime i click or hover on something.  i tried to boot from a spare HDD, and it worked fine. i formated my SSD and tried to install Sierra, but the installation is so slow, spent around 4 hours and it still under 25%.  i installed ubuntu on the same ssd, and it running well (quite fast, actually)  any idea why ? should i change my ssd ?  thanks!  <comment323420> Your SSD might be failing. The sectors on the OS X partition at be bad.
