How can I get Apple Mail to paginate instead of loading all conversations? <body> Right now every single GMail message I have ever received (quite a lot) are sitting in my inbox, but ideally I would not have them all just sitting there, and instead maybe paginate by 20. Is this possible?  <comment113995> You don't have to have all your Gmail on your computer. It can live perfectly well on the web ... <comment114312> @Zo219 how so? It downloads them all :-/ <comment114505> I use POP for Gmail, works perfectly well in Mountain Lion. Maybe me, but I couldn't find a way to not download huge numbers of mails in IMAP. Maybe someone can jump in here ... <comment114511> See this post for details on setting up POP mail in Lion and Mountain Lion. https://discussions.apple.com/message/16090931#16090931
