First, open the Terminal app. You can find it in Launchpad or by using Spotlight. Next, stop the process using codesudo launchctl stop com.apple.mrt/code.  Then, remove the components, using the following (or manually remove them in Finder):  precodesudo rm /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mrt.plist sudo rm /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.mrt.uiagent.plist sudo rm /System/Library/CoreServices/MRTAgent.app sudo rm /usr/libexec/MRT /code/pre  Finally, reboot your machine. codecom.apple.mrt/code should no longer launch on startup (or at all).  strongNotes:/strong  ul liYou may need to enter an administrator's user and password.br/li liApple may release updates which re-add codecom.apple.mrt/code to your machine.br/li /ul  <answer296305> I have MacOS Sierra 10.12.6  MRT runtime files are not easy deleted.  ol listep (Run recovery mode):br 1.1 restart your macbr 1.2 press cmd+r on loadbr 1.3 recovery mode opened  /li liUse Terminal un utilites menubr 2.1. try command codecsrutil disabled/code (google about csrutil)br 2.2. if you see message "command not found" go to nex stepbr 2.3. using filesystem delete these files code /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mrt.plist /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.mrt.uiagent.plist /System/Library/CoreServices/MRTAgent.app /System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app /usr/libexec/MRT /code/li /ol  I input such commands:br  codecd "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/System/Library/LaunchDaemons"/codebr  coderm ./com.apple.mrt.plist/code  Important: Macintosh HD - your general bootable disk.  2.4.
