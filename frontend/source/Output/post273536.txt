Macbook Retina 2012 pro heating up with dual monitor <body> I have a mbp 15 inch 2012 retina and I am facing trouble with heat.  When I connect it to a 24 inch FHD monitor and keep the lip open so use both screen it starts heating up quite a bit easily hits strong55C (130F)/strong under very light usage e.g. web browsing, it can goes higher if I do anything more demanding.  If I, close lid so use only the external monitor then the temperature drops to about strong40C (104F) under the same load./strong  I am trying to work out how to use my laptop at my desk with an external monitor without it heating up so much.   Has anyone experience similar thing and how did you solve it?   Thanks.   <comment343907> Well the dedicated GPU has to push more than twice the pixels. The temperature increase sounds to be within range if you ask me.
