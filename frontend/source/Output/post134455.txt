Changing terminal colors for normal files when ls -G or within .bash_profile <body> So I followed this thread (Changing terminal color) and got all of the colors working for directories and such, except however, for normal files such as a Gemfile or .txt files or .java files or .rb files etc... I was wondering how I can get normal files to show up in color, even better if I can get different extensions of the file to show up in different colors as well. Let me know if you guys have any resources for this.  <answer153673> I don't think colorizing the file names of regular files is possible with codels/code alone (emi.e./em without postprocessing the output with another script):  ol liThe manual page for codels/code (shown when you type codeman ls/code) does not mention this possibility./li liI would expect that the codels/code coming with Mac OS X is very similar to the BSD version of codels/code, since there seems to be little motivation for Apple to make changes in this area.  The source code for BSD's codels/code is available online, eme.g./em the FreeBSD version is on GitHub.  The function which selects the color for a file name is codecolortype()/code in the source file codebin/ls/print.c/code.  And checking the source code it is clear that at least the BSD version of codels/code does not have the ability to change color when printing the names of a regular file./li /ol  <comment159121> [This is a nice guide](http://osxdaily.com/2013/02/05/improve-terminal-appearance-mac-os-x/), though I'm not sure as to whether it changes file as well as directory color (screenshot only shows top level traverse). <comment159126> That was very helpful thanks!
