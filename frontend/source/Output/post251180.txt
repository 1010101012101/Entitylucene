Reduce opacity of existing image <body> Can Apple's Preview app be used to reduce the opacity of an existing image?   I might be asking this wrong. To be clear, I've Googled it extensively but Google seems to think what I want is to remove a solid background from around my image, for example making a the black background/backdrop transparent in an image that's of a car. However, my background is already transparent and what I want is for the car to be at about 90% Opacity.  <answer251184> codePreview/code can't do this.  codeImageMagick/code can, and nearly anything you can imagine.  You can easily install it with codeMacPorts/code (see MacPorts Home):  precodeport install imagemagick /code/pre  Let's say your original image is codeporsche-911.png/code: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONgkt.png" alt="Porsche 911"  Enter in codeTerminal/code the following command:  precodeconvert porsche-911.png -alpha set -channel A -evaluate set 50% porsche-911-50%.png /code/pre  which will compute from your original input codeporsche-911.png/code the output codeporsche-911-50%.png/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FxMIC.png" alt="Porsche 911 50% transparent"  If you want to learn more about this great free tool, read:  ImageMagick home.  <comment312145> Which car? We can't see your picture. <comment312151> The transparent one.
