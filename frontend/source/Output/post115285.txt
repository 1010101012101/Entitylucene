Windows 8.1 on bootcamp not hibernating <body> I am running windows 8.1 on macbook pro retina.  When i trying to hibernate it is giving me an error codeA device attached to the system is not functioning.(31)/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKvLF.jpg" alt="A device attached to the system is not functioning.(31)"  Any thoughts what it could be related to?   BTW do not have any devices plugged to any port.  <answer115292> If there is any device plugged into a Thunderbolt port on the computer while in Bootcamp Windows will not be able to sleep or I presume manfully hibernate.  An article from MacWindows.com explains why: http://www.macwindows.com/Thunderbolt-Limitations-of-Mac-running-Windows-and-getting-around-them.html  <answer115337> Ok after exploring and gooogling more about the issue I find out that it is some kind of driver failure issue.  I used Driver Verifier to check for driver failure by running the command command codevirifier /standard /all/code - it will verify all the drivers in the system on startup and requires restart.  After restart I've got the blue screen of death saying that I've got codeIRQ_LESS_OR_EQUAL/code error and after that my Windows won't to boot at all... BTW, the great article about codeIRQ_LESS_OR_EQUAL/code is here  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/drJMY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  After a few failures windows give me an recovery options. So I chosen codecommand promt/code to edit codevirifier/code options.  I was trying to switch codevirifier /bootmodes/code(Verifier Command Syntax) to codedisableafterfail/code and to codeoneboot/code but none of them worked, I've got same codeblue screen of death/code saying about codeIRQ_LESS_OR_EQUAL/code error each time.  A have a few options to try but I decided to use codesystem restore/code first. So it worked.  After I boot the Windows I find out that codehibernation/code is codeworking now/code! but codetouchpad double-pinch click/code is stopped working for some reason. So I did try to install codeBootCampDriversFolder\Drivers\Apple\AppleMultiTouchTrackPadInstaller64.exe/code but it won't help. So I did run bootcamp drivers codesetup.exe/code and choose coderepair option/code from there. It reinstall the drivers and after restart all working so far, including codehibernation/code!  Hope it will help any one else experiencing same problem.  <comment135008> No devices plugged at all
