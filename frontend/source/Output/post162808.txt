Automator: Find Reminders by list? <body> I would like to retrieve all the Reminders in a specific reminders list with Automator. Searching for reminder, the available actions are “emDelete Reminders/em”, “emNew Reminders Items/em”, “Filter Calendar Items“ and “Find Calendar Items”.   emFind Calendar Items/em allows you to search for reminders, but the search parameters available are   ul liTitle/li liNotes/li liPriority/li liCompleted/li liURL/li liDate Due/li liDate last modified/li liDate completed/li liReminder has (alarms)/li liReminder has no (alarms)/li /ul  The “Reminder has (no)” query is fixed on alarms, no other options are given.  strongIs there any way to get all the Reminders from a given list?/strong  I’m running Yosemite and Automator 2.5.  <answer162809> I have found a workaround. In that list, let’s call it Downloads, I have put the word “downloads” in every reminder item. Like so:  h3Downloads/h3  ul liDownload http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/24/#javascript-automation/li liDownload https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard//li /ul  Redundant and not too pretty, but it works.  The way I accomplished this was the following actions:  ol listrongFind Calendar Items/strong ol liFind emReminders/em where/li liemAll/em of the following are true/li liemAny content/em contains emcodelist_name/code/em/li /ol/li listrongEvent Summary/strong/li li…Now you can run other actions like “Extract URLs from Text“/li /ol  Then you’re done.  hr  One thing I have learned is that (so far) there is no way to retrieve the contents of a list from Reminders. These actions will grab any item that has the text of the list name. It won’t grab that list (or all the contents) even though the list has the stirng I am searching for. It makes sense but it is lacking a bit.   <comment242895> grab all reminders that have a date last updated greater than some time in the distant past.
