Buying a Slitherine In-App on an Ipad Mini should be free if bought for the Ipad. Same appleid, same IOS <body> Why does an In-App purchase on an Ipad Mini for a Slitherine game, Battle Academy, asks for money even though it was previously paid for on the Ipad. Same appleid. Same IOS (7.0.4). Have queried Slitherine who say its an Apple Store 'message'. I have successfully downloaded to the Ipad-mini (mIPAD)for 'free', several apps - different developers - having previously bought the app on the IPAD.  Are In-Apps different to Apps? should they be free to the second IPAD if they have previously been paid for?  <comment138693> It depends, some in app purchase are used instantly (say if you buy 1000 fake coins) and others are able to be re-downloaded again and again on the same or different devices. Are you aware of how to get app support from the developer in case it's not clear? <comment138755> You might have to contact the developer of that App. but usually you will see an option somewhere in the App's settings for restoring purchased items.
