Is it possible to have a playback indicator in OSX menubar? <body> On my iPhone, until iOS 6, anytime music is playing a play symbol appears (and disappears when no music is playing).   How can I achieve a similar effect in the menu bar of OSX Mountain Lion?  <answer77664> Here is sample code for doing this in Cocoa (you can paste it in a new XCode project and build it) :   AppDelegate.h :  precode    NSStatusItem* statusItem; /code/pre  AppDelegate.m :  precode- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification {     [[NSDistributedNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self                                                         selector:@selector(iTunesNotification:)                                                             name:@"com.apple.iTunes.playerInfo"                                                           object:nil]; //registering for notifications from iTunes      [NSApp setActivationPolicy:NSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibited]; //No icon in the dock, menubar only      statusItem = [[NSStatusBar systemStatusBar] statusItemWithLength:NSVariableStatusItemLength]; // For the icon in the status bar }  - (void) iTunesNotification:(NSNotification *)note {     NSDictionary *information = [note userInfo];     NSString* state = [information objectForKey:@"Player State"];      if([state isEqualToString:@"Paused"]) {         //hiding the indicator         [statusItem setTitle:@""];     } else if ([state isEqualToString:@"Playing"]) {         //showing the indicator         [statusItem setTitle:@"â–¶"];     } } /code/pre  The only flaw i could see in this sample is i'm using a character for the play icon and not a image. It could be a problem when the encoding messes something up.   <answer77665> You could look at some of the menu bar apps that control iTunes for you. Some of those may have a nice interface for that. Here are a few http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/music-roundups/five-slick-menu-bar-apps-for-controlling-itunes/  <comment89988> Maybe a simple Cocoa App ? <comment89989> @MatthieuRiegler, That's what I'm thinking. Hopefully something lightweight that doesn't do much/if any more then the play indicator. <comment89995> For a cocoa app. It's less than 20 lines. I'll post an sample code <comment89998> Bytecontroller is a good lightweight menu bar app http://awil.no/bytecontroller <comment89999> Wow. This is terrific! Thank you very much for writing this up. I put it into XCode, packaged it as an app, and am using it as of writing. I even set it to start automatically when I log in. Does exactly what I want. Thanks. Truly awesome!
