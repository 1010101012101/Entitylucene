Yara in terminal <body> I am quite new to mac and I came across something that I think is unusual (After researching the web). When I open the terminal application, I get a "Yara:" string before the command prompt... Is it something bad? How can I get rid of this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GJkwN.png" alt="Image description"  <answer129310> The default Terminal PS1 is:  precodecomputername:directory user$ /code/pre  Therefore, codeYara/code is your computer's name.  <comment151335> No it is not... I looked in the config just to be sure but it seems it is "Bismuth" (Wich is the name I gave it) I added a screen shot of the problem. <comment151336> @Philibobby What does running `hostname` show? <comment151337> Oh I think it is because I am connected to a specific wifi... Is it possible that it changes my hostname? When I type hostname I get yara.specificdomain.ca <comment151341> Please type `echo $PS1` and include this information in your question.  The command prompt string can be set by anything, this will show us where the text is coming from. <comment151343> Your DHCP system/settings may be set to assign a client ID to your machine upon connection. <comment151347> Great thanks for the answers. I was scared a bit at first that it might be a virus of some sort!
