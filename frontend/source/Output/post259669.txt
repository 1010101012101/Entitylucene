Missing Macintosh HD partition <body> I have a MacBook Pro 15" Early 2013 with OS X Yosemite. While I was using a program (Screen Flow) non upgraded for Yosemite, my computer got stuck and after a while I decided to turn off the computer pressing and holding the power button.   Now, when I restart a flashing folder with a question mark appears. I tried to reset SMC and NVRAM but did not work and I cannot start in single-user mode or verbose mode. When I start my Mac from an external drive, a message appears telling if I want initialize, ignore or eject my internal SSD and Disk Utility can show it but it says that it is not formatted and I can't see any volume.   Also typing "diskutil list /dev/disk0" in Terminal I cannot see any partition.   pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codebash-3.2# diskutil list  /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                                                   *500.3 GB   disk0 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3 bash-3.2# gpt -r show /dev/disk0 gpt show: unable to open device '/dev/disk0': Input/output error  bash-3.2# /code/pre  I tried to use TestDisk to recover my partition following the step by step tutorial but it was not successful. I know that my data are still there because I can recover them with several Data Recovery programs like Disk Drill but they are not perfect like they were originally.   I would like to ask if is there any way to restore my partition or I have to give up and consider my SSD ended?  Update.

Typing your code sudo gpt -r show disk0 I get the same output <comment325287> @klanomath I read your answer for the question: missing Mac partition - unrecognized file system, something like that would work for me in your opinion? Thanks <comment325295> @IacopoDeAngelis No that wouldn't work. I think the connection to the ssd is faulty. You probably have to repair it.  Your SSD probably isn't affected. <comment325453> @klanomath I'm sorry but I don't understand what you mean for "the connection to the ssd". If I'm not wrong the ssd is directly connected to the logic board so you think the problem is a bad logic board? I already did specific hardware tests. In particular the storage diagnostic and the VST diagnostic did not work but the technician explained me that probably it was because of the lack of any partition on the disk. <comment325454> @IacopoDeAngelis I meant a faulty soldering point of the SSD or a faulty trace on the mainboard. <comment325457> All of your partitions are gone, for an unknown reason.  Try issuing the command `diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk0`
