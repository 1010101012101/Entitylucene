Bluetooth Menu Shows Garbage <body> When opening the Bluetooth menu on Macmini6,2 with OS X 10.10.4, it shows a big load of bogus discovered devices. I reset the System's Bluetooth Preferences, but no change.  Why is this? What can I do against it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TGXLQ.png" alt="Bluetooth menu"  <comment234337> If you take the MacMini to another location, do you see the same list of devices? <comment234340> Yes. Also, various other devices don't see them. Besides, the OUIs are bogus. <comment234341> Sounds like a hardware issue. <comment234344> I don't think so. They don't appear on Bluetooth pref pane, only in the menu. <comment234353> What is "Brett" ? <comment234359> My Tragic Macpad.
