imac: keyboard stuck on caps lock <body> From time to time the (Apple USB) keyboard of my imac (21.5-inch, Mid 2010, mac os 10.12.5) gets stuck on caps lock (namely all letters are printed capital, and I can't turn capital off), and I have to unplug the USB cable to fix this; when I plug it back, the light is on, and I can turn caps lock off. This happens more frequently after installing mac os updates, then it gradually becomes less frequent.  Are there an explanation and a solution for this issue?  <comment358351> More than likely, you need a new keyboard.  Try it with a different keyboard (even a PC keyboard will work).  If the problem goes away, you have your answer. <comment358355> @Allan thanks, will try that.
