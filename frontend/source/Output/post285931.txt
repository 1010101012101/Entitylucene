How can I download macOS High Sierra's full installation file? <body> I've installed the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility (.pkg file) from Apple Developer's official website. Upon completing installation, it opens the Mac App Store to the macOS High Sierra installation page automatically.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jreG4.jpg" alt="Image 1"   Under the 'Information' section, it's stated that the size of the installation file is 4.90 GB.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eITX4.png" alt="Image 2"   However, when I downloaded it, it didn't download the full installation file. Instead, it's only 7.8 MB large.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/77YaY.png" alt="Image 3"   The installation file looks the same as a usual one.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iYGEg.png" alt="Image 4"   h1So,/h1  ul liWhy are some users getting the 4.90 GB file while others are getting the 7.8 MB file?/li liIs there any way to get the full 4.90 GB installation file?/li /ul  Fyi, my Mac is currently running on macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (16D32).  h1Update/h1  I appreciate the two answers that I've received and both can be reproduced. However, I'm not sure on why are some users getting the 4.90 GB file while others are getting the 7.8 MB file.  This thread from MacRumours suggests that it's something to do with the amount of disk space available on the Mac.  <answer285942> Your downloaded file seems to be corrupted or downloaded incompletely. So, download it again see what'll happen, with opening this in Safari: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mpo1M.png" alt="enter image description here" macappstores://itunes.apple.com/app/id1209167288  I downloaded it and it's 5.26 GB, although it downloaded about 4.9 GB as App Store mentions (I think download file is compressed).  Again, I mention you that a few times I stopped the downloading with removing the installation app from launchpad and again I resume the downloading without any problems and it continues with the size that downloaded before.  <answer285970> First you need to install High Sierra and then boot it. strongIn High Sierra/strong, open Safari and then open this URL to download the installer again:  macappstores://itunes.apple.com/app/id1209167288  emOnly when downloading from within High Sierra I get an installer that contains the installation files/em, when I download it in Sierra, my installer is also just about 8 MB, the installation files are downloaded only on install (no idea where the system is storing them during installation).  BTW, if you want an installer medium, create a writable DMG with codeDisk Utility/code (6 GB of space is sufficient, make sure File System is MacOS Extended, strongnot AFP/strong, leave all other values default), quit codeDisk Utility/code (otherwise it will prevent certain kind of write access to that new volume), open codeTerminal/code app to get a terminal window and then run:  precodesudo "/Applications/Install macOS 10.13 Beta.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia"  --applicationpath "/Applications/Install macOS 10.13\ Beta.app" --volume "/Volumes/Untitled" /code/pre  when prompted, enter your admin password. Here is the command again, just broken down for readability:  precodeINSTALLER="/Applications/Install macOS 10.13 Beta.app" sudo                                          \     "$INSTALLER/Resources/createinstallmedia" \     --applicationpath "$INSTALLER"            \     --volume "/Volumes/Untitled" /code/pre  Will take a while. Finally open codeDisk Utility/code again, select codeImages &gt; Convert.../code, pick your disk image, choose a name and select codeImage Format/code to be codeCD/DVD Master/code. After the convert you have a disk image you can burn to get a real installer DVD that is also bootable.  <answer288433> For what it's worth: I have encountered a similar issue: a very small download file (14,5 MB), that launched automatically after a few seconds... tried it twice (both times the installation failed giving me some error about corrupted information on the server - I'm not sure what it meant but it might have been related to the fact that I was logged onto the MAS with a different account than the one I signed up for the public beta with). Anyway I just retried again and just on a whim before clicking download I pressed alt on the keyboard... now it's downloading the full thing. This all happened in the space of 10 minutes.  <answer295200> Download codemacOSDeveloperBetaAccessUtility.dmg/code. Then, in a VM try installing 10.13. After you agree to the Terms &amp; Conditions let it download.  strongDo not click restart./strong You will have the Installer in your code/macOS\ Install\ Data//code directory.  <comment360725> Thanks for your answer! I've downloaded a few times but it still seems to be 7.8 MB. I'll think I'll restart my computer and try again later. <comment360754> Sorry, but what you say is just not true. The installer app itself is in fact just 7.8 MB. No idea what you downloaded, but I can reproduce that on several systems with several different accounts. Only when running the installer (which I did, **installed just fine!**), the rest of the system is downloaded, I just don't know where. Please add an image to your reply showing how that installer app is 5.26 GB on your system. I'm sorry, but in your case I have to say "pic or it didn't happen". Oh, and please, a pic from 10.12! <comment360761> @Mecki Actually, I did come across the 5.26 GB file in some YouTube videos, so I think it does exist. Just that I'm not sure why my Macs aren't getting it. Just curious, are all your systems running the latest version of Sierra? <comment360762> @Panda Yes, it does, see my reply. It exists when you download the installer within High Sierra, but I've not seen anyone getting it when downloading the installer in Sierra (and a lot of people I know have tried it already) <comment360763> Thanks for the comprehensive answer! That's quite interesting and differs from past developer previews :) <comment360792> @Panda Okay, I took screenshot and upload it. Take a loot at it. I don't know why your download files are different. <comment360794> @Mecki I upload a screenshot. <comment360795> @Mewtei Thanks! That seems weird, I can't get the 5.26 GB file on my Mac, are you running on Sierra? <comment360796> Apparently, it's something to do with the disk space left on the Mac - [MacRumors thread](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-high-sierra-10-13-unsupported-macs-thread.2048478/) <comment360797> @Panda When I downloaded the installer in Sierra and just got the 8 MB installer, I had over 800 GB of free disk space. When I downloaded the installer in High Sierra I just had about 150 GB of disk space (as I just created a smaller sub partition to install High Sierra), so unless it's an issue with "too much free disk space", I somehow doubt it :-P <comment360798> Wow, apparently it's not that either. I do see some users getting the 7.8 MB file while others got the larger one on Sierra, not sure why though. Really weird :D <comment360840> @Panda No problem, yeah, I've Sierra. It might be a bug or something :-??
