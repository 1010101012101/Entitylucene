Screen goes black every few minutes in my Mac mini 2014 <body> I've got a Mac Mini 2014 with a 250GB flash storage using El Capitan.  It's connected to a monitor using the HDMI output, with a HDMI to DVI cable to the DVI input in the monitor.  The screen goes black for a couple of seconds ever few minutes.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wiyzc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment334500> Have you tried using another display cable?
