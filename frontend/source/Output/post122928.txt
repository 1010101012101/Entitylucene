Block calls from unknown and withheld <body> How can I block calls from the "Unknown" caller? I have iOS 7 on an iPhone 4S. Does any other version of the iPhone offer this ability?  I've checked the question emCall blocking for iPhone?/em, but it doesn't seem to work for "Unknown" callers.  I found the following question: emCannot answer unknown calls on my new iPhone 4S/em.  I want to do the opposite. I want to stop unknown callers from coming up on the phone, and I would rather not know that they are calling.  <answer122936> Sorry, but true call blocking can be only done by a carrier. However, if you wish to allow calls only from your contact list, and exclude everyone else, you can use Do Not Disturb feature on your iPhone 4s.   <answer142931> For saved contacts, its easy task to block any contacts from Settings  phone  blocked option.  But for Unknown number call block follow the below steps,  Phone app  Recent  (i) symbol  Recent option (Blue watch icon)  Block this caller.  <answer222872> I phone 4s should have a function on phone to do this   <comment183875> Phone app  Recent  (i) symbol  Recent option (Blue watch icon)  Block this caller. That suggestion does not work. When you Hit the Clock symbol the second time nothing happens. I believe your service provider needs to have this function; AT&T does not, unfortunately. <comment270104> Would you care to elaborate?    I'm certain the feature does not exist...  but if you could tell us where to find it...   ? <comment270139> Are you saying that the said feature already exists? Or that you _wish_ it existed?
