Is there a way to sync Google reminders with the Mac ones <body> The macOS Calendar/iCal already syncs nicely with the Google variety. Since 2016 and shortly after the iPhone, the Google web calendar was taught how to do Reminders. Mac OS has its own flavor of Reminders. It would be most productive to be able to use both together. Is that possible?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wp0vl.png" width="300" ..synced to.. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bGg4x.png" width="200" ?  <answer269815> There is a cool implementation of Google Calendars for Mac. See this project: https://github.com/sfirrin/Clean-Google-Calendar  <comment319421> I don't think so since those reminders aren't registered as "Tasks", which is what's synced when you sign in to your google account on your iOS device. https://support.google.com/mail/answer/106237?hl=en <comment319430> Yeah, Tasks :-/. They live in Gmail but I find the connection to the calendar much more useful. Both now also overlap mightily. Not much point in using both. <comment339019> Does this Google Calendar front-end enable syncing of Reminders? <comment344243> I don't think so.
