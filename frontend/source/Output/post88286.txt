I always have strong2/strong items when I paste from the clipboard.  <answer88297> Try execute command: codepbcopy &lt;/dev/null/code.  codepbcopy/code and codepbpaste/code are two commands that provide access to clipboard. codepbcopy/code will copy a string to the clipboard (overwriting the original content).  In this case you are copying an empty file. Since you can't pass a file but a string only, this "&lt;" (a redirection) will redirect the file content to the pbcopy arguments.  <answer88776> I think that I really must re-phrase my question for clarity, i.e.  Is there a way to keep the clipboard from pasting more than one copied item strong?/strong  <comment103320> Could you elaborate on what you're exactly experiencing and provide some more information? Have you got any *clipboard enhancing* installed? <comment103325> What two items? Even after you reboot? <comment103344> Could you explain the solution a bit. <comment104062> Is there a simple means to accomplish this. <comment104426> When I use the Finder PASTE command the last TWO (2) texts copied get pasted. <comment104427> This has befuddled numerous AppleCare technicians and Genius Bar folks as well.  Try copying and pasting text to a field that renders the text as a series of bullets.  Without being able to view what was pasted there is no way to edit the text ! <comment104902> I had not understood the problem. I have never heard such a problem. I have no idea how to solve it. <comment105124> "Computer Voodoo"  No Mac Genius or Apple Care technician has a clue.
