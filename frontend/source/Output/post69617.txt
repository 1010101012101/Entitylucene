Does choosing "Reset All Settings" on an iPhone 5 cause re-activation that requires a sim card to be present? <body> I have a badly cut sim that was converted to Nano but it was cut slightly too small and damaged. I subsequently went to the Apple shop and they activated the device for me.  If I perform a "Reset All Settings", Will I need to reactivate the phone with a sim card, or will wifi only be enough?  <answer70081> When reseting your iPhone the device will need to activate against the Apple / Carrier servers for this to happen it needs to have a SIM present, even if it is unlocked  <answer129231> Reset all settings will not. Erase all content and settings, though, will need a SIM.
