Install from bootcamp usb drive on another MacBook <body> I have created an USB drive with bootcamp on my MacBook Pro Retina (Late 2014) including windows driver.  Can I use this USB drive to install Windows on my MacBook (late 2008)?  <comment240029> It might depend on which Windows, & the 08 will only support Boot Camp 4, not 5, so it might not work. <comment240033> On the MacBook2008 runs bootcamp 5.1.0. I want to install Windows 10. <comment240034> There are no Boot Camp drivers for Win 10, so the only answer is to try it & see how far you get. <comment240091> Ok, thx. Question is, are the bootcamp drivers device specific? MacBook2008 drivers for Windows7 vs MacBook2014 drivers for Windows 8. <comment240092> Possibly. I don't know for certain & without documentation it's a pure guess, but there's every chance that a specific driver-set is inserted at creation. <comment240150> You can not use a USB flash drive to install any version of Windows on a MacBoot (late 2008). If you can, you should use the DVD (optical) drive. Since I have just installed Windows 10 Pro 64 bit on my iMac (20-inch, Mid 2007), I can try to help, but I have a few questions. Is this a upgrade or a clean install. Do you have a working DVD drive on the 2008 Mac? What version of Windows 10? I mean 32 or 64 bit and Home or Pro? Did you download a free copy of Windows 10 or did you buy a copy that came with a Product key? I used a free version to upgrade and therefore did not need a product key. <comment241553> I installed Windows 10 Pro without problems. But the touchpad does not work. I tried to install the Bootcamp 5.1.0 drivers, wich are probably for Windows 7 (?) but without luck. Now I will try the 5.1.5261 drivers. I also read abotu Trackpad ++ drivers.
