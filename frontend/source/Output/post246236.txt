I'm sitting 5 meters away from the access point.  <comment303546> Any number of things could be bad in that "chain" including your wireless adapter.  If you connect to another network, does your wifi ping that router with expected speed? <comment314715> do the same but on another device, as allan said, there are so many reasons for this. try deleting your device from the router, and starting anew, then try your ping again. Sorted the same issue with me, on my BT HH5.
