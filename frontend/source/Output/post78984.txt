What does "brew --HEAD" mean? <body> I've seen it mentioned several times to fix issues with some packages, that it installs newer versions of packages somehow. But I've been unable to find a clear explanation of what that option really does, when to use it, why some packages have a --HEAD version to install and why its necessary.  <answer79017> I found some information at this github wiki.  Quoting from under the "strongAdvanced Formula Tricks/strong" section:     h2Unstable versions (codeHEAD/code, codedevel/code)/h2      Formulae can specify alternate downloads for the upstream projectâ€™s codedevel/code release (unstable but not codetrunk/code) or HEAD   (codemaster/code/codetrunk/code).      HEAD URLs (activated by passing code--HEAD/code) build the development cutting   edge.   Hopefully this helps with the what.  I can't help with the why.  <answer79018> In git using the code--HEAD/code will grab all of the latest commits from the source repo. The problem with this is sometimes the latest revision will be in an inconsistant or unbuildable state, so use at your own risk.   When you sync from other tags that are published as "known stable" releases then the developer is saying that the files as they existed at that point will build and has passed all if its tests.  Running from head can be risky.
