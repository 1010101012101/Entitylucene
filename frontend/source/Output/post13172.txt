Syncing Address book to Google Apps doesn't sync groups <body> When I sync my address book on my mac to Google Apps (gmail) it doesn't sync groups. Is this normal?  <answer13185> This isn't a supported feature of the address book/google sync.  This support article from Google (point 4) states that      "Currently, groups are not synced to   Gmail. We're hoping to add this   functionality in the future."
