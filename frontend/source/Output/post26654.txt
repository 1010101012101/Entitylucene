How can I export a video to WMV format in Lion? <body> I used to use Flip4Mac, but because QuickTime X doesn’t provide a plug-in mechanism for video exports, Flip4Mac doesn’t work with it.  How do I export videos to WMV in Lion?  <answer26657> According to this chart from Telestream site you can use Compressor 4, QT7Pro and MPEG Streamclip (never used Episode 6 so don't know what it is). You can probably install QT7 from here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T2Rwn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment30397> Excellent: QuickTime 7 Pro worked a treat. (I had a Pro license handing around from the old days.) I had to restart my Mac after installing QuickTime 7 to make it recognise Flip4Mac WMV Studio (which I already had installed), but after that it worked great. <comment30398> Yes it's probably have to be restarted fot plug-ins to be rescaned since QT is system wide
