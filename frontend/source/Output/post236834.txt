Why is AppleScript not ejecting my volume? <body> I have a hard drive in my mac with multiple partitions, and I want to eject some of them with AppleScript. Simple:  precodetell application "Finder"      eject disk "Photos" end tell /code/pre  Except it does not work. I can eject the drive from Disk Utility no problem; here it is right after ejecting:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zi0b8.png" alt="enter image description here"  So the question is, how do I debug this situation â€” what could be going wrong?  <answer236932> Someone posted this and when I reloaded the page it was gone! Not sure why: seems to work!:  precodediskutil eject "/Volumes/Photos" /code/pre  This is a shell script, not an AppleScript, but since I'm triggering it in Keyboard Maestro, it's just as good.  <comment289935> Does the AppleScript return any sort of error, or does it fail silently? Does it fail when you run it through the Script Editor? How are you running it?
