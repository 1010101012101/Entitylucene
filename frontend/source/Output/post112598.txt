Microsoft Word Forcing "Spaces" Switching <body> When I have Microsoft Word on one space, sometimes clicking anything on another desktop forces me to go back to the "space" where the Word window is. How can I prevent word from behaving this way?  <answer112610> Note: emThis is a blind answer attempt: I don't have Microsoft Office on any of my computers./em  Could you try:  precodeSystem Preferences     Mission Control /code/pre  to deactivate:  precode    ☐ Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use     ☐ When switching to an application, switch to a space with open                windows for the application /code/pre  I deactivated both because they were always disturbing my working environment in a way I wasn't able to go ahead with what I was running in parallel on many codespaces/code. Since I made this setting I'm able to work with an environment not running under my feet.
