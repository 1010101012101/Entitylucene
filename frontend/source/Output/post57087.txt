Are Macbook Pro Pre-Unibody Top Case Parts Interchangeable? <body> I have a question for service engineers here.  I wonder if and where I can source top case (with keyboard) from any pre-unibody MBP for my beaten and torn A1150 one (Core Duo original MBP)  <comment65554> Between which two models? <comment65559> There were few pre unibody 15 inch MBP models codenamed A1150, A1211(Core2Duo), A1226 and A1260(Nvidia)
