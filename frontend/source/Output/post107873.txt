Facebook Messages won't work on OS X (10.9) Messages when two-step verification and other safety features are used on Facebook <body> Does anyone know how I can get (10.9) Messages and Facebook messages to play nice?  I have some security features enabled on Facebook that make it more difficult for someone to log into my account outside of my list of trusted devices/apps. Facebook has a password generating feature that requires you to either scan a QR code or type in their generated password and it seems to only work for mobile 3rd party apps, not 3rd party OS X apps.  I did try plugging in the generated code into messages in the account set up menu but no dice.  <answer117764> You'll need to get an application specific password from Google.  ol liFire up your web browser and go to Google.com/li liOnce there, sign in if you haven't already done so./li liGo to the section where your picture is, and click on the "Account" link./li liOnce in that Account page, on the top there are links, click on the "Security" link.  Here you will probably notice that the 2-Step authentication is enabled./li liGo to the App Password's "Settings" link. It will probably ask you to authenticate yourself, go ahead and do that./li liNow you should be on the "Authorized Access to your Google Account" page, and you should be able to generate a new password for "Messages on Mavericks. Go ahead and give it a name, I named mine "Mac Pro Messages Google Talk Account", and then I clicked "Generate"./li liOnce you have this password, go to "Messages" on your Mac, try to log in and copy/paste that password./li /ol  You should be all set.  <comment138265> This is for Google chat, not for Facebook.
