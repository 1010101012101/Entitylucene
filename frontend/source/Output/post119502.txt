What is the proper way to use the cut command on ps command output <body> This question is related to a question I posted on rogue firefox procesess. It relates to firefox processes following image uploads that I have been having for a while.  I am trying to get to the second field of the codeps/code command with the following set of pipes, so that I can kill the processes from the command line quickly:  precodeps aux| grep fire|cut -f 2 /code/pre  However this produces the wrong output as it shows the whole line of ps.  I know that the default delimiter for cut is codetab/code  I have also tried:  precodeps aux| grep fire|cut -f 2 -d \t /code/pre  hr  From this question on stackoverflow I know that   precodeps axu | grep '[f]irefox' | awk '{print $2}' /code/pre  gives me the output I want.  hr  I want to understand why my two versions of cut are not working, and can it be made to work piping ps to grep and then to cut and getting to the second column (ie. the process IDs).  <answer119509> codeps/code does not use Tabs to separate column (run codeps aux &gt; foo; vi foo/code to verify). As an alternative you can codecut/code on character level by running  precodekill $(ps aux | grep fire | cut -c 17-23) /code/pre  Or you can also just run  precodepkill fire /code/pre  (or codepgrep fire/code to see which processes would match)
