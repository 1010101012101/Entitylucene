Remove and Reinstall Python on Mac -- Can I trust these old references? <body> I'm new to the mac, and apparently I've made some sort of error.  I've been learning python, via tutorials, and between Homebrew, Pip and XCode somehow my versions are all mixed.  Pip3 points to python2, so all my python3 trials fail, etc...   I'm researching how to safely remove all versions and then shoot for a clean install (homebrew?) but I'm a bit nervous.   I've found some excellent links:  ul liUninstalling Python 3 on a Mac/li liHow to uninstall Python 2.7 on a Mac OS X 10.6.4?/li /ul  Clearly one doesn't touch anything in the root code/system/code directory, and basically everything else gets deleted.   What makes me nervous, is that this links are pretty doggone old. (six years! +) I'm not sure if I really trust them or not.   Anybody been here lately?  Can I trust the postings linked above?  How do I clean up this python version mess?  Note: I'm using MacOS Sierra (10.12.5)  <answer284825> System files are protected by System Integrity Protection. You won't be able to follow these instructions to coderm -rf/code random folders in /System without disabling SIP first.  However, because the files are protected, you know the files haven't been modified. Your ‘version mess’ would be due to your shell setup and wouldn't be changed by modifying system files anyway. You shouldn't be touching these files which are guaranteed to exist in macOS.  Homebrew installs separately in /usr/local/Cellar. Use Homebrew to manage your Python installation and ignore the system installation completely.  <answer285028> So, I ended up removing all python installations, and reinstalling things via Homebrew.    ol licode$  which python/code --- code/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python/code Delete the entire Python.framework directory from code/Library/Frameworks/code./li licode$ which python3/code --- code/usr/local/bin/python3/code  Delete the entire python3 directory./li liI was a bit nervous about the symlinks.  I initially renamed the ones that were obviously going to cause me trouble. It turns out that was unnecessary.  Instead, just use:  code$  brew doctor/code  codeWarning: Broken symlinks were found. Remove them with 'brew prune':/code  precode  /usr/local/bin/python-32   /usr/local/bin/python2-32   /usr/local/bin/python2.7-32   /usr/local/bin/python2_DNU   /usr/local/bin/python_DNU   /usr/local/bin/pythonw-32   /usr/local/bin/pythonw2-32   /usr/local/bin/pythonw2.7-32 /code/pre  So, code$ brew prune/code worked perfectly. It removed all of the above symlinks.  /li liReinstall python and python3 via homebrew.  All done. /li /ol  At no time did I touch the python installation located within the code/System/code folder.    Oh, and to be clear.  The answer to the original question is      Yes, you can trust the old references, as written! That guidance is still valid.   <comment359187> Was that YES, okay to trust those two references, or NO, don't trust them?  Those references seem of high quality, well reasoned, and explained in pretty good detail. <comment359188> @zipzit You *can* trust them, but they won't work — that's two separate things. The content is trustworthy; try it on a recent version of macOS and it won't do any harm, but it also won't work, for the reasons given in this answer. I highly recommend not disabling SIP just to remove your system Python installation (which is why I haven't linked to instructions) because that's not the actual cause of your problem and won't help solve anything, potentially causing more problems in the process. <comment359190> Your answer doesn't make sense to me.  None of the quality answers linked above touches anything in `/system`.  None = Not One, Zero, Zip, Nada. There are things to delete in 1) Python 3.3 folder in your Applications folder. 2) /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework 3)  ~ 20 symlinks in /usr/local/bin. 4)  references in shell path (if exists).  I wouldn't think any of those will hit the protections you are talking about.  What am I missing? <comment359202> @zipzit Quite a while ago, Python was moved from /Library to /System/Library, so you will be touching /System in an attempt to remove the system installation. The system Python framework is in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework, not /Library. <comment359208> `$which python`  `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python`    `$ which python3`     `/usr/local/bin/python3` plus python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7 and current located at `System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/...` <comment359209> @zipzit Something else has installed it in /Library then, I don’t have Python framework at all in /Library
