Using modifier keys from a second/separate keyboard? <body> I'm using two Magic Keyboards for my macOS setup and would like to use modifier keys on one to combine with the keystrokes from the other one.   I found a related question about using a footswitch: Modifier Keys Across USB  The solution presented there requires using a USB Host Shield (?), an Arduino, and even a USB hub in some scenario. I was wondering if there is a software solution, however unlikely that may appear to be.
