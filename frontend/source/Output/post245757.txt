Limechat hotkey for switching between servers? <body> I know that you can do kbd⌘/kbd+kbd1/kbd, kbd⌘/kbd+kbd2/kbd, etc to switch between channel 1, channel 2, etc of a particular server that you are currently on. If you have multiple servers that you are connected to, is there any shortcut to switch between the servers?  <answer246288> You can use the keyboard shortcut kbdCommand/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbd1...0/kbd to switch between servers while using Limechat.  strongExample:/strong Use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbd5/kbd to switch to server 5.
