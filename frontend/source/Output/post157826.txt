How do I shut off a USB fan automatically when the Mac goes to sleep? <body> I have a Mac Mini 1.1 on which I updated the EFI firmware to v2.1 and installed Mac OS X 10.7  I'm wondering how I can cool the Mac with an external fan somehow. I found the internal cooling to be slow, so I put an external handmade USB fan on the system in an open case and this works well for my purpose.  The problem with the external fan is that when I put the computer to sleep, the fan keeps on working and I don't know how to make it stop.  I don't want to use the system fan as it looks very weak and makes a lot of noise at 3000 rpm. I don't like noise.  <answer157843> To turn off the power to your "self made USB cooling fan" (nice one) you need to put the mac mini to hibernate mode not to sleep mode.  In Terminal (found in codeApplications -&gt; Utilities/code) type  precodesudo pmset hibernatemode 1  /code/pre  <comment185615> Temps of 50-60C are normal for the C2 and C2D CPUs with normal loads.. The fan should kick in when nearing 70C <comment185621> Those are 2 questions in one. Please separate them.
