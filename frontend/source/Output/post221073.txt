MacBook not letting me log out of Guest Account <body> I'm using my brother's new MacBook and it's not letting me log out of the guest account. The only options I see are Restart and Shut Down. How can I log out of the guest account?  <answer221085> If you're not positive that your bro has Guest Account access set up, OS X introduced a new feature related to 'Find My Mac' that creates a sandboxed fake emGuest Account/em in order to make it easier to recover your mac in case it gets stolen, luring the thief to go and connect to some random Wi-Fi with the guest account.  Maybe that's what's going on, you could easily restart and login to any account you like though.   <comment267630> What happens if you just try pressing Shift+Command+Q? <comment267650> If you can open Terminal, try typing `sudo killall WindowServer` to kill WindowServer and force log out all graphical users. <comment267673> @CyberSkull I don't know of any *guest account* entitled to `sudo`. That would render any security measure useless! <comment267674> @klanomath it's been a long time since I used guest, but as I recall it did have Terminal access. <comment267675> @CyberSkull But you can't `sudo` with the guest account. In the default OS X setup only members of the admin group can `sudo`. <comment267676> @klanomath I could have sworn that `sudo` could prompt for a username? Or am I conflating it with `su`? <comment267678> @CyberSkull `sudo` as well as `su` can prompt for a username but the username has to be enabled in the /etc/sudoers file for the former or in /etc/pam.d/su by group membership for the latter to successfully switch to root/admin.
