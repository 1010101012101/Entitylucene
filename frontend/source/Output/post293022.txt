locale: LC_ALL is empty <body> In my ~/.profile  precodeexport LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 /code/pre  But $ locale prints empty LC_ALL:  precodeLANG="en_US.UTF-8" LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8" LC_CTYPE="UTF-8" LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8" LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8" LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8" LC_ALL= /code/pre  How can I set LC_ALL to "en_US.UTF-8" ?  <answer293024> ZSH seems not to source ~/.profile   I added the two export statements into ~/.zshrc and the issue is solved.  <comment369712> The right file to set these is: `~/.zprofile`. You don't need to repeat these settings for every shell or subshell: once per session is enough. Moreover, once `LANG` is set, and if the `LC_â€¦` aren't different, they don't need to be set, they will inherit `${LANG}`. <comment369723> `locale` is set by the terminal emulator (Terminal.app) when you start the app and `LC_ALL`  does not need to be set unless you want to change the default `LANG` settings for `LC_COLLATE` and others.
