Keyboard Maestro interfering with control-tab action in browsers - how to disable? <body> I've just purchased Keyboard Maestro, and now when I am in a browser and click control-tab, I can no longer advance through the open tabs of the browser the way I did before. That key combination must be used in KM to do something, and that's pre-empting the system shortcut.  How can I find out what action is attached to that keystroke in KM (so I can either change it or disable it)?  <answer131330> Are you using Keyboard Maestro 6? According to their website, kbdctrl/kbd + kbdtab/kbd is for windows switcher.   I don't have keyboard maestro, but if you can disable the window switcher, that will fix it.   Alternatively, follow this to emre-replace/em that shortcut. I'll copy and paste that here, with a few differences for your case:     Go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Application Shortcuts      Then, click the "+" button.
