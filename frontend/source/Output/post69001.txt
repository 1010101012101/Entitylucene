How to extract the text of a PDF document with Automator, and save it in a directory <body> How can you modify the output folder of the Extract PDF text action ? I made a basic workflow to extract the text of PDF files, but the output folder is stuck to codeDesktop/code. I can change it in Automator, but the changes are not saved. It reverts to Desktop when I reopen the workflow.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJG9T.png" alt="Automator" Bureau means Desktop. This is the one that refuses to be set.  <answer69020> This seems to be a bug with Automator, as I can reproduce the same problem.  The workaround is to have Automator move the file to your desired destination after the text is extracted. Just add the strongMove Finder Items/strong action (sorry, I'm not sure of the exact french translation) after the Extract action, and set it to your desired directory.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkEj0.png" alt="Move Finder Items action"  <answer69021> Instead of directly choosing a directory in the drop-down menu, which for some reason, doesn't work, choose: New variable.  Then choose a name, and a directory where you want the files to be saved.  <comment80188> I may have a solution, but can you show the workflow first so I can get a better idea of what you are doing. <comment80189> The whole workflow consists in one action:extract PDF text. It just refuses to accept another output directory <comment80190> Do you have the 'show this action.." ticked in the options
