changing user prompt terminal <body> I am new to using macs. I was using the codebash/code shell, but recently tried switching to using iTerm2 and codezsh/code. Originally, it looked the way I wanted, but something changed and reformatted my shell.   Basically I want my user prompt when it opens to look like this... I want to go back to the original iterm2 and zsh defaults  https://draculatheme.com/iterm/  Instead of the code-&gt;/code , my terminal has codeUsername@PCname: ~%/code  strongEdit/strong  ECHO $SHELL gives   precode/bin/bash /code/pre  more /etc/shells outputs:   precodeList of acceptable shells for chpass(1). Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using one of these shells.  /bin/bash /bin/csh /bin/ksh /bin/sh /bin/tcsh /bin/zsh /code/pre  <answer282675> It looks like your shell is currently set to bash.  From the iTerm2 profiles menu select open profiles. Now you can either create a new profile or modify the default. If you click edit profile this will bring up a preferences window. On this configuration window you can set the "Command" to /bin/zsh.  Hope that works for you.  <comment356123> Would adding `PROMPT='%F{magenta}-'` to your `.zshrc` work for you? <comment356129> Didn't work. Can I start over? E.g. start from the bash shell that comes with the terminal , uninstall iterm and zsh and then reinstall? <comment356163> Reinstalling won't delete any config files like .zshrc etc <comment356228> If you create a new profile you'll need to set it as default or access it from the Profile menu. Otherwise a solid answer.
