Cross-Platform Password Management <body> I am looking for a password manager that is compatible with open-source password database files, such as those used by KeePass (.kdb) or PasswordSafe (.psafe3). Both of those projects have terrible Mac clients - I'm looking for something a little more polished, but can still share password databases with Windows and Linux users.  <answer58919> The excellent 1Password by AgileBits supports import for both of the formats you mention:     h21Password can import data from many popular applications, including:/h2      AppShelf   AutoID   Data Guardian1 (formerly Password Retriever)   eWallet2   KeePass and KeePassX   LicenseKeeper   Minefield   Password Safe 3   PasswordWallet by S3   Passwords Plus3   RoboForm Passcards and Safenotes   SplashID by SplashData   TurboPasswords (formerly Cloak)   Web Confidential   Highly recommended app, well worth the purchase price.  (EDIT) 1Password does not include Linux support at present, just OS X, Windows, iOS and Android.  <comment67875> There is not 1Pwd for Linux though. <comment67887> No Linux support is the only major flaw with 1Password.  However, you can use the 1PasswordAnywhere feature.  For security reasons, I wouldn't use the recommended DropBox functionality, though.  That being said, putting it on a USB stick has its own issues.  Personally, when I'm away from my Mac, I just use the 1Password iPhone app (also for Android). <comment67888> edited the answer to mention lack of Linux support.  still a great app. <comment67894> @Max, Richard, da4 - We're keeping track of departmental equipment logins, not personal logins, and we have engineers on all three platforms. We're trying to decide on a password file format to keep in our version control system. (We have a near zero budget for this, no fancy web applications, alack.) - most of the OSS password managers work spiffy on windows and Linux both - just not on the Mac. <comment67896> I haven't used it in that kind of environment (or anywhere outside of home), but have you looked into https://www.gpgtools.org/ ?  Be sure to update this question if you ever do find a solution to your liking. <comment69100> 1Password requires a plaintext export from inside KeePass - it cannot read or import a .kdb file.
