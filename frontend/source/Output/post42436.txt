Lock & Unlock the screen via WLAN - Keyboard <body> strongI use Synergy to share my mouse and keyboard across different computers./strong   Now i want to lock and unlock the screen of my mac. I have activated corners, so when i move my mouse at the left corner of my screen, it gets dark.     But when i want to unlock the screen, nothing happens! My Mac doesn't   recognize any mouse movements or keyboard actions.   I need to lock &amp; unlock the mac screen for testing purpose.   Is there any script command which can lock and unlock my screen by itself?      For example: lock my screen for 5 secondes, and unlock it again after   this period of time.   <answer42438> You may be able to work something together in automator but I am not too familiar with that app.  I would check and see if you have wake for network access on.  In System Preferences-Energy Saver there is a checkbox to "wake for network access". If that is unchecked it is unlikely your computer will respond since I believe that app is based on Networking  [UPDATE]: Doing a quick search it appears other users are experiencing this issue with synergy and lion. take a look here
