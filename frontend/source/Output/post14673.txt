Gmail "On Behalf Of" Feature in Mail.app <body> I use Gmail with Mail.app. As you know Gmail allows replying mails as someone else (by changing codeFrom/code header of the sent e-mail). If you don't know, you can register multiple mails to Gmail (your personal mail, work mail etc.) and you can send mail from them from one account.   Let's say you have 3 mails registered in GMail: codeg@gmail.com/code, codea@a.a/code and codeb@b.b/code. Your account is codeg@gmail.com/code in this case. When you use GMail web interface, if you receive a mail redirected from codea@a.a/code, when you press Reply, it sends your mail as codea@a.a/code (or you can choose other accounts to mimic one of your e-mail addresses as sender).  However when I'm in Mail.app, I'm only able to send mail as codeg@gmail.com/code, any ideas to solve this?  <answer14675> Under 'Accounts' in 'Preferences' change the 'Email Address:' to the address you want to use. I don't believe you can switch addresses at send time. You'll have to add a separate account for each email address you want to send from.  <answer14676> Under codeAccounts/code in codePreferences/code, there's a field there called "Email Address:".  You can put a comma-separated list of addresses in there, like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LKNPQ.png" alt="Multiple Emails"  Now your "Compose" window will have a "From" popup menu that lets you choose your sending address:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Krsf.png" alt="Choose your from address"  AFAIK, this works for pretty much any mail account type, as long as your mail provider allows you to muck around with the codeFrom:/code header.  <comment15789> That's so sad :( <comment15808> Worked like a charm! Thanks! <comment15922> solution suggested only works for mobile me accounts.... <comment15923> No, I'm able to use them with my google apps account and POP3 account I have from school (which is also registered on Gmail).
