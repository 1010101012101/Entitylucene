Problems running MS Office 2016 after upgrading to El Capitan <body> I updated to the new OS so that I could load Microsoft Office 2016 for MAC as my current OS did not support 2016.  Now when I open excel or word, I get      Microsoft Excel wants to use your confidential information stored in "Microsoft Identity xxxxxxxxx" in your Keychain.  Do you want to allow access to this item?      Always Allow - Deny -Allow   I have always selected Deny in the past and it would go away.  Now it won't go away and it won't quit out of the program as I must always Force Quit the Microsoft application, whether Word or Excel.  How can I get past this dialogue?  <answer222311> If you click deny, it won't go away and it can not update your previous Office 2016 identity.      How can I get past this dialogue?   Always Allow and it will disappear.  <comment269299> This site works better if you stick to one question per post. I've edited out one of the questions, feel free to ask it seperately. <comment269301> Also, why do you not want to click "Allow"?
