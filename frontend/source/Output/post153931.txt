Is it a way to remove App from iTunes Connect? <body> Accidentally I used wrong naming convention for my codeBundle ID/code in my App, and I want to delete that App from iTunes Connect, is it somehow possible? I already removed from codedeveloper.apple.com &gt; Identifier &gt; App IDs/code that certain codeBundle ID/code. What else I can do?  App is still in codePrepare for Submission/code state.  <answer153962> There is no way to do it. To delete an app, this must be approved first.     Apps that have not been approved yet can't be deleted.   Transferring and Deleting Apps  <answer228829> New feature is added by Apple to delete app from iTunesconnect.apple.com Please check below link for the same  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/TransferringAndDeletingApps.html  <answer248427> While you can't delete an app that has not been approved, you can edit and reuse the same app record for a new app.  When I talked to Apple's Developer Support team about a previously rejected and abandoned app in our account, this is the method they suggested as it is possible to edit the bundle identifier, app name and all existing assets prior to submitting for review, essentially making a new app record out of the old one.   We did this, noting the circumstances of the previous rejection in the App Review section and that they did not apply to the new app, and were able to successfully reuse the old record.   <comment186467> And if app is approved and then deleted will the app thumbnail dismiss for iTunes app list or only it will be removed from App Store, but symbol keeps exist in iTunes connect? .. you know I have many apps now in iTunes list and I wants to get rid of rubbish <comment186577> Both, removed from App Store and from your iTunes Connect. <comment220955> Apple have some stupid rules. This is one. <comment229858> I was checking for name availability and unintentionally "created" an app that I now can't delete.  This is asinine! <comment240784> This is ridiculousâ€¦
