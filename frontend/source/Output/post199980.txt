How do I make Evernote always paste in the matching font? <body> When I paste text from another application into Evernote it always uses some random strange font from the source.  How do I change Evernote so that it keeps the font the same as the font in the note I am pasting the text. It seems fairly logical to me but I cannot fathom why it does anything else!  <answer199981> What you want can be achieved using strongPaste and Match Style/strong  ul liEdit  Paste and Match Style/li /ul  Keyboard shortcut kbdshift/kbd+kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdV/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEHGH.png" alt="Match Style"  This will paste in your clipboard content matching the current style of text in your note.  <comment241142> You rock thanks a lot! <comment241147> It's a pleasure!
