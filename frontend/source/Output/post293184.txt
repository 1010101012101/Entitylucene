Duplicating an entire disk <body> I need to replace a fairly new disk with a emphysically/em smaller one.  It's not bootable: a Time Machine partition, an HFS+ storage partition, and an ExFat that has a trivial amount of Windows storage on it.  Can codedd/code duplicate the whole thing, partition map and three partitions?  Or do I have to partition it first and then do each partition?  Or should I just use Disk Utility as in How to clone an entire disk with Lion (+Rescue) &amp; Bootcamp Partitions  Actually, given the 4TB size, and the throughput of USB, I guess I need not the easiest method, but the fastest.  That's probably Disk Utility, but it won't do the whole disk.  I have to first match the partitions, then do them individually.  UPDATE: The reason for copying from a strongnew/strong disk to another of the same capacity is that the old one was too large to squeeze into the bag for travel.  Unfortunately, the strongemnew/em/strong drive failed during the copy!!  I had to start a new set of backups on the smaller one.  Hopefully when I come back in three months, I can recover data and get my money back.  Western Digital, only a month old with a three-year warranty.  <answer293216> If you have a more complete answer, by all means, post.  'dd' is simpler, if you get the details right on the command line.  Disk Utility however, may be faster even though you have to partition and then restore each partition in turn.  This is because 'dd' is going to copy all the unused blocks.  In my case, with both of them on USB 2.0, if the drive hadn't failed, it would have taken sixty hours.  <comment369902> You cannot `dd` a larger disk to a smaller disk. <comment369903> Do you know what the word "physically" means? <comment369905> @WGroleau Obviously the physical size (e.g. form factor) is completely irrelevant here and you should add the sizes of the two disks in TB/GB. Also add the physical block sizes (either 512 or 4096 - the final gpts differ slightly). <comment369906> You asked in the comment following my first comment, "Do you know what the word "physically" means?", and I'm assuming in the context of `dd` it was used such that the destination disk capacity is smaller then the source disk capacity, and if that's the wrong assumption then your question is poorly written!   klanomath's comment points out exactly why! <comment369916> The physical size is not relevant to the copy; it was mentioned to avoid wasted advice to keep using a perfectly good disk that won't fit in my luggage.  I didn't mention the capacity at all, because obviously they have to be the same. <comment369922> @WGroleau They don't have to be the same: the destination disk should have the same size or larger (when both have the same physical block size). If the source disk has a pbs of 512 and the destination disk 4096 the dest disk has to be slightly larger (or more) than the source disk **and** fulldisk-to-fulldisk dd won't work (and vice-versa)... <comment369929> If the destination is larger, it's difficult to get access to the extra space.
