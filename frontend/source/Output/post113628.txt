Screen captures of windows larger than screen <body> Is there a way to capture a screenshot of a browser window / webpage which is larger than the MacBook Air (1366x768) screen it's displayed on?  I need to have captures of how a site displays in a 1280x1024 window. I can use Moom to resize the browser window, but not sure how to get the snap.  <answer113639> You can take screenshots of entire windows, even those that extend beyond the bounds of the screen, by strongpressing ⌘⇧4, then space, then clicking the window/strong.  <comment133340> Hmm. In my case, it just gave me a shot of the window that was visible on screen but I'm looking for a slightly different use case. <comment170339> Pressing ⌘⇧4, then space, then clicking the window only enables you to capture the visible parts on the screen. To capture a whole webpage, you can use Snagit, or some web-based applications like [Site2pic](http://www.site2pic.com/) and [Webpage Screenshot Capture](http://screenshot.net/webpage-screenshot). All these tools allow you to screenshot an entire webpage just with its URL. <comment170340> True for both — I use a Chrome extension to do that sort of thing — but I was looking for the browser window, and not just the webpage. My question was a bit unclear. I do appreciate your chiming in though.
