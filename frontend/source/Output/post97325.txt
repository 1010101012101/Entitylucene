Why am I not able to expand my hard drive partition after deleting Windows? <body> I'm a MacBook user and I had previously installed Windows on my laptop.   After deleting the Windows partition now, I'm facing difficulty in expanding my hard drive partition to the maximum. After I drag the the partition to emFull/em and click emApply/em, it shows:     Checking journaled HFS+ volume   Then, a message pops out:     Partition failed with the error : couldn't modify partition map because file system verification failed.    What should I do?  <answer97326> Try this:  ol liReboot the Mac into Single User Mode by holding âŒ˜ (Command) + S when pressing the power button./li liWhen the command prompt finally appears, type:  code/sbin/fsck - fy/code/li liAfter this is completed, type codereboot/code or codeexit/code./li liWait for Mac to start up normally./li liBack in Disk Utility, hit codeVerify Disk/code, then try and partition as normal./li /ol  <answer97342> Simply Hold Shift before startup. This brings the mac into safe mode and it checks the system for errors. Then try modifying the partition again.   <comment114358> http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1417 says that "If you're using Mac OS X 10.4 or later, you should use Disk Utility instead of fsck, whenever possible". <comment114359> It just verifies or repairs the startup volume (the partition like `Macintosh HD`), which can also be done from Disk Utility. <comment114361> Disk utility is UNABLE to repair the volume because it's the startup volume. Going into safe mode checks and Repairs any errors on the drive as well <comment114364> Disk Utility does allow repairing the startup volume if you start up from a recovery partition or installation disk. When I tried [starting up in safe mode with verbose mode enabled](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/92266/understanding-how-safe-boot-fixed-a-boot-problem/92315#92315), it only seemed to check the Macintosh HD volume and not the drive.
