How can I list all my passwords stored in Keychain Access? <body> I am trying to use the 'security find-internet-password' command to show my passwords. I want to write a script to loop through my keychain and list all of my passwords.  I have read the man page for security and tried the examples but cannot get it to return any of my passwords.  Here is the command from the man page:  precodefind-internet-password [-h] [-a account] [-s server] [options...] [-g] [keychain...]             -a account      Match account string             -c creator      Match creator (four-character code)             -C type         Match type (four-character code)             -d securityDomain                             Match securityDomain string             -D kind         Match kind string             -j comment      Match comment string             -l label        Match label string             -p path         Match path string             -P port         Match port number             -r protocol     Match protocol (four-character code)             -s server       Match server string             -t authenticationType                             Match authenticationType (four-character code)             -g              Display the password for the item found             -w              Display the password(only) for the item found /code/pre  I have tried several syntaxes for the command including leaving the keychain value blank. in the below examples admin is a account name for one of my internet accounts. I would prefer to be able to get all of the passwords at once but when I dump-keychain it gives an unreadable mess of text with lots of tags that I cannot parse. Is there any   precode$ security find-internet-password -a admin -g  $ security find-internet-password -a admin -g login $ security fine-internet-password -a admin -g user $ security find-internet-password -a admin -g /Users/Chilly/Library/Keychains/user /code/pre  I would prefer to be able to get all of the passwords at once but when I dump-keychain it gives an unreadable mess of text with lots of tags that I cannot parse. Is there any documentation on the web for the format of that dump file or how to parse it. Suggestions I have seen say to just 'grep' the file but I need documentation to know what to look for. (and to read a manual on grep and awk and sed but those are widely available:-)  <answer282392> This will dump your login passwords:  precodesudo security dump-keychain -d login.keychain &gt; keychain.txt /code/pre  And this is a script that can convert it to human readable format: https://gist.github.com/rwest/1583781  NB: The Ruby script worked for me only after I removed the line containingÂ code.gsub!('htps', 'https');/code.  And, optionally, here is another applescript which will autoclick for you the OS security confirmation dialog: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/137336/66812.  <comment355711> Check [this comment](https://gist.github.com/rwest/1583781#gistcomment-1633085) for a ruby script working without removing lines!
