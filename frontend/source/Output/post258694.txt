macOS Sierra Preview Extra Services <body> When I highlight text and right click, I usually get this menu: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9hTCl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Notice at the bottom where I have custom services such as "Custom Text To Speech" and "Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track". This use to also be available in Preview when I would read a pdf but now only this appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nI7VU.png" alt="enter image description here"  I need this feature for custom services I use but it seems to not be available in macOS Sierra's version of Preview.   <answer259892> You need to enable the service in the keyboard system preferences, like so: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFnKY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer273838> macOS Sierra introduced a new PDFKit framework. The apps which are based on PDFKit do not support text services (the services which are only available when text is selected).  Preview, Skim, Safari's built-in PDF viewer, and Chrome's built-in PDF viewer all do not support text services.  Firefox's built-in PDF viewer supports text services, but you need access the service from menu bar (Firefox - Services) after selecting some text.  <comment324872> How is the service programmed? Is it standalone, or was it created with Automator? <comment325150> It is a Automator services but it other stock text services like "Summarize" and "Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track" also don't work. @tubedogg
