Upgrading SSD on 2015 MacBook Pro <body> I'm about to buy a 15" Macbook Pro with 512 GB SSD. Does anyone know if it is possible to upgrade the SSD after I have bought it?   <answer195208> Is it possible?    Yes.  The question is can you get a drive to upgrade to?  Apple uses a "proprietary PCIe 2.0 x4" interface for their storage.  There are SSDs out there that match the specs (like this Samsung on Amazon), but for some reason they are not compatible  So, bottom line....  Yes, you can upgrade it, but only with a genuine Apple SSD (at this point).  Your best bet is to get the most you can afford now because there is zero cost savings plus the added headache of disassembly/reassembly.  IMO, it just isn't worth it.  <comment233035> OWC sell them - http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/ I've no idea what it would do to your warranty. <comment233037> @Tetsujin, Are you sure OWC sells them for the 2015 MBP?  From what I see I'd say no. <comment233038> @Tetsujin.  That one is incompatible.  The highest model that OWC supports is MacbookPro10,1 which is the MBP 2013 model.  The 2015 MBP is identified as MacBookPro11,4 <comment233039> ah, OK - I couldn't figure out what the machine number was - the ad just said 09 - 'current' guess they need to revise their estimate of 'current' <comment233045> @Tetsujin, one of the best information resources I found for Apple-branded products is [Mactracker](http://www.mactracker.ca).  It goes way back and is kept current too, if you allow the app to update itself.
