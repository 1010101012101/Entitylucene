How do I sign out of all devices currently using my Apple ID? <body> I have an ex that is using my Apple ID, and I want to get him off my account. I have changed my password, but as he was already signed in, it appears that he is still using my account.   I remember once in the past when I changed my password, I was given the option to sign out of all devices currently using that Apple ID, but that option seems to have disappeared.  <answer150295> Go to https://www.icloud.com/#settings &amp; hit "Sign out of all browsers' then change your password again.  <answer219952> https://www.icloud.com/#settings  Using this I have sign out from all the browsers and simultaneously in the same browser I was signed in https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage here, but this sign out does not work, because still I was able to access my account on different tab. Not sure for the iPhone.  <answer240165> Go to itunes official site You will see the bag icon on the top right corner     press account (log in necessary)    edit apple ID (you will be asked to re-enter your password)   click devices (you will have to answer 2 of your security questions)   see all the devices that are using your apple ID   click the remove maked red below the device   If you forgot the answers to the security questions, you can reset it by sending a verification through email. Re-answer your security questions then go through the process again.   I used my iPhone6 in doing this so using other devices might have a different format or placement of the icons.   <comment176901> Changing your password *should* sign out your Apple ID, but I have no citable reference for this. <comment176923> I agree with @grgarside. Without researching how Apple handles authentication, typically an account user (any device signed into your Apple ID) would access servers using the *credentials provided originally*. It would not know the new password and hence further use would be impossible.
