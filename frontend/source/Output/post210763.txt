MacOS El Capitan icon change <body> I having a big question with some icons i change. I managed to move into rootless by restarting and emCMD + R/em to boot into Recovery, then utilities and terminal. On terminal i wrote      csrutil disable   to disable S.I.P. , after that , regular boot and opened Iconlite.app to change the icons, i changed almost all xd then i repeat the process but this time with     csrutil enable   this time to get S.I.P. and the system normal. Well, i'd change a lot of them included that HD icons that appears on emBoot + OPT/ALL/em to select in which SO i want to start.  The question is that in my user some icons still being the same BUT on guest user that icons are actually changed, i just wanna know why or how i should get that change on my user as well.  The next image shows what i mean on the Finder, Safari, Calendar are different  **I just forgot and i didn't change the System Preferences icon   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yR4bG.jpg" alt="icons comparative"  Thanks in advance for any answer :)  <answer210776> Sounds like the icon cache may need to be cleared. The terminal command you'll want to run is:  precodesudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \; /code/pre  ..and then log out and back in.  <comment254450> OMG that worked perfectly, thanks a lot man! <comment254554> Great to hear :D - Please mark the answer as accepted by clicking on the checkmark so others can find this in the future!
