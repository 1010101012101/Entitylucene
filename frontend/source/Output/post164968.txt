How to use the "Paste Formatting" function via Keyboard in PowerPoint? <body> In Powerpoint 2013 (Windows) there is a function "Paste formatting only" (Ctrl + Shift + V) that will apply formatting of the object in the clipboard to the currently selected object (see list of shortcuts).  In Powerpoint 2011 (Mac) so far I could not find a similar function (see list of shortcuts).  Does such a command exist and is there a way to use it with keyboard shortcuts? Can it maybe simulated with a VBA macro?
