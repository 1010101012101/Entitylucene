How can I trim the first 3 characters in file name with AppleScript? <body> Is there a way to trim off the first 3 character of multiple file names? (or last 3 characters)  <answer20135> This code will do it for you:  precodeset whichFile to choose file with multiple selections allowed repeat with aFile in whichFile     tell application "Finder"         set filename to name of aFile         set name of aFile to ((characters 4 thru -1 of filename) as string) --trim first 3         --set name of whichFile to ((characters 1 thru -4 of filename) as string) --trim last 3     end tell end repeat /code/pre  Note that stripping the last three will get rid of the extension. If that isn't what you want to happen, let me know in a comment.  <answer73023> Here's a shorter script:  precodetell application "Finder"     repeat with f in (choose file with multiple selections allowed)         set name of f to text 4 thru -1 of (get name of f)     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Renaming files is often easier in the shell though:  precodefor f in *; do mv "$f" "${f:3}"; done /code/pre  Parameter expansion is documented in codefile:///usr/share/doc/bash/bashref.html#SEC30/code.  <answer84629> Here is an Automator Workflow as a Service that will do what you want it to do.  All you have to do is load this workflow, and duplicate it to a Service and call the Service "Trim First 3" or something, then save it.  Then select a folder and select this service and it will take all files in the folder and trim the first 3 characters of the file name.   Good luck.

Fixed; it should work now. <comment22286> Sorry, I meant multiple file names. <comment22287> @daviesgeek Updated version above. <comment22288> It doesn't exactly work. I have a bunch of files named test.txt, test copy.txt, test copy 2.txt, etc. When I ran your script, it clipped off the 3 characters in the middle i.e.: t copy.txt, t copy 2.txt. <comment22289> @daviesgeek It worked. Here's why: `[tes]t copy.txt`. If you remove the first three chars (in brackets), you get `t copy.txt`. It looks the same as if it clipped from the middle. Try it with a file called `abcdefgh.txt`. <comment22296> Duh!! So sorry! I should've thought that through.
