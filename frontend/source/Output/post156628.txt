iMessage on iPhone 3 <body> My friend gave me an old iPhone 3. I have an iPod touch 4. I tried to set up iMessage with my current apple ID but it won't work. No messages will send and I won't receive any on the iPhone. In my settings it says my iMessage is connect with my apple ID. Is it not possible to use iMessage on an iPhone 3 that has no service? If it is how do I do it?   it has iOS 6.1.6  <comment184172> There never was an iPhone 3.  Assuming you mean iPhone 3G, that latest iOS it can use is 4.2.1 - which is before iMessage, so I think you're out of luck.  [I think iMessage needs iOS 5 minimum]  iPhone 3GS can use iOS 6.1.6 which ought to work. Please edit your question to provide more info. <comment184173> it has iOS 6.1.6 <comment184193> @Tetsujin I think it's a 3GS. <comment184221> maybe have a look at http://support.apple.com/en-gb/TS4268 as it ought to work, so long as you have a good wifi connection.
