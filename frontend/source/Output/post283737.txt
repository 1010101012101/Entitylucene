I tried several ISP. I don't have static, all parameters are dynamic @Allan <comment357776> Don't see how it's **not** related to DNS since you can't resolve but, hey......  try the following `host` commands:  `host name.of.host` and then again but specify an outside DNS server `host name.of.host 8.8.8.8`  post the output in your original question <comment357780> Both commands return correct IPs <comment357781> `ping` and `wget` still resolves to incorrect <comment357785> Go into your network settings under Sys Prefs and **release** the DHCP lease then renew it.  See if that fixes it.  It's important that you release the lease first. <comment357790> I see only `Renew DHCP Lease`
