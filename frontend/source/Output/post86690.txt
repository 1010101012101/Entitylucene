Why does my Mac mini answers pings while asleep? <body> My Mac mini late 2012 behaves strangely:  When awake the computer answers ping correctly:  precode64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=4.201 ms  64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=4.823 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=7 ttl=64 time=5.108 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=8 ttl=64 time=4.400 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=9 ttl=64 time=4.523 ms /code/pre  Right after going to sleep it stops responding, while it switches to 100 MbE:  precodeRequest timeout for icmp_seq 10 Request timeout for icmp_seq 11 Request timeout for icmp_seq 12 Request timeout for icmp_seq 13 /code/pre  But then, still sleeping, it responds again. It's still on 100 MbE.  precode64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=14 ttl=32 time=3.897 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=15 ttl=32 time=3.918 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=16 ttl=32 time=3.906 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=17 ttl=32 time=4.090 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.12: icmp_seq=18 ttl=32 time=4.066 ms /code/pre  This also works via IPv6. Why is this?  <comment100204> Is it possibly related to WoL? <comment100206> Maybe, but I don't see any reason why. <comment100220> The network card has to be awake to WoL so looks like it also responds to pings (or is this actual WoL) <comment100221> Have you ruled out [bonjour sleep proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_Sleep_Proxy) and that your router / switch might be responding to network requests while the hardware is asleep so that it can send a wake message to the hardware should you need to use a sharing service remotely? <comment100375> Can be a sleep proxy or router as I detached all other devices for testing purpose. As soon as I disanle WoL, the Mac shuts down its ethernet port making itself unreachable.
