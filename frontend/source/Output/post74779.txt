launchtl: any way to disable a daemon after removing the plist file? <body> I was trying to permanently disable a 3rd party daemon, so I deleted its plist file from /Library/LaunchDaemons-- and then I realized that I hadn't done a codelaunchctl unload/code on it first; trying after the fact yields "No such file or directory/nothing found to unload".  And, of course the daemon is restartable, so when I kill it, it gets recreated.  I tried doing codelaunchctl list/code in hopes of getting a label to use for codelaunchctl remove/code but the daemon is no longer listed.  Short of rebooting, is there any way to get launchd to forget about the daemon and/or re-scan the configuration files?  <answer74782> To see ALL the daemons currently running, you need to type:  precodesudo launchctl list /code/pre  And then you can remove it, for example:  precodesudo launchctl remove com.sassafras.KeyAccess.daemon /code/pre  <comment86944> Huh, I guess if you're not root, it only shows the daemons launched for/as the user? <comment175778> This doesn't actually work for me. The entries come back on reboot. <comment206726> @dimadima did you remove the associated plist file(s)? The commands provided by Dan only manipulate the current state (which is reset at next boot time to whatever is in /Library/LaunchDaemons). <comment206781> @jhfrontz yup I've learned by now that you have to do that. Thank you. <comment338052> @jhfrontz so the process should be `launchctl unload` then delete the `.plist` file is that correct? <comment338401> @JohnnyQ  -- yes, I think that's the correct order.
