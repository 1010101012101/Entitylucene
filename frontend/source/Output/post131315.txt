After update OSX 10.9.3 Mack-book Pro 2010, Restart suddenly <body> Yesterday I get OSX 19.9.3 after update, my MBP 2010 getting restart when i open VLC, illustrator and sometimes Safari. The message shows "Your Computer restarted because of a Problem. Press any key to continue starting up".  strongWhy this happen?/strong  <answer131372> Sounds like a kernel problem. It could be that you have a corrupt hard drive and that the installation was garbled during the install. It could be that you had a corrupted version of the installer (though it likely wouldn't have finished installing were that the case). You should run disk utility to verify your drive isn't damaged, then reinstall the OS.  <answer131376> There are reports of Dropbox causing kernel panics on 10.9.3. If you have Dropbox installed, try quitting the dropbox agent. If the kernel panics cease, then wait for Dropbox to update their software.  First, click the dropbox icon in the menu bar, then click the gear icon in the bottom-right. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O4LtO.png" alt="Dropbox menu"  Then quit Dropbox from the popup menu. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ihpla.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment154474> Is there any solutions for this?

One thing you can do is run Disk Utility and run Verify Disk on your HD. If that goes well, try Repair Permissions.
