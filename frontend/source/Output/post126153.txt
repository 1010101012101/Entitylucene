Change keyboard layout but keep shortcuts <body> I use three different keyboard layouts for three different languages on a regular basis and use a shortcut to cycle between them (this is very handy).   The one issue I regularly encounter is that many shortcuts change because the letter on the keyboard changes place, so the shortcut is the same, e.g., kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd[/kbd, but it's on a completely different position on the keyboard which makes the whole shorcut-thing not so short.  So is there a way to change the keyboard layout but keep the position of the keys used in shortcuts the same?
