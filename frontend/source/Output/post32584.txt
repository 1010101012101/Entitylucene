KeePass 2.17 fails to start <body> I installed the newest Mono framework on Lion. After that I tried installing KeePass 2.17 from http://keepass2.openix.be/. When I try to start the application it probably fails, silently (it looks as if nothing happened). How can I check what happened?  Does anybody know how to use KeePass 2.x on MacOS Lion?  <answer32792> I found the problem and have a workaround until the developer publishes a fix.  ul liIn your Applications folder, right click on the app and choose Show Package Contents./li liNavigate to the Contents/MacOS folder and open codestartkeepass.sh/code in TextEdit.  Change this line:  codepath="/Applications/KeePass2.16.app/Contents/MacOS"/code  to this:  codepath="/Applications/KeePass2.17.app/Contents/MacOS"/code  (Replace the 6 with a 7)./li liSave and close./li /ul  Now the application should start up.  <answer211734> I resolved my issues by using KeepassX (version 2.0 alpha 4), which appears to have less functions, but is natively integrated in OsX and copy-and-paste works as expected.  <comment37566> If you don't mess around with the content of the application package, opening Terminal and execution `sudo ln -s /Applications/KeyPass2.16.app /Applications/KeypPass2.17.app` should do the trick as well. You may have to remove the link again before installing a new version though. <comment37722> That works, and what a silly bug it is :).
