Disabling app updates <body> I have iOS 8.2 running on my iPod Touch (7); and since I downloaded iOS 8, all of my apps update automatically. I personally don't like that at all, I want to see what updates are available and what apps want to update before they do, not after.   Is there any way that I can disable this feature?  <answer180044> Settings  iTunes &amp; App Store  Automatic Downloads  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yJgMh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment213691> Thanks! That was easy... I thought I had already done that XD <comment213695> OS update may have reset it. I have a feeling I thought I'd done it too...
