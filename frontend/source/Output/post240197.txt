Adding newline to lists inside Notes app <body> When I'm typing a list, I very often want additional newlines between some (or all) of the items to provide some clearer separation. In many apps that allow lists, you can type Alt+Enter or Command+Enter to add a newline without adding a new list item. However, this doesn't seem to work in Notes.  strongIs there something similar for the Notes app so that I can add newlines in the middle of a list without creating a new list item?/strong  <answer240208> I'm assuming your question is about the emNotes/em app on emOSX/em.  When typing your list hold codeCntl + Enter/code to add a newline.  After the newline, just hit codeEnter/code again to resume the numbering.  This will give you a blank line between numbers in the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BErlh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment295188> Ahhh! Thank you! I could have sworn I tried that already...
