Is there a way to launch uTorrent and not display the GUI window? <body> Since uTorrent to my best of knowledge doesen't support a daemon/server mode, I would like to add it to launchd to start upon login (and restart after a potential crash), strongbut without the app window opening/strong.   Is there a way to do this?  <answer93450> Try saving a plist like this as code~/Library/LaunchAgents/utorrent.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;utorrent&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;open&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-gjWa&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;uTorrent&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  It can be loaded with codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/utorrent.plist/code or by logging out and back in.  precode  -W, --wait-apps   Blocks until the used applications are closed (even if they were already running).   -j, --hide        Launches the app hidden.   -g, --background  Does not bring the application to the foreground. /code/pre  code/Applications/uTorrent.app/Contents/MacOS/uTorrent/code would display a visible uTorrent window if uTorrent wasn't already running.  Another option might be to add a line like this to crontab:  precode*/5 * * * * pgrep -xq uTorrent &amp;&amp; osascript -e 'launch app "uTorrent"' || open -gja uTorrent /code/pre  codeopen -gj/code shows the main window if uTorrent is open but has no visible windows. codelaunch/code shows the main window if uTorrent is not open.  Programs run from crontab are run in the system security / login session. For example Mail can't access keychains if it is opened by cron.  <comment109636> I have no problems creating the plist file. In fact it is already running. My problem is the GUI window, which auto-opens upon launch and there seems to be no app-pref setting to prevent it from doing so. My core question was, if there is way to open the app without the window opening. <comment109643> Way to go...... Lauri :) <comment109644> The altered plist works like a charm! Thank you! I have one more question: **Is this correct:** the -Wa flag prevents launched to launch the app, if it is already running, effectively preventing the app to run twice? <comment109645> ...I have been checking out the [manpage for **open**](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/open.1.html), but it dosen't mention your -j flag. <comment109646> -W blocks the open command until uTorrent is terminated, so that launchd runs the open command again if uTorrent is terminated. -j was added in 10.8, and it is only shown in the help message.
