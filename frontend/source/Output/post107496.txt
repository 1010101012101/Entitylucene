Numbers has stopped showing up in Launchpad <body> Numbers has stopped showing up in Launchpad. How can I add it back?  <answer107499> Just type your application name in Launchpad's search box found near the top of every Launchpad screen. The icon for the desired App should be displayed on a new screen by itself - click and drag it to the desired location in Launchpad.  A commandline call may help as well - but be warned that it'll rebuild the Launchpad from scratch and will remove  any customizations you've added:  precode rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db; killall Dock /code/pre  <comment126068> Is it still installed in /Applications? Did you search through all pages of Launchpad? <comment126075> Yes, it's still installed in /Applications and runs properly. I performed a search within Launchpad and it's nowhere to be found. <comment126076> The Launchpad rebuild did the trick. :)
