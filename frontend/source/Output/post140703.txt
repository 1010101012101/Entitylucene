Prevent others finding me in Game Center <body> I don't want people to see me in Game Center. How can I prevent others from finding me?  People seem to locate me and I don't want them to. I would like to stay incognito but I can't find a privacy button to keep my name invisible.   <answer140710> While in Game Center open your Account and change how others can contact you (or not contact you).  See example  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oWOoy.png" alt="game center"  <comment165800> What Game Center? <comment165801> @Buscarì›ƒ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Center <comment265697> Over a year later, the "public profile" checkbox is now gone. Could you update this answer with the El Capitan equivalent?
