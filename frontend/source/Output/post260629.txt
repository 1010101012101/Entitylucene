Deleted App off Mac, but still appearing as Downloaded in App Store <body> I was working with iMovie when it started to crash. I looked to update the app, but since I downloaded it with an old Apple ID, I couldn't run the update. I tried deleting the app so that I could re-download with current Apple ID by holding it until it jiggled and clicking the X. I restarted the computer. My App Store is still saying update, rather than Install. How can I get iMovie back and working with my current apple id?!   Is there a second step to deleting the app?  I am on macOS Sierra v10.12.1  Thanks!
