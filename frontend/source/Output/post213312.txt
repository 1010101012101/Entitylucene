Open last used folder in finder <body> Often I find that I want to open the previous or last folder that I worked with in finder. Say I'm saving something to a folder from my camera, I then go to gmail and click attach, it would be great if there was a "previous" or "last folder" button that takes me to where the photos are. I'm I missing something, is there a hidden OSX feature that does this?  <answer213494> The "last folder" option can be found under strongGo/strong - strongRecent Folders/strong Finder menu. There's a list of recent folders opened in Finder not just the "last folder".  <answer213523> Additionally, if one wants to map a emspecific folder/em to a Keyboard Shortcut, this can also be done.  h3From System Preferences/h3  ul liSelect strongKeyboard/strong/li liSelect the strongShortcuts/strong tab/li liIn the Left Pane select strongApp Shortcuts/strong/li liClick the Plus Button/li liFrom the *All Applications** Drop-down, select strongFinder/strong/li liAs long as you have the desired folder in the Recent Folders menu, type in the name of the folder EXACTLY as it is named in the strongMenu Title/strong box/li liMap it with a Key combination/li /ul  Now, as long as Finder is the frontmost application, your shortcut will bring up the desired folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hee9k.png" alt="Keyboard shortcut"  <comment257537> You mean something like **Go**- **Recent Folders** in Finder menu bar? <comment257736> Yes. It seems I just had my eyes closed, when you click on the folder name in the file dialog, the drop down shows a list of recent places at the bottom. <comment257766> Interesting, would be cool if you could map a keyboard shortcut to "last folder". Sort of like the graphical equivalent of doing "cd -" in the terminal. Although "cd -" doesn't work in a new tab, it results in "OLDPWD not set"
