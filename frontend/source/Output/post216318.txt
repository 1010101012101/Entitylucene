unable to install software update in macbook <body> I am trying to install software update in macbook, but when it says downloaded completed and you need to restart your machine, I press Restart button but my machine does not restart, it just gets freezes; when I try to restart it from Apple menu it restarts but when I try to restart when software updater asks to restart it, it does not restart and blank screen appears without dock and topbar; just wallpaper appears.  I am new to Mac OS. So please help me to solve this problem and install updates successfully.  Thanks.

If the procedure done well the Mac will restart immediately.  If this doesn't work, I will try the update in Safe Boot (Boot while holding the SHIFT key, don't worry about the graphical artifacts).  <comment261349> We need more specific information about the specific update you're attempting to install in order to help you.   Your system specs show your 2008 era MacBook is running 10.6 server. If that is accurate, I would first try downloading the 10.6.8 server combo updater, installing that then see if the problem continues. ...Or is that the update that is giving you the problem?
