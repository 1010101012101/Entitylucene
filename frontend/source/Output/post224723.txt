My Mail app is eating up my space <body> When I click on General - Storage &amp; iCloud Usage - Manage Storage - Mail, The Mail and Attachments are taking up 1 GB space. But I don't have any email on my ipad. I recently tried to share a video through email which results in this change. But there seems to be no way to free up this space.  Update: Even after I deleted the video that I was trying to share, the space is still not freed.
