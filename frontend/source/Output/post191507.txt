Remove Group Names added to subject in OS X Server Mail <body> I have just finished installing OS X Server and the mail section of the installation is all done, however I have noted that when groups receive emails the groups name is placed in [ ] within the subject of the mail.  Where is the setting located to stop this or is there some form of additional code I can introduce to remove it prior to it reaching the end users inbox?
