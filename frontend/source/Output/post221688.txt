How do I remove unused partition (El Capitan)? <body> I have a partition that I no longer use. I've tried erasing with the disk utility GUI, but when I try to remove (with the '-' minus button on the partition view) this feature is disabled. I've also tried reducing the size of the unused partition and applying changes, but they don't save.  This is the out put of codediskutil list/code from the console:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal):        #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER     0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0     1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1     2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh H             68.3 GB    disk0s2     3:          Apple_CoreStorage BOOTCAMP                181.2 GB   disk0s3     4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s4 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER     0:                  Apple_HFS BOOTCAMP               +180.8 GB   disk1                              Logical Volume on disk0s3                              E4625018-24BC-4F8B-8B57-1131F79B331A                              Unencrypted /code/pre  emBOOTCAMP/em is my main storage, and I don't want to lose any data, here. emMacintosh H/em is the unused partition that I'd like to remove and add the space to emBOOTCAMP/em   <answer221691> You can't move the start block of a CoreStorage Volume Group ("BOOTCAMP" in your case) non-destructively (OK, there is a workaround: please check the strongScattered Physical Volumes method/strong at the end of my answer). The same is valid for non-CoreStorage partitions with on-board tools. AFAIK only iPartition and gparted work for the latter. Therefore you can't easily reclaim empty space with a lower start block and an arbitrary size and add it contiguously to existing CoreStorage or non-CoreStorage volumes.  You may either remove the partition emMacintosh H/em or repartition the internal drive. I recommend the latter because removing one partition strongwill not/strong increase the size of the second partition!  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liAttach a backup drive and use Time Machine to backup emBOOTCAMP/em./li liDetach the backup drive/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup. Booting to Recovery Mode is not conducive because the Recovery HD will be removed in one of the steps below. And you can't remove a partition used as a boot volume.    The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan).

After extending the Logical Volume, emBOOTCAMP/em will cover almost all of your disk. The content of emBOOTCAMP/em will be preserved.  The approach is similar to a Fusion Drive (two Physical Volumes - one Logical Volume Group/Logical Volume) however using only strongone/strong disk.  strongScattered Physical Volumes method/strong  ul liAttach a backup drive and use Time Machine to backup emBOOTCAMP/em./li liDetach the backup drive/li liRestart to Recovery Mode by pressing kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup./li liOpen Utilities - Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil list/code to list all partitions/li liEnter codediskutil cs list/code to list the CoreStorage items/li liEnter codediskutil cs addDisk lvgUUID diskYsZ/code to add a Physical Volumebr lvgUUID is the UUID of the Logical Volume Group, diskYsZ is the disk identifier of the empty partition emMacintosh H/em (probably disk0s2).

This may work for you, although it may not apply to your case. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/209350/19086  This was simpler than the alternatives, but @klanomath suggested solutions to this problem.  <comment268491> "BOOTCAMP" is the name given to the partition created by Boot Camp Assistant to which Windows is installed.  Did you at one time install Windows and then reformat that volume to HFS+? <comment268505> @bmike - yes. I forgot that I did that, but that's how I got here. <comment268506> @bmike I removed the bootcamp tag again because despite the name of the volume it's not involved. <comment268517> Cheers and thanks @klanomath - hard to derail the brain when the text matches expectations :-)
