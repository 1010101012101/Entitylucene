Application created with Script Editor ignores the selected item on the 'tell current application' popup menu <body> Consider the following AppleScript program:  precodetell the application "TextEdit" to make new document /code/pre  I saved this script as an Application, and ran it successfully by double-clicking the application icon.  I then simplified the script by setting the 'tell current application' popup menu to 'TextEdit' and replacing the program with the following line:  precodemake new document /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fVITv.png" alt="Simplified AppleScript program"  I saved the script and ran it from within Script Editor. Everything worked OK. I then ran the application by double-clicking the application icon, but now the following error message appeared:     strongCan't make class document/strongbr   Can't make class document. (-2710)   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TiJ91.png" width="420" alt="Can't make class document error message"  What is the reason for this behavior?  <answer280989> You cannot create an AppleScript application that only contains the single line of code codemake new document/code as it will not execute within the same context it does in Script Editor having made a selection from the "tell" application menu.  As an AppleScript application you need to explicitly tell the appropriate application to codemake new document/code.  Example: codetell application TextEdit to make new document/code  If you only code codemake new document/code and save it as, e.g. codeCode Test.app/code then codemake new document/code executes as codetell current application to make new document/code or more literally in this case, codetell application "Code Test" to make new document/code and the codeCode Test.app/code lacks the ability to create a new document and therefore errors out.  While in Script Editor, the "tell" application menu is a handy shortcut to avoid fully typing out codetell application .../code and is only for testing code. It is not translated to the literal code that you must be fully type so as to be fully functional within proper context to save as an application (or script for that matter).  <comment353495> Thanks. I find it to be a poor GUI design choice. In my opinion the behavior should have carried over to the application. <comment353496> @Evan Aad, I agree Script Editor is not well designed and lacks many features present in other Programing IDE's however the [AppleScript Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html) lays the foundation for how to write the code properly, regardless of what editor is used. <comment353497> What other IDEs are available for AppleScript? Are there any that you would recommend?
