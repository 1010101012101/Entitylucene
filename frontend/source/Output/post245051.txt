How long does an iPhone alarm last? <body> I lost my iphone but the alarm is still on and I want to know if the alarm turns itself off or if someone calls the iPhone will the alarm turn off.  <answer245053> The alarm will last about 15 minutes, according to Anna Fyen's answer on Quora:     My alarm works fine every weekday. I cannot give you the exact time. But one day, I set an alarm and let it ring for a while so after about 15 minutes or so of ringing it turns itself off and displays a message on the lock screen.   Phoning an iPhone currently playing the alarm will likely interrupt the alarm and replace the sound with that of the ring tone.
