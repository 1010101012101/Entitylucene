Are there any improvements in the Mavericks Terminal app? <body> Most OS X updates have included a few tweaks to the Terminal app. I know that Mavericks has upgraded a lot of command-line tools, but I haven't seen any reports of changes in Terminal.app itself. Has anyone noticed any?  <answer107075> I believe Mavericks added pwd restoration (after quitting and relaunching)  <comment125584> That was already supported in Lion. <comment125585> I’m sure I’ve read about some enhancements to Terminal in one of the Mavericks reviews that I read, but I can’t find which it was/what they were. /o\ <comment125629> Why is this marked as duplicate? The linked question has nothing to do with terminal.app <comment125631> The linked question is trying to collect all features/improvements specific to Mavericks. I agree that it does not specifically focus on Terminal alone, but let's try to keep all the Mavericks specific details in one thread.
