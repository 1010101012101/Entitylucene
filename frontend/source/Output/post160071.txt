How to start to recovery mode in a Mac OS X VM in Parallels? <body> Is it possible to start into Recovery/Internet recovery mode in a virtualized Mac OS X in Parallels?  It would come in handy to take screenshots of those UIs or running apps to exemplify some steps especially here at askdifferent.  <answer160080> I've found a way:  ol liEnable codeSelect boot device at startup/code in the virtual machine/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Ndde.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liAfter the startup of the VM press any key to enter the boot device menu/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z1vRi.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liSelect codeBoot Maintenance Manager/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mi4Mi.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="4" liSelect codeBoot from file/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5UwlK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="5" liSearch your recovery volume (usually it's the 2nd one listed)/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9cP5X.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="6" liSelect codecom.apple.recovery.boot/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/An3Y3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="7" liSelect codeboot efi/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bSQjL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="8" liRecovery mode:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/my0OW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  In Yosemite the mouse acts flaky though and i can't hoover the mouse over the menubar (e.g. to start /Utilities/Terminal) - it immediately jumps to the framing window. Menu navigation with kbdCtrl/kbdkbdF2/kbd to circumvent this malfunction doesn't work.    In Mavericks everything seems to work bug-free.  **Addendum: You may access the menubar with your pointer after enabling FileVault 2 on the VM's system drive. **
