How do I solve the Error Code -36? <body> I deleted some photos from iPhotos and Photos libraries that I should not have. I want to restore these from my Time Machine back of a couple days ago. When I do this I keep getting the following error  precodeThe Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in “Photos Library”  can’t be read or written.(Error code -36) /code/pre  Any help will be much appreciated.  <answer193907> I was able to get these files from time machine by accessing the time machine from the terminal. I used the following commands  precodesudo tmutil listbackup /code/pre  this listed all the backup directories, their names contain the date of the backup. then  precodecd &lt;to the backup I wanted&gt; /code/pre  then  precodecp -R &lt;iPhotos backup folder&gt; &lt;Pictures folder&gt; /code/pre  during this command, I did get a warning for one of the image files. My guess is that codeFinder/code cannot handle this situation.    <comment229945> Here's the official definition of that error code (word for word): "Mac OS error -36 (ioErr): I/O error (bummers)". It is indeed bummers, as Apple suggests. You may want to run a disk verify in Disk Utility. <comment229963> I have done that on both the Mac hard drive and the Time Machine disk. Still no luck.
