Bootcamp software RAID 1 <body> Today I will purchase used iMac late 2013 maxed out specs (except disc) and would like to configure my new workstation to be in strongRAID 1/strong, because it would make my life much more calm knowing there is always at least one up-to-date complete backup stored on separate disc.   I am full stack developer and I am working on around 3-4 projects at the same time, so having a good (and multiple) backups of my operating systems is a must and I only work from home. Until now I had Late 2013 MBP for my work, with Bootcamp and used external HDD disc for Time Machine backups on macOS and File History &amp; System images on Windows for Bootcamp backups.   Here is what I have:  ul li1 TB fusion drive in iMac (1TB HDD 7200 rpm + 128GB SSD)/li li512 GB SSD USB 3.0 external/li li1 TB external HDD disc for "cold storage" backups/li /ul  Here is what I want:  ul limacOS as primary OS and Bootcamp as secondary OS/li lisetup software RAID 1 for both OS/li /ul  It would be perfect if I could set iMac fusion drive to RAID 1, and use external 512 SSD disc as primary storage for macOS and Bootcamp.  But there are couple of problems to begin with:  ul liApparently Disc Utility doesn't support Windows software RAID (https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201803)/li liAlso Bootcamp "isn't supported on external drives", but I am sure there are workable workarounds (f.e. https://blog.macsales.com/40947-tech-tip-how-to-use-boot-camp-on-an-external-drive)/li lihardware RAID is not possible as I understand, because I would have to install disc into iMac for it to work/li /ul  So basically what I think of doing tomorrow:    ul liInstall macOS on external SSD drive /li liInstall Bootcamp on external SSD/li liconfigure internal Fusion drive to software RAID 1 for macOS/li lithen somehow figure out how to set Bootcamp to software RAID 1 if it's even possible /li /ul  I would like to ask if there are any "good" viable solutions for my problem and if there is anything I should pay extra attention to or if I am missing anything? I hope I gave you good enough insight on my current situation. Thanks!  <comment371628> This doesn't make much sense, hmm no, it makes **no** sense at all! RAID1 â‰  backup! Too many different techs not really tested for compatibility (SoftRAID Apple/Fusion Drive/BootCamp/SoftRAID Windows) and too complex. This surely won't work with the default BootCamp Assistant workflow - you would have to use some VBox/VMware Fusion raw disk work-arounds. Finally: if one of the RAID1 slices fail it's almost impossible to recreate it properly by replacing it with an extra slice/drive! <comment371680> @klanomath yeah I am still considering option to do backups just the normal way, becouse it has low if any chances of working as it should even with modifications. To complex becouse of different configurations and enviroments.
