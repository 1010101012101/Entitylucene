Make ls command sort by file type (e.g. directories and file extension) <body> How do I make codels/code sort by file type (e.g. directories first and then by file extension)? The answers suggested in (Super User) Make ls sort by file type result in unknown option errors from codels/code.  <answer39920> As you've found out, the Darwin version of the codels/code command doesn't support the code-X | --sort=extension/code option. This option is unique to the GNU version of codels/code.  You can obtain the GNU version of codels/code for your system. The easiest way to do this is through the Homebrew package manager and porting system. With Homebrew installed do:  precodebrew install coreutils /code/pre  to add the GNU Core Utilities package to your system. All the utilities will be prefixed with codeg/code so they don't collide with the default Darwin utils that OS X ships with.  With the GNU Core Utilites installed you can now do:  precodegls -X /code/pre  And you'll see the output sorted as you desire.  If you want to use the GNU Core Utils instead of the utilities that come with OS X you can put the following line in your code~/.bashrc/code file:  precodesource /usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/8.14/aliases /code/pre  And you won't need to use the codeg/code prefix on the commands any more. I'll say this isn't an entirely safe thing to do as some of the GNU utils differ from the bash built-ins and Darwin tools in how they behave, enough so that they might screw up other things in your shell session. So do this with caution.  <answer39956> Based on an answer in the linked Super User article:  precodels -l |sort -d -k 1.1,1.1r -k 9 | cut -c 50- /code/pre  If you want to see the whole output of codels -l/code, just leave out the codecut/code part.  <comment45102> Minor correction regarding your title: ls isn't a bash command; it's a standalone executable located at `/bin/ls` .
