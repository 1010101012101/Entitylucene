Dock disappearing on Mac <body> Why does the Dock disappear on my Mac? It pops back up when I put the cursor to the bottom of the screen but does not stay there permanently any longer.  <answer124250> You've probably enabled Dock hiding. strongYou can toggle this by pressing ⌥⌘D/strong.  Alternatively, you can toggle it through System Preferences or by right-clicking the spacer between the apps and the stacks then turning Hiding off:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3GDRO.png" width="230"  <answer168523> For me, I don't remember turning Hiding On, but I must have done it inadvertently.  When I tried toggling it off, it fixes this problem.  <comment168211> I did not enable hiding.. it just disappears <comment197820> Welcome to Ask Different! Please don't add "thank you" as an answer.

I've edited this into an answer.. <comment212210> This worked perfectly for me. My dock settings in system preferences weren't set to hidden, but I must have hit ⌥⌘D without realizing it, because hitting ⌥⌘D again solved the problem. Thanks!
