Google Drive doesn't appear on my Finder <body> I can see Dropbox but I can't find Google Drive on my Finder. If I want to sync a file to GDrive, I have to open the folder GDrive by click on the symbol of Gdrive. It's very inconvenient.   I'm wondering if there is a way to display GDrive on the Finder, just like where Dropbox is?  <answer158058> It's most definitely in your home folder(username), that's where strongemGoogle Drive/em/strong folder is found just like strongemDropbox./em/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jl0Yt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer158064> I guess that by "if there is a way to display GDrive on the Finder, just like where Dropbox is" you mean to display it in a sidebar, right?  To do that, just go to your home folder (/Users/[username]) and ... drag and drop Google Drive folder to sidebar.  <answer165190> I had the same question, and just figured this out for my older macbook.  My User wasn't on the Favorites bar, either.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K653R.png" alt="enter image description here"   A) On the Finder menu, click "Finder", then click "Preferences"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S37iV.png" alt="enter image description here"  B) Click the "Sidebar" icon, then choose the box next to your User  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WqJzB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer184510> OSX 10.10 Yosemite After downloading and dragging to Applications I went to the applications folder and ran the install, the Google Drive location appeared in my finder at the end of the installation  <answer262625> Go to your application folder. click on google drive to open it. then in the top menu from the finder click FILEADD TO SIDEBAR.  <comment185923> That's what I want to do.
