How to type in Cantonese in OS X? <body> In emSystem Preferences/em | emKeyboard/em | emInput Sources/em, you can add any languages you like by tapping kbd+/kbd button. The list contains Simplified and Traditional language, but it doesn't have Cantonese.  I wonder why it does not contain Cantonese, even though it has some too minor languages like Telugu, Oriya, or even Ainu.  Is it still possible to type in Cantonese in OS X, with possibly pinyin?  <answer245057> You can use 3rd party input method named "RIME".  ol liYou can download RIME by goto: http://rime.im//li liUnzip downloaded file and run Installation./li liAfter install was successfully, you need to login your account again./li liClick on Squirrel Input Method icon (on top menu) and choose codeSettings.../code./li liYou will see list of setting files, open file named codedefault.yaml/code and edit like below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A5yBj.png" alt=""/li liAfter editing, save file and close./li liClick on codeSquirrel/code icon then choose codeDeploy/code./li liYou now can type Cantonese! codezuk nei cing gung/code - 祝你成功/li /ol  Sorry I can attach only one photo.  <comment236779> [**This site**](http://blog.theoryspace.com/2009/01/05/how-to-type-chinese-on-a-mac-with-cantonese-pinyin/) may help you figure this out. <comment236780> Not sure if this will be of any help however have a look at: [FCIM — a Cantonese Phonetic Input Method](http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi/articles/FCIM-a-cantonese-phonetic-input-method/)
