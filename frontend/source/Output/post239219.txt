Upgrade iPhone to no longer current version of iOS <body> I have an iPhone 5 currently running iOS 8.2 I'd like to upgrade to 8.4 because there are some apps I want to install that require it. I would emnot/em like to upgrade to iOS 9 because I've had more than enough problems in the past with upgrading older devices with major version OS changes. Is there a way to do that?  Update: I found a few sites that let me download ISPW files for either 8.4 or 8.4.1, but none of them work for me. I download it then try to open it in iTunes using either the Update or Restore button (I saw conflicting information on which one to use), but either way it says "This device isn't eligible for the requested build". This is on a Mac running iTunes 12. Is my iTunes too new to install this older OS from?  <comment293559> Is your iPhone 5 a GSM or CDMA model? <comment293711> I did some searching but most of the links I found (including the related question) ask specifically about downgrading, and it was far from obvious to me that upgrading to a no longer current version was effectively equivalent to downgrading. Hopefully someone with a similar query is able to find this question in the future.
