Rewrite 'eject remove' command <body> I used the commands:  codedefaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject true/code andbr codesudo defaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject true/code (as stated on this page - Remove eject button from finder)  The command prevented the 'eject' button from working, however i want to undo this command...  Can someone rewrite the command to undo this, so that my eject button can work again?  <answer260072> To reverse any Boolean command, just type the inverse property, so...  true becomes false, one becomes zero  codedefaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject false/code  codesudo defaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject false/code  <comment325482> Try `false` instead <comment325484> Thanks for that... Is there any way to stop eject from working on one drive. I have a SD card that i use for storage and i keep accidentally pressing eject on it... So is there any method to prevent the eject from working on that drive? <comment325485> I didn't know Eject would affect anything other than the DVD tray. it doesn't here. SD cards, RAM disks, external drives all must be right-click/ejected, or Cmd/E
