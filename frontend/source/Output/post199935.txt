Is there a Windows 7/8/8.1 like automatic window sizer? <body> so I got a Macbook Pro a few months ago to use for coding and as a DAW. Really the only thing I miss about Windows 8.1 is the ability to drag a window to the upper left or upper right corner and have it automatically resized to take up the half the screen. Is there an option in Yosemite like this, or a tool I can download? Found it to be a real time saver as opposed to fiddling with height and width.  <answer199936> BetterTouchTool has one of the features u are looking for.  You can find it in Window Snapping Settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/52i1b.png" alt="Window Snapping Settings in Better Touch Tool"  <answer199937> The next major version of OS X, 10.11 "El Capitan", will include such functionality. If you can't wait until then, there are several third party products, e.g. Moom, Divvy, Breeze, but you'll likely find others as well. An alternative might be ShiftIt, a free tool, but it works with keyboard short cuts instead of dragging a window with the mouse.
