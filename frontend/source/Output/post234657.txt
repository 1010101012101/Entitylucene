Not able to install apps after update to iOS 9.3.1 <body> I have upgraded my iPhone OS to 9.3.1. Since then, I am not able to install apps to my phone from iTunes.  I have latest iTunes version 12.3.3.17 and OS X 10.11.4.  Has anyone else faced this issue / found any solutions?  <comment286918> Can you provide more details than "not able to install"? <comment287013> Could you please explain details? Is it same issue with me? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/234747/not-able-to-install-ipa-via-itunes-after-updating-to-ios-9-3-1
