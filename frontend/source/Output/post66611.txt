How to change computer name so terminal displays it in Mac OS X Mountain Lion? <body> When I setup my computer I named it "Scott's MacBook Pro". And so when I go to System preferences-Sharing, it says Scott's MacBook Pro there as my computer name. However, opening up a terminal gives me this prompt:  precodeLast login: Sun Oct  7 11:02:49 on ttys003 new-host-4:~ scott$  /code/pre  When I login to Backblaze, they list my computer as "new‑host‑4_2012_10_07". Did I not fully set my computer name? Should I use the traditional codehostname/code command?  <answer66613> You can define what you want to see before the code$/code in your terminal by modifying the file code~/.profile/code.  For example if you add to the file code~/.profile/code the following line:  precode# h is the host name, w the complete path  export PS1="\h:\w$ " /code/pre  you will see the host name and the complete path of the current directory:  precodehost_name:current_directory_path$ /code/pre  You can also modify my example by using the following options in the export command:  precode\d – Current date \t – Current time \h – Host name \# – Command number \u – User name \W – Current working directory (i.e: Desktop/) \w – Current working directory, full path (i.e: /Users/Admin/Desktop) /code/pre  <answer67006> I didn't do anything to my computer, but eventually for some reason the hostname and computer name all registered as the name I initially set! In fact I had the following terminal open the whole time and this is exactly a cut and paste:  precodenew-host-4:~ scott$ hostname new-host-4.home new-host-4:~ scott$ hostname Scotts-MacBook-Pro.local /code/pre  <answer71430> In my case, I found that it was a problem with our DNS server, as the reverse DNS lookup didn't scavenge because there was duplicate DNS entries for the IP address and hostname.  <answer79055> I am adding an answer here because I have recently run into this problem as well.  In OSX 10.7.4 and possibly prior, there appears to be a bug in the Edit Hostname option in the Sharing preference panel.  It sets the hostname to the last thing set instead of the current this set.  I had to run codesudo hostname [preferred hostname]/code in order to set it correctly, after setting it in Sharing.  <answer81437> You can run  precodesudo hostname Name-Of-My-Computer /code/pre  in Terminal to change the name.  <answer83801> For those who are not looking for a command line solution, you can change it under  precodeSystem Preferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; Computer Name:  /code/pre  <answer86545> If you use:   precodesudo scutil --set HostName name-you-want /code/pre  it will work a bit better. From the scutil(8) man page:   precode--get pref     Retrieves the specified preference.  The current value will be     reported on standard output.      Supported preferences include:           ComputerName   The user-friendly name for the system.           LocalHostName  The local (Bonjour) host name.           HostName       The name associated with hostname(1) and gethostname(3).  --set pref [newval]     Updates the specified preference with the new value.  If the new value is not     specified on the command line then it will be read from standard input.      Supported preferences include: ComputerName LocalHostName HostName      The --set option requires super-user access. /code/pre   <answer90873> After following Jeffrey J. Hoover's tip,  precodesudo scutil --set ComputerName "newname" sudo scutil --set LocalHostName "newname" sudo scutil --set HostName "newname" /code/pre  I would add these last two steps.    ul liFlush the DNS cache by typing: codedscacheutil -flushcache/code/li liRestart your Mac. /li /ul  EDIT: It didn't work for me until I restarted my mac.   <comment78449> To my knowledge this is what DNS reports it to be.  If your IP-number does not have a name, the name from Preferences is used (perhaps the `.local` domain)) <comment78450> Why -1? He said that he cannot see its host name in the Terminal. <comment78457> @ThorbjørnRavnAndersen - my .local domain from the Sharing preferences has been scotts-macbook-pro.local <comment78459> wasn't me with the -1 :). Thank you for your answer, I guess I'm not just looking for how to change my name in the terminal, but clearly my computer is still referenced by the new-host-4 ugly name as services like Backblaze use it. My previous MacBook Pro had a nicer name that I chose, I don't know why my mountain lion MacBook Pro isn't using the name I have in the Sharing preferences <comment93896> The man page for hostname says to run `scutil --set HostName name-of-host` if you want to keep the hostname across reboots <comment165244> Worked for me after running that command and rebooting Terminal. <comment167113> Are you a former Windows user, carrying over the practice of rebooting after every little change, or do you actually have evidence that it's necessary to restart? <comment167242> @iconoclast  Last used Windows primarily in 2004. Restarting worked for me and 16 other people.  Wouldn't hurt. <comment167243> Meaning it didn't work until you restarted?  (Restarting ***can*** hurt when you actually do serious work on your computer, and therefore have lots of applications open.  Getting everything back how you had it before reboot can be a *****.) Also, the fact that 16 people found some part of your answer helpful doesn't mean nothing worked until they restarted. <comment167244> Yes, it didn't work until I restarted. Thanks for the info; didn't know it can be harmful. <comment167981> Worked for me without restarting, just quit Terminal completely and re-open. <comment168840> I first used `scutil --get` to discover that `ComputerName` and `LocalHostName` had been correctly set by using System Preferences (Sharing). However, it told me that `HostName` was `not set`. Thus, I just used `sudo scutil --set` in order to set `HostName`. Then, I didn't need to use `dscacheutil` or do a reboot as immediately a check of `hostname` showed that things were fixed for me and opening a new Terminal tab showed my prompt was now fixed too. (OS X 10.9.4) <comment169933> This didn't work for me. The name at terminal command prompt still remained as `localhost` <comment182263> For me it worked very well, even restarting the computer. Thank You. <comment197346> You shouldn't even need to restart terminal to reflect the changes, just source the configuration responsible for your prompt. <comment267128> This worked for me after I restarted my Mac (running El Capitan) <comment284820> Did you restart the terminal? <comment347292> Worked as charm
