iphone showing different behavious for different WiFi devices <body> I have two WiFi wearable devices. Both can act as access point. When I connect my iphone to both the devices the behavior is different.   When I am connected to device 1, the preferred network is WiFi:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sbKPA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And when I am connected to the device 2, the preferred network is Cellular data:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lkpvZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  As both the devices do not provide internet access, I always want the preferred network to be cellular. But this is not happening in device 1. So I am not able to access internet in device 1.  Please let me know where the issue is.  Issue seen in iphone 5s with ios 8.3.  <comment270539> Can you check if both devices distribute not only a IP/Broadcast via DHCP, instead also a router and DNS address? Otherwise I would try a network reset first. <comment270743> @frdmn Connection info for both devices are [Device1](http://imgur.com/1SIbDj4), [Device2](http://imgur.com/UKN44Bh)  Basically what I am seeing is that Device 1 provides DNS, Device 2 does not. Can this be the reason Device 1 is given preferred status? <comment270766> Exactly. As far as I know you need a working internet connection (which a DNS server is needed to) for the WiFi symbol to show up! That's why it prefers the first network connection.
