Will this memory fit into my MacBook Pro? <body> I'm planning to upgrade my MacBook Pro with another 4GB memory. How do I know which memory is compatible with my MacBook?  I got MacBook Pro model A1278, processor 2.3 GHZ Intel Core i5, current memory 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3. Would this memory fit into my hardware?  <answer146933> I have here two helpful Links for you:  Apple Support Serial Number &amp; Apple Support Memory Upgrade  I don't have experience with this memory, but i emthink/em it should work ;) But please use the provided Links and double check everything. I don't know how it is in Jp but in Europe you can send the RAM back to Amazon if it does not work. "Normally" a wrong RAM is not warming you Macbook.   I hope this will help you and sorry if we can't provide for every RAM Module Experience ;)  <answer146937> Your question seems to have invalid data. There is no A1287 MBP model. There are A1286, A1297, A1278 and A1286. Would you please clarify? I would be happy to help with the correct information. (There are others, but those are the closest IDs to what you wrote.)  MacBook Pro A1278 configurations are as follows:  13" Mid-2009 Max 8 GB RAM PC3-8500 1066 MHz MacBookPro5,5  13" Mid-2010 Max 16 GB RAM PC3-8500 1066 MHz MacBookPro7,1  13" Early-2011 Max 16 GB RAM PC-10600 1333 MHz MacBookPro8,1  13" Late-2011 Max 16 GB RAM PC-10600 1333 MHz MacBookPro8,1  13" Mid-2012 Max 16 GB RM PC3-12800 1600 MHz MacBookPro9,2  You can use the System Information app in Applications | Utilities to determine which of the MacBookPro models you have. From there, it should be easy for you to determine compatible memory.  This information was all gleaned from Mactracker, a free download from the App Store.  <answer146939> Crucial is a trusted and renowned company which sells memory sticks and SSD drives at affordable prices. On their front page you can use the Crucial Advisor Tool, if you know the system specs, or download the Crucial System Scanner, which will scan your system for compatible upgrades.  They guarantee 100% compatibility on either tool.     Using either tool guarantees compatibility when you order on Crucial.com    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pB7cU.png" alt="Crucial Snapshot"  strongDisclaimer/strong: I ordered from them in the past and I can recommend their service as a customer, but you can just use the tools and order from a third party.  <comment173163> Spot on, I mistyped. Please check the updated question! <comment173164> Thanks for the link, it's really educative. According to the page, it seems that I need a memory with "PC3-10600 DDR3 1333" for my MacBook Pro, early 2011. Gotta look for another memory with the same spec just to be sure!
