iPhoto vs Photo stream vs Image capture <body> What is the difference between iPhoto/Photo Stream/ Image Capture?  I hope, all the three is using photos. But WHAT is the difference?   <answer61596> strongiPhoto/strong is a digital photograph manipulation software, part of the iLife suite.  strongPhoto Stream/strong is functionality by which when you take a photo on one device, it will automatically appear on all your other devices, without syncing nor sending.   strongImage Capture/strong is the Application developed by Apple which enables users to upload pictures from digital cameras, scanners, or iDevices.  <comment71130> Thanks for the reply. I simply want to do the following things. 1. Just want to copy photos from iPhone 2. Just want to copy photos to iPhone 3. Delete the photos when I want.   So, which one (iPhoto or Image capture) should I use to achieve my requirement? <comment71133> I'd use iPhoto with Photo Stream. You'll require a Wifi connection, though. You should take a look at Dropbox, or any other cloud storage, too.
