Hard Drives shows up in Finder, but not Desktop <body> In the past when I have plugged in external hard-drives they would always show up on the desktop. I'm not sure if it is because of a software update or the drive itself but it's no longer showing up.  The drive is working because if I go to Finder I can access the drive.  How can I change the settings so that drives show up on the desktop when they are plugged in?  I'm using OSX version: 10.7.3.  <answer50006> You probably have accidentally unchecked "Hard disks" from the Finder Preference pane (accessible with kbdâŒ˜/kbd +  kbd,/kbd ). Just check the box,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHlzZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  and you should be good to go!
