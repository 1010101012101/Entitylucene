How can I crop a video? <body> How does one remove a black border around a video. The input video has the size 720x576 and has the output video should be 720x480. I need to crop away 96 pixels from top and bottom.  I have gazed through this list of video tools for Mac, but I'm unsure which tools can do this. I have tried MPEG Streamclip and avidemux2, but they doesn't seem capable of it.  Preferable a free tool.  <answer7969> Aha, in MPEG Streamclip if you select Export as mp4, there is a strongcrop/strong checkbox and some textfields where you can type in the number of pixels to be cropped.  <answer33219> If you are using MacBook or iMac the best app is iMovie.  ol liCreate new project in iMovie/li liImport video to iMovie and then drag and drop it in your new project/li liSelect you video in project and use crop button in preview window/li liExport your new video and use it/li /ol  If it is a large file that you need a small part of then first trim the video by pressing command+t when the file is opened in quicktime. Import time to iMovie will decrease by a lot  <answer153747> It's kind of hacky, and probably not the best answer but works if you don't want to download any other tools and just use quicktime, and since I love hacks...  ol liOpen video in Quicktime./li liSelect new screen recording from file menu./li liSetup audio source to be built in input from the arrow next to the record button./li liAfter pressing the record button, Select the area you want to record (instead of doing full screen) in the original video./li liStart the recording./li liStart the original movie playback./li liWhen original movie finishes stop the recording by clicking the Stop button in the menu bar./li /ol  <comment8639> Take a look at [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/) as well, even though it sounds you've solved the issue. <comment37902> Welcome to Ask Different! Can you add more detail to this answer? How do you crop a movie using iMovie? Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment37973> 1- Create new project in iMovie. 2- Import video to iMovie and then drag and drop it in your new project. 3- select you video in project and use crop button in preview window. 4- export your new video and use it. <comment59483> Yeah, iMovie is great if you want to spend 15 minutes waiting for it to generate thumbnails across a 30 minute movie that you only want to extract 30 seconds from. <comment142109> I imported a 30 secs 2880x1080 video and no way to get the crop button enabled. It is greyed. Maverick <comment241403> Handbrake automatically crops the black bars off of a recording. Works wonderfully: https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/PictureSettings <comment290099> In my case with iMovie 10.1.1, the crop tool won't let you change the aspect ratio - ie. if you want to remove 10% from the top, it'll also remove 10% from the side.  Please post if you know a way around that. <comment372164> So I took a screen recording of a screen recording today. I don't get why Quicktime doesn't support cropping natively.
