Opening shared playlist links (Apple Music - Android) <body> I have apple music on android. A friend shared an apple music playlist link to me over snapchat and when I click it, I get sent to the google playstore even though I have it installed.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cm7a0.png" alt="I am sent to this link which redirects me to the playstore and I&#39;ve tried all instructions provided here as well"
