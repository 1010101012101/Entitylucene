How do I delete Time Machine backups of my Trash? <body> Time Machine (external hard drive) backed up some files in my Trash folder and I'd like them removed from my backup. I know how to normally remove backed up files from within Time Machine (right click a file and choose codeDelete Backup/code), but that method is not working for ~/Trash and ~/.trash in the backups.  How do I removed backed up files from the Trash in Time Machine?  <answer132363> Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but Time Machine does not backup the Trash folder by default. Did you modify the exclusions property list to include these folders?  <answer132364> Time Machine shouldn't be backing up the trash folder(s) under normal circumstances.  In any case, you might want to use Terminal command codetmutil delete/code command to delete the offending files.  precodetmutil delete /Volumes/DISK/Backups.backupdb/HOST/DATE/Macintosh HD/.Trashes /code/pre  <answer132431> The fix to the problem isâ€¦ it fixed itself. Really. Between posting this problem and trying a solution I had disconnected my backup drive and put my laptop to sleep.  When I reconnected the backup drive later to try @icondaemon's solution, it turned out then that I couldn't find the files in the backup. I was very thorough in checking. Moreover, the Finder/Time Machine was now letting me delete backups of dot files and hidden flag files.  So I'm happy now that it's taken care of, but a bit tired and confused since there is no obvious solution.  <comment155624> What's that method that you mention and does not work? <comment155631> Thecafremo - Perhaps @CyberSkull alludes to the inability in Time Machine to manipulate the invisible Trash folders because the Finder UI is the only mechanism available to the user. <comment155656> Whoever downvoted, an explanation as to why would be useful. Otherwise, it's just pure ignorance. <comment155659> I'll up vote almost any relevant link to pondini on Time Machine, so +1 for me. <comment155667> @bmike Thanks - that 74K reputation carries a lot of weight with it :). RIP James Pond - the definitive TM expert in my book. <comment155668> @bmike not too get too off topic, are you over at Apple Support Communities as well? <comment155721> I did answer a ton of questions on [Apple's Discussions](https://discussions.apple.com/people/Michael%20Bradshaw) before this site spun up and before I worked for Apple. It looks like they've made it much better and often really good content is discovered / uncovered there over here, but I find it much more useful here due to community editing and the standards about not hijacking Q&A. <comment155722> @bmike Thanks for the reply... can we continue discussion in [chat] <comment155727> I told the Finder to show hidden items, but it only shows the restore command for hidden items, delete is not listed. <comment155737> I forgot `tmutil` even existed. It does report that my trash folder is excluded, though it also is undeniably also backed up. <comment155738> So ... does tmutil delete the erroneous Trash folder? Inquiring minds want to know. <comment155746> For the ultimate resolution to the problem, see my post. I'm still marking this as the "most correct" answer, as it provides a great deal of utility.
