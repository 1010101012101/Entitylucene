It offers convenient downloads managing, flexible settings,   etc. Folx has a unique system of sorting and keeping the downloaded   content.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/biroh.jpg" alt="Folx Screenshot"  ul liiGetter: /li /ul     iGetter is a full featured download manager and accelerator. With   iGetter you can get the most out of your Internet connection be it   dial-up, wireless, cable, DSL, T1 and other high end broadband   connections. iGetter can greatly improve the speed of your downloads   using segmented (accelerated) downloading.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j3ETu.jpg" alt="iGetter Screemshot"  ul liLeech (paid one) : clean UI./li /ul     Every modern browser has its own download functionality, so why should   you use a separate application for handling downloads in the first   place? Because Leech works better than any built-in download manager.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1OEW5.jpg" alt="Leech"  ul lijDownloader 2/li /ul     JDownloader is a free, open-source download management tool with a   huge community of developers that makes downloading as easy and fast   as it should be. Users can start, stop or pause downloads, set   bandwith limitations, auto-extract archives and much more. It's an   easy-to-extend framework that can save hours of your valuable time   every day!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFqo7.png" alt="jDownloader"  - Fat Pipe: (free)     Most servers and internet service providers limit the speed a single   connection can have. We can bypass these limits by splitting a   download task up into many smaller chunks. This guarantees that you   will fully saturate your internet connection.   http://fatpipeapp.com/media/demo.mp4  <answer1113> I highly recommended you use iGetter it was better than other one.  ul liiGetter/li /ul  but also can use  ul liDownload Accelerator Plus (DAP)/li liFolx (free) but can pay money and upgrade it to pro/li /ul  Also if you can use terminal and install package I recommended you use AXEL I myself use this one. after install it you can use this like below in terminal  precodeaxel -n 100 -s 5242880 "your download link" /code/pre  the -n 100 show the number of your connection to the server   and the -s 5242880 use for limiting the speed,-s 5242880 in above example will try to keep the average speed around 5242880 (5120 Kilobyte per/sec).  <answer1277> I use JDownloader a lot. It is extremely useful if you're downloading content from the cloud (to name the popular one: Rapidshare, Hotfile, Megaupload).   And it's free.  <answer13664> As much as this saddens me but I would also recommend jDownloader. On the other hand for some simple and not so simple cases you could opt for wget or curl. You could be evan braver and create a batch script using one of those UNIX commands and be done with it.  <answer87322> Let's not forget DownThemAll for Firefox. Yes, it's a plug-in for Firefox, but since Firefox also runs on the Mac, this makes it a valid answer. It's free too.  <answer135388> strongFat Pipe/strong - (free) has plugins for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzsda.png" alt="Fat Pipe App"  emnote: I am extremely biased (i wrote fat pipe);/em  I used to use Speed Download but they recently stopped supporting their app and i was getting a bunch of errors.  Fat Pipe actually supports up to 50 connections per download and automatically determines connection count based on file size.  <answer162899> Aria2 bundled with WebUI is the best you can get on OS X.

This question was asked 4 years ago, I know, but Download Managers are useless in today's world.  Need a download manager still? Your browser. Done!  <comment14546> This should probably be a comment since your answer is the same as nanda. Also, I think you mean `bash` not `batch` script. <comment14793> You are absolutely right, just an old habit from MS DOS times:) <comment160473> Welcome to Ask Different!

Scheduling, download bandwidth adjustments, resume capabilities, BitTorrent features, remote control, and many other hacks are features that will not included in browsers.
