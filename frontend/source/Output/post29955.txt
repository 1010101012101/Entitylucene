Is there an application for sharing wi-fi passwords? <body> There are a lot of public wi-fi networks (diners, restaurants, cafes, universities). They are password protected. The password rarely (if ever) changes (only mcdonalds prints a temp password on the receipt).  I'm so very tired of asking for the password. I need to find a waiter. Sometimes they tell you a password that is not correct. Means I have to ask again.  strongIs there an application that shares wi-fi passwords between different people?/strong   strongFor example/strong, someone goes to Joe's Cafe, gets the wi-fi password from the waitress, and in the background (ideally) an application puts the password on a server. Then another guy/gal enters the cafe and automatically has the password from the same server and connects, to the wi-fi without having to talk to the waitress.  Thanks,  <answer30349> I've searched in the iOS AppStore. I didn't find such an application. I also looked in Cydia, but no such application exists. Android's Market also said no.  strongHere are my thoughts on why such an application does not exist/strong:  ol liSharing someone else's wifi password is an issue. He/she gave it to you so you can have internet. He/she hasn't agreed that you share it with the world. In the case of internet cafes, they have passwords so that only clients can use their wi-fi./li liI spoke with an company that develops iOS applications. They said no public API exists that allows the application to get saved wi-fi passwords or to make the phone connect to a new wi-fi network./li liSuch an application most probably will not be accepted in the iOS AppStore (I have been told from the same company)/li liThere are issues with implementation. How without an internet would one get the password that is needed for a concrete wi-fi network? Preload all passwords in the application? Use 3g to get that specific password?/li /ol  strongEven though I think such an application would make people's lives a bit easier, I think there are too many problems for it to be implemented./strong  <comment34369> How would the application get WiFi password if it's not yet connected to the internet? <comment34371> "The password rarely (if ever) changes" Then just save it to your kaychain. Next time you select that network on your device, you won't need to re-enter it. I believe iOS does this by default to any network you "remember" (log into at least once). Not understanding what the problem is. <comment34812> @Peter, there are two possible solutions for this: 1) preload all passwords from a server. 2) use 3g for a second to get the desired password. <comment34814> @cksum, you are correct. But I want to share passwords between users. If you enter a cafe and get the password from the waitress, I want an application that shares the password to my phone without me having to ask the waitress. <comment34829> Nothing (besides time and know how) stops you from creating a web site for sharing Wi-Fi passwords. You can even start with a shared Google spreadsheet and extend this if/when access volume raises. <comment34856> @patrix This is even harder than asking the waitress. The solution must be easy to use
