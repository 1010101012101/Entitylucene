MacBook Pro 2017 SSD write speed slow <body> I just bought a new MacBook Pro 2017 (no TouchBar) a month ago. I have run a speed test with Blackmagic Disk Speed Test application. The result is in image below. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kKJmd.png" alt="Blackmagic test result"  I think SSD write speed is a little slower than normal. Anyone can help me with this? Thanks so much.  <answer290722> Im also getting very slow speeds with my MacBook Pro 2015 SSD. It is most likely something wrong with the app, in the past I got much faster with the same app on a older version with the same Mac.  <comment366712> Are you running the latest version of Disk Speed Test? Prior versions don't support the 2016/2017 MacBook Pros properly. <comment366717> The *10 Bit YUV 4:2:2 2160* with 30 is really slow. Me on my bike (**no** pedelec) I have a 3 min average of ~37 (street, sunny day). <comment366722> @grgarside I have downloaded newest version from Mac App Store. It's version is 3.1. <comment366723> @klanomath So I wonder why? :( <comment366999> Thank for your answer. If that is application issue, I will change to another benchmark app. <comment373658> Maybe MBP nTB and MBP TB are different in SSD Speed? Your MBP has also TDP limitation at 15 watts vs. 28 W on MBP with TouchBar, and has one fan vs. two in MBP with TouchBar.
