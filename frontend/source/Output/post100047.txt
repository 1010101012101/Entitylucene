Awful Network Performance <body> I have a MacBook pro running Mountain Lion. When I copy files over the local network, I get around 200Kb/s on a 1Gbps link (the light on the switch indicates 1Gbps). This morning I went to download the XCode 5 DP6 and was pretty apalled by 50Kb/s. Downloading from a Windows 8 machine connected to the same switch yields 2.2Mb/s.  I've tried running the following, but is there anything else I could try?  precodesudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=0 /code/pre  <answer100066> Several things:  Do a TCP Dump to analyze traffic, to see if you're machine is hitting sites that are bogging it down. At the command line, type codesudo tcpdump -i en1/code  Do a DNS cache reset. At the command line, type codesudo dscacheutil -flushcache/code  Check the MTU settings. Confirm with your ISP what the MTU setting should be, and then go to codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Network/code. Find your connection and click codeAdvanced/code. Find the codeHardware/code tab, and enter the MTU setting manually if it does not match.
