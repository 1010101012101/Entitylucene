How do I get Web Sharing back on Mountain Lion? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Enabling Apache in Mac OS X Mountaion Lion       Like the title says but with a twist.  I DO NOT want to use localhost, but my internal IP instead so I don't want to use all the tutorials I have seen to restart/configure Apache from the command line to get localhost working. strongReason:/strong  I need the IP to test through multiple devices on my network. With localhost, this is just not possible per every device.  Thanks,  Marco  <answer68323> You could look into using MAMP, as it's just as easy as Web Sharing was before.  <comment79345> Your twist is irrelevant, Apache listens to all IP addresses on your machine by default. If you have a specific problem configuring Apache once it is running, please rephrase your question to address that. <comment79428> I got it to work. Problem was I needed to uncomment:  LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so  Now it works like a charm with my IP, etc the way it was :) <comment79429> I do, but this one I use for Wordpress :) THANKS!!! <comment79480> Why wouldn't MAMP work for WordPress?
