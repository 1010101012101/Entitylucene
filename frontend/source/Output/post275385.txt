AppleScript error when attempting to delete empty albums in Photos.app <body> h1The Problem/h1  I’m trying to delete a bunch of empty albums using AppleScript.  I have verified that I am “getting”/“collecting”/whatever-appropriate-terms-you-prefer the correct albums.  But when I try to delete these empty albums, I get an error along these lines:  precodeerror "Can’t make item 1 of every album of  folder id \"wFSS4tONSgyq4NWwnUthVA\" of folder id \"6Aod8RunTj+3Nsz2jmM1xA\"  into type integer." number -1700 from item 1 of every album of folder id "wFSS4tONSgyq4NWwnUthVA" of folder id "6Aod8RunTj+3Nsz2jmM1xA" to integer /code/pre  The same error occurs whether I try to delete the empty albums while I am looping through my albums and checking whether each one is empty, or if I collect the empty albums into a list and use a second loop to delete the albums in the list.  What is going on?  The documentation clearly states “only albums and folders can be deleted”.    h1My Code/h1  precoderepeat with project_folder in PROJECTS_SUBFOLDERS     --log "PROJECT FOLDER: " &amp; project_folder's name &amp; ¬     --"\nID: " &amp; project_folder's id      if (count of project_folder's albums) is greater than 0 then         --log "\n"         --log project_folder's name as text         --log project_folder's id as text         --log ""          repeat with abm in project_folder's albums             --log "Class: " &amp; abm's class as text             --log "Album: " &amp; abm's name as text             --log "ID: " &amp; abm's id as text              if (count of abm's media items) is equal to 0 then                 --log (count of abm's media items)                 log abm's name as text                 set the end of empty_albums to abm             end if         end repeat     end if end repeat   log "now, to delete..."  repeat with abm in empty_albums     log "Deleting " &amp; abm's name as text     delete album abm       -- (I have also tried `delete abm` without success) end repeat  return /code/pre  This code is the 2-loop method, but the same occurs if I try to delete empty albums without collecting them into a list first.  Can somebody please tell me what’s going on?!  Can anybody tell me how to get this script to run successfully?  <answer275392> The solution is to change:  precodedelete abm -- or delete album abm /code/pre  To this:  precodedelete album id (abm's id) /code/pre  Nothing in library documentation would have lead me to this answer.  I was just trying anything out of desperation.    <comment358840> is it for photo app on Mac or iPad/iphone?
