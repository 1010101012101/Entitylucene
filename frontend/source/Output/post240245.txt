checking path capitalization of pwd <body> Is there a quick way to check in terminal that the terminal command codepwd/code returns the correct capitalization of the path?  Note that if you do codecd ~/desktop/code then codepwd/code would tell you that your path is code/Users/foo/desktop/code rather than the correct code/Users/foo/Desktop/code.  EDIT: Motivation: build systems need a way to check this early on, otherwise it's really hard to debug. An unsuspecting user uses a wrong capitalisation, starts a build, gets errors that are very puzzling.  EDIT2: Silently accepting incorrectly capitalised input for codecd/code is the emstandard/em behaviour of codebash/code on an HFS+ file system, and thus for the vast majority of OSX users. Then, codepwd/code is a codebash/code builtin, and it simply takes the content of the path stack of the shell (typos included).  <answer240328> Use code/bin/pwd/code  precodecd ~/desktop /bin/pwd -P /code/pre  <comment295251> Why would you not want to do `cd ~/Desktop` then `pwd` would tell you `/Users/user/Desktop/` <comment295275> this is to make a build system more robust. I'll edit the question with more details <comment295278> 1)  How can `pwd` return anything but the correct capitalization of the current directory?  2)  How can you `cd ~/desktop` and go to `/Users/foo/Desktop` unless you have a symlink or something?  This question makes no sense. <comment295282> tl;dr If your software require case sensitivity then your only option would be to build inside a HFSX disk image. <comment295304> @Allan : try what I say in the question, on a case-insensitive filesystem! You will be surprised. No, you do not need symlinks or anything. It just works (TM :-)) - and shoots you in the foot along the way. <comment295305> @fd0 the software itself does not require case sensitivity. But if a person doing a command-line build makes a typo in a path, then --- boom! <comment295307> I don't think I have used a case insensitive f/s for over 15 years now.  Who uses case insensitive file systems? <comment295312> @Allan I suppose 95% of Apple users do. By default Apple ships machines with HFS+ filesystems (i.e. case insensitive). <comment295355> Thanks! That's exactly what I was looking for.
