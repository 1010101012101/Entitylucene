But I remember that the options for what to sync can be edited when...  ol li...you connect the iPhone to the computer./li liIn iTunes, click on the iPhone in the sidebar./li liThen look out for the options at the top photos, music,... Once you click on one of those options, you can decide what to sync an what not./li /ol  <answer36169> Open iTunes. When your device is plugged in, click on it in iTunes. Then, click the TV shows tab at the top. It will say "Automatically include all episodes of all shows". Click where it says "all shows" and change it to "selected shows," then deselect the shows that you don't want.  <answer36170> Open the list in videos on your iPhone, and swipe across them to bring up the delete option.  Hit delete.  They will be removed from the phone but not from your computers iTunes.
