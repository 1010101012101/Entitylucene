I can't install or remove windows 7 or later using Boot Camp Assistant? <body> I tried for a couple days to install Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro which has OSX Yosemite (10.10.2).  As you see in the capture, the third checkbox is disabled.  I have created a Windows 7 Install disk on a USB flash and downloaded the latest Windows support software from Apple, all I have to do is install it on the Mac.

On the left pane you will see a list of storage devices, your boot drive should be at the top of the list. You should see the top device broken down into partitions. Highlight the "parent" drive (top of the list) and then click on strongPartition/strong. In the main area you will see the drive partitions. Highlight the one you need to remove and click on the "-" button. This will prompt you to confirm removal of the partition. Once you've removed the partition you can then run Boot Camp Assistant and it should hopefully work ok.  <answer171700> OK,  To start off, I will ask the typical questions.  Do you have the latest firmware for you Mac? See EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Macs.  What is the Model Identifier of your Mac?  Can you edit your question and add the output from the following commands? To enter the commands, you will need to open a Terminal application window. Some of the commands will ask for your login password. This is normal. None of the commands change your Mac. They just give me more information.  precodediskutil list diskutil cs list sudo gpt -r -vvv show -l /dev/disk0 sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  It would be helpful to know your internet connection speed. Can you start your Mac using OS X Internet Recovery and report to me how long this takes? The instructions can be found at OS X: About OS X Recovery. I just what to know how long it takes to boot.  Do you do backups? If so how? For example, do you use Time Machine?   Do you have any flash drives for external disks available? If so, how are they partitioned and formatted.  Do you have other machines running Windows or OS X. If so, which versions?  <answer171795> You won't be able to install or remove Windows7/8 with Boot Camp Assistant because you have a non-standard partition layout and the file system of your Windows partition is wrong (HFS+!):  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *751.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS WINDOWS                 100.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                  Apple_HFS MAC DATA 1              325.5 GB   disk0s3    4:          Apple_CoreStorage                         324.7 GB   disk0s4    5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS MAC OS                 *324.3 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s4                                  XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  A standard pre-Boot Camp (strongCoreStorage/strong) partition layout looks like this:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *751.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         749.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS MAC OS                 *749.4 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX                                  Unencrypted  /code/pre  A standard pre-Boot Camp (strongnon-CoreStorage/strong) partition layout looks like this:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *751.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            750.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  The hybrid MBR/GUID necessary for Boot Camp Assistant to install/boot Windows doesn't allow more than 4 partitions:   ul liApple CoreStorage or Macintosh HD/li liRecovery HD/li liyour future Windows 7/8/li lia place holder in the MBR (some count the EFI-partition as the fourth one, but this doesn't seem to be true)/li /ul  A standard post-Boot Camp Assistant Win Install (strongCoreStorage/strong) partition layout looks like this:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *751.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         324.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data Windows                 425.1 GB   disk0s4                          /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS MAC OS                 *324.3 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX                                  Unencrypted  /code/pre  A standard post-Boot Camp Assistant Win Install (strongnon-CoreStorage/strong) partition layout looks like this:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *751.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            324.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data Windows                 425.1 GB   disk0s4                          /code/pre  ul liSo back up all necessary data on the volumes MAC DATA 1, MAC OS and WINDOWS to an external drive.  /li liDetach all external drives/li liReboot to Internet Recovery Mode (press kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd after the start chime) which may take between 6 minutes (50 MBit/s) and up to an hour (5 MBit/s).  /li liStart Disk Utility and erase/partition the whole internal disk (GUID-partition scheme/HFS+/1 Partition).

Install Windows as Normal, while choosing the BOOTCAMP Drive as the destination partition.  visit this site and download the Bootcamp drivers. strongBe sure to check your Mac Specifications!/strong They can be found at the bottom of the page.  Follow instructions to install the drivers - Done!  These are the same steps I had to use when the bootcamp assistant crapped on me like yours did.  <answer187962> another possibility is that your firevault is encrypting or the encryption is on. you need to turn off firevault off, then run the bootcamp.  <comment201778> Are you using an .ISO image of a genuine Win 7 disc to create the USB installer? If so you shouldn't experience any issues. The bottom checkbox will be greyed-out unless the Boot Camp installer detects a valid disc or USB installer. <comment201780> @ScunnerDarkly: I downloaded the .ISO from internet but not from the official website. Shall I have to download it there? Does this made this problem ? <comment201936> If you downloaded it from "the internet" you may need to download a few different "versions" until you find one that works. An official one from MS will work. Assuming you have a Mac without an optical drive, if you have any friends with a retail version DVD you could ask them to create an .ISO from it using something like ImgBurn (PC, free). <comment201947> Do you first get the following popup message? "**The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition.** The startup disk must be formatted as a single Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume or already partitioned by Boot Camp Assistant for installing Windows." <comment201967> @DavidAnderson: YES, this popup appears. It's written like this: *Format* **:Encrypted Logical Partition** . So what I shall do about that. I'm totally new to Mac. <comment201971> @ScunnerDarkly: This version of .ISO that I have I installed it for several PCs, and I will buy a DVD and burn like you said. <comment201978> +1, Thanks, I will do that and give you the result. <comment202021> @DavidAnderson: this is a head ache for me, I'm trying for 7 days without any result. I have two partitions **Apple** and **Data**, I want to delete the *Data* but it can't be deleted. <comment202027> How do you know which partition @Azad should remove? I would have offered something less destructive than deleting partitions. I asked about the popup, because my Boot Camp Assistant also has the "Install or remove Windows 7 or later version" check box grayed out. I currently have OS X 10.10.2 and Windows 8.1 installed on my iMac. <comment202099> @David Anderson, Disk Utility won't allow you to remove the currently booted OS X partition. Given Azad can only see two partitions, the only partition he will be able to remove is the one he is trying to remove. <comment202135> I updated my question, please review it please. <comment202184> This output I requested, did you create it before or after installing OS X? Also, I see all the UUID's as XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX. Did you do this? By the way, I do not care about the 100 reps. I would recommend any advice given by @klanomath. He is quite good. <comment202186> If you read his post, you will notice he reloaded OS X from the internet. I am not sure if the output he presented came before or after the reload. <comment202190> How can I format the partition as NTFS, this type is exist only on Windows I think?! <comment202192> I'v erased the entire disk, there only two titles remain **751.28 GB APPLE SSD SM768E Media**  and  **disk1-- Mac OS X Base System**. What to do next Please? <comment202195> @klanomath: There no HFS, only Max OS Extended(Journaled) exists. and I selected the GUID too.
