Mac won't boot up <body> I have a Mac mini "Core i5" 2.3 (Mid-2011) model. I cannot get it to boot. When I attempt to boot it will show to a white page with a progress bar. It will load about half way and shut off.   I've followed steps in this article to try and resolve the issue, however, none of them work. The steps say to hold certain keys to get the computer to boot into recovery mode, however, none of that works. No matter what keys I press, the progress bar loads half way and shuts off.   I've tried the following steps from the mentioned article:   ul liStep 1 &amp; 2 - The mac turns on and I have a clear video signal./li liStep 3 - Run Disk Utility in Recovery Mode - This doesn't work when I hold the keys down. /li liStep 4 - Safe Boot the Mac - This doesn't work when I hold the keys down. /li liStep 5 - File system consistency check  - This doesn't work when I hold the keys down. /li liStep 6 - Reset the NVRAM  - This doesn't work when I hold the keys down. /li liStep 7 - Reset the SMC - This should have been reset. The computer had been powered off for several days. /li liStep 8 - Target disk mode - I do not have a second mac to try this step. /li liStep 9 - Reinstall Mac OS X or macOS Sierra - Cannot access recovery mentioned in Step 3 so I cannot try this./li /ul  Not mentioned in the article, but I removed the ram and inserted the ram again to see if that would help solve any problems, it didn't.   Any idea what I can do to resolve the issue?  <comment334510> Probably an issue with the logic board or GPU. Run an [Apple Hardware Test](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257) to diagnose it and comment back `@owlswipe` what that reveals. <comment334516> This is a "my car is broken"-type question! You should at least add **which** steps of the many mentioned in the article (and additionally linked solutions) you followed without success. <comment334520> @klanomath - See edit. <comment334521> What do you mean "this doesn't work when I hold the keys down"?  Try booting in Verbose Mode - hold Cmd-V while turning on your Mac. <comment335551> @owlswipe - The diagnostics open but it won't run. I left it overnight and it was frozen when I checked the next day. <comment335599> @L84 Did you do anything before the issue started that might have caused this? Examples includeâ€“installing Windows or Linux on the device, getting some malware on the device, etc. If you didn't do any of those (i.e. the issue caused itself) you should bring your device into the Apple Store as it's almost definitely an issue with the hardware.
