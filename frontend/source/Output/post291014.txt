Backup from iPhone on Linux without iTunes <body> Is it possible to back up short messages from an iPhone on Linux, without iTunes?  <answer291024> Yes, you can use the libimobiledevice project to backup your iPhone.  The project website is: http://www.libimobiledevice.org  However, most Linux distributions have it available in their package managers for easy installation.  <comment367470> Thanks.  I tried using the programme idevicebackup2, but it fails.  Also, it seems an encryption password is set, even though I haven't chosen one. <comment367516> In order for anyone to be able to help you, you need to specify _how_ it fails. I.e. which command did you enter, and what kind of error messages and other output did you get? The encryption password cannot set itself automatically, you (or another person using the iPhone) must have set it. If you have set it in iTunes for example, this is the same password you must enter here with idevicebackup2. <comment367526> https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/291052/exporting-sms-messages-from-iphone-into-plain-text-files <comment367527> I may have set the encryption password in i-tunes a long time ago.    (didn't realize it was stored on the phone.)  any way to reset it without knowing it? <comment367545> No need to ask the same question twice in two different postings - just update the current one with your program output. <comment367546> Try with the password "1234" - it is the default password for some. Apart from that the only way to change the password without knowing it is to erase the iPhone and set it up as new.
