A standard way of dealing with a system crash / freeze <body> Is there a best-practice way of dealing with a system crash or a system freeze? I know of the "force-quit" keyboard shortcut. But what if it doesn't work?  I just bought a MacBookPro and I am switching from Linux. In Linux there is a possibility to shutdown the X window system, and log in from  a text console, or one can communicate with the kernel directly via magic SysRq-key, and for example, remount a hard disk read-only or reboot the system.  <answer3461> If force-quitting doesn't work you have a few options:  ul liSit it out and wait for the Mac to churn through whatever it is stuck on (this doesn't always work, but I've had beachballs go away over time)./li liTrying opening Activity Viewer and see if you can kill the process there. Same caveat as above./li liForce-shutdown the Mac by holding the power button for seven seconds. This emalways/em works./li /ul  The relationship between Mac OS X and the Unix underpinnings aren't the same as they are between X window/GNOME and the kernel. It isn't nearly as open, so there is really no messing with the kernel near as I can tell in Mac OS X. I usually go the route I mentioned above and as long as I maintain the system properly and regularly I always seem to get back on my feet without any problems.  <comment3146> I must admit, this is a bit surprising. Isn't the use of the power button dangerous? Again, on Linux it's usually the wost thing you can do, resulting eventually in a corrupted file system. Thanks! <comment3147> I've never had a problem with the file system upon killing the power to a Mac ever. I've had open files get corrupted, but I save early and often, so it's been a long, long time since that has last happened. <comment3149> Recent versions of OS X use file system journalling by default, which means the file system can almost always heal itself after a crash.  Mind you, this does nothing to protect the contents of open files... <comment3153> I bought a new MacBookPro last thursday, and I already had a system freeze three times. Two of them while copying data from an external hard disk and one after a system update.. not a very lucky start :( But you are right Gordon: with journaling a file system should be able to rewind to the last working state. <comment3226> Journalling doesn't work by rewinding, it actually does more the opposite: it completes whatever file operations were in process when the computer crashed. <comment68336> SysRq-key is mapped to F13 on Macs, see: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17986/where-is-the-f13-button-on-my-macbook-pro
