Unable to start computer after using sudo crontab -e <body> I've set it so that my Mac will forcefully shutdown at 12:00 everyday. But I try to turn it back on, it shuts down again right after.  <answer117898> What command did you put in the crontab file itself, codeshutdown -h now/code ?  Boot into single user mode (Command-S) to edit out the offending crontab entry and try the codepmset/code method.  The command codesudo pmset repeat shutdown mtwrfsu 12:00:00/code (noon) or code...00:00:00/code (midnight) will accomplish what you are looking for without using codecrontab/code.   To cancel this, execute the command codesudo pmset repeat cancel/code  <answer117900> Boot to single user mode, mount the filesystem and then delete or edit the cron tab file for the affected user (or all users if needed).  precode/sbin/mount -uw / cd /private/var/at/tabs rm whatever /code/pre  When you are done you can codeexit/code that shell to continue booting the Mac.
