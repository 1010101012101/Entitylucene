Frequent locations glitch <body> If an iPhone's frequent location service doesn't record a visited location because it was only visited once, will it show that the phone didn't go anywhere at all? For instance...if the phone was home before and after visiting the one location will it show that the phone was home for the entire time or will it show a gap in the time spent at home?
