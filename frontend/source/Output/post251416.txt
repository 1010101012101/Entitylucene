VirtualBox 5.0.26 on OS X 10.11.5: Why is video playback fast? <body> I am running Debian 8.5 in VirtualBox 5.0.26 with OS X El Capitan as host. Video playback (using codemplayer/code or codetotem/code) happens to be slightly fast. I am presently having to do something like this to make the playback feel normal:  precodemplayer -speed 0.85 &lt;video_file&gt; /code/pre  Does anyone know of a solution?
