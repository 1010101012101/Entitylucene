About This Mac -> Storage is wrong? <body> Per codeApple/code-codeAbout This Mac/code-codeStorage/code, it says codeApps/code - code276.79GB/code, yet when I do codedu -hs/code via codeTerminal/code, I'm getting something else:  precodealexus@mbp:~ $ sudo du -hcs /Applications/ /Library/ Password:  22G    /Applications/  10G    /Library/  32G    total alexus@mbp:~ $  /code/pre  same goes for codePhotos/code (code31.79GB/code), codeAudio/code (code29.68GB/code) and codeMovies/code (code11.3GB/code):  precodealexus@mbp:~ $ du -hs Pictures/ Music/ Movies/ Downloads/ 5.9G    Pictures/  29G    Music/ 496K    Movies/  80K    Downloads/ alexus@mbp:~ $  /code/pre  I'm confused, how is it counting exactly, or what is it counting)?  precodealexus@mbp:~ $ df -h Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1     465Gi  212Gi  252Gi    46% 55751222 66086376   46%   / devfs          326Ki  326Ki    0Bi   100%     1128        0  100%   /dev map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0        0  100%   /net map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0        0  100%   /home alexus@mbp:~ $ du -hcs ~ 146G    /Users/alexus 146G    total alexus@mbp:~ $  /code/pre  <answer232201> The Storage pane will show you information about files matching those categories inclusive of the entire drive, not necessarily only the files stored in those respective locations.  For example, if you downloaded a 5GB movie file, that would be +5gb in the "Videos" category, even though it might reside in ~/Downloads instead of ~/Movies  Source  That being said, your overall usage does not come anywhere close to what the storage is reporting, in terms of the entire drive having less used than you say for the Apps category alone (unless your question was not clear). To reset those values, perform a reindex of Spotlight:  Run the following command from Terminal: codesudo mdutil -E //code  OR follow instructions below:  Instructions  <comment283743> after running `sudo mdutil -E /`, it appears to be more accurate now, well, except now, I got `191.04GB` of `Other` whatever that may be... any ideas?) <comment283854> @alexus other includes anything not in those categories, and can include OS files, data contained inside of your Messages archive, etc. - sort of a catch-all bucket. The link titled "Source" above should be able to shed more light on what the actual categories mean and show :)
