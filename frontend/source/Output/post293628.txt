How to make the OS think a removable media drive is non-removable? <body> I'd like to be able to use a USB pen drive as if it's an internal drive - is this possible?  I saw some info about flipping the 'removable flag bit' of the drive using terminal command  precodedd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=1 count=1 /code/pre  however, after trying with a number of 64 GB pen drives from different manufacturer I always get the message  precodeOperation not permitted /code/pre  I tried SUDO before the command (eek) but no difference.  Any other ways to do this, or perspectives to add?
