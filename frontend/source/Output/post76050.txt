can I point my Pictures folder to a folder in an external hard drive? <body> I would like to save some space on my laptop and to do so I was thinking of moving my Pictures folder on an external hard drive. As OSX doesn't want me to mess around with the main folders in my home, how can I do this and is it safe to do so?  (this follows from my original question, which was closed as it wasn't a real question https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/76019/can-i-point-one-of-the-user-core-folders-to-an-external-hard-drive)  <answer76208> As Rabskatran pointed out, you can move your iPhoto Library if iPhoto is your primary photo manager. Or Aperture, it doesn't matter in this case.  Also, before we start, I would suggest you strongNOT/strong to move your emPictures/em folder as it might mess with the structure of the system.  Anyway, here are the steps:  ol liClose iPhoto if open,/li liGo to your emPictures/em folder,/li liMove that folder named as emiPhoto Library/em to your external disk,/li liMake sure that the transfer is strongFULLY/strong finished,/li liOpen iPhoto while holding down the emalt/em key on your keyboard,/li liFrom the pop-up Finder browser, choose your iPhoto Library on your external disk./li /ol  This way you transferred your iPhoto library to your external disk and made iPhoto to directly open up with your photo libraries new place.  <comment88245> What you can do is to move iPhoto folder if this is the App that you use to manage your pictures. It's quite easy to do. <comment88308> yeah, I'm aware of that. However I wonder whether it's not just easier to create a symlink and deal with the issue once and for all. <comment88446> thanks for your detailed explanation, but this does not answer my question (you might want to have a look at the original question I asked http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/76019/can-i-point-one-of-the-user-core-folders-to-an-external-hard-drive). Also, could you elaborate on your comment where you write "it might mess with the structure of the system". thanks. <comment88545> Other things on the system would expect the Pictures folder to be at it's present place. There might come a time that some other program would fail because you moved it. A symbolic link might work but then again, it's wise NOT to move it.
