Did I mess up my .profile file? <body> I was trying to update my system path, followed some directions online and accidentally types:  precodetouch ~/.profile /code/pre  Did I overwrite my .profile file? Does this mean that I have destroyed all of my PATH information? If so, how do I fix this?  <answer234902> I see that you are on OSX which doesn't have a code~/.profile/code file by default. So you probably didn't do any damage.   Just run codeecho $PATH/code to confirm that it has the usual directories: code/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code  <answer234904> The short answer is "no".  The codetouch/code command does not modify the data in a file at all. Its effects on a file are:  ol liIf the file does not exist it is created/li liIf the file exists if sets its access time metadata to the current time/li /ol  There are some more options but in this case they are irrelevant, you can see the whole documentation by typing codeman touch/code in the terminal.  So, no worries, your code.profile/code file was not modified.
