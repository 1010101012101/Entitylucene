Google Mail for iOS: How to disable image resizing? <body> I occasionally mail screenshots to colleagues and clients from the official  codeGoogle Mail/code app on my iPhone.  Apparently, it automatically scales them down: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S2HIL.png" alt="Ended up being only a third of the original size"  The image originally was a code1.9 MB/code screenshot from the new iPad.  I checked the app and the settings but was unable to find a way to disable this behavior.  <answer45038> At the moment you cannot configure this. As an alternative you can use the emnative/em email app which will ask you if you want to resize large images and let you choose their new size.  <answer45158> You could also use a service like Dropbox and mail them the link. A bit less convenient but you'd make sure that no resizing is happening.
