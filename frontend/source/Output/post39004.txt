How do I send a file by Bluetooth from Android smartphone to an iMac running OS X Lion? <body> I am unsuccessfully sending a file from my smartphone Huawei Ideos X5 with Android 2.3.5 to my iMac. I paired the devices successfully. Android phone receives successfully anything from iMac, but iMac cannot receive anything. I disabled my firewall and disabled the stealth mode too but still problem persists.  strongHow can you make iMac able to receive a file by Bluetooth from Android smartphone?/strong  <answer39050> You need to enable Bluetooth Sharing. Go to System Preferences  Bluetooth  Sharing Setup...  check Bluetooth Sharing.  <answer39055> Provided you have done what Vlad said (enable the Bluetooth sharing) and paired the devices (which you seem to have done), I have absolutely no problem to send files via bluetooth using my Nexus-S. I have ICS 4.03 now, but I had 2.3.x (where X is 3, 4, 5 and 6 if I'm not mistaken).   Once you have the devices Paired, if the Mac is in range and with BT enabled, the phone can send files because the Mac should be on the phone's list of paired devices. I recall that in 2.3.x sometimes it won't work, but retrying to turning on/off BT was usually enough. I don't use it a lot, but I just tried (after months of probably never touching bluetooth on either device) and I got this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sBk8a.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's my preference pane:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mJlpo.png" alt="enter image description here"  and Finally, this is my Phone's paired list (two are intentionally blurred), but you can see my Macbook Air:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7umu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Hope you can double-check your settings.

Model, OS Version, etc. <comment44187> @Mart√≠nMarconcini It is Huawei Ideos X5 with Android 2.3. - The problem is probably with Mac and its support with Android devices. <comment44188> Exact Android version 2.3.5, the official release. <comment202360> I found that turning bluetooth off and on again on both devices got file transfer to work. <comment227591> Great answer! I only needed to check that **Bluetooth Sharing** to get it working. :)
