Replace Finder with Forklift <body> Is possible to have Forklift open folders, paths, etc instead of Finder?  <answer7874> Discussion here on replacing codeFinder/code with codenautilus/code.  You can add a Quit menu item to Finder and quit it like so:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder QuitMenuItem 1; killall Finder /code/pre  Now, run ForkLift.  You could try (WARNING: DANGEROUS) to rename ForkLift2.app as Finder.app and replace Finder.app, but I think this would probably just cause problems, possibly severe ones.  What do you mean by "open folders, paths, etc."? Almost all Finder interactions on my computer are initiated by me. Just use ForkLift instead. The only time something else uses Finder is if I double-click on a DMG, then it opens in Finder. If you have this, or other specific use cases that you would like to have interact with ForkLift, please clarify or post additional specific questions.  <answer114654> Add these to your code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist/code  precode{   LSHandlerContentType = "public.folder";     LSHandlerRoleAll = "com.binarynights.forklift2"; } /code/pre  Then reboot.  BTW, this answer to Set ForkLift as default file viewer may also work.  <answer173554> You can change default file manager like this, but ForkLift or Transmit not work as expected, only Path Finder are  precode#!/usr/bin/python2.6  from LaunchServices import LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType, kLSRolesViewer, LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme from CoreFoundation import CFPreferencesCopyApplicationList, kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost, CFPreferencesSetAppValue, CFPreferencesAppSynchronize  applicationBundleIdentifier = "com.cocoatech.PathFinder" #"com.panic.Transmit" #"com.binarynights.forklift2"  LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType("public.folder", kLSRolesViewer, applicationBundleIdentifier) LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme("file:///", applicationBundleIdentifier)  applicationIDs = CFPreferencesCopyApplicationList(kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost) for app_id in applicationIDs:     CFPreferencesSetAppValue("NSFileViewer", applicationBundleIdentifier, app_id);     CFPreferencesAppSynchronize(app_id); /code/pre  <comment10249> quitting the Finder will also disable the desktop :-(
