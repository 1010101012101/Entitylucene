"lsof -i" Command output explanation <body> i am attempting to maintain a closer eye on my Apple-Mac's outgoing and incoming connections; in collaboration with other processes such as codetcpdump/code and codenetstat/code, i have been using the command: codelsof -i/code, which allegedly displays all processes using the internet.  The output of this command is fairly simple, however does return some confusing results, including multiple instances of the process codecom.apple/code which has little to no explanation online. Whilst listing Spotify and its various related processes such as codeSpotifyWE/code, the command declines to list other applications which i happen to know are using the network, such as Safari and Mail.  To simplify things, my questions are:  ul liWhat is the purpose of the process codecom.apple/code?/li liWhy are there multiple listings of the same process?/li liWhy are some processes/applications which are definitely using the internet omitted from the command (codelsof -i/code)`s result./li /ul  <answer210815> lsof's output is truncated. Paste the following command into Terminal:  precodeps -Ac|grep com.apple /code/pre  This'll show you all the processes it could be referring to. You'll have to look at their PID to know which is which (second column in lsof, first column in ps).   A process will only be listed if it is has an active connection to somewhere. Not all applications maintain an active connection at all times.  <comment254465> ahh ok, so they are not multiple instances of the same process, instead multiple separate processes, we just can't see the full process name. And i have verified your theory about the command only listing active connections at that time by launching Mail, the theory seems to be correct <comment254466> Hypothetically, if i had a key logger which was transmitting my keystrokes off-site, the process would be listed in this commands output wouldn't it? Assuming it wasn't somehow masked. <comment254467> It would be, yes. There are ways to piggyback on other connections for the more elite hackers though, but it isn't common. :) <comment254468> Yeah that does make sense, interesting, thanks for your help. <comment254469> My pleasure! :)
