Rather, software security is a relative term: Some software is more secure, other software less so.  As for java, when run as a plugin in the browser, I think it is safe to say that its security record has been rather abysmal. There have been many security holes, and though all publicly known security holes have been patched as far as I know, history does not inspire confidence.  Since you use firefox, you can improve your security somewhat by enabling codeplugins.click_to_play/code. If you do, all plugins such as flash and java will be disabled on every web page you visit until you click on the plugin to allow it to run.  To enable this feature, type codeabout:config/code in the Firefox address bar and hit return. You may get a warning. Take it seriously! Messing around in codeabout:config/code without knowing what you're doing can really ruin your setup. Anyhow, find the option codeplugins.click_to_play/code in the list – there is a handy search box that you can use – and double click the line to toogle the value between false and true.

I read that some malicious site can do some stuff if your browser has java plug-in installed. <comment115696> @TLE which is the defintion of insecure surely. The reason I ask for the exact quote is that the issue is time dependent - <comment115698> http://lifehacker.com/5988800/what-is-java-is-it-insecure-and-should-i-use-it <comment115699> What @Mark is saying the last discovered security hole was plugged. <comment115703> Let's temporarily close this as a duplicate and see if there is really a second distinct question here. We can merge the answers if this really is a continued discussion on Java security
