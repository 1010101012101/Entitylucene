iCloud missing in settings iOS 10.3 <body> After installing iOS 10.3 last night, iCloud is missing in my settings.   Can anyone help or advise ?  <answer270582> Starting with iOS 10.3, the strongSettings/strong app features a section dedicated to your personal profile at the very top. Youâ€™ll find the old strongiCloud/strong submenu in there.

Posting screenshots of your Settings screens will help us troubleshoot
