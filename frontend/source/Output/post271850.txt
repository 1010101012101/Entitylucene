Excluding those provided by Automator, is it possible to custom define what a Service can receive as an input? <body> If one opens Automator.app and creates a new Service document, one is presented with the ability to choose exactly what kind of input that that Service receives:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XXCV.png" alt="Automator screen shot"  Outside of using these default data types, can the user further define the input of a Service, so that the Service can only run if the input meets some condition(s)?  An example would be if I only wanted a Service to appear in the right-click context menu when the selected text begins with "Review."
