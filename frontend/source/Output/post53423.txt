What does it take to get FaceBook to stop pushing notifications to my iPhone? <body> I don't want FaceBook to put any notifications on my iPhone's home screen for anything, ever.  I've gone into the iPhone's "settings" app and turned off strongall/strong  notifications for FaceBook.  I've gone into the settings within the FB app itself and turned off all push notifications.  But I strongstill/strong get notifications.  What more do they want from me?  <answer53424>    Settings - Notifications   You have to choose strongnone/strong in the notification style menu, and strongdisable all buttons/strong.   <answer53426> If there is something FaceBook is good at, it's in bothering it's users :)br So make sure you've unchecked those items:  Make sure you've switched the strongNotification Center/strong-slider to off and the strongAlert Style/strong to none in such a way FaceBook is listed in the strongNot In Notification Center/strong.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Hc0i.png" width="300"/ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LHUyw.png" width="300"/  And if you go to strongSettings &lt; FaceBook/strong, make sure you're strongPush Notifications/strong are all switched off.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAxpF.png" width="300"/ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/na5Tw.png" width="300"/  <answer82303> Go onto the persons page that u want to block you notifications from then click "friends"/"add frien" and press notifications and when u press it,it will get rid of a tick on the right hand side! If in stead a tick appears. press it again to stop the notifications! hope this answer helped! thanks! :)  <comment61114> Thank you very much for the detailed answer. <comment61115> Did it turn off your push notifications? <comment61219> So far, yes. It appears to have done so. <comment94984> But OP wants iOS notifications turned off not FB notifications. And please use grammatical English in the answer so that it may be understood.
