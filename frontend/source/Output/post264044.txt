Chrome is not saving my bookmark preferences <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKTWa.png" alt="enter image description here"  So recently I organized my bookmarks on my Bookmarks Bar on Chrome but for some reason it's not storing my preferences after I rebooted. I've already organized it for three times and they all restored back to it's original settings after I rebooted.   I'm on Yosemite (emver. 10.10.5/em) and my Google Chrome version is Version 55.0.2883.75 (64-bit)
