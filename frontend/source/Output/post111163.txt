FaceTime Calls from Contacts Only? <body> Is there a way to only allow facetime calls from people in your address book?    <answer111178> h2Not really./h2  On OS X, I wasn't able to find any possibility of doing this. I'm eager to be proven wrong on that point, of course.  hr  On iOS, you can kinda do it - by abusing Do Not Disturb. Following these steps will, of course, make it so that your device won't show you notifications. At all.  Really want to do this? Ok, let's get started:  ol liFind your Do Not Disturb preferences.   ul listrongiOS 5/6/strong: Settings  Notifications  Do Not Disturb/li listrongiOS 7/strong: Settings  Do Not Disturb/li /ul/li liManually turn on Do Not Disturb  ul listrongiOS 5/6/strong: Root settings window, it's a switch./li listrongiOS 7/strong: In the Do Not Disturb window, there's a 'Manual' switch. Activate it./li /ul/li liTurn off Scheduling:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zIxjX.png" alt="enter image description here" 4. Select 'Allow calls from', and set it to 'All Contacts':  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CIgzK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Optionally, disable the two-calls-in-three-minutes feature. I wouldn't though - it's kinda important for emergencies.  Now, your iOS device won't accept FaceTime calls from anyone not in your contacts - at the price of not being able to receive notifications, either.  <comment130868> Good question. One thing to keep in mind is that you can also block specific callers. If someone is on you a lot (against your wish), you can go to Recents, select the (i) on the right, then scroll to the bottom to "Block this Caller". I am of the opinion that someone will lose steam rather quickly if they have to sign up for a new email address or phone number every time they want to bother you.
