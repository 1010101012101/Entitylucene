X11 app no longer opening since 10.10.3 <body> After upgrading to 10.10.3 X11 applications are not opening anymore from the terminal.  The codeX11/code symlink in code/usr/code is correct  precode$ ls -l /usr/X11 lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  8 Aug  7  2014 /usr/X11 -&gt; /opt/X11 /code/pre  I reinstalled XQuartz (2.7.7)  code$DISPLAY/code is set  precode$ echo $DISPLAY  /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.mXmpHGFD7q/org.macports:0 /code/pre  Opening applications from the X11 menu (e.g. Applications - Terminal) works.  Opening them from the Terminal app does nothing. Applications (e.g. xterm, emacs, ...) are stuck  What could I try?  strongUpdate/strong  If I disconnect an external display then even the application opened via X11 menu are not working anymore. I have to close X11 and reopen it.  <answer182194> Seems to be a problem with pixman compatibility...  precode$/usr/X11/bin/X  dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libpixman-1.0.dylib   Referenced from: /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin   Reason: Incompatible library version: X11.bin requires version 33.0.0 or later, but libpixman-1.0.dylib provides version 25.0.0 /code/pre  <answer184852> Try installing the XQuartz package on MacOS Forge. I personally have had problems with Macports XQuartz and Yosemite, however the standard installer works perfectly for me. Or maybe try using the xorg-server package from Macports.  <answer200443> I've been having problems since OSX 10, now using XQuartz 2.7.7 (xorg-server 1.15.2) and when the X11 Terminal windows opens (the app freezes at this point) I simply close it by typing 'exit' at the prompt. After that, it all works fine for me.   Don't try and install the automatic update version - simply download it stand-alone.  <answer260338> for MAC  on v 2.7.11 https://www.xquartz.org/releases/XQuartz-2.7.10_rc5.html  precodesudo mv /opt/X11/lib/libXt.6.dylib{,.bak} sudo cp /opt/X11/lib{/flat_namespace,}/libXt.6.dylib /code/pre  <comment216780> I don't get the error. Opening `/usr/X11/bin/X` just starts X11 (as expected). But then no application can be opened. <comment216814> Try adding the app XQuartz. Worked for me. <comment216816> As stated "I reinstalled XQuartz (2.7.7)", I already have the latest XQuartz version <comment219249> Yes, this is what I had before and what I re-installed. <comment219251> @Matteo Try running the installer or Macports install in verbose and look out for any errors <comment219258> Hi, your answer gave me the idea to try the opposite. Instead of using the MacOS Forge package I installed xorg-server from MacPorts and it now works like a charm. I'll award the bounty, but then update your answer so that I can mark it as accepted. Many thanks! Ok, I have to wait 13h hours for the bounty ... <comment219261> @Matteo Updated the answer <comment219266> Thanks, I'll assign the bounty as soon as it is allowed. <comment219362> Wrong Answer for the bounty, whatever I'll grant another 100 to sebastien ... <comment219363> I opened another bounty.
