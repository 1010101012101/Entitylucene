Why the am/pm is not showing on OS X Mavericks? <body> I have a strange issue after upgrading to Mavericks from Mountain Lion. The am/pm does not show on the menu bar always. Sometime it shows and sometime not. What could be the reason ? I am running 10.9.1 now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k9V8l.png" alt="Menu bar"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0I8yx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment139305> I see it correctly (I don't normally use it but activating it reveals no issues, apparently). Have you tried rebooting? If you have just upgraded, it might help. <comment139306> Go to **Date & Time** in **System Preferences** and see whether AM/PM is on. Attach the screenshot that panel in the question too. <comment139312> @sayzlim - If you read my question carefully, I have written that, it shows sometime and sometime not. It has been an issue since I have upgraded in Oct/Nov '13. <comment139331> It looks like you're not the only one:  https://discussions.apple.com/message/23632584#23632584  If it's a deep Mavericks bug, you might need to wait for a fix from Apple.
