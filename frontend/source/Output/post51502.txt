Force carrier update on the new Ipad <body> My carrier (Telekom.de) updated their carrier settings (from 12.0 to 12.1) recently. Normally I should be able to update by going to      Tap Settings  General  About. If an update is available, a prompt will appear.   However this prompt does not appear. I know of other people that have seen this update immediately after release. Is there any other way to force this update?
