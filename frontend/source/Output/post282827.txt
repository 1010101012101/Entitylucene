Is it possible to modify timestamps of an unsent message in Mail.app outbox <body> I am trying to determine if a student in my course is being deceptive by handing in work late.  The student has Mail.app configured with multiple outgoing SMTP servers:gmail and two *.edu servers.  The second edu server was configured as the default, but "wasn't sending mail properly".  As a result, project submissions the student "believed" they had submitted correctly were never delivered.   I have a zip archive of the work, whose timestamps inside the archive are reasonable.  However, this is forgable easily.   strongCan the timestamps of an email in Mail.app outbox be easily forged?/strong  <comment356523> i should clarify: an email in the outbox _which was never actually sent_.
