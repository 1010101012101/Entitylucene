Mail client compose window no londer sliding up <body> I dont know how I switched this off, but when opening message or composer, it no longer slides up from the bottom of the email client. I cannot see where to reset this.   <comment298022> Can you give some more information, like are you still in full screen mode?  What does the composer window do now, if anything? <comment298387> It slides up in fullscreen mode. I thought it happened, minimized also. So I may have been incorrect. Thank you!
