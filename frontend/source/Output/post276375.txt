Turn off Touch bar Preview on display <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwjIp.jpg" alt="enter image description here" I do not see this on other Macbooks. Not sure how I got it, but I cannot find any settings in the Preferences.   Basically, every time I touch the touch bar, I get a preview of the touchbar as a strip on the the bottom of the screen display. Long Press is delayed as a result of this as there is a circle progress that shows to help users in long pressing.  How can I disable this? It is intrusive and not useful at all.  <answer276384> Go to System Preferences - Accessibility - Zoom. Uncheck Show Touch bar zoom (not sure what exactly it says, not on my computer right now).   As of 10.12.3, there is a bug. If that checkbox didn't appear, restart your computer will make it appear.  <comment347830> It's wierd that when I search touch bar in System Preferences, it doesn't point anything to Accessibility. <comment347831> @NeilDA yeah, I know. It's kind of hidden
