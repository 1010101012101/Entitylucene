iCal share multiple calendars with one person <body> I'd like to share all my calendars with my boss. She shares her calendars with me using Google Calendar and I was hoping doing the same with my calendars. How can I share multiple calendars to be visible as one? I can only find calendars to be shared one-by-one.  <comment146734> I've updated your question to be more specific and improved readability to improve the chances of getting the right answer. <comment146781> Apple's ical only allows one-by-one sharing. I don't know of an app that does what you want
