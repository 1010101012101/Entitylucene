Do iOS devices have a pop-up Japanese-English Dictionary like on the Macintosh? <body> On the Mac if you three-finger tap a word, a dictionary definition appears. I'd like to know if I would be able to get this on an iPad specifically for the Japanese dictionaries.  <answer77466> Yes, on iPad on iOS5.1.1. At the moment, I am having trouble getting the same functionality on iPhone on iOS6.0.1, though. Japanese dictionary is there, but I can't get the English-Japanese one. Your mileage may vary, of course.  hr  strongEDIT/strong May 27 2013: To restore Japanese&lt;-English dictionary, you will need to jailbreak the device and delete the Japanese&lt;-Japanese dictionary. These dictionaries conflict, and the Japanese&lt;-Japanese dictionary wins almost every time.  I have also asked if it is possible to emonly temporarily/em jailbreak an iOS 6.1.2 iPhone 4 for purposes of removing the mentioned dictionary. As of the time of this edit, this has not been answered; I am nonetheless linking to that question in case someone answers it by the time someone reads this.  <comment89774> As far as I can determine, the translation dictionary for Japanese was dropped in iOS 6, or is no longer accessible. There have been various complaints in the ASC. <comment89943> @TomGewecke Someone posted on ASC that Apple Support told them it's a bug. Hopefully that's it -- it's just a bug. <comment89967> Yes, hopefully that means they will fix it.  But Apple Support is often clueless when it comes of language issues... <comment124082> The translation dictionary has been restored in iOS 7, but many users complain that it has to be repeatedly downloaded and will not stay permanently active on the device.
