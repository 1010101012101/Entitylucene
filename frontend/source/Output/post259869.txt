See What Redo/Undo Will Do on Mac <body> Hitting kbd⌘/kbd + kbdZ/kbd strongUndoes/strong the last action, and kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⇧/kbd + kbdZ/kbd strongRe/strongdoes it.br In order to see emwhat exactly/em you are about to Undo/Redo, you can click on "Edit" on the top of the screen.    strongQuestion:/strongbr What is the keyboard shortcut to find out emwhat exactly/em you are about to Undo/Redo?  <answer259873> I don't think there is a shortcut to see what Undo would do; if there is one I don't know about it.  The workaround I'd suggest would be kbdfn/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdf2/kbd (focuses the menu bar), then kbde/kbd (selects the Edit menu) and then kbd&darr;/kbd (opens the menu).  <comment325197> Neat. Any way to jump to the "E" part of that? Or a setting to do less steps? <comment325200> I don't think so. ctrl+f2 is defined as "Move focus to the menu bar", there seem to be no shortcut to jump to specific menus.
