How to use keynote magic move with Connection Lines? <body> When I use magic move with connetion lines, they disappear and reappear in the next slide.  It seems like magic move doesn't recognize the connection lines (or can't match them), so it just redraws them, instead of leaving them there.  I'm trying to use magic move to make a nice presentation that includes connection lines. How can I make without the lines disappearing every time something moves?  <answer194288> Turns out, according to several sources you can't do it. You would need to separate the lines (i.e. not use connection lines).
