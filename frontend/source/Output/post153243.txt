Changing trackpad scroll direction with AppleScript in Yosemite <body> I prefer "natural" scroll direction when using my MBAir trackpad, but "unnatural" when using the mouse. I frequently switch back and forth depending on where I'm working, so I've been using a bit of AppleScript to switch the setting. This script stopped working when I upgraded to Mac OS Yosemite. It still opens the Scroll &amp; Zoom pane of the Trackpad preferences, but it doesn't click the checkbox. I've tried a few things but I can't get it to work.. I'm not an Apple Developer, so I don't have any debugging tools. Any tips?   precodetry     tell application "System Preferences"         activate         set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.trackpad"     end tell      tell application "System Events"         tell process "System Preferences"             click radio button "Scroll &amp; Zoom" of tab group 1 of window "Trackpad"             click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window "Trackpad"         end tell     end tell end try /code/pre  <answer153288> I answered my own question: If this script isn't working, go to System Preferences | Security &amp; Privacy | Accessibility, and make sure that Script Editor is checked ON to allow Applescripts to control the GUI.  <answer232961> So what was happening was it was cycling thought the code to fast. So what i did was put delays in between where it wasn't working and it works perfectly fine. If you want to you could reduce the delay down to 0.5 or 0.2  tell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.trackpad" end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         delay (1)         click radio button "Scroll &amp; Zoom" of tab group 1 of window "Trackpad"         delay (1)         click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window "Trackpad"         delay (1)     end tell end tell
