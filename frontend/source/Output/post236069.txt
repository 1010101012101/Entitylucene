Builduser() Error building user of type <body> I have entered Single user mode like 5min ago. Meanwhile I shut down the computer, tried to get back to Single user mode my pressing codecmd+S/code and it doesnt work. It outputs the error saying codeBuilduser() Error building user of type 0xffsomethinggoeshere/code  It worked 5min ago. All I did was to run some ls commands. What could be the problem?  Edit Verbose mode doesnt work either.  <comment288781> Have you restored /var or reinstalled the OS - or still got malware - from your previous answers your machine is in a non working state so until you do one or more of the above you are lucky to get it to do anything <comment288782> Nope, just ls-ing the folders and seeing what was there. It turns out that that .Trashes is not the folder I should inspect. It is /Users/YOUR-USER-NAME/.Trash. This is where I will find /var <comment288786> Basically I'm with @mark here. Your system is in an unknown state after removal of /var, so all bets are off regarding any error/warning messages you are getting. <comment288787> I agree with you two. What bothers me is that it worked 5min ago, but now it wont. <comment288788> You were lucky 5 mins ago - it is not a useful thing to bother about <comment288789> So how to make a dics copy? I cant login, and I cant run from single user mode. <comment288790> Boot into recovery mode and take it from there
