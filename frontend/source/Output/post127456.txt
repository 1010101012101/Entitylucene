Hard Drive Formatting Error in Terminal <body> I have tried formatting and partitioning this brand new hard drive and it has failed on multiple computers using multiple methods. It is a LaCie Porsche Design 4TB hard drive.  Here is the commands I have been running:  precode$ diskutil list disk4 /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk4    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk4s1  $ sudo gpt -r show disk4       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2          4         Pri GPT table           6      76800      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       76806  976677835   976754641          4         Sec GPT table   976754645          1         Sec GPT header $ sudo fdisk /dev/disk4 Disk: /dev/disk4    geometry: 60800/255/63 [976754646 sectors] Sector size: 4096 bytes Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  976754645] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused  3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused  4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused $ diskutil unmountDisk disk4 Unmount of all volumes on disk4 was successful sudo gpt add -b 76806 -s 976415691 -t hfs disk4 disk4s2 added $ diskutil list disk4 /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk4    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk4s1    2:                  Apple_HFS                         4.0 TB     disk4s2 $ diskutil list /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk4    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk4s1    2:                  Apple_HFS                         4.0 TB     disk4s2 /code/pre  Then here is where it appears I have ran into trouble:  precode$ sudo newfs_hfs -v "4TB" -J /dev/rdisk4s2 newfs_hfs: WriteBuffer:  pwrite(3, 0x10dfba000, 131072, 450764800): Resource busy newfs_hfs: write (sector 110050): Invalid argument /code/pre  Any ideas of what I might be doing wrong or what I can do to fix it?  Many thanks!  <answer127491> Try to verify the HDD from disk utility and repair permission if this is doesn't work, try to format it using windows machine.   <answer189907> Sent in the HD. It was broken, but they replaced it, so these are evidently sometimes the sign of a broken HD.  <comment149341> this is impressive, what does teh disk utility say <comment149351> "Disk Erase failed with the error:  File system formatter failed." <comment149413> Tried all the above. Going to call the company and get a replacement. Thanks.
