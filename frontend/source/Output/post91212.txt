Can't delete iCloud account from Mail, Contacts, Calendars <body> When trying to log into iCloud from System Preferences, I'm told     [appleid] is already signed in to iCloud      To use this as your primary iCloud account, delete it from Mail, Contacts,    and Calendars and sign in again.   However, I can't delete the account from Mail, Contacts and Calendars.  When I go to that preference pane, I'm prompted for my iCloud password, after which I'm told the account isn't verified.  Checking at http://appleid.apple.com shows that the account emis/em verified. Requesting that another verification email be sent is met with the following error:     Couldn't request a new verification email because of a server error.   Any ideas how to delete the account from Mail, Contacts and Calendars? I've deleted all other mail accounts. Removed the mail folders and plist files from code~/Library//code. Rebooted.  Tried adding a different apple id.  Tried everything I could find from Google that looked even close.  No luck.  Help!  <answer143756> I had the same problem. Fixed it by turning off all sharing (the checkbox options on the right of the panel), THEN trying to delete again.   <comment107185> Quite a bit overboard, but reloading your computer would likely nail the computer part of the problem - if all else fails. More realistically, I would call Apple, and see if they can work through the Apple ID problem with you - especially since you can't get a confirmation email sent. It sounds more like an Apple ID problem then just your computer giving you trouble. <comment107564> What happens when you go to the System Preferences pane of iCloud and click Sign Out? <comment107577> I can't sign out -- the button isn't available -- because I'm not signed in.  When I try to sign in, I get the "...is already signed in..." message in the question.
