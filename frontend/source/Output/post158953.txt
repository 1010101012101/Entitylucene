How to change selection color in appearance? <body> I usually use the "graphit" appearance in Yosemite. With "blue" I don't like the selection color. However I miss the red-yellow-green colors on the left from the "blue" appearance.  Is there some (cli) tool where you can customize the appearance and mix both themes up as you desire?  Bodo  <answer159003> selection color as in the highlight text color or the selection box color?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zJNbw.png" alt="enter image description here"  If it's the appearance, you cannot help it, unless you're willing to pay some money to change it; (emFlavours $19.90/em) Flavours looks really good and you can get the trial for free to give it a go.  If it is the Highlight color you are talking about, emcompletely/em customizeable in colors!  <comment186920> Yes I was looking for that. Hmm doesn't flavors in the end just rewrite some `.xml.plist`? <comment187078> I'm not sure... But upon further looking into alternatives to Flavours I found UNO, but it was discontinued, however it still works with Mac OSX 10.4, if it might help.
