How to recover User ID snapshot file? <body> I have accidentally changed my user ID picture on my Macbook Pro (running OS X 10.7.5). The original user ID snapshot is very dear to me and I can't find the original file saved anywhere. Is there a way to reset/recover the original User ID snapshot? I have tried to find it under Library/ User Pictures/ but only the pre-installed icons seem to be showing here. Any help would be much appreciated.  <answer188063> Execute this command in Terminal and see what happens:  precodedscl . -read /Users/[user_shortname] JPEGPhoto | tail -1 | xxd -r -p &gt; ~/Desktop/any_file_name.jpg /code/pre  Ex:  dscl . -read /Users/U92 JPEGPhoto | tail -1 | xxd -r -p  ~/Desktop/U92.jpg  Gleaned and distilled from this AskDifferent page.  <comment223006> / To be honest, I don't know the next thing about using Terminal, but after reading up on it a little, I figured I should pop into an iCentre to ask a technician's advice on how to use it before I exidently ended up causing more damage. I left more confused...:) Anyway, I decided to download a data recovery software and started scanning through the files. It was a painstakingly tedious (and a very rudimentary) way to go about it, but I have finally found the lost file!
