How to add a script that types in the password for my vps through applescript <body> I made a script recently and have turned it into an app, it basicly logs me into my vps via ssh but I don't know how to tell it how to type in my password for me, heres the code  precode tell application "Terminal"     activate     do script "ssh root@example.com" end tell /code/pre  <answer108540> What you want is pretty bad. You should never have a password written in a file.  But here is the solution you asked.   precodetell application "Terminal"     activate     do script "ssh root@example.com"     delay 1     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "yourPasswordHere"         keystroke return     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment91940> Use passwordless authentication: http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/152 <comment91945> it didn't work, I probably messed up <comment91949> @surferconor425 It's not that hard to fix, might be a better route to take. I also got it wrong the first few times but it is actually quite easy to get up and running.
