Can I use the Sites folder for whatever I want? <body> Not realizing that OS X creates a code~/Sites/code folder when you enable web sharing, I started putting my sites for MAMP within a code~/Sites/code directory, which did not exist on my new laptop. Is this ok, as long as I don't enable web sharing? Even if I did enable it, would something happen to the other files I put in there?  <answer24842> It's fine, just realize the built in apache server will share the files you have placed there unless you change the apple supplied httpd.conf should you start up web sharing.   <answer24859> Any files you put in the code~/Sites/code folder will be treated the same way most web hosts treat the files. HTML, images &amp; scripts (scripts may need special changes to htaccess &amp; httpd.conf) will be served normally from http://my-Mac-name-here.local/~jjeaton/ .  So, like a typical webserver, whatever files you put in there strongwill not/strong be changed unless you youself edit/move/delete them.  You should also double check the permissions so that only you have read/write/execute permission and group &amp; others only have read/execute.  <comment27931> Thanks just wanted to make sure it wouldn't take over and delete any of my files.
