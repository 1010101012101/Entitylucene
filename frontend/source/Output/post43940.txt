When I open Terminal, I get an "I have no name!" prompt <body> Suddenly, this morning, I open a Terminal window and I get this:  precodeI have no name!@macbook:~$ whoami 502 /code/pre  ** I am not a number!  I am a human being! **  What gives?  Anyone know what I need to do to get my name back?    I suppose there are two problems here, one is that my hostname is undefined, the other is that whoami reports my name as a number.    <answer45956> Something in memory got corrupted, and the mapping between your userID (502) and your username (ipd) was lost.  I've seen it happen (usually when I've manually killed hung system processes), although I'm not sure exactly what causes it.  codelaunchd/code maybe?  Because that mapping is lost, codewhoami/code can't convert your ID into a username so returns the ID, and your prompt defaults to the "I have no name!" message because you effectively emdon't/em have a name.  Logging out and back in might fixit, but restarting is the best way (as you discovered).  Basically, it's a symptom of another problem, and not a problem in and of itself.  <answer48470> This happens to me randomly when I resume from standby (i.e. opening my laptop). A log out or reboot is the only way for me to fix it. I don’t know exactly what causes it. As I type it is happening right now. As the comment in the original post asked, I ran codeid -p/code and it crashed. (Crash report: http://pastebin.com/nmFFQELq)  Console commands:  codewhoami/code — returns 501  codeid -p/code — crashes  codecat /etc/passwd/code — my user is not in the document.  Any ssh attempt fails with the error:     You don't exist, go away!   I also checked out the console, from waking up, a bunch of random "Socket not connected" errors appear (which I think might be normal, being that wireless doesn’t connect immediately) from programs like Dropbox. An interesting error appears though:     4/12/12 8:37:09.045 PM coreservicesd: _scserver_ServerCheckin: client uid validation failure; getpwuid(501) == NULL      4/12/12 8:37:09.400 PM coreservicesd: _scserver_ServerCheckin: client uid validation failure; getpwuid(501) == NULL   Still not sure what is causing it, but thought I would share these diagnostics.  I’m on a Mid 2009 MacBook Pro with 10.7.3 installed.  <answer51074> I see it's an old thread, but here is the solution to this problem (without restarting the whole computer).  The problem is in the codeopendirectoryd/code daemon and the earliest reports date from the beginning of 2011. Restarting the daemon (switching users with an admin one via Fast User Switching) fixes the problem.  While writing this answer, I've found a similar question in the Serverfault here, which also covers my answer.  <answer69309> Go to the home folder in Terminal and run code. ~/.bashrc/code.  It works!!  <answer90832> I solved the problem by using iterm=preferences=URL_handler and connecting whoami to my username .. after restart on iterm, problem was no more  <answer91725> See if the permissions of the file code/etc/passwd/code are set up like this:  precode-rwxr--r-- /code/pre  because it reads the user name from the codepasswd/code file.  <answer122478> I had this same baffling problem today (Lion 10.7.5) and codedscacheutil -flushcache/code fixed it for me, as suggested in a comment in some blog.  <answer191664> My problem is the permission in passwd archive, The old permission is  -rw------- 1 root root    1280 Jun  9 15:41 passwd I used the command "chmod a+r /etc/passwd" and now all users can read this archive. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1280 Jun  9 15:41 passwd Logout the user and try. =)  <comment49950> BTW -- for those interested, i logged out (command-shift-Q) and after logging back in and restarting terminal, the problem is gone!  Still interested in what may have caused this, if for no other reason than to advance the state of my McKnowledge. <comment50026> Are you asking why the computer host name is displayed in the prompt or are you asking why the computer is named “I have no name!”? <comment50575> I am asking why, suddenly, my bash prompt displays "I have no name!" rather than a hostname.  Perhaps its just a coincidence that `whoami` is also reporting my number rather than my name. <comment50582> What do `hostname` and `id -p` return? <comment50845> my system has returned to normal.  Good suggestion though, if it happens again i'll check them both! <comment51446> This happened to me twice in the last couple weeks. Last night I ran Verify Disk from Disk Utility and it found errors. I have done the Repair Disk from its instructions. You may want to try that too. It may be our disks are going bad. <comment52617> Best theory i've heard yet, thanks! <comment52776> I wish I could explain just how that mapping gets lost, but I've never dug deep enough to figure it out. <comment58390> Happens to me after wakeup - 10.7.3 and 10.7.4. Almost 13" MBP 2010, 8G ram and Intel SSD. Only restart fixes this problem. Seems like a software problem. <comment76359> This just happened to me again.  I had killed `launchd`, and I was now `501`, which prevented me from using `sudo`.  I still don't know whether `launchd` will restart itself, or what else not having it running will affect. <comment80549> I don't think re-sourcing .bashrc solves the problem here... <comment103311> Same happened to my Macbook air 2008, 8Gb, OSX 10.7.5. I did not crash programs forcefully: only sometimes Libreoffice which got to no respond state. Restart helps. <comment265940> For what its worth, I just ran into this on a Linux machine, so I would guess the root cause is something in bash. `strings /bin/bash | grep "I have"` <comment311967> I saw this error while trying to push a branch to Github. Took me a while to figure out the root cause - I only got it when I tried to check whether my public key matched what was stored on GH. <comment329285> It was 644, not 744. Setting to 744 did not help.
