How to bring to front or order layers in Preview? <body> I do a lot of selecting, copying, pasting, and moving around on a single image in Preview for Mac. But I'm having trouble ordering the layers of an image so that the layer I want visible is on top.  Is there any way to define layer order in Preview?  <answer198838> I was able to copy to the front by holding down "option" and dragging the image. Hope this helps.  <answer252881> If understand you right, here is how I change the order of layers in Preview app.  ol liSelect an object like an arrow or rectangle for example./li liRight click on selected object./li liSelect an action from: "Bring Forward", "Bring to Front", "Send Backward", "Send to Back"./li /ol  <comment212177> As far as I know you have to use something else to work with layers, like Gimp. <comment247944> Holding down "option" and then clicking to drag works fine on Yosemite.
