When we toggle between enable and disable safari extensions, where will the state go and sit on different mac os? <body> After some research got to know that security find-generic-password -l "Safari Extensions List" -g command gives the extensions and their states. The output of the command is not in readable format. I tried saving the password as a plist and opening it, but then it is same. Can someone please guide me how to get the safari extension enable/disable state on different mac versions?  <answer155017> Ok so i looked at this and it's a total hack.  Run command with the extension installed, you will see it's name within the field.  Delete the extension from ~/Library/Extensions/Extension_you_Want  Open Safari  Close Safari  Run command again  the item is missing from the password list
