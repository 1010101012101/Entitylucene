byobu using invalid 'readlink -f' option on OS X Mountain Lion <body> I just installed byobu on mountain lion by running  precode./configure   make   make install /code/pre  The install seems good. But byobu is trying to use 'readlink -f' which is an illegal option with OS X and any other BSD system (I think).  Is there any kind of hack I can do to get around this?  <answer71257> If you lack codereadlink -f/code functionality, the coreutils and tmux are likely the missing dependencies. Please edit your question if you have them installed and this doesn't fix the issue.  <comment75718> [How can I get the behavior of GNU's readlink -f on a Mac? - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1055671/how-can-i-get-the-behavior-of-gnus-readlink-f-on-a-mac) <comment89528> i have both tmux and coreutils and i still get the same issue ... it should be using greadlink not readlink on osx
