How do I fix an app that's stuck in application switcher? <body> I'm running OS X 10.7.5 "Lion". Three times now, Preview.app has gotten in a state where its icon is visible in the application switcher (kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdTab/kbd) but it isn't running (doesn't show up in codeps ax/code in the Terminal) and will not start (e.g. double-clicking a PDF document).  I've tried codekillall Dock/code, codekillall SystemUIServer/code, and codekillall Finder/code and those do restart but the stuck Preview icon is still in the application switcher. I've also tried removing the saved state under Library  Containers  com.apple.Preview but that doesn't work either. The only thing that solves it is logging out and back in again.  Is there some way to get this unstuck without having to log out?  <answer135954> In codeTerminal.app/code, find the process ID for Dock with the codeps aux | grep Dock/code command and kill it with the codekill -9 PID/code command. An example:  precode$ ps aux | grep Dock username              290   0.0  0.4  2730344  34500   ??

Works on Mac OS 10.9.4. Don't forget to use sudo, this way `sudo ps aux | grep Dock`, look for Dock app PID and use `sudo kill -9 PID`
