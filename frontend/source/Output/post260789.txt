OSX Sierra: Mail app ignores marking of Junk/Not Junk: keeps going back to Junk folder <body> Several times I've checked my Junk folder for an IMAP account and found valid emails mislabeled as "junk".  No problem, I thought, I just:  ul liGo to the Junk folder/li liSelect the non-junk mail items and click the "Send to Inbox" icon (used to be a "Thumbs Up" icon in pre-Sierra./li liAs soon as I send it to Inbox, it disappears from my Junk folder, only to return back to the Junk folder in a fraction of a second./li liThis repeats over and over again/li /ul  After maybe 5-10 attempts for each email, they stay put, but this is strongvery/strong annoying.  Any suggestions?
