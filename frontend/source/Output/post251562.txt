Adobe CS5 dialog box always hidden by default <body> When I try to use any functions in Adobe CS5 that have a dialog box such as emImage adjustments/em--emLevels/em etc, the dialog box with the sliders does not appear on my screen, and stays hidden. The dialog is successfully triggered though, as I can see that the other menus items are greyed out as a result of this dialog box being activated.   The only way to get the dialog box to appear is to click on the Photoshop icon in the system tray. I am wondering if there is a way to fix this so that the dialog boxes are always on top ?
