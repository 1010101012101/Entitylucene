How To Fresh Install ML <body> I'm having some problems with entering sleep and wakening, so I'm considering making a fresh installation of Mountain Lion. How can I make a fresh install of ML? I have Bootcamp partition which I'd like to remove also.  Also, what is the procedure for fresh Lion install?(maybe I'll try installing this OS because in Lion I didn't have this problem).  BTW - I have ML downloaded through Apple Store because I bought the new laptop and I'm entitled for upgrading.  Thanks  <answer58369> A clean reinstall of Mountain Lion involves creating a bootable USB stick from the installer downloaded from the App Store. You would then boot from it by holding ALT (Option) while rebooting.  When you boot into the USB stick, use Disk Utility to delete both the Lion and Windows partitions from your drive.  As for clean reinstalling Lion, since it came pre-installed, you would have to backup your hard drive and 'erase' it which would then prompt you to reinstall the OS.  <answer58385> Or, if you have working (bootable) OS X on external (USB) Hdd, simply:  ul liTime Machine!!! (Don't forget backup) :)/li lidownload ML from Appstore/li liafter the download it start the installation/li liquit it/li limove the downloaded mountain installation app from /Applications into the external HDD/li lireboot mac/li lihold down ALT and boot the external USB/li liif want you can repartition the internal HDD with Disk utility.app (remember, you're booted from external HDD, so, want repartition the internal one...)/li lirun the copied installation app/li liselect your internal HDD as target/li liinstall/li lidone/li /ul  I'we done installation this way because i'm changed my HDD into SSD, so I used my old internal HDD as bootable external HDD...  <answer58417> If you are going to remove your Windows partition, you could also do the following :  ol liRemove the Windows partition using Disk Utility./li liCreate a new hfs+ partition in its place./li liUse Superduper or CarbonCopyCloner to backup your Lion install to new partition./li liBoot the backup./li liErase the original Lion partition/li liInstall Mountain Lion on the newly erased partition/li liWhen you've verified Mountain Lion works as expected, remove remaining Lion partition and grow Mountain Lon filesystem to full disk size./li /ol  You could skip steps 3,4,5 and just install Mountain Lion on the second partition but the advantage of doing it this way is that the OS files will be on the first partition, at the beginning of the disk which is most performant.  <comment67253> Thank you, I followed these steps, though I didn't remove the Bootcamp partition. Very happy result as it fixed my sleep-wakening problems. <comment67261> Glad to help. :)
