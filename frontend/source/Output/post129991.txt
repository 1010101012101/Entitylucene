packages installed with Homebrew not found after restore <body> I got a new Macbook Pro and restored from the backup, all of my packages are in still there and the path is still correct, but when I type a command that was installed on the previous system it returns an error. Take for example codepstree/code  precodepstree -bash: pstree: command not found /code/pre  Someone elsewhere on the internet suggested reinstalling them, but I have way too many packages installed to go thru them one at a time.  The computer is running Mavericks. I used migration assistant to restore from a time machine backup and codebrew doctor/code says my system is ready to brew.  <answer130993> I actually found a simple, and somewhat inelegant solution: I concatenated codebrew list/code into a file calledcodebrewback.txt/code then I wrote and executed the following script  precode    #! /bin/sh     cat brewback.txt | xargs -L1 brew unlink ;     cat brewback.txt | xargs -L1 brew link     echo "Done" exit /code/pre  I wanted to do both arguments in the same step, as in unlink then link the first program; unlink then link the second, etc. and if someone can describe how in a comment that would be greatly appreciated, then I will mark this problem as solved.  <answer131013> From your answer above, it looks like you want to relink all your kegs, which is already answered here:  Is there a quick way to relink my homebrew kegs?  In one line:  codebrew list -1 | while read line; do brew unlink $line; brew link $line; done/code  <comment152239> What OS on the Mac? Did you run `brew doctor` to make sure your path and the install is clean? You shouldn't need to reinstall the packages - but you might need to explain how you made a backup and how you restored it. <comment153062> Have you tried `ls /usr/local/bin` and `ls /usr/local/Cellar`? You should easily be able to see if your brew packages were copied.
