Apple Music: How to view the list of all loved items? <body> I'm kind of OCD and like to know what data is behind every recommendation system.  Is there a way to view all the loved (hearted) items (songs, playlists, etc.) in Apple Music?  I believe at worst case scenario one could just reset them.  <answer194259> If you are listening in iTunes you can make a smart playlist which automatically adds all loved songs to it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZd6A.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that this playlist will only contain songs that you "loved" on each respective device. I.e. if you love a song on your iPhone it will not appear in your "loved songs" smart playlist on your mac, or vice versa. This appears to be a syncing bug which may or may not be fixed one day.  <answer200678> Just figured this out myself today, so here's how to do it:  ol liClick the heart button (â™¥) to Love the song/li liClick the 3-dot button (...) and then click strongAdd to My Music/strong/li liCreate a Smart Playlist where "Loved" = "is true"/li /ol  Enjoy!  <comment231633> Thanks, but it displays only songs and only those were added to My Music. That playlist does not display any song that was loved from Radio or New section for example. <comment313995> This is a ridicules solution by Apple. It only shows stuff that you liked and that is inside your library, not what you liked on Apple music
