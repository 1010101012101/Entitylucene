IOS11: How to “unsnap” a slide over app <body> It’s easy to put app to the side in iOS 11, but how to un-pin it back? It always opens in this mini view.   I have an older iPad and I cant swipe down to put sideloaded app on the main screen. The only solution I could find is to sideload another app, but what if I don’t want anything there?  Just to reiterate - I want this app to be the main one. If I launch it from the Dock it opens in a slide-over state.  <answer288967> If what the OP means by "unsnap" is to dismiss the app, then to dismiss an app that has been pulled up from the dock as an overlay this procedure should work.  strongNote: iOS 11 is in Beta as of this writing and could change./strong  There is a 'Handle' on the top of the app.  Tap and hold to swipe the app to the right (off screen) thus dismissing the app.  emNotice in the animation below how the horizontal bar or handle at the top lightens as it is tapped for the drag off./em  To be sure that when opening the formerly overlaid app from the dock is not again an overlay, swipe it to the left side and then pull it down to the left in split view.  Move the separator all the way to dismiss the original app (that was underneath) and now the app will open full screen when opened from the dock or when tapping its icon on the home screen.  See animation below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZD6xn.gif" alt="Dismiss overlay app"  <answer290654> The solution that seem to be working is actually to go to the home screen and open the app from there.  <comment364968> Have you tried swiping off screen to the right? That dismisses the app usually with iOS 11.  (Grabbing the handle is a bit buggy) <comment364973> Swiping off the screen works fine. How to make it the main app again? <comment364976> You can swap it to the left side, then pull it down so that it is split then make it full screen.  I'll edit my answer.  Hope I'm following what you mean. Cheers <comment365011> Oh I see, so basically you can only drop it at the right side of the screen? <comment365028> Works for me on either side. Can dismiss by dragging off. This is beta software so results may vary
