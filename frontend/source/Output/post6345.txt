How to import a spreadsheet into Numbers from an email attachment?  <body> I want to know how to open a spreadheet email attachement in the Numbers app on the iPad.  Here are the steps I have taken with no luck:  ol liOn the iPad I open my email./li liI see a spreadsheet attachment./li liI click it and it previews./li /ol  Now how do I get the spreadhseet into Numbers?  The Apple directions say the following:  strong'OpenReceive as an email attachment. Preview the spreadsheet and tap the code“Open in”/code button to open Numbers.'/strong  emstrongMy problem/em/strong is I cant find the code"Open in"/code option on the iPad??  <answer6416> This screen shot is from Keynote for iPad, but Numbers for iPad is pretty much the same:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLDWQ.png" alt="Keynote iPad preview sshot"  When you view the file in Preview mode, the title bar of the document should look pretty similar to the above. Over there on the right is the kbdstrongOpen in…/strong/kbd button.  There emmight/em be a img src="https://help.apple.com/iwork/1.3/safari/English.lproj/Art/IL_MailExport.png" width="26" / button that you have to click first before you see the kbdstrongOpen in…/strong/kbd button.  Other ways to transfer files to your iPad:  ul liUse iTunes file sharing to import iWork documents/li liUse the iWork.com public beta/li liUse MobileMe iDisk or a WebDAV server/li /ul  <answer42373> ok the anwer is not to open the attachment. Touch and hold the closed attachment and then it will ask you if you want to open in numbers. Once you have done that it will save automatically.  <answer166666> New Answer:  1) Open the attachment:  2) Select the icon as if you were going to forward in mail:  3) I then received the option to mail, save in numbers etc.   I just saved an excel file to numbers on my IPhone 6.

Even [a Dropbox fangirl like me](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/423/what-are-good-web-based-workflow-solutions-for-graphic-designers/464#464) thought that, given four different ways to do one task, a fifth would be overkill ;-) . <comment6700> I hear ya. I just wanted to add the suggestion because iDisk costs money and setting up your own WebDAV server is a huge pain in the butt. :) <comment6720> You might just have to tap the screen once to bring up the title bar.
