Can I use 2 iPhones as walkie talkie? (without internet!) <body> I want to use 2 (or more) iPhones as walkie talkie (i.e. they talk each other without needing internet/voice call).  Of course this should work with wifi, because it doesn't make much sense a to have bluetooth or usb connection for this application...  <answer14876> There's an app for thatâ„¢.  strongWiChat/strong will allow you to chat with the emBonjour/em protocol, that is, chatting with people on the local network without connecting to an external server.  <answer14878> There are several apps that will do this in the iTunes Store. The search to use is "walkie talkie". I recommend you look first at Walkie-Talkie - iOS.   <comment16008> Nice, but this is for IM, not actual voice talk. <comment16082> The point here is someone doing [that search](http://appshopper.com/search/?search=walkie-talkie) and recommending a single good app that will do the job. <comment16174> This app http://appshopper.com/utilities/walkie-talkie-2 looks good. Please someone post this as answer so that I can accept it.
