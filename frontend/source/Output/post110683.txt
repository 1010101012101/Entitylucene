How do I use AFP with Back To My Mac? <body> When my Macbook and home Mac were running Mountain Lion, I used Back To My Mac to get to my home system and it showed me all of my drives if I logged in with my normal account credentials.  Since I've upgraded to Mavericks, it appears to be defaulting to Samba instead of AFP because I only see the single read-only SMB share I have set up, and I can't log in with my normal account user/pass.  When I'm at home, if I manually go to afp://ip.address/ it works fine.  Obviously that is not an option with Back To My Mac.  Does anybody know how I can get the afp-over-wan behavior back?  It was really handy!  <answer110697> You can find your Back To My Mac hostname by doing this:  precode% dns-sd -E Looking for recommended registration domains: DATE: ---Fri 15 Nov 2013--- 12:00:39.211  ...STARTING... Timestamp     Recommended Registration domain 12:00:39.212  Added     (More)               local 12:00:39.212  Added                          icloud.com                                              - &gt; btmm                                              - - &gt; members                                              - - - &gt; 1234567 /code/pre  Using that you can derive the hostname as codecomputer_name.1234567.members.btmm.icloud.com/code. Now use Finder's "Connect To Server..." command and enter codeafp://computer_name.1234567..members.btmm.icloud.com/code in the dialog box. It works! If your computer name has a space in it, replace it with a hyphen. The hostname should be all lower-case, so if your computer name is "My Mac" use codemy-mac.1234567.members.btmm.icloud.com/code.  (If your mac is running ssh, you can ssh to it as well, which opens a whole world of secure-tunnelling possibility!)
