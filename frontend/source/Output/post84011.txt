From this SO question:  In XCode 4, applications are exported from the "Organizer" and you build a code.app/code bundle for redistribution by building an archive of the application:  ul liOn the menu go to codeProduct/code - codeArchive/code/li liOnce you're in the codeOrganizer - Archives/code screen click codeDistribute/code button if you're using XCode 4.3.3 or higher, click the codeShare/code button for releases before 4.3.3/li liThen choose the format you want to export./li /ul
