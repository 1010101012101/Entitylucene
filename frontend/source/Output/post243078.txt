Where is the folder with color schemes used by vim? <body> I use vi on mac os x at work and on Ubuntu at home. I like the colorscheme vim uses on the mac and I'd like to copy the corresponding file on ubuntu, but I can't find it, since there's no ~/.vim folder. Searching on the web I always find the answer "create it", but this is not the point, since I just want to see (and copy) an already installed colorscheme.  <answer243156> I found the answer  here: color scheme's and syntax' files can be found in code/usr/share/vim//code.  <comment299332> I think they're located in $HOME/.vim/colors/ and you enable the one you want by editing $HOME/.vimrc file with "colorschemes name_of_scheme" (no quotations) <comment299351> As I already wrote, there's no directory with this name.
