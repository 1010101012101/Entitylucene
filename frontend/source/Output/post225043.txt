OS X El Capitan keeps changing the auto hide Dock feature <body> Up until recently I have had no issue with the Dock. I always leave it showing and don't have auto-hide enabled. Now whenever I switch program from Chrome to Skype or Terminal to System Preferences the Dock hides, even though I have never changed the setting to turn it on.   So far I've tried to fix this by right-clicking on the Dock separator and click Turn Hiding Off but it just changes back to Turn Hiding On once I switch programs.  I've also gone into System Preferences and selected "Automatically hide and show the Dock". I've also killed the dock to restart it which was suggested here.  I think I've run out of options to fix this. I'm not even sure why or how it started.   <answer248280> I found that one of my Spaces kept causing the Dock to auto hide, and prevented things like the app switcher and swiping between spaces to stop working. Other spaces did not cause the same thing to happen. By closing the offending Space, the problem went away.  <comment273079> Do you by accident use Command+Option+D for any purpose?  It's the standard Finder's shortcut to turn the auto-hiding on or off. <comment273080> Not that I know of, I only use shortcuts for chrome. The thing I don't get is that it just keeps switching the value as soon as I change program
