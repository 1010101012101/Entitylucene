Why does Apple make it so difficult? I guess it's yet another high profit money-spinner by Apple that forces us to go to an expensive Apple store and pay lots of money to a so-called "genius" salesman. Sigh. Looks like there's no way to change the ASIC Apple instructions - not the international language. That's a childishly simple and so obvious change, despite the inferences of the unnecessary illustrations here.
