When using CMD-Tab, how to re-open the app's main window? <body> I hit this problem often when interacting with some Apple applications, mainly strongMessages/strong and strongiTunes/strong.  After starting a song with iTunes, to clear my screen and get back to work I close the iTunes emwindow/em with kbdCMD-W/kbd. The iTunes emapplication/em is still running in my Dock and playing music.  After some time, I want to switch to a different album. I kbdCMD-Tab/kbd to select the iTunes application. iTunes is focused in the menu bar. But strongno window is shown/strong, because I previously closed the window.  This workflow occurs for all apps, and is not usually a problem. If I switch to Safari and no window is open, I simply press kbdCMD-T/kbd or kbdCMD-N/kbd to open a new tab or new window.  With iTunes, I press kbdCMD-N/kbd and nothing happens. No iTunes window is created or shown. The Application is focused, but the main window is not re-opened if it is currently closed.  I end up clicking on the Dock, which (in addition to focusing the application) opens a new iTunes emwindow/em if that window was previously closed.  This breaks my (usually more efficient) kbdCMD-Tab/kbd workflow. If I'm forced to click the iTunes dock icon, I may as well just click the dock icon from the start and forgo the keyboard shortcut.  Messages has a similar problem. If I receive a desktop notification and use kbdCMD-Tab/kbd to open Messages to respond, the application will be focused but no window will be opened. I can press kbdCMD-N/kbd, which in Message's case emdoes/em open a new window, but the "new message" cell will be opened rather than the existing conversation I had open and now want to respond to.  When clicking the Dock icon or opening the app via a Spotlight Search, if the main window is not open then it will be re-opened. Is there a way to force this behavior for kbdCMD-Tab/kbd app selection?  How do I show the main window when the Application is focused via kbdCMD-Tab/kbd?  <answer264861> There exists a shortcut for that, though it requires certain dexterity:  codeCmd-Tab/code to the app, but then, before releasing codeCmd/code, press codeAlt/code. Then release codeCmd/code while holding codeAlt/code. The window should pop open.  It's just like clicking in the app icon in the Dock (if there are no windows open, one opens; if there is a minimized window, it appears again).  <answer264869> Several applications including iTunes let you switch views by using codeCMD/code +code&lt;number&gt;/code.  codeCMD/code + code0/code will give you the main window. But some applications like iTunes offer different views.  Just try codeCMD/code+codetab/code to iTunes and then variate between codeCMD/code + code1/code to code9/code to see which view you like. In the screenshot below you can see the different options for iTunes. Messages only has the option codeCMD/code + code0/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fnhpH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment332050> Thank you, that definitely does work. Unfortunately it seems to require 2 thumbs! Additional answers that set a preference or remap that key would be appreciated, if anyone knows. <comment332052> [Hold Down the Option Key When Switching Between Apps on Mac To Pull Up a Minimized App](http://lifehacker.com/hold-down-the-option-key-when-switching-between-apps-on-1785805539) <comment332076> This is great! I was looking for a "Open Window"-type command that I could remap but was unable to find anything. In Messages it's `Window  Messages`. I'm going to remap that to CMD-1 and use that keyboard shortcut as "re-open the window" for all apps where I have this problem. It seems like many apps will have this command by default.
