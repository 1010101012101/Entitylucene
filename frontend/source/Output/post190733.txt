Why is htop producing different reports than Activity Monitor? <body> I'm using htop on my Mac. I put it side by side with Activity Monitor, but the reports are widely different.   On Activity Monitor, I can get finder using up to 100% of CPU, while it doesn't show at all the process on htop. Is there a better tool for monitoring processes for Yosemite?  <answer191416> In order to get accurate processes, cpu usage and accumulative time, the user running codehtop/code should be root. This is not the case with codetop/code, because it has the "set-user-ID-on-execution bit" (suid) set.  Execute codesudo htop/code from your user terminal or if you trust your local users add the suid to the binary (code# chmod u+s path-to-htop-binary/code).  <comment227281> Are you root when you run htop? <comment227302> No, I'm a user in the sudo group <comment227303> Than run 'sudo htop' and you will have task CPU usage and cumulative time. <comment227306> Makes sense. Do you want add it as an answer? I'll mark as it as such.
