Mavericks Download Icon Error <body> I just upgraded to OSX Mavericks and now when I try to download something the icon that shows a loading bar while it's downloading doesn't change back to normal after it's done:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nPfQE.png" alt="broken icon"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAe0f.png" alt="clearly downloaded"  I'm using the most up-to-date chrome and I changed my default download location to desktop (both of these have worked fine consistently in the past)  I can double click the zip and it unpacks totally fine, it really seems to just be the desktop icon, but it's still frustrating. Any ideas why this might be happening?  <comment139503> Is this only with the .zip files ? <comment139564> nope. jpg and pdf's too <comment139565> where did you get that square icon from ? <comment139569> what square icon are you talking about?
