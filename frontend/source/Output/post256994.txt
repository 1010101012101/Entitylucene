How can I discover the source of an alert chime on OS X <body> At irregular intervals, my MacBook Pro is emitting a chime. Not the startup chime. More of a brief "alert" type sound.  A few minutes will go by, no chime. Then chime, or several in a row. Then silence for a few minutes, etc.  I clicked notification center when it occurs to see what it's trying to alert me about. There are no notifications listed within the last hour.  I went through everything in notifications control panel and turned off audible alerts.  I turned on "do not disturb."  Power is 100%. Machine is plugged in. Light on power input is green.  Wifi is turned off. Ethernet connection is ok.  Retina MacBook Pro mid 2012.  OS X Sierra 10.12 (16A323).  <answer256997> I figured it out.  It was MS Outlook client.  Outlook ignores OS X notification center. Alert config is in Outlook application preferences.  <comment320693> Switch to Finder, press Cmd/Opt/Ctrl/Shift/B - does it make the same noise? <comment320695> What does that do? (Got a link to docs?) <comment320696> It's just a non-command, that ought to give the "you made an oops" system beep. <comment320697> No it isn't that one.
