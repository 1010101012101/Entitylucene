Unable to resize last partition on external drive <body> I have a 2 TB external USB drive partitioned into 3 "drives." Two are ~500 MB, the third ~1 GB. I have lots of spare space in the middle partition, so wanted to make it smaller and give that space to the third partition.  I was able to resize the middle partition smaller using Yosemite's Disk Utility. However, when I tried to enlarge the partition that was "last", i.e., the bottom of the partition diagram, to give it the now unallocated space, the sizing handle was at the bottom of the diagram and couldn't move down and I couldn't drag the start of the partition up in the diagram.  Can you only make a partition "longer" and not move the start or "head" of a partition? That's all I could think, but was unable to find any documentation on this. There is a box where you can enter a size value for the partition, but I was too chicken to try it without asking here first.  Thanks.  <answer274781> In Disk Utility a 2 TB disk with three partitions (2x500 GB &amp; 1x1 TB) looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bd3KD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  In Terminal and using codegpt/code you will get the following output:  precodesudo gpt -r show disk3        start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34           6                    40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       409640   976562504      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC    976972144      262144             977234288   976562504      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1953796792      262144            1954058936  1952044320      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   3906103256      262151            3906365407          32         Sec GPT table   3906365439           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  The partition with the index number 2 is Volume1, index number 3 is Volume2 and finally index number 4 is Volume3.

This can't be done with on-board tools like Disk Utility or command line tools like diskutil. 3rd party tools like iPartition or Stellar Partition Manager are capable of doing this though.  <comment345525> Thanks, lkanomath, I may look into iPartition, though this is the first time in many years I've wanted to repartition, so buying a 3rd-party app may be overkill.
