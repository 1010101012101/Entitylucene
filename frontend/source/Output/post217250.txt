That's exactly what I'm looking for but need the code adapted for my external drive & haven't got a scoobie. <comment262644> Please don't just say "this isn't a duplicate" instead explain precisely what you don't understand or can't implement. Help us help you by editing this to explain why you can't use the answers already posted. <comment262648> Thanks for the reply & sorry site noob.  What do I need to alter from line 4 for this to work with my external drive?  $ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX $ mv Data Data_bak $ ln -s /Volumes/SSD/QuicktimeScratch DataSSD $ ln -s Data <comment262702> sorry bmike I was using my iPhone to view & did not see the 2nd answer that involves 'users & groups' here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/139525/how-do-i-get-quicktime-to-store-temporary-recordings-on-another-drive      this worked perfectly.  what to I do now with my post as I've found a solution...delete it or keep it up for others?
