External disk takes a long time to appear in Finder <body> I'm running Mac OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) and it seems the larger the external disk I plug in, the longer it takes to show up in Finder.  A 2TB disk is taking almost a minute.  If I plug the same disk on a Windows or Linux PC, it shows up instantly.  Why does this happen on Mac? Is there an option or configuration to make the disk show up faster?  <answer291029> After upgrading to macOS Sierra, I uninstalled FUSE and ntfs-3g and started using the hidden NTFS support from Apple (through Mounty). The disk now mounts very fast, so I'm assuming it was the NTFS driver.  <comment360979> What's the format of the disk? <comment360980> What connection protocol? (USB, FireWire, SATA, Thunderbolt)? <comment361136> @Allan It's NTFS and I have FUSE for OS X installed. <comment361137> @IconDaemon USB <comment361206> Is it USB2 or USB3? <comment361320> @IconDaemon It's USB 2.0. I thought it could be related to Spotlight, but I disabled it and the problem remains. Also updated FUSE, no change.
