How do I change window size that is not Finder? <body> When I go to open in Photoshop or in FCPX or in other programs - window size is small.  Need the default to be larger. Any Ideas?  (I know how to resize Finder window)  <answer248925> Drag the sides or corners of the window to your desired size. This is remembered across application launches.  <comment308733> Hmm When I open to add a picture on FB it is still the same small size.. same in Photoshop so.. still not working.
