How to link gcc? gcc-7.1.0 already installed, it's just not linked <body> I download the gcc, use strongbrew install gcc/strong but it said the gcc did not linked. how to link the gcc? or what should I do?  <answer285054> When you install gcc with :  precodebrew install gcc /code/pre  it should be automatically linked. But, if for some reasons, it's not. You can link it manually with :  precodebrew link gcc /code/pre  The command :  precodebrew link --help /code/pre  gives also some valuable information :  precodebrew ln, link [--overwrite] [--dry-run] [--force] formula:     Symlink all of formula's installed files into the Homebrew prefix. This     is done automatically when you install formulae but can be useful for DIY     installations.      If --overwrite is passed, Homebrew will delete files which already exist in     the prefix while linking.      If --dry-run or -n is passed, Homebrew will list all files which would     be linked or which would be deleted by brew link --overwrite, but will not     actually link or delete any files.      If --force (or -f) is passed, Homebrew will allow keg-only formulae to be linked. /code/pre  <comment357089> I'd run the `brew doctor` command and fix anything it points up. However I just tried `brew install gcc` myself and it worked first time. Could you tell us the exact error message you're getting? Is it brew telling you that it didn't link or gcc telling you that?
