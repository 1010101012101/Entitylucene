Can TimeCapsule and Express both connect via ethernet to same network? <body> My home has ethernet in all the rooms, that connects back to the cable router/switch.  My Airport Time Capsule has good wifi coverage for all but one room.  Can I use an Airport Express for this room and connect that to the home network, via that room's ethernet jack?    I guess I am asking if both devices (Time Capsule and Express) can be connected to the same network via ethernet, rather that use the Express to "extend" the distance of the Time Capsule?    Is it possible? Does it cause any limitations? Any special set up needed?       Thanks.
