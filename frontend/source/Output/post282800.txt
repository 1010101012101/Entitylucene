Can I have a different $PATH variable for different folders? <body> I'm trying to run a different version of Maven for different projects. I have been running Maven 3.2 for all my other projects up until this point. But I was trying out a new project with a dependency on Maven 3.3. So I thought I updated it via brew, and it looked like that update to get the latest version succeeded, but then when I did mvn -version, it still reported 3.2.    Co-worker suggested checking $PATH variable, and sure enough, it had an entry to the location of Maven 3.2, which I would still like to keep for the other projects.    Is there a way to run different versions of Maven for different projects? How would I do that?  <comment356414> Possible duplicate- https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/245146/making-bashrc-function-callable-to-set-up-an-environment/245150#245150
