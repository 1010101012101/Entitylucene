What is the difference between `brew` and `brew cask`? <body> So, what is the difference between codebrew/code and codebrew cask/code?  I know that homebrew is a package management software. But what kind of software can I get there? Is it open source software and commercial software?  <answer125471> h2Homebrew/h2  codebrew/code is the core command for the Homebrew project.     The missing package manager for OS X      Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didn’t.   Homebrew typically deals with command line software. Most of the software is distributed under an open source licence. See the Formulas for a list of available installs.  h2Cask/h2  codebrew cask/code is an extension to codebrew/code that allows management of graphical applications through the Cask project.     Homebrew Cask extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity,   and speed to OS X applications and large binaries alike.   Cask deals with a mixture of software and licences. The software I work on is covered by a commercial licence and available via cask.  Cask offers a way to command line manage the installation of graphical applications.  h2Licensing/h2  Availability through codebrew/code or codecask/code does not imply any specific licence.  <answer293040> codebrew cask install foo/code appears to be a shortcut for codebrew install caskroom/cask/foo/code:  precodect@MBA45:~$ brew tap caskroom/cask homebrew/core homebrew/php ct@MBA45:~$ brew install meld Error: No available formula with the name "meld"  It was migrated from homebrew/core to caskroom/cask.

Graphical applications are suited to `brew cask` with everything else going through `brew`. <comment184562> macvim is available on both. There's even a warning about it in the cask package -- and yet they keep it available. I'm confused why cask exists. <comment184569> @Isaac consider opening an issue report to clarify the decision and maybe prompt the removal of one edition. <comment184579> Done. https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/7421 <comment202191> +1 @Isaac. As a new mac user coming from debian I can report "this is confusing to new mac users coming from debian." <comment248365> I am also trying to understand this - I did a `brew info node` (v .12) and a `brew cask info node` (v 4). There were also differen versions of mongodb (3.0.6 for brew, 3.0.5-build.1 for cask) and git (2.5.2 brew, 2.2.1 cask) - I don't really understand it.  Some things like chrome are only available via cask (which makes sense.) <comment270512> Reply to issue: "Keep in mind that there are many users that use homebrew-cask but not homebrew. We are different projects with different goals and maintainers, we do not coordinate with each other." <comment297301> I am afraid answer from @GrahamMiln is misleading... The key answer is in the linked discussion ([#7002](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/7002)): _The difference isn’t between binary and app, but between downloaded as source code that will be compiled, or as an already compiled package. The distinction is important because the result is different. brew install macvim takes (possibly way) longer to install then brew cask install macvim. The former provides flexibility, while the later provides speed._ <comment297323> Misleading or incorrect? My understanding is that `brew` can download precompiled or source versions of an application. Which depends on the recipe involved. However, please add your answer to this question – more than one answer is welcome! <comment363534> Homebrew actually publically prefers recompiled binaries (called "bottles) when possible also. See https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#why-do-you-compile-everything. So the distinction is even less clear, the reality is they do overlap.
