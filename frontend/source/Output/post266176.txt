Mac OS Extended Drive Password Format? <body> Merry xmas! I have lost the password of my external drive. I am wondering if anyone here knows the "format" of the password - I mean, when you set up a password - does the password require special characters, or certain length, or are there some characters required to be in upper case? I ask because if I know the format, perhaps it will jog my memory and I can figure out the password I used.   <comment333781> Usually there are **no** restrictions for passwords (except length 0 often). But: we don't even know the type of encryption. This may be Apple encryption or some custom other encryptions like WD Security, Seagate Secure etc. or independent schemes like TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt. <comment333815> What is the manufacturer of the external HD? You might want to contact the them to see what they can tell you. BTW/ Was this a FileVault password? If it was FV, try this tip [on this site.](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/09/22/fdesetup-authrestart-filevault-2s-one-time-encryption-bypass-feature/) I'm not sure it works on external FV disks, but it's worth a shot. <comment334035> If you set the password yourself for the drive, usually you can find it in the keychain.
