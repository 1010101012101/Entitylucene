Any way to turn on the reduced power mode a macbook uses under battery power, but while plugged into a power adapter? <body> I have an external battery rigged up for my MBP.  It goes through the magsafe adapter.   The battery is about twice the capacity of the internal battery.  The problem is, the macbook thinks it is plugged into AC, so undoubtedly the CPU is in full power mode.   It will gobble this big battery in under an hour.  I do have graphics set to integrated mode.  <answer235515> One option is to increase the niceness of the main CPU consuming processes. You can find these processes in the Activity Monitor or in the Terminal with this command:  precodetop -u /code/pre  If you find out that a process with pid codeP/code is the most CPU consuming one, then you can increase the niceness of that with this command in the Terminal:  precodesudo renice -n +10 P /code/pre  <answer239255> Unfortunately, there is no direct way to force OS X to use battery-power mode (here, here and here). OS X uses Intel Speedstep which changes the P-state of the processor depending on the computer's power status (AC/battery).  AFAIK, the only thing you can do is set your AC mode power management settings to the same as battery mode. Using codepmset/code, you can see and set the power settings that your Mac uses for AC and battery scenarios. Below is an example:  precode$ pmset -g custom Battery Power:  lidwake              1  autopoweroff         1  autopoweroffdelay    14400  standbydelay         10800  standby              1  ttyskeepawake        1  hibernatemode        3  powernap             1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  displaysleep         40  sleep                40  acwake               0  halfdim              1  lessbright           0  disksleep            10 AC Power:  lidwake              1  autopoweroff         1  autopoweroffdelay    14400  standbydelay         10800  standby              1  ttyskeepawake        1  hibernatemode        3  powernap             1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  womp                 1  displaysleep         180  networkoversleep     0  sleep                0  acwake               0  halfdim              1  disksleep            10 /code/pre  A brief run-through of the command:  codepmset/code: pmsetbr code-g/code: strongg/stronget settingsbr codecustom/code: displays custom settings for all power sources  To equalise your AC power settings with your battery consumption settings, you can use the following command:  precodepmset -g custom | xargs | cut -f1 -d'A' | cut -f2 -d':' | xargs sudo pmset -c /code/pre  A brief run-through of the command:  codepmset -g custom/code: see abovebr codexargs/code: converts entire output to one linebr codecut -f1 -d'A'/code: removes output following "A" of "AC Power:"br codecut -f2 -d':'/code: removes output preceding ":" of "Battery Power"br (example output as of this stage)  precode lidwake 1 autopoweroff 1 autopoweroffdelay 14400 standbydelay 10800 standby 1 ttyskeepawake 1 hibernatemode 3 powernap 1 hibernatefile /var/vm/sleepimage displaysleep 40 sleep 40 acwake 0 halfdim 1 lessbright 0 disksleep 10 /code/pre  codexargs pmset -c/code: passes the above argument line one by one to codepmset/code  Now, the output of codepmset -g custom/code looks like this:  precode$ pmset -g custom Battery Power:  lidwake              1  autopoweroff         1  autopoweroffdelay    14400  standbydelay         10800  standby              1  ttyskeepawake        1  hibernatemode        3  powernap             1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  displaysleep         40  sleep                40  acwake               0  halfdim              1  lessbright           0  disksleep            10 AC Power:  lidwake              1  autopoweroff         1  autopoweroffdelay    14400  standbydelay         10800  standby              1  ttyskeepawake        1  hibernatemode        3  powernap             1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  womp                 1  displaysleep         40  networkoversleep     0  sleep                40  acwake               0  halfdim              1  disksleep            10 /code/pre  Note that for similar properties that emhad/em different properties (i.e. codedisplaysleep/code, which had code40/code on battery and code180/code on AC), they are now the same.  hr  It is advisable to keep a backup of the original AC power settings in case you would like to revert. As follows, you can generate a string that you can use to reset your AC power settings with the following command:  precodepmset -g custom | xargs | cut -f2 -d'A' | cut -f2 -d':' /code/pre  The difference between this command and the one above is that with this command, we are taking the value emafter/em AC power (aka original AC power settings). To reset your settings to your original settings, take the string generated by the above command and pipe it through codexargs/code to codepmset -a/code:  precodeecho "[string generated by above command]" | xargs pmset -a /code/pre  hr  I would also advise following @gentmatt's tips in this answer to decrease power consumption.  <comment288041> What OS are you using and how old is the Macbook? <comment288062> @fbara 2012 MBP retina (id 10,1), el capitan 10.11.4
