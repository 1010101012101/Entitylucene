MacBook Pro USB Devices disabled - laptop cooler <body> I have been using a USB powered laptop cooler for a few months now and every time I plug it in it has been showing the warning "USB Devices disabled. Unplug the device using too much power to re- enable USB devices." and all USB devices have been working just fine. I haven't been able to spot any difference in the other USB devices' behavior therefore I wouldn't consider it a problem. I was just wondering whether it is something I need to pay more attention towards or it is just fine to leave it like that.
