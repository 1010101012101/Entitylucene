A file is already taken even though there is no such file <body> The name “bar_nearby_icon” with extension “.png” is already taken. Please choose a different name.  I got that message when I tried to change a file to bar_nearby_icon.png  But therre is no bar_nearby_icon.png  What should I do?  There was but I just deleted it.  <comment102471> Have you tried just relaunching Finder (by secondary-clicking the Dock icon while holding option and selecting Relaunch) or logging out and back in? <comment102473> Somehow it works I wonder what was wrong. The issue is not the fact that the file is hidden though.
