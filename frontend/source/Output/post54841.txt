Can't get 1680x1050 resolution with Macbook Pro ~2009 and Snow Leopard <body> I have a Late 2009 Macbook Pro with Snow Leopard (with all updates installed).  I have started my move from Windows to OS X as my everyday computing platform and I am trying to connect my external Samsung Monitor (that was used with Windows) to Macbook Pro using the mini DisplayPort to VGA connector.  For the life of me, I can't get OS X to set the monitor's native resolution of 1680x1050 setup. When the external display is auto-detected, the resolution is set up as 800x600.  I have tried using two different mini DisplayPort to VGA connectors and separate VGA cable to rule out the connector/cable issue. The monitors work fine as I have been using them with Windows 8 and they work perfectly fine (all autodectected).  My monitor's native resolution is 1680x1050 at 60Hz.   <answer56780> The issue is probably the VGA adapter (not faulty; just not capable of that high a resolution).  I think you need a DVI adapter to get the higher resolutions.  <comment65214> Oops - 3 weeks old question.  Answer still stands. <comment271613> http://superuser.com/q/527192/120614 suggests VGA should be fine for this resolution. <comment271614> And I've now successfully driven a monitor at 1680x1050@60Hz with an Early 2013 MacBook Pro over VGA, so it's not the VGA cable. <comment271615> The exact monitor type might help get answers here.
