Security not printing password stored in login keychain <body> For usage in a script, I need to extract a password from a keychain. The password was specifically (and manually) added for this very purpose for the account codeUser/code, with name codelabel/code.  However the results for extracting the password with codesecurity/code differ based on which keychain the password is added to. Using  precodesecurity find-generic-password -a User -l label -w /code/pre  will print the password only if it is stored in the codeSystem/code keychain, but result in an empty string if stored in the codelogin/code keychain, despite no error message showing up (as I would e.g. receive when a password cannot be found due to inexistent codelabel/code). Printing the information only, via  precodesecurity find-generic-password -a User -l label /code/pre  results in the same details list independently of which keychain is used.  Since the script is meant for a specific user and to be run on login of said user, it would make more sense to have the password in the user's login keychain. Same problem appears for a test keychain I added under the user's account.  The results are independent form the codeAccess Control/code settings in codeKeychain Access/code.  So: How to extract a password form any given keychain? Why does it succeed for the codeSystem/code keychain only?  OS-version: macOS sierra 10.12.3  <comment344428> Its working fine on 10.12.4 Beta
