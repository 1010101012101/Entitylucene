What is the maximum RAM size for MacBook Pro Mid 2012? <body> As everybody knows, the older Macs don't perform well. For improving this I inserted an 256 GB SSD. But, I need to upgrade my RAM. What is the limit that this computer supports? Which size can I upgrade the most?  <answer258151> The Mid 2012 MacBook Pro can support up to 16GB of RAM by using 2 8GB kits. Both the Retina and non-Retina models (mid 2012) support 16GB of RAM.  Per EveryMac.com, you can have img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4roEy.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have personally used the Kinston KVR16LS/8 modules many times with great results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLZeYm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Since, you said that you already upgraded your drive to an SSD, I assume you know how to remove the bottom cover to access the memory.  <answer258152> Your question doesn't specify which model of MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) you're asking about and the answer may be different depending on model. I summarise this below:  strongMacBook Pro (15", Mid 2012)/strong  This model has two memory slots capable of taking 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM memory chips. Officially (i.e. according to Apple) these models only support 8GB of RAM. However, real world tests have proven that they can actually support 16GB of RAM.  See these MacBook Pro: How to remove or install memory for instructions.  strongMacBook Pro (Retina, 15", Mid 2012)/strong  This model has no memory slots and came with either 8GB or 16GB of onboard memory installed. You cannot upgrade the memory on this model.  strongMacBook Pro (13", Mid 2012)/strong  This model has two memory slots capable of taking 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM memory chips. Officially (i.e. according to Apple) these models only support 8GB of RAM. However, real world tests have proven that they can actually support 16GB of RAM.

See [ask] for tips. <comment322627> @fsb, Doesn't matter what Mid 2012 MacBook Pro model as all three can handle 16 GB RAM <comment322628> @user3439894 The reason for my comment was to help a new user understand the best way to ask questions here. <comment322629> Hi Allan, thanks for the answer. I've read an article that is located on the Apple Support Communities website and they say that my MacBook pro only supports 8 GB of RAM but you can insert an 16GB one but it will not give the best performance. I've already ordered [link] (https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-DDR3L-1600-SODIMM-Memory-CT2K8G3S160BM/dp/B008LTBJFW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477055101&sr=8-1&keywords=macbook+pro+mid+2012+ram) 2 kit RAM last week but it takes a long time shipping. <comment322631> Yeah, I know removing the back cover. Thanks for the edited answer @Allan :D Appreciate it. <comment322632> Have a look at: [Crucial 16GB Kit (2 x 8GB) DDR3L-1600 SODIMM Memory for Mac](http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/macbook-pro-%2813-inch-and-15-inch%2C-mid-2012%29/CT3373650) <comment322633> Doesn't matter what Mid 2012 MacBook Pro model as all three can handle 16 GB RAM <comment322634> Yeah, thanks for the answer Monomeeth. I'm currently new in this community and I need learn some writing basics. I'm currently improving myself about this subject. My mac was the third (MacBook Pro 13", Mid 2012). I've ordered one through amazon last week, a 2 8GB kit to enable. I will use them. Thanks for the answer again. <comment322635> No problem...Do you know if you have a Retina or the non-Retina mid 2012? <comment322636> @user3439894 Thanks for the suggestion. I've already ordered that and it's shipping next week. In the product page, they wrote that Crucial supports my MacBook for this RAM. But when I controlled the official Apple page, they only insert 8. Asked the question for this. <comment322637> @user3439894 Yes, they can all support 16GB. However, one of the mid-2012 models came with onboard RAM and no memory slots. It does support 16GB as long as you purchased it that way. So, if the OP had this particular model, they wouldn't be able to upgrade the RAM. <comment322638> @fsb thanks for your help about teaching me writing a new post. I'm new here (as you know) so I need some tips. I have a blog but blog and a forum is a different thing. Next time I'll provide more info. Thanks for helping... <comment322639> You said, "_The Retina model can only support up to 8GB of RAM._", the MacBook Pro Retina 15" Mid 2012 ships with either 8 or 16 GB PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3L on-board memory. See : [MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) - Technical Specifications](https://support.apple.com/kb/sp653?locale=en_US) <comment322640> @user3439894 Yes, they can all support 16GB. However, one of the mid-2012 models came with onboard RAM and no memory slots. It does support 16GB as long as you purchased it that way. So, if the OP had this particular model, they wouldn't be able to upgrade the RAM. <comment322641> @Allan of course, it's the non-retina one. <comment322642> @user3439894 - that was an error that I already fixed.  I misread the late 2012 and caught my error when I double checked. <comment322643> @Arda√áebi - I edited my answer to be more accurate. <comment322644> @Allan, When I read the answer the information was as I quoted it and was not yet fixed, stop making excuses, I commented so you'd correct it, that's all and you did!
