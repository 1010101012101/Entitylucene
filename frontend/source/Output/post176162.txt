Is JMicronATA.kext part of Yosemite? And others <body> There is a file JMicronATA.kext in my GF's iMac in /System/Library/Extensions ... is this an official part of OS X? Or can it be deleted? I ask because its modification date is 2012 and in System Report it shows that it's Not Signed and not loaded.   As well there are these kexts in /Library/Extensions which do not show to be from Apple, are not loaded, and many are from 2013:  ACS6x.kext AcrMSR.kext ATTOCelerityFC8.kext ATTOExpressSASHBA2.kext ATTOExpressSASRAID2.kext CalDigitHDProDrv.kext HighPointIOP.kext HighPointRR.kext PromiseSTEX.kext SoftRAID.kext  What are all these and why are they in /Library/Extensions instead of /System/Library/Extensions if they are officially part of OS X Yosemite? If they're not, how can I identify where they came from? Why would they still be there after I just reinstalled Yosemite yesterday?  How can you tell what's an official part of the system, and what isn't? How can you uninstall 3rd party crap, short of rooting out individual files from within alllll of the folders in the three different Library folders, not to mention anything hidden in the /private directory??  Thanks.  <answer176164> It's the kernel extension for JMicron SATA controllers, and yes it's official, as are the others. It's up to you if you want to delete them, I wouldn't bother as they take up minimal space. Check System Profiler before doing anything silly just to make sure your iMac doesn't require any of the listed extensions.

The best way to know if it is from Apple is to read the codeObtained from:/code field. For example JmicronATA.kext has:  precodeObtained from: Not Signed /code/pre  Not:  precodeObtained from: Apple /code/pre  As a general rule you don't want to be using unsigned Kernel Extensions just like you don't want to be using Apps from unidentified developers. It is probably a good idea to disable unsigned extensions.  h1Disabling a Kernel Extension/h1  Before disabling an unwanted KEXT check that the codeLoaded:/code field has codeNo/code, that way we know for sure that it is not being used. I strongly advise not to ever disable Apple KEXTs, even if they read codeLoaded: No/code.  Next we open a terminal and change into the folder that contains the KEXTs:  precodecd /System/Library/Extensions/ /code/pre  Now rename the unwanted extension to have code_DISABLED/code on the end. (I don't think it matters what is on the end, but I did not have time to test.):  precodesudo mv SiLabsUSBDriver64.kext SiLabsUSBDriver64.kext_DISABLED /code/pre  h1About KEXTs/h1  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/Extend.html  http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/01/what-are-kexts.html  <comment207930> Did you make a good back up ? <comment207931> see this http://superuser.com/a/841943 <comment207932> How do you know it's official? Why isn't it signed? Why was it last updated two years ago? <comment207933> Yeah there is a backup. Thanks for the superuser link. <comment207936> The ATTO stuff is from here http://www.attotech.com/products/ <comment207937> While you're unlikely to need some of these extensions, if you had a Mac Pro (as an example of a system where you had the option of fitting expansions) these extensions would be loaded as needed - and are the reason why no drivers are required for many 3rd party expansions/peripherals. As an example, there are a number of ExpressCard34 eSATA adapters available using the JMicron 3xx chipset. Put one of these cards in a pre-Unibody MacBook Pro and it will simply work, no extra drivers required. <comment207938> I know it's official because it's a standard part of the OS X installation, and is present on the system in front of me right now. No idea why it's not signed though... <comment207943> There are newer versions of this driver out there, weird that they'd include an older one, but OK. So short of keeping another computer somewhere with a virgin copy of OS X to refer to, or posting here, how can I know what is official Apple and what is third-party? <comment288585> Actually apple ships this unsigned kext
