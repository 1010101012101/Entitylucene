How to use Emacs shortcut key in Mac OS? <body> I know Mac OS supports to some Emacs short-cut key to move cursor in text editor, e.g. Command + f/b/p/n to move cursor left/right/up/down, Command + v to page-down. In Emacs Meta + v is page-up, however the Option + v in Mac OS does not page up but instead print 'âœ“'.   What should I set in Mac OS to make Meta + v works in Mac OS? My OS is Yosemite.  <answer256901> You have to open the Terminal Settings and then you can enable "Use Option as Meta key"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcJ08.png" alt="enter image description here"
