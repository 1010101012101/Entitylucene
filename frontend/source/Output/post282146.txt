MBP A1502 late 2013 Ubuntu installation without SSD and OS X <body> I have a MacBook Pro (bought in 2013) and I have accidentally fried the internal SSD. Now I don't want to buy new SSD as it is very expensive. I want to install ubuntu on external HDD and want to use as my permanent disk. I have already made the ubuntu bootable USB and I can now run the Linux without installing it. The problem is that I could not install it on the same USB because it doesn't show in the disk list.  Also, how can I make sure that every time I turn on the laptop, it starts automatically with ubuntu when HDD is connected (boot order)  Kindly answer me as I am very new to ubuntu.
