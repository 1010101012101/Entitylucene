Why can't I access all commands in recovery mode? <body> When I'm trying to run terminal commands in recovery mode on my MacBook Pro, most commands just won't work even if I'm root (the last character of the default(PS1) prompt is a '#'). So why is this and can I fix it?  <answer289018> The recovery partition is a bare-bones version of macOS which can be used as for various things, such as installing macOS again or disable SIP (system integrity protection). To keep the recovery partition small, Apple decided to not include all CLI tools that are available in macOS.  For security reasons, not every user is able to access all files. The root user should be able to access all files and run all programs. It's a permission issue. However, he's not able to run programs that don't even exist on the recovery partition, so changing the user to root won't help you.  If you do want to use those programs, you shouldn't be using the recovery partition anyways but boot a standard macOS partition.  <answer289019> Terminal only provides a subset of commands while in Recovery mode, but it can't be fixed because that's Apple's design. I've done a little Googling to find out exactly what is disabled, but I found nothing definitive. I can surmise that some commands are disabled because they require certain macOS service that are not running in Recovery mode as well as a host of kernel extensions not being loaded. The Recovery macOS is clearly a subset of the full macOS.  I would also surmise that the available commands are the ones only useful (per Apple's wisdom) during a system recovery, such as disabling SIP, disk utility, password resets, etc.  <comment365033> What commands are you trying to use while in recovery mode, some commands may be unavailable because it is essentially a stripped down version of macOS. <comment365034> @bret7600 I tried to use env etc. but probably it's because of, as (at)Aniempje said, it only has the most basic stuff. <comment365076> The "commands" aren't really "disabled" - they don't exist in the system's path (/bin:/sbin:/local/bin etc) to keep a low footprint. A lot of missing commands can be executed if you launch them from the main volume (e.g. /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/usr/local/bin/...). Some commands in the main volume paths are not available/fail to launch because they rely on additional libs/frameworks which don't exist in the recovery system.
