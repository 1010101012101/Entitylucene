Unable to find my Mac OS operating system in /dev/disk0 <body> I have issues similar to this case :  Accidently deleted some small sized partitions when installing WIndows(Bootcamp). OSX Partition wont boot  I was installing Windows 10 into my laptop using bootcamp and deleted some partitions which I thought it was unnecessary. And now the only option I have is to boot into Windows OS. I followed the method as shown in the link above but apparently my Mac OS is not inside the disk0, I am very sure that I did not delete the Mac OS and I only delete the small partitions. I am currently running Mac OS Sierra. Is it because it is hidden? I have really important unsaved documents inside my operating system and I would be really glad if someone could offer me some help!  Sorry I am a complete beginner and have no idea how to solve this problem.   Here I attach with the screenshot I took:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ml0Y.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer283540> According to your screenshot, it looks like you deleted your main OS X partition and the recovery partition. You may very well have destroyed your data.  There is a glimmer of hope though. The numbers don't add up. It's a 250GB drive but the Windows partition is only 70GB. There's ~180GB of space unaccounted for, which might be the partitions you deleted. It's tough to say without knowing the exact steps you took.  You can try to use a partition recovery program like TestDisk to get them back.  I could tell you more of you post a screenshot of the output of the following command:  precodesudo gpt show /dev/disk0 /code/pre  <comment357505> Please add the output of  `gpt -r show disk0` to your question. <comment357506> You don't need to use `sudo` when running from the Recovery HD. <comment357507> Please comment the question instead of asking for screenshots **in your answer**! <comment358054> Dear all, I contacted apple support and they confirmed that I have accidentally deleted my hard disk. I did a clean restore and lost all my data == Thanks for all your help!
