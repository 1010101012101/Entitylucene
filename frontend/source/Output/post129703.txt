Font rendering issue with Word 2011 and 3rd party font (Admiration Pains) <body> I downloaded the Admiration Pains font, installed it via Font Book, and verified it works fine in applications like Adobe CS and TextEdit. Unfortunately, when I try to use the font in Microsoft Word 2011, the font renders as some generic font (e.g. Times New Roman).  When I highlight the text, Word still reports the font family as Admiration Pains.    Things I've tried with no success:  ol liRestarting Word;/li liDeleting the Font Cache file and restarting Word;/li liChanging font size;/li liLooked for "enabled duplicates" in Font Book;/li liConfirmed font is enabled in Font Book and that it Validates w/out issue;/li liUsing Font Nuke to remove all caches of fonts and restarting computer./li /ol  Any ideas on how I can get this font to render properly in Word?  Here's a screenshot of the font trying to be used, where it renders fine in the font drop down, but not in the document: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CGqc2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer129740> My workaround was to use FontForge to open the TTF file and then re-generate the font family in TrueType format. Now Word 2011 shows it correctly.
