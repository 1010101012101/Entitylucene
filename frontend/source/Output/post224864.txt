Can't install Homebrew on OSX <body> I am trying to install Homebrew on OSX El Capitan.  All latest OSX and Xcode updates have been installed.  I am using this command in terminal:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  And I get this response:  precodecurl: (1) Protocol "https" not supported or disabled in libcurl /code/pre  Elsewhere I read that you can run this command to fix:  precodesudo port install curl +ssl /code/pre  But this gave me:  precodesudo: port: command not found /code/pre  Can anybody help?  <answer224873> I am summarising my answer from comments.  In your case it seems that something has installed a version of curl without into https support into your local folder. Maybe you tried to compile it yourself (the standard code.configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install/code procedure installs programs into code/usr/local/code for example.  You can force the command to use system curl by replacing codecurl/code by code/usr/bin/curl/code in it, thus use:  precoderuby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  When you have Homebrew successfully installed you can re-install the curl in your local folder by using:  precodebrew install curl /code/pre  There might be some additional steps as you have to overwrite files that are already there. You might need to use the code--overwrite/code option.  <comment272717> Did you install curl from any source? What output do you get if you type `which curl` in the terminal? The port command is from macports which is a tool similar to homebrew. I would not recommend using both at the same time. <comment272718> For which curl I get /usr/local/bin/curl.  I don't believe I have installed another curl (i don't even know what curl is). <comment272719> Okay, it seems that "something" has installed a curl in your local folder. Try using the command you used before but instead of `curl` use `/usr/bin/curl` to use the system version. <comment272720> That worked!  How odd - do you know how I can remove this other curl?
