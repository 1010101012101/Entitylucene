Amazon MP3 files skipping parts when played on iPod touch <body> I have some music that I bought through Amazon MP3. Whenever I try to import them to iTunes so I can listen to them on my iPod, each song on the iPod is missing 10 seconds. It just completely skips 10 seconds and then continues playing. It's not always at the same point either. Sometimes it's the very first 10 seconds and sometimes it's 10 seconds in the middle of the song.  When I listen to the songs on iTunes, the songs do not have this problem. Also, songs directly downloaded from iTunes do not have this problem.  Any idea what's causing this problem?  I have iTunes 10.5.2.11 and and a 4th Gen iPod touch.  <comment57393> Have you tried shutting it all the way down (i.e. holding the top button for a few seconds and doing the "slide to power off" swipe)? No idea if that would do anything, but it's worth a shot if you haven't tried it already. <comment57443> Yeah I've tried that. I suspect it's something deeper than that.
