Is there a way to replay old sketches on my Apple Watch? <body> I naturally think of sketches like SMSs - you have a sequence of the old ones lying around you can peruse.   The other model of online messaging is snapchat, where your messages disappear after sending.   I've got a couple of sketches from a friend I'd like to replay - I'm wondering if this is possible, or I'm just thinking in the 'wrong model'.
