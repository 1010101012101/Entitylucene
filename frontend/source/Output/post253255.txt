Unable to use auto layout (ctrl + drag) on xcode after some time of using <body> I am having a problem with Xcode. It works correctly but sometimes after a period of using it, when I ctrl + drag an element on Interface Builder autoLayout popup shows and disappears immediately. Also, when I want to set constraints manually, I can't do that, because every single click is recognized as a double click as shown in the gifs below.  I tried to find the cause of this, but I can't. To solve it I have to restart /logout every time which is annoying. I observed that in most cases this starts when I connect external monitor to my MBP and use Xcode on that screen. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N9QQr.gif" alt="Can&#39;t set value, because xcode recognize simple click as double click"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AQsl0.gif" alt="Can&#39;t ctrl + drag because contraint popup instanetely dissappears"  <answer253264> Another person, had this same problem where performance plummeted on an external display.  What I ended up discovering was that the external monitor issue was indicating that there was a UIView that interface builder couldn't quite figure out properly for auto-layout.  In his case it was a codeUIToolbarBarItem/code that contained a UIView that contained a UILabel. Once I removed the offending codeUIToolbarBarItem/code the performance issue resolved itself. It went from being completely unusable to smooth scrolling.  You should check if you have a UIView inside something that might cause auto-layout to perform poorly.  <comment315179> Unfortunetely it's not project based, because after it starts, it happens on every project. Restarting/ force quiting xcode does not help. Only full restart/logout + login works. <comment315184> What are you running it on and how big is the difference in performance compared to without the external. Either way, the external is a common factor, so it seems. Also, have you viewed activity monitor while using the program under normal conditions?
