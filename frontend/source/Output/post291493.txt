Server-side copy on SMB share via command line <body> I need to copy a large number of files and folders from one folder to another on the same SMB share exposed by an Isilon server featuring server-side copy. Copying individual files and folders through the Finder window works fine, almost instantaneously, and does not cause any significant network traffic, thus I assume that here server-side offloading works. However, when I try to copy files from the terminal, my network traffic goes up and the throughput is accordingly low.  The share is mounted as follows:  precode$ mount //my.name@server/RemoteFolder on /Volumes/RemoteFolder (smbfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by my.name) /code/pre  I tried to copy via the command line using codecp/code, codescp/code, codeditto/code, and codersync/code to no avail, e.g.,  precode$ cp -vpRi "/Volumes/RemoteFolder/old/Peter Gabriel/" "/Volumes/RemoteFolder/groups/genesis/peter.gabriel" /code/pre  How can I imitate the behaviour from option-drag &amp; drop through the Finder in the command line?  Grateful for any hints!  <comment368011> Are you sure that Findet actually *copies* (duplicates) the files and doesn't just move them? <comment368018> Yes, I'm sure. Both `CMD+C`/`CMD-V`ing as well as option-drag copies a folder I use for testing with about 300 MB in a few seconds, while `cp` et al. takes almost one minute. <comment368028> Are you using `SMB2` to mount and have you tried scopy from smbclient?
