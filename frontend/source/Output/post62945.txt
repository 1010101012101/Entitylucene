How to use Cocoa Emacs as editor for Mutt <body> I'm taking yet another run at Emacs.  I've installed Cocoa Emacs, and so far so good.  Now I'd like to use Cocoa Emacs as my  editor for Mutt.  With MacVim,  it's trivial to use Macvim, i just put:  set editor="vim -o -f"      # editor to use when composing messages  in my .muttrc, and everything works.  When I want to compose a mail, I type m in Mutt and a new Macvim window opens on top, when I quit, I'm in the Mutt mailing screen (where I can put in cc, attachments, and type y to send).  When I've found anything about using emacs with Mutt it's always been a very complicated explanaition.  Surely there is a simple way to get emacs to do this?

The editor itself can remain active all the time (because you may have it open for other things as well) and you use a utility called codeemacsclient/code to connect to it (pass a file to edit) if you need it.  Add the following line to your config file (.emacs):  precode(server-start)  ; Starts server for (among others) emacsclient /code/pre  Or, if you don't wish to keep the server for emacsclient running at all times, you may issue the command codeM-x server-start/code to emacs when you're ready to run. Issuing that command is probably the right thing to do when you're already running emacs, unless you want to reload .emacs.  All you have to do now is to make sure that MUTT uses emacsclient as its editor. You can do this by adding the following line to your config file (.muttrc):  precodeset editor="emacsclient" /code/pre  Recent versions of mutt (at least 1.4.1) require the following format:  precodeset editor="emacsclient %s" /code/pre  Source: Emacs and MUTT  h2Starting Emacs every time/h2  precodeset editor="emacs %s" /code/pre  <comment72770> This works.  At the moment I'm using "emacs %s" version, although I have to give complete path.  I have a few  other issues, but they will be topic for future questions if I don't resolve them!
