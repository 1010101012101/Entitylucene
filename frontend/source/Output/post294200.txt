MBP E2015 Sierra keyboard/trackpad unresponsive <body> My Early 2015 13" MBP's keyboard and trackpad quit working a few days ago. I thought it might be the logic board. But itâ€™s definitely not. The power button (on the keyboard) works fine.   I tried a few things (below) more than a handful of times. Eventually, I realized I could just plug in an external USB keyboard &amp; mouse. By that time my Mac was trying to get me to disable FileVault in some weird boot mode that I've never seen. So I did.   Things I've tried:  ul liSMC reset (actually worked -- confirmed with the power adapter light)/li liPRAM reset &amp; strongall other boot options/strong -- totally unresponsive/li liused codenvram -c/code in the terminal to reset the PRAM -- verified this worked /li lidisabled filevault -- nothing/li libooted into USB installer to test keyboard and mouse -- nothing/li /ul  None of the above things worked -- I also tried various SMC resets and PRAM resets after each steps and in different orders.  Here's the important thing: strongeven with an external keyboard, no boot options work... except SMC resets./strong Which leads me to ask... is something wrong with the kernel?  I've tried safe boot, verbose boot, PRAM resets, recovery mode all from on computer keyboard and external keyboard. Nothing is responsive at time of boot.   I should note, I'm writing this from the MBP with external keyboard &amp; mouse.  <answer294207> I did some research and apparently, the early 2015 MBP is known for having trackpad/keyboard cable issues. I reset the cable and boom it works!
