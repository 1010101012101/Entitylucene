How to get the temperature of MacBook hardware without extra software? <body> We can use iStat Menus and other software.   Is it possible to get the temperature of MacBook hardware components without extra software? To use only programs already installed/delivered with MBP?  <answer291511> There seems to be no discernable way to find the temperature of hardware components purely without 3rd party software.

Its about command line, which I would like to avoid if possible. The answers contain also deprecated software. <comment368053> I;m guessing this is right. The API arenâ€™t around to easily script this. Now - there always is a python script that basically uses the objectiveC bridge to basically re-implement the third party apps that read the raw data and recreate temperature values from the built in sensors.
