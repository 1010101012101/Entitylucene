Siri does not recognise the relation to contacts <body> On my iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 11 Beta, Siri doesn't recognise my contacts. I have my family members in my contact details but when I ask Siri to call any it says that no number found, still it calls the same person if I say the person’s actual name.  I would like to make it so Siri will be able to respond to “Call Mom” etc. Is there a way to force this function to work?  <comment367266> I am confused - you say Siri won't call, then you say it does? What is your issue - "when I ask SIRI to call any it says that no number found , still it normally calls the same person if I DIRECTLY SAY THE NAME" <comment367270> Are you saying that if you say call "wife" or call "mum", Siri does not work. But if you say "call Your Mum's name" or "call your wifes name" it works? <comment367320> Wondering if this is just a nickname - configuration setting... https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/251075/is-siri-able-to-recognise-a-contact-nickname-and-action-on-it?rq=1 <comment367590> It's a Nick name issue though tried to edit my profile without success it's still the same .
