An US iPad Air 2 warranty work in Brazil? <body> Im about to go to US, and I was thinking about buying an "iPad Air 2", but Im worryed if, for some reason, Its needed to use the warranty. Could I do this in Brazil or would I need to send it back to US for that?...  ...also, does the warranty work the same way for refurbished iPad Air 2?  Will the warranty be valid in Brazil?  <answer238384> Apple has fantastic warranty service. Now I can't actually speak for Brazil but I do know that they do have a very fast mail in warranty system. That should do the trick or if you have a local apple store you can bring your iPad into their. Apple warranty is worldwide.
