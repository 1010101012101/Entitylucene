Is Cmd+F10 that mute the Mac a built-in OS X keyboard shortcut? <body> I just discovered that the combination of Cmd+F10 (without any Fn key pressed) muted my mac. I wanted to know if it was a built-in keyboard shortcut as it does not appear in the System preferences.  <answer143612> If you have 'Use all F1, F2 keys as standard functions' unchecked, that's the behaviour.br With or without the Cmd key, F10 mutes. Incidentally, so does Ctrl/F10 or Shift/F10.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hl6S.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment169132> That's exactly my settings. Thank you.
