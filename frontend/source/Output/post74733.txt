Finding original files in the Mac OS X installer <body> I messed up my Apache config file, stronghttpd.conf/strong.  hr  I followed this article, http://emresaglam.com/blog/1035, to try and find the original stronghttpd.conf/strong inside strongInstall OS X Mountain Lion.app/strong.  The article says that the Bom files ("Bill of Materials"), "describes what is in this pkg file and where they will be written to."  codeInstall OS X Mountain Lion.app -&gt; Contents\SharedSupport\InstallESD.dmg -&gt; Packages\***.pkg -&gt; Bom/code  However, the Bom files don't seem to be a complete listing. I extracted the contents of the strongPayload/strong for strongEssentials.pkg/strong and there was more to it then listed in its strongBom/strong.  hr  Is there a better way to navigate and find the file I need from the installer, besides extracting the contents of each pkg file's Payload? Any tips or resources would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!  <answer74804> When I first commented on your question, I was hindered by not having discovered httpd.conf on my own system. Now I have found it, however, and I can find out what packages owns it as follows:  precode; pkgutil --file-info /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf volume: / path: /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf  pkgid: com.apple.pkg.BSD pkg-version: 10.8.0.1.1.1306847324 install-time: 1352382423 uid: 0 gid: 0 mode: 644 /code/pre  Note: codecom.apple.pkg.BSD/code is a empackage name/em, not a emfilename/em. You can find a list of all packages that codepkgutil/code knows about by running  precodepkgutil --packages /code/pre  Also note that running the above command on code/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code does not yield a useful result, because code/etc/code is a symbolic link to code/private/etc/code.  <comment86880> I think maybe you are not findind the file because it is not in the distribution. I suspect that some other program builds it when needed. As evidence, I offer the fact that `pkgutil --files com.apple.pkg.Essentials | grep httpd.conf` does not print anything. <comment86892> @harald-hanche-olsen Thank you! I'm so stupid for not looking to see what else `pkgutil` does. I found **httpd.conf** in BSD.pkg using `pkgutil --payload-files ... | grep httpd.conf`. If you post your comment as an answer, I'll mark it as answered, thanks! Also, I'm curious where I can find the file you refer to in your comment, `com.apple.pkg.Essentials`. <comment86913> I posted a somewhat different answer, as I discovered more information. Sometimes, it seems that computers are *designed* to make us feel stupid â€¦
