What do the different colors of the tab title in iTerm2 mean? <body> While using iTerm2, I have noticed that sometimes the color of the title of a tab changes to pink with a loading indicator or changes to red. What do these things mean?  <answer81081> The iTerm strongcolor change/strong of Tab labels strongindicates activity/strong.  It can be turned of in: Preferences  Appearance  Color tab labels on activity  The help file explains this "Color tab labels on activity" appearance preference as follows:     If selected, tab labels become purple when a non-selected tab has new   output, and red when a non-selected tab has output you haven't seen   but that is not very recent.   <comment153245> Is there some way to configure what it considers "output"? I have tabs that turn colors all the time when there are no apparent changes in output.  This makes it useful, for example, to watch for changes in a chat in another tab.
