Share shell script: file permissions question <body> I'm on Mountain Lion 10.8.5 and recently I've made a small shell script which just shows a message on the screen. To run it, I had run  precodechmod +x test-script.sh /code/pre  and then using codesh ./test-script.sh/code ran it successfully. So if I want to send this to friends, do they have to run codechmod/code again? If so, how can I prevent it?  <answer104741> You can instruct your friends to run it using codesh ./test-script.sh/code. That would not require a codechmod +x/code to be done.  If your friends also use OS X, another alternative is to package it as an app with codeAutomator/code using the strongRun Shell Script/strong action and share that with your friends. In this case the user can run it just like any other application on the system.  See Creating Shell Script Actions in the Automator Programming Guide.  <comment123187> You should not have had to do the `chmod` if in fact you ran it by `sh ./test-script.sh`.  The `sh` will read the file and run it regardless if the execute flag is set or not.  You only need the execute flag if you run it directly, like `./test-script.sh` <comment123192> @Kent Can you say whether the file permissions will be preserved if the file is copied to a different machine? <comment123198> Not really.  It depends on many things.  If it is sent as a single file via mail, then it will probably end up saved as the default for the recipient's mail program.  If you copy it via a USB memory stick, then provided the USB memory supports the permissions, it should be ok.  If you use scp over the network, the permissions will be preserved.  If you are sending it to other Macs, you could put your file(s) into a disk image (dmg), in which case all the permissions would be preserved (even if the dmg was mailed) <comment123219> Thanks for your answer but I've found the appify script here at https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/674099 Strange thing is that I had to zip the app to preserve the file permissions.
