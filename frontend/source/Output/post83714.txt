How to globally set WiFi to use device management identity certificate for all users? <body> I'm using Apple's Profile Management service in Mountain Lion, and discovered through serendipity that an enrolled device can authenticate on EAP-TLS to our WPA2-Enterprise Wifi using the Device Managment Identity Certificate instead of an individually-generated-for-user x509 cert. This is extremely convenient, because then we can effectively revoke a device's cert by unenrolling the device.  However, I haven't been able to figure out how to make WiFi always designate EAP-TLS and select the Device Management Identity Certificate globally (whether through /usr/bin/networksetup or through the Profile Manager).   Does anybody have any pointers on how to do this? My goal is to have an OS X = 10.7 machine at a network login prompt capable of logging into the machine, authenticated against the Open Directory server the machine is already bound to. At present a wireless user cannot do this, as the machine's Wifi preferences haven't yet been set to use the aforementioned device management cert.  Thanks!
