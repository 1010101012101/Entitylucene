Installing the Festival Speech Synthesis System with Mavericks <body> I am trying to install Festival onto my Macbook Pro running Mavericks. I tried installing it on my own, but that didn't work.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to find any up-to-date instructions out there on how to do this properly.  There are these dated instructions from 2007, and these slightly less dated instructions from 2011, but neither worked for me.  When I download the 4 different packages I need and then try to use the less dated instruction set, I run into this error (along with some other warnings) with GCC 4.9:  precode../include/EST_String.h:576:16: error: friend declaration specifying a default       argument must be a definition     friend int fcompare(const EST_String &amp;a, const EST_String &amp;b,                 ^ ../include/EST_String.h:579:16: error: friend declaration specifying a default       argument must be a definition     friend int fcompare(const EST_String &amp;a, const char *b,  /code/pre  So I go into the source code and change the declarations where it sets codeconst unsigned char *table=NULL/code within the function call and remove the code=NULL/code.  I then keep compiling and run into this error:  precode../include/EST_TIterator.h:292:7: error: no matching function for call to       'begin' /code/pre  Can someone provide a complete instruction set on how to install Festival onto a more recent version of OS X? I have Homebrew 0.9.5 if it helps.  <answer128922> Why bother using Festival when you have Dictation &amp; Speech System Preferences ? And using Automator you my create a service (&amp; contextual) menu item to "Save the synthesised version"...  However have you installed XQuartz ? http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ Consider using a virtual box or else to get an old operating system running on your latest Mac.  After further investigations :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19221650/error-in-building-speech-tools-for-festival2-1-under-gcc-in-mac-osx-10-8-5  With      gcc --version   Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1   Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)   Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0   Thread model: posix   I have the same error as you while compiling speech_tools.  Error I don't get using GCC 4.7 https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/issues/20  Hope it helps and you'll provide the 10.9 missing manual for Festival.  <answer128979> Here is an email reply I got from Rob Clark (one of the creators of Festival):     Use the speech_tools and Festival packages, then   unpack and run make in each directory.      You will also need dictionary and voice packages from the standard download site.   The festvox and festlex packages should be unpacked in the directory   above festival (i.e. where you unpacked the festival package itself)      Regards. Rob Clark.   Since Rob responded to my email with in hours, feel free to contact him for more information if needed robert@cstr.ed.ac.uk  As mentioned in the comments, unpack the festvox and festlex packages with the command line, and not the Mac's default unpacking software.  <answer164957> Following the release of Edinburgh Speech Tools 2.4 (on 12/25/2014), it's now possible to install that package through Homebrew:  precode$ brew install speech-tools /code/pre  No formula for Festival itself yet, though.  <comment150950> I would downvote this if I had the reputation. My reasons are really my own, but if you must know, I need to access to a portable speech synthesis API. The option you suggest does not offer that. <comment150960> what is happening, when you say it did not work, any error messages ? did you look in the console log? it says it supports 10.6? <comment150961> did you contact robert@cstr.ed.ac.uk <comment150964> @Buscar웃 Upon the using the less dated instructions, I do what they say as the first fix.  I then run into a few compiler problems which I go into the source and fix so it will compile.  Then I run into the compiler problem `error: no matching function for call to 'begin'`.  I'm not sure how I would fix that one.  And no, I have not contacted Robert. <comment150976> OK, please list details in your question so we do not waist time in comments, like Mac Ports version installed (2.2.1) etc.... <comment150992> @Buscar웃 Added all of that information.  Let me know if you would like any more. <comment151044> This is fair enough and indeed a good reason to get a headache  and not using Apple tools. While investigating about your question I was surprised you wanted to use a more than "3 years old" un-updated software... <comment151129> Everything worked very nicely with this solution.  I would like to mention to unpack the festvox and festlex packages with the command line, and not the Mac's default unpacking software.
