How to properly install Java in OS X <body> ul liWhen I look at System Preferences  Java  Update, I see      Your system has the recommended version of Java.br   Java 7 Update 79 /li liFrom Terminal, codejava -version/code:     java version "1.7.0_71"br   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_71-b14)br   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.71-b01, mixed mode) /li liFrom Terminal, codeexport/code:     JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_71.jdk/Contents/Home" /li liIn addition to that, I also have the Java from Apple/Oracle installed as well (when first prompted to install when opening a Java-based app when there's no Java yet installed)/li /ul  strongQuestions:/strong  ol liIs Java 7 Update 79 == jdk1.7.0._71.jdk? Or are these separate?/li liWhen running some thing with Java, there is always the following:      objc[63077]: Class JavaLaunchHelper is implemented in both   /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_71.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java   and   /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_71.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/libinstrument.dylib.   One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined. /li /ol  I'd be more than willing starting from scratch had I understood the steps to do that properly (remove, re-install). If it matters, am running OS X 10.10.  <answer188393> System Preferences shows the Java used for web applets and java -version the one found by /usr/bin/java  To get the latter install the JDK not the JRE  <comment222925> Okay. Downloading "Java SE Development Kit 7u79" for OS X. <comment222926> After installing it, "java -version" still shows _71. I suppose that is because of the JAVA_HOME path? <comment222927> We need to get more accurate on the correct download path Oracle has really messed this yp <comment222928> After updating JAVA_HOME, "java -version" now showing _79, so that's up-to-date now. However the error mentioned in question #2 remains. <comment222929> That should be a separate question - and I think the answer is not use JAVA_HOME - use /usr/libexec/java_home <comment222930> You mean use "/usr/libexec/java_home" as the path value for JAVA_HOME? <comment222932> Looks to be an open bug: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8022291 <comment257164> This is a horrible bug.. it wont go away <comment257172> @IdanAdar this should be two questions as I have answered one and the other question leads to a sparer answer re the bug <comment300234> Possible duplicate of [Why does the version of Java verified by Oracle differ from the version shown at the command line?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70497/why-does-the-version-of-java-verified-by-oracle-differ-from-the-version-shown-at)
