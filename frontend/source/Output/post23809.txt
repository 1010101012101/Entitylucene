Can I upgrade to the Lion Mail app alone, without upgrading to Lion in general? <body> I'm currently on 10.6 and I really like it so I'm not really thinking about an upgrade right now. Two things I really like about 10.7 are the full screen apps and the Mail client.  Is it possible to somehow upgrade/purchase the Mail client of 10.7 alone? It would be really nice if I could do that.  <answer23814> It's not possible, unfortunately, and copying and pasting it won't work either. (FaceTime cannot be copied from 10.7 to 10.6 also.)  <answer23826> These apps (and the full screen mode) require APIs that are not available on versions prior to Lion. Even if one could purchase Mail separately, it wouldn't run.  <answer24985> Consider Postoffice mail app; it's got a lot to offer if you can't upgrade to lion.  <comment162460> Please add an url and information what is thedifference between Mail.app for example to make the answer more complete.
