EarPods pause/play when moving <body> I have encountered a strange behavior twice already, with two separate EarPods headsets. After about a year of using the headset, the cable near the jack gets slightly worn out and it causes really irritating behavior - when bent, it strongpauses/plays/strong song while listening to music. It also hangs up a call just by bending.  Anybody encountered this behavior? Is there something I can do or the only thing is to just throw it away and buy a new one...again?  strongEDIT:/strong   ol liJust to clarify - it is definitely not shake to change feature. I tried it with the phone being stationary and just fiddling with the cable./li liThis question doesn't provide any solution or answer to my question - "what can I do"./li /ol  <answer216965> Misuse is dramatically shortening the life of your cables.    Flexing the cable near the plug will eventually break down the cable shielding, causing electrical shorts, with random results.  ul liFirst, buy a new headset./li liSecond, either learn to treat it gently, or invest in some Sugru which is great for protecting the point where a cable meets the plug./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/smttM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
