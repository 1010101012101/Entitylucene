Billing Information Required for App Updates <body> I'm trying to update 3 apps on my iPad and 3 things happen that never usually happen.  ol liIt asks me to sign in./li liIt asks for my billing information./li liMy card gets denied./li /ol  Now I know my card still works fine so that isn't the problem. The same thing happens when I try to install previously downloaded apps (that cloud button) or install new free apps.  I have no outstanding payments (is it even possible to have outstanding payments with Apple?) so why is this happening?  In case it's needed, I'm using an iPad Air running the latest version. 16GB Harddrive and Wi-Fi only.  I should also make it clear that "None" isn't an option for payment.  <answer144565> Apple App Store accepts only strongInternational Credit Cards./strong I experienced the same issue when I used a debit card on my iTunes account.  Do check that your credit card is authorized by your bank for international usage.  Also check that your credit card platform is either strongVisa/MasterCard/American Express/strong. Diners' Club and Discover may not work everywhere.  <comment170349> My card had always been connected successfully. Just one day it decided not to work. I ended up fixing this problem by temporarily changing to another card then back.
