Key Qâ€“O (QWERTYUIO) isn't working <body> Suddenly, some of the keys (Q to O) isn't working. I don't have any idea what wrong I have done. Only Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, I, O aren't working. All others keys working fine. Anyone have any idea how to fix this problem?  <comment242687> Funny, I had to go to the Apple store today to get a replacement for my keyboard because the p-key didn't work anymore. They exchanged it for free. <comment242717> Try another keyboard and see if that works ok <comment242719> I am using an external keyboard and it's working fine.
