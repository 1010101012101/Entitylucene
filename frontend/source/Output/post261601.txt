Where is the power button on the 2016 MBP With TouchBar? <body> Where is the power button on the 2016 Macbook Pros w/ Touchbar?  <answer261602> From the Apple Support Document, How to turn on or turn off your Mac:     The power button is adjacent to the Touch Bar and integrated with the Touch ID sensor. Press Touch ID (power button) to turn on (or off) your Mac.   <comment330216> I have the new MacBook Pro, and the power button is the same button as the digital fingerprint reader. You just have to press this button.
