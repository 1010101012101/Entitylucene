Change filename in Preview <body> I end up with lots of screen shots that look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K92Im.jpg" alt="screenshot"  Obviously after a while I do not know what they are.  So I open them in Preview to see, and would like now to change the file name to something meaningful.  How do I change screenshot name strongwhile viewing/strong in Preview.   Or is there a way to name the screen shot at the time it was taken (without auto assigning the file name). Basically, take the screenshot- pause + popup asking to name the file before it is saved, while it is still fresh in my memory what it was.  Right now I have to exit Preview while trying to remember the      "§$%&amp;/()?*☂☠   and rename it in Finder.  I can skip the Preview and use Finders Icon or Clover view but that is not the point of my question.  Edit: My Preview must be broken since I do not have the Pull down popup  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OQ8BE.jpg" alt="pull down"  Preview Version 7.0 (826.4)  MBA 10.9.5  <answer181800> I am using Yosemite (10.10) but I believe this feature has existed for a long while...  Simply open the file in preview and click on its name at the top of the preview window.  See screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1jE3.png" alt="Preview rename interface"  <answer181801> Instead of opening the file in Preview, you could  ul liselect the file in Finder/li lipress kbdSpace/kbd to show the picture/li lipress kbdEnter/kbd (even with the screenshot still showing) and rename the file/li /ul  <answer181819> Rather than using Preview you could select the files in Finder and use the codeQuick Look/code icon to check the contents. I only actually use Preview for multi-page files or those with lots of detail. (I actually use similar in my File Manager codeQuollEyeTree/code which is much easier to rename.)  <answer191219> As of June 11 2015 I have not found a solution how to rename a file while in Preview on Mavericks. (10.9.5)  There is also no Save-as function so any changes are saved over the original file.  The codedefaults write com.apple.Preview ApplePersistence -bool no/code does nothing.  My work around is to use the "Export" where I can rename and save the file.  <comment216229> You could also use Cover Flow view in Finder. Then you can see exactly which file you are renaming. <comment216230> Excellent screen shot, but you forgot the "웃" <comment216231> Well my Preview must be broken. I do not have pull down arrow. <comment216232> @Mark, I believe to have specified that in my Question already (see last sentence) <comment216234> It's easier than icon view as you shouldn't have to change the icon's size. It's also why I left a comment and not and answer, it doesn't fit your criteria, but I thought it might be helpful. <comment216235> Might be a 10.10 only feature <comment216246> I just noticed on 10.10.3 that the arrow doesn't appear until you hover the cursor over the filename in the title bar. <comment216258> I am hovering.... and nothing, it might be the Mavericks or my Preview. <comment216260> That's too bad. The only other thing I can think of is right clicking or command clicking on the filename. <comment216274> Thank you, the problem is I got used to use Preview :( was hoping someone can cam up with a script that would ask to enter file name during the screenshot process. <comment216276> question eligible for bounty in 2 days  so lets see.. <comment287232> I had it and used it all the time! But when I reinstalled, [it has disappeared](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/234907/143729). Any idea how to turn it back on? <comment287847> I also lost this pull down menu.
