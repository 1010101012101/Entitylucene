Cannot enlarge Vmware host windows <body> I have Fedora 17 installed on VMWare Fusion 3 on my Macbook Pro 2009. I run Fedora 17 in CLI mode and find I cannot enlarge the window size. The small terminal window size causes text to wrap and hard to read.  But when I try to size the window it doesn't let me.  How to resize host windows in VMWare fusion?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NbCAy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment63276> Isn't this expected behavior? I've never seen a terminal with different dimensions. Consider SSHing into the VMware client and using it as your terminal. There you can resize the window how you like it. <comment63279> Additionally this might be more appropriate on SU <comment63304> @KMC, I'm in agreement with MaxRied about migrating this to [SuperUser](http://superuser.com/).
