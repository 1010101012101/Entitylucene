How can I copy a selection of files from multiple folders into multiple folders? <body> I am developing an Android-app in OS X, and want to use some third-party icons. I have downloaded and extracted the icons into this folder structure:  ul lidrawable-mdpi ul liic_icon1.png/li li.../li /ul/li lidrawable-hdpi ul liic_icon1.png/li li.../li /ul/li lidrawable-xhdpi ul liic_icon1.png/li li.../li /ul/li lidrawable-xxhdpi ul liic_icon1.png/li li.../li /ul/li /ul  I want to copy the files named ic_icon1.png from each directory into my own folder structure with the same folders, ignoring the rest of the icons in the source folders. How can I accomplish this using Finder or Terminal?  <answer172263> You can use codegcp/code from homebrew for this. Install codegcp/code with   precodebrew install coreutils /code/pre  Then You can make something like this:  precodegcp --parents drawable*/ic_icon1.png /path/to/output/dir /code/pre  This will copy all codeic_icon1.png/code preserving directory tree.  From codeman gcp/code:   precode   --parents           use full source file name under DIRECTORY /code/pre
