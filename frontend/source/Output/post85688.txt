How can I update my 3rd generation iPod touch from iOS 5.1.1 iOS 6.0 <body> My itunes keeps on telling me that my iOS 5.1.1 iPod touch is up to date when I click codeCheck for Update/code:  ul liiTunes 11.0.2/li liOS X 10.8.2 /li liiPod 3rd gen (MC008LL)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdh6h.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8pqb.png" alt="enter image description here"  I recall that back in the day I used to get the prompt to update to 6.0.. and then I asked iTunes never to bother me about it again. But now I went to emiTunes-preferences-advanced-reset all dialog warnings./em that still doesn't work..   I also tried updating my software from within the iPod itself: emSettings-General-Software Update/em, but I get the exact same message still.. Ideas?  <answer85690> Unfortunately you can't, iOS 6 requires at least an 4th generation iPod touch (as noted in the System Requirements (right hand side) of Apples Update overview).  <comment98740> oh.. I guess I was confusing the iphone 3gs with ipod touch 3gs.. my bad.. thanks! <comment98752> There is no iPod touch 3gs, Apple calls it the "3rd generation iPod touch"
