screen sharing stops working <body> Periodically my screen sharing stops working.  When I try to connect nothing happens.  telnet 5900 connects but I don't get the normal "RFB 003.889" prompt back. reboot seems to resolve it, but it stops working soon. I tried killing SCreenSharingAgent and it restarts, but still doesn't work. Any advice on how to make it work remotely via ssh?

Do you have physical access to the computer of which you want to access the screen? <comment78202> @patrix sorry, I assumed kernel version maps to OS X version.  It is 10.7.  Yes, I do have physical access.
