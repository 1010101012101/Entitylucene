Why does the diskutil shows I have two local hard drives? <body> I was trying to get my NTFS drive to work today and I discovered that the diskutil thinks I have two local hard drive. This phenomenon is not occurred on my Macbook Pro. Do anyone know why?  Here is what it shows: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I49JR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer295094> If you run codediskutil corestorage list/code, you will get a more detailed list:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 62933502-BEAA-43E6-BDFD-D061365F059D     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         222140432384 B (222.1 GB)     Free Space:   0 B (0 B)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume F96E64AE-1ADD-46C6-A64B-2578D6DFE536     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     222140432384 B (222.1 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 0BAEBD36-8C41-4D0F-A66B-1203DAD5649F         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         AES-XTS         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Conversion Status:       Complete         High Level Queries:      Fully Secure         |                        Passphrase Required         |                        Accepts New Users         |                        Has Visible Users         |                        Has Volume Key         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume B719B24B-31B2-4890-BE9F-5BD924723237             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          221803835392 B (221.8 GB)             Revertible:            No             Revert Status:         Reboot required             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  There’s a Physical Volume (disk0s2) and a Logical Volume (disk1).  This sheet explains the situation quite well: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZ3on.jpg" alt="lvm"  As you can see, you need a Logical Volume; a Physical isn’t enough.  <comment143319> It looks like you have FileVault active on your iMac (note the Apple_CoreStorage entry shown on disk0). disk2 is the NTFS drive. Run `diskutil list` once again without the NTFS drive attached... <comment143321> I tried that too. It shows two drives. The FileVault is not turned on. I also do not have time machine turned on.
