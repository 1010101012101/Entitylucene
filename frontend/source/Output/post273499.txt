AppleScript saving global variable <body> I'd like to access the variables origTrack and origPlaylist from another AppleScript so that I can return to the track and playlist that were playing before the first script executed.  Here's what I have in the first script:  precodeglobal origTrack global origPlaylist  on run arguments     if ((count of arguments) is 0) or (first item of arguments) is not "paused" then          set origTrack to ""         tell application "iTunes"             if player state is playing then                 set origTrack to current track              end if         end tell          set origPlaylist to ""         tell application "iTunes"             if player state is playing or player state is paused then                 set origPlaylist to current playlist                 set newPlaylist to playlist "Morning Mix"                 set view of front window to newPlaylist             end if         end tell         tell application "iTunes" to play newPlaylist      end if     return arguments end run /code/pre  Second script:  precodeon run     set isPlaying to false      tell application "iTunes"         set isPlaying to player state is equal to playing         pause         set current track to origTrack     end tell      if isPlaying then         return "playing"     else         return "paused"     end if end run /code/pre  <answer274160> I usually save text files as the variable they are named after, and recall them in other scripts. I use a folder in /var, i created my own hidden folder so it wouldn't clutter it too much. You can make hidden folders with mkdir in terminal. Example: mkdir /var/.scriptvariables  <comment343846> I'm afraid you'll have to write and read the data from file. Apple Script does not have the ability to access variables from another scripts.
