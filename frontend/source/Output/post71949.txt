how stop google calendars repeating events on additional calendars <body> This annoying behavior is that from time to time the additional calendars on my google account get repeated in the gmail account section and then in the Delegates section. I don't mind where they appear, at my account section or the Delegates,  but the problem is that they appear on both sections and the events get duplicated.  I uncheck the ones on the account section and check the ones on the Delegates and all look all right but then the calendars on the account section disappear and after a while they reappear and duplicate the events again. It's getting very annoying.  <answer71951> After extensive research, it seems google knows about this, and apologizes and is working to fix it.  http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/AWJSWllOt9Y/discussion
