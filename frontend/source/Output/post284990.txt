How to record iPhone 7 Plus camera video feed only to Mac <body> I need to use my iPhone 7 Plus as a recording camera, but instead of recording on the iPhone, I'd like to record directly to my MacBook Air, since it has more memory, and space, for a large recording.  I have a tripod to set up the iPhone, and the Apple Lightning to USB cable, but, is it possible to ONLY record the camera feed?  I know it's possible to record the iPhone screen through Quicktime Player, but this will downsize the video, but I'd like the full resolution video feed to record directly to my Mac.  Is this in any way possible?  strongHardware/strong  ul liiPhone 7 Plus 128Gb/li liMacBook Air 13" Mid 2013/li li4Gb memory/li liIntel HD5000 1536Mb/li /ul
