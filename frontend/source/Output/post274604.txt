Can Find My iPhone password be different than my Apple ID? <body> Can my Find My iPhone password be different than my Apple ID password? I would like it to be different so my girlfriend can see where I am but not be able to access my entire phone.  <answer274634> In short, no.  Your alternative would be to use the Find My Friends app, which should be already installed in anything since iOS 9.  <answer274678> If you’ve removed strongFind My Friends/strong or would rather not use it, an alternative is to share your location via the strongMessages/strong app. Since you and your girlfriend probably text each other, this is a very convenient option, especially if you’re not going to share your location with anyone else.  Open her conversation thread, then tap the ⓘ in the upper-right corner.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/erG8d.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  On the next screen, tap emShare My Location/em. You can choose from several options, including emIndefinitely/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w2Am3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now if she opens her conversation thread with you, she will see your location by tapping that same ⓘ  Note that strongMessages/strong and strongFind My Friends/strong share this information, so she would also be able to see your location in strongFind My Friends/strong (including in the strongToday View/strong widget).
