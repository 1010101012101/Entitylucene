Automounting & fix permissions for home folder on encrypted sparse bundle? <body> For security on a shared machine, I've moved my entire home folder to an encrypted sparse bundle disk image. I then set my User settings home folder to the image.  But along the way, I believe permissions got messed up. Everything works, but I was hoping to "fix permissions." But Disk Utility does not allow me to do so on the image. Any way to do this?  And how can I get the image to auto-mount when I log in to my account? Right now, I need to first mount the image from a different account before I can log in with my account.
