Applescript Crashing on Infinite Loop <body> I am trying to use applescript to wait for a Serial keyword (in Screen - in Terminal), and then pausePlay Spotify when the keyword is seen.  It works fine at first, but then quickly crashes.  Can someone please let me know what I am doing wrong?  Thanks in advance.  I am sorry, but I can't seem to get the Applescript code to format properly here... Here is the Applescript code:  precodetell application "Terminal"     set the bounds of window 1 to {0, 0, 500, 100} end tell  set trigger to 1  set stopString to ""  repeat until (stopString = "stop")      tell application "Terminal"          if the contents of window 1 contains "Start MP3" and trigger is 1 then             tell application "Spotify" to playpause             set trigger to 0         end if          if the contents of window 1 does not contain "Start MP3" then             set trigger to 1         end if          if the contents of window 1 contains "Stop Loop" then             set stopString to "stop"         end if       end tell end repeat /code/pre  <answer249077> Like all while/do (Applescript repeat) loops, you must ensure a condition is met for it to exit.  How do you ensure that a condition will be met and not go on infinitely?  From what I can tell you have a window that can contain "Start MP3" or "Stop Loop."  What if it contains "I love balloons" or is blank?  You haven't created any logic for this (error trapping) so this loop will repeat until the window meets the condition to stop.   To prevent that you to put in a fail safe that sets the condition that stops the loop.  You can do this  by adding a counter and checking the counter against a predetermined value that will force condition that stops the loop to become true.  For example, we set a limit that the loop will run 10 times:  precodeset count to 0  repeat until (stopString = "stop")      ...       if count &gt; 10 then         set stopString to "stop"     end if      set count to count + 1  end repeat /code/pre  <answer249117> I am now having Screen output to log.txt, and the following applescript works just great!  set trigger to 1  set stopString to ""  repeat until (stopString = "stop")  precodeset testTxt to paragraphs of (read POSIX file "/Users/fed/log.txt") set countTxt to (count of testTxt) - 1 set lastLine to item countTxt of testTxt     if lastLine contains "Start MP3" and trigger is 1 then     tell application "Spotify" to playpause     set trigger to 0 end if  if lastLine does not contain "Start MP3" then     set trigger to 1 end if  if lastLine contains "Stop Loop" then     set stopString to "stop" end if /code/pre  end repeat  <comment308830> But I't like the loop to go on for a long time, waiting for one of the 2 input "Start MP3" or "Stop Loop." Sometimes the wait may be 10 or more minutes.  Can that be done? <comment308835> You can do anything, you just have to define the parameters ***specifically*** as to what you want to happen.  You also have to define what you want to have happen if those conditions are never met; this is why you have an infinite loop - the stop condition is never met. <comment308838> Sorry, but I don't understand.  I thought I did make a stop condition by including the stopString.  Also, how can I make the stop condition 30 minutes?  Thanks for your help so far. <comment308879> What do you mean by crashing, exactly?  Is anything interesting in the console log when it crashes? What you have looks reasonable to me. I tested it on my system and it worked okay. I didn't see any crashes. I would recommend a "delay 1" before the final end repeat, to cut down on the CPU usage. Right now, it hogs the CPU.  Caveat: I don't have Spotify, so I changed that to iTunes.
