How to enable Subscribed Calendar to be in read/write mode? <body> As today, any Subscribed Calendar is added as strongRead Only/strong to the iCal Application  to confirm that. just double click in a day with the subscribed calendar selected and you will get this annoying popup message  img src="https://cl.ly/2td6/Screen_shot_2010-10-20_at_12.30.10_AM.png" alt="alt text"  strongWhat should I do to enable read/write mode/strong into the subscribed calendar, as it supports both ways (I created the URL and works great with Thunderbird w/Lightning)  strongProblem also comes/strong that in iPad/iX happens the same situation, and strongall I wanted was to be able to create and edit events/strong to by calendar  <answer9779> LOL you're using iCal wrong. Deselect the cal you subscribed to put any personal notations you have in your own calendar that you do have r/w access to. Just because you subscribe doesn't mean you can "edit". If you "create" your own cal you can change it anyway you'd like.  <comment3004> Is this a CalDAV calendar? Or just an .ics file on a server somewhere? (WebDAV?) <comment3008> the file in CalDAV is an iCal format, so .ics. Right now it's a web server that reads Http Methods such as `PROPFIND` and `PUT` and delivers an iCal file. <comment10241> you're quite arrogant aren't you? iCal WebDav is enabled for Read and Write, but iCal App does not do it, if you use Mozilla Thunderbird with Lightning, you will see you are able to edit **ANY** Subscribed URL !!!
