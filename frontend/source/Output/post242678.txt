Xcode error The maximum number of apps for free development profiles has been reached <body> I am under the age of 18 so I can't get into the Apple Developer program. I am forced to just use my free developer account and I have been for the past year. Today for some reason I am getting this error:  codeThe maximum number of apps for free development profiles has been reached./code  I've had a similar error to this before when I was creating new apps left and right and it said I had too much profiles for the week, so I waited and continued development. This error on the other hand isn't giving me any actions to fix the issue and I can't solve on myself.  Is there a way to possible delate some of the developer profiles that I have registered? Do I just need to wait a couple of days? I don't know what to do because the error message has no recommended action. Thanks!  <answer242804> So I went back to Xcode 7 and created a new app and tried to install it on my device and I found that it gave me the error that I can only make 10 apps per week. Xcode 8 must just not be able to give you that error message yet. Basically, I just need to wait for the week to be over.  <answer252638> In my case this guide worked; that is, in Xcode go to codeWindow â†’ Devices/code then under codeInstalled Apps/code delete some of your apps and afterwards I could run my own apps on the device again.  I also rebooted the phone beforehand, but I assume that was not necessary.  <comment298671> Have you tried setting your Mac date back a few days?  I don't know but it might trick Xcode and let you continue working.  Otherwise, I don't think you can get around this for the free account.  If you want to continue developing, without restrictions, you'll have to pay the $99. <comment314355> please put this as a comment, and not an answer. <comment323077> Worked for me!!(Y) No need to reboot
