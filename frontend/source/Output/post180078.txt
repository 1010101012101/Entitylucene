Yosemite Finder Window: See Item count/selection and available size <body> I’ve just upgraded to Yosemite (10.10.2) and would love to know if anyone can help me figure out how to make my finder window display a line at the bottom letting me know how many files i have in each given folder as well as remaining space left in my mac (like i used to have with version 10.9.5).  I know about the command+shift+i, but was wondering if there was this more fixed way of having that info always hanging out on my finder window!   Thanks in advance for your help,  <answer180079> To show this information in Yosemite, do the following:  ol liOpen a Finder window/li liGo to the strongView/strong menu - Show Status Bar/li liInformation should now appear at the bottom of the window./li /ol  Alternatively, kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd / /kbd will toggle it on/off.  <comment213752> It also works same way on Mavericks :)
