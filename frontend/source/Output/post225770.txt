My ethernet is missing, how can i find it? <body> COmcast was setting up an ethernet cable and there was no option to choose ethernet.  I have for years been using the stick from clear but wanted to go to cable for faster.  I currently am using a Wi-Fi router because that's all that I can get to work.  But where is the ethernet?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/erF7r.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer225772> Click the + button on the bottom left, and select Ethernet from the menu to add it.
