It's been abandoned, unfortunately, but it works on Lion with a few bugs and the developer has let everyone use the Pro version for free. It has tons of flexibility, and lets you preview, reply, compose, and file messages, all from a little unobtrusive icon. It supports Growl, and uses very tiny amounts of CPU and RAM.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QU9wR.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X9DMp.png" alt="example of message preview"  <comment37330> Agreed, one of the best software purchases I've made <comment37348> Or you could get rid of that stuff on the desktop to speed up login :-) <comment37350> Very true! No matter how many times i clean it up, there's always junk on there! <comment37374> +1 Awesome! I've always wanted TextExpander. <comment39504> Sorry for the following advertisement, but I was hesitant to buy the family pack for my Macs but today there's a promo [iStat Menus Family Pack (5 Users) 3.19](http://www.mupromo.com/?ref=7193) for 12$ instead of 24$; so I grabbed it - don't know if it's only valid for version 3.19 - actually this would make me quite angry ! <comment46330> Their free Dashboard app is good, too. <comment52704> I absolutely adore Notify.  I was heartbroken when the dev announced abandonment of the project.  I know it's a huge task, but I've gotten permission from the developer to create a Notify 2 of sorts.  I'll tell you one thing: it's going to take a while. <comment52724> @sudorm-rf Good luck! Be sure to let everyone know when it comes out.
