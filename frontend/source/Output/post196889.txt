iPhone 5c Digitizer or logic board damage <body> My wife dropped her phone on Sunday... I don't want to replace the screen if it's the logic board and nothing can be done to recover her data. A beautiful picture:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SHmCO.png" alt="Plaid Phone"  If this were the 1970's her phone would be emso/em vogue... Who didn't love plaid back then?  Anyway... I have taken the screen off and checked the connections, put everything back together. No change.  ul liThe phone still rings when called/li liThe phone vibrates when switched into silent mode/li liThe digitizer is not working - the phone cannot be "unlocked" and calls cannot be answered/li liThere was a screw that had detached from the retaining plate where the screen connects to the logic board  ul liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DfhO2.png" alt="Loose Screw"/li /ul/li liI tried hard reboots (power + home)  ul liThe home and power buttons are still recognized but this has no impact on the artifacting display/li liDuring the hard reboot the display goes blank and then lights up again after being restarted./li /ul/li liI tried disconnecting / reconnecting the battery from the logic board  ul liThis had no impact on the display. We've gone plaid./li /ul/li /ul  Curious if anyone can tell whether this symptom is indicative of a bad logic board or if the display / digitizer cables have been damaged!  <answer196916> If your phone rings when called, that tells you a couple things that the phone is able to do:  ul liThe phone is able to turn on./li liThe phone is able to process the received call (and I'm guessing all of iOS's pretty effects with loading it as well)./li liThe phone is able to process events from all of the phone's physical buttons (the Lock button, Volume Up/Down, and the Home button)./li /ul  However, as it seems, the phone strongisn't/strong able to send touch events to the UI, meaning the digitizer is broken.  Screw in the loose screw, replace the screen/digitizer unit, and reboot. All will be well. :)  <comment235323> Excellent! Thank you for your take on it!
