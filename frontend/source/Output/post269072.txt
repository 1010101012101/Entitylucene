Is it possible to copy the whole system (including system and files) onto another hard drive <body> Say I want to change the hard drive for my iMac Mini, can I somehow copy the entire operating system including the files (so Sierra and all files, all softwares, and etc) onto the new hard drive. If so, how?  <comment338002> I prefer to install the OS on the new drive and then let it migrate apps and accounts using the assistance that runs. If you really want a clone - see the linked question.
