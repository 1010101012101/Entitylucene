Change html files to txt on entire folder <body> Is there a mac terminal command to change all .html files to .txt including the files in sub folders too?  <answer210362> I guess actually you just want to rename them. Run the following from inside the folder. If you do not trust the command, add codeecho/code before codemv/code to see what it would do.  precodefind . -type f -name "*.html" -exec bash -c "mv {} \`dirname {}\`/\`basename -s.html {}\`.txt" \; /code/pre  This does the following:  ol liLooks up every file (code-type f/code) in the current folder (code./code) whose name is ends with ".html" (code-name "*.html"/code)/li liIt than finds out the path of the file (codedirname/code), adds a slash (code//code) and the name of the original file without the ".html" suffix (codebasename -s.html/code) and adds a ".txt" suffix./li liThen it renames the original file (codemv/code)./li /ol  blockquote class="spoiler"    Actually, the ` ` notation for using a programs output as part of a command is deprecated. code$()/code should be used instead, but in the case of codefind/code the backticks are easier to use.    <answer210403> h1for-loop/h1  precodefor file in *.html; do    mv "${file}" "${file%.html}".txt done /code/pre  This 'for loop' is just one way to do it.  <answer210404> h1rename/h1  You can use coderename/code which you can install using brew.  Install coderename/code using brew: codebrew install rename/code  Rename files using coderename/code:  precoderename -s .html .txt * /code/pre  <comment253848> see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64497/how-to-rename-multiple-files-at-once <comment253850> I got it but how do we do this to an entire folder! Not logical to enter 1000's of file names. <comment253852> you cd to the folder first. tbh, you could have done it by now, using something like [Quick File Renamer Lite](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/quick-file-renamer-lite/id420116929?mt=12) or a dozen freeware alternatives <comment253853> This doesn't change the extension. To do what this software does you don't need anything and Mac itself can do it. You can select all files and then right click and rename all files. <comment253854> I'd forgotten that's now included in Yosemite. I've had it for years as a 3rd party add-in service. So why not use that? Does it *have* to be done in terminal? Otherwise it's just Replace Text  .html  .txt  Finder prefs  advanced if you want to switch off the change extension warning. <comment253857> Do you just want to change the extension or do you want to remove all HTML formatting as well?
