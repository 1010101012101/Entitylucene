How to regain features from Safari 5 that are not found in Safari 6? <body> I upgraded to Mountain Lion, there are a stronglot/strong of differences in Safari 6.   Have the four features below been relocated?   If not relocated, are there fixes?  ul liActivity window (previously: Window - Activity) is gone./li liBonjour access from the bookmarks menu is gone./li liAbility to empty cache (previously: Safari - Empty Cache) is gone./li likbddelete/kbd/kbdbackspace/kbd key no longer works for going to the previous page./li /ul  <answer58844>    Bonjour access from the bookmarks menu is gone.   Well I found out that in Mountain Lion, Bonjour is available from Safari  Bookmarks  Bonjour  Device.  I still haven't figured out the other problems.  <answer58861> The action for emptying caches was moved to the develop menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YOZr1.png" alt=""  You can still see resources in the web inspector:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M7tyB.png" alt=""  To download YouTube videos, reload the page after opening the web inspector and double-click the codevideoplayback/code resource. To download it, you have to focus the location bar and press ⌥↩. ⌘S only saves some metadata.  <answer58867> The kbddelete/kbd/kbdbackspace/kbd key navigation has been removed.  To restore it:  ol liQuit Safari./li liOpen Terminal and enter this code at the command line:  defaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2BackspaceKeyNavigationEnabled -bool YES/li liRestart Safari./li /ol  <answer59703> Actually, Bonjour is still there, but you have to include it yourself. Just go to Preferences  Bookmarks, and enable what you'd like there.  <answer60230> h1Bring any tab to foreground/h1  I used the strongActivity window of Safari 5.x/strong to switch between tabs. Effective for all tabs of all windows, including windows that were minimised before quit. Very strongquick and simple/strong:   ul lidouble-click.  /li /ul  h2Without the Activity window/h2  h3Sessions 1.3.0.2/h3  The popover works as expected – click and hold the toolbar item to reveal a menu.   The manager, which appears in a separate tab, fails to list reopened windows that were minimised before quit. I reported this bug to the developer, with reference to this post.   <comment67807> I don't see a Bonjour entry in the Bookmarks menu?! <comment67891> It looks like the page resources isn't as comprehensive as it used to be.  I'm seeing only a subset of what I used to see in the Activity window.  Embedded videos, for example.  I used to be able to open the Activity window and option-click (or control-click, I don't quite remember) to download the actual file.  But now I'm not seeing them at all. <comment67895> @David It could depend on the way the videos are served. I can't see the files for videos on YouTube, but ones on other sites are shown in both the resource and network request views. <comment67909> Ah, it does appear in the network request view.  However, I'm not sure how to save from that view.  Is there some key-click combination?  I've clicked the little arrow and it looks like it's loading the video (could be a while in this case), will it be savable after that? <comment68083> Never mind, I'm able to copy the URL from elsewhere in that display (on the right where the requested resource's details are displayed), paste it into a new tab, and option-return to initiate a download. <comment68747> Also missing is the RSS reader. That's one reason I'm not updating to Safari 6 for now. <comment69355> [How to mimic Safari 5 Activity window with Mountain Lion, to save FLV video files?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/59449/8546) <comment132761> In Safari 5, I use the Activity window to see all my tabs of all my windows. Is there a way to do that in Safari 7 ? <comment132762> @NicolasBarbulesco - Can you take a screenshot of you doing that so I can get a better idea of what you mean? <comment132784> @qegal — [Here is a screen photo — not taken by me.](https://ahmetalpbalkan.com/blog/static/images/2012/07/5activity-window.png) There are all the tabs of all the windows. So I can type the first letters of the title, and the line gets selected. I remember that I can also search with Apple F. When I have the line selected, I press Return, and shazam ! Safari gives me the wanted window, with the wanted tab selected.
