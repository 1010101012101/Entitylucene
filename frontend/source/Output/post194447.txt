Windows on Macbook: Prevent home and end keys from jumping to next line if fn key is released first <body> I've been using my Macbook as my "everything machine" with Bootcamp and Windows 8.1 and I love it except for one thing. As a programmer, I do a lot of typing, and I use the codefn + left/code / codefn + right/code key combinations to simulate codeHome/code and codeEnd/code on Windows and jump to the beginning and end of lines. However, sometimes the caret jumps to the end of the line and then goes one character further, to the next line.  This may sound like a small thing, but it becomes unbelievably frustrating the more it happens because every time you use the combination, you have to double-check that your caret hasn't gone off to the next line unexpectedly.  I've determined exactly what causes this. If I release the codefn/code key a fraction of a second before releasing the arrow key, the caret moves the additional character. I've tried to retrain myself not to do this, but when typing quickly, it's almost impossible to guarantee that you will always hold the codefn/code key down until releasing the arrow key. When typing naturally, I tend to release both at the same moment, and sometimes the codefn/code key just comes up first.   Please tell me there is some way to fix this. Thank you in advance!  <comment231943> Maybe increase the key repeat rate or delayâ€¦ System Prefs/Keyboard/Keyboard <comment231968> @Tetsujin Thanks for the reply. This is for Windows running on a Macbook. I liked the basic idea, so I tried changing the Keyboard preferences in Windows, but unfortunately that had no effect on this problem.
