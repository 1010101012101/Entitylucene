How to disable Location Services using Siri? <body> Which sentence should I say to disable Location Services using Siri? Saying "disable location services" she says she is unable to do that!  <answer269349> Siri is currently unable to enable/disable Location Services. You'll have to use Settings.  <answer288032> say 'hide my location' and 'don't hide from my friends'  <comment338422> You can say "Open Location Services" though, which will take you right to the slider in the appropriate settings screen to manually turn it off. Closest thing to a solution that can be done right now given Siri's limitations.
