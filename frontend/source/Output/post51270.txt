Using timed access control in airport express <body> Have read Using timed access control in airport extreme base station but the fix described has not worked.  Clicking "+" reverts the times back to the default "09:00  to  17:00"?  Any suggestions?  <answer51279> You have to press kbdEnter/kbd after changing the time fields (so the cursors jumps to the next one). It's kind of user-unfriendly, bites me a lot of times as well.
