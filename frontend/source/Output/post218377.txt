How do I backup Messages from Macbook? <body> I want to delete all of my messages off my Macbook and iPhone but I'd like to back them up before I do so.  How do I go about doing this?  <comment263998> They're stored in `~/Library/Messages`, but I think it's much easier to just decide if you want to actually delete them, instead of making a backup and trying to restore. <comment264000> I have all of my text messages from 2011 on my phone and a bunch on my Macbook. I want to delete them. It just takes up too much space. Literally thousands upon thousands of messages. <comment264007> I'm pretty sure it's not that simple. The messages & database are 2 separate entities, & recombining later is not guaranteed. (On phone, can find links later) <comment264042> See this for backup options - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6900/how-can-i-export-sms-text-messages-from-my-iphone note that none of them mention being able to later restore them...
