'Add notes' to a Calendar event using Automator <body> I would like to build a 'Service' for selected text which:  ol liGet the currently selected text/li liCreates an Calendar event/li liadds the selected text as a 'note' for that Calendar event/li /ol  I prefer Automator for creating such workflows. In automator I can use building blocks like:  ul licodeGet Value of Variable/code/li licodeNew Calendar Event/code/li /ul  But I have no option to add the selected text as a note to my event.  Is there a way to add notes to an Calendar event using Automator? Or perhaps using the codeRun Applescript/code or codeRun Shell Script/code building blocks to achieve this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hGGHtm.png" alt="Notes in Calendar"
