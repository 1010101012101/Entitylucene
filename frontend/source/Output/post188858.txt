How to fix non-bootable OS X, after Boot Camp problems? <body> I accidentally removed the "Recovery HD" partition, when I was installing Windows, and now my OS X system is not booting anymore.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5gtxK.jpg" alt=""  How do I fix this, without wiping the entire disk, and starting from scratch?  I started out with Boot Camp, and when I was partitioning the disk during the installation of Windows, I didn't knew which partition I needed to choose, so I booted back into OS X. When I got back in the installer of Windows (with a different resolution), I wasn't able to reformat the partitions, as was instructed in the Boot Camp manual, so removed the last two partitions (I though Boot Camp created two partitions for Windows; one for booting, one for the OS). But still, I was unable to install Windows. When I rebooted the system, OSX was not booting anymore. Trying to get into the OS X recovery mode, it revealed that the recovery partition was gone, because it started Internet Recovery.  It seems that the recovery partition is required for OS X to boot. Is that the case? And if so, how can I get it back, without doing a reinstall (or something like Missing Yosemite Recovery Partition). If not, how can I get the system booting again?  strongSpecs (maybe useful)/strong  ul liMacBook Pro 15" (late 2013)/li liFileVault enabled/li /ul  <answer189333> Eventually, I fixed it by following a guide I found online (cannot find it anymore). I took a live cd with [TestDiskcode](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk), and ran that. It found the deleted partition, and I recreated it with/codegdisk`. That worked like a charm ;)  <comment223637> The Recovery partition is needed to decrypt the OS X partition when FileVault 2 is enabled. Do you have a backup? You may not have to do a full restore if you do. <comment223638> did you try the cmd+r (Internet recovery) <comment223641> The only issue is that Internet Recovery is often woefully out of date, especially if your computer is a few years old. That's why I'm asking if he has a backup. These days, the backup drive comes with an up to date recovery mode, which does the same thing, but shouldn't be out of date. <comment223767> @Froggard No, I don't.I managed to get all my files out, using the internet recovery (@Buscarì›ƒSD so yes, I already tried that). But it should be possible to fix this somehow by recovering the partition. <comment224332> How about using a recovery partition from an other mac or usb stick ? The target mode might also come handy if you intend to play with hdiutil or dd...
