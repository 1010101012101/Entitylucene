Screen Sharing over internet on OS X Lion - cannot control remote machine <body> I'm trying to connect remotely to a family member's new MacBook Air from my own iMac. Both machines are running OS X Lion.  I can connect to the files on the remote machine and I can see the screen of the remote machine.  But I cannot interact (mouse or keyboard) with the remote machine.   I can run LogMeIn (free version) with no issues. But I'd like to log in to the machine remotely with no input from the family member - it shaves at least 30 minutes off the support call. ;-)  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?  <answer53213> Most likely you have Observe Mode enabled on your end. In Screen Sharing.app, go to the View menu. You should see an entry for "Switch to Control Mode".  <answer53262> I have a Mac Pro and a Mac mini both with Lion installed. What I did for screen sharing is that I set up a administer account with a password on both machines. When using screen sharing, I log in using the administrator password instead of using the code in the sharing setting.  Note that in the sharing setting, only the administers are allowed to modify/control the screen without a VNC pass code.    <answer174520> I had the same issue and carried out the following steps.  ol liOn the computer that you are sharing(viewing) access "Sharing Preferences" (System Preferences - Sharing)Tick the Checkbox titled "Remote Management"/li liClick on the Text "Remote Management"/li liI recommend that you Only allow access for specific users. ( I use the same account on both machines). If you do this make sure you add the user to the list/li liOn the right hand side within the "Allow access for" section - Click on the Options button/li liGrant the user/s access to the functions you wish to carry out./li /ol  Lastly, restart the screen star from on the Computer that you are viewing the Shared Screen from.    This should do the trick.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NkcRC.png" alt="enter image description here"   <comment60865> Thanks for that. Sorry, should've said - Can't switch to control mode either. So I guess the question is: why can't I access control mode? <comment60975> Can you confirm that the remote machine is set to allow control connections?  Alternatively, if you have SSH access into the remote, you can use the "kickstart" command, something like: sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -configure -users adminuser -access -on -privs -all -clientopts -setmenuextra -menuextra yes -restart -agent -menu -console <comment61017> Yes, I think so: in the Systems Preferences, Sharing panel, "Remote Management" is on, and I allow access for "All Users"   Is that enough? I'll try the kickstart command tonite. <comment61018> My screen sharing works well in my local network. problem is I'm connecting via internet (and two continents ...) to the remote machine
