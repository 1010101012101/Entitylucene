Opt out from getting public beta versions of OS X <body> Until now, I used to be a public beta tester on OS X, so I opted in for beta versions and the current OS X version is 10.11.1 Beta (15B38b) (as for now, it's the latest public beta version).  Since I do not want to receive any updates regarding public beta versions through App Store, I opted out through the settings of the Mac. So, I want to ask whether I have to perform a fresh install of the final release of El Capitan or I am going to get any new update (regarding the final release) through Mac App Store when it is released?  <answer211771> I was on the public beta also! I was able to go to the public release just by updating from the App Store. It kept all my information!   <comment255658> So, you reverted from some El Capitan public beta version to the official release (which you downloaded through the Mac App Store) and  all your files were just in their place? <comment255665> Correct. The only feature that was removed was the feedback app! It was only needed for the beta though.
