Adding contacts to a group is creating duplicate cards <body> When dragging contacts to a newly formed group in OS X,  a duplicate card is automatically created and the contact in not added to the group. Repeated attempts to drag the contact name to the group name continues to duplicate complete cards of that contact. Only about 1 in 5 attempts are working correctly. I am having to delete a duplicate card for each attempt to add that name to the group.
