MacBook Air unable to receive updates <body> MacBook Air stopped receiving update alerts about 2 weeks ago. If I go to strongSoftware Updates/strong on the Apple menu, it just opens a blank page. If I go through iTunes, I get a dozen messages about iTunes being unable to recognize the certificate.   OS X 10.9.5 (13F1077)  <comment227091> Have you verified that the date and time on your computer are correct? Sometimes this can cause issues w/ the certificates
