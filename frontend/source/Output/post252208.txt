iOS: block ads in Apps without Jailbreak and VPN tunnel (normal 3G/4G network) <body> For example in RT app there are annoying ads. There is no way to pay subscription without ads.  Howto block ads in Apps (in Mobile Safari I block them all)? I found only apps that offer a VPN tunnel (you need 100% to trust them) and solutions for iPhones with Jailbreak. Are there other possibilities?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1bJVO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer252282> No, because apps aren't able to inject themselves into other apps without jailbreaking, they are only able to use Safari Content Blockers in Safari or routing network traffic through a VPN.
