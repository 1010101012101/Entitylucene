What is the source of the Earth and Moon wallpaper? <body> What is the original source of this wallpaper, introduced in Mountain Lion? I'm guessing was taken on a Gemini or Apollo spaceflight, but I can't find it in any of NASA's albums, and the image has been re-uploaded so many times that Google Image Search isn't bearing any fruit either.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KhP8S.jpg" alt="Earth and Moon wallpaper"  Photo from here.  <answer129516> It is clearly a Photoshop creation, as the shadows do not concur to the actual position of the celestial objects.  <comment151513> The scale of the moon and the position of the earth's shadow give me the feeling that this might be photoshopped together, but i'm not sure.
