Why does my iPhone power off when the battery is down to 30%? <body> Today I was walking using my iPhone 6S running iOS 9.3 as a pedometer and it shutdown.   When I got home and plugged it in, it said 30% capacity.   That seems strange. I would expect it for 2% or 5% to preserve RAM, but 30%? Maybe there is a setting I don't know about.   My question is: strongWhy does my iPhone power off when the battery is down to 30%?/strong   <answer239881> This is usually for one of two reasons:  ol liDefective battery. Your 6S is less than a year old, so contact Apple's support for your country for a replacement. Usually if this is the case, it will always happen at the same percentage because of one or more defective cells in the battery./li liBad calibration. I've never seen that be 30% off, though. After the battery is drained completely, charge the phone back to 100% completely (and for good measure, leave it on the charger for another hour or two)./li /ol  <answer253350> I had a wonderful fix to the same problem and that was getting the phone rested to the original settings, via DFU. It's a bit painful but if you back up your phone first, get it into DFU mode and re-install your phone - it works like charm !

Try reboot or reset; if no better, get the battery checked out. <comment294575> A phone powering off at 30% is a big sign of a failing battery. Check your battery at the nearest Apple Service Provider. <comment294618> I've seen that happen with the phone getting too cold or too hot.  I had it shut down on a bicycle ride up Vail pass the other day.  The phone effectively froze on me.  Similarly when I left it, in its black leather case in the sun. <comment315274> Welcome to Ask Different. Please copy and paste the relevant info from the link into your answer to prevent [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot). <comment324936> I've had the same issue. Generally 10% give or take, but today it just happened at 30%. I've seen this advice before and it doesn't seem to help me. Maybe it's because my "100%" charges actually get stuck at 97%?
