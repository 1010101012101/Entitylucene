Music player program that reads star ratings from Windows <body> I used Winamp on Windows. This allowed me to rate songs using a 5 star system. These star ratings are stored in the files as metadata. I could view the star rating in file properties in Winamp and Windows Explorer.  Now I have switched to Mac. I want a music player that reads and writes the same star rating in the file metadata. Is there one?  <comment150185> is winamp for mac not working for you? <comment150186> It works but seems to have very few features compared to Windows version. It doesn't seem to show star ratings at all
