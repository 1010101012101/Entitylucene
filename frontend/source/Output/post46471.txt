How can I use Lion's "look up" feature without the trackpad? <body> Lion introduced the new "Double-tap with three fingers" to strongLook up/strong, which pops up a small definition of whatever word you double-tap. Is there any way to invoke look up without the trackpad? For example, if I'm on a desktop Mac (with a normal mouse) is there any way to quickly look up a word by using this same look up feature?  <answer46473> From this:     For years, Mac OS X has had a great shortcut for getting a quick definition of a word: Simply hover the cursor over the word, and press the keyboard shortcut Command-Control-D to bring up a little Dictionary popup. This still works in Lion, but it’s now much more fully featured and also has a great new way to access it.   Your looking for kbdCmd/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdD/kbd  subPS: Thanks for asking, it actually made me look and learn something new/sub  <answer46543> Have you tried right clicking…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N1A3P.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment53117> @jaberg: The only problem I have with that title is that I specifically want to use the "Look up" feature of Lion, rather than the "Look Up in Dictionary" service which was available in many versions of OS X. <comment53118> You're always free to roll back an edit.  FWIW, the keyboard shortcut worked pre-Lion and this feature is a new look applied to an old friend.  Cheers! <comment53119> @jaberg: I still see the old feature available in Lion though, which is what could make it confusing. I agree that the original title looked awkward, I just can't think of a good way to phrase it. <comment53130> +1 answer. Learned something great! <comment53226> +1. Does not work in all apps, though (e.g. not in Firefox). <comment53252> It works in all Apps that use the system text APIs. Firefox apparently doesn't.
