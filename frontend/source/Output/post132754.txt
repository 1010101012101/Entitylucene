Trouble sending mms <body> I can text my son from my iphone5 but cannot send pics. He has android without internet can send fine to others. I am able to send him pics from my husband's iphone4 with upgrade toIOS7.1.   <comment157198> Which service providers are you on - some don't support photo messing <comment157210> Also make sure you have turned Cellular Data on. <comment157266> you probably need the update too
