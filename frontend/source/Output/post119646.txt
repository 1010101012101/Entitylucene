Score Corrections in Garageband. Notes on '& 2 &' are showing up as triplets <body> I am trying to arrange Canon in D. I have some music on "Eighth Rest http://cf.ltkcdn.net/music/images/std/171312-30x30-8th-rest.jpg &amp; 2 &amp; Eighth Rest http://cf.ltkcdn.net/music/images/std/171312-30x30-8th-rest.jpg &amp; 4 &amp;". The GarageBand auto score is displaying it as triplets. I am trying to get it as close as possible so that way I can have a fluent score.  Video: here
