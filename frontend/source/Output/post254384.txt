change sandbox config for ntpd <body> My environment: OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.5 -  For testing I tried to modify the configuration file for ntpd. For example adding a leap-file or writing statistics. As my system is running "rootless" ( SIP ) ntpd couldn't read this additional files as they were not configured in the sandbox config for ntpd.   The workaround: I booted OS X from an inserted USB stick. The original SSD was already mounted. So I could easily modify /usr/share/sandbox/ntpd.sb with vi. After a reboot ntpd worked as expected.   My question: Is there an easier way to modify the sandbox configuration without booting twice ?
