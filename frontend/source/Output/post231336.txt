How can I globally disable 'Text Replacement'? <body> I've been looking for an answer to this question for a while, so I'm guessing this can only be solved with a console command.  What I want to do is disable 'Text Replacement' everywhere on my Mac. The trick is, I have a library of text replacements that I use on my iPhone (like codeill &gt; I'll/code), and apparently it's synced to my iCloud account. As a result, if I make changes in one place it affects all of my devices everywhere - making the easy solution of "delete all of the text substitutions from your substitution library" is unavailable.  The text replacement I'm referring to specifically is the option you can disable by right-clicking on any text input area, then selecting 'Substitutions &lt; Text Replacement' (see image).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYo0A.png" alt="Disabled &#39;Text Replacement&#39;"  I know you can disable this one field at a time by right-clicking fields and unchecking 'Text Replacement', but it is enabled by default for every individual input on every field for every application (including the entire internet and my browser's search/address bar), and it periodically gets re-enabled on some inputs.  I've already disabled 'Correct Spelling Automatically' from my system text options. (see image)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cIWSz.png" alt="Disabled &#39;Correct Spelling Automatically&#39;"  And still I have to disable 'Text Replacement' on every field or it will try to correct my typing with entries in that dictionary.  I use iCloud tabs, handoff, and a number of Apple's other "Better Together" features (and I don't want to lose the ability to track my devices with 'Find my [device]'), so I don't want to disassociate my iCloud account from my computer or devices, but I'd be really happy if I never had to disable 'Text Replacement' on an input field again.  Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated!  strongEDIT:/strong I've found https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/217387/172938 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/121553/172938 , both of which have some console references:  codedefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true/code from the first link (for enabling 'Text Replacement' in Safari).  codedefaults delete -g NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems/code from the second link (for deleting the User Dictionary emas seen in my second image/em).  Both pertain to my issue tangentially, but each to the opposite effect I'm looking for.  <comment370039> If you disable iCloud Drive, they'll stop syncing between devices. Not sure if there's a more granular setting within iCloud Drive (e.g. just unchecking System Preferences) that will prevent the syncing.
