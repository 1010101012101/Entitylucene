iPhone mail fecthing time < 15 minutes <body> Is it possible to set iPhone mail fecthing time &lt; 15 minutes under iOS 5?  The current configuration only allows 15 minutes data pushing, but I need to react to my mail fast. Is there a way to get around this or an application that could help this?  <answer67010> Set Push to ON (under settings-Mail, Contacts, Calendar-Fetch New Data). You can even select push or pull for each single mail account under Advanced.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BeJda.png" width="300" /  <comment78938> Yeah. Push it. [/nerd] <comment78948> What kind of address is it? Gmail, Yahoo Mail, something else? <comment79040> Who is your cell carrier and do they get that cool icon from Apple or do you need to modify the system to show the red colors there? <comment79058> That's Vodafone's logo, though I don't know about the rest of your question. :) <comment79059> This is a good tip, but it's dependent on your mail provider supporting push. Great if you use Exchange or Yahoo, but it's not supported for IMAP accounts (like Gmail). <comment79122> Sorry, what I mean is 15 mins data pushing, question edited :) <comment79124> Yes I knew this setting, as you can see the minimum is Every 15 minutes, I would like to set it smaller than that..if not possible, I would wish to have an apps if there is available..I am using gmail. (Sorry for the typo "pull" in the question, I have edited it..what I mean is "push") <comment79125> If you set us Gmail as an exchange account, it can do push. <comment79126> Who is your email provider? <comment79127> Hi, it's gmail. <comment79133> What do you mean exchange account? And can it push say every 2 minutes? <comment339888> No longer possible with gmail exchange accounts https://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/gmail-push-notification-no-longer-works-with-mail-on-new-ios-dev/
