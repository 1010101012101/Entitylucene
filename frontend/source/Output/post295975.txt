All SD Cards mount as Internal <body> I don't know why but recently all SD cards mount as Internal on my Mac  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vnUSK.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I solve this problem?  PS. Only SD cards mount as Internal all pen drives mount as external.  <answer295986> What you are seeing is expected behavior and how all Macs with built-in SD card readers are treated by the OS.  If you want to split hairs it is indeed "internal" as the card itself is inserted stronginto/strong the Mac, even though a bit of it still stacks out.   Regardless of that it is still expected behavior and not a problem. As to why? well only Apple hardware and software engineers can give you a definitive answer on that and they aren't allowed to say
