How to bind ⌘← and ⌘→ to previous and next tab in Safari 10? <body> I'm used to having Command-Left Arrow (kbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd) and Command-Right Arrow (kbd⌘/kbd+kbd→/kbd) to switch between tabs, going to the previous and next tabs. I have configured these keys in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts for Safari.app.  However, configuring these shortcuts only works sometimes in Safari 10.1 under macOS 10.12. The behavior is this:  ul liWhen pressed in a tab with an active text box, the caret moves to the beginning and end of the row instead/li liWhen pressed in a tab with history forwards or back, Safari goes forward or back in history instead/li liemOnly/em when pressed on a tab that doesn't have the two above conditions, Safari switches to the previous or next tab/li /ul  How can I disable the two other behaviors or configure the keys correctly so that I can use kbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbd⌘/kbd+kbd→/kbd as previous and next tab shortcuts?  <answer287804> You can use strongKeyboard Maestro/strong to overwrite that ambiguous behavior in Safari and map kbd⌘←/kbd/kbd⌘→/kbd to switch between tabs regardless of any context (text field, history availability), to make it work just like it does in Chrome. It's a pretty straightforward macro like "strongWhen ⌘← hotkey is pressed, execute “Previous Safari Tab” action/strong" in a macro folder limited to strongSafari/strong. However, Keyboard Maestro is not free.  Maybe you could also create a free Applescript service to run codeWindow⟶Show Next Tab/code command (since this command ignores context, unlike the respective keyboard shortcut) and change system shortcut kbd⌘←/kbd/kbd⌘→/kbd to run that service instead (would like need to add Safari to Accessibility to allow a script manipulating menu items).  <comment351004> I don't have a Mac in front of me to test and post a full answer, but it appears to have at some point been possible to edit application and/or system-wide key bindings using [System Preferences](https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/29/custom-safari-keyboard-shortcuts-save-my-sanity/) or a program like [KeyBindingsEditor](http://www.cocoabits.com/KeyBindingsEditor/). <comment351062> @chrstphrchvz I didn't find any references to the Home/End and history functionality in System Preferences. I also have Home/End already configured similar to what KeyBindingsEditor does. I think the problem is that Safari is not honoring these (for example, Home/End just goes one page up/down instead, same age Page Up/Page Down) <comment358698> [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) is another program I would've suggested, but unfortunately it's being [rewritten for Sierra](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/blob/master/README.md), and I'm not sure if it already can or ever will accommodate the goal here--it might be worth asking them e.g. on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osx-karabiner)
