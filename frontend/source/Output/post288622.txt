Why did my desktop and documents suddenly get renamed "Desktop - Local" and "Documents - Local"? <body> Here's my iCloud settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d2k4z.png" alt="icloud"  As you can see, the Desktop and Documents Folders checkbox is unchecked.   Despite this, my Desktop and Documents folders have suddenly been renamed to "Desktop - Local" and "Documents - Local" respectively.  The only reason I can think of is this may be due to installing iOS 11 on my iPhone, but I'm not sure.  Can anyone suggest any other possible reasons?  <answer288627> This is caused by iCloud Drive. This is to distinguish it with the Desktop and Documents folders on your iCloud Drive, which are named "Documents â€” iCloud", emeven if you didn't setup iCloud Drive on your Mac./em   The most probable cause, as found by the OP and me, is installing and running the new Files app on iOS 11.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q0VSA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment364482> Note that iCloud Drive already works on iOS 10.2, so it's probably not caused by iOS 11, but you might have turned this option on during the installation of it? <comment364483> It's already off as I've shown in my post. <comment364484> Hmmm ... strange. Maybe it's something which is cached by Finder. But even if you turned it off on your Mac, the iCloud Drive folder still exists. <comment364485> I've never turned it on before. <comment364487> iOS11 has a new program called "Files" which automatically creates a folder called Documents on your iCloud drive, this might be the culprit reversely turning on iCloud Documents and Desktop. <comment364488> Yeah, my further research is showing the same probable cause. You might want to post it as an answer yourself. <comment364489> You might as well, I couldn't find anything to back up my hunches.
