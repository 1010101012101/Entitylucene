How I can install GDB in NetBeans in Mavericks for debugging? <body> I have an error when I debug a C program in NetBeans.  precodeGDB has unexpectedly stopped with return 127 /code/pre  Here is a screenshot of the build tools:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQGH5.png" alt="Build Tools"  <answer216707> That's what I did to install GDB (under Yosemite):  ol liInstall codebrew/code: http://brew.sh/li liUpdate codebrew/code. If you already have installed codebrew/code, check for updates. In the terminal:/li /ol  b/b  precode$ brew update /code/pre  This step turned out to be decisive for me as, before updating, codebrew/code did not find any codegdb/code package:  precode$ brew install gdb # Error: No available formula for gdb /code/pre  And after that:  precode$ brew update $ brew search | grep gdb # cgdb gdb gdbm pgdbf /code/pre  ol start="3" liInstall gdb:/li /ol  b/b  precode$ brew install gdb /code/pre  ol start="4" liCodesign the binary following these instructions: http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin I copy them here for the sake of completeness and to add some comments:/li /ol     strongCreating a certificate/strong      ul   liStart Keychain Access application (code/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app/code)/li   liOpen menu code/Keychain Access/Certificate Assistant/Create a Certificate.../code/li   liChoose a name (codegdb-cert/code in the example), set codeIdentity Type/code to codeSelf Signed Root/code, set codeCertificate Type/code to codeCode Signing/code and select the codeLet me override defaults/code. Click several times on codeContinue/code until you get to the codeSpecify a Location For The Certificate/code screen, then set codeKeychain/code to codeSystem/code./li   liIf you can't store the certificate in the codeSystem/code keychain, create it in the codelogin/code keychain, then exported it.

In my case:  precode$ codesign -s gdb-cert /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.10/bin/gdb /code/pre   ol start="5" liUse either codegdb/code or the path where gdb was installed (for example, code/usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.10/bin/gdb/code) in the menu code/Netbeans/Preferences/C/C++/Build Tools/code field codeDebugger Command field/code./li /ol  <comment141613> Have you installed the Xcode command line tools? or looking at the tool collections why not use clang as Apple does nit supply a GNU compiler(gcc is a lnk to clang) <comment141621> yes i already installed command line tools, ok i will try with the clang.
