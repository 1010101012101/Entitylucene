Terminal output as a screensaver? <body> I want people to keep an eye on a script running in terminal whilst I'm away from my desk, but I don't trust them access to my machine.  Is there a way to show the terminal console as a screensaver, thus making it read-only and require login if they touch keyboard/mouse etc.  I'm aware of alternatives like logging to a log server they can access etc, however for now I'm only interested in outputting terminal as a screen saver. Is this possible with any known currently available screen saver software?  <answer106278> This may work, but looks to me like it needs quite a bit of work to make it go.  precodehttps://github.com/lunow/terminalscreensaver /code/pre  <comment124819> yeh that's the only one I came across, but like you say looks like it needs quite a bit of work to get it right :/ <comment124829> The other option would be to put the terminal full screen and then disable the keyboard. But then you would have to have a ssh session to re-enable it afterwards
