Can I connect a 3440x1440 display to my late 2013 27" iMac? <body> Currently I'm running an external 27"  2560x1440 apple cinema display from the thunderbolt port. I have a second thunderbolt port, so I was wondering if it's possible to also use a thunderbolt enabled 3440x1440 monitor, maybe like the LG 34UM95C. The computer is a late 2013 iMac with an NVIDIA GeForce GT 755M graphics card.br Thanks!  <answer233166> Everymac says your machine can support two external displays up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt, so I think the answer would be no.
