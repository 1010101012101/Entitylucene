Crop fails to work as expected on iOS8 Photos app <body> I'm struggling to do a simple edit on a photo in the standard Photos app on the new iOS8.  Basically, I can select a crop area, but the resulting saved photo doesn't match the area that I chose.  Here is a walk through example using screenshots of the steps I took:  First, a photo I just took as seen in the Photos app :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jum8Z.png" alt="http://cl.ly/image/3I2n392Q2M1k"  Now, I have clicked the codeEdit/code button from the previous photo, and applied a crop mask to trim the photo to the selected area. I've centred this on my nose :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uqcDg.png" alt="http://cl.ly/image/0w37080K2W1e"  I click codeDone/code in the previous picture, and the resulting saved image doesn't match what I just did, and is now centred on my left eye :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKRAW.png" alt="http://cl.ly/image/1W032N3K050F"  Any clues?  I note it only seems to happen on photos taken with the front facing camera, worked fine on a portion of screen shot, and also on a rear facing photo...  Can anyone reproduce? (If so, can you state what you used, e.g. the same iPad 3, or Mini or whatever)  <answer145823> I can't reproduce that behavior. All kidding aside about handsomeness - I'm getting the expected crop on all "selfie" camera shots.  I've tested on the original iPhone mini and iPhone 5 with iOS 8 so far.  It's almost like a retina bug where it's counting pixels instead of points. Perhaps it's a 2x error that needs to be reported to Apple if you can reproduce it on another device that's the same hardware as yours.  <answer146402> It seems that this is indeed a bug, that can be reproduced by various other people.  There's nothing I am doing wrong, it's just not working.  I have submitted a bug report to Apple.  If you get this issue too, then please report it here or here.  The more reports they get, the faster it may get fixed.  <comment171832> Heh - I can't reproduce that. The dude looks a lot different on my crop. <comment171834> Is your crop accurate after you save the edit though?  I realise my dude may look more handsome than yours, but it's the accuracy I need to check, not the hot or not rating ;) <comment171882> The scale seems right, it more seems like the exif is wrong, like it's showing me portrait then cropping landscape, or something. <comment171988> I get the same results on a different photo of mine. This stinks! <comment171989> Not just me then - phew! <comment171991> I have a cropping problem on my iPad 3 in iOS8. It's fine cropping a pic taken with the front facing camera. However, if I crop a pic grabbed off the internet, the area it saves is totally different to what I had selected. <comment171992> I've not tried a grabbed photo.  Can you check if your rear camera and screenshot pics (hold home then press lock to take a screenshot) work as normal?  I'll grab a pic off the net and try <comment172147> Ok, rear facing pic, takes and crops just fine. Same for a screen grab. BUT picture saved off the internet will not crop accurately. I tried to upload the pictures here to show the difference, but it's taking forever (everything is slower with iOS8) and my patience is wearing thin!;-) <comment172148> Are you sure your internet is fine? <comment172149> Yes definitely! :-)
