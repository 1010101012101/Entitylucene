Quotes problem in Mavericks (or TextEdit) <body> TextEdit in Mavericks changes the standard double quotes code"Hello"/code to using curly, non-ascii quotation marks code“Hello”/code.  It does this even when you edit plain text documents.  Is there a way to prevent this new behavior in Mavericks?  <answer120488> This is not just TextEdit, it's Mavericks.  Under System Preferences  Keyboard, you can change the quotation marks.  Go to the 'Text' sub-menu.  On the right-hand side of the box, uncheck the "Use smart quotes and dashes" checkbox.  <answer171855> The following procedure worked for me:  In TextEdit select all your text by pressing kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd-kbdA/kbd and then go to Edit  Substitutions and uncheck Smart Quotes. Make sure Smart Quotes is not active and it should be solved.  <answer224587> If you already unchecked System Preferences  Keyboard  Text  Use smart quotes and dashes.   There's also a checkmark on TextEdit  Preferences  "Smart quotes" (I don't know the translation but it something like that).  Be sure to uncheck that one too.  <comment160774> For those that still can't find it, more specifically: System Preferences  Keyboard  Text  Uncheck the "Use smart quotes and dashes" checkbox. <comment236751> For the ones which already have a file damaged with this little hanging worms (I mean `‟ ″`), look at the answer from igaar: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/171855/22003 . <comment344088> "Smart quotes"? More like... "Dumb quotes". <comment371414> This should be the correct answer. <comment371415> @Rob, Are you sure it's the problem with the OS itself? Then why do other apps not have this problem except for Textedit?
