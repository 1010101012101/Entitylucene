Mac will not boot into OSX after installing windows 10 <body> Please help me I'm completely desparate. I have tried to install Windows 10 and it completely messed up my macbook pro system, I cannot boot into my mac, and it's full with things I desperately need.  My OSX doesn't show up in the Macs start up when pressing "option". Also, Pressing "boot into os x" from windows doesn't work either but just boots into windows OS all over again.  Using internet recovery mode, I see in diskutility all the drives except the boot camp drive are unmounted and grey, and their names changed from "macintosh hd" etc that they were to default names, and they are impossible to mount.  Attached the screenshot of my disk utility, and of diskutil list, diskutil cs list (nothing) and -r show /dev/disk0  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ii07wCC.jpg" alt="disk utility" img src="https://i.imgur.com/MHXSrhx.jpg" alt="diskutil list" img src="https://i.imgur.com/PVO9Laf.jpg" alt="-r show /dev/disk0"  The mac system should be installed on the one labeled disk0s2.. I have no idea what's going on and how it happend  <answer244744> The GUID types for partitions 2 and 3 are wrong. The both current values are codeDE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC/code, which indicates two "Windows Recovery Environment" partitions. The procedure given below can correct type partition types, but there is no guarantee the data (OS X) did not get overwritten while installing Windows.  ol liBoot using Internet Recovery./li liEnter the command given below to get the GPT partition data.  precodegpt -r show /dev/disk0 /code/pre  Below is an example of from my computer.

This time, be very careful about which partition you select. <comment301642> No backup, any other ideas? <comment301654> first of all thanks. when I try to do it though, the second part (number 5), I get "error: no space available on device". Help? Now this number 2 doesn't exist any more and in disk utility, I see those 92GB as "free space". waiting for further suggestion to handle the error <comment301657> current gpt -r show: ![link to photo of current situation](http://i.imgur.com/ShEANII.jpg) <comment301663> Sorry, I made a mistake in Step 5. I made a correction. You will need to continue from where I indicated in Step 4. No harm was done. <comment301672> Dear David you have officially saved my life. I Truly cannot thank you enough. <comment301687> Luckily it looks like you got out of a bad situation this time.  Next time you may not be so lucky.  In the future **always** make a backup before you make *any* change that could take down your system.  I even make backups before applying updates from Apple.  Time Machine is perfect for this and reloading the disk from a backup has saved me several times when things have unexpectedly gone wrong.
