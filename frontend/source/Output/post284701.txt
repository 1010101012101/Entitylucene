How to use BetterTouchTool to show Mail.app unread count in touch bar <body> I have a MacBook Pro with a touch bar and have never used BetterTouchTool. I know it has touch bar functionality, like adding a button to open an app. Is it possible to show either of the following?  ul liThe Mail.app icon (with unread email count)/li liJust the number of unread emails/li /ul  If so, how can it be accomplished?  <answer285640> BetterTouchTool has a "widget" option for the touch bar, and one of the options is to display the output of an AppleScript program. You could write a script that gets the number of unread emails (another question has some code for doing that here)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/caZz4.png" alt="enter image description here"
