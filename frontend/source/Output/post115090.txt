Defining some global GIT settings to be automatically inherited <body> h1Sysnopsis/h1  Coming from a Linux background I still find Apples' modifications to the Unix hierarchy somewhat confusing.  Nevertheless these subtle changes make it difficult for me to quickly do what I need.  ul liI shall explain my scenario in a linux setting as it would make the most sense, then hope someone can translate this into BSD/OS X lingo./li liI do not like GUI-based things if theres a CLI alternative./li /ul  h1Problem/h1  I recently installed GIT so I could work on a number of projects from my MacBook, in linux one can define default config settings in code/etc/gitconfig/code which is first loaded into the users' configuration and then merged with code~/.gitconfig/code.  When I create this default global git configuration file inside code/etc/gitconfig/code it has not effect when I run my aliases, unless I specifically define them for each user on the machine.  Could someone please suggest to me exactly how this default behaviour works on OS X?  <answer115101> This might help someone I found this config in the following location: code/usr/local/git/etc/gitconfig/code  <answer115104> You can try   precodegit config --system -e  /code/pre  and  precodegit config --global -e  /code/pre  to open the system and global config files in an editor. That will tell you what path codegit/code is looking for those files, by looking at the file it opens.  <answer131523> You won't believe it, but after installing Xcode 5.1.1 in Mavericks 10.9.3, now the code--system/code path for my codegitconfig/code is  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/etc/ /code/pre
