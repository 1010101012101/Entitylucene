Spotlight icon missing on Yosemite <body> The Spotlight icon isn't showing up in the upper right; even if I try to launch it manually from core services, nothing happens. I'm running Yosemite.   How can I get the icon back?  <answer177884> Hope this works for you it did for me! Use Terminal  precodesudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search /code/pre  Then type in the following command:  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  After issuing these two commands, you'll notice that the Spotlight application will re-appear in the menubar of OS X.
