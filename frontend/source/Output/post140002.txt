White frames round thumbnails in finder <body> Every time I modified an image on my old iMac it would reappear without a white border round it, which was useful as I could instantly see which images I'd worked on and which I hadn't. I don't have this feature on my new iMac, why? and how do I get it on?  <comment164965> Can you show examples as this is pretty broad and unclear because we have no idea what image-tool you're talking about etc. <comment164970> â€¦or what white border you are referring to. A screenshot would be extremely helpful here.
