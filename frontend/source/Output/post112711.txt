Does use of memory with timing CL=10 instead of Apple used CL=11 slow my Mac down? <body> After reading Why is 8GB, Ballistix 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-12800 memory module showing as not compatible with Macbook Pro mid 2012? on the Crucial forum, and the response from Crucial:     use our Apple branded Crucial memory   which doesn't explain the why it is not compatible,  I am curious whether memory modules that use different (lower) timings than Apple's modules with CL11 timing:  ol liWill the Crucial Ballistix BX Sport CL10 [BLS8G3N18AES4CEU/BLS2C8G3N18AES4CEU] modules work?/li liAnd what will be the performance penalty or benefit?/li /ol  <answer112712> Yes, Crucial Ballistix Sport memory modules with strongCL=10/strong timing strongdo work/strong.
