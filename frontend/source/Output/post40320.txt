How to assign to the "home" key the action "Go to the start of line" Globally <body> Is there a way in which I can replicate the Windows way of going to the start of line by using kbdhome/kbd and not kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd&larr;/kbd ?   I did it in Eclipse, but I'd rather do it globally. I'm using Snow Leopard 10.6.8  <answer41377> If you don't mind a third party application, KeyRemap4Macbook can do it for you (and a whole lot more too).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8O9UR.png" alt="KeyRemap4Macbook"  <comment46895> No i don't mind, tomorrow i'll give it a try!
