Photos from iPad to iCloud? <body> I shoot a photo in iPad. I want it will be available in iCloud. How can I do it? I cannot see the PhotoStream in iCloud.  I can see all Pages, Numbers etc documents but not photos, I find this very confusing.  <answer69600> You can't access pictures from Safari by going www.icloud.com.  You have to enable Photo Streaming form emSettings/em  emiCloud/em  emPhoto Stream/em.  Then you will find the Photo Streaming picture under the tab emPhoto Stream/em in the emPhotos/em App.  <answer69601> You cannot view your Photo Stream pictures directly on iCloud.com. In order to do this you need to create a new Photo Stream from you iPad, iPhone or Mac (using iPhoto or Aperture).  Here's a guide for doing so. In order to make it public on iCloud.com, make sure you flip the "Public Website" switch.  <comment80851> Can you better explain how did you try to access the pictures please? <comment80852> @lucaghera icloud.com <comment80853> I did this and I added a photo to the photo-stream but I cannot find the photo in iCloud.com. Where will the photos end up? <comment80854> The url is made available underneath Public Website flip switch in the user interface. It will not show up on iCloud.com directly. <comment80855> Thank you, works! Had to just store the cumbersome url to bookmark -- cannot understand why Apple does this so hard, perhaps image-content-hosting is expensive.
