How do I move an iCloud calendar item to Exchange? <body> Until I upgraded (?) to macOS Sierra, each Calendar item, when editing, showed a pull down in the upper right with all of my calendars. I could easily move an item from any calendar to any other calendar by selecting the destination pull down.  Now in Sierra (10.12.1), the pull downs for an iCloud calendar include emonly/em the other iCloud calendars. The pull down for the Exchange calendar has no other calendar. I cannot find a way to move an item from iCloud to Exchange or Exchange to iCloud.  Furthermore, when I received some calendar invites on my Exchange email account, they went to an iCloud calendar! (Which is how I ended up here in the first place.) Even though it was an Exchange email, and even though the Exchange calendar is my default calendar.  Calendar seems to be a downgrade in Sierra.  How can I move a Calendar item between calendar types? How do I get new invites to go to my Exchange calendar?
