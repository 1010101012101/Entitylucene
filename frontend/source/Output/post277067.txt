"This day in history" dynamic slideshow <body> My goal is to use an iPad as a photo picture frame on my wall.  I have a large library of family photos over the last decade-plus.   What I want is a "this day in history" slideshow that shows photos from this date (e.g.  March 20) from any of those years.  I am wondering if this is possible with smart albums or any existing apps if needed.  The library could live in a photos app on a local iMac.   I can write Python code if it helps.  For example, every midnight make a temporary folder of files for the day.  With that though, I'm not sure how to point an iPad slide show to a remote directory.  I would also love to avoid writing code if possible.   <comment351083> Have you found any solution? I'm looking for pretty much the same... <comment351173> Not yet, but I'm pleased to have some company on this quest.  My best guess right now is a smart album on a desktop machine, some Python or AppleScript to update it at midnight, and then a slideshow of the smart album (if possible on iPad). <comment352406> I was thinking about setting up a webpage that would slideshow, and then opening it in Safari, but didn't have any time to move beyond concept phase :-) <comment352463> A Website is a good idea.  Then it could work anywhere as well (like at work).  ipad could be put into kiosk mode (guided access) and work like a frame.  In this case, the challenge becomes managing thre library on the server side.  It would be great to just use the photos app... I wonder if it could somehow act as a "database" behind a Django website.   And yes, no time to do.  It's children that make me want the slide show and children that (happily) mean no extra time for projects.
