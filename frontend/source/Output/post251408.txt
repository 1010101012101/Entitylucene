iMac Internet Surfing Issue <body> I have an iMac (Retina 5K 27", Mid 2015) with OS X Yosemite v10.10.2. I am connecting to my network with a cable but when i type an address or refresh the page, the loading icon appears in favicon, but it keeps turning forever and the page is doing nothing. I have to refresh or re-enter the site like 4 or 5 times to make it work. Sometimes even that is not enough. I am pressing stop several times and refreshing it to make it work.  1) I have encountered this situation both on Chrome and Safari. Don't think this is browser based.  2) I have switched from cable to Wi-Fi but same problem still continuous.  3) There are 7 machines in my network, 6 Windows + 1 Mac, but Windows computers are not experiencing this issue. Everything is fine for them.  4) We are not using a server in the network. Computers are directly accessing the switch or access point and those are reaching the modem directly.  This really annoying. Can anybody help?  <answer251417> Check your network connection.   ul liOpen System Preferences/li liClick on Network, on the button Assist me... and then on diagnostics./li liChoose your Network e.g. LAN and check the connection./li /ul  If you have at this point no problems  ul liClick on the Network Window on the button Options.. and to the DNS Register. /li liCheck if any other DNS entries are there unless the standard entries from your Router./li liIf additional entries you can delete them if you click on the minus (-) button below./li /ul  Check if the problem exists.
