Faulty magsafe 2 diagnosis <body> I found a Magsafe 2 60W power adapter in the electronics trash and I would like to find out where it's fault is.  I am pretty sure I can handle most of the common repairs on the chargers. I am asking, because I would prefer to leave the body of the adapter intact instead of prying it apart to measure if and where the cable is broken. If the electronics are gone I don't think I'd be able to save the adapter.  So far I measured the pin voltages (the + to ground voltage should be 3V for Magsafe 2), but I can't get any reading which is not 0.  I don't have a Magsafe 2 device, only Magsafe 1.  ~edit:br I measure 218kOhm between + and ground,br 640kOhm between the center pin and +br 420kOhm between the center pin and groundbr  (Is electronics SE the better community to ask?)  <comment293124> If you decide you do need to open the adapter to determine the problem I'd suggest looking at a method I found when I thought I needed to open a Magsafe adapter that looks like it would work well and allow the adapter to be reassembled neatly:   http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-open-and-replace-the-MagSafe-cord-on-an-App  (I haven't yet tried it myself so judge it for yourself before trying it.) <comment293127> @Zhora: Yes, I saw a guy on youtube doing the same: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1HYBqeWSHI beware of the charged parts inside when opening. However, I would like not to open the charger if possible. <comment293140> Yes, I think electronics SE would be the better community to ask. But just leave your post here for now.
