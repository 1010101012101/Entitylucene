How do I create terminal session independent env vars on OS 10.10? <body> I read Mortimer's answer here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25385934/setting-environment-variables-via-launchd-conf-no-longer-works-in-os-x-yosemite and added this file in /Users/MyName/Library/LaunchAgents called environment.plist:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"      "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;my.startup&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;sh&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;     launchctl setenv GRADLE_HOME /Applications/gradle-2.0      launchctl setenv JAVA_HOME     /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_71.jdk/Contents/Home     &lt;/string&gt;    &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Restarted my laptop, opened a terminal, and ran echo $GRADLE_HOME but it is still blank.  How do I set an env var that is persistent throughout terminal sessions in Mac OS 10.10?  <answer162643> shut down and start the computer again.  open the terminal and type echo $ENV_VAR and you should see the value you defined.  <comment190187> I don't understand plists very well, nor `launchd`, and I have avoided the Yosemite 'upgrade', but the payload of `ProgramArguments`looks funny to me: if the multiline string is passed as an argument to "sh", how is sh to know that there are two `launchtctl`s to be executed? <comment190188> perhaps I didn't restart like I thought; I shut down and powered on, now it works. <comment190189> What happens if you delete the line `launchctl setenv GRADLE_HOME /Applications/gradle-2.0` (so meaning there is only one command passed to sh)? <comment190190> Post that as an answer: it might be useful to someone who has not done that properly as you did.
