Video resolution changing <body> While watching YouTube videos on my iMac, the screen intermittently switches to a lower resolution (the video gets blurry).  Then, after 5 or 10 seconds it switches back to normal imagery.  The symptom is the same even when I'm using Apple TV.  What's happening???    <comment193011> it's probably auto-sensing the download speed & changing resolution accordingly. Forcing it to the higher rez would probably give you periodic 'Bufferingâ€¦' warnings. Check you can actually get data as fast as the stream needs. Wire up if you're using wifi. <comment193381> Tetsujin,   That's a reasonable explanation.  I'm using DSL, and I'm becoming less and less satisfied with its performance.  I'll have to start looking into a speed  upgrade.  Thanks for responding!
