Is there a usable iOS4 Terminal App? <body> Mobile Terminal 426 appears to be the only non-crashing iOS4 Terminal App. Unfortunately it's missing all of its convenience features, like gestures. Are there alternatives?  <answer539> I use iSSH: http://www.zinger-soft.com/iSSH_features.html It's available on the app store, but if you're jailbroken you can ssh to 127.0.0.1 and it works just fine.  Costs $10 though.  <answer1241> If by terminal you mean SSH (or telnet): I have used TouchTerm (from way back when it was for free, now its 4$) and iSSH.   I like TouchTerm better on the iPhone as I find the semi-transparent keyboard better.  I prefer iSSH on the iPad because it has a real iPad version.  Also iSSH has a VNC client and an X server that can be tunneled over SSH. But its 10$.  <comment500> That's for jailbroken iOS isn't it? <comment501> Yes, forgot to mention. <comment529> From personal experience: Avoid pTerm. <comment613> Seems to be the best option available. <comment51017> iSSH has vnc? Really? <comment55866> iSSH has VNC (and RDP) client capabilities (even tunneled over SSH): http://www.zinger-soft.com/iSSH_features.html
