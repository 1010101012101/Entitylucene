Word for mac 2011 - How to use ONLY the custom dictionary? <body> I would like to use spelling corrections in Word for mac 2011. Since my language (slovenian) is not included, I had to find and include a custom dictionary.  The installation goes like this:  I import the dictionary, and have to select the language. If I select slovenian (and set the Tools - Language... to Default slovenian), no text is underlined at all. If I select a different language instead, for example swedish (also in Tools - Language...), the misspelled words are underlined correctly. However, words that are included in the swedish dictionary are emnot/em underlined, and the suggestions for underlined words are both slovenian and swedish.  How can I properly set up my dictionary so no other languages would be interfering?
