Firefox on El Capitan cannot create profile in standard folder <body> Firefox was refusing to launch on my MacOS El Capitan. Console gave me the following message:     codecom.apple.xpc.launchd: (org.mozilla.firefox.320352[6799]) Service exited with abnormal code: 1/code   In the course of troubleshooting this, I must have happened upon the Profile Manager. While attempting to create a new profile in the standard folder (code~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles//code), I saw the following error:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/mKtayw8.png" alt="error" title="firefox error"  I had the Profile Manger save the profile to the Desktop, and now Firefox works. But I'd like to get it working normally, i.e., saving the profile to the standard folder—largely because I am having issues in other applications which might also be related to screwy permissions.  The permissions on the Profiles folder are: coderwx--------- (700)/code.  Any clues on how I can have Firefox store its profiles in the standard folder?  <answer276514> This issue, as well as issues I was having with iTunes and f.lux, were resolved by resetting permissions on the home folder. Before doing this, I had upgraded to Sierra from El Capitan. So the reset process I used is for Sierra. It's included below, and the original can be found here.   h2Reset permissions/h2If the issue occurred after changing the permissions of items in your home folder, follow these steps to reset the permissions: ol liFrom the Finder menu bar, choose Go &gt; Home.

That’s what the permissions look like on my system. <comment348020> @Phong That probably would have worked. My solution, included as an answer below, is more general, probably applying 755 permissions recursively to the whole user folder, which may have been overkill. We'll see. <comment348026> I searched at least ten minutes for documentation of the `diskutil resetUserPermissions` command and found nothing.
