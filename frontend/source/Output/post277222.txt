iTerm white bar showing over tabs <body> Since upgrading to Sierra on my new 2017 MBP i've got a very annoying bug that I can't seem to find a solution for.   I've got a white bar showing over my iTerm window every time iTerm is the front-most in-focus app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZX51F.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried the solution from this question but it didn't really help: White bar over menu bar?
