missing /usr/bin/gnutar on Mavericks (MacPorts) <body> MacPorts is complaining about missing code/usr/bin/gnutar/code on Mavericks  precode:info:extract sh: /usr/bin/gnutar: No such file or directory /code/pre  codegnutar/code is indeed not there anymore.  As suggested here I tried to change the tar command in code/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf/code:  precodetar_command=/usr/bin/tar -0 /code/pre  with no effect.  Any suggestion? Did I configure codetar_command/code in the wrong file? Is there another workaround?  <answer106195> I downloaded the sources from:  http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/  Compiled the usual GNU way:  precode./configure make /code/pre  Afterwards I manually copied the generated binary as /usr/bin/gnutar. I am not sure were it is built, but I believe it was as ./src/tar  Of course, this was just a quick hack to install new ports. I would not upgrade all the ports (as recommended for OS upgrades) until there is an official MacPorts version supporting Mavericks.  Also, remember to delete that file before the next MacPorts version. Just to keep things clean.  <answer106209> My dirty hack was a symlink to system tar command.  precodesudo ln -s /usr/bin/tar /usr/bin/gnutar /code/pre  <answer106260> The problem is that your version of MacPorts was not built on Mavericks and assumes the tools that were there when it was installed are still available. Since this is no longer the case, you should re-install MacPorts, which will automatically fix this issue.  strikeSince there is no binary installer for Mavericks at the moment, you will have to build from source instead. Make sure you have installed the Command Line Tools using codexcode-select --install/code before you attempt to run code./configure/code in the MacPorts source tree. See http://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.subversion for a how-to./strike  strikeIf you don't want to build a development version from source, a binary installer will be made available in the next few days./strike  strongEdit:/strong A binary installer for Mavericks (for the 2.2.1 bugfix release) is now available: https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1-10.9-Mavericks.pkg.  Note that you should still run codexcode-select --install/code in any case, strongeven/strong if you do have Xcode installed and use the binary installer.  Since this keeps getting referenced: If you just updated to Mavericks you should also follow https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration.  <answer106411> h2Edit:/h2  This is strongnot/strong a permanent Solution! It is still recommended to reinstall MacPorts.  strongQuick solution:/strong  emEdit:/em  precode/opt/local/share/macports/Tcl/macports1.0/macports_autoconf.tcl /opt/local/share/macports/Tcl/port1.0/port_autoconf.tcl /code/pre  emChange:/em  precodevariable tar_command "/usr/bin/gnutar --no-same-owner" /code/pre  to  precodevariable tar_command "/usr/bin/tar -o" /code/pre  <answer106521> Use codeTerminal.app/code (under code/Applications/Utilities/code) and run the command:  precodesudo ln -s /usr/bin/bsdtar /usr/bin/gnutar /code/pre  <answer106522> You can also install gnutar from Macports. That helped me to compile octave-devel, in particular one of its dependencies - atlas.   precodesudo port install gnutar /code/pre  <answer120282> "The problem is that your version of MacPorts was not built on Mavericks"  Full instructions can be found here: https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration  <comment124776> Did you upgrade Xcode? If so, did you add the Command Line Tools? <comment124777> Command Line Tools upgrade didn't help, but crysaz dirty hack helped. <comment124820> You also need to poitconfigure to the Xcode provided tcl <comment124853> A reinstall solved the problem (and several others :-) <comment124888> @Mark: No, you don't, if you have run `xcode-select --install`. Doing so will install `tclConfig.sh` in `/usr/lib`, which is where the MacPorts configure script looks for it by default. Note that just installing Xcode and **not** running `xcode-select --install` is not enough! <comment125077> This is kind of recursive: MacPorts is complaining about the missing gnutar. To use MacPort to install gnutar I should be able to user MacPorts. <comment125079> MacPorts is discouraging the hack: https://twitter.com/macports/status/393296788062355456 <comment125080> MacPorts is discouraging the hack: twitter.com/macports/status/393296788062355456 <comment125790> it DID work for me. MacPorts does not complain about gnu tar when you install it. It only complains when installing atlas. So before installing atlas you can install gnu tar with NO PROBLEM! <comment125795> It did not work for me. I got the error message while installing gnutar ... <comment140303> Welcome to Ask Different! While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.

Now everything is working for me. <comment143570> He's right, the Migration instructions should be referenced. I've edited my answer to include them. <comment144357> this is probably why editing the corresponding entry in `/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf` does not solve the original poster's problem <comment146133> @neverpanic - +1 I think you just saved my day.
