OS X El Capitan auto-correction crazy <body> Auto-correct in my email is correcting the word to something that makes no sense, before I'm even done writing it. IE I was trying to write correct but it keeps changing emcorr/em to emcore/em before I can finish writing the whole word even though I am not pausing.  I have OS X El Capitan 10.11.6  <answer249763> If you want to turn it off, go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Text (tab)  and unselect auto-correction.  If you want to do more, then on the same page you can tell it what language to auto-correct (if you don't want it for all languages you use on your Mac) or specific words (on the right you click the "+" to add specific auto-corrections.  If you want to disable auto-correction of a single word, then look at this answer already given: Answer already given for "Can I disable auto-correction of a single word on OS X"
