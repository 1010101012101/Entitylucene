Mail.app notification filtering <body> Is it possible to disable notification generated by Mail.app for a certain set of folders?  For e.g. if have codeInbox/code and codeInbox &gt; fol1/code &amp; codeInbox &gt; fol2/code, I want notification from codeInbox/code and codefol1/code only.  Would this be possible with growl somehow?  <answer6491> You should be able to do this by setting up Rules in Mail.app that filter on the criteria you desire and then run an AppleScript that triggers a Growl notification. Rules are setup in Mail.app under Preferencesâ€¦-Rules.  Growl can be called from AppleScript as shown here.  <answer130953> Use Smart Mailboxes to filter the mailboxes viewable,  http://www.cultofmac.com/185867/only-get-notifications-for-a-specific-mailbox-in-mountain-lion-os-x-tips/  <comment6754> basically, there are some annoying folders with tonnes of emails coming in which i really should convert to digests, but I digress. I don't want notifications for these folders, only for a select few. And while growl can be invoked that way, I will have to somehow disable all notification and then add this logic and rules for each folder, am I right? <comment6755> Essentially, yes. <comment6759> @ohmantics You can choose to have GrowlMail only show notifications for Inbox (Mail  Preferences  GrowlMail  Only notify for emails in your Inbox). <comment6760> Mail rules only run on mail that is in the Inbox. If you are moving the messages on the client side (in Mail.app) you could add the Growl notification (via AppleScript) there, if your mail is filtered on the server then this will not work. <comment6762> yup, that is what I am using now <comment6763> Yup, I am doing server side filtering. What i was wondering was if there was a way to filter messages in growl based on text, cause the subjects have folder names. That could be a way of doing this. Maybe I should ask a separate question <comment6772> Growl doesn't have the kind of filtering you're looking for. Adding one rule per folder name in Mail.app isn't that complicated. Once you make one rule that works the way you want, you can just duplicate it and edit the new folder name in.
