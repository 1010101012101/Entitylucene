How to insert TAB in Messages & Notes on Mac & iPhone <body> Within codeNotes/code on Mac, it is straight forward to insert a kbdtab/kbd.  I would like to achieve the same result within codeNotes/code on iPhone, most probably through defining a new keyboard shortcut.  Is this possible?  I would also like to insert a kbdtab/kbd in Messages on Mac and iPhone, once again most probably through defining new keyboard shortcuts.  Is this possible?  <comment348006> I added comments to this referenced question more than 2 years ago. Since this time this problem didn't received an appropriate answer. This is the reason I try today to formulate it anew with a more limited scope.
