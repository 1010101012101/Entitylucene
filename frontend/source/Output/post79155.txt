Can't access AppStore when connected via 3G <body> When my iPhone (3GS) is connected via 3G, I can't connect to the AppStore. It just loads a while and then says "Could not connect" and that's that.  When I have a WLAN connection, everything works fine.  This has been like this for quite some time now - it also didn't change after rebooting or updating to new versions of iOS.  What's going wrong there?   <answer281858> I also had a problem where the App Store was working on Wi-Fi, but not on 3G and 4G networks. I solved it by going into:  strongSettings/strong â†’ strongMobile Data/strong (also called strongCellular/strong). Under the heading strongUse Mobile Data For/strong, emenable/em strongApp Store/strong.  <comment92118> are you able to browse websites on 3G, else your Cellular Data settings might be incorrect (Settings - General - Cellular - Cellular Data Network) <comment92119> Yes. I can browse Websites, use apps that need Network connections, send Messages in WhatsApp, everything except accessing the AppStore.
