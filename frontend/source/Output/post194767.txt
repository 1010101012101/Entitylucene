How do I use cmd+1 as a keyboard shortcut? cmd+2, cmd+3, etc, work <body> In Preferences  Profiles  Keys I've mapped kbdcmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd through kbdcmd/kbd+kbd9/kbd but kbdcmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd alone does not respond.  Does anyone else have this issue?  This is for the latest iterm2, v2.1.1 and several earlier versions as well; it has never worked for me.  <answer194862> I haven't used iTerm but it sounds like the kbdcmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd might be used somewhere else in your system. Try looking inside System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts and look around to see if the shortcut you want to use is already taken by the system or another application.  <answer194866> If you look at the OS X Keyboard Shortcuts, you will see that the keystroke Command-1 through 4 are already assigned to finder which means 5 through 9 are available for mapping.  And speaking of which...OS X once allowed you to create your own mappings and that feature seems to have been conveniently removed.  I reccomend taking a look at Karabiner  which will not only allow you to remap your keys, but also change all the related settings.  Karabiner should allow you to change the mappings of Command-1 through 4 as well.  <answer254612> The problem is that strongiterm2/strong uses kbdcmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd, kbdcmd/kbd+kbd2/kbd ... etc for switching between tabs by default. As long as you have first tab, kbdcmd/kbd+kbd1/kbd is binded to switch to the this tab.  Workaround is to change emKeys - Navigation shortcuts - To switch tabs:/em value to kbdalt/kbd or any other except kbdcmd/kbd.  <answer292665> iTerm2 → Preferences → key → Navigation Shortcuts → To switch split panes. Replace it with other keys, then kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd1/kbd will work.  <comment232824> Karabiner seems great. I havn't actually created the keymap I need yet, just looking through docs. I'd like cmd+1 to map to ctrl+b 1 for tmux. <comment369272> How does this differ from an existing information with the same information?
