Command line tools to replace bytes in a file <body> I need to write a script that patches a few bytes at a particular offset in a binary file. I know of textual tools for this task (sed, though I find it utterly hard to use) but can't find one for binary patching. Are there any?  If not installed by default, anything I can install with Homebrew would be acceptable as well.  <answer139685> You can achieve it with codedd/code command. Here's an example:  precode$ hexdump StringComparison  | head -1 0000000 cf fa ed fe 07 00 00 01 03 00 00 80 02 00 00 00  $ printf '\x11\x11\x11' | dd of=StringComparison bs=1 seek=4 count=3 conv=notrunc 3+0 records in 3+0 records out 3 bytes transferred in 0.000293 secs (10238 bytes/sec)  $ hexdump StringComparison  | head -1 0000000 cf fa ed fe 11 11 11 01 03 00 00 80 02 00 00 00 /code/pre  Explanation:  ul liof = input file/li libs = block size/li liseek = position (offset)/li linotrunc = do not truncate the output./li /ul  <comment164643> Perl maybe? Supports seek() etc. <comment164646> Yeah, Perl is even worse than sed for me :)  But if you can supply a working perl command where I specify file path, offset and bytes to write, then you'll have a winner. <comment164734> Smart! And I now remember I even used `dd` a few years back for similar tasks.
