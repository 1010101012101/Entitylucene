Where is the terminal application on the filesystem? <body> I want to be able to launch a Terminal window using JiTouch, which allows me to make a gesture open a file, so I want to know the location of the Terminal app so that I can open it.  <answer2562> Is this all you want?  code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/code  <comment2263> Yeh, that is it. I just retried searching with spotlight and saw that it was actually finding it - it was just down the bottom! <comment2293> A little bit of Spotlight cleverness allows you learn where an  item is by Cmd-clicking or Cmd-returning its entry in the Spotlight list.  Instead of launching the item, it will open a finder window to the item's parent folder with the item highlighted.  Besides showing you where that item resides, it lets you do lots of things to it - delete it, move it, or open it with a non-default application.  My favorite, for a PDF or a spreadsheet, is to just touch space to open it with QuickView. <comment35445> Whoa!! JiTouch rocks!!!!!!
