Can I submit dictionary file to Mac App Store? <body> I have created a .dictionary file for the Dictionary.app in mac and I want to submit it to the Mac App Store. I'm curious, is it possible? If yes, how?  <answer252493> You can't upload 'plugins / extentions' to the Mac App Store. Only full 'apps' will be approved for the mac app store. To create a mac app, you need a developer license to be able to publish your app through the Mac App Store.  <comment314200> Where did the data in your dictionary come from?  Is it free for public use? <comment314377> You can flag this post as answered if this helped.
