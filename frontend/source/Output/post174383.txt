Yosemite keyboard shortcut for "keep both" "stop" or "replace" when moving files in Finder? <body> When you strongcopy or move files in the Finder/strong in Yosemite and there is a conflict, a small dialog box pops up proposing:  precodekeep both    stop    replace /code/pre  (or "skip" if you press option).  strongHowever, I can't find any way to choose one of the options with the keyboard./strong  There's no default option. Cmd-R doesn't work for replace. Escape does nothing.  I've tried strongevery combination I can think of/strong and nothing works.  strongAre there keyboard shortcuts to choose these options?/strong  <answer174384> You can enable keyboard control in strongPreferences/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3PiZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  With this, You can switch between buttons with kbd⇥ TAB/kbd and select it with Space. Active button will have blue border.  NOTE: default buttons (all blue) are still clickable with kbd⏎ RETURN/kbd.  <comment205326> Thanks, that works great. I will be curious to see if the extra functionality is annoying elsewhere (on web pages for example). <comment215019> Awesome, I didn't know about that. Took me a sec to realize even the "apply to all button" is included in this
