Can the Macbook Pro drive two Ultra HD monitors at 60FPS each? <body> I'm referring to the 2015 Macbook Pro, 15-inch, with the AMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2GB GDDR5 memory. Can this drive two Ultra HD monitors (3840 x 2160) at 60FPS each? If so, would you be able to simultaneously use the built-in display?  To be clear, I'm referring to SST (single-stream transport) monitors, not MST (multi-stream transport).  You'd have to plug each monitor into a Thunderbolt port, since HDMI supports only 30FPS. Are both Thunderbolt ports on different Thunderbolt buses, or the same? In the latter case, there may not be enough bandwidth.  <answer196660> According to this document https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154 The MacBook Pro (15-inch and 17-inch, Early 2011) and later have Thunderbolt2 and can handle two thunderbolt displays (2560x1440).  According to this document https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202856 The MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013 and later) can handle one MST 4K display at 60Hz.  You can run one 4K monitor off of the Thunderbolt display at 60z and a second off HDMI at 30Hz. the two thunderbolt ports are connected. Once you try to connect a second 4K monitor to the other port, you will go over the bandwidth and the second monitor will go dark.  <comment235083> I clarified the question to say that I'm talking about SST monitors, not MST. Do you have a source for "you will go over bandwidth"? Or is it from personal experience? <comment235147> 4K@60Hz is required up to 16Gbps. Thunderbolt2 is comprised of PCIe2.0 and displayport1.2 wrapped into one. The bandwidth of Thunderbolts 2 is 20Gbps. Math... it's a killer. <comment235629> Right, I meant to ask: is there a source to back up your claim that both ports are on the same Thunderbolt bus? Thanks for your help. <comment235630> There is only one thunderbolt controller for the MacBook Pro <comment235814> And one controller means only one bus? <comment235816> Bandwidth is limited to the controller not the bus. The only Apple product which will do what you ask is the Mac Pro.
