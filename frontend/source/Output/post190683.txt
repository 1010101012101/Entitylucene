Is my unsaved Quicktime player movie recording still on the hard drive somewhere? <body> I recorded a movie (File  New Movie Recording) using Quicktime Player and when I stopped I accidentally clicked "Don't Save" instead of "Save".  Is that recorded content still on the hard drive somewhere, maybe in a temp or cache folder or something in a hidden directory?  I'd like to recover it.  Thanks.  <answer190714> It appears that you can't recover the file, at least at the level of the Finder. However you may be able to by using recovery software (See below as to where the file is temporarily located).  When a QuickTime recording is started using strongFile : New Movie Recording/strong, the temporary file sits in the folder:  strong~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.savedState//strong  Once the recording is closed, without saving, the file strongwindow_/strong(some unique number)strong.data/strong is automatically deleted. You can see this if you go to the location above, start a recording, and then close without saving.  <answer276604> I was able to recover a recording after QuickTime Player crashed because I disconnected the projector which was in full-screen. I found my recording up until the point of crash in this location: code/Users/AB/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information/Unsaved QuickTime Player Document.qtpxcomposition/code  More info here: https://www.macstories.net/news/recovering-a-lost-quicktime-recording/  <comment226449> Might it be here?: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information/. I didn't see anything in my experiment, but it might be because I didn't leave it going that long. <comment226471> @quip Thanks but nothing there. Useful to know, tho. Any other ideas, please shout. Thanks.
