Mac OSX Mail; how to delay 'Mark as Read' <body> In OSX 10.10 Mail app a message gets read immediately when as soon as it is selected.  Often this happens by accident; i.e. when organising folders, or it gets auto-selected when you delete/move another mail. Suffice to say this behaviour can disturb a workflow.  From other mail clients I'm used you can give it a small offset (few seconds for example) before it is 'Mark as Read'. Does anyone know if OSX has such a setting?  <answer177436> You could do  precodedefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay n /code/pre  Where n = delay in seconds (integer)  <answer211592> Found a solution today at Apple discussions: Mail - how to delay  " Mark as Unread "  User posted "Close the preview pane by dragging it down to the bottom the window.  Double click to open the mail you want to read, the rest will stay unread."    Works with Mail v9.0 under OS X El Capitan 10.11.  <answer228204> Did you quit Mail, do the command, and then restart Mail? I did this and it seems to work intermittently. I did  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail MarkAsReadDelay 3 /code/pre  and for some emails, there is a 1 second delay, and some there is 0. I can't find a pattern. ??!  <answer234751> The Plugins MailHub and Mail Act-On have such options:  h1MailHub/h1     MailHub is a 'smart' plug-in for Apple Mail that revolutionises email management.

However, the last version is for Mac OS X 10.8.  So, if you upgraded to Mavericks or Yosemite, I do not know of a replacement. <comment206839> Thanks, already found that one, but I'm indeed on Yosemite... <comment209845> Note that on Yosemite it's `com.apple.mail` (mail without capital "M"). <comment220947> Does this work for someone ? Just tried it on 10.10.3 and with a delay of 3 secs, but mail is read instantaneously. <comment255748> Thanks for thinking along, this is indeed a way to not automatically select the next (unread) mail, but it is also highly impacting a nice work flow, as every single mail then needs to be opened separately. Not comparable to a simple delay for me. <comment255750> Didn't work for me, although I might retry on El Capitan soon. <comment264635> Doesn't work for me on El Capitan. <comment278206> It's hard to tell if this is an answer or a question/comment.
