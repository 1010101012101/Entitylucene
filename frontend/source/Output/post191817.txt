Crash of User on OS X 10.10.3 and returning to Login Screen <body> On a Mac mini running OS X 10.10.3 with Server 4.1 I have repeatedly have a crash that leads to closing the actual user and returning to the login screen.  Below some logs from the console. The folder code/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/com.apple.preference.notifications.remoteservice_2015-06-16-104014_izar.crash/code that they refer to, is empty.  Is there any idea how to get after the problem?  precode16.06.15 10:40:02,327 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.ReportCrash.Root[9564]) Endpoint has been activated through legacy     launch(3) APIs.
