iPhone update for iPhone 4s from version 5.11 to 8.2 <body> What is the correct file name for iOS 8.2 update file, and which website(other than iTunes) can I download it from?Because direct download from iTunes always fails me.   <comment212304> There are no other legitimate sources for iOS updates. How does the direct download in iTunes fail? You actually should get an prompt for upgrading your iPhone once you plug it into a computer running iTunes. <comment212318> There are sources linking to the Apple DL locations, though. I used to always have to DL directly, as it would then get through in one attempt, whereas the iTunes DL would always fail halfway through & refuse to resume. I've since fixed the issue, it was a firewall problem, however I can still DL a couple of GB directly in a fraction of the time it takes iTunes.
