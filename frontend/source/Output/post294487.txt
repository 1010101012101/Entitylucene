How to move only selected files from one folder to another in Windows 7? <body> I have 1000 images file in one folder. Based on their clarity, I will note down image name and need to move to another folder.  But selecting images one by one using the mouse, based on my selected list, is a tedious process.  Is there any command line code or shortcut to move only the selected images from one to another folder?  <comment371710> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not pertain to Apple software or hardware. <comment371712> Ctrl + A, selects all. Ctrl + X, cuts. Ctrl + V, paste. <comment371717> @jason i need command line code to move selected multiple files at same time ,other than above normal cut copy paste
