Delete dictionaries in iOS <body> Is it possible to delete installed dictionaries (some or all of them) in iOS 9.2?

As you can see from a screenshot, there is not cross button to delete them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iLA6t.jpg" alt="View on dictionary list"  <answer222575> ul liSelect a word in a safari page, then hit define /li liYou will find a strongManage/strong button on the bottom left corner/li liA list with dictionaries will appear you can choose to delete (x symbol) or download new ones (cloud symbol)/li /ul
