What text editor under OS X can close current window when you press ESC key? <body> I'm looking for a text editor that can close the current file when you press codeESC/code key.   I am interested about this for using with a file manager, I open for edit a file and with codeESC/code I want to return to the file commander.  I tried to override the close window command on codeXCode/code but it didn't work, instead of closing the window it does write me an upside down question mark!?  In addition, I tried to assign codeESC/code as shortcut key in System Preferences, but this is not allowed.  <answer10373> Emacs allows you to override shortcuts keys.  Add this line to your em.emacs/em file (located in your home directory) :    precode(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;escape&gt;") 'save-buffers-kill-emacs) /code/pre  <answer10389> Any word processor can be made to close its front window when you hit codeescape/code. Write a little AppleScript, like this:  precodetell application "BBEdit" -- change this to the WP you want     try         close front window     end try end tell /code/pre  Get a copy of 'FastScripts' script menu replacement, and put your script in Library/Scripts/Applications/BBEdit folder. Assign the escape key to the script (in FastScripts preferences).  <comment10868> Thanks, this works, but only with Emacs. Maybe I will try to learn how to use emacs ;) <comment10908> It at my script! <comment10909> --tell application "BBEdit" --try --close front window --end try --end tell --return
