How do I create a keyboard shortcut to go to a specific folder? <body> I have a folder called ~/Documents/Work and I'd like to make the Finder shortcut cmd-shift-W go to that folder, similar to how cmd-shift-H goes to the Home folder (and the equivalent shortcuts for Applications, etc., all under the "Go" menu).  Is it possible to do this? And if so, how can I do it?  <answer59468> Try this AppleScript:  precodetell application "Finder"     activate     set workFolder to (POSIX file "/Users/yourname/Documents/Work") as alias     reveal workFolder end tell /code/pre  For some reason, the tilde doesn't work in the path, so you have to enter your home folder. Since you want to assign that to a shortcut, download FastScripts which enables you to assign shortcuts to AppleScripts.  Hope this helps!  UPDATE:  You can alternatively make an Automator service to run the Applescript.  ol liOpen Automator and select Service/li liOn the left-side menu, select Utilities./li liIn Utilities, drag and drop the "Run Applescript" action into your workflow/li liCopy the applescript above into the "Run Applescript" action/li liSave/li /ol  <comment68493> If you're in another application, do you want the shortcut to open a Finder window to the "Work" directory or do you want the shortcut to only work if you're already in Finder? <comment68507> Off topic for this question; but can't applescripts be made into "Services" that can be hot keyed via sys prefs? <comment68509> @XAleXOwnZX - I think they can through Automator. I'll look into it and get back to you. <comment68510> That's what i was thinking, but idk if Automator has a drag-n'-drop block thingie to implement your own apple script code. I can't check right now b/c i'm not @ home =/ <comment68511> @XAleXOwnZX - I figured out how to do it <comment68512> @XAleXOwnZX - Did that answer your question? <comment68520> oh sweet, it does exist! you didn't mention the process of adding a key bind via sys prefs
