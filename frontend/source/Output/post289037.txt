Good VNC client for Windows 10 to connect to Mac (Sierra) <body> I want to remote access my MacBook Pro running Sierra from my Windows 10 PC. I followed these steps from the Apple site but it does not work. I tried RealVNC and the VNC app for the Chrome browser, but I get a connection timeout error on both applications. Both computers are on the same network and I have tried providing port 5900 with no success. Any idea?  <comment365068> Did you enable screen sharing on your Mac?  See this image:  https://binged.it/2tl9j3y <comment365148> I can't enable Screen sharing if Remote Management is enabled. It's one or the other and I've tried both.
