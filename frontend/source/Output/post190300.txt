How to tell Onedrive to upload photos to a folder instead of the Photos stream on iphone? <body> I have an iPhone 6 - every time I take a photo, it's uploaded to OneDrive, which is great. But the photo lands in the Photos tab in OneDrive, which is different from how WP8.1 worked. I liked how in WP, it would drop the photos in a folder, and then I could go through and move the photos into other folders.  Is there any way to configure onedrive to place the uploaded photos into a folder instead of into the Photos stream?  <comment225892> What do you mean by not in a folder? They are in `Pictures/Camera Roll`. End of story. <comment225949> You're photos just go to the Camera Roll, there are no folders on iOS like there are on Android and WP. You can create seperate albums in Camera Roll though if that's what you're after? <comment228422> They are not in Camera Roll.  There is no Camera Roll folder - I deleted that folder when I got rid of my WP.  If I create "Camera Roll", OneDrive on iPhone then shows the option to see the Camera Roll folder, but the folder stays empty up in onedrive.com and from other devices.  @4ae1e1 <comment228423> @Thibmaekelbergh - commented <comment228455> One thing you could do: go to the web interface (onedrive.live.com) from your PC, go to the "Photos" tab, click on a photo, then click "view folder" (far right of the top bar). Should be able to lead you to where the folder is.
