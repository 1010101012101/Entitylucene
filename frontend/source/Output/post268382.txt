How to turn on "sudo" in OSX 10.12 Sierra <body> When I type "sudo some_command", the terminal shows:  precodesudo: unable to stat /etc/sudoers: Permission denied sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting sudo: unable to initialize policy plugin /code/pre  my account is an admin account, and the /etc/sudoers contains:  precoderoot        ALL = (ALL) ALL %admin      ALL = (ALL) ALL /code/pre  How to fix this?  <answer280230> Open up Terminal and enable root with:  precodedsenableroot -u &lt;your_admin_username&gt; -p &lt;your_password&gt; -r &lt;root_password&gt; #choose some root password here  /code/pre  If the sudoer's is damaged, you still won't be able to codesudo/code - but you will be able to codesu/code and repair the permissions accordingly:  precodesu #when asked afterwards enter the above &lt;root_password&gt; chown root:wheel /etc/sudoers chmod 440 /etc/sudoers chmod -a "admin allow read,write,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextatt‌​r,readsecurity" /etc/sudoers exit /code/pre  Back in your admin account disable root:  precodedsenableroot -d -u &lt;your_admin_username&gt; -p &lt;your_password&gt; /code/pre  hr  In case the above won't help, re-enable root account doing the same as above, logut of your account, login as coderoot/code (yup, really):  Open terminal and type codechmod g+x //code, close the term, logout and tada, sudo is working again :) This problem happens mostly when you mount your code//code through linux in rw mode (for codehfsplus/code in r/w mode use fuse and codebindfs/code)  hr  BTW the emgroup admin/em ACL doesn't seem to harm the sudoers file!  <answer285293> Here is a high-level steps:  precode$ dsenableroot -u &lt;user-username&gt; -p &lt;your-user-password&gt; -r &lt;new-password-for-root&gt; /code/pre  Then create a backup of the sudoers file and edit  precode$ su Password:&lt;your-new-root-password&gt; sh-3.2# cp /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.bak sh-3.2# vi /etc/sudoers.bak sh-3.2# cp /etc/sudoers.bak /etc/sudoers sh-3.2# exit /code/pre  Last disable root access:  precode$ dsenableroot -d -u abdi -p &lt;root-password&gt; dsenableroot:: ***Successfully disabled root user. /code/pre  <comment336922> Please add the output of `ls -l /etc/sudoers` <comment336923> @patrix the output is `-r--r-----+ 1 root  wheel  1563 Jan 11 10:42 /etc/sudoers` <comment336943> Uhh, `ls -le /etc/sudoers` and `ls -led /etc`  as well then, please <comment337054> @patrix `-rw-rw-r--+ 1 root wheel 1563 Jan 11 10:42 /etc/sudoers 0: group:admin allow read,write,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity` and `lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Dec 10 21:13 /etc - private/etc` <comment337179> Did it ever work? The ACL seems a bit strange (I don't have one on this file), but I'm not sure whether this causes any issues (and am reluctanct to try it here). <comment338518> @patrix After reinstalling OSX Sierra, it finally works. I really don't know what's wrong with sudo. <comment352426> Better boot into single user mode for this no need to enable root <comment352429> And do what from the single user login exactly? You need to know how to move around launchctl/diskarbitrioned (since you are in `ro` mount) and doing `mount -rw /` and then `visudo` won't solve this. <comment352440> @mark Might be worth another answer then <comment352446> @PJJ OK I heavily modified your answer ;-) - but after the second dsenableroot line you shouldn't be able to login as root. You either have to run `chmod g+x /` in su mode or you have to move your last sentence in front of the 2nd dsenableroot line. Also: this shouldn't be necessary in Sierra! <comment352447> True, true, overseen that- modded hopefully that won't be all too confusing ;) - most of the times it's `chmod g+x /` since h4x0rs confuse darwin with linux and map happily their guids over darwins realizing later that in darwin guids start from 500 instead of 1000 ;) <comment352449> But the comment section of the **question** is somehow doubtful: Desmond Chen's comment on Jan 11 at 15:40 shows another ls output for the sudoers file than Desmond Chen's comment on Jan 12 at 1:29! The "first" sudoers file should work. <comment352450> yeah, the one listed on 12th is wrong, should be `chmod 440` and is 644 o.O instead <comment352454> 2c tip: use `visudo` for editing sudoers.
