Is there a notepad that lets me change the background image? <body> I want to put this blackboard as the background of my notepad, so when I type, it'll look like I'm writing on a blackboard.  Do you know a simple text editor that will let me use it as a background image?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wLSu3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer35195> WriteRoom is a pretty awesome text editor in general, and will let you do this through its built in custom themes feature.  <answer35201> FocusWriter is another text editor that will allow you to do this, and it is free.  However, it does not have as good of a design as WriteRoom does.
