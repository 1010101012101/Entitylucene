Trouble with local iCloud services <body> I reset my password for iCloud recently and everything went pretty smoothly. My mac still connects to iCloud and the password to log in has also been changed. However whenever I restart my computer, all of the different iCloud services request my password again, and only accept my old password. There are about 10 pop- up boxes, here are some of them:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j41iO.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rqZsR.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I notify these services that the password has been changed so that I do not have to go through this process every time I restart my machine?  (As a side note, I know that my mac connects to iCloud because iCloud Drive does update when I add folder to the iCloud Drive folder on my mac.)  Thanks.  <answer198577> I called Apple tech support today and got the following answer. It seems to be working so far.  ol liNavigate to the codeLibrary/code folder (The easiest way is to go to the codeFinder/code top menu bar, hold down codeOption/code on the codeGo/code submenu and you should see it come up)/li liDelete the codeKeychains/code folder/li liGo to iCloud in codePreferences/code and sign back in/li /ol  Hope this helps!
