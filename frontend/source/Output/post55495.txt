Facebook deleted email addresses from Contacts, how to restore? <body> Most of my contacts that I'm also connected with on Facebook, no longer have any email address in Contacts. Sigh!  The problem is described here:br http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=13197  I have a backup in iTunes, but I dunno if it's after the incident occurred. Then I would have to merge it into Contacts, but it seems like a tricky operation.  I can also go through all my sent/received emails in gmail and copy/paste the addresses from there into Contacts, but it seems very time consuming and may not be a full restoration.  If I restore the addresses, will Facebook then delete addresses again. Should I wait restoring until there is a new Facebook app where the problem has been fixed?  How to restore the deleted email addresses?  <comment63707> Facebook has commented that this is a bug they intend to fix. If you can afford the time, you could be patient for a fix from their side. <comment63721> @Gerry Only if they allow access to the "original" e-mail addresses again. Because the fix for the device will be a simple resync with facebook.
