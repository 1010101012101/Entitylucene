Purpose of groups & subgroup feature, in iOS contacts? <body> I have searched and to my surprise I can't seem to locate the answer to this what I thought would be common everyday problem.  Can someone please explain to me what the purpose of the "groups" feature is for the iOS contacts?    Under the "groups" menu there are several accounts.  Depending on the type of account there can be one or more ways to access the account:  ol liThe "Contacts" option which selects the account you you to view the users in it. This is standard for every account and is the only option I personally understand because it's self explanitory./li liThe "global address list" feature which to me seems absolutely useless. It seems to only appear under "exchange" accounts. I have never been able to successfully pull anything up with this feature and don't understand its purpose. Please explain./li liMultiple sub-groups within my iCloud account of which I have no control over. I cannot edit these subgroups or delete these subgroups or add to these subgroups. Furthermore I cannot even view who is assigned these subgroups on the contact itself rendering the "feature" absolutely useless.  The only way you can find out who is assigned to which subgroup is by selecting that particular subgroup and deselecting all of the other accounts and subsequent subgroups - a terribly inefficient method./li /ol  These icloud subgroups are named as follows:  ul liAquaintances /li liBuusiness /li liFamily/li liFavorites/li liFriends/li liFriends/li liFun/li liFun/li liHot Contacts/li liImported 9/12/12/li liInternet/li liPersonal/li liPersonal/li liSchool/li liService/li liWork/li /ul  Those dups are not typos.   What is the purpose of these useless sub-groups? Where are they managed? And lastly can I just do away with all of them and group all my contacts under the same group and same account and lose all these double and triple linked contacts?
