Getting high ping when MacBook Air is connected to Wi-Fi <body> I have a 13" MacBook Air with Yosemite 10.10.2 installed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CCVHr.png" alt="screen-shot"  As soon as I connect it to my WiFi, I get a very high ping (1600 ms) on both my machines: Windows 7 PC and my MacBook. As a result browsing becomes very difficult. I ping 8.8.8.8!  But if I disconnect my MacBook ping becomes normal (70-80 ms) on Windows PC. I've checked ping by disconnecting my PC, restarted my modem-router, switched off Bluetooth on my Mac.   I've a modem + router D-Link 2750u on the ground floor wired to TP Link 740N on the first floor. I've tried connecting only to 2750u also by switching off 740N. I've been using this setup for last 4-5 months, but the issue has started since couple of weeks back.   What else I've tried:  ol liSetting DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4/li liDeleting cache.db file from com.apple.safari /li liBooted in safe mode and restarted back. emIn safe boot mode I get the usual ping of 70-80 ms/em but after restarting and booting in normal mode the ping returns back to 1600 ms./li /ol  How do I solve this issue?  <comment271369> Please add some ping (`ping -c 3 ip-address`) results to your question: Mac - PC, Mac - Router1/2, Mac - 8.8.8.8, PC - Router1/2, PC - Router1/2 (without the MBA in the network) <comment271581> The ping has returned to normal. I don't know how. But since today morning I'm getting a normal ping.  3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 66.880/67.390/67.850/0.398 ms.  I still don't know the problem. <comment273856> I've replaced my TP Link 740N with D-Link AC750 and have been using 5 GHz frequency only for my Macbook and iPad.  I'm attaching (ping -c 3 8.8.8.8) results.  --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 2198.529/2221.333/2251.944/22.494 ms <comment273945> OK I think I've understood the issue. Every time I sync my photos from my iPhone to my macbook using iPhotos, it tries to upload the pics on to my "photo stream". I synced my photos on 30.01.2015 around 6 PM and since then the ping has been high. The moment I disabled the photo stream option ping returned back to normal.  I'm not sure why this is happening (if indeed it was the reason).  How do I make sure? <comment273950> You may install a network monitor (e.g. Little Snitch). LS is a packet filter (~firewall) but also contains a network monitor (via the menubar). The filter stops working after 3 hours in the trial version - but you may completely disable the filter and only use the monitor. AFAIR the monitor stops working after 14 days in the trial - but that should be enough to hunt down the problem
