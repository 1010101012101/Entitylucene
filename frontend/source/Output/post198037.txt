How do I get the actual ip address of a printer in OSX Yosemite <body> I need to know the ip address of my printer from OSX to be able to configure it in my daughters Windows laptop. I tried the solution suggested in How do you get a printer&#39;s IP in lion? but I only get: emdnssd://AL-CX11-08F61E._printer._tcp.local./auto/em, and I cannot ping AL-CX11-08F61E._printer._tcp.local. because it does not resolve. Still, I can print. How do I get the actual IP address?  Edit: why doesn't it resolve from the commandline, but still OSX can print?  <answer198057> All modern networkable printers (which have a display) have an option to set and display the IP address. Often times you hold the "go button" down for 15 seconds, or while powering up the printer. Sometimes you need a utility that goes with the printer to set and/or view it. Check your manual or find one online.  <answer198066> There is a tool Bonjour Browser which will show you the connected devices on the current network.  The connection types are sorted, and you can usually find the printers in strongPrint Spooler (_printer._tcp.)/strong or strongInternet Printing Protocol (_ipp._tcp.)/strong sections.  Each device will list its IP address, among other information.  <answer244547> You should be able to  precode ping -c 1  AL-CX11-08F61E.local. | grep PING /code/pre  (strongemNOT/em/strong codeping AL-CX11-08F61E._printer._tcp.local./code).  The line you see then should reveal the IP address of the printer.  <answer266432> Use http://localhost:631/printers/ to see the list of printers available. The page shows both printer model and its IP/name under the Printers tab. To enable the cups page, run codecupsctl WebInterface=yes/code in terminal.  <comment236886> Is the printer actually on the network, or is it connected directly to your Mac? <comment236903> This is correct, but does not answer the question. I want to get it from OSX, not from the printer. <comment236904> The printer is on the network, not directly connected. <comment236905> Is the IP address of your printer defined manually or through DHCP? If its IP address is dynamically attributed through DHCP, you won't have a stable configuration on Windows if you use an IP address. The correct method starts by defining a name and a static IP address to your printer on your router (ex.: `snow-white  192.168.1.128`). Then you will be able to configure it from MacOS X and Windows with its network name (ex.: `snow-white.local`). <comment236906> Please clarify your comment nÂ°2: how is your printer accessing the network? Add this info at the beginning of your question: this is a key detail. <comment236911> Is it awake? Mine doesn't respond to arp or nmap if it's asleep, though it will wake & print if it's an already-known device for that machine. <comment236912> so you do not actually want to know the IP, you want to know how to get it within the OS X. <comment236913> The printer is likely added in via Bonjour/policy, which would use a different name than the IP. Try the following: 1) Launch Network Utility (can be accessed via Spotlight, magnifying glass in upper-right or Space+Command). 2) Go to Lookup in NU. 3) Enter the following address: AL-CX11-08F61E.local 4) Click Lookup and see if you receive a response. If this works, I'll post it as an answer below. The system does an IP lookup based on the printers' name across the network and should return its IP. <comment236955> Thanks. This tool indeed shows the ip address as well as other useful info. <comment236956> @smoooosher: I accepted the answer given by Kent, but your answer also provided valuable information: the fact that you can ping the printer by removing _printer._tcp from the hostname. Thank you for that. <comment236957> I don't know why my question was downvoted? It did show research effort, and how my printer is accessing the network was implied in the question. Why would I need to find the ip address if it is directly connected?
