error code -1407 Mac OS X 10.6.7 <body> Out of the blue, I can't send any files to the trash bin. "The operation can't be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -1407)  Any ideas for me?  <answer13505> You might want to try repairing file permissions with Disk Utility.  <answer13551> emFinder/em’s trash can is an amalgam of several different directories:  ul licode~/.Trash//code/li licode/.Trashes/&lt;uid&gt;//code on each volume (including the startup volume)br e.g. code/Volumes/Big Media Volume/.Trashes/501//code/li /ul  Most trash operations will move the trashed item to the directory under your home directory. If you trash something on an separate volume, however, emFinder/em will move the item into the volume’s code/.Trashes/&lt;uid&gt;//code directory instead (because moving a file to a location on the same volume is very fast, but copying a file from some other volume to your home directory’s trash directory could be quite slow).  Try checking your main trash directory (in a emTerminal/em window):  precodels -ld ~/.Trash /code/pre  If the result does not look like start with codedrwx------/code and show your user’s “short name” twice (the second is actually a group name), then your personal trash directory has probably been fouled. You can move it aside then logout and login again:  precodecd ~ &amp;&amp; mv .Trash .Trash.old # now logout and re-login /code/pre  This should create a new code~/.Trash/code directory for you. You may want to investigate the contents of the code.Trash.old/code file/directory to try to determine its origin.  If the problem is with a per-volume trash directory, you should be able to use the same idea: move it aside, eject it, then remount it (disconnect and reconnect an external disk, reopen a disk image, use emDisk Utility/em to remount an internal volume):  precodecd '/Volume/whereever' &amp;&amp; mv .Trashes .Trashes.old # then eject and remount /code/pre  You may need code… &amp;&amp; sudo mv …/code if the volume has “Owners Enabled”.  <answer92512> You can resolve Mac Error Code 1407 by going through the solutions given in the tutorial link below:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly4KN170-ds  <answer93154> You can resolve Mac Error Code 1407, here are solutions:  Reboot your system:  Click Apple Menu button You will have an option of Restart, click the option A dialog box will appear  Click for confirmation  Now click Yes for Reboot  You are done!
