Net-SNMP python binding path <body> I'm currently setting a development environment in python 3.3 and i'm trying to import the Net-SNMP python bindings but idk where the files are located.  Simple question: anyone knows where are located the Net-SNMP python binding files in MacOSX 10.8.3??  <answer91368> The python bindings for Net-SNMP are not built by default (Net-SNMP docs) and are not part of the default install on OSX.  The can be installed from the Net-SNMP source code or via package managers such as macports.  <comment107293> I think you need to install them <comment107294> @Mark well MacOSX comes with Net-SNMP pre-installed, then i need to download sources compile and install manually ? <comment107295> Yes see [this blog](https://stomp.colorado.edu/blog/blog/2011/06/06/on-net-snmp-and-python/) <comment107316> only a comment. Mac ports doesn't have the Python Binding package. i used Mac Ports to install the most recent version of net-SNMP and downloaded the tar.gz from the official page and built manually the binding (both Macport Package and the Tarball are the same versions) <comment107334> Try the py27-snmp port
