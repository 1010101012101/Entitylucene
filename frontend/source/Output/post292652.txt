Remove Burst UUID <body> I want to easily remove all exif tags "Burst UUID" from a batch of photos.  emSnipped from this link: "All the photos that are taken in a burst sequence share a "BurstUUID" in their EXIF data"/em  I have tried opening the .jpgs with Preview (Mac OS) and "Photos Exif Editor" (Mac App Store) but neither show "Burst UUID".  <answer292660> You will be able to do this with ExifTool , check read the docs concerning code-BurstUUID/code  <comment369316> I have 2'600+ Bursts in my "Photos app". Most of them are in an album - should not lose their placement. My goal is to just "strip" all bursts so that all photos are shown individually. Do you think I can just let "ExifTool" run my "PhotosLibrary" folder and remove every single "BurstUUID" from all .jpg it finds?
