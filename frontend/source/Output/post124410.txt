It is possible to create a login which doesn't need a password <body> I was thinking that assigning passwords to OS X accounts is mandatory and you had to set the account to auto-login to avoid having to enter it every time. But can I also define a user account which doesn't need a password?  <answer124411> You do not have to set a password:  ul liStart with Create new user account in System preferences - Users &amp; Groups/li liUnder drop down choose for example Standard Account/li liEnter name and account but skip the password filed/li liYou will get a warning about not having password, click OK/li /ul  Account is now created without password.  The Guest account (if enabled) also doesn't require a password.  <comment145514> Thank you, but you can connect via ssh only to admin account, and password is required in this case? <comment145539> Actually you *can* set a blank password for an "Admin" account. <comment145743> @TonyWilliams How can I do that. 1) When I try to create new account on Mavericks from "System Preferences" - "Users & Groups" and I left blank password, I got "Name cannot be empty". 2) When I tried change later this password by terminal "sudo passwd ..." I also couldn't leave blank password. <comment145918> I can only assume that you left the "Full Name" field empty. You have to fill in the "Full Name" and "Account name" fields but leave the passwords empty.
