Will Migration assistant erase my Lion setup <body> I just got a new macbook pro. It runs Lion.  I have a time machine backups of my old snow leopard machine. If I use Migration assistant to move data to new machine via time machine backup, will it erase my Lion OS? I need Lion but I need old data.  <answer25874> No, you'll be fine. Migration assistant migrates user accounts, applications, setting and/or files (depending on what options you choose), but it won't overwrite your Lion operating system. See Apple's guide to using Migration Assistant here.  <comment29412> No, what good would migrating files from another drive or windows machine be if it moved the OS as well? <comment29421> I hope that comparing a person to a goose is not interpreted as a grave insult to a person in India. (This is my attempt at humor.)
