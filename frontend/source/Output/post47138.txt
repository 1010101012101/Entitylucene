How do I stop my computer from crashing? <body> Recently, I've been having problems with my late 2009 MacBook Pro crashing several times a day. How can I fix it?  I'm running OS 10.7.3 with 8 GB of RAM.  <answer47139> This is a setting that Apple has for some reason decided to hide completely, and can easily be fixed with a few simple steps.  ol liFirst, go to /System/Library/CoreServices/ and right-click on Finder. Select Show Package Contents, navigate to …/Contents/Info.plist and open it in TextEdit./li liNear the bottom, below the last code&lt;/array&gt;/code but before the last code&lt;/dict&gt;/code, add the following two lines of code: code&lt;key&gt;ShowCrashPrefs&lt;/key&gt;/code code&lt;true/&gt;/code/li liSave and quit TextEdit. Hold kbdctrl/kbd+kbdopt/kbd while clicking on the Finder icon and select Relaunch. Once Finder fully loads again, advance to step 4./li liOpen Finder preferences with Finder  Preferences… or kbd⌘/kbd+kbd,/kbd and navigate to the Advanced tab. Tick the "Show crash prefpane in System Preferences" option. img src="https://i.imgur.com/it2KP.png" alt="Finder Prefs"/li liLaunch System preferences and select the new Crash icon, under strongSystem/strong. When it loads, drag the crash frequency slider to Min./li /ol  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pyeyh.png" alt="System Prefs"  <comment53987> Here’s a one-liner that you can use in Terminal.app instead of step 1 and 2: `defaults write NSGlobalDomain ShowCrashPrefs -bool true`. It should be noted that on pre-Lion OS X versions, the “Max” label says “Windows mode” instead. <comment53988> @MathiasBynens Good catch! <comment53995> 13-inch or 15-inch? <comment53997> 15 inches diagonally. <comment54007> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29426/help-my-computer-doesnt-work <comment54008> Which diagonal? If they're not both 15" your screen may be a parallelogram <comment54063> @KyleCronin Hadn't thought about that! I just checked and the top-left-to-bottom-right diagonal is exactly 17" but the bottom-left-to-top-right diagonal is 16.996"! (Apparently I was wrong about the 15 inches.) I have been cheated of—(hang on, let me do the math) <comment54064> @KyleCronin My math just proved I'm an idiot. I still have the same number of pixels, but my screen's a bit lopsided. <comment54078> What happens if Crash frequency is set for a negative value?
