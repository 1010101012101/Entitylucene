Applescript opens new window for everything when run <body> I have the following code I did for a tweetbot keyboard shortcut to open tweetbot and create a new tweet.  precodeon run {input, parameters}     activate application "Tweetbot 2"         tell application "System Events" to keystroke "n" using command down     return input end run /code/pre  However, it always opens a new window for anything that is run in the background as well. This only happens when Tweetbot is not already running.   How can I fix this ?  <answer70591> This is because the application is not in the foreground.  The codeactivate/code command will not wait the response of the application when the application is not scriptable. So the script executes immediately the codekeystroke/code command, therefore the codekeystroke/code will be intercepted by another application.   precodeactivate application "Tweetbot 2" tell application "System Events"   tell process "Tweetbot 2"       repeat until exists           delay 0.4       end repeat       set frontmost to true       delay 0.2       keystroke "n" using command down   end tell end tell /code/pre   <comment81947> It opens a new window of what? AppleScript Editor, Tweetbot? <comment81948> Whatever is already running .. Opens a new applescript editor if automator is being used, opens a new safari window if safari is being used etc <comment81970> Thank you @jackjr300 , but the code just runs infinitely and does not stop ... it puts tweetbot as the foreground but doesnt really prompt a new tweet ! Can you please explain the commands you have used ?? Im trying to learn how to script using automator <comment82153> This is because the process name is not the same as the application. I don't know any Mac OS X application named "**Tweetbot 2**".  The name is "**Tweetbot**" on Mac App Store.   Check the name of your process with this script: `tell application "System Events" to name of processes`, execute it in the editor, look at the result. ---explanation of the commands: wait until the process exists, put the process to foreground, execute the keystroke.
