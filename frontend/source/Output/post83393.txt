Delete Key on Apple KeyBoard Deleting only 1 char at a time <body> I used to delete characters continuously by pressing my delete key on apple keyboard but for some reason now I can not do it. I have to release and press again to delete the previous character.  For example:  If I have a line like "This is a text to delete". In the past, I will just place my cursor at the end of the sentence.. e.g after delete and keep pressing delete key until the entire sentence is removed. Now, I have press the delete key and release for every character.  I have set keyboard setting to default but still see the same issue.  Any ideas?  Thanks, Rj  <answer83464> This might be a setting in your keyboard system preferences panel.  Try adjusting your Key Repeat setting as shown: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGIL0.png" alt="Keyboard system preferences screenshot"  <answer182328> Reducing the Delay Until Repeat to short will also reduce the wait before the cursor starts moving.  Alternative Method: Holding down the option key while hitting delete enables you to delete a word at each press (except for punctuation).   <answer255561> go to settings.  click on keyboard icon.  under on screen key board, look for filter keys and turn it off.    <answer277906> Go to settings - keyboard - key repeat, change to fast - delay until repeat, change to short. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2M1Jr.png" alt="this is how it should look for fastest results"  <comment96018> Are other keys like the arrow keys repeated? <comment96103> thanks I've been wondering about this for a few past os's <comment302726> Thanks. This helped me. It allowed me to delete at least one word at a time. Before it would only delete a letter at a time. Delete key used to delete an entire sentence but something went wrong. Deleting one word at a time really helps. <comment309110> After update to Sierra, even though my sliders above were set correctly, key repeating wouldn't work. For me, it was enough to just move them a little and then move back. <comment318354> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.
