Why does my mouse cursor stick as the default arrow instead of a text selector? <body> I use NetBeans, and when I activate other applications or windows then return to NetBeans, the cursor no longer changes to the text selection cursor, but instead it remains as the default mouse icon. I can solve the problem by hovering over the application toolbar, then go back to the editor area.  I have this problem in another IDE, phpstorm, it also happens occasionally in Chrome. TextMate and TextEdit do not have this problem.  Why is this happening? How can I fix it so I don't have to keep moving the cursor outside of the editor constantly?  For further explanation, please pay attention to the mouse cursor in a video I made showing the problem.  <answer28631> I have had this problem in Snow Leopard with the cursor not changing from a beach ball (a frozen beach ball, not a spinning one) to a normal cursor. What Iâ€™ve done to fix this is mouseover the dock resizing point (see picture below). Hope this helps!  img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUoxV.png" alt="dockresizing point"  <answer267033> Try editing the NetBeans source code. I'm not an expert on Java GUIs, but there should be a codesetCursor()/code function you can put into codeonHover/code or something like that. Check the documentation of the GUI toolkit NetBeans uses.  (@tubedogg, Chrome doesn't use a native GUI. Although it tries its best to use the OS look, the title bar is custom, which you can't do with Apple's native GUI toolkit.)  <comment32967> I've tried, but it didnt unfortunately :( <comment36387> He already has a workaround, that's to move it into the Application's toolbar. Having a workaround is not the point of the question, he wants a fix. <comment54739> @daviesgeek Your image seems to have disappeared from wherever it's hosted. Do you still have a copy you can move somewhere new? <comment54744> @CajunLuke There you go! <comment54747> @daviesgeek Thanks. I just happened to see it was missing and I figured you'd be around to fix it. <comment54750> @CajunLuke Yah. It was odd. I didn't actually do anything. I clicked "edit" and loaded the URL and the picture just suddenly appeared. It was odd... <comment54754> @daviesgeek The server must have been waiting on activity or something. I wondered how you'd fixed it without editing the question. <comment180383> I have the same problem. I also made a video of the behaviour. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmj33QVYFY0&feature=youtu.be <comment189535> Also happening here. Weird that Apple has never fixed this. <comment312457> Pretty big assumption that it's Apple somehow causing this, given that it doesn't happen in some applications. I'm guessing it depends on something in how the application is programmed. I was originally thinking non-native apps (since NetBeans is a Java app), although Chrome is definitely a native app.
