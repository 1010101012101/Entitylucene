Auto Join networks on Os X Lion - auto fill password problem <body> When I connect to my Uni's networks (which require me to enter my username and password) Os X Lion displays an "auto-join" window looking like this:  auto-join mask http://f.cl.ly/items/2r3n1z2j3e1o190p0P3E/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-25%20at%2009.43.02.png Unfortunately auto fill appears not to work in this mask!   To compare see same form in Safari autofill in safari http://f.cl.ly/items/2u2G0h1c2x2c0c350o2f/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-25%20at%2009.43.24.png  Retyping username/password at every login is quite annoying. Is there a way to make auto fill work in the 'auto-join' window or are there other ways to avoid this?  <comment352970> Your links are broken. If you still have the image or remember what it was and can take it again, can you reupload it using the official image uploader?
