How to have terminal close tab when shell exits? <body> I just recently upgraded from 10.6 to 10.8. On 10.6 I could set the terminal to close the tab/window when the shell exits.  Mountain Lion's terminal just says the process is completed and the tab/window stays open:  precodebash$ exit logout  [Process completed] /code/pre  I find this very annoying, but I no longer see the preference to change it. Is there a way to set Mountain Lion's Terminal to close when its process exits?  <answer60200> You can change this in Terminal's Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4EToJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment69331> aha! thank you!
