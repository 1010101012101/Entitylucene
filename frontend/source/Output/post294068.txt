Cydia WiFi Hotspot for SSH Without SIM Card <body> I have recently jailbroken an old iPhone 4 I have and have been having a great experience with it as a device to fiddle with, however I need to be able to use it in areas where there isn't any WiFi over SSH.  Is there any tweak installable which will allow me to toggle the phone to make a WiFi Hotspot. The phone will not have a SIM Card installed to I don't care about mobile data. I simply want to connect to the phone's WiFi hotspot and SSH into its console via my iPad.  Thanks for any responses.  <answer294396> A tweak named Polus allows changing Control Center toggle switches and has a switch for hotspot. Though you might be on a too low iOS version and not have a CC. In that case try SBSettings(iOS 6 and lower), but you will have to search and install desired toggles manually.   <answer294963> I don't know of a package that will let you SSH from a hotspot coming from the phone, but I think you would have an easier time starting a hotspot on your iPad connecting the phone to the hotspot &amp; SSHing from there.  <comment371670> Doesn't seem to work with a toggle, and i'm not willing to spend money on something not certain to work. Thanks for suggesting anyway :D <comment372264> As far as I can tell, I can only start a hotspot on a 3G enabled iPad, which I do not have. My iPad isn't jail broken, as it is brand new, and the whole point of the phone was to be an old, jail broken device. Am I missing something on the iPad? <comment373079> Ah I didn't realize this. This should be possible but it's such a niche use case (creating a wifi network not connected to the Internet for the purpose of SSHing) that I'm not sure that you'll find an application that does what you want.
