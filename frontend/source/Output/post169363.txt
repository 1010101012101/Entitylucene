How to uninstall an app on iOS <body> Of course, by holding down on an icon and tap the kbdx/kbd lets me uninstall an app. But take a look at this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vNPhW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Here, the Pandora app is somehow stuck at the "update phase". Tapping it to continue download doesn't work. The progress "circle" will get stuck. So I decided to reinstall it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mxnUg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"     Translation:br   strongDelete “”/strongbr   Deleting “” will also delete all its data.   For some reason it doesn't even show the name of the app. It's just blank.  Tapping kbddelete/kbd does nothing. So what do I have to do to fix this problem?  Running iOS 8, not jail broken.  <answer169422> Derek. Not a lot of people realize that an iPhone is a computer and should be treated as such. Just like your computer you shut it down or at least restart it on a regular basis. People don't do this with iPhones, because well, it's a phone and they may 'miss a call' or it's just habit for most. It causes a lot of memory leaks especially if developers aren't skilled enough to know how to test within their apps for memory leaks. In other words, a soft restart (turning it off in the normal manner by holding the sleep button and sliding to power off and then turning it back on) will 99% of the time autonomously repair itself and reset the memory. The 1% chance it does not you can do a hard restart (holding the sleep and home button simultaneously for 4-5 sec) will fix your issue.   <comment198902> Have You tried removing this from iTunes? <comment198905> @MateuszSzlosek I was going to try that, but is this normal..? See [this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/43WD9.gif). The gray part is the remaining memory, and from the original 1GB left, it says there will be 19GB remaining afterward. <comment198994> I tried both way of turning off but the problem persists. <comment199057> @Derek朕會功夫 you should consider a restore or just delete contents and settings? If you are using two different App Store (US and Europes) for example this could be the issue <comment199083> I only have used the US App Store, but I'll try clearing the settings and data and see if it fixes the problem. <comment213591> How much memory do you have on the iPhone?  Could it be that it's trying to install the app, but can't because of memory requirements?  Just a stab in the dark here, but thought I'd put my 2c in :D <comment213707> @N.Soong I had more than enough memory for it to do it stuff I'm sure. But you are right on one thing that this indeed happened when I was updating the app. Anyway, I tried a lot of way to remove it including removing in iTunes but no luck. And then the 8.2 update came and once I updated it's gone. Guess for some reason the update fixed it.
