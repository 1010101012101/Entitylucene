Find files modified today, using command line (bash) <body> As we all know, despite being named "Finder", the Finder is virtually useless at finding files.   In Mac OS X 10.6 (or any version), how can I use the command line (bash in Terminal) to find files modified today?  <answer117412> There are several ways to do this in bash from the terminal - depending on exactly what you want to find:  Find files modified in the last 24 hours  precodefind / -mtime -1 -print /code/pre  Find files modified today (likely what you want)  precodefind / -newerct 'yesterday' -print /code/pre  or, using Spotlight  precodemdfind date:today /code/pre  This can also be done from the GUI with Spotlight.  ol liOpen Spotlight (option-command space by default)./li liAdd a criteria to search for, by hitting the Plus sign near the top right of the Spotlight window./li liChange the criteria to "Last modified date" is "today."/li /ol  <comment137205> Note that you don't need the `-print` at the end since `find` defaults to it and in most cases you want to replace the `/` with either `.` to find down from the current directory or `~` to find in your home directory rather than the top of the tree. <comment366858> possible to check files modifies in last 5 minutes or last 2 hours? <comment374311> @Ewoks Yes, `mtime` defaults to using days, but if you specify units, can find modifications from last n seconds, minutes, hours, or weeks, e.g.:      `find . -mtime -5m` -or-     `find . -mtime -2h`
