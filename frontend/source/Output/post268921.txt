Automator's "Extract to PDF" does not remember output folder <body> I'm trying to create a simple codeFolder Action/code with codeAutomator/code (on macOS Sierra 10.12.2) that watches a folder for codePDF/code files and convert these to codeTXT/code files and save it to a subfolder. The problem is that the selected subfolder is not being stored. When I hit save and open the action again, the subfolder is set to its default codeDesktop/code.  This is how it looks like when I hit codesave/code. When I close Automator, open it again and select this recent action, codeSave Output to/code is set to codeDesktop/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rflkm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268922> Seems to be a known bug that hasn't been resolved since 2012:  How to extract the text of a PDF document with Automator, and save it in a directory
