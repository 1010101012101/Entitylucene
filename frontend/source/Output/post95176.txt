Can I change the locale for a single application? <body> Is it possible to change the locale on a per-application basis in OS X 10.8? Background: I'd like to play "Larry Reloaded" in English, but my user locale is German. The game detects this, and switches to German voices and texts. I don't want to create a new user just for the game, nor do I want to switch the locale manually when starting the game, and back again after quitting.   <answer95190> Here is an update for you hopefully you will still enjoy the game :)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fStHa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that the game won’t allow the player to select the desired language - until a patch is released, you’ll have to fix that by strongchanging your system settings/strong.  <answer95191> You can add an AppleLanguages array to the plist of an application:  precodedefaults write -app Calculator AppleLanguages -array de /code/pre  See codedefaults read -g AppleLanguages/code for the language identifiers.  Language Switcher is a GUI for doing the same thing.  <comment111639> Are you using Steam -German account ? <comment111649> Using the DRM free version from their website. <comment111653> Seems like what I need. I will try it out later.
