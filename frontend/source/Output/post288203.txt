iPhone 7 stuck in recovery mode <body> My iPhone 7 is stuck in recovery mode after downgrading from IOS 11 beta public version.  After spending hours on the phone with Apple, they told me that I either have to ship it in or take it to an Apple Store.  Does anyone have a fix, that will save me a 45 minute trip?
