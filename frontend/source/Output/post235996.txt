How can I use a command to delete all files in Downloads whose dates added are greater than 1 year? <body> I am using a Mac. How can I use a command to delete all files in code~/Downloads/code whose dates added are greater than 1 year?  <answer236001> It's a relatively simple command to delete files within a directory greater than one year.  For instance, the following command executed in Terminal  codefind ~/Downloads/ -type f -mtime +365 -exec rm {} \;/code  will delete all files in the code~/Downloads/code directory older than one year.  ul licodefind/code is the command that searches for "stuff"/li licode-type f/code tells find what to look for, in this case emfiles/em/li licode-mtime +365/code tells find that the modified time should be greater than 365 days/li licode-exec rm {}/code passes (executes) each "found" item to the command coderm/code/li /ul  What I like to do is test it out by excluding the code-exec rm {} \;/code portion and make sure I am getting the correct results.  Once I am certain, I just add it in to complete the remove.  strongOne Caveat!!  These files are not added to your "Trash."  The command  bypasses the Trash and are immediately deleted, so use with caution./strong  hr strongA Safer Way.../strong  (Thanks to user emlucasoldaini/em in the comments below)  If you want to move your files to the "Trash" simply replace the code-exec rm {} \;/code portion to code-exec mv {} ~/.Trash \;/code  They will remain in your Trash until the next time you empty it.  You can get more information on each command by viewing their man pages:   ul licodeman find/code/li licodeman exec/code/li /ul  <answer236003> If you want to use Automator you can build an action like so:  Find Finder Items  - Search Downloads  - All of the following are true:    -Date Created is not in the last 365 days.  Get Selected Finder Items  Move Finder Items to Trash  Convenient Screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Orxxc.png" alt="Automator Actions"  <answer236008> My choice of tool is Hazel, a low cost multipurpose piece of software that does things to files and folders when they match certain rules that you set up. This rule will move files not added the last year from the folder emHÃ¤mtade filer/em. In differs from the command line solution above as it runs every day, so its a set and forget solution. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eAIH4.png" alt="Screenshot of Hazel pref pane"  <comment288686> Are you specifically looking for a terminal command, or would something like an automator action suffice? <comment288687> What do you mean by "whose dates are added?"  Added to what and how? <comment288713> Instead of using `rm`, you could move the files to `~/.Trash` to prevent them for being immediately deleted. <comment288717> Note that **date modified** (which this answer is operating on) is different than **date added**. Furthermore, Safari will set the modification date of a downloaded file to the one [provided by the server](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.2) if available, so even a file downloaded yesterday can have a modification date more than a year old. <comment288718> @Allan Check "View  Arrange By" or the columns available in "View Options" in the Finder; OS X tracks the date an item was added to a folder. <comment288719> If you have homebrew: *brew install trash* and instead rm use trash command from now on. <comment288784> @Miles -  those attributes aren't available in bash unless you install XCode Dev tools and the OP specifically used ~/Downloads which is a bash (or more generically, a shell) convention. <comment288791> I updated my answer based on the suggestion by @lucasoldaini I prefer to use built in methods rather than use homebrew or MacPorts. <comment288917> I like your solution more than mine. <comment292620> This is the best solution, as it actually uses Date Added rather than Date Modified, which may not be the same. A command-line solution could look for `kMDItemDateAdded` in `mdls` but I highly recommend the Hazel solution instead.
