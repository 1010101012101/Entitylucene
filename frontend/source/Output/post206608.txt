Time Machine not doing incremental backups any more after unmounting one of my disks once <body> I have a problem with my Time Machine backups. I have two harddrives in my MBP and I unmonted my spinning harddrive once bc I was studying and it was getting annoying. As I knew I would need no files from my 'data partition' I resumed with only my SSD. When I mounted the harddrive again everything was working as before.  But since then my Time Machine is acting up. Whenever I want to backup it says that I dont have enough space and it would require ~660GB of additional space for the backup which accounts for my total amount of backuped data. I only have a 1TB backup volume, but that's more than enough space usually, so I think it is not doing incremental backups anymore.  My hardrive layout consist of my system disk codeMacintosh SSD/code and my data disk codeMacintosh HDD/code.  I tried to use tmutil to fix some things. I tried  precodesudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/MacBook\ Pro/ /code/pre  and  precodesudo tmutil associatedisk -a /Volumes/Macintosh\ HDD  /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/MacBook\ Pro/2015-09-09-134637/Macintosh\ HDD /code/pre  but it didnt change anything. Also when runing tmutil compare it would only show a difference of 8.3GB (last bit of output: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=NhmZkfM6) instead of the reported 660GB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBgKR.jpg" alt=""  The only reason to move on would be to delete my current backup and start a completely new one, which I don't really want to do as it is my only full backup on the harddrive.  What advice do you have from here?
