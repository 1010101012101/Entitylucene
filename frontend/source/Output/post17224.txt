Jump to the Terminal's right directory from Finder's specific directory <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   &ldquo;open terminal here&rdquo;?       If I browse my Apple Finder at  precode/Users/arie/Documents/shugyou/genjutsu/fp /code/pre  How can I possibly go to strongTerminal/strong with that very same directory? So that I won't need to do two less productive commands (1) open Terminal from Spotlight, and then (2) type codecd /Users/arie/Documents/shugyou/genjutsu/fp/code.   I use Mac OS X 10.5.8. Note I don't (want to) use iTerm. TIA.  <answer17225> cdto - Finder Toolbar button to open a Terminal window  cdff - Switch Terminal dir to frontmost window of certain apps   <answer17228> You should give that application a try. It works on 10.6 as well as on 10.5 ;-)  Link to the website  <answer17234> I use FastScripts and this AppleScript:  precodetell application "Finder" to set il to insertion location as alias set cmd to "cd " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of il tell application "Terminal"     activate     try         do script with command cmd in window 1     on error         do script with command cmd     end try end tell /code/pre  hr  Lion has services called emNew Terminal at Folder/em and emNew Terminal Tab at Folder/em:     h3Built-in systemwide services for Terminal/h3      You can create new sessions based on Finder folders or text paths selected in any application.   <comment18725> problem's solved, thanks! I use cdto as you recommended. I copied the app to my Finder's toolbar and it's working beautifully. IMO this app should come with Apple OS X default feature. <comment18735> Ah, thanks for mentioning Lion got that service. <comment18752> Very interesting service indeed.
