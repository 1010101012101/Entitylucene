where are the pictures of the skype contacts saved (see if someone is invisible) <body> i just thought you could see if someone is invisible in skype, if you just delete (reset) his profile picture. Because i know if you install skype on a new device the profile pictures are saved only if he is online (or invisible). That means if i just want to so if someone is invisible you just delete or reset his profile picture and if you see after a few seconds his picture again = he is invisible.  BUT... i don't know where the contact picture are saved on on my mac (running mountain lion). I just couldn't find theme... so if you know where they are saved, would it be great.  <answer88712> The avatars are cached in code~/Library/Application Support/Skype/AvatarCache/code.  To access this, open a Finder window, hit Cmd+Shift+G to bring up the "Go To" dialog, copy and paste that path in to the dialog and hit enter. You'll see a directory full of code.jpeg/code images -- those are the avatar images for your contacts.  Edit: Buscar's answer is correct. These appear to be left over from a very old version of Skype.  <answer88715> On Skype 6.3.xx the avatars are stored in  precode~/Library/Caches/com.skype.skype/(your skype name)/SKAvatarCache /code/pre  in TIFF format. You can view them by in Preview by opening Terminal and running   precodeopen ~/Library/Caches/com.skype.skype/(your skype name)/SKAvatarCache/(name of the file) /code/pre  <comment103961> thx for the fast answer but i couldn't finde a file called AvatarCach  i only have files like my username and other files but no AvatarCach <comment103962> It's a directory. And make sure you spell it correctly. ;) <comment103966> i did exactly what you said but than it says "The Folder can't be found" (i don't know if it is important but i am running mountain lion) <comment103967> I do not have that AvatarCache on my MBA 10.8 <comment103983> What version of Skype are you running? Looks like the first path I found are leftovers from an old version of Skype, but I'm not sure how old. <comment103991> Skype version 6.3.0.582 <comment104004> Skype's files are stored in ~/Library/Application Support/Skype but there are no icon visible. They are probably embedded in a binary file.
