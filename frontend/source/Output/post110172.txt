iMessage no longer able to reach a specific contact <body> My friend H. is on assignment in Asia.  We iMessage a few times per week.  Last Thursday an iMessage I sent him got rejected:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/srYxz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This only happened when I iMessaged him, and he was still able to iMessage me.  We tried FaceTime and that didn't work either.  He fiddled with his settings and then when I tried to iMessage him I got the iPhone error message: "This person cannot be reached by iMessage at this time"  <answer110173> The reason it was broken: the specific contact had changed his AppleID password and had not updated it on his iPhone.    The solution that worked for us:  ol liHe reset his AppleID (c.f.: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5624)/li liHe updated the password at iPhone (iOS7)  Settings  Messages/li liHe updated the password at iPhone  Settings  FaceTime/li liI reset my network settings: my iPhone (iOS7)  Settings  General  Reset  Reset Network Settings/li /ol  He didn't have to reset his network settings, and neither of us powered our iPhones off/on.
