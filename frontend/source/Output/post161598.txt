iPhone 6 won't store emails <body> My iPhone 6 running of iOS 8.1.2 won't store all my flagged emails, 5 and only seems to remember 3 out of the 5. Until you actually search for the emails it can't be found by looking through inbox or updating. Restarting the phone does not do anything.   This is also the case for regular emails where older emails  seem to vanish until you search for them too. They are not stored in trash, junk or in archive. On settings I have checked that emails will not be deleted without asking first. Please help. Many thanks.   <comment188835> Check your sync settings and see how many days you've got it set to sync. <comment188850> What type of email are you using... if the answer is exchange then I'll bet "Mail days to sync" is the issue.  Like IMAP, Exchange is server based, so you mail just isn't downloading because it's outside the time window.  (although that is also possible with IMAP accounts, apple didn't implement it in iOS.)
