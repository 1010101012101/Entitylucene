What are launchd's LaunchAgents directories for? <body> I created some job plist files and put them in code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code. Now I don't see the point of this special directory (see launchd manpage). When I want to load a job, I have to specify a whole path to a plist file. Or can I somehow restart launchd so that it reads those files again?  <answer98411> Depending on the key codeDisabled/code the job definitions in code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code will be loaded automatically by codelaunchd/code whenever the user logs in.
