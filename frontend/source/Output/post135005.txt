Network service inactive/Unable to add Wi-Fi network on mac pro <body> I have no idea what happened but my Wi-fi network has disappeared completely! The Wi-fi icon found on the top menu bar is gone. I'm unable to create a new Wi-fi network service but only able to connect to the internet via LAN cable. I've checked my system information and it says that my network service is inactive. Not sure if reformatting my laptop would make a difference.

Or switch your location back to automatic if it isn't already.  <comment160567> Hi dlamblin! Thank you so much fr yr reply! Tried + sign to create new Wi-fi but nothing happens. Not sure if its the airport problem. <comment164489> @needhelp Alright, now that's mysterious... It would seem that either the device is broken or the drivers that would support it don't work for you. Sometimes for the latter this is fixed with a permissions fix in the disk utility's repair options.
