Repeated "styles" folder in trash <body> I am having recurring "styles" folder inside my trash and when I try to delete it, it is showing "the operation cannot be completed because the item "styles" is in use! Is this a virus?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIk82.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer251061> This answer by Matthieu Riegler suggests the following when dealing with a Trash that won't empty (this does not, however, address WHAT the files are or whether they are malicious):  hr  When you have problems to empty the trash, coderm -rf ~/.Trash/*/code in the terminal does the job for you.  You have to keep in mind that there might be multiple .Trash directories.  For example on a USB stick or a external Drive, OSX will create another .Trash at the root of the drive. So you might need to use  coderm -rf /Volumes/DriveName/.Trash.*/code  <comment312006> What is the root folder inside trash that all these styles folders are located in? <comment312010> @IronCraftMan it starts with "styles" ....... not sure how it ends  ..... downloaded clamxav and scanning now
