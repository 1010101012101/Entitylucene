Removing a Gmail account on a computer I'm selling <body> How do I remove a Gmail account in Apple Mail on a computer I am giving away? I do use IMAP and want to make sure I don't lose any of my emails on my other computer and iPad.  <answer89232> All you need to do is remove that account from the Mac you intend to sell and all your emails will subsequently be deleted emfrom that Mac/em and no other devices will be affected. To remove the account:  ol liOpen Mail Preferences (kbdCmd/kbd + kbd,/kbd or Mail - Preferences)/li liSelect "Accounts"/li liSelect the account(s) that you wish to remove, and proceed to select the minus button below the list of accounts./li liAccept the prompt by clicking "Remove"./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WloYk.png" alt="Mail Preferences"  <comment104646> If you are giving the computer away I would do more than remove the email - I would at least remove the user and delete all its data, or better reformat, reinstall the OS. <comment104647> @Mark, Point taken.
