Why does iTunes repeatedly start playing <body> Whenever I plug my 13" MacBook Pro into my TV (via DVI) iTunes spontaneously starts playing.  If I quit it, it reopens and starts playing again.  I ended up having to rename iTunes.app to get it to stop.  <comment80527> I just thought of something; I'm using the headphone jack to connect audio; could something on that end up being interpreted as a "play" command from a headset? <comment80528> Has this always happened, or did it just recently start? <comment80532> Open Console.app before you plug the MacBook in, plug it in, and watch if messages appear in the `All Messages` section of Console.app. This might give you a pointer on what process is causing this.
