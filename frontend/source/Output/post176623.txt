iOS 7, Facebook Messenger app keeps crashing <body> I was using my Facebook messenger app, and it suddenly crashed. I tried to open it again, but it kept crashing either instantly or after 20 seconds or so.  I've tried to turn it off and on, and delete and reinstall but its not working. Is there anything else I can do? What's wrong with it?  <answer196557> An app that consistently crashes on launch is usually due to the device being out of memory (RAM, not system storage).
