Should a MacBook emit EMF fluctuations when wifi and bluetooth are turned off? <body> I have a couple of MacBooks. Both have SSD drives.  Using a Trifield EMF meter with radio/microwave capability, if I hold the meter near the laptop (where I understand the wifi antenna is located), I receive blips ranging from 4-30 milligauss.  A bit less on the radio/electric setting.  Sometimes they are repetitious quick blips, other times they are more erratic.  If I hold the meter near the back of the laptop where the antenna connector is, I get readings that base around 80 milligauss to off of the scale (over 100 milligauss).  Holding it near the wireless router, it's movement between 4-20 milligauss in EMF, and a variance in radio/microwave of 0.5 to 2.5 (0.5mW/cm^2 to 2.5/cm^2).  I would guess that a wireless router would constantly send a signal, but no wireless devices are actually connected.   I work in a high security field and am wondering if the wifi is actually transmitting even though it is set to "off" in the operating system. E.g., due to a root kit or other virus.  Can other components in a MacBook cause quick fluctuations of this much? I would expect it to remain mostly constant if Bluetooth/wifi were not transmitting.    Also, how much would wifi/bluetooth emit if turned on, on average?  <comment271208> Have you tried to measure the values if you boot one of your laptops into single user mode? Hold down "Command-S" during book to enter single-user mode. This should keep your system in the most minimal setup possible. Check which network cards you have from the command line with "networksetup -listallhardwareports” Once you find the wifi Device you can check if it’s on with "networksetup -getairportpower DEVICE” where DEVICE will be something like en0 or en1 depending on how your system is configured. <comment271213> I have tried using the command line tools to disable the wireless adapter, using various commands that can do so.
