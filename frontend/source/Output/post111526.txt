Dictionaries and spell-checking <body> My default language is English, but I also sometimes type in Czech. I have added a Czech keyboard to OS X, and can switch between the two easily. The trouble is that OS X has no native Czech dictionary.  If I download Czech code.AFF/code and code.DIC/code files, I can place them inside code/Library/Spelling//code, but OS X does not switch which dictionary it uses for continuous spell-checking. I have "Automatic by Language" selected in the Keyboard preference pane, but this seems to work very sporadically, if at all.  Is there an easy solution here I am missing, or is this it? It seems odd that the keyboard and dictionary would not be linked, like they are in iOS. Any help would be appreciated!  <answer111527> Only iOS links the keyboard and the spellcheck, OS X has never done that.  Most people find "automatic" unreliable.  To activate czech spellcheck, you should set the spell check to czech, either in system prefs/language &amp; text/text/spelling or in Edit  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar.  In Pages 4 and earlier and iBooks Author, you need to set Inspector  Text  More  Language.  MS Word and some other apps do their own thing.  The app Nisus Writer has preference settings that let you link keyboard and spellcheck dictionary.  <comment138867> Could you add a link to where you got the dictionary files from.
