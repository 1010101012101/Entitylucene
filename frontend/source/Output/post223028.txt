Permission denied rm a symlink I own on OSX 10 <body> The output below confirms to me that "emp1" the current user own the symlink "npm", thus I should be able to rwx all day if I want to.    Why am I getting Permission denied when trying to remove it?  Thanks  precode~$ whoami empl1 ~$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/ lrwxr-xr-x   1 empl1  staff  38 26 Dec 16:02 npm -&gt; ../lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js ~$ rm /usr/local/bin/npm  rm: /usr/local/bin/npm: Permission denied /code/pre  <answer223031> Only users with write access to a directory can remove its content. In your case you can check with codels -ld /usr/local/bin/code who the owner of this directory is. And than either switch to this user or use codesudo rm /usr/local/bin/npm/code to remove the link.   <comment270322> The directory is owned by "admin" so I did the command you suggested but got back "Password: Sorry, try again." with correct admin password typed. <comment270323> You need to type your own password. If your user doesn't have admin rights, you need to log in as an admin user first. <comment270325> When I type emp1 password, I get "empl1 is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.",  I want emp1 just to do this task and not to give permanent higher privilege. <comment270333> On a standard OSX installation only admin users can use sudo. So there is no way around switching users here (which is a 1 minute task if you have Fast User Switching enabled in System Preferences).
