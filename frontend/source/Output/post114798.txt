for what should I use fn key by default on mac book pro <body> I have codefn/code key in left bottom conner of my macbook pro keyboard. For what purpose does it exist?   I understand that I can remap it to my needs, but what is its default function?  <answer114801> It swaps the function of the function keys between the OS X function and the actual F1-F12 key. For example, pressing F1 normally will lower the brightness, but pressing fn+F1 will pass an actual F1. You can see these mappings by looking at the icon on the key itself.  This can be swapped in System Preferences → Keyboard so that fn+F1 will lower brightness and F1 will pass an actual F1.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GrDZD.png" width="400"  Alternatively you can swap it by running the following Terminal command, then logging out:  precodedefaults write -g com.apple.keyboard.fnState -bool true /code/pre  Also, fn+fn is used by default to start OS X Dictation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BdVgP.png" width="300"  Perhaps the most common usage though, is using kbdFN/KBD+KBDBackspace/KBD to get a delete key.  hr  You can learn this by using help from Finder (⌘?), search for "fn" and read the article titled "Use keyboard function keys"  <comment134479> More generally, it’s used to get at keys that would be on an extended keyboard, that aren’t on a notebook one: Fn+cursor up/down are page up/down, and Fn+cursor left/right are home/end.
