IOS9 change date format <body> I am using the iOS 9 beta and I am trying to change the date format to strongdayofweek-dayofmonth-month-year/strong.   For example today would be:      Tuesday, Aug 25, 2015   In settings I have looked under language and region, and at the bottom of the page there is something that shows region format example, but I cannot find a way to set a custom date format without changing my region (which still doesn't allow custom, but it will change it).   Under date and time there isn't anything either.   Thanks!
