Unable to directly paste a link from Twitter into web forms in Mobile Safari <body> When I copy a codet.co/code link (strongtap/hold/strong  codeCopy link/code) from the Twitter app, I am unable to paste into strongany/strong web forms in Mobile Safari. I can still paste into other objects (e.g. the address bar, the search bar, the Notes app, etc).  Is this a bug? How can I avoid having to first paste the link and then recopy (codeSelect All &gt; Copy/code) it as @iglvzx suggests in the comments?  <answer180173> I had the same problem. I closed Twitter out and re-opened, then I was able to paste again.  <comment48360> Which web page? Which form? Most likely, this is a problem with the web page itself, rather than iOS or Twitter. <comment48361> I try to paste the link on the search form on http://www.google.com <comment48362> Strange. I can confirm this. I workaround is to paste it somewhere else and then `Select All  Copy`. Then you can paste it into Google. Edit: I stand corrected, there is something definitely going wrong here. Perhaps something with the way Twitter saves to the clipboard.
