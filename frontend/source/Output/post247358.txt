Wake on LAN on Linux <body> I just learned that I could wake my Macbook Air 2012 from sleep over the LAN under OS X.  However, I can't make it work under Linux with the method described on the Arch Wiki.  Has anyone managed to do it on Linux?  <comment305229> Please add a link to the Arch Wiki and the Linux flavor in use! Also: one Arch wiki mentions: wireless cards do not support Wake-on-LAN <comment305232> You are running Linux on the MacBook, I assume? <comment305239> @patrix, yes.---
