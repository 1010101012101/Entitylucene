Windows 7 bootcamp won't pair bluetooth keyboard <body> I have a MacMini 2,1 with Lion and Windows 7 via bootcamp. In Mac OS my MS bluetooth keyboard 6000 works fine (as MS bluetooth mouse). In Windows, I did install the latest drivers, Intellipoint 8 etc., but the Keyboard won't pair. I type the code, it says it's paired but the keyboard keeps blinking and does not work.   I bought a wired simple Lite "Standard" keyboard, but there is a problem: when booting to Windows, there is a menu windows / macos, and the macos is the default choice unless I press arrow key to choice windows. However, wired keyboard won't work, only the bluetooth! So I have to keep bluetooth keyboard paired in macos and the wired keyboard to use windows...  So the bluetooth keyboard works in macos and during boot, but not after Windows 7 initialize. The bluetooth mouse won't work either. Maybe the bluetooth driver... Any ideas?
