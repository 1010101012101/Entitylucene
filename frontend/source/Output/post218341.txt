Most of the time spotlight is showing nothing after upgrading to el capitan <body> I use spotlight a lot but after upgrading to el capitan most of the time its showing empty window.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvmb3.png" alt="enter image description here"  Its very annoying. How can i solve this problem?  <answer218342> I too see this behaviour. Typing an extra letter or even removing a letter from the search term tends to fix the problem.  This appears to be a bug in OS X 10.11. Please can you provide feedback to Apple. Every report helps!  <comment263943> thanks @Graham I have provided my feedback to apple.
