Apple TV movie rental download takes hours <body> Movie rental through my Apple TV (3rd generation) takes hours to begin playing. The screen displays "your movie will start in 4 hours 50 minutes" for example. Once the movie did start after only 40 minutes or so, but the continuing download did not keep up with the now playing movie.  Other streaming content through Apple TV works fine. emOnly/em movie rental is problematic.  Renting through iTunes on my Mac is normal, starting after only a couple minutes (if that) of buffering.  Our AT&amp;T provided modem is working fine. No problems with our Wi-Fi cable box or computers.  I have tried:  ul lirebooting/li liphysically unplugging and waiting/li lia Reset/li lia Restore. /li /ul  Restore automatically fetched the latest Apple tvOS update. I have fiddled with the Wi-Fi modem settings (based on Googling the problem) - frequency, 802.11g vs 802.11n for example.   How can I troubleshoot this further?
