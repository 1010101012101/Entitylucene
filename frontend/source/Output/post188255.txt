Yosemite Regularly Crashes, Returns to Login Screen <body> I have a Macbook Pro 6,2 (mid-2010 model) with Yosemite installed. Recently, my computer has started crashing in a number of ways. First of all, it often crashes and bumps me back to the login screen (which normally is disabled, as I'm the only user of my computer and I just have it start up on its own). This seems to happen most frequently while using Firefox, but also happens occasionally at other times. Firefox also often crashes (without the computer's crashing), and every so often Google Chrome crashes too.  I've also been getting assertion failed errors with Finder. This is the log from Console from the kernel panic I just had a moment ago:  code5/21/15 11:30:56.158 PM Finder[248]: assertion failed: 14D136: libxpc.dylib + 62495 [D35D0DB2-D7BD-3BE4-8378-062BFE545E1D]: 0x89/code  It also just crashed to the login screen at 11:18 PM and 11:27 PM. Does anyone know what causes this - or how to resolve it?  Here are the console log from the latest crash:  precode5/21/15 11:27:15.000 PM kernel[0]: Data/Stack execution not permitted: WindowServer[pid 884] at virtual address 0x7fff52888000, protections were read-write 5/21/15 11:27:15.129 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.ReportCrash.Root[1112]) Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch(3) APIs.

I've run antivirus checks and didn't find anything, and also ran memtest86 to check if it was the memory, which it is not. I also read the previous Stack Exchange answers on similar issues, but I'm not sure what could be causing my problem. Any ideas as to what it could be?  <comment222725> It is having some sort of Graphics problem, but not sure why? <comment222728> Ah, thanks! Thanks to your comment, I looked up graphics problems for Macbook Pro 6,2 computers, and I found this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5759538?start=0&tstart=0 Looks like it's a known issue where some chips had a Latent Defect. I'll have to take it in the Genius Bar to see if this is the issue I'm dealing with. <comment222977> Do you use f.lux? This may be the cause of the problem. <comment223190> I do use f.lux. If the Apple store says there's no problem with the logic board, I'll disable it and see if anything comes up. Is there a known issue with f.lux and Yosemite? <comment223263> Update on this: It's not f.lux; I disabled it, and the crashes continue. My computer passed the Visual Systems Test, so it's probably still the logic board, but I'm not certain. Quite the pain, hah. <comment223612> UPDATE AGAIN: It looks like f.lux was involved with the crashing to the login screen (the assertion failed error), as deactivating it has prevented that from happening again - and I got the error as soon as I turned it back on. I disabled Dropbox's Finder integration, and haven't had any kernel traps lately. Looking at some of the logs though, it looks like a problem with my Intel graphics DOES exist, even though the Video System Test at the Apple Store came up negative. <comment260940> How do you guys know that it's a gfx issue by looking at these logs? What are `BezelServices` ?
