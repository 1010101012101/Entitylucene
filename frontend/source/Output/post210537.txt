Can't use my 9.0.1 iPhone with Xcode <body> My Macbook and my iPhone are updated to the OS X 10.11 Capitan and iOS 9.0.1, but when I try to use my iPhone as a running device with Xcode, it tells me I can't use it because of the version of them.  I can't upgrade xCode (6.1). On the App Store, it tells me I'm on the latest version.  <answer210539> Current iOS is 9.0.2br Latest Xcode release is 7.0.1 - from the App Storebr I'd try updating to those first.  If iTunes doesn't seem to think it needs updating, you could always get the .ipsw file from one of the many direct download links available [the files come directly from Apple, just the links are published separately] then hold kbd Alt ‚å• /kbd whilst clicking the "Check for Update" button in iTunes &amp; manually navigate to the .ipsw  One source of links is always Redmondpie - http://www.redmondpie.com/download-ios-9.0.2-links-for-iphone-ipad-ipod-touch-ipsw/  <comment254111> Thanks for your answer. My bad, my iPhone is on 9.0.2. I can't upgrade xcode from the AppStore. I'm trying to install the new xcode 7 with the .dmg file. <comment254112> I'm not much of an Xcode user, so not certain, but I thought you just trashed the Xcode 6 app & then DL Xcode 7. Might be that major version numbers aren't directly upgradeable. <comment254122> I'm doing this, thanks :)
