Finder Problem - USB drive opening in separate window for every folder <body> Whenever I connect my USB drive or insert a disc and view the contents every folder is opened in a separate window, how do I prevent this?  'Open folders in tabs instead of new windows'  in the Finder Preferences is ticked.  Im using a MacBook Pro Yosemite 10.10.1, I also experience the same issues when using my works iMac.  I should mention that the USB drive was formatted on my former computer which was Windows 7 and also the CDs that I have inserted have also been created on Windows.  Could this be the issue?  Best regards  Elbow  <answer271242> The following trick worked for me.   ul liFocus the finder window from your external drive./li liSelect strongView/strong - strongShow Toolbar/strong option/li /ul  Now, the finder window will not open in new windows. But, I have to do this every time I open from the external hard drive. I'm still looking for a solution to this.  <comment340966> Try, after making sure the window is just how you want it (including size, sort mode, etc), opening View Options (command-J) and selecting "Use as Defaults."
