Mac to Mac Remote Desktop - Full Screen Option? <body> I recently got a MacBook Air for work and when working from home I'd like to connect to it from my 27" iMac so I can leverage the larger screen for additional working space.  I used to do this with my work PC and it worked really well, but the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client allows for a full screen function that expands the desktop so I can leverage the full 27".  I have Screen Sharing enabled on the Mac and it does work, but when choosing "Full Screen" it does not make the screen any larger than the 13" or so...   I'm okay to look at purchasing an alternative, but so far have not found one that works.  Any thoughts?
