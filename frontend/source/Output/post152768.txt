Cycle through spaces in Mavericks <body> On Snow Leopard you could "jump" from the last space to the first space by hitting cmd+right arrow.   How to do this in Mavericks?  <answer152772> To accommodate for not cycling anymore, you can enter a command for strongSwitch to Desktop 1/strong, i.e. kbd⌘/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd→/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AawHj.png" alt="mission control keyboard shortcuts"  <answer152773> They don't cycle any more, last to first.  I've found the best solution is to assign a key command to every Space you use &amp; go directly to the one you want.  I use Ctrl/number.  Additional irritation is that Fullscreen apps insert themselves into the 'list' of Spaces, but cannot be called directly.  <answer293290> I haven't tried it, but the app TotalSpaces2 seems to provide this feature:  https://totalspaces.binaryage.com/navigation2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRh95.png" alt="enter image description here"  Caveat:   In newer versions of macOS they require you to disable SIP when installing.  <comment179855> This is not cyclic like the question asked. This does not allow you to be on the last space and press `⌃ + →` to cycle back to the first space (at least on Mavericks). <comment179857> @aglasser Ah, didn't notice that.
