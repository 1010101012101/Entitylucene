Confused about USB-C transfer speeds of latest MacBook Pros <body> I was reading this  article about the next iteration to USB-C ports. It says that the new standard will double speeds from 5 Gbps to 10 Gbps.   It also says:   precodeif you just bought a brand new computer with USB-C port,  like, for example, the 2016 MacBook Pro that I'm using to write this  article, you're pretty much screwed. /code/pre   But according to Appleâ€™s website their USB-C ports  support up to 40 Gbps data transfer speeds. So this is strong4 x faster/strong than what the above article is saying about the new USB standard.   Can someone explain this to me? I am confused.  <answer293394> The USB-C ports on your MacBook support USB 3.1 (gen 2) AND Thunderbolt 3.  USB 3.1 gives you a transfer speed of 10 Gbit/s and Thunderbolt 3 is capable of up to 40 Gbit/s.  Note however that just because a device has an USB-C connector that doesn't imply that it supports USB 3.1 gen 2 and thus 10 Gbit/s. It can also be USB 3.1 emgen strong1/em/strong, which is basically USB 3.0, which is 5 Gbit/s.  <comment370163> And people thought a single connector would simplify everything. <comment370418> It is worse, a Type-C connector can be designed into devices that might support only USB 2.0 rates (HS, FS, LS), and it still will be a Type-C connector. So there are Type-C USB 2.0-only C-C cables, all within official specifications.
