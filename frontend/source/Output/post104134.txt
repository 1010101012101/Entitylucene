Login as TeamsServer system user <body> How can I login as the _teamsserver user? I have sudoed and set the passwd for teamsserver, but it does not take it when I use the login command. I need to see the output of some scripts as they are run by teamsserver, and verify that teamsserver has the correct permissions and utilities available.  <answer104136> To just look at log files etc. I usually use either  precodesudo less /path/to/log/file /code/pre  or (in case I need root access longer) run codesudo -s/code to get a root shell.  To run processes as another user you can use   precodesudo -H -u _teamserver cmd-to-run /code/pre  And finally, to simulate a login there is  precodesudo -H -u _teamserver -i /code/pre  <comment122613> I usually just use `sudo` to look at any log files (or `sudo -s` to get a root shell), would this work for you as well? <comment122614> No, I can do that, but I need to run a script as teamsserver. I need to make sure the teamsserver user has all the correct utilities and permissions. <comment122621> Thanks, the -H -u is what I was looking for. <comment122622> Actually, it seems to work, but it is still not running as teamsserver. When I check (echo $ENVVAR) an environment variable that I know is set in teamsserver, it does not show <comment122648> `-i` reads `.profile` from the home directory of the user, in this case from `/var/teamserver`
