mysql: command not found <body> How do I use MySQL from the CLI?  When I use the terminal, I get:  precodeDarrens-MacBook-Pro:~ thufir$  Darrens-MacBook-Pro:~ thufir$ mysql -bash: mysql: command not found Darrens-MacBook-Pro:~ thufir$  /code/pre  As you can see, MySQL is installed and running:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0QN1G.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  this system:  precodeSystem Software Overview:    System Version:   OS X 10.10.2 (14C1510)   Kernel Version:   Darwin 14.1.0   Boot Volume:  Mac OSx   Boot Mode:    Normal   Computer Name:    A MacBook Pro   User Name:    thufir (thufir)   Secure Virtual Memory:    Enabled   Time since boot:  2:08 /code/pre  <answer177858> The Oracle installer for MySQL puts the codemysql/code binary in code/usr/local/mysql/bin/code. You either need to call it with the full path:  precode/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql /code/pre  Or put code/usr/local/mysql/bin/code in your codePATH/code by adding the following to end of your code~/.bash_profile/code:  precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:${PATH} /code/pre  And then reloading your shell.  See my answer to this question for why I think you should install these things with Homebrew instead of dmg-based installers. Ultimately, it lets you manage what's in your codePATH/code with less hassle.  <comment211592> my question is why the dmg installer doesn't just add mysql to the path...coming from Linux, that seems broken. <comment211593> It's generally not the case that dmg-based installers on OS X modify your `PATH`. There's a very "don't do unexpected things to user's environments" ethos to installer packages on OS X.
