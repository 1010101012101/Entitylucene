Crazy internet connection. Bluetooth Pan works, ethernet does not on Specturm (TWC) <body> Ok, my Specturm (former TimeWarner) modem Wifi connection shows up in drop down list. But does not accept password. I connect a direct ethernet cable. Nope, no internet,  yet lights are all flashing green.  I see Bluetooth Pan is active, I take a chance, it gives my a high speed connection. Yet if I pull out the ethernet cable, I lose my Bluetooth connection.  What the heck is going on?  MacOS 10.12.6 Sierra MacBook. I am using a Insignia ethernet to USB, but that should have role in the mystery.  thanks, :-)   <comment371425> Ok, I changed the service order. Moved ethernet to top. It turned on, Bluetooth went off. I'll live with it.   Specturm can help with the WiFi I'm sure. When in doubt, click that gear, and play with "Service Order" :-)
