MySQL Preference Pane control for MySQL installed via Homebrew <body> I have installed MySQL via homebrew: codebrew install mysql/code. I'd like to get the MySQL preference pane hooked up to my installation of MySQL through homebrew. How can I achieve this?  <answer43630> My understanding is that you can't get the MySQL Preference Pane via homebrew.  But if you download the 64-bit DMG file from MySQL's community server download page, it includes an installer, preference pane, and startup script.  See also the answer to this StackOverflow question, about installing MySQL on Lion.  <answer48985> See my answer to your question at superuser.com.  <comment14728> You might get a better audience over at http://superuser.com - it's more geared to ports and MySQL and yes, homebrew is a program to help port things to mac, but to MySql and the preference panel are general to all OS and not mac-specific. <comment14730> I agree that you might want to try this question over at SU.  Also, consider installing MAMP (http://www.mamp.info/) instead -- it's a "friendlier" way to get MySQL running on your Mac (along with Apache and PHP). <comment14736> @Austin I will not be using MAMP as I do not need apache and php. I just need MySQL. <comment14737> You could just think of it as "updating" Apache and PHP, since your Mac comes with both anyway.  You could be rocking a working MySQL installation in less than five minutes.  Up to you, though. <comment14779> @Austin thanks but no thanks.
