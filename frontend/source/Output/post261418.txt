El Capitan Changes Default Program To Preview On Its Own <body> I upgraded to El Capitan about 6 months ago and it has an annoying problem.  I cannot figure out why, but at least a few times a week it sets the default program for PDF and Excel files to preview rather than adobe acrobat and excel respectively.  I reset it by clicking on get info - open with - change all. It works for a while and then at some point goes back to preview.  I have searched forums but have not seen anyone else with this error.  Any ideas how to repair this once and for all?
