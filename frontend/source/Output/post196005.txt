How to force Safari to warn before leaving a page when a form is filled in but not submitted <body> I used to see Safari (8, currently) warn about filled-in forms before navigating off a page.    I just lost a large writing twice due to accidental swipe on the trackpad/clicking, and had no warning, and when navigating back, the form was cleared (I also have seen before when Safari would retain the form information you'd typed when navigating backâ€“why is this inconsistent?).  I want to shoot myself in the face.  Rather than shoot myself in the face, I'd rather make this behavior like it should be.  Is there a way to re-enable the warnings, and/or retaining what you've written, using settings, or is there a plug-in that can do this?    It seems like this has happened at least once to most people I know.  <answer196016> Try this in Terminal  codedefaults write com.apple.Safari DebugConfirmTossingUnsubmittedFormText -integer -1/code  Which seems slightly odd, as the opposite is code-bool false/code but that's what "Secrets" shows for the 2 alternatives.br http://secrets.blacktree.com/edit?id=2467 ought to be the page with the defaults data for that, but the entire site is coming up 404 today.
