Yosemite Upgrades: Lost and Broken User Accounts <body> I've run into a series of issues that have arisen after installing Yosemite, and I was wondering if anyone has an idea what's happening. They all emfeel/em related.  The Setup:  I have a "old style" Mac Pro with several users. My main user account ("Main") is split over two drives, with the Home folder on an HDD, but the rest of it on the SSD boot drive. There is a second user, "Media", with the same setup. And finally, there's another user "Second" which lives entirely on the Boot SSD.  Upon upgrading to Yosemite, the following things have occured:  ul li"Main" appears to be fine. A little unresponsive perhaps, but fine./li li"Second" is, well, hosed. Trying to access the Desktop or Documents folder returns a permissions error, which repair permissions doesn't seem to fix. It also complains about not being able to find a keychain, and gives this warning:/li /ul     "Mac OS X needs to repair your Library to run applications.  Type your password to allow this.   Name:    Password: _____"   ul li"Media" isn't present in the login window at startup, nor the login menu. Though System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups shows it just fine./li /ul  Any idea what's happening, and why? I'd prefer not to salt the earth and start over with this system, but I'm running out of ideas.  <comment185508> What do you mean when you say the account is "split over two drives, with the Home folder on an HDD"? The user's account is, for most purposes, their home folder. What are you considering part of their account that is on another drive? <comment185548> @tubedogg - There's still a folder in the SSD that houses some residual things in Application Support.
