All my iMessages were deleted <body> My iPod Touch ran out of battery and died for a short time. When I plugged it back in and it turned back on, all of my conversations on iMessage had been deleted. I still have the contacts but all of my texts and messages were gone. Why did this happen and is there any way to get my messages back?  <answer189029> There ( sorry ) Is no possible way to get your messages back. The reason is is probably because your iPod was corrupt or not up to date. Simply contact an apple store and turn your Pod in, and they should give u a replacement while they check for a virus. Other reason may be because someone sent u a corrupt picture, long text, or virus text while your phone was off. Update your iPhone ( Software update ) and it'll never happen again.   <comment207487> Restore from a backup <comment223953> Please provide a source for your claims. To my knowledge iMessages are stored on iCloud servers. What viruses are there for iPods?
