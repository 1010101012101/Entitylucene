Display a dependency graph <body> I am looking for an application that allows to display a dependency graph, and the "entities" that are part of the graph.br Suppose I define the "task" entity; the software should allow me to define the fields associated to that entity, which include a reference to other tasks. It should then show the entities in a graph that evidences which task have a dependency, and with what. In that way, I could pick up a task without dependencies, or the task from which three or more other tasks depends from.  Differently from a Gantt chart, time is not involved in the graph I am referring. The application should be generic enough to work with any entities, and any data associated with them; in my example, I could be able to replace emtask/em with emproject/em, emperson/em, emcompany/em.  Is there such an application? What is the application that is closer to the requirements I reported?  <comment29622> If you are willing to write the code that traverses the dependency graph, there are a large number of applications that will display it.  The easiest start would be to look at digraphs in GraphViz. http://www.graphviz.org/  I've used JGrapht in Java, Groovy, and other JVM languages, and Mathematica as well, if those are options for you.
