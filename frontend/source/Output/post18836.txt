Dictionary is showing strange characters when "US English (IPA)" is selected <body> I was using the Dictionary application, and I have noticed it was showing the pronunciation using strange characters.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JHGV0.png" alt="Dictionary screenshot"  I checked the preferences, and they were set to use the American IPA characters.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JJH7j.png" alt="Dictionary preferences"  Out of curiosity, I changed the option to "US English (Diacritical)"; I then re-typed the same word, and I have got this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yq70d.png" alt="Dictionary screenshot"   It seems that it uses diacritical characters when it should use IPA, and vice versa. Something changed in the last twenty-four hours, as it was working fine, the last time I used it.  I think the problem is one of the preference files used by the Dictionary application. Which file should I restore, to get back the Dictionary application working as it is supposed to do?br Could it be another problem? Which one could be causing this?  <answer18886> I also see code|"br{k@t|/code when viewing embracket/em with US English IPA on a local Snow Leopard installation.  But, it is not a problem displaying the IPA characters themselves. Other words that shared those mis-transcribed vowel sounds are displayed correctly:  ul liembracket/em code|"br{k@t|/code/li liembrackish/em code|ˈbrækɪʃ|/code/li liembran/em code|bræn|/code/li liemkit/em code|kɪt|/code/li /ul  My guess it that there is just an error in the US English IPA transcription for embracket/em.  <comment20630> It looks like the "diacritical" setting is working as it should, but the IPA setting is having trouble displaying the non-ASCII IPA characters. The vowel sounds displayed as [ and @ in the IPA transcription should be æ and ɪ, respectively. Do the corrected letters in the last sentence display correctly for you? (The first one should look like an a and e smashed together, and the second one should look like a short uppercase I). <comment20645> I see both _æ_ and _ɪ_ correctly, in your comment; so far, I have not have any problems with Unicode characters, except with Dictionary, it seems. <comment20694> Woah! Yes, you're right; I can confirm br{k@t on a third Snow Leopard install (our secondary computer, which I haven't gotten around to upgrading yet). For what it's worth, brækɪt shows up correctly in Lion. Add one to the feature list, I guess :) <comment20699> I see those word pronunciations exactly as you do.
