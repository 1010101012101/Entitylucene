Store SSH public/private keys in iCloud Keychain <body> Is this possible?  When going into the "Keys" category in iCloud Keychain, the + button seems to be disabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/voxN1.png" alt="Keychain Access on OSX"  <comment275506> I can't add keys in `login` keychain either. Maybe you can't add keys manually. <comment275508> If you add the key to the login keychain (via ssh-add, as in http://superuser.com/questions/88470/how-to-use-mac-os-x-keychain-with-ssh-keys ), can you drag/drop it to the iCloud keychain after that? <comment275511> Nope. "An error has occurred. Unable to add an item to the current keychain. One or more parameters passed to a function were not valid."
