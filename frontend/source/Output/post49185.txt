Share connection over ethernet on jailbroken appletv <body> Would it be possible to have an (jailbroken) ATV2 share a WiFi connection over its Ethernet port? I'd say yes, but I can't seem to find any information about this.   hr  I found this helpful, yet not, link: http://www.perthstreetbikes.com/forum/f40/nerd-question-ios-bsd-wifi-ethernet-bridge-possible-125668/  <comment56609> It should be possible, but you'd have to write a package yourself that does it or wait for someone else to come along and program it.
