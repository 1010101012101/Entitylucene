Command+Tab misbehaving for apps on multiple monitors <body> I tend to keep a few Terminal windows open in one monitor, and another Terminal window and Chrome open in another monitor.  When I'm using a single monitor, pressing ⌘⇥ remembers which Terminal window was last selected, but when some of the Terminal windows are on one monitor and some on another, ⌘⇥ away from Chrome always goes to the Terminal on the same monitor, not the Terminal on the other monitor, which is the Terminal window I last selected.  strongTL;DR. Is there a setting I can tweak to get ⌘⇥ to work in multi-monitor mode as it does in single monitor mode, remembering the last selected window for each app?/strong  System:  ul liTerminal.app/li liChrome.app (latest official stable)  sup(Though I could have listed any two apps.)/sup/li liMac OS X 10.9 Mavericks/li /ul  <answer129904> It seems that this is related to displays having separate spaces. This can be changed by unchecking System Preferences - Mission Control - Displays have separate Spaces. (requires logout+login)  Note that with this you'll get the old full screen with multiple monitors support (that isn't so nice usually)  Related also to other multi-monitor functionality things, see for example cmd-tab behavior on Mavericks with multiple displays.
