Photos app not accepting a file when consolidating the Photo Library <body> Following on from a previous question I had asked how to avoid getting missing file error.brbr I am attempting to consolidate the Photos Library to bring in all files into the photos library.brbr During this process I get a missing file error, when I choose the folder that contains the file Photos app refuses to accept this location and shows the following dialog box.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CFx18.png" alt="Could not find original file"  I know the file is there. What is wrong? Why can't photos app find it? How do I fix this?br strongUpdate 1/strongbr I have noticed that most of the files that Photos app can't find are in the same folder. I can't see what is so special about this perticular folder. Any ideas?  <comment325443> Is it possible that Photos is expecting to find it in a subfolder or something? i.e. is the structure of that folder the same as it was when you originally imported the files into Photos? <comment325534> Yes, it is. I tried this after flattening the dir structure as well, i.e. I copied all photos/images to a single directory and pointed Photos app to that folder.
