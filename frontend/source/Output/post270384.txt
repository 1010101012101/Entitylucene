Not getting video from GTX 970, Mac Pro 2008 (MacPro3,1) <body> We had a hard drive crash with 10.10.5. I replaced the hard drive, reloaded 10.10 using my native ATI 2400 XT, ran all updates, installed latest web drivers, added the codenvda_drv=1/code boot argument, shut down, popped in the GTX 970, heard the chime for start-up but did not get to desktop. I am aware that the boot screen won't appear. I put the GTX 970 in a PC and got video. What could be the issue?  <answer295342> This was solved by:  ol limaking sure the PCIe cables were properly seated, on the Mac Pro motherboard./li liclearing NVRAM by cmd + option + p + r./li liinstalling Nvidia drivers (which adds the codenvda_drv=1/code flag as part of the installer)./li liplace GTX 970 in slot 2, making sure PCIe connection is on tight./li lisystem boots properly./li lishutdown, then move card to slot 1, making sure PCIe power connection is on tight./li lisystem boots properly./li /ol  <comment339791> Have you tried using screen sharing from another Mac to diagnose the problem? I find myself doing that often with the PC graphics card in my Mac Pro. <comment339800> Update: adding a 8800 GTX, which should be slightly higher in TDP, produces one loud long single beep, sort of like a screech. Immediately pulled the power, thinking I had done some irreparable damage to the computer, but research suggests that this is a beep caused by an underpowered video card. Is it safe to say that it's a power issue? <comment339805> Pull the GT8800. Then make sure BOTH 6-pin power connectors are attached to both the computer and the GTX970. You ALWAYS need to use all of the power ports on graphics cards <comment339839> Sorry, that should have read his replaced instead of Addong. I took out the 970 and put in the 8800, which is what we used before the 970 arrived. The 970 results in black screen with a boot up chime and the 8800 by itself results in the beep that suggest no power. Thoughts? <comment372929> Welcome to Ask Different!
