Adding an exchange account to an iPhone <body> After I upgraded my iPhone to iOS7 my Exchange account disappeared from the phone and I haven't found a way to add it back. Can somebody please explain how to do this?  <answer118633> If you open up "Settings" and choose "Mail, Contacts, Calendars" then under "Accounts" you should see "Add Account". Clicking on that allows you to choose to add an Exchange account.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nb8Ot.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment138388> Thanks for clarifying the question. You can also just edit the question directly to change it. <comment138390> I wasn't **exactly**  sure I was right since it was so badly worded. <comment138391> Oh, and thanks for adding the screen dump.
