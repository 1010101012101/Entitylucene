When I open the Music D/L app, it quits immediately <body> I have an iPad mini, and I have this app called Music D/L. So, a few months ago, I decided to download a song and when I went into the app, it had a black screen for a split second, and it just crashed.  In the comments please don't say "delete the app and download it again, everything will be fine!". Trust me, it won't :(. This music app was taken down on the App Store, so I can't get it again if I delete it. All of my songs are on this app and I don't want to delete the app and get a new music downloader because:  ol liThere isn't that many good ones out there./li liI won't be able to remember all of the music I downloaded./li /ol  Please tell me what to do ASAP!  P.S. Yes, I tried resetting my iPad and turning it off and all that stuff, I tried everything!   <answer231067> I googled a bit and you're not the only one with this problem. It could be that Apple has decided that this app is a bad app. That would explain why it's not available in the App Store anymore and why it won't start anymore: Apple can do that (I think it has to do with the certificate of the developer).  Another possibility would be that you upgraded to a newer version of iOS and that the app is not compatible with the newer version. And for some reason, the developer is no longer supporting the app.  Either way, I don't think it is possible to retrieve your songs. Please don't shoot the messenger.  <comment282027> Oh and by the way, this 'crashing' had been happening on a few other apps, too. My computer is broken, so no answers with computers please and thank you! <comment282518> Thanks. I'll try not to shoot the messenger. I'll try to get a new app. I also has a look on Google, and it said that it could be because of little storage. Thanks for your answer :)
