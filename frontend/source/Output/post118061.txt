mac os x what the two forward slash root is? <body> On my mac os x I have two roots the second one has two forward slashes. //  wondering what that is. I searched everywhere but cant find any information about this.   <answer118091> This is a strange part of the POSIX specification.  See unix, difference between path starting with '/' and '//'.  Two slashes in the beginning of a pathname are interpreted in an implementation-defined way. As far as I know, only cygwin actually takes // to mean something different than / (//FOO maps to a network drive called FOO, / maps to the local root). On most other systems / and // are the same. Note that /// is interpreted as /.  Your shell is I suspect bash and it keeps the // just in case the OS does something special with it. On OSX it is the same as /.  <comment137815> Where do you see the "two roots"? In a path the slash can be repeated without any consequences. `///Users/myname/////Library` is exactly the same as `/Users/myname/Library`
