Now in emFinder/em, go to your emDownloads/em folder and double click on the NTFS for Mac file. The file should be mounted now. You will see that there is a codeUninstall NTFS for Mac/code program, simply double click it.  That's it. For more information you could refer to the user manual, especially the chapter "De-installing the Driver" page 21.
