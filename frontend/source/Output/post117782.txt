OSX 10.6.8 internal mic does not register voice in PhotoBooth but registers in system preferences <body> I am having issues where so far PhotoBooth video recordings and flash based web applications do not register my voice using the internal mic.  I have also tried with and without plugging in headphones (no mic on head phones).  strongemSystem Preferences - Sound - Input/em/strong however does register my voice as well as strongemSystem Preferences - Speech - Speech Recognition - Calibrate/em/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sxkeg.png" alt="System Preferences"  <answer117824> I know this is a stupid question but it just caught me when I was looking into your problem. Are you sure you have output set to codeInternal Speakers/code not something else like an Airplay device?  When you set the "Sound Effect" do you get noise out of the speakers
