iPhone 6s uncharged at 30% battery <body> So I have an iPhone 6s for about a year now, and a week ago or so it uncharged (died) at 30% about. Then today it uncharged again at 30%, I tried turning it on right after but it showed me the black screen you get when iPhone uncharges (with the red battery level), in 5 min I tried turning it on again and it successfully turned on showing me 34%, but then died again in a few seconds. What could be the problem and what is the possible solution?  Thanks in advance!   <answer265086> Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015.  If you have experienced this issue, please use the serial number checker to see if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.  <comment332351> I just found out I'm eligible for the battery replacement, is that the issue for sure? <comment332352> Yes, I experienced the same issues. After the battery was replaced I did not experienced it again.
