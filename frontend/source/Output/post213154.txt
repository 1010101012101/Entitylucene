Is there a more convenient VPN toggle in iOS 9.1? <body> Is there an convenient way for me to toggle VPN on or off in iOS 9.1 without navigating through the Settings screen each time?  Previously (on Android), I used an app to automate this based on my location and it was pretty reliable. Searching through the App Store, I am unable to find any advanced automation apps.   I have discovered FlipControlCenter which would place a convenient toggle button in the swipe up menu, however I'm currently running iOS 9.1 and would like to avoid jailbreaking if possible.  I am aware that some paid VPN services do have apps which can be launched and used to toggle VPN on or off, however I am running my own personal VPN service.  <answer213155> Try VPNOn (AppStore link). It has convenient toggles in Notification Center and Apple Watch.  <answer213156> use Launcher to add a link to Settings-VPN and many more to your Notification Center
