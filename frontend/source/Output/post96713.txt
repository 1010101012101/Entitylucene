AppleRAID 0+1 failure: [corestorage] LVG missing and cannot repair mirror <body> I just recently created a corestorage LVG and an encrypted volume that used an AppleRAID 0+1 array, but something has gone horribly wrong.  I had four 1TB disks, and created two 2TB stripes, codecbs1/code and codecbs2/code, and mirrored them in Disk Utility. Then I created a [corestorage] LVG and fed it the UUID of the mirrored device, and created an encrypted jHFS+ filesystem at 100% of the capacity of the 2TB mirror.  This worked great, and behaved nicely for over a week. Today I had a software update that resulted in a reboot, and my RAID didn't show up. The LVG I created using the AppleRAID is no longer showing up in codediskutil cs list/code and the mirror was set to auto repair and was making progress (it looked like cbs1 vanished but it was still there, so I thought it was an intermittent hardware issue on boot) and I let it make progress on the rebuild until it was complete, but it didn't end up the way I thought it would.  I now saw in codediskutil ar list/code that I had a missing or damaged mirror device, and so in an effort to be smart, I created another stripe of two other 1TB disks, called it codecbs3/code and attempted to add that as a spare or a member to the UUID of the mirror. emHOWEVER/em, this fails with an error of code-69848: Couldn't modify RAID set/code in both cases.  codediskutil ar list/code now gives me the following:  precodeAppleRAID sets (4 found) =============================================================================== Name:                 cbs1 Unique ID:            1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD Type:                 Stripe Status:               Online Size:                 2.0 TB (1999721791488 Bytes) Rebuild:              manual Device Node:          - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0  disk6s2   AA501823-4955-473B-A27E-0EEA9E75072A  Online     999860895744 1  disk7s2   A6486548-3E07-4C0F-8F88-BE909D23DC22  Online     999860895744 =============================================================================== =============================================================================== Name:                 Untitled Unique ID:            1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD Type:                 Mirror Status:               Online Size:                 2.0 TB (1999721758720 Bytes) Rebuild:              automatic Device Node:          - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -  -none-    1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD  Missing/Damaged 1  -none-    2B52C67D-801E-4481-A76B-F98FF28C13B5  Online     1999721758720 =============================================================================== =============================================================================== Name:                 cbs2 Unique ID:            2B52C67D-801E-4481-A76B-F98FF28C13B5 Type:                 Stripe Status:               Online Size:                 2.0 TB (1999721791488 Bytes) Rebuild:              manual Device Node:          - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0  disk8s2   890A3BB9-94CB-4E02-8580-5F16D94890FF  Online     999860895744 1  disk10s2  71C4DE7E-6EC2-4660-9CDA-0ED31574925D  Online     999860895744 =============================================================================== =============================================================================== Name:                 cbs3 Unique ID:            A153709E-88C8-4281-8268-F68C26077E6A Type:                 Stripe Status:               Online Size:                 2.0 TB (1999721791488 Bytes) Rebuild:              manual Device Node:          disk14 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0  disk2s2   C1227A8B-8215-4E7E-99C8-C8491B7D994F  Online     999860895744 1  disk4s2   A65356C3-270C-404B-82AC-9EAB042B9300  Online     999860895744 =============================================================================== /code/pre  This is doubly confusing because there is no codeDevNode/code for the mirror'ed volume, probably due to it previously being fed to codecorestorage/code. The mirror device doesn't show up in Disk Utility.app, but I see it as above in the CLI.  Flailing a little, I tried to repair the mirror using both UUIDs to no avail:  precodelindsay:~$ sudo diskutil ar repairmirror 1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD /dev/disk14 Password: Started RAID operation Can't add spare to the RAID set Error: -69848: Couldn't modify RAID lindsay:~$ sudo diskutil ar repairmirror 2B52C67D-801E-4481-A76B-F98FF28C13B5 /dev/disk14 Started RAID operation Can't add spare to the RAID set Error: -69848: Couldn't modify RAID  /code/pre  Uh oh!  Is it possible to import the corestorage LVG that I created against the mirror'ed device while the mirror is degraded?  <answer100125> Two sets use the same UUID!  precodeStripe-1 Name:                 cbs1 Unique ID:            1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD  Stripe-2 Name:                 cbs2 Unique ID:            2B52C67D-801E-4481-A76B-F98FF28C13B5  Create a mirror Name:                 Untitled Unique ID:            1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD /code/pre  That mirror has the same UUID as Stripe-1. You have defined a loop.  Maybe that's the source of your problem. You need a disktool to directly modify the contents of your disks to create unique UUIDs.
