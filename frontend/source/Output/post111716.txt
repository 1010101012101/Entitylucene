Is there a Mac app that will open all images within a folder, regardless of the folder depth? <body> I have a folder full of additional folders, each of which then contains images. The directory looks something like this:  precodefolder0     folder1         image1.jpg         image2.jpg         image3.jpg     folder2         image4.png         image5.png         image6.png         image7.png /code/pre  ...and so on. There are about 430 folders within the root one, and I'd estimate â‰ˆ20 images (with varying file types) within each subdirectory. Ideally I'd like to be able to browse through all the photos in order, but there doesn't seem to be a high-capacity image browser that can handle that.  The first solution that comes to mind would be to just merge all the folders into one, but the images have to remain in their respective folders.  Is there any app that can do this, or am I just grasping at thin air here?  <answer111718> Isn't this where you would want to utilize Smart Folders, and search for Images?  This tutorial gives an example, but I've outlined a basic overview below:     ul   liOpen New Smart Folder./li   /ul      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EH0Rf.png" alt="Open New Smart Folder"      ul   liSelect the type of search (in this case, type in images, and choose    Kind:Images from the selections.)/li   /ul      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cqet2.png" alt="Kind: Image"      ul   liLocate the Save button and save the search./li   /ul      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/77d4L.png" alt="Save"      ul   liChoose a meaningful name for the search. Optionally, check the codeAdd to Sidebar/code box./li   /ul      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zCFQo.png" alt="Name and Loc"      ul   liNote the presence of the saved Smart Folder search, presuming that you followed the above step./li   /ul      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kIMLG.png" alt="In Sidebar"   <answer111745> You might also just use Spotlight:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S5JMv.png" alt=""  mdfind sorts the files by the containing folder:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemKind=*image' -onlyin /path/to/folder /code/pre  This opens the first 100 images in Preview:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemKind=*image' -onlyin .|sed -n 1,100p|tr \\n \\0|xargs -0 open -a Preview /code/pre  If codekMDItemKind=*image/code is missing some file types, try using codekMDItemContentTypeTree=public.image/code.  <comment131351> That works great, thank you! Unfortunately Smart Folders cannot arrange the images by their original folder, but I guess that's a limitation I'll have to live with. <comment131369> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
