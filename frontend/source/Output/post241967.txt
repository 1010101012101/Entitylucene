Is there any way to use a USB camera connected to an iPhone? <body> I've got an iPhone and I've got a USB camera. Is there any way to plug the camera into the iPhone and use it as the source camera for Facebook Live or other camera related items?  <answer242088> You should plug both your iPhone and camera to your computer. Then you sync the pictures from the camera to your iPhone. I think this is the only way it can work. Good luck!  <comment297431> Why?  The iPhone's front camera is likely better. <comment297432> The Theta is a full 360 camera. <comment297434> What cable does that camera use? <comment297435> It has a USB port and a HDMI port. Connected to the computer I can do live video over the USB port. Connected to a TV, the HDMI port. <comment297473> You can go to the site of the manufacturer of the camera. If there is a specific cable and a specific software for the iPhone, then you can. Otherwise you can't.
