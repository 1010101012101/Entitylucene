How do you turn off the "Try the new Safari" notification? <body> In OS X Yosemite and OS X El Capitan, when starting Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, there is an invasive, annoying, and persistent notification, titled "Try the new Safari."  There is only two options in the notification.  Clicking on "Later" will have the same notification come back next time, and "Try now"… well, I dislike being forced to do things on my emown/em computer.  This notification reminds me of the annoying popups coming in another famous operating system, Microsoft Windows, and this is one of the many reasons why I am not using it anymore.  ul liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkQTT.png" alt="Annoying notification"/li /ul  Is there any way to get the notification to not show up anymore without actually emtrying/em Apple's Safari?  <answer154184> I may have found a solution. Go to System Preferences, then notifications (first line), scroll down to Safari and disable "Safari alert style". Since I did that, it's stopped popping up...(then at least so far) Hope it'll help you.  <answer160074> You can get rid of it without giving in to Apple‘s desire for you to “Try Now”. Even if you click the button, they will ask you to change your default and may still ask again at a later time. I have explained it in much greater details on my blog but the gist of it are these three commands:  precodedefaults write com.apple.coreservices.uiagent CSUIHasSafariBeenLaunched -bool YES defaults write com.apple.coreservices.uiagent CSUIRecommendSafariNextNotificationDate -date 2050-01-01T00:00:00Z defaults write com.apple.coreservices.uiagent CSUILastOSVersionWhereSafariRecommendationWasMade -float 10.99 /code/pre  You must log out and in again for the change to apply. You should actually do it immediately to prevent the system from reverting the changes.  I also cover how to stop Safari from prompting you to become the default every few days. (epimorphic touched on this briefly.) Interesting if you need to use Safari on occasions for site-compatibility, testing, or whatever reason. (Oddly enough, I have not heard any automated browsing test suite authors complaining about this yet.)  <comment180789> ... you could just try it, once. <comment183436> I got the alert for the first time today after I restarted Chrome. I went and checked the setting you suggested but it is already set to "None" and all the other settings are all off too. Safari is in the bottom section under "Not In Notification Center" already. <comment187457> For those interested in editing the plist: Try http://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202292 under "Editing property lists" <comment188165> The notification comes from the UIAgent service (not listed in Notification Center) and not Safari itself. This will not work. <comment188236> Thanks. Incredible we have to come to that level of complexity to remove that annoyance. Does OS X take the Windows route? Great blog btw. <comment190110> Is setting `CSUIHasSafariBeenLaunched` to `YES` necessary for your method? Call me petty, but perhaps we could deny Apple even that miniscule victory :P <comment190727> @epimorphic it is actually not strictly required. It is just an extra measure to try and keep the thing from popping up again at a later time. <comment200205> Good answer. It still feels like complying though. You know? I'd want them to know that I did not try their shitty annoying browser, and not fake the value that checks if I did. <comment200387> @atrioom, try deleting Safari? I suspect that is measured somewhere and is the most effective signal. <comment200640> @Aeyoun I contacted Apple support in this matter, because I thought, if they hassle me with something like that, I at least bother them as long as I can with it, and maybe they even come up with a solution. Which they didn't! At first the guy suggested to actually try out the new Safari. When I ask how about deinstalling it he said he would not recommend it. At further inquiry he then said that 'since Safari is built into the system and is interwoven with everything, he strongly advises not to deinstall it'. <comment200657> @atrioom, you get the same warning when trying to uninstall the Chess.app. I doubt its _that_ interwoven. ;-) The arguments you were given sounds like those from Microsoft when asked by the European Commission to unbundle Internet Explorer from Windows. <comment200798> @Aeyoun You are right, but in fact I don't exactly know how interwoven it really is. I also never uninstalled IE on Win, and I am pretty sure I would've broken stuff. Not totally, not completely, but there would have been issues, I am sure. <comment233701> not working for me. cannot get rid of it <comment285504> This caused a major issue for my girlfriend and her computer illiterate mother. We used to use chrome remote desktop to help her with issues, now she accidentally switched to safari via this annoying popup its a been a pain to help her. <comment332187> This is absolutely astonishing user-hostility. Not that I haven't come to expect it from Apple, but their behaviour continues to shock me. <comment338234> @Ironman well the question asks how to disable the notification without using safari...
