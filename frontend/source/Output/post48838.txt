Mac Powerpoint 2011 "play" presentation w/out full screen? <body> I'm trying to play a presentation with Powerpoint without seeing it in full screen.  (my goal is to take notes on the presentation in a separate window/app).  Any ideas how to do this?  I want to be able to view the animations/transitions, which I don't get when viewing the powerpoint in edit mode  <answer48839> Just figured it out: use "Set Up Show" on the ribbon (or in the Slide Show menu), which has an option for "Browse by an individual (window)"  Hope that helps someone else :)
