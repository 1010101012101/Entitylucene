Can't install myEclipse on MacBook Pro with Yosemite <body> After updating to Yosemite, I find that I can't install myEclipse again.     Installation error:insufficient memory,zero virtual memory.   I also tried the codesysctl vm.swapusage/code command, the result is     vm.swapusage: total = 0.00M  used = 0.00M  free = 0.00M  (encrypted)`   Does anyone know the solution?  <answer154173> Download the installer again. MyElcipse 2015 CI 6 has been rebuilt to solve this problem.  <comment181196> How did you install Java (note the error message might be from Java and not the OS)
