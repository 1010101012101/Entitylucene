Problem with revealing a hidden folder <body> I have a problem. I used command codechflags hidden/code to hide a folder named code!_TRANSCODE/code. Now I'm trying to undo this by typing codechflags no hidden !_TRANSCODE/code and I get this error: code-bash: !_TRANSCODE: event not found/code  precodeLast login: Tue Nov 15 13:12:47 on ttys000 Marks-iMac:~ StefanCzapla$ cd /Volumes/THE_REASON_MASTER_1 Marks-iMac:THE_REASON_MASTER_1 StefanCzapla$ ls !_TRANSCODE 03.02.16 Stock Footage 02.23.16                03.03.16                The Reason VFX.zip 02.24.16                03.04.16                test 02.25.16                03.05.16                vfx 02.26.16                1,001 Sound FX          voiceover 02.27.16                Music 03.01.16                Project  Marks-iMac:THE_REASON_MASTER_1 StefanCzapla$ chflags nohidden !_TRANSCODE -bash: !_TRANSCODE: event not found Marks-iMac:THE_REASON_MASTER_1 StefanCzapla$  /code/pre  Any help appreciated!  <answer261195> You should escape the code!/code.  Try:  precodechflags nohidden \!_TRANSCODE /code/pre  code!/code is a special character to bash, it is used to refer to previous commands.
