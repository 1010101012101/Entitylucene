Is my system vulnerable to Apple's new password-in-clear-text bug? <body>    With the latest Lion security update, Mac OS X 10.7.3, Apple has accidentally turned on a debug log file outside of the encrypted area that stores the user’s password in clear text.   How can I determine whether my system if affected by this issue? If so, can I work around it, and also determine which users’ passwords have been exposed?  <answer50640> As stated in the article linked in the question:     Anyone who used FileVault encryption on their Mac prior to Lion, upgraded to Lion, but kept the folders encrypted using the legacy version of FileVault is vulnerable. FileVault 2 (whole disk encryption) is unaffected.   The password shows up in code/var/log/secure.log/code. To look for it, log in as an Administrator, open Terminal.app and run  precodesudo grep -i passwordAsUTF8String /var/log/secure.log /code/pre  Have a look at the result (if any) to see whether passwords appear in plain text.  hr  For additional information see  ul liApple update to OS X Lion exposes encryption passwords/li liApple Legacy Filevault Hole/li /ul  <comment58017> And if my significant other doesn't really remember what he did on his laptop, how can I confirm if it is affected or not? <comment58021> Is FileVault enabled for his home directoy (have a look System Preferences)? <comment58022> Yes, FileVault is enabled. How do I know if it was migrated and kept to a legacy version?
