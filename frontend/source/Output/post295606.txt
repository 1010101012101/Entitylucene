Recover accidentally deleted files from iCloud <body> Is there a way to recover files deleted from iCloud if an offline iPad still has them locally?  Would renaming the local files on the iPad prevent them from being deleted once the iPad is synced?  <answer295621> You could simply login to iCloud.com to recover that file. Under strongiCloud Settings/strong (by clicking your name in the top-right corner) you will find a section named strongAdvanced/strong. Simply click codeRestore Files/code under strongAdvanced/strong to open the Recently Deleted File browser.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TeH6e.png" alt="iCloud Advanced Settings"  <answer295756> I was able to recover the files by first of all renaming them on the iPad to prevent accidentally syncing the deletion and then following the iTunes document transfer procedure as described on the Apple support page:     ol   liOpen Numbers on your device, then do one of the following:      ul   liIf the spreadsheet is open: Tap the More button img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jqnlz.png" alt="enter image description here", then tap Send a Copy./li   liIf the spreadsheet is closed: Tap Share button img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qauym.png" alt="enter image description here" in the spreadsheet manager, tap Send a   Copy, then tap the spreadsheet you want to transfer./li   /ul/li   liTap the spreadsheet format you want to export: Numbers, PDF, Excel, or CSV./li   liTap iTunes./li   liConnect your iOS device to your computer (or use iTunes Wi-Fi Sync),   then open iTunes on your computer.
