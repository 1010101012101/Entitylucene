How to get pass "Downloading Windows support software" in Boot Camp Assistant? <body> I am having a problem in my Windows laptop, so I need to make a Windows 10 bootable to repair/restore it.  I am using  a Mac for making the bootable for the PC. I downloaded the windows 10 .iso file and started bootcamp to make the bootable. The process seems to get hanged at "Downloading Windows support software" step.  I tried keeping it overnight, no change in the progress bar. Just stuck there at 50/60%.  <answer220077> The problem got solved by formatting the disk.   I formatted the disk first in FAT format. Then the Boot Camp Assistant worked easily.   <comment266282> Why are you using Bootcamp to fix a 'real' Windows install? Why not just get the [media creation tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO) [page opens a different location depending on what OS you visit it with] & use that
