'script' command in terminal, looking for a flush open <body> When I use 'script' on a unix terminal the -f option flushes the data straight to the file - from the man page "-f      Flush output after each write. This is nice for telecooperation: One person does codemkfifo foo; script -f foo' and another can              supervise real-time what is being done using/codecat foo'."   This is a really handy option for me - but the version of the script command on my mac appears to be lacking this option. Are there any ways I can achieve the functionality?   <answer38515> You can achieve more or less the same result by running  precodescript -t 0 /code/pre  From the man page:  precode-t time  Specify time interval between flushing script output file.          A value of 0 causes script to flush for every          character I/O event.  The default interval is 30 seconds. /code/pre  <comment43593> Can't you achive the same result with `script -t 0`?
