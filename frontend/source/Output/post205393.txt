Default System Sound Location <body> I'm looking for some of the sounds that come default on OS X, like the preferences lock/unlock:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPAVQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I basically just want to copy the sound files onto my desktop.  <answer205397> All sounds are .aiff and you'll find many by going to:  Mcintosh HDsystemlibrarycomponents  Then right click on CoreAudio.component and click 'show package contents'  Then go into ContentsResourcesSystemSoundsfinder  Note that this is different in El Capitan but is what I used in several OS's before, ie: Yosemite, Maverick, etc  <comment247665> The question already has an answer here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/10941/60998 <comment247688> Note that my answer is a different location than is stated in the previous question/answer. <comment256896> @alexis - that's not what i'm asking. <comment256897> i couldn't find the the lock sound anywhere in there, so it must be someplace else. if you can put the full file path (including the name of the lock sound file) in your answer that might be more helpful. thanks <comment256910> that's all i know, sorry. <comment256926> What's the difference? Please clarify, because it seems like exactly the same question-- and not only to me, I'm sure.
