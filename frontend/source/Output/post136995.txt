Macbook Cursor does not show <body> My daughter's Macbook Air does not show a Cursor, although âŒ˜+Tab shows it. How do I force it to display normally?  <answer137006> Try following troubleshooting steps:  1 - Start in Safe mode (reboot, hold kbdshift/kbd right after the startup chime)  if cursor shows then it is a 3party software  2 - Log in as other user (Guest)  if cursor shows it is your (daughters) user profile that needs fixing  If none of above worked, it is your Trackpad app that needs fixing.  <comment162661> Could you expand on what you mean by "trackpad app"? <comment162669> (First time I noticed)... does alt-tab show a hand or another cursor? <comment162673> Literature: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1248, or http://osxdaily.com/2013/07/19/disappearing-mouse-cursor-mac-os-x/.... <comment162674> I'm not seeing any reference to a "trackpad app" anywhere within either articles. Could you clarify what you are referring to, preferably with a quote? Also, Safe Mode does not rule out 3rd-party app involvement as apps can still be run in Safe Mode.
