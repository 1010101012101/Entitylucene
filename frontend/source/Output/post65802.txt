Which php.ini file do I have to edit on Mountain Lion? <body> I recently upgraded to Mountain Lion and reconfigured my apache2 (codehttps.conf/code) file in the terminal to load PHP and start automatically.    My codelocalhost/~username/phpinfo.php/code page comes up to show my PHP configuration (codephp.ini/code).  I see that codeupload_files/code is set to ON and the codemax_size_upload/code is set to 20MB.  However, the codeupload_tmp_dir/code isn't set (it says NO VALUE).  I assume the default tmp directory is "/tmp".    When I do   precode$ cd /etc/ $ sudo nano php.ini.default  /code/pre  goto the codeupload_tmp_dir/code and I remove the code;/code in front of it and enter the value code/tmp/code (save and exit).  I still see NO VALUE for the codeupload_tmp_dir/code when I load my codephpinfo.php/code.  I just wonder if I'm doing something wrong.  Any help is appreciated.  <answer65805> code/etc/php.ini.default/code serves only as a reference and is not read out by PHP at all. The built-in PHP installation will look for the file code/etc/php.ini/code instead. This file is not present by default, but you can copy code/etc/php.ini.default/code to code/etc/php.ini/code and make your modifications in there. You could also just create an empty file and only add any directives you want to change from the default.  Make sure you copy or create the file as root, so in Terminal you could do:  codesudo cp /etc/php.ini.default /etc/php.ini/code  After modifying the php.ini, also make sure you restart Apache for the settings to take effect.  It is good practice to not modify code/etc/php.ini.default/code directly, so you can use it as a reference if anything goes wrong with your code/etc/php.ini/code.  <answer172200> If you have multiple installations of php, then you should use the php command to find the ini files.   precode$ /usr/local/opt/php56/bin/php --ini Configuration File (php.ini) Path: /usr/local/etc/php/5.6 Loaded Configuration File:         /usr/local/etc/php/5.6/php.ini Scan for additional .ini files in: /usr/local/etc/php/5.6/conf.d Additional .ini files parsed:      (none) /code/pre  <comment77402> Did you restart apache after changing the setting? I.E. Turn off/on web sharing (i think?) in sys prefs?
