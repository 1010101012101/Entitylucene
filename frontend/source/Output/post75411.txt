How to disable concurrent user login on Mountain Lion Server? <body> I just finished (after trying 10 Times) to set up a Mountain Lion Server on a Mac mini. We have only 10 network users with their home directory served from the server and a Drobo 5D.   For reasons unknown, the box to enable simultaneous login has no effect when I toggle it under Workgroup Manager.  Anyone has an idea why and/or could tell me if there is a command line option to change all users at once?
