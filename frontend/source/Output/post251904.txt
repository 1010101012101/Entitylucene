Hacking. Setoolkit for mac <body> Few days ago I was trying to download the too famous Social Engineering ToolKit. After investigating I saw that the best option was writing this command in my terminal:  precodegit clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit cd social-engineer-toolkit python setup.py /code/pre  After doing this I got surprised for two things. The first time I tried to do It was a simple mistake because I didn't know that I had to install a Python interpreter the second time after installing the interpreter the machine displayed this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UK1GJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does someone has an idea for solving this?
