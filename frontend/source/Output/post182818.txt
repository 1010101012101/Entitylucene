MAC Filtering in Internet Sharing <body> How can I enable MAC Filtering on my MAC OSX 10.9.4? I tried adding  precode&lt;key&gt;allow&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt; &lt;string&gt;0:17:43:a3:2d:45&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  to my code/etc/bootpd.plist/code, but every time I change it and start Internet Sharing again, it gets replaced again. How can I change this permanently?  <answer182820> Have a look at this method I used for many years on codeLion/code and codeMountain Lion/code: How to stop InternetSharing overwriting /etc/bootpd.plist  Since the culprit is still codeInternetSharing/code overwriting a standard configuration file, the method should work.  <comment217764> Thank you very much! However, I am a total noob, can you explain this a bit closer? 'I replaced the original bootpd by a simple shell script in charge of putting my source of /etc/bootpd.plist in place before firing the original bootpd code. ' - how would I do this? <comment217775> Alright so the code renames the original /usr/libexec/bootpd, and then puts your script in its place? And then I just start internet sharing normally? <comment217778> Also there is a typo: cat bootpd.plist/src eof should be cat bootpd.plist.src eof right? <comment217795> I need some more help with it. Do you have some more time for me? I copied your code for bootpd.plist.src from the other question and added the mac address of the device I wanted. However, it doesn't get any connection. So I removed the allow key and the array again, but still no device will connect to the wifi now. What else do I have to watch out for? Also, I accidentally deleted my backup of /usr/libexec/bootpd.orig, so I can't revert back now. Any ideas would be highly appreciated. <comment217884> "This is not a bug, this is a feature". The objective I imagine behind this systematic overwriting is to avoid users to temper with this file. To let users edit this `/etc/bootpd.plist` would have needed some documentation writing and some tools to check its syntax before starting `bootpd`. This is a lot of work, a lot of support. <comment217916> I got it working now, thanks a lot for your help. <comment217918> Thank you for your feedback. I will add this information in my original post. Actually I don't have any Mac running Mavericks at hand.
