Applescript code to find path to Desktop picture in Desktop 2 <body> I need an applescript that will find the path to the desktop picture used in Desktop 2. As this isn't the current desktop the code below doesn't work.  precodetell application "Finder"     set DesktopPath to desktop picture as string end tell /code/pre  Is there anyway to easily automatically find the path to the picture in desktop 2?  runnning el capitan   <answer231608> This works for me:  precodetell application "System Events" set tlst to a reference to every desktop --set picture of item 1 of tlst to newtop  -- display 1 --set picture of item 2 of tlst to newtop -- display 2 set z to (picture of item 2 of tlst) as text end tell return z /code/pre  The commented out lines are for setting desktop pic on one display or the other. newtop is obviously preset, or the result of  precodeset newtop to choose file /code/pre  <comment282840> System Events got an error: Canâ€™t get item 2 of every desktop. Invalid index. I seem to get this error? <comment282843> I'm not seeing that error. OS X 10.11.3 Script Editor 2.81 AppleScript 2.5  Have you got the "set z..." bit inside your tell block? I can get errors similar to what you describe if I move that line outside the tell. <comment282845> The code is copied as is. I'm checking on another computer atm. Edit: On another computer with the exact script it comes up with the same error. <comment282847> I recall possibly seeing this script to be used for different desktops on different monitors. The desktops I mean are the ones with numbers when pressing f3 next to the dashboard.
