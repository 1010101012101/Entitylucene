Use whereis can not find the file in the Mac <body> In the Mac I installed the mysqlclient, use codewhereis/code can not find the codemysql_config/code, but use codewhich/code I can find, why use the codewhereis/code can not find it?   precodeaircraftdeMacBook-Pro:bin ldl$ whereis mysql_config aircraftdeMacBook-Pro:bin ldl$ which mysql_config /usr/local/mysql/bin//mysql_config /code/pre  <answer287468> whereis uses a hardcoded list of paths to search. which uses your PATH.  /usr/local/mysql/bin isn't a standard location for binaries, so whereis doesn't search there. Presumably you've added that folder to your path (or the installer did), which means when which searches through your path folders, it finds it.  You can print the list of paths whereis searches by running the following:  precode$ sysctl user.cs_path user.cs_path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  Whereas your $PATH will generally have many more components. You can print your PATH with:  precode$ echo $PATH /code/pre  <comment362969> If I add the `/usr/local/mysql/bin` in the $PATH use `export`, if I can use `whereis` to search mysql_config? <comment362970> @aircraft which uses the path, not whereis. <comment362971> yep, I understand, thank you.
