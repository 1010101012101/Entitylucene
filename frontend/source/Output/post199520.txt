Suspended (tty output) when launching editors like vim, vi, emacs, or nano <body> I've been using Oh-My-ZSH for a few weeks now and it's been a great experience. Just today, though, terminal started acting strangely. When I try to run an interactive terminal editor like codevim/code, codevi/code, codeemacs/code, or codenano/code, the process is suspended:  precode$ vim [1] + 3515 suspended (tty output) vim /code/pre  Of course, I can open it back up with codefg/code, but this is incredibly annoying.  I wasn't experiencing this issue yesterday. Since then I haven't restarted my computer, iTerm, or even closed terminal tabs (from which I successfully ran vim yesterday without it being suspended).  Additionally, I temporarily reverted my shell back to bash. It now exhibits this same suspending behavior as ZSH. This problem occurs both in iTerm2 and the native osx Terminal.app for both bash and zsh, so presumably this isn't an issue with my shell.  I've been through every solution on the first 10 pages of Google for this issue, but haven't found one that resolves it. I'm approaching the point where I no longer understand why this is happening and therefore can't debug it.  Is there any way that I can get interactive processes like codevim/code to stop suspending themselves when I try to run them from terminal?  emEdit:/em Since this post I've tried new iTerm &amp; Terminal tabs, relaunched iTerm &amp; Terminal, and restarted my computer. All of these have failed to resolve this issue.  <answer199522> Terminal is suspending the editor because some other process is writing to the terminal.  Running codestty -tostop/code emshould/em fix it.  If that does not fix the problem, take a look at this GitHub issue from the codeoh-my-zsh/code repository.     the issue results from a setting code:set shellcmdflag=-ic/code. After I comment[ed] that out from code.vimrc/code all relevant problems were solved.   Other users have evidently run into this problem. This seems to be the correct solution.  <answer199537> Turns out I misread the first result on Google. I incorrectly assumed that they were referring to the terminal shell (and when they said codeshell/code later on I assumed they meant code$SHELL/code, although I should've been tipped off by the fact that codeshell/code wasn't capitalized). Instead they were referring to the vim shell setting, which incorrectly had the code-i/code flag instead of the code-l/code flag.  So in case anyone else has this issue, go into your code.vimrc/code and change make sure the line that sets your codeshell/code looks like this:  precodeset shell=/bin/zsh\ -l /code/pre  (Replacing code/bin/zsh/code with the value of codewhich zsh/code if it's installed in a non-standard location, of course).

Unfortunately, I've tried running `stty -tostop`, but subsequent attempts to run vim (or nano, vi, emacs, etc.) are still suspended. `ps a` reveals that the only things running are `login -fp` and `-zsh` (and as I understand it `login` launches `-zsh`). Is it possible that something else is running that I can't see which is writing to the terminal? <comment240214> In your question, you said that you haven't restarted your computer, nor closed any Terminal windows/tabs. If this is still the case, try both of those. @PhpMyCoder <comment240216> From the time running `vim` last worked until today when it started suspending, I hadn't restarted my computer/iTerm or closed any terminal tabs. I have now done all 3 and yet vim still continues to be suspended. Sorry for the confusion, I'll reword the question. <comment240271> I've modified my answer. @PhpMyCoder
