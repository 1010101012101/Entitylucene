How can I repeat a video at slow playback speed? <body> Is there any way to repeat a video while it's playing in slow motion?  I tried using both QuickTime and VLC. I don't see a way to control the playback speed in QuickTime, and the problem with VLC is that when the video replays, it loses the playback speed setting.   <answer10465> You can do this with QuickTime 7. Grab a copy off the Mac OS X Install DVD.  Go Window- AV Controls and change the playback speed. (Or something with a similar name) brThen View- Loop for repeating.  <answer76273> Option-clicking the forward button increases playback speed by 0.1. Clicking the backward button plays videos in reverse though. You can set the rate between 0 and 1 by running this in AppleScript Editor:  precodetell application "QuickTime Player" to set rate of document 1 to 0.8 /code/pre  In Movist you can press ⇧⌘← or adjust the slider in the control HUD.  <comment11747> This works. The only problem is that the slowest it can go is 1/2 speed. <comment43094> VLC should be able to do this.  Have you tried to choose "Slower" from the "Playback" menu?
