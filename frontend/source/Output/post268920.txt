Only able to import small number of photos from iPhone to Mac <body> I'm trying to import all photos from my iPhone to my MacBook. The iPhone shows there are 1,879 photos ("All photos" album). Connecting the iPhone to the Mac using a USB cable and using Image Capture. IC only shows 539 photos available for import. I've also tried importing using Lightroom, which only sees the same 539 photos.  Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3rOTl.png" alt="iPhone" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l1jU8.png" alt="Image Capture"  <comment337768> Have you gone to Albums  Recently Deleted to make sure it has been emptied.  I'm not sure, though, if images in this album are counted towards the total. <comment337769> Thanks but "Recently Deleted" album is empty. I can see photos on the iPhone that simply no not appear is Image Capture (or any other tool I've tried). <comment337835> Do you have iCloud Photo Library, My Photo Stream and/or iCloud Photo Sharing enabled? (Settings  iCloud  Photos) <comment337904> Yes, iCloud Photo Library and iCloud Photo Sharing are turned on. Do you consider this something that could cause the problem? <comment337905> Noticed the 'Optimise iPhone Storage' option was enabled and when changing it to 'Download and Keep Originals' was presented with a message that there's not enough space on the iPhone. I'm guessing the optimise versions of the photos do not appear when trying to export from the iPhone. <comment337906> Looks like I've have to download all photos from iCloud instead.
