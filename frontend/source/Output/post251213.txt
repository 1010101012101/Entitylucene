Missing scaled resolution for external 4K display on MacBook 2016 <body> I'm running my MacBook 2016 attached to LG 27MU67-B operating fine in native 4K resolution. But the choices for scaled (DPI)resolution are somewhat broken.  In display preferences pane I'm presented scaled resolution setting choices as follows:  ul li3840 x 2160/li li1920 x 1080/li li1680 x 945/li liand more useless resolutions./li /ul  I'm currently forced to use 1920x1080 which results on a ridiculously zoomed in UI. The highest resolution is native resolution which is a bit too small to work with. With a MacBookPro 2012 I get a 2400-something resolution, which is not available on the MacBook. Is this limit imposed by the MacBook hardware ? Or is it possible to activate more higher resolutions than 1920x1080 but lower than 3840 x 2160 with a codedefaults write/code trick ?  This is a screenshot of my currently possible settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pfYNG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer251220> Select the highest resolution and then alt-click the emScaled/em radio-button. You can then select scaling of the UI: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uYrUc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment312304> I switched to the drop down list of scaled resolutions to illustrate my choices. Switching back to _simple selection mode_ does not change the outcome. It is still 3840x2160 or 1920x1080 and nothing in-between. <comment312307> It is not a simple selection mode but rather a scaling of the UI that uses the selected resolution. So you can use the highest resolution without having to look at microscopic UI elements. <comment313078> I am aware of that. I'm running the native 4k resolution suitable for the monitor.  But I don't get the choice for specific scaled UI (More Space) resolutions. Please re-read the question if you care. <comment328656> I read somewhere online (don't have a source) that 10.12.1 fixed this for some people. Can you comment on that? <comment328704> Nope. I can not really comment on the old setup, since I returned the HDMI Dongle and switched to another brand (Anker). 10.12.1 was released before I had the new dongle. But now I have 2560x1440 available plus some more. So maybe yes 10.12.1 fixes this issue, maybe no. <comment328764> Thanks, it's helpful to know that the adapter can be a limitation <comment329097> Well even that is not known. Maybe the old adaptor is running better with 10.12.1... It was already returned before I upgraded.
