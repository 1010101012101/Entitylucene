iMac 5k 2017 4k Video (mkv) playback with VLC stutter badly <body> Video : http://4ksamples.com/elysium-2013-2160p-1-minute-sample-footage/   +  iMac 5k 2017 Core i5 Turbo 4.1Ghz  +  VLC 2.2.5.1   Result = video playback stutter badly.  Is this expected?  Any other software recommended ?  <comment362167> From your link - "*NOTE* This file is encoded using x265 and will require a player such as MPC-BE to play them, It will not work in VLC." <comment362169> Tested working in [Elmedia Player](https://mac.eltima.com/media-player.html) (free, but nags to go Pro) <comment362174> elmedia player works great for this. thanks!  hopefully vlc will improve in the next months.. <comment362615> actually it is still stuttering, not very pleasant to watch, but watchable. and have to postpone buying 5K iMac until Elmedia/VLC/Hardware get much better.
