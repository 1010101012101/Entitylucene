Section Breaks in Pages <body> I am trying to format a book in Pages.  I am having trouble using section breaks.  Can I add a section break without it adding two additional pages to a manuscript?  <comment123546> If I understand you well, you want a section break without a page break ? <comment123720> Yes.  I am trying to format the book so the chapters do not have to many blank pages between them.
