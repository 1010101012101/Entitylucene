Not getting new voice mail after switched iphones/sim card <body> I switched iphones from a 5c to a 5s - both on AT&amp;T. Got a new SIM card from AT&amp;T store.  The Contacts and strongold/strong voicemails are all there and I can dial out as well as receive calls.  However strongnew/strong voicemails are nowhere to be seen.  How can this be corrected?  The phone is on ios 10.2 .  <answer291275> Ring your provider - sounds like something needs to be switched over from their end.br [I've had similar happen with an updated SIM, same phone, same number.]  <comment367757> Yes AT&T needed to update the imieo (or something like that)
