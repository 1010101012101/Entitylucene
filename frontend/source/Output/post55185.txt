Is it necessary to disconnect the battery when installing new RAM in the early 2011 MacBook Pro? <body> I want to install additional RAM to my early 2011 MacBook Pro.  I originally was only looking at the official Apple guide, but then while searching for a better screwdriver I found the iFixit guide, which tells you to disconnect the battery.  Is this necessary? Apple's guide doesn't mention it.  <answer55196> I just did it without disconnecting the battery and it works fine, so disconnecting the battery is not needed.  <answer55383> In case your computer is really shut down it's not necessary since memory is not powered.  I believe ifixit instruction tend to be on safe side: for example this one is just to be sure that memory is really not powered and computer not just in sleep mode accidentally.
