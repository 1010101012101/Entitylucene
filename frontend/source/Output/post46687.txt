Has coreaudiod been fixed in Lion yet? <body> I tried Lion a few months ago, but had to revert to 10.6 because of the "coreaudiod bug" – where audio via QuickTime would stop working every few minutes, requiring a codekillall coreaudiod/code each time. Since I'm a video editor, this would interfere with Final Cut and After Effects, making Lion unusable.  Does anyone know if this issue has been fixed yet in Lion?  <answer60666> Nope it hasn't. I'm still having problems in Logic because of it. I plug in a headphone cable, unplug it, and suddenly the computer doesn't have sound. Try codekillall /usr/sbin/coreaudiod/code then relaunch it, I get this:  precode[...] Error: FIXME: IOUnserialize has detected a string that is not valid UTF-8, "?-8?????-8????PDa????@Da????0??????Ԕ?????&lt;????????c".

If USB, it may be that the USB I/O driver for your headphone is causing the problem. Many I/O drivers for core audio (and all hardware devices) run within the kernel.  A bug in the driver can cause problems with the driver manager code (coreaudiod, in this case) or even potentially the entire kernel.  Is it only with one specific headphone and/or one specific USB type output device?  If its USB (and not line-out), try a different USB connector type (different brand) to see if the same problem arises.  If its line-out, I have no idea what the problem might be.  <answer71314> Nope.  Actually I have consistently had problems with coreaudiod spawning ports and generally causing the system to hang since 10.6.0  <comment53451> I don't know if that specific issue has been fixed but there are a whole bunch of issues fixed with coreaudio in 10.7.4 -- I only know this because because I'm doing some beta testing of 10.7.4 and some pro-audio interface devices now *specifically* to see if 10.7.4 issues ae finally gone. If you have an Apple Developer ID you can download 10.7.4 and try it out, see if your issue is no longer present. <comment78895> Is there a reliable way to reproduce this?  Is it specific to some particular hardware? <comment83376> This question is garnering lots of bad answers since the question doesn't refer to a specific bug ( has one even been filed ? ) or a sequence of steps to cause the issue.
