Signed but still can't open <body> A colleague of mine signed an application we're working on. Trying to open it from finder, I get an error message     “‹Name›” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer   (or the local translation of this). On console I read  precodeCoreServicesUIAgent[‹pid›]: Error -60005 creating authorization /code/pre  But if I run codesign on the code, it seems to check out just fine:  precode$ codesign -vv . .: valid on disk .: satisfies its Designated Requirement /code/pre  So it seems the bundle got signed correctly. To get more details:  precode$ codesign -dvv . Executable=… Identifier=… Format=app bundle with Mach-O universal (i386 x86_64) CodeDirectory v=20200 size=440 flags=0x0(none) hashes=8+3 location=embedded Signature size=4731 Authority=3rd Party Mac Developer Application: ‹Name› (‹TeamID›) Authority=Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority Authority=Apple Root CA Signed Time=21.07.2016, ‹Time› Info.plist entries=25 TeamIdentifier=‹TeamID› Sealed Resources version=2 rules=12 files=1164 Internal requirements count=1 size=208 /code/pre  So from the codeAuthority=/code lines I'd conclude that the certificate chain could be verified as well, and it does lead back to Apple. strongHow is that “unidentified”?/strong  From this post I learned about codespctl/code, but it doesn't provide much information either:  precode$ spctl --assess -vvvv . .: rejected origin=3rd Party Mac Developer Application: ‹Name› (‹TeamID›) /code/pre  strongHow can I get more information as to why emexactly/em the app fails to load?/strong  <answer246760> While formulating the question, I tried various combinations of keywords and eventually found Difference between “Mac Developer” and “3rd Party Mac Developer Application” on Stack Overflow, which led to developer documentation on Maintaining Certificates which in turn writes this:     ul   listrongType:/strong Mac App Distribution:br   strongName:/strong code3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Team Name/codebr   strongDescription:/strong Used to sign a Mac app before submitting it to the Mac App Store./li   listrongType:/strong Developer ID Application:br   strongName:/strong codeDeveloper ID Application: Team Name/codebr   strongDescription:/strong Used to sign a Mac app before distributing it outside the Mac App Store./li   /ul   So apparently this form of code signing is suitable only for submission for the App Store, but not for stand-alone distribution. That took quite a while to work out, so I hope this Q&amp;A will help others avoid that time.
