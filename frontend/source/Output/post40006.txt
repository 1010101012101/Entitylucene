How to restore PHP to the original configuration? <body> I did something wrong and now my PHP is not working anymore.  I'm using OS X Lion. I can I restore it to the original configuration?  <answer40008> There should be a code/etc/php.ini.default/code file that you can copy to codephp.ini/code.  <comment45249> I didn't have the `/etc/php.ini`. I did what you said but id doesn't work. If I try to open a php page in my Sites folder it shows me the code. Maybe it's a problem with apache? <comment45250> Look in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and make sure LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so is uncommented. <comment45251> I did it and it worked...however it was in `/private/etc/apache2`. Why do I have 2 versions? Is it normal the fact that if I go to `/localhost/~luca/phpmyadmin` it works but `/localhost/~luca/phpmyadmin/index.php` shows me the php code? <comment45252> 1) /etc is just a symlink to /private/etc. And 2) no it's not normal. Maybe browser cache? <comment45266> 2) Yes, it was! Thanks!
