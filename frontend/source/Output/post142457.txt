Create Code 128 Barcodes within Excel <body> I'm trying to create Code 128 Barcodes within Microsoft Excel. I have tried all VBA Makros and Fonts I found on Google, but none give's me a scannable result (usually there are weird characters like รณ's mixed in). Does anybody have a working solution?  <comment167828> Please consider editing your original question instead of asking a slightly different one. <comment167842> I thought I'll let the old one remain since the context is different and it seems it has been a non-existing question so far
