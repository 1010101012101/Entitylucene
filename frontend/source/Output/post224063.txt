Compose key with æ, ø, å <body> I need quick access to the Danish letters æ, ø, å while using the US keyboard-layout in OS X (I it slow to change keyboard layout all the time, my MBA has a Danish keyboard).  I want to use right-alt (option) as the compose key, so I can get "ø" by typing coder-alt/code-code//code-codeo/code and similar.  I have consulted an earlier question but it is not clear if this gives me access to the Danish letters and I don't have a Linux installation to get configuration files from.  Is there a another/newer/easier way to do it with Karabiner/Seil etc.?  <answer224070> The standard shortcuts in the US layout are alt plus ', alt plus o, alt plus a.  æøå.  Is there some reason these are not good for you?  (I guess if your keyboard is printed as Danish, the ' key would have ø printed on it)  <answer224078> To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.  In the example below holding the right option key enables the Danish keyboard layout. To type æ, ø, å just hold the right option key and use the original keys printed on your physical (Danish) keyboard. Releasing the right option key switches the layout back to en_US.  Prerequisites:  The US-English strongand/strong the Danish keyboard layout have to be enabled. The shortcut kbdcmd/kbdkbdspace/kbd mustn't be used elsewhere than "Switch to previous input source".  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Change input source temporarily&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;Change input source to Danish while you are holding down right option key.&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;remap.change_input_source_temporary_danish_option_r&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;         __KeyToKey__         KeyCode::OPTION_R,         KeyCode::VK_NONE,         Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_DANISH, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,         Option::KEYTOKEY_AFTER_KEYUP, KeyCode::SPACE, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,       &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the remapping.
