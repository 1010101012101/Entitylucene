How do I change the Default Alert Time? <body> On my iPod Touch, the Default Alert Time is 9 AM. This would be fine, as I can change it per event if necessary. But the time for birthdays cannot be changed as the birthdays are retrieved from my contacts and the event cannot be edited. Instead of manually creating each event for my contacts, how can I change the Default Alert Time?
