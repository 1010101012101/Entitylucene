AppleScript to create spacing format like "S P A C I N G"? <body> In order to format text documents in a more readable way it would be nice to format selected texts by an apple script executed via the context menu services in the following way:  ol liselect "text" with cursor/li liselect context menu/services Spacing (to be created)/li liselected text is going to be formated to "T E X T"/li /ol  Does anybody has the knowhow to program such a script?  <answer200053> h1AppleScript to Expand Text/h1  The following AppleScript snippet adds a space between each character of a string. Copy and paste this code in strongApplications  Utilities  Script Editor/strong to try it out:  precodeset myText to "hello world" set myResult to ""  repeat with c in every character in myText     set myResult to myResult &amp; " " &amp; c end repeat  display dialog myResult /code/pre  h1Automator Service/h1  Using this script, you can use strongApplications  Automator/strong to create your context menu service.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PCix0.png" alt="Automator workflow to expand selected text"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibEiu.png" alt="New text expand service in TextEdit"  ol liLaunch Automator.app/li liCreate a new workflow, select strongService/strong/li liAdd a strongRun AppleScript/strong action/li liCopy and paste in the script:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      set myText to input as string     set myResult to ""      repeat with c in every character in myText         set myResult to ((myResult &amp; " " &amp; c) as string)     end repeat      -- Convert to upper case using `tr`     set myResult to do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of (myResult) &amp; " | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]"      return myResult end run /code/pre/li liSelect strongOutput replaces selected text/strong/li liSave and test your new service/li /ol  <answer200078> To have the selected text converted to upper case, along with having a space added between each character, add the following line to the script posted by Graham Miln.  precodeset myResult to do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of (myResult) &amp; " | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]" /code/pre  So in strongAutomator/strong it would be:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      set myText to input as string     set myResult to ""      repeat with c in every character in myText         set myResult to ((myResult &amp; " " &amp; c) as string)     end repeat      set myResult to do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of (myResult) &amp; " | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]"      return myResult  end run /code/pre  <comment241025> Did you test this? I'm asking because this doesn't work for me in TextEdit  under OS X 10.8.5 and TextEdit under OSX 10.10.4. Or with or TextWrangler under OS X 10.8.5 the service doesn't show at all.  It's not a big deal for me as I have no reason to double-space text however what you've presented doesn't work on my systems. <comment241027> Thank you very much of your quick and fitting answer! I tried it, but the problem is, that the selected text isn't taken. If I set the myText to "asdkfsafg" it works perfect. If I use it with set myText to input I got error messages or the selected text gets deleted. The input parameter in Automator is Text and every program. What's going wrong? <comment241028> @user3439894, it seems to be that we have the same behavior <comment241029> @user139574 I tested the AppleScript on OS X 10.10.4 but not the service. What error message do you see? Have you tried creating other services using Automator? What happens if the service returns a static string such as `return "test"` instead of `return myResult`? <comment241030> The error message from text edit is (translated from german): the service ... is not working, because the service ... isn't providing valid data.  returning of a static string is working <comment241031> If a let the script output the input string just at the beginning it's correct. So it seam to be, that an incorrect data format is caused by "repeat with c in every character in myText         set myResult to myResult & " " & c     end repeat" make this sense <comment241034> I have updated the script; change the line `set myText to input as string`. The `as string` appears to be required. I have also typecast the `myResult` concatenation to ensure it remains a string type. This now works on OS X 10.10.4 as a service. <comment241036> Yes,   i t ' s   w o r k i n g  ;-) One final question: What's the command to switch all letters to upper case? <comment241045> @Graham Miln, It's Working now for me in three differen't apps I'd use it in if I had a need.  While I don't have a need for this particular scenario nonetheless I've taken something useful away with me, so +1 here. <comment241046> @user139574 converting strings to uppercase with AppleScript is discussed here: http://www.mindingthegaps.com/blog/2011/05/26/applescript-converting-uppercase-lowercase-applescrunix-style/ <comment241062> You can also just increase the letter spacing. <comment241106> Thank you for this suggestion. I have incorporated your `tr` line into the script. <comment241114> @Graham Miln, No problem. I would have edited your answer directly however because it can be done in a number of ways I decided to post it as a separate answer since you only addressed the OP's upper case portion of his query as a link in a comment to your answer.
