On OS X, what is the difference between /Library/ and /System/Library/? <body> I hope the Title question says it all. There are two 'Library' directories in my OS X 10.11 installation, one being /Library/, the other being /System/Library/. What is there difference between those?  Thanks!  <answer262591> As in all the Unix system, there are two type of codelib/code folder. One specific for the user and the other for the entire system and so all the users of the machine.   In particular for OS X: the Macintosh HD version is the actual computer Library, while, the home folder version is specific to your user account.  hr  Here an example to help you understand how to use it:   code/System/Library/code is a place to store fonts, screen savers, Dashboard widgets, and all other things that all local users need access to.  code~home/Library/code is for your own user account only (cache and preference files, widgets for your use only, etc).  hr  EDIT: taken from here, a complete overview of all the possible library folders in a Mac OS X system:   ul liThe user library, ~/Library, stores per-user settings etc./li liThe local library, /Library, stores computer-wide settings etc. I call this the "local" library, because in NextStep it was /Local/Library, but you'll see all sorts of other names for it, such as the root library, computer library, .../li liThe network library, /Network/Library would store settings shared by all computers in a network domain -- if a network domain admin set one up, which nobody does anymore.../li liThe system library, /System/Library, stores the base settings, resources, etc that come with OS X. In theory, you shouldn't change anything in here./li /ul  <comment328961> Thanks, but what I meant was that there is one _Library_ directory in the root directory (/Library/), and another _Library_ directory in the _System_ directory, which itself is in the root directory (/System/Library/). I'm aware that there is a third _Library_ directory in the user's directory, /Users/_username_/Library/, but this is not what I meant. <comment328962> @AlexIxeras in that case take a look at this complete answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14286571/what-does-mac-os-library-folder-store <comment328963> Thanks for the link. That's what I was looking for. <comment355715> To be a bit more specific, "/Library is for all-users content" according to [this comment at reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/4egoz1/so_basically_there_is_library_and_systemlibrary/d1zymlw/), and that seems right.
