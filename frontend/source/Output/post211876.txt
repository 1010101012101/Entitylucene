Lost all email composed and sent while in airplane mode <body> I just returned from an international flight that did not feature wifi access. While my iPhone was in airplane mode, I replied to a number of email messages attached to my exchange account and sent them while offline.   Once landed and connected back to my cellular network, I realized that there was no trace of the sent messages or replies; neither in Drafts, Outbox nor the Sent Items folder.   A quick Google search indicates that this may have been an issue in the past. Are those messages simply lost at this point?  <comment255838> Exchange uses a temp folder called "outbox" they may be stuck there. Typically pressing Send puts the message in Outbox, and when it's actually been sent then it moves from Outbox to Sent. <comment255839> I'll clarify: There was nothing in _Outbox_ either.
