Can I set Hide Sidebar as default in Preview <body> codePreview/code has become rather annoying. I found a post to Hide Sidebar https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/213395/19086  Even worse, if I select codeFull Screen/code mode I get Sidebar plus 2 pages side by side (which actually makes the document smaller and harder to read). Can I stop this?  <answer214206> In Full Screen you can hide the sidebar by unselecting ViewAlways Show Sidebar (shortcut kbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbd1/kbd):   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlpLH.png" alt="enter image description here"  To get rid of the side by side view you need to select ViewSingle Page (shortcut kbdcommmand/kbdkbd2/kbd) instead of ViewTwo Pages:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxO0m.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yXvJx.png" alt="enter image description here"
