Parallels - Can I have a keyboard shortcut for the context-menu key found on Wintel hardware? <body> On a lot of Windows keyboards there's a key to the right of the spacebar that brings up the context-menu (right-click menu) in applications (I'm running Win7). I can't seem to find a way to map this function to the VM's keyboard in Parallels. Is it even possible?  <answer32942> emFor Bootcamp I'm using AutoHotkey app as a way to remap standard Windows keyboard switch combination to kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd./em  I've just tried to remap right command key of my Apple Aluminum keyboard to become Context menu key and it works with editing AutoHotkey.aht configuration file  and adding      RWin::AppsKey   as a key binding. You may read more on remapping with AutoHotKey here. And here is a list of key names.   Also, in Windows, kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdF10/kbd should act as a context menu shortcut but I can't attest since my F10 key is not working and I'm too lazy to boot into Windows again and remap it just to test it.)  <comment91311> +1 for the Shift + F10. That seems to work for the most part, depending on what control has focus. Thanks. <comment152311> Shift + F10 works great!
