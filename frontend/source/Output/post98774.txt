How do I cat a deleted file which is still open by its inode? <body> I have deleted a file I still have open. I want to save that file. I know its inode number.  I think that sleuthtools codeicat/code would work for me except for the following.  code$ sudo icat -f hfs /dev/disk0s2 3720257 &gt; /path/to/some_new_filename/code  precodeError opening image file (raw_open: file "/dev/disk0s2" - Resource busy) /code/pre  <answer98858> Since the block disk code/dev/disk0s2/code is in use by the Kernel, use the raw disk:  /dev/rdisk0s2
