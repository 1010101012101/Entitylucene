Textmate's Filter Through Command <body> I run anything there on document or selection I get      /bin/sh: pandoc: command not found   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1VEMX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I installed pandoc by codebrew install pandoc/code  My pandoc's version is 1.13.2.1.   There is probably something broken in my $PATH.  Echo $PATH gives code/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/texbin/code.   Both my $HOME/.profile and $HOME/.bashrc have codeexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8/code only.  Doing codels -1 /bin/sh/code gives code/bin/sh/code so existing.  Why does this error message come?   <answer187570> Solution here.  Click the box in settings for $PATH  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6oVNj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment221750> It's `pandoc` which is not found, not `sh`. What does `type padoc` return in Terminal? <comment221751> I get `type pandoc pandoc is hashed (/usr/local/bin/pandoc)` from `type pandoc`.
