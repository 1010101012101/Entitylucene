Is there a way to use my iPhone 5's unlimited data on my iPad mini Wi-Fi without the expensive hotspot option? <body> I am grand-fathered in the AT&amp;T unlimited data.  I sometimes like to stream Netflix, Hulu, etc while on lunch break.  Is there a way to airplay it over to my iPad mini, or do some type of internet sharing without paying the ridiculous data rates for sharing and AT&amp;T?  <answer73336> There have been hacks in the past to enable tethering, but in almost all cases, the carrier can tell what you are doing. I have even heard that people that tethered were individually contacted by AT&amp;T to let them know that the tethering fee would be added if they wished to continue tethering and asked the customers to come in to chat if there were perhaps a misunderstanding.  You'll want to look for an unofficial AirPlay receiver app on the jailbreak side of things since Apple isn't even allowing these for solid commercial sound apps - let alone video apps.  Long term - let's hope enough people push for network neutrality in the US cellular space so that there is one tariff for data based on volume - not how you intend to use that data.  <answer98379> Yes. Buy an ipad mini from verizon.  Then go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKRPkeH0-Ic  and he'll tell you how to do it. :D  <comment85220> Bottom line.  Cell phone companies SUCK.  SUUUCK.  Why can't Google, Microsoft, FaceBook, and about 10 giant companies through in a few $B each and create their own unlimited, super highspeed, free wireless service?  Seriously.  What would $10B be to Google and MS?  They are services companies anyway.  lol <comment115484> You should provide the basic steps in your answer instead of only linking to external content.
