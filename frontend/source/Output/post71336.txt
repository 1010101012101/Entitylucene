MBP 13" 2011 OSX Mountain Lion tries to connect to my imac at startup every time? <body> my MBP always tries to connect to my iMac server at startup, i have checked that this server is not listed under login items for my user account, guest accounts are disabled (never been used), and there are no other user accounts on the machine...does anyone know how i can prevent this from happening?  <comment83105> Do you routinely connect to this server for any reason? And, if so, how (e.g., through FTP, a client, etc.)?
