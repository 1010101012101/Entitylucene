iPad and iTunes videos <body> I bought an iPad for my 10 year old daughter.  I want to link that to my iTunes account so it will have all the Apps I bought for her on my iPad.  Through restrictions I can limit her access to any movies that are not G rated, but I also want to exclude my iTunes music videos (I actually wouldn't mind excluding all music).  Is there any way to keep my iTunes music videos off her iPad, but still download the apps that are age appropriate?
