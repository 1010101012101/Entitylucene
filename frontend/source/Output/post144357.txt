Rsync fails due to Sudo timeout <body> I am trying to run a lengthy Rsync (local machine only, no ssh, no lan or wan connects involved) but Sudo is timing out and the script fails. Total runtime of the command is about 20 mins. What is the recommend way to either lengthen the Sudo timeout or disable Sudo from that particular command only? I am the admin of this system but do not log in as root. Thank you in advance.  <answer144393> How are you actually invoking the script? If you run a script like codesudo script.sh/code, all commands inside the script are run as superuser and you should never have it time out. If you're running a script that has codesudo/code commands inside it, then it could ask for a password more than once if it takes too long between codesudo/code commands. The codesudo/code timeout only applies to new invocations of the codesudo/code command. If your case is the latter, you do have the option of using the command codesudo -v/code in your script which will extend the timeout by its default value (normally 5 minutes, but see below for how to change it), but if everything inside needs superuser permissions anyways, it makes more sense to invoke the entire script with codesudo/code.  If you do want to change the sudo time out, you need to edit the codesudoers/code file:  ol liBring up the codesudoers/code file:  precodesudo visudo /code/pre/li liFind the line that starts with:  precodeDefaults    env_reset /code/pre/li liAdd a comma and the command codetimestamp_timeout=minutes/code to the end (replace minutes with the number of minutes desired, 0 will always ask for a password, a negative number will never time out - emdangerous/em):  precodeDefaults    env_reset,timestamp_timeout=10 /code/pre/li liSave and close the file./li /ol  <comment170033> Which command are you actually running, what error message do you get when it fails? <comment170166> Perfect... Thank You.
