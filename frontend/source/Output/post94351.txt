How to uninstall TrueCrypt? <body> How to uninstall TrueCrypt 7.1a from my Mac cleanly? The instruction on TrueCrypt website is Windows-only.  <answer94426> Are you seeing a installation folder or an .exe file. Either way, the installation would not have gone anywhere, and I think it should safe to delete either. After you complete the delete, you can run a search for "TrueCrypt" to see if anything is left, but I doubt it would be.  However, I ran a check on TrueCrypt (truecrypt.org) and there is an OSX installer. If you have that, there may be more to be done. But you said you got a Windows installer, so I'll leave it at that.  <answer103394> The codeTrueCrypt/code installer is an codempkg/code file that contains multiple codepkg/code files within it. You can right click the installer in codeFinder/code, open package contents and see the codepkg/code files. Essentially, it installs MacFUSE and the TrueCrypt application. If you examine the codeTrueCrypt/code codempkg/code file with a tool like Pacifist, you'd see the list of files it installs and the locations.  codeTrueCrypt/code does not come with an uninstaller on OS X. But there are at least two ways to emattempt/em to uninstall it completely:  ul liAccording to help on the codeTrueCrypt/code forum, uninstalling it is a matter of removing MacFuse and the TrueCrypt app (you need to have an account on that forum to see this post):     sudo /Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/uninstall-macfuse-core.shbr   sudo rm -rf /Applications/TrueCrypt.app   OR/li liTry UninstallPKG to uninstall any application installed with a package (requires OS X 10.8 or later). I haven't used this, and do not know if it will be able to remove MacFUSE and TrueCrypt./li /ul  Once you've done this, check the list of files/locations reported by Pacifist, see if any of those are still around and remove them.  <comment131238> +1 for UninstallPKG, such a great tool I've just met! :)
