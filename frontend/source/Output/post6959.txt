Does the upgrading from Parallels Desktop (for Mac) 5 to 6 means reinstall Windows? <body> I have Parallels Desktop 5 for Mac. Does the upgrade to Parallels Desktop 6 means that I have to reinstall Windows 7 and all the other programs?    <answer6960> No, your Windows VM and all the programs installed on it are stored on a virtual hard drive file. Upgrading Parallels won't affect the VM.  <answer7005> To extend @Kyle's answer, which is correct by the way, you have to consider the fact that after the upgrade, you emmight have/em to re-authorize Windows. I really don't know what Windows is thinking or what Parallels is doing, but I've seen two people who had to re-authorize their Windows 7 Home Premium inside a VM after that upgrade from Parallels 5 to 6.   This was not a problem and is generally performed "automatically", but just have your product key handy just in case.   I haven't personally upgraded to 6 yet (and probably won't). Paying 40 dollars a year to Parallels is more expensive than having Windows dedicated machinesâ€¦  <answer7024> I had not trouble upgrading from 5 to 6 with Win 7 Enterprise.  <comment7443> But it does have to upgrade the vm, which can take a little while. Once you've upgraded you can't open it on the previous version of parallels anymore. <comment7444> Their upgrade cycle is crazy! It feels like they come out with a new version every tuesday!
