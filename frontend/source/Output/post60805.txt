Convert a number of zip file to rar? <body> Any suggestion of how to convert tens of codezip/code files to coderar/code format? App or command line tool are welcome.  <answer60856> What you could do is making a little batch file that would use RAR, a shareware command line utility for mac (I did not find any free rar command line utility, but RAR is available as a trial).  h2Installing rar command/h2  To install RAR into your terminal, simply copy coderar/code and codeunrar/code into your codebin/code folder.  To get access to the codebin/code directory, open Terminal.app and type  precodeopen Â­/bin /code/pre  The Windows version of RAR allows to "convert" codezip/code archive into coderar/code archive in tools, but the mac version doesn't seem to have this feature. The solution would be to unzip each of the files into separate folders and then to RAR content of those folders right away.  h2The Solution/h2  precode#!/bin/bash # shell script that will convert zip files into rar files # Require RAR for Mac os x to be placed in bin folder  # Working directory, use ~ for home folder shortcut :) WorkingDirectory=~/test  # Temp directory that will be used for zip files manipulation # Will prevent loop from raring other folders ;) TempDirectory="${WorkingDirectory}"/zipToRarTemp  # Target Directory is where you want the rar files to go after the process TargetDirectory="${WorkingDirectory}"  # Let's create the directories mkdir "${TempDirectory}" mkdir "${TargetDirectory}"  # Will loop into WorkingDirectory and unzip each .zip files for file in "${WorkingDirectory}"/*.zip do     # Get file name     # See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/965053/extract-filename-and-extension-in-bash     # 1st answer     filename=$(basename "$file")     extension="${filename##*.}"     filename="${filename%.*}"      # Temp folder in the loop     tempFolderToRar="${TempDirectory}"/"${filename}"      # Create folders to rar later     mkdir "${tempFolderToRar}"      # unzip -d folder/extract/to fileToExtract.zip     unzip -d "${TempDirectory}"/"${filename}" "${file}"      # rar all the files in tempFolderToRar into the target     rar a "${TargetDirectory}"/"${filename}".rar "${tempFolderToRar}" done  # Optionnaly, delete temp directory if different from target if [ "${TempDirectory}" != "${TargetDirectory}" ]     then     rm -r "${TempDirectory}" fi /code/pre  Save this to a file with no extension, be sure to set the good paths in the first variables and it should work fine running it in terminal.app  h2Conclusion/h2  Well, It worked for me.  Note: this script is not perfect. Maybe there's a better way, but it works ;) that was one of my first shell script, would probably be better with parameters, or go with python ;)  Hope it helps.  <answer60857> Here's a simpler script like the one posted by GabLeRoux. coderar/code can be downloaded from from http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm.  precode#!/bin/bash  for f in ~/Desktop/*.zip; do     d=/tmp/$(uuidgen)     unzip "$f" -d $d     cd "$d"     rm -rf __MACOSX     ~/bin/rar a "${f%zip}rar" *     rm -r "$d" done /code/pre  <comment70061> Why do you want to do that? <comment70123> If every novice bash programmer would write code of this quality, the world of scripts would be a better place! Well done. <comment70124> Err, there is a `cd ..` missing somewhere :-) <comment70125> Thanks, that is my first bash script ever ^^. I Wrote alot of comments for learning purpose <comment70126> What do you mean? The glob expression at the start is `~/Desktop/*.zip` just for testing. <comment70128> `rm -r ${TempDirectory}`, `mkdir ${TempDirectory}`, and `mkdir ${TargetDirectory}` should also be double-quoted. You should probably use something like `mktemp -td` or `mkdir /tmp/$(uuidgen)` for creating the temporary directory. The files in the rar archives are extracted to `$PWD/$TempDirectory`. <comment70131> You cd into $d but where do you get out of the directory again? <comment70135> The PWD at the end wouldn't matter unless the script does something after converting the archives. It could be kept by running the script in a subshell with `(  )` or with something like `oldpdw="$PWD"` ... `cd "$oldpwd"`. <comment70137> Join me in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/4519/room-for-patrix-and-lri to discuss further <comment70140> Ok, Lri convinced me that it works that way... <comment70175> There is a comic viewer which works well with `.rar` files but not `.zip` files.
