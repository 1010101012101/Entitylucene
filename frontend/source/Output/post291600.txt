Startup key combinations for Mac in cli <body> I've been using startup key stated by apple here for a while, and they are pretty good.  I can't find anywhere a way to force these in cli before a reboot ?  So far I managed to use bless to netboot without the need of physical access to the machine, and press the startup-key codeOption/code.  strongDoes it exist a way to reboot a remote machine, and force a startup-key without physical access ?/strong  <comment368133> Some: [Is there a list of available boot-args for darwin / OS X](https://superuser.com/questions/255176/is-there-a-list-of-available-boot-args-for-darwin-os-x) <comment368137> Ah cool. Not 100% what I'm looking for, but that's actually a really thing ! Gonna spend time reading that thread. <comment368147> Assuming you're in a Terminal session on the remote machine, wouldn't the `shutdown` and or `restart` _commands_, with the appropriate _options_, do what you want? Maybe in conjunction with info in the link klanomath posted? <comment368155> The problem is that, let's say I want to boot the machine in Startup Manager, the only option I have is to press the option key on the keyboard. There is (as far as I know) no where to add this as a command with a reboot option ?
