Aperture (iPhoto) quick view <body> I’ve put all my photographs into Aperture’s photo library which means that in the Finder they are hidden in a special folder, making it virtually impossible to quickly browse the photos there. On the other hand, starting up Aperture quickly demands more than 1 GB of RAM, which is something I’d really like to avoid.  In ‘Open File’ dialogues there is a ‘Media’ option which more or less does what I’m looking for. Is there a way to add this to the Finder (Snow Leopard) or is there some external program, I could use as a quick viewer?  (As the situation is similar to iPhoto, I’d expect solutions for the iPhoto library to work as well.)  <answer22396> Some options:  ol liMake a Media Browser with Automator - takes about 30 seconds - and you can invoke it in many ways - including with a contextual menu its,/li liInstall an app like http://www.karelia.com/imedia/ which will do the same with some extra bells and whistles./li /ol  That said, if you use an app like Aperture or iPhoto to manage your photos then they are the "go-to" apps for anything to do with your photos - including viewing them. What you have there is an argument for getting more Ram ;)  If you really want to you could run either app in Referenced Mode. This would leave your Masters (and note: Masters only) accessible via the Finder. While I am happy recommending Aperture in Referenced Mode, I would have significant reservations about running iPhoto in that way.  <comment24842> My MacBook doesn’t allow me to use more than 4 GB. No doubt, I’d install more if it was possible. :) <comment24844> Hmm. ‘Ask for photos’ in Automator only shows iPhoto and Photo Booth; iMedia does not give me an album overview when the top level is selected which would make it much more useful.
