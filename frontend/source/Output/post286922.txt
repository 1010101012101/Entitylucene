I am looking for a way to push mac software from AD server to connected MAC clients <body> We have an AD server to which windows and Mac clients are registered. We are able to push msi package to all connected Windows clients through a GPO policy. We are trying to push Mac package to Mac clients. Can anyone suggest any idea or documents to create GPO for mac clients. Any information is very much appreciable. Thanks  <comment362149> I do not believe that an Active Directory domain can push Mac applications. I believe you are pretty much limited to authentication anything more than that will require macOS server or some add-on software to your domain controllers that can do more than simple domain authentication. I am not providing this as an "answer" as I have not done or tried to do this myself but believe it to be correct. <comment362150> @SteveChambers thank you, If you could help me that saves my time. Is there any documents stating that AD can't be used to push mac applications. So that i will look for other solutions like N-Able. Thanks
