Should I reformat a disk if Disk Utility asks me to? <body> I have a FAT32 external disc that was suddenly unmounted as I was using it. When I reconnected it and tried to Repair it in Disk Utility, I got the following messages:  precodeVerify and Repair volume “COMMON” Checking file system** /dev/disk3s1 Can't open (Resource busy) Volume repair complete. Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required. Error: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files. /code/pre  I then tried to do only a Verify, which succeeded:  precodeVerifying volume “COMMON” Checking file system** /dev/disk3s1 ** Phase 1 - Preparing FAT ** Phase 2 - Checking Directories ** Phase 3 - Checking for Orphan Clusters 29576 files, 36220416 KiB free (1131888 clusters) /code/pre  I then re-tried the Repair, which succeeded:  precodeVerify and Repair volume “COMMON” Checking file system** /dev/disk3s1 ** Phase 1 - Preparing FAT ** Phase 2 - Checking Directories ** Phase 3 - Checking for Orphan Clusters 29597 files, 36219680 KiB free (1131865 clusters) Volume repair complete. Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required. /code/pre  Does the fact that the Verify and the latter Repair succeeded mean that the filesystem is in a 100% good state? Or is the verification not exhaustive, which means that it's safer to reformat the disk?  <answer143086> Since the error that showed up the first time was just codeCan't open (Resource busy)/code, I wouldn't worry about it. It didn't actually do anything the first time. I'm guessing you had a file open or something and it couldn't unmount the volume to repair. I think the reformat message shows up if a repair fails, for any reason, even if it has nothing to do with the filesystem.
