MacBook Pro (Late 2011) sound issues in Windows 10 (no Bootcamp) <body> I recently installed Windows 10 on my MacBook Pro (Late 2011). I installed the drivers I could find from the internet (I installed this package https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1721?locale=en_GB) and everything is working fine (kind of very bad performance) but the sound. I can't get it to work, the speaker in the menubar (in windows) shows a red cross and when I hover the mouse over it it says: No Audio output device installed. In Device Manager, the internal speaker appears but it displays an initialization error (code 10). I wiped macOS during installation so I have no access to it (or to recovery mode). Please Help.  <answer278543> Read the webpage you downloaded the support software from more carefully.     Note: If you are using one of the Macs listed below, you should download Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621 instead:      ul   liMacBook Pro (13-inch,15-inch &amp; 17-inch  Late 2011) /li   /ul   Try downloading and installing Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621 and that should fix your problem.  <answer278633> I would check out this link here.

Sorry. :(  <comment350498> Are you using Bootcamp? Did you attempt to make a driver disc from the bootcamp installer and use that to install the appropriate Windows drivers for your hardware? <comment350501> Nope, I wiped my entire hard drive. Originally I was going to install macOS again and then use bootcamp to install Windows but since I don't use macOS anyways, I chose to install Windows only. <comment350694> Tried it, sound still not working
