Bash script to run command with prompt for input <body> How can I create a script using the following command?  codemmap -sn -n x.x.x.x/8/code, code/16/code, code/24/code and so on. I would like the script to run the command when I type in "sweep" and then prompt me for the subnet that I would like it to look on.  <answer127251> In your script you can put :  precodeecho "Input subnet" read subnet  /code/pre  to get user input and store it in a variable called subnet.  Though there is obviously no checking to see if you entered a valid subnet.  <comment149116> Welcome to Ask Different! What have you tried so far?
