In Finder's List view, is there a keyboard shortcut to go to top/bottom of list? <body> Before Leopard, hitting the Spacebar would take you to the bottom file in List view -- but that now initiates QuickLook. As far as I know there has never been a keyboard shortcut to go to the top of the list. Or am I just ignorant?  <answer12786> Yep!  You can use kbdopt/kbd-kbd&uarr;/kbd to jump to the top of the list and kbdopt/kbd-kbd&darr;/kbd to jump to the bottom.  <answer257771> Control-Option-Up and Control-Option-Down appear to work in El Capitan.  <comment13483> O frabjous day!!  Glory be!!  This has absolutely made my day, Dave! Many thanks indeed! -- Drew <comment124524> it's like being lifted out of the dark ages <comment308031> This doesn't appear to be working on El Capitan. <comment322043> I donâ€™t know about El Cap, but it still works under Sierra. <comment322046> Hi Ron, Welcome to Ask Different, please add a few details to your answer to maintain high quality of the form. <comment361297> Looks fine to me, what's the problem? <comment361298> Can I just poll the community here on whether this is intuitive? Personally, I've always found it profoundly confusing that Command+direction is "scroll to end" in every other context (text editor, browser, etc.), but that those have specific actions in Finder.
