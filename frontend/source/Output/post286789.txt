4G signal on phone, but showing LTE on my MacBook <body> Usually, the signal strength on the iPhone is the same with the one shown on my MacBook:     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIiCm.png" alt=""   However, in a specific area, between two hills, where the signal is pretty poor, my iPhone shows 1 circle of 4G signal (and the internet does work pretty well on the iPhone), but my MacBook shows 1 circle of LTE signal, and it's very slow.  Is there any setting that I can change to make the MacBook internet via Hotspot faster?  Why is this happening?  <answer287604> Reading about 4G vs LTE, I found LTE includes 4G. So, technically it's correct.  And sometimes, even it shows 4G on my MacBook, it's still slow. It seems to be just the naming.
