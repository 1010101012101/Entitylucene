Macfusion - how can I auto connect on boot? <body> I have Macfusion automatically running when I boot, but how can I have it automatically connect to a server?  Can't find this anywhere..  <answer8068> Depending on your version of MacOS, you may be able to use Lingon to create a startup script that runs after you login to your mac.  You will likely need to figure out a command line equivalent to whatever you currently do in the finder to connect to a server.  Run that command in the terminal to verify it works, then create a script using Lingon to execute the command immediately after you login to your Mac.  The project used to be hosted on SourceForge, but "as of 2009-07-06, [â€¦] is no longer under active development". See new link above.  <answer11196> Turns out MacFusion is garbage just in case anyone wondered so I abandoned this idea and went back to Cyberduck  <comment11733> [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/)'s disc mode is a far better implementation than MacFusion. It has some [bugs](https://twitter.com/nuc/status/47945970817830912) though :( <comment11742> It would be better if you entered this answer as a comment in your own question though.. <comment88852> What are the specific aspects that make of macfusion such an non-usable piece of software? Just curious.
