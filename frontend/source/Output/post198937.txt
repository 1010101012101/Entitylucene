How do I whitelist a domain in iOS restrictions web filter? <body> Turning on iOS restrictions (Settings - General - Restrictions) and the web filter inside (probably "Websites - Restrict adult content" or something similar in English), I tried whitelisting codewikipedia.org/code but the whitelist doesn't seem to work. For instance, the page "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control" is still blocked.  I tried whitelisting code*.wikipedia.org/*/code. It still doesn't work, and I can't find any instructions on how to format the entries.  emHow do I exclude a specific domain from being filtered?/em  With respect, strongplease refrain from/strong non-answers such as "just turn off restrictions" or suggesting unrealistic solutions like "you have to enter every possible subdomain by hand without using wildcards".  emIphone 5 running Ios 8.4/em  <comment238224> Please provide more detail on where in settings you are enabling and attempting to whitelist.  I tried to follow along and see if I could figure it out, but I can't find the settings section you are working with. <comment238225> @Tyson I added the path to restrictions.
