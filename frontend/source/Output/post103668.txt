Disable Spotlight Index on 10.8 on Specific Volumes <body> To switch off indexing in Terminal I use:  precodesudo mdutil -a -i off /code/pre  This disables it with the code-a/code switch across all volumes and the code-i off/code part turns "off" the indexing.  If connected to my iMac is the following volumes:  precode/Volumes   /MacintoshHD   /BOOTCAMP   /NAS6TB /code/pre  How do I specifically turn off the indexing service only for code/BOOTCAMP/code and code/NAS6TB/code? I tried following the instructions in the man page, but they weren't very clear.  <answer103670> From terminal type:  precodesudo mdutil -i off [mountpoint] /code/pre  If you need to remove the index cache of a network drive that has been stored locally, then use the code-p/code flag. Likewise, to remove the local cache of a locally attached volume, use the code-E/code flag.  If you want to delete from code/BOOTCAMP/code then you would use:  precodesudo mdutil -Ei off "/Volumes/BOOTCAMP" /code/pre  strongNOTE:/strong Quotations around the mountpoint of the volume are unnecessary if there are no spaces in the volume name or mountpoint. Otherwise you would need to use an escape character code\/code before each space.  stronge.g./strong codesudo mdtuil -Ei off /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/code for "Macintosh HD"  <answer103690> Open spotlight preferences in strongSystem Preferences/strong and drag each folder to be excluded into the exclusion list.  <answer103790> Spotlight is a powerful tool for searching results in few seconds. Still if you want to disable, it can be done  using launchctl, with password:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  Or, to switch off the indexing, you can follow this command  precodesudo mdutil -a -i off /code/pre  <comment173391> the OP is aware of `sudo mdutil -a -i off` and asked how to disable indexing of a specific Volume.
