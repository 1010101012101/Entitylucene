Automator Localization issue? <body> I have some difficulties understanding what's wrong in Automator:  I used to launch a short automator script with an codeexiftool/code command to organize my pictures by folders:  precodeexiftool -v '-Directory &lt; DateTimeOriginal' -d /Users/home/Pictures/Photos-Sources/APN/%Y/%Y-%m" "%B/%Y-%m-%d" "%A -r "$f" /code/pre  This script created a folder named according to the date the photo was taken. In my case, some arguments (month or day) are in "French literary", due to my OS X configuration (codeexiftool/code doesn't come with any localization option).  After Mavericks installation, the script is still working, but these same arguments are in English only; even when I use this script in a Terminal, they still come in French.  Does anyone have the same issue, or anyone else could help me to understand if I'm mistaken somewhere?  <answer110974> You can change the time format by setting LC_TIME to fr_FR:  codeLC_TIME=fr_FR exiftool -v '-Directory&lt;DateTimeOriginal' -d ~/Pictures/Photos-Sources/APN/%Y/%Y-%m\ %B/%Y-%m-%d\ %A -r "$f"/code  precode$ LC_TIME=C date +%A\ %B Monday November $ LC_TIME=fr_FR date +%A\ %B Lundi novembre /code/pre  Terminal and iTerm 2 set LANG (which changes LC_TIME) automatically based on the region selected in System Preferences.  On my installations of 10.8 and 10.9, the Run Shell Script command uses the C locale by default though.
