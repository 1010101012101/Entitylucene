View music size by artist on iOS <body> I'm trying to free up space on an iPhone. Most of the space is used by music.  Is there a way to see which artists are using the most amount of space?  Logically this would be displayed under "System Settings app  General  Usage  Music", but unlike the "Usage  podcast" there is no break down beyond "All Music : x GB"  Can this be done easily in either iOS or iTunes, emon a per-device/em basis (I only have a subset of music sync'd to the iPhone, so cannot just look at folder sizes in the "iTunes Music" directory)  <answer79609> You can view all the music on your iPhone in iTunes, and can then sort by size of the each individual song. I don't think there's a way to sort by the size of the artist.  Note, you can only delete items from this list is you are using "manually manage music".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wobYA.png" alt="enter image description here"
