What does the arrow with 2 lines through it mean? <body> In Xcode, a lot of the shortcuts use an arrow with 2 lines though it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOnTv.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is the keystroke corresponding to this?  <answer79999> That is the page or scroll up key. On a MacBook the keystroke is Fn-Up Arrow.  “What Do the ⌘, ⇧, ⌥, ⌃, ⎋, ↩, ⇥, ↖ and ↘ Menu Symbols Mean?”  Each symbol corresponds to a key on your keyboard:  ⌘ — Command/Apple key  ⇧ — Shift key  ⌥ — Option/Alt key  ⌃ — Control key  ↩ — Return key  ⇥ — Tab key  ⎋ — Escape key  ↖ — Home key (Function-Left Arrow on laptops)  ↘ — End key (Function-Right Arrow on laptops)  There is a very handy reference at harvard.edu.  <comment92281> Just beat me to it. Daniel Aleksandersen also provides [Unicode symbols for the Mac keyboard special keys](http://my.opera.com/daniel/blog/2012/02/27/unicode-symbols-for-the-mac-keyboard-special-keys) <comment92282> Ok, here's one I haven't been able to figure out.. `ClrLn`? <comment92284> Clear Line. With Emacs key bindings, Ctrl-k.
