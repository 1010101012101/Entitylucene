PDF screen capture cannot be open <body> When I use "screencapture" Apple shell function, the created PDF screenshot cannot be open by any of the PDF readers. What would be the problem with those screenshots?  <comment285743> What PDF readers are you trying to use to open the created files? <comment285868> I would think screencapture makes files in PNG, no? Have you tried just double-clicking the image created or opening it in its default app? <comment285960> First, I changed the format of saved screenshots to be PDF. I tried Mac Preview and Acrobat.
