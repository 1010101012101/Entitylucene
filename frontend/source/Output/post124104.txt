OSE switch to application from mobile device <body> Is there a strongmobile app/strong that lets you view the list applications you're currently running on a computer you're using?  For instance, my mobile device would connect as a strongclient/strong to my MacBook Pro, and have live info about what's running and which app I'm currently using:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BRQHZ.png" alt="MobileAltTab"  Showing the currently selected app similar to OSX's strongalt tab/strong functionality, and when I touch a particular app, it becomes strongselected/strong and in the foreground.
