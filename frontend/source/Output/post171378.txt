launchd notification on abnormal exit <body> I have a launchd job plist that runs a simple shell script that invokes rdiff-backup to backup a remote directory over SSH to my computer. The job runs every hour and it works well.  Except the other day there was a power failure* and the rdiff-backup job was interrupted. The next time launchd ran the script, rdiff-backup failed and logged it's failure to the path specified in the plist. launchd, noticing the abnormal exit code, stopped trying to run the script.  And I had no idea for six days.   Obviously I don't want a notification of the exit code strongevery/strong time the script finishes. What can I do to be notified only of abnormal exits?  (*) turns out my UPS battery was passing the self-test when invoked, but didn't actually have the ability to power even a minimal load for more than 3 seconds.  <answer231681> The traditional approach, e.g. with codecron/code jobs, is to pipe standard error to a program like codemail/code that's smart enough not to send you empty mail. The difference with launchd, as you've discovered, is that the mechanism for redirecting standard error is giving a codeStandardErrorPath/code for it to be written to, which isn't as convenient for this purpose as ending your crontab entry with code| mail â€¦/code.  My usual solution is to have a wrapper script check the codeStandardErrorPath/code and notify me if there's a problem. This can either be part of the same launchd job, so the checking happens before the next scheduled run, or you can have a separate job that just manages the error logs (maybe using a codeQueueDirectories/code key).  I think you could also, for example, use a named pipe as your job's codeStandardErrorPath/code, but I've never actually tried that.
