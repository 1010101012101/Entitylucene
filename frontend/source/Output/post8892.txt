Does the developer of a Mac OS X app get the crash reports when the app crashes? <body> If an app crashes while I'm using it in OS X I get a little (apparently) OS-driven dialog that lets me "report the crash to Apple". It sends along a stack trace and some other system information.   Does this crash information get shared with the app developer of the app in question at the time the crash occurred?  <answer8894> Mac OS X Reference Library Technical Note TN2123 states:     CrashReporter performs two useful   actions:      ul   liWhen a program crashes, CrashReporter will record a crash log   (typically into   ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/), and   inform the user by logging a message   to the system logging facility./li   liIn addition, if the program that crashed is running as a logged in GUI   user, CrashReporter will present the   user with a dialog asking them whether   they want to submit a bug report to   Apple (see Figure 1). If the user   clicks the Report button,   CrashReporter displays another dialog   that shows the details of the report   (see Figure 2) and allows them to   comment it before submission./li   /ul   And not much further along, states:     In this technote I explain how to interpret crash logs that you have obtained from end users.   I believe this implies that the information is not automatically shared with the developer.  The developer needs to "obtain" the crash logs from the end users' ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/ folder.  <answer8896> I think Apple is currently preparing a system for developers of apps in the Mac App Store. The iTunes Connect interface already shows a "Crash Logs" button, so I guess it will be possible this year.  <answer8900> Recently announced by Apple (Dec. 17, 2010), the iTunes Developer Guide [PDF] illustrates how a Mac App Store developer may receive crash log reports for their apps. This isn't true for apps downloaded outside of the Mac App Store, unless the developer has coded that functionality in manually.  <answer288773> The crash reports seem available in the Crashes organizer. See the guide Analyzing Crash Reports for details.  <comment9895> This answer is confusing. According to another answer, no, developers don't get the report, only apple does; unless they are using the app store. <comment148865> In the [CrashReporter Limitations](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2004/tn2123.html#SECLIMITATIONS) section of that Tech Note, it says "There is currently no way for third party developers to access the reports submitted via CrashReporter." The last noted revision of that doc was in 2008. I don't know how good Apple is about either removing or marking as such docs that they're no longer maintaining. <comment148869> [Here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/ImprovingCustomersExperience.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH27-SW1)'s an up-to-date link to the relevant part of the guide. <comment148870> Heh, yes, that Tech Note *is* in fact out of date, yet not marked as such. A way for 3rd-party devs to access CrashReporter reports under at least some circumstances is described [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/ImprovingCustomersExperience.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH27-SW1). <comment364709> @TerryN Now that section does not provide any information about crash report. Perhaps relevant information was removed.
