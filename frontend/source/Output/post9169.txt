Delete all events in iCal <body> How can I delete all events in iCal? I have a bunch of events (some reoccurring) that I want to delete. I don't want to have to manually delete/cut each event.  I tried declining the events but that just turns them gray.  I'm running OS X 10.6.6.  <answer9174> Applescript:  precodetell application "iCal"    tell calendar "My Calendar" -- your calendar here       set theEvents to every event       repeat with current_event in theEvents                     delete current_event       end repeat    end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer9294> I solved it by deleting code~/Library/Calendars/code as suggested in here.
