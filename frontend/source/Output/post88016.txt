How can I make iOS 4.3 apps go onto my iPod 2G? <body> Last Christmas I was given an iPod 2G and it runs on iOS 4.2.1 and I have found it very hard to find apps that go onto my iPod, is there anyway I can make apps that run on iOS 4.3 an above go onto my iPod?  <answer88018> No. Unfortunately, due to hardware limitations, Apple has limited how far you can upgrade iOS on particular devices.  See this question for a similar situation. Perhaps this Q/A would explain things better as well.  <answer90021> You can get whited00r 6 that just came out. Whited00r 6 has many features from ios 6 including costom backgrounds, multitasking, and siri on iphone 2g and 3g, and on ipod touch 1g and 2g
