"XXX can't be opened. You should move it to trash." for flash projector applications on mac os sierra <body> We are experiencing a problem with flash projector .app executables that we build. When the app is downloaded from the internet on OSX sierra the message "strongXXX can't be opened. You should move it to trash./strong" is thrown.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Izdn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Clicking on the help icon next to it additionally displays the info:     The app’s authorization has been revoked There may be a problem with   this app. Although the app was signed by an identified developer, the   certificate for the app has been revoked, and it cannot be opened.   The same app copied through a pen drive works fine. The same app downloaded over internet in other OSX versions runs fine.  We have tried options like SettingsSecurity  allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere in the OSX Gatekeeper settings. The application being a app published by Flash CS6 is not something that we sign ourselves. I have also read elsewhere that the Flash Player certificate was revoked by apple earlier due to a breach. But updating the Flash software with latest patches has not made a difference.  Has anyone else experienced this issue. Any workarounds/advise? Thanks!  <answer262361> This is usually a permissions issue. If so, here's how to fix it:  ol liOpen Terminal and type the following command, but don't press enter: codesudo chmod +x /code/li liBe sure to type a space after the codex/code./li liThen, navigate to the application in the Finder./li liRight-click it and choose "Show package contents."/li liNavigate to Contents/MacOS/li liUsually there's just one file; if so, select it. Otherwise, find the one that's most like the application's name, with no extension./li liClick the file and drag it to the Terminal window./li liHit kbdEnter/kbd/kbdReturn/kbd and authenticate with an admin password./li /ol  <comment328860> Thanks for the permissions fix info. Indeed the file does run after running chmod so it is a permissions issue. My problem however is that the .app has to be provided to users for download over the internet. We can't expect our users to follow these steps to be able to run the app. Any advise on how the file can be runnable on download. <comment328883> If you simply zip it, that should do the problem. Right click the app and select "Compress" or "Create Archive" (depending on macOS version), and upload the resulting zip file.
