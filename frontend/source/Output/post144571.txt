How to get 'favorites' to display in finder...? <body> I used to have several favorites in the sidebar of the finder window, but today they are gone.    I cannot drag folders into the sidebar, and I can't display the ones available to choose from in Finder  Preferences.  WTF?  Here's a little screen capture of it misbehaving:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ptsqB.gif" alt=""  <answer207400> The first thing to try is to make a new user account and then see if the finder sidebar functions there.  If so, you can log out and delete that user account and then make a backup of the system. You'll want to delete the user preferences for Finder.  precodedefaults delete com.apple.Finder /code/pre  Then log out and back it to see if the finder sidebar is working.
