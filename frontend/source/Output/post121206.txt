when is the /etc/hosts file loaded? <body> I'm trying to configure some virtual hosts and I'm quite confused as to when this file is loaded.  At what point is code/private/etc/hosts/code loaded? When logging in? At every DNS call? When Mac OS restarts?  <answer121207> The hosts(5) manual page provides some insight into how code/etc/hosts/code is used.   The file is used by codemDNSResponder/code and, given your question, I suspect you want to see edits to code/etc/hosts/code reflected in your DNS look-ups.  After each edit of code/etc/hosts/code reset the codemDNSResponder/code cache using this Apple technical note, OS X: How to reset the DNS cache:  precodesudo dscacheutil -flushcache /code/pre  The note explains when you might need to do this:     strongWhen you might want to do this/strong      OS X keeps a local cache of resolved DNS queries for a time defined by   the DNS server, but sometimes it may be necessary to reset the cache   immediately and re-query a DNS server. For example, you might do this   after an entry on the server is changed or a new entry is added.   <answer121258> Usually changes to code/etc/hosts/code are updated automatically within a few seconds, and I haven't needed to reset the DNS cache manually.  If you try to run codesudo opensnoop|grep /etc/hosts/code and edit code/etc/hosts/code, code/etc/hosts/code is read by codemDNSResponder/code almost immediately after you save it.  <comment141327> I suspect in later versions of OS X, Apple started actively watching the `hosts` file for changes using the kqueue mechanism.
