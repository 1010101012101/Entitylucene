How to customize the Do Not Disturb feature for weekends? <body> I have the Do Not Disturb feature scheduled to work from Midnight to 7 am.  This works great.    However, on the weekend I like to sleep in and would like the Do Not Disturb feature to go until 9 am.  But I do not see this feature.  It's like all or nothing.  Am I missing something simple?  <answer129738> strongThis currently can't be done./strong Schedules you select apply to all the days of the week.
