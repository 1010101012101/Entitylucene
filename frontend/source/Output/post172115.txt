Can you buy Apple Care from eBay after purchase iPhone? <body> I see advertisements on eBay selling Apple Care for half the price. I bought my iPhone 6 a week ago.  Can I still buy discounted Apple Care from eBay?  <answer172124> strongCaveat Emptor/strong  You might be buying a sealed, boxed product at a reasonable price…br …only to discover it's only valid in Outer Mongolia.  Different countries have different statutory requirements &amp; Applecare varies country to country.  I'd be more circumspect.  Read this before even considering it - https://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone.htmlbr strongembut/em/strong make sure to swap to your own country via the flag icon in the very bottom right corner of the page before reading it.  <comment202601> It's great if you are from Outer Mongolia though.
