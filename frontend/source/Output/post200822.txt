They are located in many folders, say  precode\aaa\hello.jpg \bbb\hello.jpg \adaage\hello.jpg /code/pre  I want to change their name to   precode\aaa\aaa_hello.jpg \bbb\bbb_hello.jpg ... /code/pre  How can I accomplish this?  <answer200823> This is what I find when googling around for batch renaming files, hope it helps you. http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-easy-ways-to-batch-rename-files-on-the-mac--mac-46999  <answer200839> You can run this command in strongTerminal/strong:  precodefind . -name hello.jpg -exec bash -c 'mv "$1" "${1%/*}"/"$(echo $(dirname "$1")_$(basename "$1"))"' -- {} \; /code/pre  This will find all codehello.jpg/code files inside directories and prepend dir name in front of the filename.
