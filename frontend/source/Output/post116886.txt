How can I do asynchronous download of sites of using Transmit's Automator action? <body> I want to take backup of my sites regularly, so I setup Automator with Transmit. I also used Calendar to trigger the downloads on schedule.  The problem is how can I tell Automator to download sites one at a time, rather than opening number of transmit copies.  At the moment I use "Pause", but would be more accurate to know if one download is completed then launch the next download.  <comment136668> How are you telling Automator to download the sites? <comment136669> Automator  application  type download then it will show you the "Transmit" icon. from there you can pickup the site you want to download and set the remote and local path.
