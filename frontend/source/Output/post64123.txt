Text comparison application <body> I'm looking for a simple text comparison tool. Something which just compares two quick text, I don't care about file comparison, just quick text side by side comparison.  <answer64127> In strongTextWrangler/strong, there is a command "Compare Two Front Documents". TextWrangler is not just a simple text comparison tool, but it's free, and if you need to edit text anyway, it's a useful feature.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dibVN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment75229> Thanks for reminding me. I actually use vim as my main text editor and I forget about vimddiff :)
