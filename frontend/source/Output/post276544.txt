Loading a template on mac <body> I'm creating a custom template for a Mac client to use in MS Word. I want to find the simplest way to send the .dot file to him, and tell him how to load it in the proper place. Once before I created an add-in for Excel for Mac, and once it was downloaded, the Mac automatically put it in the addins folder. Will it do the same in this case, or do I need to supply more instructions?
