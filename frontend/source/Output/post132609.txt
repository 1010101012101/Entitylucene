Looking for Mac Typing software that supports Spanish keyboard layouts - Recommendations? <body> I've moved from Windows to the Mac a while ago, and in this "self-improvement" path, I've also realized that I need to learn to touch-type (I can do around 50-60 WPM with 3-and-a-half fingers, but I need more).  I'm a Spanish speaker so I need to learn on a Spanish keyboard. I've already seen the answer to a similar question here (Looking for a typing tutor app) but all the answers offered assume English keyboards  I'm looking for a more "guided" learning approach.  <answer132632> Maybe this is what you are looking for:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SEuWa.png" alt="spanish"  <comment157059> If you just need to practice, isn't something like [Typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/?universe=lang_es) an option? <comment157068> Hi, @Mathias711. I'm looking for a more "guided" learning approach, but thanks a million for the link, I'll certainly save it to test my skills as I go along!
