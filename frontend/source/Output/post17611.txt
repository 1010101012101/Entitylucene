Getting multiple Apple IDs <body> Is it possible to have multiple Apple IDs?   Can I have different Apple Ids using my different email ids?   <answer17614> Yes, an Apple ID is per email address, so you can have multiple Apple IDs in the same store, or different store.  <answer17663> I agree with Anthony Green's reply as you can have multiple Apple Accounts. But as of this time I would recommend against it as you can't merge account purchases to one account. So if you're going to use the upcoming iCloud service you can only sync one account with it, so anything on the second account that you have purchased will not sync.   Hopefully Apple will allow you to sync account purchases from multiple accounts to one master account in the future but who knows, sigh...  <comment19339> If I get one Apple ID with my email id, can't i later change the email identification of the same ID? <comment19347> you can change the email the alerts get sent to but the email used with the Apple Id will be the same. So if you register with phill@apple.com as your Apple Id, you can always change your email notifications to phill@other.com but your Apple Id is still phill@apple.com. You can still open another Apple Id with phill@other.com but then all of your purchases with phill@apple.com wont transfer to the new Id so you will have two Apple Id's <comment31634> i think it's possible now to change at appleid.apple.com, there's an edit field for the Primary Email Address; i haven't tested this. <comment31638> you can change your email address not Apple id <comment85766> Whats the advantage to having more than one Apple ID ? Isnt it best to stick with one for life ?
