Can't open Firefox because a copy of Firefox is already open <body> I have multiple users on my MacBook (OS X 10.9.5). One of them has parential restrictions, but is allowed to use Firefox. Now, despite that, she is unable to run Firefox: whenever she tries, an error box pops up with the message     Close Firefoxbr   A copy of Firefox is already open. Only one copy of Firefox can be open at a time.   (needless to say that Firefox was not open, neither by her nor by any other user, and that none of the other users has that problem).  It appears this occured after a recent update of Firefox (to version 39.0).  What could be the cause of this? How can I sort this out?  <answer196774> I find a solution online here, you can check it. https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-already-running-not-responding  <answer196851> emma24xia's answer is for Windows and not applicable on a Mac. On a Mac you would do it this way.   Open up Applications/Utilities and launch Activity Monitor.  Look for Firefox in that list. Select it and click the stop-sign icon to force quit that process.  <answer238169> Here is what I did to fix the issue:  ul liIn OS X Terminal, find your currently used Firefox profile directory (something like): code $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/ $ ls -l /code/li liif you have multiple profiles, list the one with the most recent date code $ cd rAnd0m.default $ ls -la /code /li liremove the hidden parentlock file code $ rm -v .parentlock /code/li litry to start Firefox again/li /ul  (If the problem was not related to the parentlock file, you will see: coderm: .parentlock: No such file or directory/code)  If you prefer to use the Finder, just make hidden dot-files visible first, so you can check for the existence of .parentlock and delete it.  <answer258290> When I got this message I only had to kill the stray process, no lock was involved for me.  precode% ps -wwax | grep -i firefo 81106 ??       711:45.58 /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -foreground 28986 ttys000    0:00.00 grep -i firefo  % kill 81106 /code/pre  Despite the process still being "secretly" alive, there was no Firefox visibile in the codecmd-tab/code task switcher, nor under the codecmd-opt-esc/code Force Quit dialog.  Firefox was in this state after a crash/restart.  <answer263079> The only solution I could find so far was to open an unsaved file in some kind of editor and do a "Log Out ".   If you are lucky, the stuck process will disappear from the dock before editor complains about unsaved file so you can click "Cancel", and most of your workspace will stay there.  <comment235137> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment235974> Your link provided the correct solution: remove the .parentlock file. <comment235975> Sorry, but this was not the solution: there is no other running Firefox process running. The only one shown by the activity monitor is the one that displays the error box. <comment236319> Glad that helps you guys. <comment329619> I think making hidden (dot) files visible within Finder is not trivial ... <comment331611> This solved my problem, the answers above this one did not. Thank you! <comment349788> that worked for me <comment370427> I found that I also had a 'ghost process' running - @joshua's answer (using `ps -wwax | grep firefo`) was needed to find and kill it. btw, the process didn't appear in OSX's 'force quit' list. <comment370428> I had several running - the one that solved the problem was a plugin container (recognisable by the path).
