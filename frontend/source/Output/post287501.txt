Can't start first song/album/item in iTunes/Apple Music <body> I am often running into the problem of iTunes/Apple Music not playing the first song, album or item on a playlist, when I click on it.  See the following gif, and notice how the song doesn't change, no matter how many times I click on the specific item.  See this gif: http://i.imgur.com/uhIAfsg.gif (I can't seem to embed it)  My girlfriend is noticing the same problem in her iTunes. This has been around since the beginning of Apple Music, I feel. It also happens on different machines with different versions of Mac OS and iTunes.  I have NOT noticed it on iOS yet.
