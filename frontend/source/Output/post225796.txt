iOS apps that offer push notification interface (APN) via API <body> I'm looking for a standalone iOS app, that can display APN's on my iPhone screen, by sending a request to their API.  Some of these seem to have existed in the past: Notifo, Howl and Prowl.  None of these seem to be active however.  Perhaps they might have been pulled down because of violations on Apple's ToS ?  <comment277480> Is IFTTT not an option? It's not *exactly* what you want, but it might get the job done. <comment277537> I heard about IFTTT but haven't tested that one out yet.  Will do now.  Does it run as background process or does it display native APN? <comment277622> I don't use their iOS app, so I wouldn't be able to speak to it, but I use their service for other things and automation. All I know is that at one point they had iOS notifications (not sure if they still do). If they don't still have notifications, they have a lot of other automation tasks that might work out just as good or better (SMS, email, etc).
