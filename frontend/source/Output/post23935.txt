Can a Mac's airport card run 802.11 N, G, B or A only? <body> Occasionally it's nice to hard code a wired connection network port to not auto negotiate and force things to be 100 half duplex even though a higher speed is configured and negotiable on the switch.  Can I similarly force airport software and thus the hardware to only run one flavor of 802.11? Can I use the codeairport/code command to prefer a higher / lower channel rather than join by signal strength? Might alternative drivers be available or some developer testing tool to exert this level of control over the WiFi chipsets in Macs.  I want to force this on the mac end for cases where I can't control the base stations or want to test a specific channel of a simultaneous dual band router that is live with other traffic.  precodemac:bin mike$ airport --scan                             SSID BSSID             RSSI CHANNEL HT CC SECURITY (auth/unicast/group)                      na ala hele 00:26:36:9c:32:23 -59  2       Y  US WPA(PSK/TKIP/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP)                       na ala hele 00:26:bb:79:23:1f -59  2       Y  US WPA(PSK/TKIP/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP)                  fast na ala hele 00:26:bb:79:23:20 -74  149,+1  Y  US WPA(PSK/TKIP/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP)  mac:bin mike$ airport --getinfo      agrCtlRSSI: -75      agrExtRSSI: 0     agrCtlNoise: -86     agrExtNoise: 0           state: running         op mode: station       lastTxRate: 81         maxRate: 300 lastAssocStatus: 0     802.11 auth: open       link auth: wpa2-psk           BSSID: 00:26:bb:79:23:20            SSID: fast na ala hele             MCS: 4         channel: 149,1 mac:bin mike$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/airport  lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  89 Sep 13 11:40 /usr/local/bin/airport -&gt; /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /code/pre  <answer23948> From my understanding, I think this is only possible at the router level. So that router's will only accept "X" traffic, and not at the broadcast level (your NIC). I suppose you could use ipfw to throttle bandwidth on certain machines, to do, um, your testing ;)  <answer24639> Maybe this help, you can access to the airport command utility with  precodesudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport /code/pre  Then, type  precodesudo airport en1 prefs JoinMode=Strongest JoinModeFallback=KeepLooking /code/pre  JoinMode = Ranked and JoinModeFallback = Prompt are the defaults, if you want to switch back  <answer24932> If you just want to check whether the base station is sending on the right channel, Kismac may be of use to you. This will show all modes that your Airport card supports, including dual-band base stations. It's also great for checking wi-fi coverage with the built-in signal monitor, which can chart signal strength as you walk around with laptop in hand.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r6TjR.png" alt="Overview"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5E2z.png" alt="Signal chart"  <answer95756> With the Wireless Diagnostic that Apple introduced in 10.8.4 - I now have the beginnings of a workable answer.  Running the tool (which is in /System/Library/Core Services) by option clicking the Airport icon in the menu bar - I can capture arbitrary frames on any allowable channel (but not actually join a base station on this specified channel or radio mode). This saves a standard codetcpdump/code file that can be analyzed. The Info tab in the strongUtilities/strong window and the associated tools for Logging, Frame Capture, Wi-Fi Scan and Performance allow me to troubleshoot most wireless situations.   I have also added an Aerohive AP121 router to my toolset and that allows near real time FFT graphical spectrum analysis of tricky radio situations, but that's a bit of overkill for wanting an OS X tool to begin to tease apart challenging wireless environments.  No answer seems to let me control the OS X / radio software stack to force a connection or operation on one of the frequency bands, though so the answer seems to be no at the moment (as well as for quite some time).  <comment26776> I am really looking to get at the radio on the mac. This would allow me to ignore all the b/g clutter if I want to see the one or two 802.11a routers. Also, for interference testing, I want to _know_ I'm measuring the n band and not have my mac hop to a lower channel - I need it to fail when it's pinned to one channel for the testing to be accurate. <comment27662> Thanks! I'll keep this in mind - I wasn't aware of this tidbit and perhaps can exploit it in an indirect manner by getting as close to the network I prefer. It clearly won't work for dual band routers... I can't always depend on the channel I want to force my hardware being the strongest signal, but you've got me one step closer to a good solution. <comment28039> Very nice link - I'll keep that in mind if I need more details. `airport --getinfo` and `airport --scan` currently work for my needs. Does Kismac do more than just interpreting the airport scan data that I can see from the command line? <comment28047> Yes, much more, including some common WEP attacks. There's a [feature list](http://trac.kismac-ng.org/). <comment28321> Wow - this is really a great tool. It's not what I need now - but I'll certainly give it a try in the future. <comment28322> I'm choosing this for the bounty as I've already got `/System/Library/CoreServices/Wi-Fi Diagnostics` for the pretty graphs and frame debugging. The airport command is the tool that would be able to set the radio - but it's documentation is lacking and it appears to be in transition to a new format. Thanks to all who answered. <comment28323> Also the [Network Link Conditioner](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24066/how-to-simulate-slow-internet-connections-on-the-mac) is great alternative to `ipfw` for light strikepranking/strike _testing_. <comment44881> Might you have any insight into this other question, cksum? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/38125/airport-looking-for-networks-affects-firewire-audio-device - that OP is looking to hack at the guts of airport cards too <comment67392> What exactly is **JoinMode=Ranked**? It is documented anywhere quasi-offically? <comment161080> why sudo? Network joining should be available for the regular user, right? <comment284433> bmike I'm also looking to do the same thing. Did you ever find a solution?
