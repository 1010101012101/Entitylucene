Is this impossible to install XP using BootCamp on Lion? <body> I want to install XP with bootcamp on my Mac running Lion. The only choice that it gives me is to install Win7. Is there a way to install XP on Lion ?  <answer69564> ol liIn Bootcamp: You can bypass it by putting in a Windows7 disk and format the drive for the Windows installation./li liAfter that you just restart, press alt to bring up the boot menu and put in your Windows XP CD to install./li /ol  One way that should work aswell(havent tested) is if you just create a new empty FAT-partition and then go to step 2.
