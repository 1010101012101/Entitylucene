Alternative to additemtodock from Henri Shustak <body> I am using a commandline script to add items to the dock via scripts  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23653/add-item-to-dock  But it seems to have a lot of bugs and maybe even "kills" my Dock config file. Are there any good alternatives out there to add *.app properly to the dock ?  <answer64309> Open strongApplications / Utilities / AppleScript Editor/strong and paste this:  precodemy add_item_to_dock(choose file of type {"APPL"} with prompt "Choose an application to add to the Dock:") on add_item_to_dock(item_path) try         get item_path as alias -- you need a POSIX path so this coerces the path in case it's an HFS path, alias, file ref, etc.         set item_path to POSIX path of item_path     end try     try         tell application "Dock" to quit     end try     do shell script "defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;tile-data&lt;/key&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;file-data&lt;/key&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;_CFURLString&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;" &amp; item_path &amp; "&lt;/string&gt;&lt;key&gt;_CFURLStringType&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;'"     try         tell application "Dock" to activate     end try end add_item_to_dock /code/pre  Save it as emScript/em or emApplication/em.  <comment75494> Can i directly use it in my "normal" shell script as function ? Or won't it work because its apple script <comment75495> To Run and AppleScript from shell you'll need to use the `osascript` command. You can either call the AppleScript directly (`osascript -e 'applescript command'`) or run the script (`osascript script.scpt`). If you are parsing the AppleScript directly, you'll need to *rephrase* it so it can be run in one line. <comment75496> You can also include newlines in the argument after `-e`, get the script from stdin, or use a HEREDOC. <comment213210> Do you have the latest version?
