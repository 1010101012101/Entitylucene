bindfs, osfuse, sshfs & macOS Sierra <body> I use bindfs with osxfuse and sshfs to mount specific folders (chroot) to allow sftp access for external users (macOS Sierra 10.12).   Binding a readOnly folder for the user "sftpusr" is done with  precodebindfs -r -u sftpusr /volume/folder /chroot/folder /code/pre  The folder is correctly bound, I can login using sftp and listing the folder once only - then folders and files disappear, I need to mount and bind again.    There is no difference in using either homebrew to install osfuse, sshfs, bindfs or making my "own" binaries.  I had this feature running for years (Mavericks, Yosemite). Is this an incompatibility with macOS Sierra?  <answer256426> I had no luck getting bindfs and osfuse up and running with macOS Sierra. So I configured a virtual machine instead on top of CentOS 7, with everything running now.  https://bernhard.hensler.net/sftp-yosemite-server/  <comment319282> Please add (a) related error message(s) (from the various log files) <comment319363> I can't find anything in /var/log/* which would point to a bindfs, osfuse or sshfs error; the first attempt to read a bindfs folder is good, the second shows an empty folder only. bindfs is still active as a I cannot mount a folder again without having umounted, as this error message point out.  fuse: failed to mount file system: Undefined error: 0 mount_osxfuse: mount point /sftp/folder is itself on a OSXFUSE volume <comment319826> Do you have a quick how-to/receipt (e.g. a link) how to set up the services or is it as easy as installing all three (with homebrew) and it works? Then I will install it in a OS X VM and do my best to solve your problem! <comment319911> OK I installed it and got it to work locally but not via remote sftp user: `sudo bindfs -o local,allow_other,debug,volname=DefaultWeb -u sftpuser /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default /chroot/sftpuser/scratchpad` (just a reminder)
