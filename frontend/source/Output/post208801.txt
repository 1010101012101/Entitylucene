How can I upgrade to any macOS version that is no longer available in the Apple app store? <body> I am using a Mac Mini (Late 2012) that is running macOS 10.9.5 (Mavericks). I avoided upgrading to macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) when it was first released because of all of the stability issues surrounding it and have stuck to macOS 10.9.5. Never “purchased” or even attempted to download it via the Apple app store.  Now that macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) has been released, what can I do to upgrade to macOS 10.10.5 if/when I wish to? When I am in the Apple app store the only option I see macOS 10.11 as an upgrade option; screenshot below.  The logic is, I assume that macOS 10.10.5 is more stable that macOS 10.10 when it was first released, so I would like to put a 10.10.5 upgrade on my plate of options if/when I have the time and patience to deal with. I would like to avoid macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) for a while if possible.  Is my only option at this point to download a macOS 10.10.5 installer from some non-Apple website somewhere or does Apple have any accommodations to allow end-users to download macOS 10.10.5 from them in some way?  I see this OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 Update as well as this OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 Combo Update is available for download, but would any/either of those be useful to someone like me running macOS 10.9.5 in any way? I assume those updates are only useful for someone already running 10.10 already, correct?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YfZAR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer208823> As soon as a new Mac OS is released, the previous one becomes unavailable.  The only way to get an older OS directly from Apple is to have previously 'purchased it' - even if it was free - then it will appear in your purchase history in the App Store.   If it's not in your purchase history, then you'll have to get it from a trustworthy friend [or less-trustworthy torrent etc]    10.10.emanything/em will do, as you can still get the combo updater to 10.10.5  It's always wise to get a new OS download, even if you don't intend to install it right now - just so it's always in your history.  I have every OS back to Lion in my purchase history - good for if I ever need a disposable OS for testing etc.  hr  As Sierra will not run on older machines, this rule has been relaxed for machines whose last supported OS is El Capitan.br You can download it from here - https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12 - but it will not run if your machine is capable of running Sierra.br If it is capable, then you are back to needing it in your purchase history already.  <answer228551> If you don't have an older version of OSX in your purchase history, another option is to get it from an Apple retail store. Just make an appointment with the Genius Bar, take your computer in (even mac pro/mini/imac), and they can connect an ethernet cable and install any version of OSX from their servers, at least as far back as 10.6. They did if for free when I had it done about 9 months ago, and it was much faster than installing it at home. I believe it only took about 20 minutes.  <answer284914> The currently existing answers don't answer the questions posed in your last paragraph, so I'll cover that here.  The update pages you link to have small clickable text at the bottom giving strongSystem Requirements/strong.  These system requirements clarify that the "OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 Update" only works if you have 10.10.4 already installed, and that the "OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 Combo Update" only works if you have some previous version of Yosemite installed, i.e. 10.10.x.  Neither can be used to upgrade from Mavericks or any other earlier version of OSX.  strongNote/strong: I originally failed to notice the System Requirements link, so this answer has been changed from a previous incorrect one.  <comment251787> Look at the System Requirements on the pages you linked, it answers the question regarding that.  As far as downloading OS X 10.10.x from the App Store, if you've never downloaded it before then you'll not be able to download it from the App Store now that OS X 10.11 has been released.  If you have, then it will be available under Purchased. <comment251789> @user3439894 I am aware of the content of those links, but the question is designed to be as through as possible so responses aren’t tons of “Did you do this/that/other?” nonsense. <comment252002> Welp… C'est la vie! <comment268865> Just an update: Thanks to a consulting gig I was able to get a copy of Mac OS X 10.10.5 (Yosemite) and do an upgrade. The worst part was the initial upgrade itself—1 minute left = 30 minutes left—in Apple installer time, but past that I am quite happy. Thanks for the solid advice! <comment278673> THANK YOU SO MUCH. I didn't realize I could get it from my purchases! My brother had downloaded it while I had downloaded El Capitan. <comment359540> I've removed the comments, please use a chat room for further discussions about the merits of this answer.
