How to setup macOS Server VPN through gateway <body> I am trying to setup up my Mac Mini Server with VPN service for the office MacBooks.   Being that the Mac Mini is not the gateway, our public IP does not resolve to the Mac Mini but instead to the gateway. So on the gateway (pfSense), I set up NAT for the ports listed in the Access tab of the Server.app. I also exported the configuration from the profile manager and everything looks good. I don't know what else to try? Is it because dhcp server is on the gateway, not the server?  Thanks for your help  <comment372690> I'm very confused. The NAT was fine. It was when I removed the configuration profile and added the macOS Server account manually. Then, it connected in one go. <comment372691> Oh I apologize - I misunderstood your question. Unfortunately I donâ€™t have any insights into that kind of problem. I will poke around and let you know if I find something <comment372692> You didn't misunderstand. I thought it was the NAT too but it was setup correctly. I don't understand why the .mobileconfig files are different than using Open Directory <comment372700> I don't either. Honestly, because my VPNs are for use for a limited number of people, I've just set them up manually.
