Inkscape (or other XQuartz) window disappears when using external screen <body> I have this issue where Inkscape does not appear when my MacBook Pro is plugged to an external screen. I tried several windows management tools (like Spectable, or Stay) but these did not work for the XQuartz app.  <answer235280> It seems like the issue is that when I plug the external screen, it messes with the coordinate system of my Mac's screen, effectively shifting the origin of my screen by the resolution of the external screen.  In other words, from the point of view of XQuartz the origin of my Mac's screen changes from 0,0 to 2560,1440 (which is the resolution of my external screen).  This means that if Inkscape is somewhere near origin (0,0) but still associated with my Mac's main screen then it doesn't appear on the external screen nor in my main screen. It is basically in "limbo" between the 2 screens.  The solution is to move the Inkscape window to a new coordinate that takes into account the size of the external screen, and this is where codewmctrl/code comes in useful:  precodebrew install homebrew/x11/wmctrl wmctrl -r Inkscape -e 0,2560,1440,1200,700 /code/pre  Of course you need to replace code2560,1440/code with your own external screen's resolution and code1200,700/code to suit your main screen resolution.  In order to make it more convenient I created 2 alias, to fix the coordinates for my Mac screen and for the external screen, respectively:  precodealias fixInkscape='wmctrl -r Inkscape -e 0,2560,1440,1200,700' alias fixInkscapeExt='wmctrl -r Inkscape -e 0,0,0,2560,1300' /code/pre  Remember that each alias only works for the screen that Inkscape is associated with, you still need to drag-and-drop the window in order to switch screens. codewmctrl/code won't do it automatically, but it certainly helps in "fishing" it from limbo.  <answer290660> This worked for me:  Go to System preferences - Displays and untick the box next to "Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available".  <answer294736> This worked for me when working with Inkscape:  ul liClose XQuartz (and Inkscape)/li liChange the Mission Control Preferences (unselect Display have separate spaces)/li liLog out/li liStart Inkscape/li liChange the Windows Inkscape preferences (Edit/ Preferences) to "Don't save Windows Geometry"/li liClose Inkscape end XQuartz/li liReset the Mission Control Preferences (if you like)/li liLog out and back in./li /ul  All the credits to:  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/eggbotuser/48RbZ2Pey5A  I have two monitors and OSX Sierra and Inkscape 0.92.2.
