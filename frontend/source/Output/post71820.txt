How can I (re)create development and build tools on a corrupt installation? <body> On my previous computer I had Xcode working nicely; on my present computer, with Homebrew installed, gcc and make are present in /Developer/usr/bin but not /usr/bin. On the whole when I try to download and build http://JonathansCorner.com/download/tms1_4.tar.gz, I can find bits and pieces of the tools used to do things, but when invoked from its present path it doesn't recognize #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; type includes.  How can I reinstall Xcode, Homebrew, and anything else to get a fresh and working build so I can run make &amp;&amp; make install?  <answer89779> Reinstalling XCode and updating Homebrew should be enough. To do this:  ul liTry the codeuninstall-devtools/code script from this answer to remove older XCode versions. (If it doesn't work or you can't find it, don't worry about it.)/li liDelete the entire /Developer directory if it exists. This is where older versions of XCode live./li liDownload and install the latest XCode for your OS version. (The App Store makes this easy.)/li liInstall the Command Line Tools. In XCode, go to the Apple menu, select Preferences, select the Downloads section, and click Install next to Command Line Tools./li liUpdate the Homebrew definitions and packages with codebrew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade/code.  ul liIf any brewed packages still seem broken, codebrew rm/code them and codebrew install --fresh/code to reinstall./li /ul/li liEdit your shell config file (e.g. code~/.bashrc/code) to make sure code/usr/local/bin/code is on your path. codebrew doctor/code can help diagnose this and other issues./li /ul  Note that codetms/code is designed to install to code/usr/lib/code by default, which you won't have permissions to do in a normal OS X setup even once you have all the tools installed, because the OS reserves code/usr/code for its own use. You'll probably want to fiddle with the codeMakefile/code and codetms.h/code to get it in to code/usr/local/code or code/opt/code, which are easier places to drop user-built packages.  If you're feeling ambitious, you could even do codebrew create http://jonathanscorner.com/download/tms1_4.tar.gz/code to make a Homebrew formula for TMS, making repeated installs easier.  <comment105457> Very good advice. I might make a plug to run the perl script that [uninstalls the packages and then files that were installed from Xcode.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/71662/how-to-can-i-upgrade-xcode-4-1-to-4-5-2-properly) It's slightly cleaner, but won't touch your code or libraries - just cleans the Apple tools and directories. <comment105459> That's a good idea, for hygiene. Adding that as an item in my answer. <comment105462> Now that's a great answer. If only I had more than one up vote. <comment105463> Aw shucks, now you're making me blush.
