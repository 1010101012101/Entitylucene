Hide an application's dock icon <body> Is there an easy way to hide an application's dock icon?  For example, I can't hide Iconfactory xScope dock icon. Most similar apps a preference settings to hide the dock icon, but I can't seem to find one in this app's preferences.  <answer11593> There are apps that let you hide any app's dock icon. The ones I've heard of are Dock Dodger and Dockless (both available for free).  Keep in mind that any of these apps will also hide an app's menu bars (ï£¿, emapp/em, File, Edit, etc.). This is unavoidable, as best I can tell. brNote that xScope's menu bar app (on the right, with Spotlight) will stay.  <answer11633> Try editing the app's plist (inside the .app package i.e codexScope.app/Contents/Info.plist/code)  and add or edit the following entry:  precode&lt;key&gt;NSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  Because this hides the menu bars, it should be possible to create a keyboard shortcut in codeSystem Preferences&gt;Keyboard&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts/code for any functionality that you need the menus for.  <answer243881> Edit Info.plist inside the .app  (for example Xcode.app)br You can access contents of an App bybr /SecondClick (RightClick)/Show Package Contentsbr for example    Xcode.app/Contents/Info.plist    add this key:    precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  reference: I just updated a calendar App that had this dock problem, In the new version it is solved. I saved the older .app file and compared .plist in both versions of the same App.  <comment12176> This hides the dock icon but also hides the app's menu bar which makes some features unusable (such as creating a new Guide line). <comment12189> @titanium There's no way to hide the dock icon without hiding the menu bar. This has been asked before on other sites, and no one's ever gotten past the menu bar problem. <comment12226> I don't have a copy of xScope so I'm not aware of all the side effects of not accessing the menu, my solution has all the same effects of the Dock Dodger or Dockless solutions, because I believe they are more or less GUI's for the edits shown in this answer. <comment12227> I'm marking your answer as accepted since I don't think there is a good solution to my question. <comment301451> See also  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/130390/hide-adium-or-any-other-apps-icon-in-the-dock <comment301454> defaults write /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Info.plist LSUIElement true
