Will a high end MacBook be up to the job of developing iOS apps? <body> I'm thinking about getting a 3.6Gh capable MacBook with 16G ram.  I use it to develop apps with Xcode on the go (airplane, trains etc.)  Is this a bad choice? I'm using a 13 inch MacBook Pro right now with only 8GB of ram and it's sufficient but nothing impressive, and when the luggage gets heavier, one really, really wants to shed that extra 1 or 2 pounds.  Is the video card any good also?  <comment373642> Welcome to Ask Different.  This might not be a good fit once you narrow this down to one question, but can you edit this to define what “any good” or how you develop? People develop of 5 and 10 year old Mac, so the idea that any machine isn’t good enough is very relative and sometimes opinion based.
