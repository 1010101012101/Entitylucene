iTunes 12.2 xml file is not present after upgrading my OS X to 10.10.4 and iTunes to 12.2 <body> After upgrading my Mac OSX to 10.10.4 and iTunes to 12.2, the iTunes music library XML file is not created under /users/music/iTunes folder. I tried creating the xml file manually, but it gets deleted after 5-10 seconds automatically. Any workaround to resolve this problem?  <answer194255> iTunes 12.2 definitely still generates an codeiTunes Music Library.xml/code file. From my machine, running 10.10.4 and iTunes 12.2:  pre ~/Music/iTunes$ ls -l "iTunes Music Library.xml" -rw-r--r--@ 1 mj  staff  109833070 Jul  2 14:20 iTunes Music Library.xml /pre  That date and time stamp are the date and time I last exited iTunes.  That said, you can recreate the XML file. Apple has document HT201561 that describes the process as well as the purpose of the XML file and when it gets recreated, but note all of the warnings in that document.   strongUpdate:/strong The generation of the XML is now optional in iTunes 12.2 - check emPreferences/em  emAdvanced/em and set the option emShare iTunes Library XML with other applications/em  <answer194270> It seems like they don't save the xml file by default anymore. You have to turn it on in iTunes' preferences.             <comment231607> it probably moved to another place. try searching for it with "mdfind iTunes Music Library.xml" in your terminal app. <comment231608> Tried that as well, but did not work. I could not find any other iTunes music library.xml file in my machine. Also, if I create it manually by doing library export, it gets removed automatically after around 10 seconds. <comment231609> it would help if you disclose what you have tried already. <comment231626> I mean, along with whatever I tried already as mentioned in the description, I tried what you have suggested - that also did not solve the problem. Thanks for asking me to be more precise. <comment231707> Not sure if this is related, but might be worth a tryâ€¦ http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/194246/after-upgrading-itunes-all-my-media-has-disappeared <comment324650> See also [HT201610](http://web.archive.org/web/20160104232229/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201610) that explains the switch to optional.
