Group windows in Mac OS X <body> Is there a way to group 2 or more windows so that they act together? If I drag one, they all move. If I hide one, they all hide. If I alt-tab to one, they all come in focus, etc.  These windows might be in different applications   <answer50187> I do believe I understand what you are requesting, and actually find it very interesting. However, this functionality does not exist in the strongbase OS/strong itself (10.5.x | 10.6.x | 10.7.x). An alternative to grouping windows in OS X, that you be interested in, is to utilize Mission Control (10.7) and Expose. In strongMission Control/strong you can add a new Desktop and drag your window(s)/Applications into that new Desktop thereby grouping them. They do not have to be like items and this can be done a number of times. Expose does not really cover what you have requested, but still is beneficial in terms of grouping stronglike/strong items.  <answer51480> Have you seen Optimal Layout? I've never used it so I can't comment from experience, but the features list in the Mac App Store states:     Windows can STICK TOGETHER   So, it might have the functionality you're looking for.  <comment57530> That might work. Then I would be switching Desktop to different tools rather than cmd-tabbing through them, yes? <comment57531> @Drew That is correct. :â€“) <comment58836> @Drew have you found that Mission Control successfully does what you were wanting? <comment138446> Optimal Layout does window switching and movement, not what is being asked here.
