What are some undocumented iPhone features? <body> With included documentation as sparse as Apple's, there are plenty of them...  <answer655> Safari: hit the status bar (where the time, battery etc is displayed) to scroll to the top of the page.  <answer679> Scenario: You are trying to take a picture of yourself (and perhaps a friend), so you have the phone turned around, and you cant seem to hit the "shutter" button to take a picture.  Tip: Hold your finger on the "shutter" button, turn the phone around, and when you are ready to take a picture remove your finger. The picture will be taken when you remove your finger. This is much easier than the "old" approach.  <answer689> If you've come around a good picture in your safari browser and sadly there's no option to save the image, you can do it via, screenshot feature in iPhone. Just hold the power button on top of iPhone and while holding it, just press Home button once. You'll get the screenshot of your iPhone screen which you can edit later easily with Photoshop Express.  http://mobile.photoshop.com/iphone/  Hope it helps. :)  <answer692> Starting from iOS4, while listening to music in iPod app the screen turns on for a second to show what song is currently playing. It won't happen if the iPhone is in your pocket.  <answer1716> Double clicking the home button strongin iOS4/strong shows a custom task bar with your recently used and emstill running/em multi-tasked apps. Click and hold to close them one by one.

One less tap!  <answer1720> If you slide your finger from right to left in a Podcast the "Delete" button appears.  emoriginally submitted by Eduardo Molteni on Super User./em  <answer1721> You can take screenshots by pressing the strongHome + Lock (Sleep)/strong buttons.

If you only want to type one number or symbol, though, you can tap and hold the [.?123] key, drag to the number or symbol you want, then let go. You'll get the symbol and you'll immediately snap back to letter mode.  emoriginally submitted by Herb Caudill on Super User./em  <answer1724> If you hold your finger down on a link in Safari then you can open the linked page in a new "tab".  emoriginally submitted by John Topley on Super User./em  <answer1725> You can tap the status bar at the top of the screen to jump to the top of a web page or message.  emoriginally submitted by Herb Caudill on Super User./em  <answer1726> In 3.0, you can hold down the hyphen key on the keyboard to get an em dash character. Similarly hold down the period to get an ellipsis. You can also hold down keys such as "a" or "e" to get accented versions of those letters.  emoriginally submitted by John Topley on Super User./em  <answer1727> In the Mail application you can select the portion of text that you want to quote. Hit the Reply button and the selection will appear at the end of the email, instead of the whole original message.  emoriginally submitted by John Topley on Super User./em  <answer1728> In the maps app you don't have to pinch to zoom in and out. Double tapping zooms in and tapping with two fingers zooms out.  This makes it much easier when you are using the phone with one hand.  emoriginally submitted by andynormancx on Super User./em  <answer1729> In 3.0, you can adjust the scrubbing speed through a song by touching the scrubbing slider, then moving your finger emdown/em on the screen. Different distances from the scrubbing bar mean different (slower) scrubbing speeds.  While it's not exactly private browsing, you can clear your Safari history, cookies, and cache from the Settings application in the Safari menu.  The Home button (when pressed in the Springboard) by default will send you to the first screen of applications. However, if you press Home, wait for the first page of apps to be displayed, then press Home again, the Search screen will be presented. Subsequent presses will toggle back and forth between the first apps page and the Search page. (Note that you have to delay slightly between presses, otherwise the two-press shortcut will kick in and launch some other app (iPod by default)).  emoriginally submitted by Tim on Super User./em  <answer1730> In 3.0, when editing some text, shake the phone to get the option undo your edits. To redo your edits, just shake the phone again.  emoriginally submitted by andynormancx on Super User./em  <answer1731> I've just discovered that if you scroll to the top of the list of Contacts in the Phone app, your own phone number is listed above the search field.  emoriginally submitted by John Topley on Super User./em  <answer1732> Go to Settings-General-Keyboard, and turn on Enable Caps Lock. When typing the shift key will still behave as before, but now you will have the option to double-tap it to turn on Caps-Lock (shift key will turn blue). Useful for acronyms, and shouting.  emoriginally submitted by jwaddell on Super User./em  <answer1733> Special characters on the keyboard.  ul liHold down E, Y, U, I, O, A, S, L, Z, C, or N to bring up accented letters/li liHold down $ in the number/symbol keyboard to display other currency symbols/li liHold down “ or ‘ in the number/symbol keyboard to access alternative quote characters/li liHold down ? or ! in the number/symbol keyboard to bring up the ¿ or ¡ symbol/li liHold down the .com key when entering Web addresses to bring up options for .net, .edu and .org.

(If the iPod is already playing, it always takes you to iPod controls).  emoriginally submitted by Herb Caudill on Super User./em  <answer1736> You can have more than the 11 screen limit for apps. If you add them, they won't be displayed, but will still be installed on the phone.   You can still get to them by using a spotlight search for the app name and launch them, even though they're not visible.  emoriginally submitted by Mark Struzinski on Super User./em  <answer1737> You can double tap the shift to keep caps lock on.br Tap just below the seek/scrub bar to hide/show it.  emoriginally submitted by e11world on Super User./em  <answer1738> You can remove individual text messages from a conversation by clicking the Edit button in the top right-hand corner of the Messages app.  emoriginally submitted by John Topley on Super User./em  <answer1739> Double tapping the space key ends a sentence by filling in a period.   emoriginally submitted by Sathya on Super User./em  <answer1740> You can play videos even when the phone is locked.  Sometimes I listen to video podcasts, where all I am interested in is the audio. When doing this, if you lock the phone the podcast stops playing.  However, you can start the podcast playing again even with the phone locked. Just double press the home key to bring up the iPod controls and then press play.  hr  emoriginally submitted by andynormancx on Super User./em  <answer1741> Everyone knows about pinch to zoom in/out on Google Maps. Many people know that they can double-tap to zoom in.  Did you know that you can do strongtwo-finger-tap to zoom out/strong? So useful when driving with iPhone mounted on dash.  <answer1742> You can listen to any audio that is being streamed through Quicktime in Safari (.mp3, .m3u, .pls etc files) in the background.  Start the stream via a link in Safari.app, and then hit the home button and the audio will continue to play.  This was very notable pre-iOS4, not sure if it worked pre iOS3 though.  <answer1743> Since the screen is multitouch, you can hold the codeShift/code key while typing other keys to type them in uppercase (just like a real keyboard).  <answer1744> Since the 3GS, you can use the headphones remote button to stop/start video recording  <answer1745> I learnt this just last month and I can't believe I haven't known this before.  If you're going outside of your timezone and the phone is connected to the local GSM provider, it will change the clock of your phone automatically!  <answer3275> In Maps, you can switch to street view by dropping a pin, tapping it, and then tapping the little orange guy.  <answer3908> VoiceControl has some undocumented features:  ul liIf you have multiple phone numbers for people, you can say which phone number to call, 'call John Smith home', 'call Davey Jones mobile'./li liIf you have assigned nicknames, you can use them too 'call wife', 'call dad'/li /ul  <answer3913> You can use two fingers to scroll through iframes and divs on web pages in Mobile Safari.

It might be documented somewhere, but I'm surprised how few people know about this. Screenshot is of iPad, but it works the same on iPhone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0PoP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer132026> To quickly access your draft email messages, press and hold the new email button on the toolbar. A new dialog appears showing "New Message" and an option plus all of your draft emails.  <comment575> Works in a lot of apps too, not just Safari.  Very handy for long lists. <comment1506> Good question; bad grammar. "With included documentation as *spare* as Apple's, *there are* plenty of them." <comment1507> Ooops, changed :) <comment1508> Should probably be community wiki, since you make a list of features. <comment1509> For reference, all useful answers from the previous Super User question [Hidden features of the iPhone](http://superuser.com/questions/5940/hidden-features-of-the-iphone) (now deleted) have been copied to this question. <comment1510> Aren't ALL of the features undocumented? I've never heard of a documented iPhone feature. It is intuitive, who needs manuals, right? (pffft) <comment1511> When you ask users to contribute to a list of answers, the question should be community wiki. I converted this question. <comment1512> Nice cut and paste job from SU Gnoupi, thanks :) <comment1513> Not on my iPhone. Double-home goes to phone favourites, or iPod controls if it's playing. Pressing home once when you're already on the home screen goes to the search page.  There is a jailbreak app that puts recent apps on the search page, I have no idea what it's called (even though I'm running it). <comment1514> This is an iOS4 feature <comment1515> Make that iOS4 running on a 3GS or above <comment1516> It is iOS4, edited my answer to reflect - gimme back that vote ;) <comment1517> Gave you mine.           3 comment length restrictions.  3 1 comment per 15 seconds restriction too. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 <comment1518> But is this feature hidden at all? This is shown in presentation videos on the apple website ... <comment1519> It's not necessarily a iPhone feature; it's more of a feature that many applications have, right? <comment1520> Actually, it is built in to the standard table-view control provided by iOS, so developers don't have to do anything special to make it happen.  Thus, practically any application that has a "scrolling list" will have this feature, unless the developer really screwed up. <comment1521> The same is true for the shift key; press-slide-release instead of tap-tap to get an uppercase letter. <comment1522> duplicate of my answer <comment1523> You can't access the Field Test Mode in iOS4. <comment1524> And triple-tap to zoom out. When you use this double/triple-tap, you jump from one true scale to the next, avoiding muddy images that occur in between true scale steps. <comment1525> Only works when accessing the Contacts through the Phone app. In the Contacts app itself, your number is not displayed. <comment1526> holding down the .com key will also display country-specific extensions for your locale e.g. .co.uk <comment1527> And if it's not currently playing, press Home *thrice* to get the same controls. <comment1528> (Does not work on my iPod Touch 2nd Gen with iOS 4.) Sorry, it DOES work, but only if you activate scroll lock in the keyboard settings (as posted somewhere below). <comment1529> Also auto-capitalizes the first letter of the next sentence. <comment1530> You mean three-finger-tap, not two-finger. <comment1531> 2-finger tap on maps to zoom out. I do mean 2. 3-finger tap doesn't do anything on maps on my iPhone. <comment1532> fairly obvious 'feature' <comment1533> double tapping shift leaves it active to save you a bit of RSI <comment1534> @3rdparty -- Not obvious to me; I never knew that <comment1535> That's usual behaviour for modern cell phones. The last 2 or 3 phones i have been using could do that. <comment2159> +1: I love this tip - I had my phone for almost a year before I realized it was there! <comment2160> +1: cool, the world needs more ems <comment2595> How do you tap with two fingers using only one hand? :) <comment2596> Needs to be enabled in settings first. <comment3672> Also, these apps aren't always 'still running', they just have their states saved in memory. <comment3680> You can't in 4.0. You can in 4.1 (barely meaningfully). You can in 4.2. <comment3714> A lot of these answers are documented: http://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/ <comment3736> Although it seems quicker just to type .com than wait for the hover selector to appear. <comment3737> Or just hold your finger on the image until a save and copy button appears. <comment3738> Another reason why the contacts app is a waste of space. <comment4058> No longer works in iOS 4 on multi-tasking enabled devices. <comment5416> @Robert and how new users can make Community Wiki anyway? I don't see how I could in my case. <comment5544> @Cawas: That feature has been removed. If a question should be made community wiki, more often than not, it's simply a poor question. But, for that rare occasion that a question should be make community wiki, flag it for moderator attention. <comment5551> @Robert makes a lot of sense (to me after knowing more about SE community). thanks! <comment7223> Seems obvious, but it took me an embarrassingly long time to notice the latter two! <comment7232> I tried it, but not working. The Orange guy is not highlighted when I tap the pin. (it still shows me the location) <comment7291> This happens in almost any list where items can be deleted. <comment13779> The bonus of using this method to get your ellipsis is that it does not autocapitalize after it.  Try typing 3 periods and you get it followed by a Cap if you have autocap enabled. <comment18852> @Kristopher Johnson, not "table-view" but any scroll view. <comment23297> Is is only hidden for people that don't have any umlauts (americans etc.). For everybody else, this is day to day business... <comment23298> Nice trick, +1. Btw: in iOS 5, you can use the volume-up-button to take a picture. <comment41039> didn't know this, will be using it from now on! <comment48820> I really wish it stayed on and didn't unlock after punctuation though. <comment91985> Enable in Settings-General-Keyboard-Enable Caps Lock. <comment190974> you also can in iOS 8.1.2 <comment244159> In iOS 8 and above, holding your finger on the shutter triggers burst mode, so you will need to use the volume buttons instead.
