Alter cmd-tab behaviour on OSX to group Parallels applications? <body> When running a Parallels virtual machine (i.e. Windows 7), cmd-tab behaves as the Parallels icon showing the list of virtual machines (which can be closed) and a separate icon for each open Windows application.  It would improve my productivity for Windows to appear as a single icon that just switches to whatever is open on my Windows VM. How do I do this?  I am running OSX 10.9 and Parallels 9.  <answer112597> Try (ctrl - left alt - tab) &amp; (right alt - tab) should do the trick…  Well it does it using VMware where you can also change inside "strongVMWare/strong" menu "strongPreferences…/strong "strongKeyboard &amp; Mouse/strong" pane the key mappings to give priority either to the VM or the host. I don't see why it wouldn't be the same with Parallels…  <answer179198> You must deselect the "Share Windows applications with Mac" option in the Applications pane of your VM's configuration. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WKYH1.png" alt="enter image description here"
