What is the keyboard shortcut to set the language for text in MS Word 2011? <body> I usually write in English, but I often quote things in other languages like German or French. I know that you can set the language, like the font under Tools - Language. Is there a keyboard shortcut to make this easier?  <answer187154> Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts and there will be various shortuc setups for almost anything. If you see something that is not listed, Make a service in Automator and add it as shortcut:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1A9mR.png" alt="enter image description here" Here you see the service in Automator. It ain't always have to be an AppleScript. You can chose other services from the Menu on the left.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nkwYc.png" alt="enter image description here" And here is a screenshot of enabling the service and assigning a shortcut by double clicking the shortucts on right, and pressing a combination of keys.  hr  here is a full tutorial on services and automation as a little bonus to the question.  <comment221032> You can go to System Preferences  Keyboard and setup shortcuts for nearly anything. If change this preference does not show up, You can use an automator service <comment221155> @thebro21 that did the trick! I should have thought of that. I found that Ctrl+Option+Cmd +L worked well for this on word (ie. No conflicting shortcuts)
