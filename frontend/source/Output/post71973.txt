Any way to write the Terminal scrollback history? <body> I would like to open a new tab in Terminal with custom scrollback history. The primary use-case is to "fork" an existing tab such that both tabs contain the same scrollback history, but more generally I would like to have some custom scripts save and restore Terminal sessions.  I know about the history restore functionality already in Terminal but it doesn't suit my needs; the main one being that I have a system built around the codescript/code command and some codezsh/code hooks to save history and output for all terminal sessions for later auditing purposes (recalling changes that I've made).   I would now like to switch to use codeosascript/code to save the history and on restoring sessions later to match up the new session with its prior one- in a way, implementing long-term, persistent sessions. I've had Terminal's saved sessions lose their data too many times that I am working around it.  <answer77118> Perhaps use iterm? http://www.iterm2.com  Its free and should fit your needs?  <comment89077> There's no way to detach and reattach screen to suit your needs? <comment89428> If you wanted to go so far as to state that this will absolutely 100% solve the problem - that would be a fine answer by saying to pick another package, but if there is doubt to whether another software package works, that would be best as a comment and not an answer. <comment132645> from what i can ascertain iTerm does NO "restoration" of the scrollback history... which sucks cause it's a nice feature of the otherwise pretty lame Apple `Terminal.app`
