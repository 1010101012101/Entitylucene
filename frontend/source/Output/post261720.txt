Safari slow page loading <body> Shortly after I updated to macOS Sierra Safari started to load pages (on the internet as well as sites in my local network) so slow that sometimes pages don't load in a hour. But occasionally sites get loaded in "normal" speed, a behavior which I cannot replicate.  The same appears on another users safari and the tech preview of Safari, but not in Chrome/Opera.
