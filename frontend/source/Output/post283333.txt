Font Size tiny on Mail App on iPhone after updating to 10.3.1 <body> I just got a new iPhone using 10.3.1 and noticed that (although most of my emails are fine) the emails that contain an embedded image have tiny fonts to the point that you can't read. My older phones seemed to shrink the image and leave the font alone but it seems that iOS 10.3.1 leaves the image alone and shrinks the fonts.   I've tried numerous recommendations around resetting and thread changes as well as increasing font size but none of that seem to work for me.  The only quick fix that I found is to take the email that has the image and then start to forward it, and then the text appears readable and then cancel the forward. This is a painful process. Any ideas?
