How to write a function in Numbers to get the DATES for different tasks <body> I am trying to figure out how to write a function to get Dates going on and back from a different moments in my to-do spreadsheet. I know that i can use function DATEVALUE() to count from one specific cell by adding or subtracting to get the rest of the dates. But if that cell(date) is not specific. In example I want one time to give a date for flower stage and let Numbers count the rest and another time give a date for fruit stage, then i would need to rewrite the hole spreadsheet for that.  Example tomato sickle:  date1 - seed  date2 - leaf  date3 - flower  date4 - plant  date5 - fruit  I want to enter the date for any of the stages and lat the Numbers count the rest of the dates. Any ideas how to do this?
