Meaning of MAC terminal command prompt <body> I was wondering if anyone could explain the meaning the command below in mac terminal:  dhcp-74-148:~   Noticed it for the first time today and just wondering what it meant.  Thanks  <answer156852> That line is called command prompt.  codedhcp-74-148/code is you hostname that you received from dhcp server.  code~/code is where you currently are (which directory) - tilda means you are in your home folder, /Users/[username]  code:/code just separates hostname from current directory.  You can change format of command prompt by changing $PS1 variable. And - if you're interested - check out some bash shell tutorial for more information.  <comment184427> thanks for that answer. I"ll read more about the shell. I just noticed that command for the first time when I opened the terminal today-I've used the terminal before but it was a different command that was there. Still trying to figure out exactly what was there previously. <comment184428> You should be able to change it going to System Preferences  Sharing  Computer Name. It will also be name of your machine others will see if you will share some files or use AirDrop. <comment184430> As for changing the prompt - if - for example - you do export PS1='\[\033[01;34m\]\t \[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h \[\033[01;34m\]\w $\[\033[00m\]', you will have nice green/blue prompt with username and time :) <comment184433> Thanks so much-sry I don't have enough points to +ve rep you. Many thanks. I've figured what was there previously.
