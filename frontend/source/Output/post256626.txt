Ubuntu 14.04 asking password on ssh key login after maxOS Sierra upgrade <body> Yesterday I upgraded to macOS Sierra and this morning when I log-in via SSH to ubuntu 14.04 servers I'm asked for the user password.  This is strange because I have my servers configured for public-key log-in, as explained here:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04  This is not happening with ubuntu 16.04 servers.  At the first time I thought I had been hacked... but it's happening in all servers. Argh what a bad joke.  I would like to be able to log-in again with public SSH key only. I would like to keep the existing public key as I said before I also log in to working ubuntu 16.04 servers, github, etc.  I'm not very experienced with ssh so I'm afraid of break something. How to proceed?  Thank you  <comment320141> You probably don't have your key in your keyring, which got somehow broken with your mac update, as you can see by a lot of report around SO/SE sites. <comment320146> What type of public key? If it is quite old, it may be using a scheme that is no longer supported by LibreSSH (for security reasons). Use the `-vvv` option on the `ssh` command line to see an excessive amount of diagnostics from the key handshake process.
