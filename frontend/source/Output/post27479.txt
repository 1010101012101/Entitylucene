What to do with "There was a problem enabling iCloud Backup" on iPad? <body> I just upgraded to iOS 5 on my iPad and during the intro session it asks you if you want to "back up to iCloud".  Choosing yes, gives the error "There was a problem enabling iCloud Backup".  Any ideas?  <answer27921> The iCloud System Status page lists several problems on 13 October.   Others have said they had the same problem, so maybe one of the troubleshooting pages linked from the iCloud Backup Support page might help?  Later: Yes, it does help. this linked page 'iCloud: troubleshooting creating backups' lists specific error messages and says of yours:     "There was a problem enabling iCloud Backup."       There are various reasons that this can occur. If you receive this alert, wait and try again later. If you receive a more specific alert message as well, make any required adjustments and try again. If you continue to receive this generic alert, contact iCloud Support for assistance.   <comment31546> I think it might be that you don't have enough space to fit the entire backup (by default only 5 Gb), but I'm just guessing <comment31549> @ivo no, I have nothing on my iPad <comment31557> I've had this problem intermittently during the betas as well. Often it just required me to go back into settings, switch off the backup, and then switch it back on. <comment31559> I tried that several times and kept getting the same error @Diago <comment31580> My guess is that this is probably an intermittent problem due to the initial demand for iCloud/initial backups everyone is making.
