Can't acces or find BOOTCAMP drive in mac El Capitan <body> I have a late 2012 iMac running El Capitan and here is how the drive shows in Disk Utility and NTFS Paragon. It also doesn't appear in the Finder sidebar even after i checked all the things in the Finder preferences. The funny thing is that if i log into Windows 10 I can easily acces everything from the mac drive. What can i do to make the BOOTCAMP drive appear and be accesible?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bOQCI.png" alt="enter image description here"   <answer256652> I know this is an old thread, but I had this issue too...    It turns out, the disk was in hibernation mode, and Paragon may have been responsible.  In the emSystem Preferences/em pane, go to emParagon NTFS/em, emVolumes Tab/em, and check the box (Bottom left) that reads : "Disable Paragon NTFS for Mac".  This is what worked for me.  Also, on startup you may get a Paragon notification that says the disk is in hibernation.  Click on that notification before it disappears and another dialogue box will come up that lets you force a mounting of the disk.  This warns you that you will loose temp info from hibernation mode (which is not a big deal).  This is another way to potentially fix it.  <comment261272> It seems that Paragon is ignoring the drive. Also, there is a mount button when you are clicking on it. Have you tried that? <comment261418> Yeah i tried that, mount and also verify does not seem to work. Do you have any other suggestions ? <comment320159> Oh and restart :)
