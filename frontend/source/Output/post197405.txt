2006 macbook give me flashing folder with question mark without disk <body> I am currently using a early 2006 macbook running on os x 10.5 and I am facing the flashing folder when turning it on. I have tried holding command &amp; c and etc but nothing happens when I hold option after hearing the chime the arrow come up and i don't see no folder but it stays like this. I do not own any disks to put into my macbook because it was given to me. i do not want to take it to the shop because it will cost more than the laptop it self will cost. Is there any type of way to resolve this issue?  <answer197446> The folder with question mark on start up means that the Mac is unable to locate your boot drive.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7fSYL.jpg" alt="OS X boot with question mark"  Many possible causes:  ol liCorrupted boot disk.  ul liYou can try Disk Utility using a boot via external unit (CD-ROM, external HDD, USB) to repair the disk. If you are unable to see the primary disk via Disk Utility follow the two possibility below./li /ul/li liHDD broken.  ul liReplace your HDD and install a fresh copy of OS X or try to extract your data form the broken HDD and move it to the new one./li /ul/li liHDD SATA cable disconnected / broken.  ul liYour HDD is connected via SATA flat cable. Open your Mac, check this cable if it is disconnected or try to replace it./li /ul/li /ol  <comment236021> You need a disk to boot off and given what is happening a new hard disk as well <comment236177> Can you say more clearly what the main issue is?
