Mavericks installation stuck at 18 minutes mark <body> I am trying to reinstall Mavericks an 27 inch, Mid-2011 iMacimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GIOQX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The hardisk has been reformatted, and I have created one partition Mac-HDD in it.  I have created a Mavericks usb installer using this command:  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia \ --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app --nointeraction /code/pre  Can you suggest anything I can try?  <answer123898> You can strongshow the install log by pressing cmd-L/strong. Make sure you're showing all messages and look at the bottom of the log. This may give you a hint as to what's happened (or happening).  <answer123934> You might also want to repartition the HD and then do a repair. It is possible you have some bad blocks on the HD and it needs to be replaced.  You could also do a secure wipe and do a one pass wipe with zeros, under security options. If that stops partway through I would blame the drive.  <comment144766> I have tried cmd-L but it does not respond. Nothing happened. Likewise there is reaction when I clicked 'About OSX installer' etc <comment144768> @Anthony It's probably crashed thenâ€¦ You will probably need to interrupt the install and try again, but with the installer log open.
