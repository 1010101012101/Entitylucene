switching spaces causes finder to crash/restart <body> I'm using Spaces on Mac OS X 10.6.7. Recently, several times a day, when I switch spaces using a hot-key (Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2, etc.), the Finder application crashes and restarts. That's moderately annoying, as all of my minimized apps restart, but even more annoying some apps lose their windows entirely and have to be shutdown and restarted.  Google has been unhelpful in identifying the problem. What might be going on, and how can I track down the error?  <comment15991> Is there any errors in your Logs? To check open Console application, click show all logs, then all messages on the left. Anything from finder? <comment17361> By Ctrl do you mean Command? As in âŒ˜ ? <comment17475> I meant "control", not command. In any case, the problem was resolved with a system upgrade and reboot... <comment143872> It could've been a corrupt plist file; in case something similar happens again.
