What's a good graphical SFTP utility for OS X? <body> I need a small graphical utility, using which I can ssh to a server and see all the files and copy and paste (drag and drop) into my local machine.  I am running Snow Leopard.  <answer25666> h2Transmit/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W4lTJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Panic's Transmit tops my list. An extremely well built and executed FTP Client that fully supports sFTP. Priced at strong$34./strong     Transmit is an excellent FTP (file transfer protocol), SFTP, S3   (Amazon.com file hosting) and iDisk/WebDAV client that allows you to   upload, download, and delete files over the internet. With the most   Mac-like interface available, Transmit makes FTP as simple, fun, and   easy as it can possibly be.   h2Forklift/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yrwhl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Forklift 2 is another terrific client that is just as solid and just as well built. Priced at strong$29.95/strong.     ForkLift will connect to any remote server FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3,   WebDAV, the SMB, NIS and AFP shares on your local network, or your   Bluetooth mobile phone- pretty much anything you can plug into or hook   up to a Mac. ForkLift also carries a complete toolbox for managing   your files, including Folder Synchronization, Batch Renaming, Archive   handling, Application deleter, editing files over remote connections   and many more. All these power features are packaged into a   Finder-like, dual-pane interface that delivers superior workflow while   remaining absolutely familiar to use, along with QuickLook, Spotlight   search and all.   h2Cyberduck/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7PMZl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Lastly, Cyberduck rounds out the list. It is not as well polished, but it sturdy and does the job. It is free.     Cyberduck is a robust FTP/FTP-TLS/SFTP browser for the Mac whose lack   of visual clutter and cleverly intuitive features make it easy to use.   Support for external editors and system technologies such as   Spotlight, Bonjour, Keychain and AppleScript are built-in.   There are others to be sure, but these are the one's I've used and personally recommend. Additionally, you may want to hit up places like MacUpdate, VersionTracker, or iUseThis for these types of questions. You will find much more diversity and get a better understanding of the programs available to you.  <answer25667> h1Cyberduck (Free)/h1  A great free FTP client. This is my go-to application. Anytime I need FTP access, I use Cyberduck. It's not quite as lightweight as Fugu, but it adds a lot more functionality than Fugu. I also really like the Growl integration with Cyberduck.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uhcw.png" alt="Cyberduck"  h1Fugu (Free)/h1  Awesome little FTP client. As I noted above, this is a lightweight FTP client. It is great for simple FTP transfers and browsing. I do like the dual panel navigation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLtQh.png" alt="Fugu"  EDIT: I forgot to add these.  h1Filezilla (Free)/h1  I haven't actually used Filezilla extensively, but from what I've seen of it, I really like it. I downloaded it and played with it for a bit and I really like the tabbed connections. I also like the ability to jump to a path easily.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xz1Nr.png" alt="Filezilla"  h1RBrowser (Free, $29 Upgrade)/h1  A free FTP/FTP-SSL client. I don't usually use RBrowser because a $29 upgrade is necessary to unlock other protocols (Local, FTP/SSL/TLS, SFTP-SSH). I do like the Site Manager. It's a handy little thing to have.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pt9Of.png" alt="RBrowser Site Manager" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8wcv.png" alt="RBrowser Browser"  I searched and came up with some other free FTP clients:  h1FireFTP (Free) - Firefox extension/h1  The one downside I see is that this is for Firefox. The website doesn't make it clear how it works with Firefox, so I assume it is an extension.  h1Macfusion (Free)/h1  This one relies on Google's MacFUSE. Since I don't know anything about MacFUSE, I don't know if this is good or bad.  h1Transmit ($34) By Panic/h1  I have never used Transmit before, but I have used Coda and I definitely would recommend anything from Panic. The only reason I haven't used this because of the $34 price tag.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/okNTF.png" alt="Transmit by Panic"  h1ForkLift2 ($30)/h1  Never used it, just found it when searching.  h1Fetch ($24 per user)/h1  An amazing program with a long, long, long mac heritage. It's way up there with Transmit by Panic and Interarchy as a file transfer program loved by long time Mac power users.  h1Flow ($30)/h1  Never used it, but looks good from the screenshots. I really like the fact that it looks like Finder. I may have to give this one a try.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9dCy.png" alt="Flow"  h1OneButton FTP (Free)/h1  Just searching around and found yet another one...It looks pretty nice, except it's no longer supported. However, you can still download it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RtAZ3.jpg" alt="OneButton FTP"  <answer25685> Add to others  h1RBrowser/h1  This provides more of an interface like Finder than the others (stricyly much more like the original NeXT version) Apart form standard ssh/ftp it will syncronise directories etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1wwru.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer25687> CaptainFTP is the best choice  Easy to download from itunes:  http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/captain-ftp/id416544161?mt=12  <answer25688> h2FileZilla/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5F7ZN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have tried Cyberduck and Flow in the past but Filezilla offers a side-by-side interface which is quite useful. The only limitation with this tool is that it's not really MacOSX-aware, e.g. it shows all hidden files   <answer25867> h1ExpanDrive/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u5xYK.png" alt="ExpanDrive"  ExpanDrive acts just like a USB drive plugged into your computer. Open, edit, and save files to remote computers from within your favorite programs—even when they are on a server half a world away. ExpanDrive enhances every single application on your computer by transparently connecting it to remote data.  <answer26548> Most other answers gave an objective analysis, but I'll share my experience.  Top clients:  ul liFlow: really nice interface./li liTransmit: very fast, can mount as Finder volume./li liCyberduck: the best for the inexistent buck./li /ul  <answer103681> Yummy FTP (commercial) : http://www.yummysoftware.com/  Can't believe the one that blows most of the above out of the water hasn't yet been mentioned.  <answer104473> If you need graphical utility with support for SSH you may try CRAX. This software has a built-in SSH client and after connection to the SSH server it's possible to invoke file operations like copy, move, and delete.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xPZp5.png" alt="CRAX Screenshot"  <answer184807> A more recent option is to use the newer implementation of Fuse for OSX in combination with SSHFS. This is a better solution because most of the applications mentioned are either outdated or payed (and expensive).   Fuse for OSX allows you to use new file systems in user space and SSHFS configures the system to allow you to connect to SSH drives automatically, as if they were drives supported by OSX.   <comment29112> Just a note since you mentioned you're new to Mac (I'm basically the opposite): Using copy/paste to work with files seems to be a very PC thing. Drag and drop, like you mentioned, is the "Mac way," and you can use modifier keys to force a drag and drop to a duplicate/copy (option), move (command) or make alias (command+option). The default behavior changes based on if you are moving between two different volumes, and is always shown as a badge next to your cursor during the drag. <comment29113> +1 for Transmit. I've used it for 7 or 8 years, and it's never disappointed me (that I can remember) <comment29119> I used Cyberduck for many years (couldn't see paying for an FTP client), then tried to use it to transfer several hundred files at once. It completely choked. Transmit handled the job with ease. <comment29134> In the title you say FTP, in the question you say SSH. I think you're looking for is an SFTP utility (FTP over SSH). Like many have answered, Cyberduck is a great free and open source tool for this. <comment29164> +1 for ForkLift... Doesn't get the attention it deserves. <comment29204> Flow is an utter failure. Hasn't been updated since August 2010, and has long had a history of being quite flakey. I used earlier builds and suffered more than enough crashers to stop using it. The one window pane is quite counterproductive too. At it's current price point, it can't even compete with Transmit and Forklift. <comment29220> Re MacFuse/MacFusion, it's good, but currently not working with OS X Lion. (this will also apply to [sshfs](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html)) <comment29221> Since you're on Snow Leopard, have a look at [MacFusion](http://macfusionapp.org/) - you can just mount an ssh/sftp connection like a network volume, simple. *(note: it's may work with Lion too, [see here](http://groups.google.com/group/macfuse/browse_thread/thread/f5d3442e19cfed14))* <comment29225> Transmit is well worth every bit of that thirty-four bucks. I'm also very selective about app purchases, and this is one that I can't do without. Definitely try it out — it's great. <comment29226> Transmit is definitely the Rolls-Royce of FTP Utils. I use it even when I'm not ftping for quick chmod's, browsing hidden directories, etc. It's almost perfect. <comment29249> You can drag and drop in Windows. You can cut/copy/paste on a Mac. Both options work on both platforms. Which you choose to do is purely a personal preference. <comment29258> +1 for Filezilla. I have used it on Win, OSX, and Linux for years. <comment29266> For-pay apps, Transmit is the de-facto-standard on OSX for FTP/SFTP. Do it. It's like a magical rainbow filled with unicorns, with a big pot of gold at the end. <comment29951> Totally regret ever paying for Flow. They removed SFTP (or anything but regular FTP) support since their 1.4 update about 6 months ago, and AFAIK still haven't gotten around to supporting it again. Also, when contacting the developer about how terrible an idea that was, he basically flipped me (paying customer) the finger and said I had to be patient or move along. Now a more than happy Transmit user... <comment29952> Transmit, $34 you will not regret. <comment30282> Please make this answer community wiki. <comment78908> According to the [blog](http://blog.fivedetails.com) Flow is no longer in active development as its dev has joined Facebook. <comment111766> Note that Cyberduck needs a Java runtime environment. <comment122945> Thanks for the answers on this. Be sure to read the [promotion section](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior) on [Help Center](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help) if you recommend the same software several times. <comment149172> This is a nicely done app for sure and I will probably be buying it. However, it seems that it does not perform some operations efficiently. I am on a slow network connecting to a foreign SFTP host. If I copy the contents of one foreign folder to another, it should just issue a copy command on the server. However it seems that it copies all data to my local computer, and then back up. It should be a very quick operation (1 or 2 seconds) but it is taking minutes instead. <comment184644> ExpanDrive mounts local volumes, not remote volumes. If you access an ExpanDrive mounted FTP volume from Path Finder, expect the owner/group to be those of your local machine and not those of your remote server. <comment186313> I like Filezilla. But there is one thing you should be aware of: passwords are stored in plain text in a configuration file. So anyone with access to your computer can easily read all your passwords stored within Filezilla. This is the main reason I am going with a different ftp-client now. Heres (one of) the thread(s) about this issue http://trac.filezilla-project.org/ticket/5530 . <comment219171> You van use Finder for read only sftp acces. Go-Connect to server: sftp://123.123.123.123 <comment219172> I wouldn't count a command line solution as a _graphical SFTP utility_. <comment220196> Cyberduck is 145mb!!! For s simple ftp client. Are they nuts? What did they use to write it? Javascript? <comment220197> Cyberduck is 145mb!!! Really? For a simple ftp client? :-/ <comment222958> "...as if they were drives supported by OSX." means you can see and use the remote machine in Finder. In MacPorts there is also a simple gui for mounting a remote machine, so you don't need the command line at all. This solution works perfectly with the ssh agent for password less logins too. <comment225329> The FileZilla installer from SourceForge now includes some spyware/adware. I encourage people to stay away from any solutions that use/rely on Sourceforge. <comment225331> The FileZilla installer from SourceForge now includes some spyware/adware. I encourage people to stay away from any solutions that use/rely on Sourceforge. A better link for FireFTP is probably https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireftp/ which gives more context about how FireFox extentions work. <comment226588> @greggles Okay, thank you for that update <comment305976> +1 for FileZilla. It does the work as expected, no issues. Free. <comment340540> FYI FileZilla can also handle pure SSH transfers, this is cool if you have to move files as lot on servers. <comment346674> Cyberduck is nice, and I've used it for a long time, but it's really slow and RAM-hungry under heavy load. Probably because it's Java. <comment348718> @sudo this is true. Also, this post was written 6 years ago. It's gotten considerably worse in that time. <comment365064> Cyberduck no longer appears to be free (but it is still "libre"/open-source).  It's now about $24 on the App Store. <comment365065> Fugu is power-PC only (it's kinda old at this point) and current versions of Mac OS X (eg: Sierra) do not support power-pc anymore, so it will not install.
