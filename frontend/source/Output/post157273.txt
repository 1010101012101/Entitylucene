Time Machine asks for a backup disk by the wrong name <body> I have a time machine backup drive that I have renamed to emHome Backup/em. Whenever I forget to take backups, OS X tells me "you haven't backed up to the drive emMy Passport/em for 10 days"  Running codetmutil destinationinfo/code I get this:  precodeName          : My Passport Kind          : Local Mount Point   : /Volumes/Home Backup ID            : XXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX /code/pre  I looked in the code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code file, but it doesn't contain the destination name.  How can I get the volume name and the time machine internal name to match again?  To be clear, this is more of an annoyance than a problem, the backups work flawlessly when I remember to give OS X the Home Backup disk when it asks for My Passport. :)  <answer157277> Right click the My Passport drive and go to Get Info and change the name in the "Name and Extension" section  <comment185018> The problem is there is no My Passport drive. I have only a backup drive called Home Backup.
