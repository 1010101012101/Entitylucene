Why is my iOS 6 device missing all iTunes Match playlists? <body> After upgrading to iOS I don't see any iCloud playing list in my iPhone.  The lists are OK in iTunes on my two OS X devices but not on the iPhone.  In the emMusic/em settings:  ul liemiTunes Match/em is switched on/li liemshow all music/em is also switched on/li /ul  Any hint?  <answer64757> Disabling and enabling emiTunes Match/em several times solved the problem.  <answer64774> I also found renaming the missing playlist in OS X caused it to appear back on a device that wasn't showing it.  <comment76853> Thanks for providing an answer, be sure to select it so that others can see it above the other alternate answers.
