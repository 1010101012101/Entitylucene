Is there good software for recovering photos from an iphone data <body> My iPhone is in recovery mode and I want to recover some photos. Does anyone know if dr.fone works? I don't want to pay for something that doesn't do the job.  <answer290456> Try iTools Pro (google it). It recovered my photos (but I only had 55 so I don't know if there is a maximum it will do for free).  Is your phone stuck in Recovery Mode?  <comment366637> Dr Fone will kick the iPhone out of Recovery Mode if that is all you need. <comment366641> It is stuck in recovery mode and gets error occurred (9) when I attempt to update the software in iTunes. <comment366642> Looks like iTools is a window program. I have a Mac. <comment366763> iTools has both a Windows and a Mac version. On http://sale.itools.cn/ you will find the Mac version of iTools (actually iTools Pro). The trial version will kick your iPhone out of Recovery Mode. So will Dr. Fone. <comment366799> Ultimately I decided that the phone was not repairable. And the programs I investigated would not recover photos without pay. Thanks for the suggestions
