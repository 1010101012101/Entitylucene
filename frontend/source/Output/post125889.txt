Where in the file system are iPhoto pictures located? <body> I have a friend who's hard drive died on their Mac Mini. I have removed the hard drive and placed it in external drive enclosure. I have a trick that may give me 5-10 good minutes with the drive before it spins it last spin, and I intend to use that time (if I can) to get a few files from the drive.   After talking with the friend, the most important data to them are photos that were stored in iPhotos in one of the profiles. Given that I will have at best only a few minutes with the drive, I want to know exactly where on the file system to look for this data.  <answer125892> h1iPhoto Photos Location/h1  iPhoto stores photos and meta-data in the user's home folder:  strong~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/strong  Within this folder, the original photos are stored at:  strong~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/Masters/strong  h2Bulk Copy with rsync/h2  If the user name was codefriend/code, the codersync/code command to copy all the original photos to the local desktop would be:  codersync -ra '/Volumes/MacMini/Users/friend/Pictures/iPhoto Library/Masters' ~/Desktop/code  <comment147538> Thanks. This definitely would have worked. Sadly, I was only able to buy about 20s of time with the drive... barely long enough to even recognize it's plugged in. No data this time :(
