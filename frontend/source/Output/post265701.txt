Dell external monitor has blurry font <body> I have a Dell S2316H monitor which I connect to my MacBook Pro (early 2015) using the built in HDMI port. The fonts are looking very blurry on the external monitor.  I own the MacBook for about a week. Previously I used my monitor with my Dell laptop which had Ubuntu installed on it. When I plug the monitor with my Ubuntu machine, the fonts are smooth and looks good. But when I plug it with the MacBook, the fonts are very blurry.  I know this is a common issue but I'm unable to find a solution. I do not have any DVI port on my monitor so I can't use the solution from External display has blurry fonts on Dell U2312hm- MacBook Pro Retina. Also tried this script  Force RGB mode in Mac OS X to fix the picture quality of an external monitor, but no changes. I tried with different font smoothing level too. Is there really any solution for this problem?  <comment333183> Have you tried different resolutions on the monitor? It could look better on a different resolution <comment333312> @NoahL I have tried different resolution, it's a full HD monitor, other resolutions doesn't looks well.
