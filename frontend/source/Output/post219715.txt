OS X Wifi Status Prior to Login <body> On the MacBook Air computers in my classroom there is a wifi status indicator that is visible prior to login (and which shows a strong signal), but in the user name box we get a warning that "network accounts are not available" and new users are not able to log in.  Is there a way to see network details (the equivalent of Option-click on the wifi status indicator) prior to login? The machines are running 10.10 (Yosemite).
