Uninstalling Java 6 to replace with Java 8 <body> Every single time I try to install the Oracle Java Runtime Environment... I keep being stuck with Apple's Java 6. I have no idea how Apple's Java 6 ended up on my computer in the first place.   I keep putting "java -version" into the terminal and it comes out telling me I'm still running 6...  How do I remove Java 6? All I want to do is manage to run a Minecraft server, but it demands Java 8.  (I'm running Mac OS X Yosemite, in case that is relevant, because I can't find any up-to-date tutorials on how to do this)   Thanks in advance.  <answer192193> Try installing Java Development Kit (JDK). I did and Terminal showed RE was using Java 8.  I had to do the same thing with Java 7 as well.  <answer192200> If you want to remove Java 6... From How to properly uninstall Java 6 on OSX?, do the following:     Remove the "system" JVM installed and maintained by Software Update  precode% sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk /code/pre      Remove any Java Developer Previews  precode% sudo rm -rf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0*.jdk /code/pre      Do NOT remove any content in the JavaVM.framework. Those items are   required by Java 7, 8, 9+ as well as Java SE 6. No modern version of   OS X has a Java JDK inside there anyway.   Then to have Java 8 run from the Terminal when using codejava -version/code you need to install the JDK not JRE.  Note: I've tested the instructions here under OS X 10,10.3 and it works however maybe you had installed Java 6 for use by some application that needed it, as an example I installed Apples Java 6 to run muCommander however it will run under Java 8 too.   <comment228540> Hi @Chris, welcome to Ask Different!.
