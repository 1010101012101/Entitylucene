How to make tap click faster? <body> The response of simple tap click on track pad is incredibly slow (like 1 s), (meanwhile usual click seems to be faster).  Same for "right button"-click - tap with two fingers. How can I speed up the tapping response?  <answer93015> h1No./h1  Unfortunately, the tap-to-click functionality on both MacBook trackpads and Magic trackpads can not be adjusted at the present - that might change in a future release (hopefully?).   h2Here's why:/h2  When tap-to-click functionality is enabled, there are two things it is watching for:  ul liA single tap (single click)/li liA double tap (double click)/li /ul  When a single tap is detected, the system doesn't know if you are intending to just make a single click or tap emagain/em for a double click - hence the 'delay' experienced.  <answer277597> Try this. Go to strongSystem Preference  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  Trackpad Options/strong and disable dragging  <comment109089> What device does your question relate to? <comment109090> Track pad. Sorry. <comment109094> You mean Apple's Magic Trackpad (http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/)? Do you have this issue regularly or it just happened now? <comment109107> jaume, Not exactly, I have macbook. Same with remote magic trackpad and iMac. I guess regularly, before I did try to play games and this wasn't a problem. <comment109146> Yes. But thereis no double tap with 2 fingers. And I have increased the speed of double tap - it changes nothing. <comment109147> One more - double click exist for a usual mouse as well :) a usual mouse doesn't has such a problem. <comment109148> @klm You can double-click faster with a 'usual' mouse
