OS X El Capitan partial download issue? (125kb file) <body> I am having trouble downloading El Capitan.   ol liI go to the app store and click download button for El Capitan./li liPinwheel spins for 5-10 sec then "download" button turns to "downloading" (this doesnt go away unless computer is restarted)/li liFile appears in applications folder as "OS X El Capitan" with only 125kb downloaded.  File won't open when double clicked./li /ol  I've tried the following... - check storage, i have 86 GB free  ul lichecked for unfinished downloads/li licleared download folder in app store debug mode/li lideleted 125KB file and restarted /li lirestarted in safe mode/li liran disk utility (no errors found)/li /ul  None of these have worked...  has anyone experienced this, know what's happening, or have any tips for next steps?  Internet board thus far have been dead ends.

I would suggest leaving the update running overnight, that should fix it.  <comment301222> trying this now... will report beck in the morning ;) <comment301225> @dudemcgregor Good night :) <comment301266> leaving the update over night didn't quite do the trick... the file in the applications folder still shows on 125kb downloaded.  Also find itI weird that i never see a status bar when downloading.
