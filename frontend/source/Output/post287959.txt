Two apps installed after recovery install of macOS <body> Recently I reinstalled a MacBook Pro 10.1.br I used Apple's (internet) recovery mode for this (the kbdcmd+alt+r/kbd command).br After successfully taking this process &amp;&amp; updating the OS to it's latest version, I rebooted the system.  Since then I took notice that there were two apps installed (under the right click menu of Finder). These apps have the name: "Tembo" and "Kaleidoscope".br Seeing that i did not install these apps by myself, and think this wasn't Apple's choice either - I found this worrying if not to understand!  Questions:br is it nowadays normal for macOS to have these (pre-installed trail?) software packages installed by default? Can I check something to figure out on the reason of why this is happening?br Looking at this myself I think my system has been compromised or something...  Weirdest weirder thing even,br after a few days using my MacBook, both these two apps just liked to disappear from the right click feature of Finder!!br I checked whether these apps actually were installed under the /Applications folder, and no they were not (yeah, really, i am not yoking you).  I also noticed an update for a "free dvd ripper" app in the App Store, which i had installed only before reinstallation. Again, the app was not to be found in the /Applications folder and disappeard out of itself too from update list in App Store...  No one has to tell me this thing i have is weird happening, but can someone tell me how this can actually happen, tell how to possibly fix this or in which corner I should seek this?br Is my ssd disk getting damaged for eg?  PS. Nobody had physical access to my laptop.
