itunes 12 renaming song database <body> I have a Nas with my iTunes library, code/Volumes/music/code is my codeitunes media/codefolder. I created one playlist and today I have something strange for some songs   precode+------------+-----------------+------------------+  |name        | artist          |album             |  +-------------------------------------------------+  |a movie name|                 |an album name     |  |from Video* |                 |from music        |  +------------+-----------------+------------------+  /code/pre  ul livideo is a volume on my nas…/li /ul   + i (information) for this song  name : Dragon II (2013), artist : empty, album : Mozart greatest hit   Another mistake (red line is for /.../.../....nfo) : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1fT1p.png" alt="information"  hr  h2In finder all is OK ("18 messe pour...") !/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xAcTT.png" alt="finder"  how to fix this ?  <comment204792> The path to location is wrong… /volumes/video/… so iTunes can't play/find - I never put this file in this volume… <comment204793> Does the solution in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/60330/itunes-can-not-find-music-anymore-after-changing-ip-address-of-nas?rq=1 help? <comment204800> No… I can delete and import file but I had the same problem few days after. <comment204810> Might be the NAS interacting with the way iTunes manages its library. Can you add a screenshot showing the right-most part of the preferences dialog (where "iTunes Media" location is defined)? Also, is `/Volumes/video` a valid path/mount point at all? And if yes, is it pointing to the same NAS? <comment204900> This is on the same nas and it's pointing to an existing file (dot nfo). I don't understand how itunes can go to this folder. <comment204954> Where does "iTunes Media" in iTunes preferences point to? <comment204970> It was `/Volumes/music`, now it's `/Volumes/music/Music`… <comment205999> ITunes 12 is a bad version… or it's my computer. Song information are changing, now I have bad meta "album artist" for a song is from another song.
