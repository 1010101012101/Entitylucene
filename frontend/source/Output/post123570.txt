Create a Bootable Windows USB from a OS X to work on a PC <body> What I need to achieve is  ol liCreate a Bootable USB drive from codeWindows 7 iso/code image using a Mac running./li liUse the flash drive to boot and install windows on a PC (not Mac)/li /ol  What I'm looking for is an app like WinToFlash but one that can run from OS X. This app make a bootable flash drive from a Windows iso image. I found a mac alternative to WinToFlash a while ago, but I don't remember the name.  All I can find is questions about making a bootable usb from a mac to a mac. I want to repair a Windows PC that doesn't startup but I have a working Mac computer, the target computer is a PC (not Apple).  A PC can't boot from a USB created with bootcamp which have MBR based BIOS.  UNetbootin doesn't seems to work with Windows iso's just Linux iso's.  P.S. the target PC have BIOS, it doesn't have UEFI.  <answer123692> Have you tried using UNetbootin with the Windows ISO? According to various references online it emshould/em work (although that was using the Linux and Windows versions).  Several years ago I created a Windows 7 boot USB using UNetbootin but I can't remember if it was created using OS X or a Windows virtual machine.  <answer123876> Bootcamp strongcan/strong create a USB for PC. Just only check the "Create a Windows 7 or later version install disk"  checkbox. A similar question from How to create a Windows 7 installation USB from OS X? shows that Bootcamp has the "ability to create install USBs" for Windows.  <answer167901> Please use following link, I have successfully created bootable usb for windows from mac.      http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx  <answer174467> I found a complete solution which helps solving many issues until you are able to create your bootable usb drive:  http://michael.anastasiou.me/create-windows-7-8-bootable-usb-drive-mac/  <comment145027> I tried, but the created drive doesn't boot. <comment145028> Accordingly to this, it doesn't work http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/75817/will-bootable-usb-created-by-bootcamp-on-mac-work-with-pc or at least isn't straightforward <comment145029> I ended using a friend's windows computer to user WinToFlash which worked just fine. <comment196891> Welcome to Ask Different! While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment205442> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment222765> there is no such option on tosemite <comment223442> It can but only till windows 7 <comment223443> I tried and it only add a few small files to the usb <comment236053> Just noticed that this does NOT work for x86 ISOs. The Bootcamp wizard detects the bitness and kicks it out as that won't run on your Mac. (Why am I using x86? Older laptop, and the hardware requirements for it are slightly lower.) <comment248896> What in that link helps Windows? Isn't there more to the story? <comment252521> this is a great solution, just use your windows iso, and do the steps. Basically: convert iso to img, unmount usb, use dd to put image on usb. Very simple, all easy command-line stuff. <comment256567> Perhaps I did something wrong: the files are on the USB stick but it's not bootable. <comment260057> Worked fine with the Windows 10 iso. <comment269254> @hithwen: Not sure why this wouldn't work for win8 and win10. This worked perfectly for me to create a bootable USB drive for Windows 10 (x64) using the latest ISO. (I'm running El Capitan, the USB key boots on a normal PC) <comment284166> I don't understand why this answer has so many down votes. The guide linked has helped me before to create a bootable Windows USB and it helped me now too. <comment328393> this does not work. <comment334505> Download and use 'Etcher' ... so simple. https://etcher.io/ <comment342785> This answer is no longer valid. I assume the instructions on the site you link to have been modified. This has nothing to do with dd any more , as commented by @konsumer <comment343289> Oh yeh, the instructions changed. Boo!  From here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/73183/copying-iso-file-to-usb-drive-in-os-x  First run diskutil list then insert your usb stick and run diskutil list again to see the disk node (e.g. /dev/disk2). Now run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN and do sudo dd if=/path-to.iso of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m When finished diskutil eject /dev/diskN <comment372404> Bootcamp on macOS Sierra tells me that I need to have at least 50 GB of free space on my disk: I can't see the simple option to create a bootable USB. Can Bootcamp still be used for creating a bootable Windows USB?
