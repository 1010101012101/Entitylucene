List failed login attempts on Mavericks <body> I want to see if somebody has tried to log in on my computer, which is running Mavericks. I am primarily interested in tracking ssh log in attempts, as well as tracking people physically typing passwords on my keyboard to try to log in.  strongRelated/strong  I have seen How to log login and logout on Mavericks?, but codelast/code seems to list only successful logins, or at least it mostly shows successful logins.  I have also seen an answer about looking in system.log or "all messages", using the console utility, but those files/messages seem very cluttered.

What does "log in" mean and are you looking for any solution or just one that is scriptable from a shell? <comment140704> @bmike I do not know what a screen sharing log in is. I am interested in the first two options, shh and local console. A while back my account on a friends server was hacked, as the credentials we made up were silly and we had enabled ssh. Fortunately no damage was dealt. I was wondering if such attacks could be found in a log, but I am also interested in people physically typing passwords on my keyboard to try to log in. <comment140707> +1. Unfortunately system.log only contains only entries from Feb 11. <comment140708> Excellent refinement on the question. I've been meaning to ask how to set up a ssh trigger to prevent repeated log in attempts. The answers here might give me some ideas on how to implement that sort of automated protection. <comment140709> Something like `zgrep "whatever" /path/to/system.log*` with some processing would check all compressed logs that remain on the system. I wonder if there's a way to call the apple system logger to get a more flat view of multiple log file's worth contents. <comment260789> All on Yosemite: `BAD SU` and `incorrect password` are keywords to search for for failed attempts to authenticate by `su` and `sudo` respectively. Ssh generates `authentication error for` in this same log file. I was not able to generate a message containing `Failed to authenticate`.
