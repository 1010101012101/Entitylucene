How do I clear All OS X notifications with 1 click? <body> I have notifications in the OSX Notification Center, as for most of my apps I am using the setting, "Show in Notification Centre: 10 Recent Items" This is a good setting but rather than have a very full Notification Center, I would still like to clear it from time to time with 1 click.  I am using Yosemite 10.10.3  <answer184679> I don't know a way to clear every notification with a single button, however you can clear all of one app's notifications by moving your mouse to the right of the app's header and clicking the small x button that appears there.  To clear them all, I simply move the mouse to the topmost app's x button and rapidly click which removes all of the notifications relatively quickly.  <answer234093> The small X in El Capitan is in the notification window. Open the Notification pane by sliding in from the right on the mouse or clicking on the notification center icon in the upper left corner. Each application's notifications are grouped together and there is a little X on the right side of each application's header. Click that X and the notifications all go away.  <answer241791> Another option, which uses Keyboard Maestro to run an Applescript is detailed here: http://genuinecuriosity.com/unnotify  I have it mapped so that I hit kbdCommand/kbd kbdOption/kbd kbd0/kbd to clear all open alert dialogs.  Basically, I have created an Applescript to click the first button on all open alerts (typically Close), and does that until all alerts are cleared. You can use the Applescript directly through Keyboard Maestro (as described in my article), or you can create a Service with Automator (this is a little more finicky due to Accessibility permissions requirements).  The full Applescript is included in the article, along with a screen grab showing the setup in Keyboard Maestro.  <answer276297> This SIMBL app does the trick nicely.  chuckhendo/NotificationClear: SIMBL bundle to add a "Clear All" button to Notification (https://github.com/chuckhendo/NotificationClear)  Just install it using mySIMBL.  w0lfschild/mySIMBL: SIMBL plugin manager for macOS (https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL)  Once installed, you can just open the notification center, then click "Clear" on the bottom.   <comment219075> thanks, that is what I do. Clicking the small x at the top of each notification section for 20 apps, is definitely not fast in my book. Not sure why you popped reply as an answer. <comment219085> @sea Haven't got comments yet <comment258394> I don't see any "small x" on El Capitan 10.11.1 <comment286163> You can close by day, if you hover over the day header line. <comment297147> It's helpful if you briefly summarize the linked reference as links can go stale in the future.
