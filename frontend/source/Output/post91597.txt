Drag email from mail.app to create a shortcut, not eml <body> Title is self-explaining. Once I succeeded, and there was .inetloc file including xml  code&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;URL&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;message:%3CCAODRpat8f6Ca07rDHa+-uq23Cp1nk5E9MEReXbX8YaXfMcu8BA@mail.gmail.com%3E&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt;/code  but now I cant recall how I did that.

The proxy icon is the envelope icon in the window's title bar, to the left of the message title./li /ol  Mail.app message proxy icon http://f.cl.ly/items/1a3g1u3Q2Q0H2h0n302o/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-05%20at%2000.56.06.png  <comment112484> thank you! already found that, but didn't posted, my bad.
