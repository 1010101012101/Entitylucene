Chmod add multiple groups <body> I have this command:  precodechmod -R +a 'group:test1 allow  list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit' /PATH /code/pre  Which works fine. Question is, how do I add another group in the same command?  This does not work:  precodechmod -R +a 'group:test1,group:test2 allow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit' /PATH /code/pre  <answer253941> You can't. codechmod +a/code adds emone/em entry to the ACL, and each ACL entry refers to one user or group. From the man page:     Each file has one ACL, containing an ordered list of entries. Each entry refers to a user or group, and grants or denies a set of permissions.    So you'll need something like  precodefor g in test1 test2; do     chmod -R +a "group:$g allow ... " /path/to/directory done /code/pre  <comment316096> Yes, that will work fine. Thank you sir!
