How to refer to the bottom in Pages <body> I'm writing a document in Pages, but I want to create a footnote at the bottom of the page. Something like in this image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yYdDI.png" alt="example"  How can I do this in Pages?  Thanks in advance  <answer129973> You can insert a footnote by going to strongInsert/strong â†’ strongFootnote/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsmOT.png" width="518"  <comment152188> I think you are describing a *footnote*, for your information.
