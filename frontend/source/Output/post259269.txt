macOS Sierra slow in calculating on the Storage tab <body> After upgrading to macOS Sierra I find that if I do, Apple  About This Mac  Storage, it just remains stuck on the "Calculating..." for a very long time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mvvGN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am pretty sure that this was not the case with OS X El Capitan.  Does anyone else also see the same issue?  <answer278531> All you have to do is leave the storage window open for a long time, say ten minutes. I am running 10.12.4.  <comment324326> How long is a very long time? <comment324367> Mine did this also but the 'Calculating...' message only lasted about 2 minutes, then it displayed the storage correctly.  Looking thru the Apple support site, this is a common issue.  Most people are just letting it finish the first time thru, then it seems to go faster during subsequent views.
