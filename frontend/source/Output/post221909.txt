Connecting a hardrive to an ipad for iMovie <body> Want to use my ipad for light movie editing computer. The 32 gigs is not cutting it. Is their a way to connect a hardrive to the ipad to use in imovie? I have in the past used icloud to store the bulk of the videos to edit on the ipad. This worked but i had to pay a few dollars a month, download the video files i wanted to splice and i could not work off line.   <answer221916> You can not use an external hard drive in combination with iMovie on any iPad.   If you are looking to expand your storage space you can look into a Seagate Wireless Plus hard drive, but you will have to store the video files locally in order to edit them with iMovie.  <comment268765> In short, no. You cannot expand any iDevice by hardware.
