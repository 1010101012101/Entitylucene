Transfer pictures via iCloud to new Mac <body> I had my Mac stolen last week. I now have a new one and would like all the photos I had backed up on iCloud on my new Mac. How do I do this?  <answer110596> If the photos were in strongPhoto Stream/strong, then you can go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongiCloud/strong, log in and check the box for strongPhotos/strong. Then, open iPhoto/Aperture and let it download the photos.  If the photos were added to iCloud by a specific app, go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongiCloud/strong, log in and check the box for strongDocuments &amp; Data/strong, then open the app that you used to back up the photos.  If the photos were manually backed up to the Mobile Documents folder, go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongiCloud/strong, log in and check the box for strongDocuments &amp; Data/strong, then wait for your files to sync.  <comment130252> How did you back up photos from a Mac into iCloud?
