When I connect to one of my hotspot, then every single Apple device will use that hotspot as a free wifi and possibly transfer large amount of data? <body> I have an iPad which I may connect to my hotspot. So I am very careful with this iPad: I make sure automatic app update / purchase, podcast, music are all disabled.  However, I found that when I connect my iPad to this hotspot, then every Apple device will also treat it as a "wifi" and connect to it (because they all have the same iCloud Apple ID). Even the iPhone 7 Plus I have, when it has 4G LTE itself, will connect to this "wifi", and potentially transfer large amount of data, thinking that "well, this is not expensive cellular data", so I will download that 1.2 GB apps update for you."  The other huge data usage could be "automatically download new podcast episodes", especially if it is video in HD.  How can this be avoided?
