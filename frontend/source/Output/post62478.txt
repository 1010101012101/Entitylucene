re-mount ejected SD card without reinserting <body> I use a microSD card in my macbook air for additional storage, using a flush adapter (homemade, similar to the nifty minidrive).  To save battery when I'm not using it, I disabled auto-mount using /etc/fstab.  But sometimes, I accidentally eject it instead of unmounting (because that's what the finder gui does).   After it's ejected, the only way I know to remount is to take the card adapter out and put it back in. Since it's flush, I need a paperclip to take it out.  So I need a way to re-enable the card reader without having to re-insert.  In Windows, this is possible using the devcon command-line tool from microsoft, or going to device manager, disabling and enabling the card reader.  There has to be a way to do this, so please don't answer just saying it's not possible.  Thanks  <answer62725> Type this in terminal:  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleStorageDrivers.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBCardReader.kext; sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleStorageDrivers.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBCardReader.kext /code/pre  This will unload and load the card reader kernel drivers, and it will appear in diskutil again.

This blog article tells you how to use Mountain to solve common issues with the Nifty MiniDrive like battery drain in sleep mode or how reattach the SD card after it has been ejected.  Best thing is Mountain installs a priviliged helper tool, so you don't have to enter your administrator password every time you want to remount the drive. Also you can configure Mountain to do it's job automatically in the background.  <answer212902> I am using TheMiniDrive with a microSD card (similar to the Nifty). Running Mavericks on a late 2012 13" MacBook with Retina and built-in SD Card Reader.  CoolkcaH's solution unloading/loading AppleUSBCardReader.kext didn't do anything in my tests.  However, Mark Aufflick's solution unloading/loading com.apple.driver.AppleSDXC did remount an ejected SD card, in one step, without having to go to Disk Utility. I used Automator, per PatrickT's solution, and simply replaced CoolkcaH's code with Mark Aufflick's. Here is the entire code that I used to replace Patrick's in Automator (again, make sure to replace [UserName] with your actual user name):  precodeon run {input, parameters}          display dialog "Your Administrator Password:" default answer "" with hidden answer         set PWD to text returned of the result          do shell script "sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleSDXC; sudo kextload -b com.apple.driver.AppleSDXC" user name "[UserName]" password PWD with administrator privileges      return input end run /code/pre  <comment72293> I appreciate this isn't what you want to hear, but unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to remount once you've ejected a disk (either through Finder, Disk Utility or using `diskutil`). As you say, if you unmount this disk (rather than eject) using `diskutil unmountDisk`, for example, then you can simply remount it again afterwards with `diskutil mountDisk`. That said, take a look at [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/40112/how-do-i-mount-ejected-external-usb-flash-storage) which suggests and alternative app and (in the comments) a way to do it using unloading kexts <comment72428> Thanks for the kernel module unload/reload idea, that makes perfect sense. I don't know why I didn't remember about that, it is equivalent to the Windows way. <comment175750> Great, thanks! I found this page to be very useful in setting up the script. Also, naturally, you much change the "your name" part of the code to your computer's name, otherwise your password will be rejected (I know, I was stupid enough to try).  http://daiya.mvps.org/applescript.htm <comment175752> I'd like to add the following free advice, based on my 1-day experience of having an SD card: Go to Spotlight Preferences and add the SD card to the list of things NOT to be indexed: indexing with an SD card seems to be buggy: it goes on in an infinite loop, it copies a million invisible files with extension _. (or something like that), it causes freezes to the cursor every 2 minutes, it drains the battery and, in my experience, heats up so much that the SD card is force-dismounted and you need to reset SMC to get it back. <comment176987> To prevent a mounted SD card from being indexed by Spotlight, I found the fourth method described in the comments at the bottom of this thread to "survive" unmounts (create a file named .metadata_never_index in the directory you want to exclude): http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/three-ways-to-prevent-spotlight-from-indexing-items-on-your-mac/ <comment192374> To clarify @PatrickT 's comment: "your name" should be your _user account_ name, not your computer's name (I know, I was stupid enough to try ;) ). <comment192376> @Gilead, spot on, thanks for correcting! I was stupid enough to set my computer's name and user account to the same name... <comment280928> Links can break. Please provide a clear answer to ensure the longevity/integrity of your answer for future viewers. <comment283736> Works perfectly in El Cap (10.11.4) with my Nifty drive. Very helpful when my laptop battery dies and it falls into hibernation mode, and I want to remount the drive after being plugged back in. (But without having to restart.)
