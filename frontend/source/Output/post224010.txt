Is there another way, other than ⌘H, to visually hide an app <body> I'm looking for an alternative method to visually hide an app, specifically, Skype.  Skype has really lousy configurations for how it works with Notification Center. Specifically, if the Skype window is hidden (⌘H), or minimized (⌘M), it will not deliver notifications to Notification Center. Only the red badge.  It will only deliver to Notification Center if the Skype window is on the desktop. Which, in my opinion, defeats the very purpose of notifications - to notify you of that which you're not looking at.  But I don't want to keep Skype's window on my desktop all day, I want to be notified of communications while keeping this junk software out of my sight. I don't want to be the slave, checking up on that app all day. I want it to notify me, in the usual way.  Is another way to reduce the visibility of an app, that would go unrecognized by Skype?  Or how can I better handle this situation?  <answer224253> Found a solution. Some apps have ⌘ shortcuts to toggle their various windows.  Skype uses ⌘1 for it's primary window. Looks like I can hide it via this method and continue to receive visual notifications. Great!  <comment271616> How about adding an additional Desktop and assign Skype to it and then swipe , or shortcut key, it out of the way. <comment271618> Not bad, thanks.
