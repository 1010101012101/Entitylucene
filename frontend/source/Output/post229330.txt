"Install additional required components" is keep returning in Xcode <body> So dialog codeInstall additional required components/code is reappear several times.  I didn't notice regular period of time when this question appear but it's keep reappear when I want to launch Xcode. Several times I did install this components but I'm starting to thinik that this isn't normal. I do have 4 plugins :  ul liSCXcodeEditorInset/li liVVDocumenter-Xcode/li liXcodeBoost/li liXcode_beginning_of_line/li /ul  I'm not sure what I should do to fix this. I'm using Xcode 7.2.1.
