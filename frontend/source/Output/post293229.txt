Why does my monitor, hooked up to MBP, show pixelated dark colors? <body> As the following image shows, my HP 27xi monitor, hooked up via HDMI to an early 2015 MBP, does weird things to dark colors/black. This happens to just about any YouTube video I watch in fullscreen. Does anyone know why? I realize it's not the best monitor but it should handle 1080p without a problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NI2p.png" alt="Example image"
