Wifi doesn't work: interface not powered <body> Since yesterday I don't see any wifi network after turning it on:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lqgxk.png" alt=""  That's the error I get from the console.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cz0d1.png" alt=""  Does it mean it is a hardware problem?  It's a Mavericks install (10.9.2), build 13C64 in a MBP 15-inch, Mid 2012.  <answer127233> Interestingly it does show Connected but the WiFi settings are wrong and the Network settings are wrong?  Anyway, lets bypass the GUI and use Terminal for some direct commands.  In Terminal type (to turn it on)  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on /code/pre  Next type (to scan)  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport scan /code/pre  Finally type (to connect)  precodenetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 WIFI_SSID_I_WANT_TO_JOIN WIFI_PASSWORD /code/pre  <comment149090> What it actually shows is your WiFi and Network settings are incorrect?
