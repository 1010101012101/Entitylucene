Bluetooth and WiFi interfering with one another since Yosemite <body> Note: The emonly/em thing that changed in my setup is installing Yosemite.  Since installing Yosemite, I'm having a somewhat peculiar problem: WiFi works fine, and BT works fine. But WiFi + BT working together at the same time is a different story.   I first noticed this yesterday. Two things happen, and the second is more prevalent:  ol liI was using Apple's Magic Mouse + wireless keyboard, and began downloading a large file. Once this happened, mouse movement began being really slow, as if I'm trying to move the mouse on a very uneven surface. Pausing the download would bring the mouse's movement back to normal./li liBut then something else started happening: Turning BT on would effectively kill my internet connection. From the moment I turn on BT and start using mouse &amp; keyboard, my download speed would go quickly from 1.3MB/s to 500B/s (yes, Bytes), and die slowly from there. When this happens, my mouse movement is just fine. Upon turning BT off, download speed shoots back up to 1.3MB/s./li /ol  So to me it seems like BT and WiFi are "competing" with each other, like they're sharing the "same lane" when they shouldn't. strongEither the normal WiFi speeds will make my mouse move really slowly, or, if my BT is working fine, then my WiFi download speeds will be abysmal/strong. This seems to only happen (or be noticeable) when I'm downloading something like a big file.  I've tried many solutions — PRAM, hardware tests, etc..nothing seems to have helped.  WTH?  strongNote:/strong This question isn't about the (seemingly more common) WiFi dropping issues, please don't hijack it.  strongUpdate 1:/strong There seem to be more people having this issue.  strongUpdate 2:/strong Problem persists even after updating to OS X 10.10.1.  strongUpdate 3:/strong Over 5 months later, and Apple still haven't fixed this.  strongUpdate 4: (29/10/15)/strong One year later (on the latest OS X El Capitan), and my rMBP is still suffering from this issue. Work perfectly on their own, but together they get very challenging. For those who suggested to just get a 5GHz router — I appreciate your responses. However, I don't think I should be obligated to buy a new router just because Apple messed up their software. This is no fix for the underlying issue that is clearly still there for many people. strongThe answer selected as "correct" was auto selected since this was a bounty quesiton/strong.  <answer162406> Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11/b/g/n (WIFI) use almost the same frequency bands:  ul liBluetooth: 2.402 - 2.480 GHz (79 channels)  /li liWIFI 2.4 GHz (IEEE 802.11/b/g/n): 2.4 – 2.4835 GHz (11, 13 or 14 channels depending on the country)/li /ul  Usually Bluetooth uses codefrequency hopping/code and changes the possible 79 x 1 MHz bands 1600 times a second to avoid disturbances while WIFI uses fixed channels.  Obviously something went wrong developing the latest Bluetooth- or WIFI-drivers.  The only workaround until Apple gets their drivers fixed is using dual band wireless access points. Those devices use two different frequency bands: 2.4 – 2.4835 GHz and 5.18 - 5.825 GHz (with some gaps). Connecting to WIFI 5 GHz (IEEE 802.11a/h/n) will not interfere with Bluetooth.  Almost all Macs sold since 2006 support 802.11 emstronga/strong/em/b/g/emstrongn/strong/em.  Apple's answer: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: Potential sources of wireless interference  BTW: Not only typical RF-based devices (like wireless phones, etc) but also bad-shielded USB3-devices and cables interfere with WIFI (2.4 GHz) and Bluetooth.  <answer201044> IMO - the true fix for this is to get your WiFi network off 2.4 GHz when it's not reliable.  I put together a bit of a guide on how to know if you have to spend the $$ to get a better frequency, and the tools/books are about $20 each.  ol liGet off 2.4 GHz - use 5 GHz as it's far less susceptible to interferance and channel overlap./li liIf you are on 2.4 - get a tool like WiFi Explorer to make sure you have a viable environment to have a reliable experience./li liIf you want to learn more and have limited time to piece things together from internet volunteers, this take control book by Glenn Fleishman is excellent./li /ol  See Yosemite keeps dropping WiFI connectivity for more details on how to diagnose an interference issue between BT and WiFi on 2.4 GHz  <answer205472> Most likely the introduction of Continuity in Yosemite increases the demand for wireless bandwidth and that impinges upon the already crowded 2.4GHz band shared between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Many pieces of evidence support this theory:  ol liBluetooth and Wi-Fi interference only came to the fore strongafter/strong the introduction of Yosemite so it can't be just due to the fact that they share the same frequency band (otherwise Mavericks would suffer from the same problem on a wide scale)./li liThe more Bluetooth devices that one has the more likely that one's Wi-Fi connection would deteriorate or even get dropped completely./li liThe presence of any Bluetooth device that requires a large bandwidth and constant connection, e.g. Bluetooth speakers, almost always incurs interference./li liRemoving Bluetooth PAN from one's network or terminating AirDrop service work for some (most likely those with very few Bluetooth devices) albeit for a short period of time suggests that congestion is a culprit./li liFinally, those who use routers with dual-band support, e.g. one from the latest AirPort lineup, don't seem to suffer from this problem./li /ol  I also suspect that people who suffer from this type of interference the most are those who have devices that can only support up to 802.11b/g on their network, e.g. a pre-2009 PC or Mac.  Despite the instability of discoveryd, Apple kept it for three updates before finally removing it on the fourth. Apple must've felt the need for a new network service that can both accommodate the augmented bandwidth requirement of Continuity and the security demand that it wants to meet.  Update: Restricting my Airport Express (1st gen) to 5 GHz has made the problem go away completely and my Wi-Fi speed has jumped an incredible three-fold.  <answer217835> While still not perfect, removing the Bluetooth PAN device (even if its not connected at all) from the network devices helped me greatly.  <comment180355> I'm experiencing the same problem on my late-2013 MacBook Pro.  I've been using a bluetooth keyboard/trackpad for a year with no issues, but after installing Yosemite my Wi-Fi performance is poor in general and my laptop will lose its connection to the Wi-Fi network entirely several times an hour. I have to turn Wi-Fi off and back on in order to reconnect my laptop to the network. <comment183434> @Patrick I have a similar setup (Wifi + Bluetooth Mouse) and a similar issue: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155799/why-yosemite-keeps-dropping-wifi-connection/ <comment189865> What happens if you change the wifi channel or frequency. I thing BT may be 2.4.. <comment189915> I notice you mentioned PRAM, but did you try the SMC reset? This fixed a bluetooth lag issue for me a few weeks ago: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 <comment189919> SMC is the only fixed published by apple <comment263676> I can confirm that the WiFi issue (drop from 50Mb/s to 2Mb/s as soon as I would turn magic mouse or keyboard on) completely disapeared as soon as I reconfigured my WiFi router from 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz (by simply choosing 5GHz in a dropdown list and confirming with Apply - nothing fancy is needed if your router supports that frequency). <comment275193> Nice analysis! 802.11b and Bluetooth have always used **the same bandwidth** (2.4 GHz, since their inception). ---- They are condemned to collide. **They can't coexist pacifically, no way**. <comment329696> Link seems to be broken. Can you update the answer with a link which works and maybe summarize the steps required directly in your answer? <comment329697> I removed the link. There was a device in network settings named like that.
