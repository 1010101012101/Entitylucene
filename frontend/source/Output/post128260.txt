Trackpad sometimes non-responsive when starting/waking MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch <body> A few weeks ago, my mid-2012 15-inch MBP retina's trackpad became unresponsive when I lifted the lid to wake it up. I restarted and the issue went away.  The issue has been getting more and more common, and now it's at the point where I have to restart the laptop up to half a dozen times for the trackpad to work.  A few noteworthy points:  ol liThe keyboard is fully functional and responsive at all times/li liThe trackpad never freezes while it's being used, only after sleep or restart/li liResetting the SMC doesn't always fix the freezing/li liRepairing disk permissions has done nothing/li liThe trackpad sometimes freezes at the startup disk selection menu if I go to it (by holding option at startup)/li liThe trackpad sometimes works in disk selection, but freezes when I load up OS X/li liA USB mouse will always work when plugged in, regardless of the state of the trackpad/li /ol  Does anybody know how I could go about diagnosing this issue? The fact that it's happening at the boot disk selection menu implies to me that the issue is caused by firmware or hardware rather than a buggy OS.  Thanks!

Haven't had any issues since.
