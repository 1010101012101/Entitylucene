Turn Wifi Off via command line <body> I'm sharing my internet in work and forgot to turn it off! Does anyone know how I can do it via the command line? I have SSH access but thats it. D'oh.   <answer10765> You could use this to turn it off:  precodesudo ifconfig en1 down /code/pre  And if you want to get it back up, just type strongup/strong, instead of strongdown/strong  Just make sure that en1 is the right interface or you can easily kill off your ssh access :)  P.S. As strongLri/strong noted in the comments below, you can quickly disable the correct network interface with just 1 line:  precodesudo ifconfig `networksetup -listallhardwareports | grep -E '(Wi-Fi|AirPort)' -A 1 | grep -o "en."` down /code/pre  This will detect the correct Airport/wireless device and will turn it off  <answer51463> Try   precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off /code/pre  <comment11307> possible duplicate of [Start/stop internet sharing from a script?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2488/start-stop-internet-sharing-from-a-script) <comment58821> Or `en0` on MacBook Airs. You can find out the device name with `networksetup -listallhardwareports | grep -E '(Wi-Fi|AirPort)' -A 1 | grep -o "en."`.
