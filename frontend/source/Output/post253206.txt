Why can't I shuffle songs within a specific album under the latest version of iTunes 12.5.1.21? <body> Prior to the update, I was able to select the "Shuffle Songs" button in the upper-mid Information Bar, click on a specific song in an album and then hear a mix of songs strongonly/strong from that album.  For example: If I clicked on a song from the album emL.A. Woman/em and I had shuffle enabled, I would only hear other songs from that album.  Under the current version, If I select a song from emL.A Woman/em, I will get that one song and then a mix of songs from my entire library.  In this example, the next song might be from emFrank Sinatra/em, the emDead Kennedys/em, or anything else.  strongHow do I disable this "feature?"/strong    strongI don't want to have to click "Shuffle Album" to hear the songs shuffled./strong   Often I will start with one song I want to hear, hear another song from the random shuffle on the album, and then select a new song to hear from the same album  <answer253207> Select Control  Shuffle In the drop down/slide out menu check 'Album' instead of 'Songs'
