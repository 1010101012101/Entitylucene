Dashcode (3.0.5) crashes in Mountain Lion (10.8.4) <body> I'm trying to get Dashcode to run in order to make a dashboard widget to surprise my friend. The app opens but crashes almost instantly (even in safe mode and Mavericks). The console yields the following errors:  precode6/23/2013 10:38:23.041 PM Dashcode[743]: *** WARNING: -[NSImage compositeToPoint:operation:] is deprecated in MacOSX 10.8 and later.

You then get an option to rebuild the library (there are four different radio buttons, start at the top - checking whether DashCode launches between each rebuild - if it doesn't work still try the next rebuild option in iPhoto)  <comment111109> The guide on [Ask] will help you refine your question by showing what you've tried and/or what exactly "you don't get". If you don't get a good answer, feel free to try editing in some details or links on what question you used and what step is failing or doesn't make sense. We love details here. <comment111191> That's really all there is to it. I open dash code, it locks up and requires a force quit. I've tried deleting it's temp files, and I've tried on both 10.8.4 and 10.9 DP 1. I showed the errors given, and beyond that, I can't think of any other details to replicate the problem. <comment118339> Wow lol that actually worked
