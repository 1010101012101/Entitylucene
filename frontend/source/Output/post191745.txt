Applescript variable not being passed <body> I have a basic applescript to request a user's input, then pass the variable into a path for mounting a volume:  precodedisplay dialog "What is the first letter of your last name?" default answer "" set LastNameInitial to text returned of result  mount volume "smb://ServerName/files/myfiles/LastNameInitial" /code/pre  However, when this is executed, it fails to mount the volume as it does not exist because it is trying to mount the literal path above and not using the variable. What am I doing wrong?  <answer195463> You need to just add the variable to the end of your predetermined path string, like this…  precodeset LastNameInitial to "" repeat while LastNameInitial is ""     display dialog "What is the first letter of your last name?" default answer ""     set LastNameInitial to text returned of result     if LastNameInitial is not "" then         mount volume "smb://ServerName/files/myfiles/" &amp; LastNameInitial     end if   end repeat /code/pre  I added a safety net just in case they don't enter an initial, which will keep springing the same dialog until they do, or cancel  <comment227795> untested… mount volume "smb://ServerName/files/myfiles/" & LastNameInitial <comment227802> That did it! Thanks for your help. <comment233344> Moving this to an answer just to keep things tidy...
