Detect mouse move or keystroke <body> Is it possible to make a program execute when the mouse is moved or any key is pressed?  <answer207010> You can do the opposite. You can check for inactivity.  So then it is just a matter of doing nothing as long as inactivity increases...  precode#!/bin/sh  # Pause/Interval between checks checkInt=5  # Keep track of the idle timer lastIdle=0  while true ; do    ioresp=`ioreg -w 0 -c IOHIDSystem | sed -e '/HIDIdleTime/ !{ d' -e 't' -e '}' -e 's/.* = //g' -e 'q'`    idleNow=`echo $(( ${ioresp} / 1000000000 ))`     re='^[0-9]+$'    if ! [[ $idleNow =~ $re ]] ; then       echo "error: ioreg did not return a number" &gt;&amp;2; exit 1    fi     echo "Idle now is $idleNow secs, was $lastIdle secs"     # if idle decreased then action occurred so we do something...    if [ $idleNow -lt $lastIdle ] ; then       osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to display dialog "Hello World"'       lastIdle=0    else       lastIdle=$idleNow    fi     sleep $checkInt done /code/pre  It is crude but may be it will do the job.... !?!  <comment249542> Do you mean a specific key is pressed or are you talking in general? <comment249567> @Vic: I mean any key.
