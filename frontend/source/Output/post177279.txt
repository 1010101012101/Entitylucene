How to remove iCloud account from used iPhone? <body> I bought an iPhone 4s used and the previous owner did not clear their iCloud account. I need to reset phone, but can't turn off "Find my Phone" because of iCloud password!  How can delete iCloud without a password?  <answer177282> Take it back to the shop. Only the original owner can disable it, or Apple, if you can prove ownership &amp; sale by its original owner [which is harder than you think].  See How can I bypass Activation Lock?  If you can contact the original owner, then point them to this Apple web page -br What to do before selling or giving away your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch  â€¦see about halfway down, how they can do it after they already sold the phone.br Once they have removed it from their iCloud account, it will unlock &amp; you can set up as a new device.  <comment209647> Thanks I bought it from a individual. They seem to be willing to work with me for now! I'm just impatient and want it resolved so I can get it activated for my husband. <comment209648> I've updated my answer with a link they should see
