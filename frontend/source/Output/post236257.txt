Disable Click to Exit Full Screen in Safari <body> I'm quite a new mac user and there is one thing that really bugs me with using Safari which watching videos in full screen mode. It does not happen in Chrome though.  I normally watch video tutorials in Safari in fullscreen and then do the CMD + TAB to switch to my application to try out what I have learnt. When I do that and go back to Safari, it says "Click to Exit Full Screen" which still playing under the now glossed out window. And then when I click it, the video is displayed again but in its normal mode, not in its full screen mode.   I just want to CMD + TAB back and forth from my full screen video to my application and back again. Is there a way to disable this "Click to Exit Full Screen" so that Safari will always play the videos on fullscreen even if I switch between windows while it is playing?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NQ32i.png" alt="enter image description here"
