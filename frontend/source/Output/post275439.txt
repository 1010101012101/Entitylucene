SIP won't stay disabled - I think <body> I wiped my SSD clean, reinstalled OS X El Capitan, removed corestoreage, and went on to remove SIP using codecsrutil disable/code in the codecommand+R/code recovery environment. (I also tried it from the installation medium) It says it was successful and that I should reboot. I do that and once logged in, I type codecsrutil status/code and get back;  precodeSystem Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration)  Configuration:   Apple Internal: disabled   Kext Signing: disabled   Filesystem Protections: disabled   Debugging Restrictions: disabled   Dtrace Restrictions: disabled   NVRAM Protections: disabled  This is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state. /code/pre  So, I reset the PRAM &amp; SMC several times, rebooted afterwards several times, and did it again (several times) and I still get the same message. So..... is it disabled or not? :)  The one, possibly, weird thing, was that I installed an update to the recovery system via the App Store. It also wanted me to install Sierra but I'm not sure I want that yet. Did this "newer" version of the recovery make it not possible to disable it? I remember a less confusing message the last time I did it - like 2 years ago or more.  Also, I ran codels -lO /usr/code and it said coderestricted/code.  My mac is a :  MBP retina 15" Mid 2014  Thanks much!  strongedit/strong  By the way, I did look at this:  Issue in disabling SIP (rootless) in El Capitan but running codels -lO /usr/code is what causes me to be concerned still....  <answer275440> The message you're getting confirms that you have SIP disabled as you can see that strongall/strong the individual items are emdisabled/em.  The reason you're getting this sort of emconfusing/em message is that you've just re-installed El Capitan. It's the message format that was used in El Capitan 10.11.0 and 10.11.1. Apple changed this with the release of El Capitan 10.11.2 so that the message was clearer.  <comment346514> what about the 'restricted' business in the ls command? I don't remember it being that way.... <comment346515> It's actually normal - it has to do with Apple's "Rootless" security system that was deployed on El Capitan. <comment346516> ok... well my install is old so maybe the 'restricted` disappeared on its own.. I'll try the newest el capitan 10.11.6 Thanks <comment346518> Yep, it became much more clear after updating to 10.11.6 (15G1217). 'Restricted' is still there but all seems well.
