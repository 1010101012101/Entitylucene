How can I remove a site from the reading list in Safari on my iPhone? <body> How do I edit the items in my "reading list" in Safari?  Unlike bookmarks, there doesn't seem to be an "edit" option.  <answer31350> To remove an item, just swipe your finger to left over that particular entry. A red "delete" button will pop up.   <answer48635> You need to swipe your finger to the left on the particular one you want to delete. A red Delete button will appear. Tap that button and you should be able to get rid of it.  <comment35940> You can swipe to the left or the right.  This trick will delete items from a list in many applications. <comment109672> Works perfectly as stated. Thank You. <comment359169> How does this improve over the answer given in the previous year?
