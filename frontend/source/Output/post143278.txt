Thumbnails for Image Files on Desktop won't load <body> I have a dozen or so image files on my iMac's desktop.  Most of the time, after booting up my computer, it displays a thumbnail of each image (as it should).  But sometimes, the thumbnails won't show up (see screenshot below).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2sU39.png" alt="Screenshot"  It appears to happen randomly.  I estimate that it happens about 20% of the time.  Why is this, and how can I prevent it from happening?  I am running OS X 10.9.4.  Thanks.  <answer143366> Based on your log, I suggest trashing the Finder property list, then rebooting.  ul liOpen Terminal/li liEnter the following command coderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code/li liRestart/li liIf the issue persists, I suggest following these instructions. to completely reset the service./li /ul  Further information: The X Lab's Maverick's Post Installation Issues  <answer188236> I just solved the same issue by going (in the Finder) to View-Show View Options. There, I moved the Icon Size slider to a larger size. All the image thumbnails loaded. Then I returned the slider to my selected size.  HTH!  <answer247434> This was happening to some of my image files as thumbnails on the Desktop. I simply went to Force Quit and relaunched Finder. Images all returned to these thumbnails. Hope this helps s.o.  <answer273828> ol liRight click: show view options/li liShow icon preview: yes/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4xaC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment168749> Open your [Console app](http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/checkconsole.html). In the upper right corner, enter a search for `com.apple.IconServicesAgent`. Update your post, or supply a [pastebin link](http://pastebin.com) in your reply with the 10 most recent entries, if applicable. <comment168815> @njboot Thanks, here are the search results I got back.  The problem occurred yesterday (8/26/14), but there don't seem to be any error messages for that day.  Also, the earliest log entry is only 3 days old, which seems strange.   http://pastebin.com/Wue07AH7 <comment168980> Thanks.  I've run the `rm` command.  If the problem does not surface in a week or so, then I will consider it fixed. :) <comment169175> Nope.  It happened again. :( The `rm` command didn't work.  I tried the longer set of instructions.  We'll see if that works. <comment169878> So, it seems to be working now.  Marking as answered.  Thanks again! :) <comment241854> What other settings will this erase? <comment305344> Welcome to Ask Different.  It's helpful if you explain how to "Force Quit" an application for the visitors who are not familiar with that procedure.
