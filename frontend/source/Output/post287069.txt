How to clean computer from recovery mode terminal? Stopped working after had about 33MB left <body> How to clean computer from recovery mode terminal? Stopped working after had about 33MB left. Now is loading until middle and stuck, then shut down automatically.  In recovery mode I have a terminal, through which I could clean trash bin to have space so it can load? I was doing CD from code//code to different folder but couldn’t find home folder with all documents so I dont know where to look.  Also in recovery mode in disk managment in both whole disk and partition of OSX was veryfying disk fine, but was trying to restore something and then stopped on partition drive error fixing.  <answer287085> Booted to Recovery Mode your boot volume is a mounted base macOS image residing in a subfolder of the recovery partition. It doesn't contain a /Users folder and if so it would be the wrong one. So cd to your main volume instead.  To check and modify your standard boot volume you have to get its volume name and device name first. Open Terminal in the menubar  Utilities:  precodemount #get volume names and disks diskutil list #get disk identifiers of internal disk and CoreStorage: usually disk0 and disk2 for CoreStorage Logical Volume diskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk0 diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk2 #CoreStorage diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk0s2 #no CoreStorage /code/pre  Try to repair any error by replacing the suffix emverify/em with emrepair/em.  Now cd to the volume (example name here: "Macintosh HD"):  precodecd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD pwd /code/pre  Now cd to the Users folder and your user folder:   precodecd Users ls -la cd username #with username: usually your short username /code/pre  Remove dispensable user files. Other places to remove files from are /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/private/tmp, /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/cores or /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/private/var/vm. Replace "Macintosh\ HD" with the name of your main volume here.  <comment362359> How big is your disk? Did you definitely download something or create file large enough to cause a situation like this? <comment362367> What is your objective here? Cleaning your drive so you can sell the Mac? Recovering an unbootable Mac? Removing a specific big file? <comment362423> it stopped working because he was out of space—it seems pretty clear that he simply wants to remove things so that he can boot the computer <comment362606> @JakeGould downloaded big file fast and at one point was messege some 30mb left after came to computer.. Maybe in end was even less- cant confirm since was late. Forgot to clean bin and shut it down. Later not starting. <comment362607> @patrix objective to continue using with all files hopefully working- couldnt find home and files from recovery mode.
