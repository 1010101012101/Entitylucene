Two different announcements from the same iPhone with the same iTunes connection <body> Last time I connected my iPhone to iTunes and I received two different announcements while restoring the iPhone:  strongfirst:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BhImf.png" alt="enter image description here"     Last archive: Today 21:53   strongsecond:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LrM36.png" alt="enter image description here"     Last archive:   Your iPhone has never been backed up to this computer.   Why it happens like that? The second one is not true...  <answer277639> After restoring your device iTunes will not link it to the previous backup. Your backup whatsoever nonetheless exists. You can find a list of your backups in iTunes Preferences  Devices / If you're using iTunes for Windows, choose Edit  Devices.   By what I understood your first screenshot is before restoring and your second screenshot is after restoring, therefore it makes sense.  Nothing to worry about. Doing a new backup will not delete your old one.  <comment349430> Agreed on all of this, except that doing a new backup usually does replace/update the old one. Since it looks like you're on a Mac, in that iTunes Preferences  Devices, right click on the old backup and select "Archive" if you want to ensure it stays around. <comment349433> Thanks, Kelly! What I said could be misunderstood! iTunes does indeed replace the previous backup of the same phone, it keeps backups of every other phone.
