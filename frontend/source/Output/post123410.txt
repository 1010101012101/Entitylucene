Homebrew / link osxfuse not possible <body> I didn't run codebrew doctor/code since a lot of time. Know it tell me I should run codebrew link/code osxfuse. Here I show you the rest:  codeNewton:~$ brew link --overwrite osxfuse Warning: Could not link osxfuse. Unlinking... Linking /usr/local/Cellar/osxfuse/2.6.2...  Error: Permission denied - /usr/local/include/osxfuse/fuse.h/code  When I run it with codesudo/code, it says it is better that I shouldn't do it. So I didn't try. Here is the permission.  codeNewton:~$ ls -l /usr/local/include/osxfuse/fuse.h -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  246 17 Dez  2011 /usr/local/include/osxfuse/fuse.h/code  What can I do?  <answer123931> It seems to work if you change the permissions of the parent directory /usr/local/include/osxfuse  You need to ensure that your user has write permissions to this directory and all of it's files.  This should work:  precodesudo chown USERNAME /usr/local/include/osxfuse sudo chgrp GROUPNAME /usr/local/include/osxfuse sudo chmod o+w /usr/local/include/osxfuse /code/pre  <answer169963> This question is only relevant to OSX versions before Yosemite. If you have Yosemite or a newer version of OSX, it is not possible to build the OSXFUSE formula from the source. Brew suggests that you install the binary offered by Homebrew Cask:  precodebrew install Caskroom/cask/osxfuse /code/pre  <comment144113> `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)` This code will install homebrew / R. <comment144166> Homebrew is definitly installed. <comment144798> How do the permissions need to be changed? <comment145008> Hopefully that change clarifies things. <comment155702> It works, but now truecrypt begins to strike. But if we can believe the latest news about truecrypt... <comment255656> and also `brew uninstall --force osxfuse` to remove older version of osxfuse
