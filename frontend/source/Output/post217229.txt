MB Air: connect, update App Store with broken Wifi/Airport via USB WiFi <body> On my MB Air 2,1 (mid 2009) the wifi is broken. Connecting with the internet is possible via an Apple USB-Ethernet-adapter.  When trying to install an app/update via the App Store (e.g. to OSx El Capitan) the message in App Store is:     Your device or computer could not be verified.   It seems to me a working Wifi Airport Card is a prerequisite for connecting/authenticating with the App Store.   ol liCan anyone confirm this is the issue?/li liIs a work around available?/li /ol  Otherwise I've googled a bit and as far as I can tell the options for this 6 year old machine are either to have the wifi repaired (€125) or buy a USB wifi dongle (€22) and accept that OSx will not be able to update.   Cf. e.g. this post:     A NIC (network interface card) is needed for authentication purposes to make sure the computer is what it claims to be.   on forums.macrumors.com reads like a sound argument.   <answer235716> repair wifi card or logic board then You will can log in usb wifi dongle or ethernet cable won't work. I know this is ridiculous.
