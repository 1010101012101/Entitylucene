How to stop display from turning off when I disconnect a Screen Sharing client <body> I have a Mac which I connect to using Screen Sharing to log in and start a video playing. Since upgrading to El Capitan, when I quit the screen sharing client, the screen on the remote machine turns off. How do I stop this from happening, while still having the screen turn off normally after a few minutes of inactivity?  <answer233069> Under System Preferences  Sharing, use “Remote Management” instead of “Screen Sharing”, as shown here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1i3K3.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Sharing Preference Pane"  As far as I can tell, everything else works the same but the screen no longer turns off when you disconnect a Screen Sharing connection.  emedited to add: this is under 10.11.3/em  <answer245387> I also have this issue (2012 Mac running El Capitan 10.11.5). I did emnot/em have this issue on my 2007 Mac Mini running 10.6.8 with a similar configuration (except using DVI instead of HDMI). When I close Mac screensharing or TouchPad on iOS, or switch iOS apps or lock the phone, the Mac Mini turns off external video.   The workaround I've found is: Hit pause / play on the Apple Remote (the physical infrared remote — not an app) after starting the video, before closing screensharing. Then you should be able to close screensharing and the screen will stay on. I've also done this with the Apple bluetooth mouse and it works as well.   You can also accomplish this by waking the Mac Mini with the remote before initiating screensharing, if you remember. Annoying though since it will often open and start playing iTunes.  The Mac just seems to need some input from a physical device (mouse or remote) after waking to prevent it putting the screen back to sleep.  Going to try the Remote Management checkbox also to see if that helps.   <answer290466> I solved this by restarting the Mac with the display (the TV) already ON.  If starting the Mac with the display off, either using Remote Management or Screen Sharing will result in the display turning off after disconnecting the VNC client.  <answer294454> Run this command in the terminal to fix the external screen going blank on VNC disconnect. Works with Sierra OS.  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement RestoreMachineState -bool NO /code/pre  <comment290432> Perfect, thanks! <comment290850> Sadly, even that does not seem a 100% solution. I wish there was a better way. *sigh* <comment291383> Yeah, it appeared to work, but turns out it only works sometimes. Can't figure out what the pattern is for when it works and when it doesn't.
