That's an error in their video player, not in Safari or macOS. <comment318816> Google says that's a DNS error - name not resolved. It also only seems to come up with Polish language queries, which would maybe suggest some kind of border control. Maybe try a different DNS provider, Google or OpenDNS <comment318817> What does it mean to try different provider? Another web browser? <comment318833> DNS provider - your usual one will be your ISP's own DNS, which is usually the simplest to use. System prefs  Network  [connection type]  Advanced...  DNS. Try putting 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in there instead of your ISP's address [click + & you can replace the existing address, you can't delete the only address] Might need a reboot to refresh. <comment319015> You should do that anyway if your ISP isn't yet providing IPv6
