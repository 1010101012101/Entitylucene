Control iMac and LED Cinema Display Brightness Simultaneously <body> I have a iMac 27'' and a LED Cinema Display 27'' connected to it. And I've noticed that to be able to control brightness I need to open the codeDisplay.prefPanel/code  and modify the brightness of the displays strongindividualy/strong.  Is there a way to do this strongSIMULTANEOUSLY/strong? Maybe with a third party app? If not, is there a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to the second display brightness?  <answer16423> F.lux is worth a look, it changes the colour temperature and brightness of your monitor(s) based on the time of day.  <answer25748> Shades can do this.  (I am pretty sure it can, I only have one monitor attached at the moment, so I can't verify.)  <answer33355> I just started using Dimmer Than Dim, a free app in the App Store. I only have one display (iMac), however.  <comment17937> Sadly F.lux is totally automatic and it really doesn't even change the display brightness. <comment29216> In my testing, Shades can control both individually but not simultaneously <comment38050> How do you control Cinema Display brightness? My Display.prefPanel only have main screen brightness control. <comment73098> Try kbdControl âŒƒ/kbd and kbdF1/kbd or kbdF2/kbd. That should work.
