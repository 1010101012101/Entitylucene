Problems installing powerline fonts on macOS 10.12 <body> I'm pretty new with MacOS and Macbooks in general. I've been a unix user for a long time and right now I'm trying to install the strongpatched powerline fonts/strong to use with OhMyZsh, VIM and the like but I'm running into some issues getting it to properly work.   I've followed a couple different guides but I'm always getting the same strongerror in that some of the special icons/characters show up correctly on the terminal while some others don't/strong and that pretty much screws everything up.   Here's the latest guide I followed (and the simplest one): powerline/fonts and here's a screenshot of how my terminal currently looks like:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H0gK.png" alt="enter image description here"  The fonts do seem to be installed as they show up in the font book.   strongQ: What can I do to so all icons/characters show up correctly?/strong  <answer270160> Fixed. It was me just being dumb.   Everything was properly installed and working but I realized that iTerm2 and the stock Terminal app were set to use a different kind of font so that's why it wasn't displaying some characters.   Going into iTerm2's settings and manually overriding the fonts fixed the issue.
