How to install modules from CPAN without sudo? <body> Is there a way to install modules from CPAN without resorting to codesudo/code?  (And without codeperlbrew/code, please.)  <answer89272> You can configure codecpan/code to install modules outside of the system default path. Point it to some place under your home directory and you shouldn't need to call it with codesudo/code to install modules.  The codeo/code command in the codecpan/code interactive shell lets you change options for codecpan/code and the codemakepl_arg/code option changes the options that are passed to the codeperl Makefile.pl/code call that CPAN makes to build the Makefile for the module.  If you wanted to change the install path to code~/lib/perl5/code you'd do:  precodemkdir -p ~/lib/perl5 perl -MCPAN -e shell /code/pre  And from the CPAN shell:  precodecpan&gt; o conf makepl_arg 'PREFIX=~/lib/perl5' cpan&gt; install MyModule /code/pre  To use modules installed in this location you'll need to add this path to your codePERL5LIB/code environment variable. For bash do:  precodeexport PER5LIB=~/lib/perl5 /code/pre  Or whatever environment variable setting syntax is required by your shell of choice.  There's a nice discussion of customizing CPAN for a single user here.
