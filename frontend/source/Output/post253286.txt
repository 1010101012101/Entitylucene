Export Memories from Photos to Dropbox misses the title <body> I have observed an irritating missing feature in the new Memories feature, in iOS 10. When I wanna save/backup a memory from the Photos app to my Dropbox it does not name the file with the title of the memory. Others that have the same issue, if yes, any workarounds?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZbKOe.png" alt="enter image description here"
