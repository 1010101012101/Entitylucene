How to add a libreoffice launcher for writer? <body> I have libreoffice 4.3.4.1 on OS X 10.10, it only has one libreoffice launcher in spotlight/launchpad. Is it possible to add launchers for subprograms like writer, calc, impress, draw... ?  <answer159878> If you go to Applications, find LibreOffice and right-click Show Contents, does LibreOffice contain separate applications for Calc, Writer, etc? If so, the easiest thing to do would be to drag &amp; drop those on your dock. You could also make aliases and/or symlinks of them.  <comment187946> Found a bug here: https://www.libreoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50278
