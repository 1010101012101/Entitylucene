Apple ID disabled suddenly on Macbook <body> I set up Macbook and did updates and installed some apps. It was like 4 months ago. Then 1 month ago, when I try to update apps like XCode or other App Store apps, I got notification  Your Apple ID has been disabled. For assistance, contact iTunes Support at www.apple.com/support/itunes/ww/.  I thought this was temporary thing, but it's been like this for more than a month.   With this ID I have Apple Developer account and I can use it with on issues. It's not disabled. I can also use it from XCode to sign apps and upload to iTunes.   Anyone knows how to solve this issue?  PS. If I try to add a new Apple ID, although I enter the correct password, a password screen keeps popping up asking me to enter the password again. And there is NO error about the wrong password or any other error. Just popping up.   <comment351213> Did you try contacting iTunes Support as the error indicated you should do?
