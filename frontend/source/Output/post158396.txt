Running OS X Yosemite, but About This Mac shows Version 10.90 <body> In About this Mac it shows that the OS is Yosemite but the version number is 10.90. Is this normal? I thought Yosemite is 10.10, and Mavericks was 10.9.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g0rmH.png" alt="OS X Yosemite Version 10.90"  <answer158402> Download the latest Yosemite installer from the Mac App Store but do not install it.  Copy following in to your Terminal to verify the downloaded Yosemite file is correct:  precodeshasum /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg /code/pre  Wait for a minute for it to calculate. The result for the previous version should be:  precodeeebf02a20ac27665a966957eec6f5e6fe3228a19  /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg /code/pre  And for Yosemite Download as of Nov. 27 the result is:  precodea673c2c6d967f4da2934b7d6cf3736936970b194  /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg /code/pre  Proceed with Install.  <answer158961> Mmmh, maybe you've changed it yourself and forgotten about it?  Changing OS X version to 10.90 has been suggested to solve some compatibility issues, e.g. with Matlab (see MATLab crashes on launch OS X Yosemite).  To change it back to 10.10, type the following in a Terminal window:  precodesudo nano /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist /code/pre  then change the value under 'ProductVersion' to 10.10 or whatever version you fancy.  <comment186215> Your Installation did not go so well :) <comment186216> 10.90 would appear to be one of the beta builds. 'fix' seems to be to install the release over it. <comment186245> I'm getting: a673c2c6d967f4da2934b7d6cf3736936970b194  /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg, when trying to install it prompts "This copy of the “Install OS X” application is too old to be opened on this version of OS X." <comment186248> hmm, my download is from Nov 7 ! <comment186249> mine is from today, but anyway, I can't install it.. ideas? <comment186251> I am re-downloading it to double check. another 40 minutes to wait to confirm. Your checksum is strange for now, do not use it. <comment186252> Wow, I really appreciate that :) <comment186256> OK, I had a older version, then today's version is same as yours a673c2c6d967f4da2934b7d6cf3736936970b194 <comment186257> If you have duplicate version of the "Install OS X Yosemite" (copy) delete the old one and try to install, or use the cmd-r to rebuild from Internet. <comment186258> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/19015/discussion-between-andpy-and-buscar).
