iMac5,1 states it is a Core Duo in "About this Mac" <body> My iMac5,1 states it is a Core Duo in "About this Mac". According to Apple info and other sites, this should be a Core 2 Duo. Any insight?  <comment259827> What does `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` entered in Terminal.app show? Use the output (e.g. T7600) to search for the processor at [Your Source for IntelÂ® Product Specifications](http://ark.intel.com/) to get the full specs.
