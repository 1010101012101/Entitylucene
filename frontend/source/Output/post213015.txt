How to compare files for an entire drive from a before and after (or changes during) state? <body> I would actually very much like an option similar to codefseventer/code, but it appears that not only will it support recent OS releases, but that it is altogether no longer available.  What can I do for 10.10 and later to reproduce the tool's function of listing near-live file system change events?  My first attempt to make a before and after comparison with every file on a drive from one state to the next.  So far all that I've come up with is something like the following:  precodefind -s / -ls &gt; ~/files-before.txt find -s / -type f -exec shasum \{} \+ &gt;&gt; ~/files-before.txt  ### Do Stuff ###  find -s / -ls &gt; ~/files-after.txt find -s / -type f -exec shasum \{} \+ &gt;&gt; ~/files-after.txt  diff files-before.txt files-after.txt /code/pre  But I can't help but think that there must be a better way to really get these results or perhaps to get a realtime presentation of changes over a span of time.  Any thoughts?  <comment257203> Could you be a little specific about what OS version you are targeting? <comment257205> Well I would prefer `10.11` or `10.10`. I am specifically working on `10.11` at the moment. <comment257206> fs_usage is sort of the command line equivalent of fseventer. It works on 10.10, don't know about 10.11 though. It can produce a *lot* of output, so do a man fs_usage to know how to limit that output somewhat. <comment257207> Well, yeah, `fs_usage` is a little more verbose and lacks some easy realtime filtering since you have to `grep` the crap out of it, but it could be workable.
