Where to find factory list in apple serial number  <answer153902> I just downloaded Coconut Battery -- it displays information relating to the Macbook's date of manufacture, and, separately, that of the battery. It's a nice tool; of course, I can't attest to the accuracy of the data presented, but I'm assuming it's pulling the information from somewhere credible. (My Mac itself doesn't seem to provide date of manufacture via the Apple System Information panel.)   <comment107959> I totally agree with Mac Tracker. It is a great little tool for all sorts of valuble info for your Mac including upgrade specs etc. <comment181140> This is not currently accurate.
