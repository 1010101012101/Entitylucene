Esc key replaces my word or adds another in TextEdit <body> I usually use Esc key while using TextEdit. I did some weird combination today so whenever I press Esc, it replaces the word. If there is a selection, it replaces the whole selection with "I". I realized that Edit → Complete does the same. Edit → Complete combination is shown as Option + Esc but it works when I press Esc key only.  How can I change Edit → Complete combination or how can I stop Esc behaving like this?
