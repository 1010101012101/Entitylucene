How to prevent an iPad from grabbing Apple ID for "Itunes and App Store" when plugged into a Mac? <body> I work as an iOS developer and have a number of development iPads at work. They are generic ipads used for testing and demos, none should apple ID.  When I plug such iPad into my mac, two things seems to happen:  ol liiTunes opens and offers me to "set up my new iPad", even if it is already setup/li liI close iTunes/li liI unplug the iPad, but now it has my personal apple ID remembered in "iTunes and app store" in preferences./li /ol  Now at random intervals the ipad asks me for the password for this user ID. I think it even tries to convert that into an iCloud ID. Even worse, I randomly get popups saying "[some random generic company ipad] now uses my apple ID for facetime and iMessage".  strongHow can I permanently lock generic iPads into something so it does not grab my personal apple ID and use it?/strong  <answer173459> I used to get this issue as well and what I did was to prevent iTunes from auto syncing when I connect a device, this option is found in the iTunes Preferences/Devices and tick the checkbox as shown in the screenshot  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pnsIs.png" alt="iTunes Prefrences/Devices"  It's also worth going into the user preferences then login items and remove "iTunes helper" which should stop it from launching iTunes anytime you connect a device.
