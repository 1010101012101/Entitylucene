How to open files from Finder into existing instance of Sublime Text 2? <body> I would like to be able to go into codeFinder/code and open files into an existing instance of codeSublime Text 2/code, which has a side menu with all open files.  However, when I hit codeOpen With/code - codeSublime Text 2.app/code, it opens a whole new instance of Sublime, which is not what I want.  I can certainly accomplish grouping of my documents in a single instance if I open them within the application but that requires more steps and time, i.e. is not always  as convenient as opening them from codeFinder/code.  <answer98952> As shown in this answer on SuperUser, you can set this behaviour by changing the codeopen_files_in_new_window/code setting in Sublime Text to codefalse/code. (Note that it's recommended that you override the setting in the codeSettings - User/code file rather than changing it in codeSettings - Default/code.)  <comment116285> thanks, it is not clear whether the prefs from the S.U. answer pertain to Finder or Sublime <comment116287> Those are definitely Sublime Text's preferences, not the Finder's. <comment116289> unfortunately, those instructions did not work for me.  see my comment on S.U.
