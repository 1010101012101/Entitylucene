Need help verifying my newly created Apple ID <body> I want to create an Apple-ID to download viber on my iPod.   Having selected "None" for the payment method and having inserted my address, it takes me out of there.   So, I don't get an email to verify the Apple-ID.  What's going on?  <answer161772> In my experience, it’s usually Apple’s servers causing the delay. Sometimes it can take a few hours to receive, and/or requires multiple resend requests. The quickest way to resolve the issue is by Contacting Apple ID support directly.  That said, they do have a support article for your issue: strongIf you didn't receive  your Apple ID verification or reset email/strong.   strongTo summarize the basics:/strong     ol   liCheck all your mail folders, including spam and junk. The sender address is strongappleid@id.apple.com./strong/li   liConfirm that you entered your email address correctly in your Apple ID account/li   liCheck that your email client is working properly. /li   liSign into your account at My Apple ID and resend the verification email./li   /ol   <comment189031> I will try again. Is downloading from the app-store the only method to download viber free to my iPod?
