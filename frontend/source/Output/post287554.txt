My phone keeps telling me to try some other time with apps. It's been weeks though! <body> Whenever I try to download any app it says try another time or whatever. It's especially annoying when this app is already in my iCloud but for some reason my phone won't let it download. I need an app for my ap science class can someone pls tel me what to do. I have iPhone 6 that is fully up to date with software.
