On the fly QR code decrypter/decoder app for iOS <body> I need to implement a feature on a shopping cart website.  Basically I need to print out Cost and Weighted Average price of the product on the public product page.  But I need to displayed in an encrypted format.  More importantly, I need an iOS app that when fired up immediately opens the camera scanner, and once it finds the encrypted information, to decrypt it with a SET password, and display the cost and/or weighted average price on the fly.  I'm not sure what to use, but I found that QR codes can be password protected.  The only problem is finding the app that does this properly. There are two apps that read password-protected QR codes. The one doesn't allow you to set up a default password, and everytime you scan, it prompts you for the password. The other one, is buggy, and doesn't allow you to set the default password in the settings.  Anyone come across an app that does this is an efficient way?
