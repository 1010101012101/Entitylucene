How to share internet with WPA/WPA2 security? <body> I'm using a macmini with Mac OS X Snow Leopard to share a cable internet connection. Sharing works fine except that security is limited to 40/128 bit WEP that is insecure (can be hacked in minutes). Is it possible to share the connection via wifi with stronger WPA/WPA2 security? Maybe using some third-party internet sharing app?  <answer48307> This is not supported in Mac OS X 10.7 and lower. See:  ol liCan I secure a Mac&#39;s ad hoc network better than just the default WEP?/li lihttp://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/8339.html/li /ol  Perhaps in the next version of the OS, but currently Lion does not accommodate changing the encryption/authentication protocol of an ad-hoc network based from the device.  Though I have looked, there is no software to my knowledge that supports this feature aside from using a separate OS.  You can dual boot: Some versions of Windows do support this feature.  <answer51345> It seems that a work-around is to boot into an older version of the OS, configure WPA2, and then boot back.  I set up Internet Sharing a few OS versions ago, and the “Airport Setup” screen had a “Security” dropdown to choose between WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA2 Enterprise. Now, running 10.6.8, the “Security” dropdown is gone, and WEP seems to be the only choice. Yet, when I enable sharing on the machine, it still uses the previously-configured WPA2.  <answer60292> Mac OS X Mountain Lion supports Internet Sharing using WPA/WPA2.  You will need to upgrade to get this functionality.  This article has a little more info.  And here is a screenshot of the new option for WPA2 in Mountain Lion (10.8):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X5wMl.png" alt="New WPA2 option for Internet Sharing in Mac OS X Mountain Lion"  <comment55372> Use an AirPort Express instead of a Mac Mini to share the connection. The Mac internet sharing is seemingly designed for temporary *ad hoc* use. <comment55412> possible duplicate of [Can I secure a Mac's ad hoc network better than just the default WEP?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/42522/can-i-secure-a-macs-ad-hoc-network-better-than-just-the-default-wep) <comment59289> So this setting is saved somewhere. Maybe it's a way to modify it without access to previous OS version? <comment76472> Do I have to do something special to get this option? I'm on MacOS X 10.8.1, but I'm just offered "None", "40-bit WEP", and "128-bit WEP"... <comment76478> Never mind. I tried to create a WIFI, but I had to enable internet sharing. I thought it would be the same... ;-) <comment103136> The answer you marked is applicable to Mountain Lion, but your question says you're using Snow Leopard.  Consider revising the question. <comment108656> If @Randy or another Mac expert can locate the configuration file responsible (probably a .plist somewhere) I am sure a way can be found.
