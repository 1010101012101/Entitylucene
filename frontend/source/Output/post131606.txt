How to change default LC_TYPE? <body> My OS X (Mavericks) seems to be setting codeLC_CTYPE/code environmental variable to codeUTF-8/code by default.  How can I change the default? I need codeLC_CTYPE/code to be codeen_US.UTF-8/code.  strongThere's a catch/strong: I don't want to emoverwrite/em default with another value by using codeexport LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8/code in my local code.profile/code or code.bash_rc/code. I'm interested in emchanging/em the default itself, at the very root wherever it comes from, so that it works emwithout/em additional startup scripts (and also I'm curious what controls env vars in OS X :)  The reason I want to change it at the very source is that I want to be able to:  ul lilaunch remote shell quickly in iTerm2, which doesn't run local shell's (slow-ish) startup script/li lihave remote servers inherit my local codeLC_/code variables so that I have UTF-8 support on other machines without having to configure them specifically./li /ul  <answer135454> In Terminal.app you can change the default encoding in the Advanced settings. This will be set before it spawns a shell.  Looks like iTerm2 has the setting under Preferences, Profiles, Terminal.  Is that 'the very source' you are looking for?  <comment160566> adding `LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8` doesn't overwrite anything. You always log into your shell via your $PATH. Otherwise you'd be presented with `bash [version] #` as in recovery mode Terminal. Explicitly including this in your profile is equivalent to modifying the setting described in the answer below. The benefit of including it in your path is that is explicitly defines the ENV for $HOME. This is what you want.
