How to uninstall Jenkins in Homebrew? <body> I have a problem with Homebrew especially with Jenkins formula.  precode$ brew update;brew upgrade Already up-to-date. ==&gt; Upgrading 1 outdated package, with result: jenkins 1.598 ==&gt; Upgrading jenkins ...   /usr/local/Cellar/jenkins/1.598: 6 files, 65M, built in 7 seconds $ brew uninstall jenkins --force Uninstalling jenkins... $ brew cleanup /code/pre  Ok, I strongly believe that I completely uninstalled the formula. The problem is that the Jenkins formula installs every time when I do codebrew update;brew upgrade/code.  How can I uninstall Jenkins completely?
