How to launch an application after a specific Disc was mounted using Automator <body> I'm newbie in Automator. There are many examples for simple actions.  But I could not find examples or documentation for launching some applications after a specific disk was mounted. It will be very useful at work.  Has someone done this?  <answer234083> Open Automator and create a new folder action.  Choose a folder to watch. In my example it's a Mavericks installer thumb drive with the name emSystemUSBMav/em.  Then add emLaunch Application/em from the Automator's library and choose an application to launch.  Save the folder action as emLaunch on Mount/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6akBd.png" alt="Folder Action"  hr  A second approach is a launch agent:  Create a file emlocal.user.mountonlaunch.plist/em in ~/Library/LaunchAgents with the following content:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;local.user.mountonlaunch&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/open&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Volumes/SystemUSBMav&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Load the file with:  precodelaunchctl load /Users/user_name/Library/LaunchAgents/local.user.mountonlaunch.plist /code/pre  hr  The downside of both approaches is that the application will be launched also after ejecting the disk/volume or modifying files in the root of the volume. You may circumnavigate the latter by creating a locked, "fake" watch folder on the volume.  <answer234090> Problem was solved using this great answer.br Just follow 4 simple steps.
