Import Chrome bookmarks in to Safari? <body> How do I import my Chrome (35.0.1916.153) bookmarks in to Safari (7.0.4)?  <answer135839> h2Exporting Your Chrome Bookmarks/h2  Chrome stores bookmarks in a non-HTML format so you need to export them first before you can import them in to Safari.  ol liSelect codeBookmarks &gt; Bookmark Manager/code from the menu bar in Chrome/li liIn the Bookmark Manager UI select codeOrganize &gt; Export Bookmarks to HTML File.../code/li liSelect a location to save the file (I suggest codeDesktop/code) in the File window dialog and click the codeSave/code button/li /ol  h2Import the Exported Bookmarks in to Safari/h2  ol liIn Safari select codeFile &gt; Import Bookmarks.../code from the menu bar/li liNavigate to the folder where you saved the exported HTML bookmarks file, select the file and press the codeImport/code button/li /ol  Your bookmarks will be imported in to a bookmark folder named codeimported &lt;date of import&gt;/code. For example, on the day of writing this answer, my imported bookmarks were placed in a bookmark folder named codeimported 6/22/14/code. You can organize your bookmarks in Safari by selecting codeBookmarks &gt; Edit Bookmarks/code to open the bookmark editing interface in a tab. Move and re-arrange your imported bookmarks to suit your needs.  <answer153860> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ke260.jpg" alt="Safari 8: File » Import From" title="Safari 8: File » Import From"  Just noting that Safari 8 has an option to import directly from Chrome. In Safari, select codeFile &gt; Import From/code from menu bar.  <comment182019> Very clear explanation. Chrome can import bookmarks directly from Safari; too bad it doesn't work the other way also. <comment182781> See the answer below - the new Safari 8 has an option for importing from Chrome. <comment183754> On a related note, Click on `Chrome  Import Bookmarks and Settings` to import in to Chrome. <comment186613> And it does it without creating duplicates! :) <comment262814> I realized this option didn't appear for me because I'm using Chrome Canary... In this case I still had to export bookmarks to a file and then import from Safari.
