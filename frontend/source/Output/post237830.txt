Apple wireless mouse problem in selection item from the list <body> After installing windows on mac,when i boot with windows i want  to select items or deselect from the list of items (like files in explorer or filtering some items in ms application) my mouse does not select correctly , some times it select next item or pervious  item , for example in ms excel when i want to filter something and want select one item from the list it has problem and select other items.  Also when i want to go to bottom or top of the list and select some thing it does not go until end of list and it back to 2 or 3 items before last item.   I do not have this problem with mouse when i am working with macintosh, this problem happened when i work in windows,  <comment291529> First question would be have you replaced the batteries? <comment291537> My mouse is magic mouse 2 , i charged it with mac. <comment291541> About the only thing you can do with a Magic Mouse is to clean it with a can of compressed air.  If your Mac pointer works ok with a different mouse then the issue is with your Magic Mouse.  I'm assuming you tried plugging in a different mouse to verify the Mac works ok?  If so, it might be time for a new mouse. <comment291588> My magic mouse is new, i got it 2 month ago. This problem happened when i am in windows and ms application. When i work with macintosh does not have this problem <comment291611> That would've been good to know in the question.  It's tagged as macbook not windows.  I recommend editing your question with that information in order to get the best answer.
