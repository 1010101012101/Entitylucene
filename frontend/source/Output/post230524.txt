How to get out of this default folder static-30 <body> I recently installed apache ant on my macbook. I think the installation didn't go well. Whenever I go to my terminal now the home folder is emstatic-30/em  How to get rid of this?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLWx5.png" alt="Terminal screenshot"  <comment281381> You need to look at some Unix shell tutorials, there are several things that you seem not to understand in  that screen shot. Nowhere in that shot does it say that the home folder is static-30. static-30 is probably the name of the machine to see what it is we need to know what your prompt is <comment281392> In fact that script show your home directory is /Users/vivaboyme.com (and please copy text as text and not a screen shot so we can copy it and test)
