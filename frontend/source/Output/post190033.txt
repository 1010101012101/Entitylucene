Do all iPad mini models have SIM slots? <body> I currently have an iPad mini 2 WiFi/Verizon. It is a 16GB model.  I want to upgrade to a 128GB model and use my existing SIM card. Do I have to buy a Verizon model, or can I buy a so-called "WiFi-only" model and use my SIM?  Thanks all.  <answer190035> WiFi-only Apple devices do not contain a SIM card tray, unfortunately.  <comment225512> "Wifi only" means you can only access wifi not verizon.  If you also have an iPhone you may want to learn about instant hotspot. https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/continuity/ which will allow you to use the less expensive wifi only iPad and have it get it's internet connection via the iPhone.  (this is a newer feature, not available when you likely purchased the iPad last time).
