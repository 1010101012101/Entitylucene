OS X Calendar Server - way to automate Sharing? (not Delegates) <body> Currently, we have a script that uses calendarserver_manage_delegates to give our office manager read access to all of our calendars. However, the delegation system has a few issues (doesn't work on iOS). So, we've instead been moving to the Sharing model (where you click the radar icon next to the calendar instead of using Prefs - Accounts - Delegation).  But, this is a very time consuming process. Is there any way to create View-Only calendar shares via command line, AppleScripting, or anything else?
