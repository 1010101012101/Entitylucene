Apps don't update from App Store <body> I'm using a Mac Book Pro. In the app store, I click Update and it downloads for half an hour and then it starts installing and halfway through everything just stops on it's work. I've waiting an hour already and it still says installing 3 minutes. It said that an hour ago. I'm trying to update 2 apps and one of them says installing 3 minutes, the other one just tells me to click "update" again because it paused itself.  What's going on why am I having this update/install issue in App Store?  <comment264655> Some updates require other updates in order to work properly (such as the Xcode and Xcode CLI). What are you trying to update? <comment264665> From Xcode 7.1 to Xcode 7.2
