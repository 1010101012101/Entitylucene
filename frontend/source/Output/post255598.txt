Why isn't this Automator Folder Action working to delete old files in my Downloads folder? <body> So I'm not very experienced with Automator, but this seemed simple. I created a Folder Action that any time the Downloads folder got poked, it would also check to see if there were files older than 90 days, and move them to the Trash. Self-cleaning.  Instead, I'm finding that files I download from Google Chrome instantly get moved to the Trash themselves. It's as if the condition doesn't apply. The date modified is clearly that moment, which certainly is within 90 days! What am I doing wrong?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aKqth.png" alt="simple automator script to delete old files that seems to delete the newest file"  <comment318359> Based on some other things I've read, the Filter Finder Items action seems to be broken. You can test to see what it finds by removing the Move action then running it with the Results tab open.
