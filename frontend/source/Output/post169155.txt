Is there any good alternative to winrar archiving utility for mac with ability to browse files before extracting them? <body> I have so far tried Keka and Unarchiver, but they both don't allow browsing the archive content. They simply extract everything contained in the archive which is not a desirable behaviour.  Is there any free (or cheap) alternative to winrar for osx?  <answer169167> I know you said free.. but The Archive Browser is great and will allow you to preview the items before extracting. In my opinion, this is worth the $3.99.  <answer169204> If you just want to quickly see what is in the archive, grab the BetterZip QuickLook plugin.  It is not required to install the BetterZip application.  <comment198604> There were a number of QL Generators around when QuickLook was new, one of which browsed zips/archives. Now they seem to be in app packages ... <comment198661> There's Zipster, which 'mounts' archives somewhat like.dmg files; inline as though they were folders <comment199163> Can it open files directly from the archive? Also, can I update such a file so that it re-archives it again? Thanks!
