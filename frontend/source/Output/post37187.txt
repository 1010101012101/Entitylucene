Where does iPhoto'11 store its photos? <body> Does it work like Aperture and store files in its own directory? If so, where is this?  I'm debating on dropping Aperture to save space on my hard drive, so want to know how iPhoto works before I switch.  Thanks  <answer37191> iPhoto stores its Library in your User-Directory.  The Path: ~/Pictures/  Right-Click on the Package, and then select "Show Package Contnet" to view your pictures!  Or, right-Click on a picture in iPhoto, and select "Show in Finder"  <answer106953> http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2341  The above points out a setting whereby you can control where photos get stored.  <answer136984> MacintoshHD/Users/$YOU$/Pictures/iPhotoLibrary/Masters/$Year$/$Month$/$Date$  Have moved mine now getting to removing iPhoto. I don't categorise my life into events so it is useless to me, I can never find anything.  <comment42209> Regarding access through iPhoto, I have no "Show in Finder" for the one photo I imported into iPhoto when I right-click. This is on iPhoto'11.  Regarding the library, I see it now via Terminal.  Finder must hide the directory/library.

Aperture can work with multiple collections more easily than iPhoto. I switched from iPhoto to Aperture for the same reason, space. :)
