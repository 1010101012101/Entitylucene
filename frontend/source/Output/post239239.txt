Adding partition to disk creates unwanted third partition <body> I'm using disk utility to try to divide the partition I'm working on, which is 51.28 GB, into one main partition (to run OS X on) and one smaller HFS+ partition (on which I will eventually install GRUB to boot Arch Linux, which is in other partitions). However, using Disk Utility, when I have this partition selected and click the + button, whatever size partition I try to create, Disk Utility shrinks the current partition to 25.6 GB, creates a partition of the size I select, and then creates a third partition out of the remaining space. Does anybody know why I might be experiencing this problem? I am running OS X version 10.11.5 on a early 2015 13" Retina MacBook Pro.  <answer239253> Use the following steps.  ol liOpen the Disk Utility application. Highlight the appropriate drive. Below is an example.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hotVA.png" alt="340"/li liClick the the icon labeled Partition. The following popup pane will appear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GX85F.png" alt="331"/li liDetermine the size you want for the new partition. Subtract this value from the size of the current partition. In this example, I need a 30 GB partition, so the difference will be 69.656 GB. Replace the current "Size:" value with this difference, then press the kbdreturn/kbd key.

Since this is your boot drive, which can not be unmounted, you will have to restart the computer. <comment293580> For what you are trying to do, the Disk Utility application can be a useful tool, but you will probably will need to use a few Terminal application commands. If I were you, I probably would have used the Disk Utility to shrink my OS X volume and create a new volume. The instructions above explain how to do this. But after that, I would have booted to Internet Recovery and used the `gpt` command to finish the job. <comment293581> Have restarted, but the same thing is happening.
