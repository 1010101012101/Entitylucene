Can't disable 'Check spelling while typing' in 'Notes' in OSX El Capitan 10.11.6 <body> This is driving me crazy.  In 'Notes', with a note text open/active, I uncheck 'Edit-Spelling and Grammar-Check spelling while typing'. Now the red underlines disappear from words believed to be spelled incorrectly, as expected. I close 'Notes', open it again. The same note text is active, but the red underlines are back. Checking the menu item above, I see that it is now checked again.  How come this setting won't stick when closing/opening 'Notes'? If I open/display another note text, then open/display the first note text, the red underlines are emnot/em back - it is only when 'Notes' is closed that this setting seems to be forgotten.  I have tried this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2577594 (changing some system-wide settings, however written for a different version of OSX) ...but it doesn't help.  Possibly a similar problem (not entirely clear) on OSX Yosemite, however no solution: How to completely, utterly, disable spell-check on OS X Yosemite?  <answer258321> Quit all applications.  System Preferences  Keyboard  Text Tab. On the right side you should see "Spelling : Automatic by Language". In drop down list, choose "Set Up..." then uncheck English.  Nightmare free from those red underlines :D  Drawback: doing so will disable Spelling checking in system wide, while you may want to disable in one specific app only.  <answer269780> strongSolution/strong: Upgrade OS X. In El Capitan, this is simply a bug and there seems to be no workaround. This is fixed in OS X Sierra.  <comment322919> This is the solution suggested by the first link I gave; https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2577594  I have done so, that is, unchecked all languages but one, and left one I don't use checked. Didn't help. <comment322944> Dude, I unchecked English Only!  Uncheck all left one didn't work for me either :)
