How can I use the automator to create text-to-speech service that talks faster than the current service? <body> The text-to-speech service has a speaking rate option that goes from slow to fast. But the fast option is not fast enough (its 300 words per minute).  I just tried to create a service. I simply dragged the "Speak text" action, saved it and tested it. It seems that my new service still relies on the speed option specified in the preferences.   Is there a way for me to tell it something like "render speech at 400wpm"  <answer227182> Do this:  ol liRemove the "strongSpeak text/strong" action./li liAdd the "strongRun AppleScript/strong" action./li liClear all the default text in the action./li liCopy/paste this script in the action:/li /ol   precodeon run {input, parameters}   repeat with thisText in input       say thisText speaking rate 400   end repeat end run /code/pre   If you want a specific voice, append codeusing "SomeVoiceName"/code after the codesay/code command.  Example : codesay thisText speaking rate 400 using "Bruce" -- Bruce is a name of the voice/code  <comment275946> This is fantastic. Just one last thing, is there a way to stop the speech? For example, If I select a big chunk of text and decide I don't want to hear it anymore, is there a shortcut to stop the voice? At the moment I know I can click the cogwheel at the top menu bar and delete it from there but is there a shortcut.  Thanks a lot
