diskutil fails to fix Fusion Drive <body> My iMac suddenly stopped booting, failing to mount the disk at boot.  Running diskutil repair fails with this error:  precodebash-3.2# diskutil repairVolume disk3 Started file system repair on disk3 Macintosh HD Repairing storage system Checking volume disk0s2: Scan for Volume Headers disk1s2: Scan for Volume Headers disk0s2: Scan for Disk Labels disk1s2: Scan for Disk Labels Logical Volume Group A8FAA178-6011-40B8-9138-AC3500CE05DA spans 2 devices disk0s2+disk1s2: Scan for Metadata Volume Logical Volume Group has a 206 MB Metadata Volume with double redundancy Start scanning metadata for a valid checkpoint Load and verify Segment Headers Load and verify Checkpoint Payload Load and verify Transaction Segment Incorporate 0 newer non-checkpoint transactions Load and verify Virtual Address Table Load and verify Segment Usage Table Load and verify Metadata Superblock Load and verify Logical Volumes B-Trees Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volume Load and verify A9822895-14D4-4304-9167-BCD2C5F75269 Load and verify 2323EBF3-1631-4A3E-8078-6B5D506D09CD Load and verify Freespace Summary Load and verify Block Accounting Load and verify Live Virtual Addresses Newest transaction commit checkpoint is valid Load and verify Segment Cleaning The volume A8FAA178-6011-40B8-9138-AC3500CE05DA appears to be OK Storage system check exit code is 0 Error: -69846: Unrecognized file system /code/pre  Such error is quite weird considering it was JUST reading information from that filesystem.  How can I fix my disk and recover my files?

I solved it by doing the following steps:  ol liBacked up the entire volume as a DMG file (to an external drive). The file must be formatted as Read/Write, since the partition is corrupt and therefore requires repair before it is mounted./li liAfter the back up is complete, verify the DMG is mountable and the files are accessible./li liFrom Disk Utility, Verify and Repair the DMG and remove any remaining errors./li /ol  At this point you should delete the original partition. But because CoreStorage made the disk effectively read only, it is not possible to reformat the disk. (Disk Utility will show the error "Unable to delete the core storage logical volume") So instead:  ol start="4" liDelete the CoreStorage group from command line: codesudo diskutil cs deleteLVG A8FAA178-6011-40B8-9138-AC3500CE05DA/code/li liIn Disk Utility GUI, select one of the two drives that were split from the Fusion Drive. The GUI will ask you to merge them back to a Fusion Drive and format them for you./li liRestore the DMG backup./li /ol  <comment294623> Added the output of the commands to the question. <comment294624> The output added looks fine. There are no hints of failing disks/volumes or bogus partition maps. Did you boot the Mac to an external drive/thumb drive with an older system? Did you already try to boot to Recovery Mode/Internet Recovery Mode and verify the disks there? <comment294625> These commands were run from the recovery mode. Disk Utility's GUI gives more or less identical results. Also, fsck_hfs seems to always run in read-only mode. <comment294670> Disk Utility is not always helpful. That said it may be time to invest in a 3rd party disk repair program. My go to is DiskWarrior, but there are others that many people swear by. <comment294699> Each and every utility I tried, including DiskWarrior, treats my disk as read only (It's not mounted of course), even in single user mode. I even made a complete disk image of it, which is still treated as read only. fsck_hfs keeps printing "NO WRITE" no matter how and when I use it. For some reason though, in Single User Mode I am still able to see my files.
