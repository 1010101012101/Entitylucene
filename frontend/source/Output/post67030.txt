Is there an alternative to the five-finger swipe out gesture, allowing me to copy things to/from the desktop? <body> On my MacBook, I frequently end up with lots of overlapping windows on the screen, obscuring the desktop. I recently discovered the five finger 'swipe outwards' gesture that displays the desktop. Unfortunately this doesn't do exactly what I want; as soon as I select an application (typically a Finder window) from the dock, all the windows swipe back into place. Normally I am wanting to copy a file to/from a Finder window that's already open, via drag-and-drop, to the desktop - but I can't do this as the desktop is once again obscured.  Are there any other shortcuts which could help me? For example, minimize/hide all windows to show the desktop?  I should add I'm using OS X 10.8, if it's relevant.  <answer67033> You can do this with copy 'n' paste:  strongFrom Finder to Desktop/strong  ol liSelect the file in the finder/li liPress kbd⌘/kbd+kbdc/kbd/li liPress kbdF11/kbd (show the desktop)/li liRight click on the desktop/li liPaste the item/li /ol  strongFrom Desktop to Finder/strong  ol liOpen the folder in the finder/li liPress kbdF11/kbd/li liSelect the file in the finder/li liPress kbd⌘/kbd+kbdc/kbd/li liPress kbdF11/kbd (it goes back to the finder)/li liPaste the file in your folder/li /ol  hr  Alternatively you can use drag-n-drop:  strongFrom Finder to Desktop/strong:  ol liSelect the file in the Finder/li liClick on the file and hold the finger/li liPress kbdF11/kbd (show the desktop)/li liPress kbd⌥/kbd/li liRelease the file/li /ol  strongFrom Desktop to Finder/strong  ol liOpen the folder in the Finder/li liPress kbdF11/kbd/li liClick on the file and hold the finger/li liPress kbdF11/kbd/li liPress kbd⌥/kbd/li liRelease the file in your folder/li /ol  hr  If you don't care about the position of the object you are copying on the desktop you can also:  ol liClick on your file and hold the finger/li liPress kbd⌥/kbd/li liRelease the file on the Desktop icon, which is in the left column of each Finder window./li /ol  Unfortunately this work only in one direction (finder  Desktop)  hr  N.B. kbdF11/kbd should be replaced by kbdfn/kbd+kbdF11/kbd if the voice codeUse all F1, F2, etc keys as standard function keys/code is not selected in codeSystem Preferences/code  codeKeyboard/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AsR5J.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer67038> I would suggest you set up a hot corner to show the desktop (this is what I do):  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liClick Mission Control/li liClick the "Hot Corners..." button at the bottom/li liSet the corner you want to use for "Desktop" (I use the top right)/li liClick OK/li /ol  Now you can move a file from a Finder window to the desktop with just the mouse:  ol liClick and drag the file you want to move to the hot corner you set up, which will show the desktop/li liDrop the file on the desktop/li /ol  <comment78974> So, let me better understand. You would like to copy a file, see the desktop, and paste I there, is that right? Do you want to use only the trackpad or also the keyboard is ok? <comment78977> I want to copy a file to/from the desktop from an existing Finder window which is already open, when my desktop is obscured by windows. I don't really mind too much if it's trackpad/keyboard or a combination. <comment78980> OK, thanks. It looks like F11 (which is actually Fn-F11, of course) is the equivalent of the five-finger swipe out. This method works, but it seems quite cumbersome; I guess I was hoping for a drag-and-drop way. But thanks, this is closer than what I had. <comment78982> @AndrewFerrier I see, I've updated the answer <comment78986> Your answer now doesn't make any sense to me. How can I drag it when the window is obscured? That was my question in the first instance. <comment78987> @AndrewFerrier I tried it. Are you referring to form finder to desktop or the opposite? <comment78988> Either. F11 hides all the windows. How can you drag to/from a window that's hidden? <comment78989> @AndrewFerrier Probably I used a wrong term. You have to click on the file and hold the finger, press `F11`, hold `option`, and you will be able to realse the file on the desktop <comment78990> Yuck, I like that less than your previous answer! Drag and press Fn and F11 at the same time? ;) I see that it works, but it seems very cumbersome... <comment78991> @AndrewFerrier Ok, probably for me it's easier because I don't have to press `Fn`. I'will put both the options in the answer. <comment78993> @AndrewFerrier Done, now the reader can choose its favorite one ;) <comment78999> @AndrewFerrier I just remembered a third solution. Find it in my answer. Can we remove all these discussion comments? <comment79002> Perfect! This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for; a single drag-and-drop action. Thanks. <comment79003> Yeah, hot corners are great. I have mine set up to invoke Mission Control too, so I can drag files between windows of different apps in the same way. <comment79056> +1 that's exactly what I do. Great answer!
