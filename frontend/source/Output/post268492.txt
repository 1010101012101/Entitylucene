Can't load a specific webpage using Chrome or Safari while logged in, but they work on other account and Firefox also works <body> I'm trying to access The Guardian's website, and I get errors with both Safari and Chrome.  In Safari:     strongSafari Can't Open the Page/strong      Safari can't open the page "https://www.theguardian.com" because Safari can't establish a secure connection to the server "www.theguardian.com".   In Chrome:     strongYour connection is not private/strong      Attackers might be trying to steal your information from strongtheguardian.com/strong (for example, passwords, messages or credit cards). NET::ERR_CERT_REVOKED   strongEDIT/strong: The problem appears to have morphed somewhat in Safari, and I've found the same issue with Kinja. Now, instead of it refusing to load the page, it loads a page that looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL9KG.png" alt="enter image description here"  Both sites appear to have certificates issued by GlobalSign Organization Validation CA, and both have the error "This certificate has an invalid issuer".  When I use Safari on my wife's user account or use Firefox on my own account, the website loads fine. How can I fix my browsers on my user account such that they also successfully load the website?  So far, I've unsuccessfully tried:  ul liIn Safari, going to Preferences  Privacy, clicking 'Manage Website Data…' and deleting everything./li liGoing into Keychain Access and resetting my login keychain to the default./li liDeleting the Safari-relevant folders in code~/Caches/code./li /ul  Neither fixes the problem, but the problem is not present on other user accounts, so I don't think it can be a system-level issue.  <answer268576> So, after an evening of poking at the situation and trying to work out what's going on, I eventually worked it out.  As it transpires, there was an issue with the CRL and OCSP caches on my account on my iMac – other users did not have the same problem as a result. These caches are not deleted by deleting anything from code~/Caches/code, which is why the issue didn't resolve when I tried that.  The answer came from the Apple Developer Forums, who pointed me to a page on the GlobalSign website. The solution is to open Command Prompt/Terminal and enter one of the following commands, then reboot.  h3Windows/h3  precodecertutil -urlcache * delete /code/pre  h3OS X (pre-Sierra)/h3  precodesudo rm /var/db/crls/*cache.db /code/pre  h3 macOS Sierra/h3  precodesqlite3 ~/Library/Keychains/*/ocspcache.sqlite3 'DELETE FROM ocsp;' /code/pre  <comment337168> Clear the caches/cookies from Chome and Safari? <comment337204> No, I tried that – doesn't seem to work.
