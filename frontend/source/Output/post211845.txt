Finder randomly changes language in sidebar favourites <body> I have a pretty weird problem. I have an iMac and have just had my old HDD replaced with an SSD. The old HDD is now in my optical drive's slot.   I have a clean installation of El Captain on my SSD. Unfortunately, the guys who swapped the drives for me installed El Captain in Polish. Now I changed the OS language to English as I'm more used to it, and this is what my Finder does.  I still have an old OS installed on the other disk, which is not formatted yet. I thought that it might be by some miracle conflicting with the new installation, but Finder does this even after unmounting the old HDD.   I have absolutely no idea what to do with this, and it gets very annoying.  Has anyone had this problem before? Uncle Google brings no answers on this one :|  <comment255770> This is not a programming question, and would be better off asked on a site related to using/configuring OS X. <comment255771> Your best guess is at http://superuser.com ... look for tags `osx` and `finder` <comment255772> you guys are right. thx.
