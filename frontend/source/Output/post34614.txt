Can't connect to iPod: iTunes claims iPod Touch needs passcode entered <body> At some point my daughter entered the wrong passcode too many times on her iPod Touch 2nd gen.  I'm trying to reset the iPod as follows:  ol liUnplug the cable from the ipod/li liturn the iPod off by holding down the sleep/wake button and dragging the red arrow across the screen/li liHold down the home button and connect the USB cable to the iPod/li liKeep holding the home button until the "connect to itunes" screen comes up/li /ol  The problem is directly afterwards itunes always complains, stating "itunes could not connect to the iphone because it is locked with a passcode. You must enter your passcode on the iPod before it can be used with iTunes"  The issue is that the iPod is stuck at the "connect to itunes" screen so I cannot enter the passcode.  <answer35627> I have the solution for you here.  ol liPlug the iPod into iTunes/li liHold the power and home button together until the screen goes black/li liLet go of the power button, keeping home pressed/li liafter 10 seconds let go./li liopen iTunes and click restore iPod./li /ol  you have a blank iPod, and will need to sync again  strongUpdate/strong (from original poster)  These steps are correct, I had to actually go to the Genius Bar to find that out because the instructions on Apples own site are not correct.  Specifically they do not recommend the two-button shutdown, but rather a regular shutdown which does not work.
