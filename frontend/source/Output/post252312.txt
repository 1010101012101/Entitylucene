Can I track my workout and listen to music with Apple Watch Series 2 without having to carry my iPhone? <body> I do not have any experience with the Apple Watch, currently I am just using an iPhone. Before I buy an Apple Watch I would like to verify my question.  I know I need to pair it with an iPhone. But from what I have gathered, the new Apple Watch Series 2 is much more independent then the previous version.  ol liTracking should be possible with the GPS module./li liPairing a bluetooth headphone is possible./li liPlaying music without iPhone is also possible./li /ol  Am I right? Or are there any limitations I have missed?  <answer252316> You are correct on all three counts.  The Workout app will work without your iPhone, at least. Third-party apps might need to be updated to be completely independent. Strava, for instance, won't start without an active iPhone connection, but Runkeeper will.  Both the first generation ï£¿WATCH and Series 2 support syncing of a single playlist up to either 2GB or 250 songs.  <comment313979> Apple watch has 5,7GB of storage , so you have more room for songs.
