"control +a" not working on mac, but "control + e" works <body> Today kbdcontrol/kbd+kbda/kbd combination stopped working. So I cannot move cursor to beginning of line in terminal or browser input.   Although yesterday it was working well. kbdcontrol/kbd+kbde/kbd works good.  In codeeventViewer of KeyRemap4MacBook app/code I cans see that when I press kbdcontrol/kbd+kbda/kbd, kbdcontrol/kbd key is logged, but kbda/kbd key not logged.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9T0te.png" alt="&quot;control&quot; key is logged, but &quot;a&quot; key not"  When I press kbda/kbd key without control it is typed in any application and logged in eventViewer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4zjGM.png" alt="&quot;a&quot; key is logged without control"  Why kbdcontrol/kbd+kbda/kbd not working? How to enable it?  <answer115278> The reason was application codeMusic Player for VK Lite/code. When quit it, kbdcontrol/kbd+kbda/kbd start working again.
