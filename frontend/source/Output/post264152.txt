org.apache.httpd automatically readded to launchctl after removing it? <body> This issue is worrying me. One day I saw that Apache was running, and I never set it up to run. It is only on root's launchctl.  I did codesudo launchctl remove org.apache.httpd/code and codesudo launchctl stop org.apache.httpd/code. It was gone then for a little bit, but has eventually been readded to launchctl.  Why? How can I debug this? It isn't a brew service, and I have never desired to use Apache. I checked Apache access log and there was nothing there, the vhost config seems default, so I wouldn't emthink/em it's something malicious, but maybe? EtreCheck gives no red flags for me. I am good with Linux, but not fully sure if maybe something Apple-related is readding the service?  Only thing of interest is in system.log of:     Dec  2 14:04:44 MacBookPro com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (org.apache.httpd): Please switch away from OnDemand to KeepAlive.      Dec  6 10:41:49 MacBookPro com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.xpc.launchd.user.domain.501.100007.Aqua): Could not read path: path = /Users/username/Downloads/org.apache.httpd.plist, error = 2: No such file or directory   but is probably not useful. Thanks for any ideas!  <comment331005> Getting an output after entering `sudo launchctl list | grep apache` doesn't mean that apache is running! Did you see httpd in Activity Monitor/ps? <comment331006> @klanomath Yes, httpd was running, and it was invoked via launchctl. <comment331007> Please add your system version and did you buy, install and configure Apple's Server.app? <comment331009> I haven't installed nor used Apple Server to the best of my knowledge. Only thing I have manually installed from Apple is Xcode (for Homebrew), but I never use Xcode manually nor have touched its settings. I am on 10.12.1 Sierra. <comment331011> Some brew formulas may offer to install and start an apache launch daemon (with brew services...). How big is your `brew list` output? Did you search your .bash_history or .bash_sessions/*.history files for anything interesting/suspicious (*=some UUID)? <comment331012> I am 100% sure httpd was invoked and (re)added to root's launchctl, and I never give brew root, so I do not think brew would be responsible. Regardless, `brew services list` has no Apache there, only nginx which is intentional. `brew list` only relation to Apache is `ab`, but that doesn't include the server (and couldn't be from it anyways since I would never allow it root). bash_sessions only Apache relation is my debugging to find out the cause. BTW, it was running from /usr/sbin/httpd, so rules out brew as well.
