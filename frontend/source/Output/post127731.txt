Google chrome wants to use the keychain password frequently <body> Google chrome wants to use the keychain password frequently in my mac system(OSX version 10.9.2).  Before updating the OS to new version, the applications like Textedit, Preview are used to ask the password while accessing them. If I click the cancel button twice, the popup will be disappeared. But, after updating to new OS version, a popup saying codeGoogle chrome wants to use the keychain password/code without any reason.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0DciX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I need to click the cancel button for eight to twenty times to disappear the popup. While writing this question that dialog box appears three times. Sometimes, I keep that alert box to the bottom like below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5iVJz.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried deleting the password for Chrome in keychain, as suggested in this link. But, no use.  <comment149649> Have you tried entering the password instead of cancelling it each time? <comment149650> @Rob, I entered the password one time and after sometime, it asks the password again.

Does it's session expire in 30 minutes? I generally use Chrome for only SE sites, gmail and Cricinfo. <comment149784> Read this answer to see if it helps you http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/127155/google-chrome-vs-my-keychain <comment149788> @Buscar웃, yes it works. <comment149789> OK than, your question will be closed as duplicate, nothing personal :) <comment149790> @Buscar웃, I already voted to close ;)
