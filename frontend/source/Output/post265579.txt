Notes won't sync via IMAP in macOS Sierra <body> Recently I updated my MacBook from Mavericks to Sierra and everything is going wellâ€¦ except the sync of my notes. I don't want to use iCloud sync because I don't want my notes on a foreign server. Yes, I am aware, that the new features are not supported by IMAP but I don't use them. I just use unformatted text.  What I have tried so far:  ul lidisabling the account, reboot, an re-enabling it - didn't work/li lideleting  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes - didn't work/li lifollowing the description here: How to Sync Notes El Capitan to iOS 9 via IMAP - didn't work/li lisearching the internet - no further hints/li /ul  How can I get this sync back to work?  <comment333094> Restoring the NotesV2.storedata file from a Time Machine backup "restores" the notes. But the sync is still not working. I'm not sure whether the old file put a copy of my notes into the Notes.app or forced a single synchronisation.
