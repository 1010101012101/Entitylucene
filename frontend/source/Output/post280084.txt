Mac laptop cannot connect to disk on Mac desktop <body> I have two Macs, both running Mac OS Sierra. I can ssh from the laptop to the desktop and use Apple's screen sharing to view the desktop's screen from the laptop. I emcannot/em mount the desktop's disks on the laptop. I have Sharing turned on, both AFP and SMB, but I cannot connect via either. I've tried connecting to the desktop via smb://, smb://.local, and directly by its local IP address (and the same for afp://). codessh &lt;hostname&gt;.local/code works, so it's not a DNS resolution issue.  The specific error I get is:     The server may not exist or it is unavailable at this time. Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try again.   Edit: I should mention that when I try to connect by selecting the machine through the Finder sidebar, it doesn't connect, and clicking "Connect As" fails before getting to the password screen.  <answer280238> Make sure you have the user enabled in sharing (File sharing/options) Then try ssh localusername@hostname.local  <answer280457> The problem is my fault; I'd set up File Sharing not only in Sharing preferences like normal, but also in the Server app, and I'd set an access restriction so that only clients with code172.16.*.*/code IP addresses could connect and my network is configured as a code192.168.*.*/code network.  <comment352252> Have you tried sharing with SMB disabled? <comment352475> ssh already works; I want to mount the hard drive on my laptop over the network. <comment352476> I have not, actually. You're recommending I try just AFP? <comment352495> Yah. SMB is for Windows machines to connect to the server. <comment352498> In response to your comment to user2720970's answer: are you trying to mount Macintosh HD, or just folders contained within? <comment352626> sudo mkdir /Volumes/SHARENAME; sudo mount_afp afp://localusername: localusername@hostname.local/SHARENAME /Volumes/SHARENAME <comment352651> I'm actually trying to mount an attached disk, I was able to do this a few months ago, and I was presented with the options for Macintosh HD and the attached disk. <comment352655> @IconDaemon I've turned on AFP and turned off SMB, as well as disabling the firewall and Little Snitch; I get the same error from my original questions. <comment352663> I ran `$ sudo mount_afp afp://user@hostname.local/diskName /Volumes/diskName/` and got:  "mount_afp: AFPMountURL returned error -1069, errno is -1069". <comment352687> Get Info on the attached disk and click the "Ignore ownership on this volume" checkbox. You may need to authenticate with an administrative account by clicking the lock icon. Also: what kind of attached disk? USB, Firewire, Thunderbolt, etc? <comment352795> Thanks for helping, I found out my problem was my own stupid configuration settings. I gave you an upvote as your answer is more likely to be of use to people. <comment352796> @IconDaemon I figured out my issue, it was a bad configuration on my part. If you would like to put your comments into an answer, I'll upvote them so future people may see them more readily.
