Can't compile source code on mac <body> I already have xcode installed on OSX Yosemite. I have also run it and accepted terms and conditions.  I can also do codegcc --version/code and I see  precodeConfigured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.1.76) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0 Thread model: posix /code/pre  Now if I do  precodewget http://apache.mirrors.pair.com//httpd/httpd-2.4.17.tar.bz2 brew install pcre tar zxvf httpd-2.4.17.tar.bz2 cd httpd-2.4.17 ./configure /code/pre  The error I get is   precodeConfigure: configure: Configuring Apache Portable Runtime Utility library... configure: checking for APR-util... yes checking for gcc... /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/OSX10.10.xctoolchain/usr/bin/cc checking whether the C compiler works... no configure: error: in `/Users/abhi/Downloads/httpd-2.4.17': configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables See `config.log' for more details /code/pre  Why can't the C compiler create executable? I showed you that the C compiler is installed correctly on my machine.  <answer216582> In general, having Xcode installed isn't enough to get some open source projects to compile.  The actual error you are seeing is probably listed in codeconfig.log/code since the test it makes is failing on OS X. It's hard to guess if that's because it doesn't like clang/llvm which is what your "codegcc/code" binary actually is.  Some boilerplate things to try:  precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  That should issue an error like "xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates" when you have all the tools actually installed. If you don't have the tools and include files installed, you should get a prompt to install the tools and have to possibly type an admin user/password.  Next, you could dig into the actual specific error log or you could try getting a gcc compiler instead of using Apple's llvm.  precodebrew install gcc /code/pre  That would get a gnu codegcc-5/code installed in the code/usr/local/bin/code path and if that's used over Apple's code/usr/bin/gcc/code you might not have the build error in the first place.  <answer216903> You need to convince configure that there are more c compilers than gcc. Try:  precodeexport CC=clang /code/pre  <answer253294> Start Xcode, select 'Preferences', then 'Locations'. You'll notice a dropdown control at 'Command Line Tools'. Select the newest version, close the dialog window, then call brew again.  <comment261767> For current OS X gcc is not the C compiler - you have not shown the C compiler is installed correctly - The C compiler is clang <comment261768> @Mark but `gcc` is symlinked to `clang` by default, and in straightforward case the invocation is `gcc`-compatible. @KnowsNotMuch have you indeed  ``See `config.log' for more details`` as the autoconf suggested? <comment261769> @Saran it is not linked to clang - could you point to some documentation that says so <comment261770> Have you installed the command line tools? <comment261771> @Mike OK my bad it's not _symlinked_. However it does just run a copy of clang: here's my shell output `oxygen:~ saran$ gcc clang: error: no input files`. Also if I recall correctly, the command `gcc` wouldn't even run without the command line tools installed. <comment262148> I tried both your suggestions and this is what i got `Last login: Sat Nov 21 22:58:10 on ttys000 MacBook-Pro:~$ xcode-select --install xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates MacBook-Pro:~$ brew install gcc Warning: gcc-5.2.0 already installed MacBook-Pro:~$` <comment262149> yes command line tools are installed
