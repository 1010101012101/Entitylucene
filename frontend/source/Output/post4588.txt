What is Best Practice when storing MacBooks for over a month? <body> We have a pod of 30 MacBooks and MacBook Pros that don't get used over the holidays.   What's best practice to store the laptops for 6 weeks? I know that when you store laptops for long periods at half charge, unplugged in a cool place is a good idea, but in practice I've just put them plugged-in in the storeroom! Could anyone share their best practice methods when storing these sort of devices?  <answer4591> Power it down and make sure it's somewhere where there is no chance of it getting wet.  <answer4606> That's what I think Apple suggests when you need to store you MacBook for longer periods:   ul lidischarge your battery to 50% and keep the laptop in a cool place/li liif you plan to not use the computer for more than 5 months take the battery off the laptop/li liyou will probably need to charge the battery every 6 months to better preserve it. /li /ul  <comment4469> You could look at this discussion http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2525736&tstart=0 <comment4478> *Pod of MacBooks*.... sounds like some kind of horror film that would make Steve Ballmer scream like a little girl.
