Using Finder, how can I view /System/Library? <body> Using Finder, how can I view code/System/Library/code?  In fact, I'd really like to do the equivalence of a recursive codegrep/code for file names from the root directory using Finder. How can I move around the entire file system with Finder?  <answer223571> Press strong⇧⌘G/strong (Shift-Command-G) to bring up strongGo to Folder/strong and type in the path, then click strongGo/strong emas shown in the image below/em.  Or if using the mouse or trackpad, click: strongFinder/strong  strongGo/strong  strongGo to Folder/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XC9i2.png" alt="Go to Folder"  You can also change Finder Preferences to show Hard disks on the Desktop under General and or in Devices under Sidebar, thus being able to open the Macintosh HD from the emroot/em of the partition without having to use Go to Folder.  <comment271180> in terminal: open /any/path/ <comment271197> You can also manually toolsgo to folder, or whatever it is!
