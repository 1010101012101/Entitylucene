How can I advertise my app on the App Store? <body> When I released my iOS app on the App Store, how can iPhone user know that this new app is released?  I mean, I do not advertise my app anywhere.  So if my app is already released to App Store, I think no one can know about my newly released app. Is that right?  If they don't know my newly released app, my iOS apps are just useless. I don't want to advertise with money for my app because I am just a beginner iOS developer. So I don't that much have money.  Is there anyway let user to know about my newly released app without money advertisement?  <answer54790> You can link to apps in the appstore. For example:  http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinball-arcade/id455826958?mt=8  (This is just a random app I picked to serve as an example)  Now, if you have your link to your app, you can:  ul liWrite a blog about the app and link to it/li liHave websites review your app and they will link to it/li liDoes your app serve the need of a particular community? Maybe they have a forum or mailinglist where you can link to your app and explain the benefits they will get from it./li liTweet, facebook or Google+ about the app/li /ul
