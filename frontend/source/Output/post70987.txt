What does the keyboard shortcut ⌥⇞ mean? <body> I'm in need of a translator for kbdb⌥ ⇞/b/kbd  This screen shot below is from the TexStudio and Texmaker latex editors.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnDkP.png" alt="screen capture of two glyphs"  <answer70989> strong⌥/strong - Is the strongOption/strong key, also called strongAlt/strong.  strong⇞/strong - It's called strongUpwards Arrow with Double Stroke/strong, and usually represents empage up/em. If your keyboard lacks that specific key, doing kbdFn/kbd+kbd↑/kbd does the trick.  <comment85693> I can't understand why Apple's keyboards print the command symbol on the Command key, but don't print the option/alt and control symbols on their respective keys.
