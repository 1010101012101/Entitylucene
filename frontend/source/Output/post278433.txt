Export artwork to jpg file <body> My goal is to find an automated method to transfer the album artwork in iTunes to folder.jpg in every album folder so my NAS can see it. Over the years I have built up quite a substantial collection of CDs. I ripped them all to mp3 and have been managing them in iTunes. I want to migrate my collection to my NAS and use the built-in iTunes server. However, for artwork to appear it needs the artwork in a a file named folder.jpg. Based on my research so far, there are 2 problems I need to solve:  ol liEmbed all the iTunes artwork from iTunes into the mp3 files themselves. I currently have a mixture of embedded in mp3 file and stored in iTunes database./li liExport embedded artwork to file named folder.jpg for each album./li /ol  I have come across some potential solutions that might work on macOS. But, I only have a PC available.  <comment350377> Yes, I run iTunes on Windows. The NAS is QNAP and runs an embedded Linux OS. But, I would spin up a Linux box if it will solve the problem. :)
