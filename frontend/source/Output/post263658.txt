Symlinking /User/SpecialFolder to different drive creates Folder in Folder <body> Just finished re-installing macOS Sierra on my MBP and am trying to move the ~/Downloads and other folders to a different drive so they end up in /Volumes/Data/ instead.  I created a /Volumes/Data/Downloads folder and emsymlinked/em from one to the other like so:  precodesudo ln -s /Volumes/Data/Downloads Downloads /code/pre  This works more or less, but it creates another emDownloads/em folder eminside/em the /Volumes/Data/Downloads folder so the full path would be  precode/Volumes/Data/Downloads/Downloads /code/pre  Any Idea what I'm doing wrong? So it looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JjsjK.png" alt="Downloads inside Downloads"  <answer263659> Try writing full path instead, I think what you wanted to write is:  precodesudo ln -s /Volumes/Data/Downloads ~/Downloads /code/pre  <answer263668> This occurred because you already had something in your home directory called "Downloads" - the codeln/code command is smart enough not to write over it, so instead created the symlink emwithin/em it.  If you're starting from scratch you can codemv ~/Downloads ~/Volumes/Data//code; if you've already successfully copied your Downloads directory you can simply delete the old one in your home directory: coderm -Rf ~/Downloads/code.  After that your original codeln/code command should work. You shouldn't need to prefix it with codesudo/code:  precodeln -s /Volumes/Data/Downloads ~/Downloads /code/pre  Or, as fd0 suggested, instead of using coderm/code you could use codeln -s -f/code option to unlink the directory. Thus creating the desired results:  precodeln -s -f /Volumes/Data/Downloads ~/Downloads /code/pre  <comment330336> What directory (folder) are you in when you run the command? <comment330340> I'm in *my* homefolder As in /User/Username <comment330342> Same thing happens <comment330343> Can you run 'ls -l' from terminal from /Volumes/Data/Downloads and show the result? <comment330345> Also try  `sudo ln -s /Volumes/Data/Downloads /Users/{userName}/Downloads` and make sure <comment330346> OK, thanks. Did ~/Downloads exist before you made the symlink? (I can recreate this, but only when I first create a source directory with the same name as the symlink). <comment330347> Also try  `sudo ln -s /Volumes/Data/Downloads /Users/{userName}/Downloads`  and make sure the folder '/Users/{userName}/Downloads' does not exists <comment330353> Yes, ~/Downloads is the default directory inside the user directory, just as ~/Documents or ~/Music - it's those _default_ directories that I want in on a different drive. I don't want to move the whole User folder as I want to keep the ~/Library in it's original place. (That is on the SSD that houses the OS too. The symlinked folders on /Data are on an HDD) <comment330355> _ls -l_ gives the following: `$ ls -l .  total 0 .  drwxr-xr-x  265 username  admin  9010 Nov 21 12:00 Documents .  drwxr-xr-x    2 username  admin    68 Dec  5 12:56 Downloads .  drwxr-xr-x  243 username  admin  8262 Dec  5 12:58 DownloadsOLD .  drwxr-xr-x   28 username  admin   952 Nov 20 18:48 Movies .  drwxr-xr-x    9 username  admin   306 Jul 11  2014 Music` .  Where _Downloads_ is the folder I am trying to link to.    Should I remove the default /Users/UserName/Downloads before trying? <comment330357> Yes, you already backed it up, so you just need to remove the directory <comment330358> Thanks you @John-N this did the trick. I read about this in so many places, but it _seems_ none mentioned to remove the original folder <comment330379> Instead of using `rm`, you could use `ln` 's `-f` option to unlink the directory. Thus creating the desired results.
