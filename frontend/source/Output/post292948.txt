How does EFI differentiate each bootable volume? <body> As is explained here and here, when POST is completed EFI chooses an operating system, the location of which is stored in NVRAM.     If multiple installations of OS X are available, BootROM chooses the one that was last selected by the Startup Disk System Preference. The user can override this choice by holding down the Option key while the computer boots, which causes EFI to display a screen for choosing the boot volume.   Is EFI looking for or registering the boot.efi files on each volume? Is that how it recognizes and lists each operating system?  Does EFI search each volume for the boot.efi file or are they registered with EFI during installation?
