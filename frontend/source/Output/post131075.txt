How to remove my Photo Stream from my phone without losing any photos <body> I need to make space on my phone to upgrade iOS, and an 800 MB Photo Stream looks like a pretty good candidate for removal.  The only problem is that it's very unclear to me what happens if I remove the Photo Stream: are the photos deleted from other devices?  (I'm not talking about deleting individual photos from the photo stream, but rather turning off Photo Stream on that device.  Apple doesn't make the consequences of that action 100% clear, and things I've read (which I hope are wrong) suggest that any removal on one device is carried over to other devices.  <answer131088>    What happens to my photos if I turn off My Photo Stream?

My phone makes copies to save to the photo stream, but it remains in the camera roll.
