Can I use a USB headset with my iPad's camera connection kit? <body> I know the camera connection kit can be used with USB microphones, but I'm wondering if USB headsets will work as well — both the speakers and the microphone — and whether this requires special applications (as with a MIDI USB device) or if they work natively with all audio apps?  <answer45222> According to this and other articles, strongyes,/strong it does work! (And it functions just like any other audio input/output device — with any application that supports audio in/out.)  <comment51460> @GraemeHutchison Oooh, good catch, thanks for reminding me!
