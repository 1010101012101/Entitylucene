WiFi Certificates Accidentally Deleted <body> I accidentally deleted some certificates from the Keychain Access application and I think they were somehow related to WiFi networks.  Now everytime I try to join a network that uses PEAP authentication, it tells me to Accept the certificate (no password to unlock).  I looked at Why does OS X repeatedly prompt for certificate trust when joining WPA2 Enterprise WiFi and added all the certificates as trusted, but that doesn't help.  Also, I suspect that this has caused my WiFi to become less reliable, i.e. my connection drops more frequently, and things like that.  How do I solve this? Any ideas welcome.  <comment305118> Try this: https://www.macissues.com/2015/09/10/fix-persistent-invalid-certificate-errors/ <comment305383> Have you solved your problem yet? Did you talk with your network admin (if you are not the person) about re-certifiing the PEAP Cert? <comment307914> No, the problem is still unsolved.  @kenjikato could you perhaps point me towards something that discusses PEAP Certificates in general? <comment308232> gunner I think there are loads of articles online, here is a [nice overview](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SCJKrg0ZdzkJ:searchnetworking.techtarget.com/answer/Can-you-help-me-understand-the-differences-between-WPA2-and-Ciscos-LEAP-security-Is-one-better-or+) to start with.
