How up-to-date are macOS command line utility df statistics? <body> (Running macOS 10.12.5)  I noticed that the disk usage statistics reported by code/bin/df/code are nearly identical when I did this:  ol lirun codedf -k/code/li lidelete ~20 GB of information/li lirun codedf -k/code again/li /ol  I thought that the trash might be a factor. The ~20 GB I deleted were VMs that I deleted through VirtualBox. I looked in the trash, but didn't see those VMs there. I emptied the trash (~8 GB) and ran codedf -k/code a third time after emptying the trash, but the numbers reported by code/bin/df/code were still nearly identical.  Are the numbers the same because the drive occasionally runs some sort of clean up, and that hasn't happened yet? If so, is there a way to force the drive to run a clean up to update the usage statistics reported by codedf/code?
