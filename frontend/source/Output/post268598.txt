Turn off emojis in mail subject line <body> I despise having emojis in the subject line of my emails (iOS and OSX); I find it an obnoxious distraction. Is there a way to turn the rendering of them off?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i30EO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment337299> Are you talking about iOS or MacOS?  In MacOS you could in theory get rid of all emoji by removing the Apple Color Emoji font.  In iOS I don't think that's possible.  In any case, no way to be selective about it. <comment337301> Yea I was referring to both. Bummer.
