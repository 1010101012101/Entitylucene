Error message trying to open rtorrent <body> I just installed rtorrent using Homebrew(on Macbook Air with Mavericks), but every time I try to open it I get the following error message :  precodedyld: Symbol not found: __ZNSt3tr18__detail12__prime_listE   Referenced from: /usr/local/lib/libtorrent.18.dylib   Expected in: /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib  in /usr/local/lib/libtorrent.18.dylib /code/pre  This is my .rtorrent.rc file :  precodedirectory = ~/Downloads/ session = ~/.session/ encryption = allow_incoming, try_outgoing, enable_retry schedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start= ~/Downloads/*.torrent schedule = untied_directory,5,5,stop_untied= schedule = tied_directory,5,5,start_tied= /code/pre  <answer144544> According to the answer from: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/24132     I ran into the same thing this week with upgrading to Mavericks. It'll fix itself if you do:   codebrew reinstall libtorrent --build-from-source/code     In this case, I think the issue is that the Mavericks bottle for libtorrent is bogus, but it's the default install.   Author: bconway  <answer226145> This happened to me when I uninstalled gcc after installing rtorrent. First, try reinstalling gcc (codebrew install gcc/code) and see if it works. This is what I did and now it works:  precodebrew uninstall rtorrent brew install gcc brew install rtorrent /code/pre  <comment223760> `brew reinstall rtorrent --build-from-source` worked for me. Probably a different problem this time around.
