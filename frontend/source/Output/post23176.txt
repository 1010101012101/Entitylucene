Config a function key to activate the [App : Show All] command <body> [my first question here...]  Is there a good way to map a function key to do the [App : Show All] command? i.e. Un-hide all apps.  BTW, i currently use Spark to map function keys.  <answer23177> Check out the Keyboard preference pane:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5f1us.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the Keyboard shortcuts tab, click the plus to add a new shortcut. Set the dropdown to "All Applications" and then type "Show All" (case sensitive!) as the menu item. Map it to whatever you like.  <comment25854> Now it becomes obvious! 8) Thank you!
