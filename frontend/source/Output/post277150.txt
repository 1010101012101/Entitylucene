Slow animation on FileVault unlock screen <body> When unlocking FileVault on my Mac, the animations are very slow. The fadeout from the user picture to the password entry is a lot slower than on the standard unlock screen, and the cursor takes a moment to appear.   When moving the mouse during the password box appearing animation, it is also very slow and leaves a trail, even though trail is disables in system preferences.  Running:br macOS Sierra 10.12.3 16D32 on:br 2016 MacBook Pro 13" w/ 4 ThunderBolt 3  It has been like this since the day it arrived, and nothing else seems to give me this peculiar problem.
