How to automatically activate VPN when iPhone is unlocked <body> Due to Verizon's recent X-UIDH/packet sniffing shenanigans, I've installed a L2TP VPN on my iPhone. I have no trouble connecting to the VPN, but I have to remember to do it every time I connect to Verizon's network/open my phone etc.   Is there a profile I can download, or some other trick I can use to have the VPN default to "on"? So it turns on when I connect to LTE or unlock my phone or some other trigger. It looks like there are some guides out there but once they started talking about plists   I was wondering if there was an easier way.
