Adding a Custom Keyboard Shortcut Command Set  Personalize your Xcode experience by adding your own set of keyboard shortcuts.

Many of these default shortcuts are based on the commonly used Emacs key bindings.  precodeIn the Key Bindings preferences pane, choose Manage Key Bindings from the Key Bindings set pop-up menu.  Click the Add button in the lower left of the dialog.  Choose Duplicate or a template option from the pop-up menu. Name your new command set file. /code/pre  You can override the default shortcuts by creating a new command set with your preferred shortcuts. This new set is stored in the folder ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/KeyBindings/ as a property list with the extension .idekeybindings.   subsource:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-keybindings_preferences/articles/AddingaCustomKeyboardShortcutCommandSet.html/sub  <comment222265> Thanks, but apart from reconfiguring the key. It would be impossible on my keyboard to execute CMD + =  (as = requires the shift key) ? <comment222266> as said, make a NEW shortcut for that function, obviously without the "=", and use something else.
