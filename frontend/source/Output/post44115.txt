I'd like to upgrade my MacBook Pro's RAM and hard drive. What brands are reliable? <body> I do heavy web development/web design and run my software on a MacBook Pro (Mid 2009) 2.8ghz model. I use Adobe products, run virtual machines in Parallels, have multiple browsers open, text editors and sometimes IDE's. That's how I typically use my machine.  I'd like to upgrade my RAM and possibly get a larger capacity hard drive, but I'm not sure what brands to buy.  From what I've read so far, it looks like Kingston HyperX KHX1600C9S3P1K2/8G is what I need. As for a hard drive I'm after something reliable. No nasty surprises a year from now.  I would really appreciate some advice as this is something I've delayed doing since I purchased my MacBook Pro.  <answer44116> I did the same to one of my old macs and opted for Crucial Memory and a Western Digital hard drive. Their still going strong and I've had absolutely no problems (and the WD drive is emreally fast/em)  <answer44127> h1OWC/h1  I buy everything from these guys. They can get RAM and hard drives for just about any Mac and it's almost always within $5 of Newegg, without having to sort through their PC crap.   They sell exclusively Apple stuff and it's easy to find what you're looking for. Usually free or less than $3-5 shipping and it's super fast (even for the free/cheap shipping).   In your question, you mentioned that you don't want any nasty surprises down the road. If you really don't, then strongemback up/em/strong. Know that every hard drive will eventually fail. Some will drop dead in a year, some will drop dead in 10 years. You just won't know until it happens, usually.   There are two best practices for avoiding catastrophic hard drive failure:  ol listrongBACK UP/strong. (can't stress this enough)/li liBuy quality hard drives from good companies. I, for instance, will not buy a hard drive from anyone but strongHitachi/strong. OWC sells hitachi hard drives. They're a little more expensive, but I've never had one die on me. That being said, I still strongback up/strong./li /ol  <comment50130> Hardware recommendations are off topic, per the [FAQ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#questions). <comment50132> Â£34.79 for crucials.. didn't expect the pack to be so cheap. If you was running a mbp do you remember the maximum sized harddrive it could take? <comment50133> I do have a mbp, and I put a 500gb hard drive in, but I don't see why it couldn't go up to at least 750 (I'm not sure there is a limit, provided the connectors are right). <comment50135> Some hardware recommendations are on-topic. http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1009/refining-policy-on-hardware-recommendations <comment50151> I disagree, this question forces *subjectivity* and  *unspecific answers*. By what standards do we measure *reliable*? <comment50181> I've lost quite important data in the past as well as a large music collection I spent a long time recording from vinyl onto my system and arranging into folders. Ever since then I've tried to avoid western digital drives even though many people recommend them. I always have time machine enabled as I can't take any chances this time round. I'll check out OWC thanks. <comment50198> Good call. Yeah, I won't ever buy a Seagate or WD hard drive. They're awful. Good luck. <comment50227> Second vote for Crucial when picking RAM, and WD has always been good with hard drives. <comment50228> NewEgg have Mac section now for a lot of components. Not that OWC aren't good - just saying it's there if you want to look.
