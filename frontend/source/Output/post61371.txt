Mail shows stale inbox count <body> I've had some odd behavior on my OS X mail client. Heres' my inbox:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/glH5X.png" alt="enter image description here"  Yet here is how many unread messages I have:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3lhFL.png" alt="enter image description here"  These values used to be synchronized. Note that the first value will not change even if I mark all other messages as read (subfolders included).   OS X 10.7.4br Mail = Version 5.2 (1278)  <answer61384> Try these two solutions:  ol liFrom the Finder, ⌥-click the Go menu and select Library whilst still holding ⌥./li liMove the folder code~/Library/Mail//code to the desktop or another convenient location./li liLaunch Mail.app./li liFrom the File Menu choose Import Mailboxes…/li liChoose Import Data from Apple Mail./li liNavigate to ~/Desktop or wherever you moved code~/Library/Mail//code to./li liClick on Choose./li liWait until it imports./li /ol  emor/em  ol liIn a Finder window, navigate to code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/code, and delete any file that begins with Envelope Index, such as "Envelope Index" or "Envelope Index-shm" or "Envelope Index – awl". In my case, I had all 3 of these Envelope indexes, and moved them to the trash.  emNote:/em When accessing Library, keep in mind that your home Library is hidden in Lion.  To access it, from the Finder, ⌥-click the Go menu and select Library whilst still holding ⌥./li liRestart Mail. It will then rebuild a new list of messages, which can take some time, so be patient.  emAnother note for Exchange users:/em After removing the Envelope Indexes, my Exchange account email content was blank. To revive it, I had to delete my Exchange email account and add it again fresh.  After adding it from scratch (and the download took a while since I have about 12K messages), the mystery Unread Message notifications were gone./li /ol  <comment70838> What type of mail account is this? IMAP, POP, Exchange? <comment70854> Oh yes, it's Exchange - thanks for the clarification q. <comment70856> Is the value of unread mail proper in OWA? <comment70866> Damn. Pulled the trigger on the second option without reading all of your response. I have 60k messages coming my way... Update to come. <comment70914> This looks similar to an issue I had a while back: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21122/mail-app-on-lion-with-exchange-doesnt-get-updates
