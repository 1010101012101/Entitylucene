How to add a line break in a cell in Excel for Mac <body> What key combination do I have to press to create a line break in a cell in Excel for Mac 2011? The Windows combination of kbdAlt/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd does not work on the Mac.  <answer84610> The answer is to use kbdControl/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd, which will create a line break in the cell.  As an alternative, kbdControl/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd can also be used to achieve the same.  These combinations work both in Excel for Mac 2011 and the new Excel for Mac 2015.  As pointed out by Shameer in this answer, kbdAlt/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd now seems to work as well in the new Excel for Mac 2015.  <answer100417> The kbd⌥ alt/kbd key is also the kbd⌥ option/kbd key on a Mac keyboard.br Hence, kbd⌃ control/kbd+kbdoption ⌥/kbd+kbd↩ return/kbd works too.  <answer123536> kbdControl/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdenter/kbd   or  kbdCommand/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdenter/kbd  <answer126291> kbdfn/kbd + kbd⌃/kbd + kbd⌥/kbd + kbd↩/kbd.  The kbdfn/kbd causes the option key to become the alt key.  <answer142073> http://giffconstable.com/2013/10/mac-excel-keyboard-shortcuts/ helped me figure it out - it turns out to be ctrl-i worked on my macbook  <answer143473> kbdctrl ⌃/kbd + kbdcommand ⌘/kbd + kbdreturn ↩/kbd at the same time.  <answer182881> All was wrong.  Fn + Shift + Enter is the right combination .  <answer182934> In Microsoft Excel for Mac (Preview)  kbdctrl ^/kbd + kbdU/kbd  or  kbdfn/kbd + kbdF2/kbd  <answer191936> Use kbdAlt/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd. It should solve your problem.  <answer206102> None of these seems to work.  Have tried all.  I am using a keyboard to interface to the Mac.  I am using Office 365.  EDIT: Weirdly if I used fn+f2 to get the curser in the cell, fn+alt+cmd+return then worked...  <comment147895> there is already a accepted answer here, so what is it you are trying to do ? <comment147899> FN does not cause option to become alt — option and alt is the same thing. <comment157444> You *do* need the FN key. <comment169000> I tried this in Excel for Mac 2011, and it works. <comment219411> Doesn't work for me. <comment219413> These don't add a line break in a call, they switch to edit mode in the cell, allowing to type text in the cell. <comment228125> This seems to be a new addition in Excel for Mac 2015 (Preview) - it didn't work in Excel for Mac 2011. <comment228224> This does NOT work for me on the Mac. I'd downvote, but rep is too low on this SE property. <comment351068> Alt+Enter works for Windows as well. Tanks.
