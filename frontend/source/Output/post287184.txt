Can I get a Canon scanner driver from Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) to work on 10.12 Sierra? <body> I have recently updatet to macOS 10.12 Sierra. With this, my scanner Canon CanoScan LiDE 70 does not work anymore. Latest supported macOS on Canon site is Mac OS 10.7 Lion, Ver. 12.13.3 from August 2011:  http://www.canon-europe.com/support/consumer_products/products/scanners/lide_series/canoscan_lide_70.aspx?type=drivers&amp;language=EN&amp;os=Mac%20OS%20X%2010.7%20(Lion)  I have installed this driver in Sierra without error messages (reboot was required), but the scanner still does not show up. Did not expect it to be that easy, anyway.  I know in Windows there is sometimes the possibility to edit a .inf file in the driver package to make the driver run on a system it was not designed to run.  Is there anything I can try to make the Canon CanoScan LiDE 70 run on Sierra?  Thanks,  <comment362560> As this is not technically an answer, but in case no one has a trick... There is always the excellent VueScan (https://www.hamrick.com/) Works with a *LOT* of older scanners. No relation to the developer, but I have used it and it is excellent. <comment366605> @SteveChambers Thanks for the information, I did try VueScan, it claims it supports Canon Lide 70, but the scanner was not found by this tool either (I installed Lion driver as required). Well, I guess there is no solution, have to buy new scanner.
