How can I fix my built in Mac Screen Sharing App? <body> Screen sharing through the app has been shoddy at best for me since updating.  I thought I had it figured out and now its not working this week.  My device on the same network is a linux machine and connecting to it from ssh works fine (always has).  But for whatever reason the screen sharing functionality is Broken.  I’ve tried to connect to server using vnc://x.x.x.x  or smb://x.x.x.x as well as without the slashes.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GFz9.png" alt="This Usually Works"  I’ve tried to connect using the Screen sharing app as well.  There is a weird 3rd option that sees my computer but it NEVER works to connect to it.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ts2Fy.png" alt="This Never works"  So Far I’ve tried to restart the machines and this:  http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/if-your-screen-sharing-stops-working-read-this.441030/  Summary says:   ol liLaunch the Activity Monitor program./li liIn the Process Name list, look for "NetAuthAgent". It may show as "Not Responding"./li liSelect NetAuthAgent, and then click Quit Process (the red stop sign button at the top of the Activity Monitor window). Then, click Force Quit./li /ol  Your Screen Sharing should now work.  But that is from 2008 so I know there’s no way that they didn’t fix that by now.   strongBottom Line:/strong How can I fix screen sharing to this other device, for Good?    <answer234699> On your Linux computer you will need a to run a VNC server of some sort.  There may be one already installed that you need to start. How to do this depends on the Linux distro you have. Try codeman vncserver/code at the command line on the Linux box and see what you get.  VNC is a screen sharing protocol and SMB is a file sharing protocol so you can't get screen sharing using SMB.  <comment286976> ah, thanks for explaining that.  I've got one, its built in  (mint Linux) but it seems to work inconsistently, yet I can login flawlessly with ssh between restarts.  If I could somehow start the vnc server via ssh that would be ideal <comment287730> Well you should be able to do that. You just need to know *what* the VNC server software is and it should be easy to start it from the shell after you ssh in.  I suggest you ask your question in the Linux area of Stack Exchange - "How do I restart the VNC server from shell?"
