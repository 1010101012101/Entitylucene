How do I input ^ instead of ˆ <body> In my iMac 21.5-inch computer (OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.1) I have a cordless keyboard.  At the top of the key kbd6/kbd I have kbdˆ/kbd instead of kbd^/kbd.  This is a problem. I never have needed to use kbdˆ/kbd, however kbd^/kbd I need to use it very often. For example, formatting formulas at Math Stack Exchange with emMathJax/em.  Therefore I need to look it up in the Internet.  Is there a special shortcut for having an input of kbd^/kbd? Or is there a way to change my keyboard inputs?  <answer234353> You can find the combinations to many more symbols by opening "Keyboard Viewer".   The combinations in here should reflect your current keyboard layout as specified under codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard/code.  To open Keyboard Viewer, click the menubar keyboard icon (if you don't have it, it's enable it from codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard/code) and select "Show Keyboard Viewer".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8iEtm.png"  I suggest pressing kbdOption/kbd or kbdShift/kbd or kbdOption/kbd+kbdShift/kbd to modify the keyboard input under Keyboard Viewer.  <answer234357> You need to go to Keyboard Preferences and add a new keyboard.  Instead of using emUSA International keyboard/em you will need to use USA Keyboard.  So from  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGvvF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Use instead  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vj9DA.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol liWhen you are going to add a Keyboard you select English./li liAt the end of the list you will see both keyboards. Use the one that is not international./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSnNB.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Another option is to put the ˆ and before you press another key, press the space bar.  <answer284369> Try pressing kbdAlt/kbd + kbdI/kbd That's an 'i', not a lowercase L  'l' or '1'. If that doesn't work, switch to a new keyboard.  <comment286511> Does Shift+6 not bring up `^`? <comment286513> @perhapsmaybeharry No. It brings me up ˆ. But in the keyboard it has the figure you say. <comment286514> That's really weird. What keyboard format do you use? <comment286517> 1. I get [this](http://i.imgur.com/bQLnJ0M.png) where you told me to go. 2. [I can't do *replacement of shortcuts* that have less than 2 characters](http://i.imgur.com/C1q0C5T.png). <comment286519> @perhapsmaybeharry What do you mean? I use [this keyboard](http://i.imgur.com/Gvthacu.png), if it is what you are asking. <comment286520> For point 1, look under the first tab, last option, for two, good point. I suggest looking at keyboard viewer to identify where `^` actually is. I must've overlooked the two-character minumum <comment286521> Oh! I resolved it. It was changing from English International Keyboard to English keyboard. I guess I answer my own question? <comment286522> Sure. I just went and looked under "English International - PC" and I understand why it didn't work.
