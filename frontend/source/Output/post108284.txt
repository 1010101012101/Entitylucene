How can I plug FileMerge into my Source Control App <body> I'd like to use FileMerge (Version 2.8) as Git and Perforce's Diff viewer, however whenever one of these apps tries to do a diff I get this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vw0Fb.png" alt="FileMerge Error"  This isn't just for Groovy files either,it's for any type of file I try to run a diff against.  This is happening on systems running 10.9 and 10.8.    This is how I have it configured in Perforce:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M36Eh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer108290> The issue is that you are setting an app bundle in the config when the version control program is expecing a Unix command line.  You should use /usr/bin/opendiff as the command line. I think that is the only chnage you need for the perforce diff you show.  Example git configs for merging are in this  question and several other duplicates on StackOverflow.  <comment126969> The SourceControl clients are calling it directly and passing the files to FileMerge as arguments. I'll append another photo of the config to my original question. <comment126972> @Mark I just posed a screenshot of my P4 config to the original question.
