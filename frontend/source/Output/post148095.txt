If that doesn't work, try downloading the combo update from here:  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1760  You may find that this works where downloading from the App Store fails.  <comment174551> Where did you download the upgrade from? <comment174552> I am connected to my wifi network and i am trying the update from the apple store <comment174630> Also the same result ! it maybe connection problem ? really I am confused :/ <comment174633> Or it maybe because the version of this iMac it seems somehow old so its not supported with new updates ? <comment174709> This could be a connection problem. If you can use an Ethernet connection, that may improve the situation for you.
