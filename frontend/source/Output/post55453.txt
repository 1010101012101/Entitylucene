iPhone 4S not syncing with my Google calendars <body> I just purchased an iPhone 4S and I am using iOS 5.1.1. Only one of my Google calendars is syncing. I've searched the web and have tried every suggestion, nothing is solving the problem.  <answer55456> You'll need to make sure that your account is properly configured in Settings  Mail, Contacts, and Calendars.  Since you're using Gmail, make sure that Calendars are set to ON and then go to the Calendar app and make sure all the calendars are selected to be displayed by tapping "Calendars" in the top left corner and checking off all the calendars you want to see from your Gmail account.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a9p8P.png" alt="Screenshot, turn Calendars ON after adding your Gmail account to Mail, Contacts, Calendars"  <answer55463> That's the google recommended way http://support.google.com/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=139206  <answer105201> Maybe you have only enabled CalDAV syncing for the one calendar that works?
