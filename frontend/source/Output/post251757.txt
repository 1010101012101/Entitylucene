Parallels 12 - Hypervisor: Parallels or Apple? <body> The new version 12 of Parallels Desktop For Mac has a new configuration option. In the configuration panel  Hardware  CPU &amp; Memory  Advanced Settings  codeHypervisor/code is a popup menu for:  ul liHypervisor  ul liParallels/li liApple/li /ul/li /ul  Which one do I should I be using when running macOS Sierra as the guest OS?  What exactly is the difference, the pros-and-cons of each?  The Parallels app emHelp/em has no mention of this new setting.  <answer256091> This post in Parallels Forum clearly states to use Parallels Hypervisor:     Hi, Apple hypervisor comes short of the following matters comparing to the Parallels hypervisor:      ul   liPerformance: slower on VM startup and shutdown/li   liStability: may crash more frequently/li   liFunctionality loss: no PMU, nested virtualization, thermal monitoring, energy profiling/li   /ul      Parallels Hypervisor is the best one.   By emPaulChris@Parallels/em, a Parallels Support person.  <answer259376> The Apple Hypervisor is a user-centric emlightweight/em hypervisor that Apple provides so developers don't have to write kernel extensions (KEXTs).  From everything that I have gathered, this is primarily for a dev environment   From the Hypervisor documentation on Apple Developer:     The Hypervisor framework provides C APIs for interacting with   virtualization technologies in user-space, without the need for   writing kernel extensions (KEXTs). As a result, apps created using   this framework are suitable for distribution on the Mac App Store.   The Parallels Hypervisor is a more robust Hypervisor that isn't "user centric."  Meaning that it can be invoked at the OS level, not just at the user level.  You also get much more robust features like the emAdaptive Hypervisor Technology/em that allows you to allocate CPU resources across the host and guest VM's  My take...  If you are looking to run a Window 10 VM for testing or a specific app, then either Hypervisor will probably work just fine.  If you are looking to load up a Linux host for dev work that you want accessible whether or not you are at your machine, you probably want the Parallels Hypervisor.  <answer282057> From my own experience on a retina Macbook Pro 15' 2015 An idling Windows 10 VM running VS 2015 on VMWare Fusion is around 100% CPU the same on Parallels Hypervisor is around 50~60 with Apple Hypervisor, it's about 20%.   Crashes and lockups happen more or less as frequently whatever vm software or hypervisor I use.  You should try either setting and check what fits better for your use.   <comment319252> Does it say why? Please avoid posting (basically) link-only answers as the idea of an answer is to explain the "why" - and "how", if necessary - behind why your answer is correct. <comment319650> As Tubedogg says, you should quote or summarize content linked in an Answer. Also, that linked post claims the Apple hypervisor is slower to startup/shutdown, crashes more, and lacks features such as power & thermal monitoring. No citations, no explanations, no upsides mentioned. Why would the Parallels team add support for the Apple hypervisor if it is so lame?
