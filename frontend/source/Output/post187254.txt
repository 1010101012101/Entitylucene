sudo asking for password even though user doesn't have a password set <body> I have a computer that doesn't not require a password. I'd like this to continue into codesudo/code, but unfortunately it doesn't recognise a user not having a password.  According to Apple the codesudo/code command requires a non-blank password: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202035  Is there some way I can easily override this so I can have a blank password with codesudo/code? It's only ever a hindrance and security on this machine is not an issue. Thanks.  <answer187257> I found an answer that works perfectly (although it requires temporarily adding a password to your user first):  ol liOpen the Terminal  Type: codesudo visudo/code  Enter your user's password (create one if necessary)./li liChange this line FROM:  code%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL/code  TO:  code%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/code  (press 'i' to enter insert mode if you can't edit the text)/li liWrite and Quit  code:wq/code  (press 'esc' first to enter command mode)/li /ol  <comment221380> Just a note. If you need to enter many commands which require the sudo prefix, enter `sudo sh` first. This will leave you logged in as the root user until you enter the `exit` command. As root user, the `sudo` prefix is implicit.
