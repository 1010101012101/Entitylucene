File Open dialog freezing on macOS 10.12 <body> I recently updated my macbook pro to macos 10.12. After I'm facing a lot of problems with file access.  ol liWhenever I try to save or open a file, the "File Open" dialog comes after 30-60 seconds. Till then I'll not able to do anything on the application. But other apps work fine./li liFile-Open Recent is also taking the same amount of time. I've no option other than waiting for it load./li liWhenever I try to drag and drop a file it is not easier. As mentioned even this takes same time./li /ol  I think the above problems are associated with a common issue in the OS. Please let me know if you have any solutions.  <answer267616> The issue seems to be associated with iCloud drive. Here are two steps to resolve.  ol liI seem to have resolved the freezing dialog box problem by disabling iCloud Drive. I have been experiencing what seem to be exactly the same problems, even after two fresh Sierra installs. /li liIf you don't want to disable iCloud drive, use Finder- Preferences- Sidebar- Disable iCloud drive to  remove the iCloud option on the Finder sidebar./li /ol  <comment328265> What program are you using? My imac has the same problem,which finally turned to be folder privilege issue <comment328267> My issue is with all applications. When I try saving a web page, downloading a file, the file open dialog freezes. It is with every application. <comment328269> Better have a screen capture of folder info(Sharing&permission Part) of the folder(Users/Your currentuser folder). <comment335827> Thanks buddy. This solved my problem.
