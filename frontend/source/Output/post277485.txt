Show Library folder for an external drive <body> I would like to show the Library folder in Finder for a drive on a remote computer. I know I can open the view options for my local machines user folder and select 'Show Library Folder', but I can not do this for a remote machine.  codexattr -l Library/code print codexattr: Library: No such xattr: com.apple.FinderInfo/code.  codexattr -c Library/code does not change the attributes. Even with sudo.  The man page for codechflags/code says: 'You can use "ls -lO" to see the flags of existing files.' Which revealed that Library has the 'hidden' flag. However, code[sudo] chflags nohidden Library/code still did not change the hidden flag!
