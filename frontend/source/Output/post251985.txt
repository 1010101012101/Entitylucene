Fixing a 0xc0000225 error in VMware Fusion <body> A few days ago I had to force shut down my iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2012) running 10.11.6 because it wouldn't wake up. VMware Fusion 6.0.6 was running.   Now when I start VMware Fusion I get in this endless loop of error messages:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KrAl9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried to look for solutions online but they were all for actual installs of Windows, not installs through a virtual machine.  How can this be fixed (ideally, without losing any informations on the Windows system?)  <comment313389> Aside for the fact that VMware Fusion 6.0.6 [is not supported under OS X 10.11](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2088571), VMware has its own Support Site and Discussions Community which may be a better place then here, since the issue is so specific to Windows and VMware Fusion. <comment313391> True. I am currently looking for the customer number to log on their site and ask them... might take a while. It's not officially supported under 10.11 but ran quite well until last week ;) <comment313445> Please post the content of the vmx file to pastebin, github or a file hoster <comment313589> @klanomathcould you tell me how to do it?
