How can I put my music on dropbox without moving the iTunes folder <body> I want to copy just my music (not films/tv/etc, so I cant just move the iTunes folder) on to dropbox, so I can listen to it from anywhere for free, but without copying the music as my hard drive space is becoming limited and I don't want to have to recopy everything, everytime I add a new track).  Is there anyway to make Dropbox include the music folder inside the Dropbox folder? If you create a shortcut in the dropbox folder it will just sync the shortcut itself, can I make the shortcut actually be the music folder?  <answer43970> The easiest way to this would be to simply create a folder in DropBox and then create a Symbolic Link to your Music only folder in iTunes.  There is a useful article on symlinks available here. Another one specific to DropBox is available here.  In example you could create a symbolic link to a folder named Music in DropBox as follows:     ln -s ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/Music ~/DropBox/Music   <answer43971> Why not physically move the folder in Finder into your dropbox (so instead of Music  iTunes Music you have Dropbox  iTunes Music) and then change the directory of your library (through iTunes  Preferences) to be in the right place?   No duplicates, music synced, all happy?  <comment49966> As I understand, Dropbox doesn't follow symlinks? <comment49967> Because if I change the directory of the library then dropbox will sync TV and Movies which will put me over the 2GB dropbox limit. <comment49970> @iampearce Actually Dropbox has been designed to follow them: http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=13431 <comment49973> I stand corrected. Good call. <comment49975> In which case, the symlink option Diago posted would be your best solution. <comment49976> Can you please summarize the link so that all the important information is in your answer? Links have a tendency to degrade and disappear over time, so it is more helpful to put all the information into your answer. Thanks!! <comment209801> You could use Dropbox's Selective Sync feature to exclude the TV and Movies folders from being uploaded by Dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/175 <comment227722> Dropbox indeed follows the link and uploads all music from /Music without filling up /Dropbox/Music, HOWEVER each synced file was consequently also deleted from /Music. Fortunately all music was successfully uploaded and I could retrieve it. Not a fail proof method.
