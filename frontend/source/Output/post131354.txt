There was a problem connecting to the Server <body> Whenever iPhoto or iMovie are running I get this message  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHeg2.png" alt="enter image description here"  I did recently add some photos directly from my NAS to iPhoto, does this mean I can now only use iPhoto when I'm on my home network?  Surely I am able to have photos in iPhoto that are not physically on my laptop, I don't have that much storage  <comment154279> so it just doesn't start up if you click "ok"?
