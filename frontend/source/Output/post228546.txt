How to disable horizontal scrolling on OS X Yosemite's Preview? <body> As stated in the question, how do I disable horizontal scrolling on Preview when the page obviously fits and there is over horizontal overflow?  I am scrolling with my touchpad, and with two-finger scroll I inevitably move a little sideways while scrolling. This little jerk to the left/right is rather annoying to me and I would like to know if there are any ways to prevent the horizontal scrolling.  <comment278678> There are many builds of Yosemite. If you open the terminal app and type `sw_vers` what version and build are you running? <comment278686> ProductName: Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.11.3 BuildVersion: 15D21
