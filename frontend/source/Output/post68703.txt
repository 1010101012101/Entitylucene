Recovering lost text messages on iPhone <body> I have just realized that a sync is not a backup. I synced my phone days ago, but backed it up months ago.  Is there anyway to get my synced text message history back?    There was some really important info on there.  <answer68724> I don't know if this Data recovery for iTunes is what you are looking for but you could give it a try! You could also try Dr.Fone  <answer128393> Similar to Stephen, I don't know if this app can handle data recovery - i.e. if the phone has been zapped, but it's fantastic at offloading messages, voice and text, and any other data. I've used it during app development to check data structures.  (http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/)  <comment150369> They now have a free product too called iBrowse
