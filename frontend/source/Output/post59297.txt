What does it mean when an iMessage doesn't say "Delivered" nor "Not Delivered"? <body> I sent an iMessage to a friend, and at the bottom it doesn't say "Delivered" as it usually does. It doesn't say "Not Delivered" either, it just doesn't say anything at all.  What does it mean when an iMessage doesn't say "Delivered" nor "Not Delivered"?  <answer59298> The receiving device is probably off, in sleep mode, out of cell reception, flat battery - something like that.  <answer70525> I believe "Not Delivered" implies an error of some kind, whereas if nothing is displayed that just means the message is queued up to an inactive phone, or backed-up in transit over the network.  <answer83574> From my understanding, when your message says delivered under it then the person received it.  If the word "delivered" dont show it means they are on the phone and it will say delivered once they hang up.    <answer91063> When it doesn't say Delivered, it means the other person is texting someone else or on the phone.  Once they stop texting or hang up the phone, you will see the text message has been delivered.  <answer94419> It means that the message was not sent to their phone.  To resolve try the following   ol liin-activate the app/li liturn your phone off /li liturn wifi off then on/li liIf none of this works contact your mobile provider or Apple/li /ol  <answer97913> When It says delivered that means it has send and when it doesn't say delivered that means that either you haven't go wifi or their battery is dead so the message hasn't gone through I think     <answer110897> It can mean you have been blocked. I attempted this with my number. I blocked my number send a text, didn't receive it and it never said delivered. I unblocked my number, sent text and it worked as it should by putting delivered under text and me receiving the text.  <answer111688> It could mean that they are in area with no cellular service, or they could have blocked you â€“accidentally or otherwise, or their phone might be flat or off. I texted my friend and it didn't send; it never said delivered but when I text some other friends it sends.  <answer118796> My friend and I tested it and when someone has their phone off it will not report "delivered" or "not delivered" until the phone is turned on. I hope that helps because I was having the same problem   <answer121098> It can also mean that the other individual has simply logged out of their account  <answer125155> If it doesn't say "delivered" within an hour or 2- u were blocked. No one is texting straight thru 2 hours or on the phone more than 2 hours. And I know personally that if I get text while on phone it still says delivered. Some peeps have there's said to "read" n others don't but "delivered" is blocked if never shows up. U can call n won't go straight vm but iMessage/text message will always confirm delivery  <answer131970> It can mean a few things;  ul liThe recipients' phone battery is low/dead/li liThe recipients' phone is out of wifi range./li liThe recipient has you on block/li liThe recipients' phone is off/li /ul  <comment81839> I have the same problem it's not sending to one person I don't know why <comment146466> What others said was incorrect. Even if you are blocked by another phone, your messages will still say delivered. Blocking a person gives them no clue as to whether or not they are blocked. It will say delivered and nothing more.
