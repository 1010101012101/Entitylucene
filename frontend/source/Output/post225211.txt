Podcasts showing twice in the "My Podcasts tab" on iTunes <body> In the "My Podcasts" tab, almost every podcast of mine is appearing twice at the left column like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDMWj.png" alt=""  However, in the codeEpisode List/code display mode, everything is just fine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OEsiI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way I can get it fixed for the codePodcasts/code display mode so that every podcast only shows up once?   For the record I'm using 12.3.2 (the latest version).  <answer225329> A day later it managed to fix itself. Looks like the problem may be caused by some cache that is cleared when reboot.
