.afpDeleted* files, who's making them? <body> When I use codels/code, I get the following message.     ls: .afpDeleted38045157: No such file or directory   My codesvn/code fails in this directory with     svn: E070008: Can't read directory 'current path': Partial results are valid but processing is incomplete    Apparently, these .afpDeleted files are some form of deleted files that are still open according to http://lists.apple.com/archives/macos-x-server/2004/Jun/msg01271.html  How do I know which program generated this file? I can't even access what's in the file, nor can I remove it arbitrarily.  I'm using Mac OS 10.8.4.  EDIT: After killing several suspected processes, I found out it was my MATLAB. I still want to understand more about this afpDeleted* business though.  <answer221481> In the 2004 words of Leland Wallace, an Apple employee in the Core Servers group:     There is a unix programming "pattern" of creating a temp file, opening   it, then deleting it, keeping it open. This allows the application to   have a private scratch file that cannot be accessed by any other   process (the file will to be completely deleted when it is closed).   AFP does not have direct support for "open-delete" so we need to fake   it by renaming the "deleted" file to .afpDeletedXXX and deferring the   delete until it is closed.
