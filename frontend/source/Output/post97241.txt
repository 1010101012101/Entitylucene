ls command: What does the @ in file mode mean, and how to get rid of it? <body> After I download files on OSX and then want to use them, they often have an @ appended on the file mode whenever I do a codels -l/code. Here is an example output, see the code@/code near the beginning of the line:  precodels -l *.php -rw-r--r--@ 1 username  staff  11179 Dec 17  2010 class.mysql.php -rw-r--r--@ 1 username  staff     24 Nov  1  2010 info.php -rw-r--r--@ 1 username  staff     61 Dec 23  2010 page.php -rw-r--r--@ 1 username  staff   1157 Dec 17  2010 photo.php /code/pre  I think it is some kind of locking meganism, is that right? And how do I get rid of it?  <answer97242> From the codels/code manual (codeman ls/code) section emThe Long Format/em     codeIf the file or directory has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '@' character./code   You can then display the extended attributes with code-@/code     code-@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output./code   To manipulate extended attributes you can use the codexattr/code command. See for example emHow do I remove the extended attributes in Mac OS X/em or emDealing With Extended Attributes on OS X/em  <comment114076> Thank you, very complete answer! I was just about to ask how to remove any attributes, but I see you have just updated your post :) <comment114077> I just realized later that there was a second part in the question :-)
