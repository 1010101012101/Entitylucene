New iPad Pro lightning cable male end spliced to female end of 4wire OTG cable? <body> I'm trying to reporpose my iPad Pro lightning cable and (originally) android USB host cable.  This lightning cable once opened up has an odd config... red, white, green wires then 4 more what appear to be like earbud audio wiring, that cottony crap that you have to burn a little to expose the connection. Of course the OTG cable is the standard red, white, green and black.    My goal is splicing the lightning male end (with wires) to the OTG female end and I need some guidance on which wire splices with which wire... if that makes any sense.  Can you help?   <comment364147> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is outside the scope of this site. <comment364164> What are you trying to accomplish here, what exactly will be the purpose of the cable afterwards?
