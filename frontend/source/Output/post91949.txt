Remap arrow key to different shortcut <body> I am used to vim and like to move with kbdH/kbd, kbdJ/kbd, kbdK/kbd, kbdL/kbd. I would like to avoid switching to the arrow keys when I am in a text field for example.  Is there a way to remap the following keys in all application on strongMac OS X/strong, so that:  kbd&larr;/kbd can also be triggered by kbdOPTION/kbd kbdH/kbd  kbd&darr;/kbd can also be triggered by kbdOPTION/kbd kbdJ/kbd  kbd&uarr;/kbd can also be triggered by kbdOPTION/kbd kbdK/kbd  kbd&rarr;/kbd can also be triggered by kbdOPTION/kbd kbdL/kbd  <answer91950> You can use KeyRemap4MacBook to remap keys.     A powerful and stable keyboard customizer for OS X.   This page details how to add custom behaviors.  <comment205922> Can anyone please share the relevant config to get this done?
