Unable to locate an executable at "/usr/bin/java/bin/java" <body> I am having an issue with Java in my Mac (OS X 10.7.3). Previously I installed it and it was working fine. After some changes in the .bash_profile and .profile file in the course of time, I am having an error like codeUnable to locate an executable at "/usr/bin/java/bin/java"/code whenever I try to run "javac" or "java" in my terminal.  codeecho $PATH/code gives an output like:  precode/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/Users/sabya/Documents/Play_Framework/play-2.0:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin /code/pre  My .bash_profile looks like:  precodealias start_mysql="/Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM start" alias stop_mysql="/Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM stop" export JAVA_HOME=/usr/bin/java /code/pre  Its bugging me for several days and reinstalling Java did not help. I'm a newbie in Mac and need help to sort out this issue. I Googled before posting this question but did not find anything relevant.  <answer52788> You probably can just remove the definition of JAVA_HOME from code.bash_profile/code and restart the shell. If you really need to set the variable, use  precodeexport JAVA_HOME=$(/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/Commands/java_home) /code/pre  to define it dynamically depending on the installed JDK version or  precodeexport JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home /code/pre  to use the default place (which is symlinked to the above path).  <comment60380> Another trick worked . I just edited the .bash_profile and exported the JAVA_HOME as export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home . It solved the problem . <comment60403> Indeed :-) It's a symbolic link leading (after some more redirections) to the same place. I've extended the answer accordingly. <comment60551> Frequently you do not even need JAVA_HOME
