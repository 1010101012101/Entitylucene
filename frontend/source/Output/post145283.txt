How to sync one or two labels only, from Gmail to Mail.app? <body> As many are facing the problem of IMAP syncing all the mails of Gmail, I want to know how can one sync specific Gmail labels to Mail.app?  For example, if I have Friends, Family, Company1, Company2, and Bank labels, how can I only synchronize Friends and Family?  Also, It should not apply that setting uniformly to all my syncs. For example, I want to sync all my mails to my Nexus 5, but only few labels with Mail.app.  <answer145286> You can specify the labels shown in your IMAP client in Google Mail settings via the checkbox on the right side.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oY5O9.png" alt="GMail settings"  <comment171207> I have updated my question following your answer.
