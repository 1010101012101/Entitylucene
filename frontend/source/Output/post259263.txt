Purgeable space on my Mac takes up far more space than my iCloud space... how does this happen? <body> According to the Interwebs, the purgeable space is stuff stored on iCloud. Is this 22GB of space something else as well? The only thing I can imagine is music on iTunes, but the .m4p files on Apple Music seem to take up only 500MB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XRXKC.png" alt="hard drive space"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j3N90.png" alt="iCloud space"  <comment324327> It's not actively stored on iCloud unless you told it to. Also, that space contains cache files, etc.
