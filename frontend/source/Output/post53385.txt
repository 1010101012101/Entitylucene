How can I tell Firewall to allow incoming connections for Python running a specific script? (In this case: SickBeard) <body> I'm running SickBeard on my Lion installation, but I can't figure out how which Python version or script I should add to the Firewall rules allow connections from outside. In Console I get this message:  precodeDeny Python connecting from &lt;&lt;external-ip:port&gt;&gt; to port &lt;&lt;my-port&gt;&gt; proto=6 /code/pre  So for now I've had to disable my entire firewall to allow for external control, but I'd much rather just allow Python to be connected to. I'm running Python 2.7.3 and I have already allowed the following applications to the firewall â€” to no avail:  ul li/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7/li li/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/li li/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python/li li/usr/bin/python/li /ul  Any suggestions?  <answer53386> While checking the programs above I realized I hadn't added the Current alias, which was  likely used:  ul li/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/Python/li /ul  Adding Python from the Current alias folder fixed my problem. Hadn't seen this question or answer anywhere else online so I'm keeping it up.
