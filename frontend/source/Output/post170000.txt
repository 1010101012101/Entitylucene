How to completely remove Nix package manager? <body> I installed Nix package manager, and now I would like to remove it completely.  How can I do it?  <answer175407> I asked myself the same question and searched the file system for Nix-related files. That's what I found:  precode# as user, remove: rm -r ~/.nix-channels ~/.nix-defexpr ~/.nix-profile # as root (sudo), remove: sudo rm -r /nix # edit the file ~/.profile and remove the line containing "added by Nix installer" /code/pre  Not sure if I missed some files or directories. Also, I did not remove it myself, so be careful (and backup your data!) when removing stuff with sudo.  <comment199779> http://osxdaily.com/2014/07/31/manual-complete-app-removal-mac-os-x-terminal/
