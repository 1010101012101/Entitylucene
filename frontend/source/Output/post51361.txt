Where is Diagnostics & Usage Data stored on iOS? <body> Since I've installed a few jailbreak tweaks, my iPhone has been crashing fairly regularly and I would like to know exactly what's causing it.  Does anyone know the direct path to where the crash logs/reports are stored on the device (code/var/mobile//code, for example)? This way I can clear all current logs, to start afresh, and I can extract them for viewing on a bigger screen, etc. Or does anyone know of a more advanced way to interact with and analyse the iPhone's Diagnostics &amp; Usage data, in general?  Thanks  <answer51362> Crash Reporter is a convenient tool for viewing recent crash reports on a jailbroken device - it's a free package hosted by BigBoss repository.  You can also view your syslog on the device by installing codesyslog &gt; /var/log/syslog/code (a free package hosted by Cydia/Telesphoreo repository), rebooting your device, and then using your favorite tool to view it at the command line (see here for slightly more detailed instructions). The codesyslog/code records where each crash report is saved.  <answer51432> The official logs and crash logs in on the path code/var/mobile/Library/Logs/code.  You can also download codesyslog/code. And get his logs from code/var/syslog/code  <comment58717> Is there nothing for the desktop? It would be preferable and more convenient if I could interact with the reports from the desktop. Bigger screen, windows, and all that.. Or do I use the syslogs to find where they are and then extract them to the desktop? <comment58781> I would suggest copying your syslog to your desktop and then also copying the crash reports too. OpenSSH on the device + a desktop SFTP client (like Transmit or Cyberduck) can make this easier. <comment58782> Yes, I know that. But, as I said in my question, I need to path to the reports and logs.
