Is it possible to compose Mac OS Mail in an external editor? <body> For Thunderbird there is the External Editor extension a very very classical piece of software that, when called via a shortcut, pops up your external editor (emacs in my case) and let's you edit your mail there.  While editing the compose window of Thunderbird is blocked.  When the external editor closes, the compose window is populated with the updated text of the mail.  Very convenient to have your mail as one buffer in your emacs, for instance to edit tables, copy computational results, use power editing features like regexp-search-and-replace, etc.  My question: Is it possible to implement the same thing using Mac OS Mail + AppleScript or other tricks?  <comment222077> Though it’s a more generalized solution, [this answer to a similar Q](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/44785/62132) certainly meets your criteria. Sidenote: [it’s simple](http://justinsboringpage.blogspot.com/2013/02/configuring-emacs-to-send-icloud-mail.html) to config a `.authinfo` profile if you’re dedicated to using `Emacs`. <comment222081> The question is really to have best of both worlds: Editing in emacs, but searching via spotlight, reasonable IMAP synchronization, etc. I've used mutt + offlineimap for quite a while, but I've become too old for this. <comment222183> I don't know about automating emacs, so I won't directly answer you. You should be able to use  "Keyboard Maestro". Here is an example of working with another GUI editor: http://rocketink.net/2013/05/quickcursor-keyboard-maestro.html If you make this work with emacs, I would enjoy seeing your answer. <comment222463> What about 'copy/paste' <comment222464> This guy does it in BBEdit and posted his code: http://lists.apple.com/archives/applescript-users/2013/Apr/msg00142.html <comment222549> Copy/Paste was a joke, right? The BBEdit thing looks like a really bad idea in combination with IMAP and also otherwise.  This will break on weak Internet connections, when Apple changes database format, and also it is not for initial composition of e-mails, just for mails that are already stored.
