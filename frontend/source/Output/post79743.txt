How to disable Gatekeeper alerts on opening text files synced with Dropbox? <body> I use WriteRoom to create and edit text files on the Mac (10.8.2). I keep these files in my DropBox (v1.6.14) folder so that they're synced to the cloud and can be edited on my iOS devices and other computers.  I had Gatekeeper set to allow applications downloaded from the App Store and identified developers:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U7ixE.png" alt="enter image description here"  And when I tried to open text files in my DropBox folder with WriteRoom, I got this Gatekeeper alert (which doesn't seem appropriate for the type of file it is):img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t7B3z.png" alt="enter image description here"  I found this annoying, so I set Gatekeeper to allow apps from 'anywhere'. But then I get this message on trying to open these files:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XmKig.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't really mind how Gatekeeper is set but I would really like to disable these annoying warning messages. Does anyone know why they keep appearing and how they can be stopped?  Thanks for reading.  <answer79750> codeman spctl/code  That is good to know, although you can just do:  codexattr -d YourFile.txt/code  This removes the quarantine attribute on files.  With spctl you can add WriteRoom to list of apps that can run. From  codeman spctl/code  precodeEXAMPLES  To check whether Mail.app is allowed to run on the local system:        spctl -a /Applications/Mail.app   To allow Frobozz.app to run on the local system:        spctl --add --label "My Stuff" /Applications/Mail.app   To forbid all code obtained from the Mac App Store from running:        spctl --disable --label "Mac App Store"  /code/pre  <comment92039> Thanks for this. I've discovered that, with Gatekeeper set to allow apps 'from anywhere', previously opened files are remembered and allowed to open without displaying a warning message. <comment92043> You probably don't want to do that. Perhaps add a folder action to Dropbox? Strip off the quarantine attribute on anything going in there, while still requiring strange apps to verify with you that they are going to run.
