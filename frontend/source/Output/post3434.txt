Make an iPhone appear as different model? <body> Is it possible to have a jailbroken iPhone trick an app into thinking you have a different device than the one you're on (e.g., a 3G passing as a 3GS)?  <answer3575> Palm did this with the Pre: the device, like all devices, told iTunes it was an iPod and allowed only the syncing of non-DRM content over the USB connection. As to how the iPhone sorts out what it is to tell iTunes could either be hard-coded or come from a codeplist/code file somewhere in the OS.   Either way, this forum is really not the place the find the answer to that question(nor do I think SO is either). You probably should head over to one of the myriad iPhone jailbreak forum. Searching "iPhone jailbreak forum" in Google brings up a whole host of them.  <comment3131> I closed [this same question previously](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2926/make-a-jailbroken-3g-appear-as-3gs-to-app-closed) as too localized, but if anyone has an answer to itâ€¦ <comment3132> This time I changed it slightly, and made the question for any app, and for any device. <comment3289> Oh so the Apple site is not the place to ask about an iPhone? Anyway it doesn't matter I got a new iPhone. But there 3 up votes on the question which suggest others also want to know. <comment3290> I'm not saying that this SE site isn't the place to ask this question; it's about an Apple product so, technically, it's appropriate. I'm just saying that you'll probably have better luck actually getting an answer about iPhone hacking elsewhere, like in a forum dedicated to iPhone hacking. I know it's not a real answer to your question, but hard hacking questions like this don't get answered much here.
