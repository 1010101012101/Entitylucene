iPhone 5 stuck on spinning wheel (power button does not work) <body> I have a jailbroken iPhone 5. I accidentally tried to reset my settings through my phone instead of iTunes. It has been stuck on the spinning wheel since 10am today (it is now 6:44pm). I've been told to wait until it dies since my POWER BUTTON does NOT work. I tried downloading recboot but kept getting errors, I download reiboot but it does not recognize my phone. I downloaded tinyumbrella and it does not recognize my phone. I also tried to hold the home button while plugging usb in to see if iTunes will recognize it. I don't know what else to do? It is not connected to a service; I only use it on wifi.
