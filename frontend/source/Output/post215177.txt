Spilled water on Macbook Air <body> I spilled water on my 2014 Macbook Air. I had a keyboard cover on, so I don't believe much got into the workings from the top. However, it appears that a decent amount of water got in through the bottom, from what I can tell. I didn't realize how much was in it, so I turned it on a couple times before it dried out, but now it won't turn on at all.  I took apart the entire bottom case according to the iFixit guide (https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Air+13-Inch+Early+2014+Upper+Case+Replacement/24756), looking for signs of water damage. However, there's only one dot that's turned red, on the underside of the battery.   Are there any ways to diagnose which parts of the machine are damaged? Most guides say changes are the logic board needs to be replaced, but since there's no activated water stickers on it, I'm hesitant to purchase another one in case the problem is elsewhere. Is the battery the place to start?  <comment259867> Just get a new battery.  If that doesn't fix it, then you know you have bigger problems, and if you can't afford it to fix the bigger issues, then just go ahead and return the new battery as well, and sell your MacBook Air as-is with a good description of the issues on eBay. You could at least get some money out of it for people who are looking for spare parts. <comment259965> @rubynorails: Yes, but how can you determine which are the bigger issues? I don't have a problem replacing the logic board etc, but I'd rather not spend the money until I'm sure it's the issue. <comment260002> @Asheric - that's why you spend less money on the *battery*, which you *know* is damaged, according to your details.  If the battery fixes your issue, then bingo-bango.  If not, then replace the logic board.  Does that make sense?
