Macbook Pro Retina Late 2013 Hardware Display Issue <body> My Late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina is having an issue with internal display. The lower 2/3 of screen are slightly darker and sometimes display glowing around edges and/or vertical lines. This problem intermittent, it will occur for several weeks and then return to normal for a week before coming back. I suspect it is hardware not software as the issue occurs in the same spot regardless of resolution or operating systems (I have dual boot of Mac 10.11 and Windows 10.) Screenshots also look normal.  I've tried resetting PRAM, no change.  What are the most likely  strongspecific/strong  causes of this display issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZrRh.jpg" alt="2/3rd of screen darker"  <comment325100> When you are experiencing the problem, run [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.   You will be able to determine whether it's your graphics or your display. <comment325102> AHT displays this error: "NNN001 A serial number was not detected" <comment325103> According to the [Apple Diagnostic Reference](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203747) codes, it means that your computer needs to be serviced.   I know it's vague.  Chances are, you have a GPU issue with the logic board. <comment325114> Thanks, the goal of this questions is to determine what "service" my computer needs. I brought it local Apple Service Provider and they didn't even run Diagnostic, just looked at screen "$1,000 dollars, 30 days" both of which are unacceptable. <comment325118> No, no, no, no.  There are further, more in depth diagnostics that are run by repair centers.  I have sent several logic boards to [Rossman Group](https://www.rossmanngroup.com/) out of NYC.  They are top notch.  He even has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w) where he explains how he does all his repairs. <comment325119> One more thing... the [Retina display](https://goo.gl/oeJasv) for your MBP is less than $300.  My guess is they are quoting you a price having no idea what the issue is and hoping for a super cheap issue but planning for the worst case scenario (new logic board for $700-$800).  Run from these guys. <comment325122> Thanks Allan. I'm living in SE Asia and my options for repair centers are pretty limited. I'm hoping to determine exactly which parts need to be replaced before ordering from the USA.  I don't want to order a display and find out it is the logic board for example. <comment325126> Have you tried hooking up to an external display?  You can also try [stress testing](http://www.geeks3d.com/gputest/) your GPU <comment325129> External display works without problem. What will stress test determine? <comment325132> It will determine if your GPU fails under stress.  Not guaranteed, but could show issues.  I am leaning toward your display being bad, but that depends on whether you have a discrete graphics chip or not. <comment325251> It just has the on board graphics. The Stress Test App wouldn't launch in 10.12. <comment325252> Is it possible to use my Macbook as an external monitor for another system? That way I could see if there is a problem with the monitor.
