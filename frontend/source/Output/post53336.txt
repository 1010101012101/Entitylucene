Installing ruby 1.9 on Mac OS X 10.7 <body> I'm trying to install Kitabu on Mac OS X 10.7.4.  When I tried to use codegem install kitabu --pre/code to install kitabu, I got an error    precodeERROR:  Error installing kitabu:         kitabu requires Ruby version ~&gt; 1.9. /code/pre  And the preinstalled ruby is not version 1.9.  precoderuby -v ruby 1.8.7 (2011-12-28 patchlevel 357) [universal-darwin11.0] /code/pre  Can I update preinstalled ruby to 1.9?
