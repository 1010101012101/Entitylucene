Upgrade from non-server to server? <body> Is it possible to upgrade from a non-server (desktop) edition of OS X to the server edition? I currently have a Mac Mini running standard ML but I'd like to upgrade it to the Server version as I use it for a home fileserver and the connections frequently get maxed out. Preferably I'd like to go straight from ML - Mavericks Server, but I don't even know if the desktop-to-server path is possible on any edition without a fresh install (I hope it is).  <answer104510> OS X Server, from OS X Lion onwards, is just another app you buy from the Mac App Store and install. You strongdo not/strong need to do a fresh install of the OS. There are generally no special hardware requirements for OS X Server compared to the client edition either.  To move from OS X Mountain Lion client to OS X Mavericks server, you would first have to upgrade to OS X Mavericks client, then buy and install the Server App from the Mac App Store.  The strongGeneral Requirements/strong section on OS X Server Technical Specifications page currently states:       ul   liMac computer running Mountain Lion./li   li2GB of memory./li   li10GB of available disk space; some features require additional disk space./li   liSome features require an Apple ID; terms apply./li   liSome features require a compatible Internet service provider; fees may apply./li   liSome features are not available in all countries./li   /ul   <comment122957> The "server" component of OS X is an application installed on an existing system. In 99% of cases consumers don't need OS X server, so look into exactly what your needs are and check out if OS X server has anything that meets those needs. Chances are, it won't, it's mainly focused on corporate infrastructure like wikis, contact/calendar/mail syncing, etc. <comment122968> Which connection do max out? Maybe it would be easier to solve this than installing OS X Server, just ask a new question detailing the issue you are facing here. <comment123085> Wow, how did I miss that?! Thank you!!!
