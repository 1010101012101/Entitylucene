Not able to view video in Safari <body> I am trying to view a video in safari and it says there is a plugin missing. The message I get is:  precodeThis page has content that requires an Internet plug-in. This page contains content of “application/x-vlc-plugin” type. You do not have the plug-in required to view this content. /code/pre  I cannot view this video on Chrome as well. Please let me know what I can do to resolve this.  <answer31837> My guess is that you need the VLC plugin, available on VLC download page.  <comment36714> Actually I had already done that. Just needed to restart the browser. Thanks.
