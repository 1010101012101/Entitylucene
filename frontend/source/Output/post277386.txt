Now that   precode$ brew --version Homebrew 0.9.9 (git revision 080c; last commit 2016-08-11) Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision b163b; last commit 2016-08-10) /code/pre  How to properly upgrade to newer version, say 1.1?  precode$ brew upgrade  /code/pre  didn't work.  <answer277391> The right way to solve this is to enter:  precode$ cd "$(brew --repo)" &amp;&amp; git fetch &amp;&amp; git reset --hard origin/master &amp;&amp; brew update /code/pre  Found at http://discourse.brew.sh/t/how-to-upgrade-brew-stuck-on-0-9-9/33.  <comment349153> Maybe you have to do a clean install?
