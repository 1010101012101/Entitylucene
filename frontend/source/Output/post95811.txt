Reopen all the windows after shutdown <body> There was once a feature that reopened all the windows on startup. Is it possible to enable that somehow, even the checkbox "Reopen all windows ..." disappeared.  Did this happen because of an update ? I it possible to revert back to an older version ?  Mac OS version 10.6.8  <answer95822> The Feature is still there.  I do not have 10.6.8 (I have the 10.8.4) and it shows this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ksrZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you do not see it, but had it before then check the  Library/Saved Application State folder to see what files are in it.   I would suggest to run the kbdcmd/kbd and kbdR/kbd and run the repairs from there.  <comment112462> The reopen windows was added in 10.7; and it was never in 10.6.x <comment112996> ok this makes sense now. I have an older macbook, and I had 10.7 installed on it, but I reverted the os back to 10.6 recently. I didn't knew that this feature is available only for 10.7 +
