Is fine volume adjustment possible in OS X Lion? <body> On previous versions of Mac OS X pressing kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdvolume+/kbd would adjust the volume by quarter increments. This seems to have been removed in Lion.   Is there any way to do fine volume adjustment now?  <answer19169> I don't have a keyboard shortcut or AppleScript for you, but I did notice - and others seem to confirm - that the slider you can use when you click the volume icon in the menu bar moves much more smoothly in Lion than it did in previous versions of OS X. As I recall it used to sort of jump from level to level, sort of like how it did when you pushed the volume buttons on the keyboard. Now it slides easily between increments.   <answer19233> You can do precise volume adjustment with AppleScript, controlled on a scale of 0 thru 100.  precodeset volume output volume 0 --mute set volume output volume 100 --100% set volume output volume 27 --27% /code/pre  You can get the current volume (also 0 thru 100):  precodeset currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings) /code/pre  So, you can write a little script to increment the volume by 2% (approximately what one quarter square used to be):  precodeset currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings) set volume output volume (currentVolume + 2) /code/pre  You can make one for decrementing by changing that plus sign to a minus sign:  precodeset currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings) set volume output volume (currentVolume - 2) /code/pre  If you want to get the volume sound like usual, add the following line:  precodedo shell script "afplay /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/volume.aiff" /code/pre  You can save this as a script or app, and bind it to a mouse or keyboard button (if your driver lets you), give it a keyboard shortcut (as a Service or with another app), or put it in your menu bar (with an app like FastScripts).  <answer31442> To get much finer sound volume control I use soundflower from http://code.google.com/p/soundflower/. You have to restart after installing it. Then go to preferences/sound/output and choose soundflower(2ch). Start soundflower from the applications folder, click on the flower symbol in the top pannel and soundflower(2ch) built in output. Then go to Audio setup and change the master for soundflower(2ch). This way you can get the global sound less loud or you can amplify it.   <answer36663> I don't have enough reputation or else I would have entered this as a comment to Nathan Greenstein's answer.  I turned his information into a simple command line script to adjust the volume:  precode#!/bin/bash  usage() {     echo 1&gt;&amp;2 "Usage:" "$0" "[relative volume change in the range -100..100 (default -2)]"     exit -1 }  case $# in     0)         VOLCHANGE=-2         ;;     1)         VOLCHANGE=$1         ;;     *)         usage         ;; esac  ## Check the VOLCHANGE parameter. if ! ( echo "${VOLCHANGE}" | egrep '^-?[0-9]+$' &gt; /dev/null ) then     echo 1&gt;&amp;2 "ERROR: Bad volume adjustment parameter:" "${VOLCHANGE}"     usage fi  osascript -e "set volume output volume ((output volume of (get volume settings)) + ${VOLCHANGE})"  echo "New volume:" $(osascript -e 'output volume of (get volume settings)') "(adjusted by ${VOLCHANGE})" /code/pre  <answer53073> kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⇧/kbd+kbdF11/kbd and kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⇧/kbd+kbdF12/kbd were restored in 10.7.4.  <answer234274> There's also a way to make the volume decrease in 1/4 steps by default. There's a tool you can install called Karabiner, and it already has this logic built in.   So just install it, open the preferences, search for fine grained volume controls, click it, and bam! It just works. What's great is that it switches it so the typical fine-grained keyboard command is now used for large volume steps, and just pressing the volume key will increase/decrease it by a 1/4 step.   https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en  <comment20975> as seen on SuperUser: http://superuser.com/questions/314661/how-to-adjust-the-sound-volume-in-small-increments-in-mac-os-10-7-lion <comment20980> I miss this feature. I can't imagine why they'd get rid of it. It was useful for brightness adjustment, too, although it never worked for keyboard backlight adjustment. <comment21812> I ended up binding these scripts to F11 and F12, so that fine volume adjust is now `fn`+`volume+` using Quicksilver. (thanks to this answer and Jurawa's). Next step is to fake the bezel window. <comment43245> :) I saw the top answer and was just about to do this <comment59719> I'm so confused.  I'm on 10.7 (10.7.4, installed on a fresh 10.6), and option-shift-F11/F12 (volume keys) does indeed change volume in quarter-block increments. <comment235387> How do I set volume above original? (as VLC does) <comment253161> A caveat on Soundflower - it is getting more & more broken since Mavericks & causes kernel panics on Yosemite. It is no longer supported by either Cycling74 or Rogue Amoeba. Current repo is here - https://github.com/RogueAmoeba/Soundflower but hasn't seen an update in a long time.
