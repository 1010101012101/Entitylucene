Mail notification is not deeplinked into the correct conversation on iOS 8 / Exchange Account <body> I'm having this problem since I am using an Exchange Account with my iPhone 5. I get a new mail and receive all notifications correctly. But if I try to open the new mail by either swiping from the lock screen or tapping on the banner when my iPhone's active the Mail app will just show me the last mail I had open.  This seems to be a problem specific to the Exchange-Account since my Gmail-Account is working as expected.  What I've tried so far:  ul liGoogled like a maniac, but so far it seems like I'm the only one having this problem. Or I'm searching in the wrong direction/li liDelete the Exchange-Account and add it again/li liReinstalled my entire phone (without using a backup) to the newest version (iOS 8.3)/li litried to ignore it./li /ul  And now I'm here, since nothing of the above worked. I hope someone can help me with this, since it's very frustrating.  <comment219005> The issue might be exchange server side.  I tried to duplicate this and could not, the lock screen email always opened correctly, regardless of what email had been open last, or whether the mail app was open or closed to start with. <comment219169> Thanks for your comment. Do you have some idea in which way I could point our system administrator?
