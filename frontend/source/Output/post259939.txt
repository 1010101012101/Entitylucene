iOS 10 Bedtime Health Data from iPad to iPhone <body> I'm using the Bedtime feature in iOS 10 on my iPad instead of my iPhone since my iPad has louder speakers than my iPhone. But now how do I see my sleep history? I'm assuming that would be in the health app. But is there a health for the iPad or is that only on iPhone? The data didn't seem to move to my iPhone...  <comment325305> Which version of iPad? and iOS? <comment325315> iOS 10 on both devices. iPad Pro 9.7 and iPhone SE. <comment325323> Can it be saved to iCloud and then accessed on any iCloud-enabled device? <comment325327> I thought it would but I don't see a setting for it... I thought Apple was super privacy focused on the health stuff and they didn't send it to iCloud. I wish they would give me the option...
