How to set alternatives in 10.8? <body> On Linux you can use codeupdate-alternative/code to change the version of a command.  Which command in OS X (10.8) will switch the alternative of the current command?  <answer76722> I understand the motivation behind your question. codeupdate-alternatives/code elegantly solves the problem of managing several installed versions of a program (for example Java) or different ports of a program (codevim/code vs. codeelvis/code vs. codevile/code) by making one of them the default one.  codeupdate-alternatives/code, found in many Linux distros, creates and manages a set of symlinks from code/bin/code, code/usr/bin/code (and the like) to code/etc/alternatives/code, and from there to the location where the program is installed.   For example, in openSUSE codejava/code is symlinked to code/etc/alternatives/java/code, which is symlinked to a "private" path where codejava/code resides:  precode/usr/bin/java -&gt; /etc/alternatives/java /etc/alternatives/java -&gt; /usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0/jre/bin/java /code/pre  Unfortunately, and although some think it would be necessary, at least for MacPorts, strongthere is no such thing in OS X/strong. I have personally solved the lack of codeupdate-alternatives/code with aliases in my code.bashrc/code:  precodealias ls='/usr/local/bin/ls' /code/pre  or simply changing code$PATH/code:  precodePATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH /code/pre  If you can't solve it like this and are weighing the fact of porting it to OS X be aware that although codeupdate-alternatives/code' first incarnation was a Perl script, it was rewritten in C for Debian, and some other distros adopted it later (for instance openSUSE 12.1).   openSUSE 11.4 provides the Perl version as an RPM package. If you are looking for the C version, go for any recent Ubuntu or Debian release, or openSUSE 12.1 or later.  <comment88935> There's no such thing on OS X. What command are you talking about? What problem are you facing or why are you asking? Knowing this would give you a better answer. <comment211386> @slhck One reason one might want this is for the ability to use multiple versions of java, if working on multiple projects that require different versions.
