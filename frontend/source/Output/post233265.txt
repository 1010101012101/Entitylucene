iCloud storage photos <body> I have an iphone 4, with ios 7.1.2, and my phone tells me my software is up to date. When I log into iCloud photos, I can't view any of my photos. There is small print saying "iCloud photos requires ios 8.1 or later..." Does this mean I cannot use iCloud? I am paying for extra storage but where are my pictures?  <answer233266> You can use iCloud photos from a PC, Mac, iOS and web application. So it's conceivable you could use that service even though one of your devices is ineligible to participate due to it not running a supported iOS version.  From a supported web browser, your photos in iCloud are at:  ul lihttps://www.icloud.com/#photos/li /ul  You can review storage at - https://www.icloud.com/#settings  <comment285121> Thank you bmike. I've tried the links you've shown. When I log in to my account and go to Photos, there's still nothing there. I can see my contacts are saved but no photos. <comment285126> @Sally Then you likely have no photos stored directly in iCloud. They could be embedded as part of a device backup - but you'd need to restore that backup to a device to know if photos are there...
