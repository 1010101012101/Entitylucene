Can't add event in calendar on iPhone 6 <body> I am trying to set up a calendar event in my iPhone 6.  I key the entry in and hit add but it's not added to my calendar.  What am I doing wrong?  <comment207344> It's possible that you're adding it to a calendar that's not visible right now. Tap Calendars at the bottom of the screen (outside of an event) and ensure that the calendar to which you are adding the event has a checkmark next to it.
