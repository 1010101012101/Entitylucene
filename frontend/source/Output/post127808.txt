Connecting new 2014 Mac Mini and 2009 Mac Book Pro thru one VGA display <body> Is it possible to connect my mac Book Pro running 10.8.5 and a new Mac Mini running 10.9.2 Mavericks into one Apple VGA display, so as to be able to switch between desktops?  <answer147642> Both MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini have Mini-DisplayPort on them.  You can connect the Mini-DisplayPort to an Minii-DisplayPort-to-VGA converter and then,  connect VGA cable on it to a two-port VGA DDM KVM switch, such as ConnectPRO's UR-12+.  I had been using this configuration for years without problem.   <comment150056> Are you thinking of something like a KVM switch? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch
