Connection to shared network server sometimes stuck connecting, needs restart to fix <body> Sometimes on codeOS X Yosemite/code my connection to a shared network server is stick connecting, while the server is available. codeOS X/code simply won't connect to it using codeFinder/code and the codeConnect As.../code button doesn't respond. It won't eject either. Only a restart fixes everything again, a relaunch of codeFinder/code doesn't help. I am wondering if there's a fix or easier workaround for this.  img src="https://cldup.com/N38eL6kZWf.png" alt="Visual example"  strongEdit:/strong I'm not even sure it can connect to any shared computer at all when this happens and it seems codeFinder/codeaccess is fully broken.  strongUpdate:/strong I'm going to try a few other methods to connect to the server found on http://www.macworld.com/article/2012153/eight-ways-to-connect-to-a-server.html whenever the issue reoccurs.  strongUpdate:/strong I found that the process that (I guess) arranges the connection from codeOS X/code to the server using codeSMB/code hogs up a lot of memory. The command of the process is code/usr/local/sbin/smbd -D -s /usr/local/etc/smb.conf/code. Killing it on the server remounts the drive on codeOS X/code and makes the slowness disappear. On another note: codeOS X/code also often mounts multiple instances of the server, appended with -1, -2 etc. I'm still not sure what causes the issue, but at least I have a quicker fix than a reboot.  <answer208568> I was having the exact same issue. In my case, both my mac and my nas were configured for jumbo frames. My new switch, however, even thought it supports jumbo frames, did not have jumbo frame support turned on. Knocking the MTU on the mac back down to the standard 1500 MTU (under advanced settings, and the advanced tab in network system preferences) got everything working again.   <comment215606> What OS on the remote machines? What protocol? AFP, SMBâ€¦? <comment215608> FreeBSD / SMB. Your comment already helped me a bit while searching for answers to your questions, as I could try to connect using `CMD + K` when the issue occurs again <comment215609> Not sure on BSD, but I know that with Windows over SMB, often a Mac can force a master browser election & win it, even when it shouldn't, which messes up sharing until the correct machine can get back master browser status. I force one [Windows] machine in my network to always win the election; fixed a lot of similar 'weirdness' <comment215611> Does that mess up other computer's connection with the server as well, or do those issues only apply to the Mac causing the issue? As others (both Macs and PC's) can connect to the server just fine while the problem occurs. <comment215612> I used to find it rather randomly affected things, sometimes just one machine, sometimes a few. Since I fixed it to one always-on server, all my woes have vanished. I did have one residual issue for a while, which I fixed with this - http://superuser.com/a/894691/347380 but I don't think that's actually relevant to your situation. <comment215614> Seems very helpful, will try those settings as well. I'll update whenever I'm able to try to apply these methods.
