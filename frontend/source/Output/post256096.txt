Bright spots on carpet <body> So I spot cleaned my carpet where my cat vomited, but now the spot is significantly brighter than the rest of the carpet (the cleaning product maybe removed some of the carpet color). It's an older berber in a very light tan almost greyish colour. Any suggestions on how to camouflage the spot? I've heard of using tea, anyone have any experience?  <comment319253> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because unless the cat is living inside an old Power Mac or Mac Pro tower, he is not Apple hardware.
