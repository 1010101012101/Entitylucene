Missing "Use as Defaults" box in "Show View Options" <body> I am trying to change the default size of my icons and their grid spacing as was asked in this question. For whatever reason, my Mac does not have a strongUse as Defaults/strong box in strongShow View Options/strong. Do you have any idea why it doesn't or what, if anything, I can do to make it so it does?  I checked the answer given to this similar question, but believe I am already in the correct view, as evidenced below. Any ideas on how I can fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZV0c.png" alt=""  <answer294242> All My Files isn't a folder, it's a special view in Finder. Navigate to a real folder such as your Documents folder and the View Options window will show a Use as Defaults button then.  <comment371382> Try on a non-dynamic folder such as Downloads or Documents.  The 'All My Files" is a dynamic type of folder that changes contents much like a Smart Folder.
