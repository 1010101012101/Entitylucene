Can I backup my whatsapp data from an iOS 8 device and use it on an iOS 7 Device? <body> I used to have an iPhone 4s which is broken now, and I got an iPhone 4 from a friend who doesn't need it anymore. I made a backup off my whatsapp chats via iCloud Drive (which doesn't exist on iOS 7), so I can't use them on the iPhone 4. By reading the Whatsapp FAQ I get the impression that this might be completely impossible. Is there any way I can have my chats on the iOS 7 device? It doesn't have to be via iCloud, and I don't mind investing some time to try a few things. Any help is appreciated.
