Does Acrobat Pro XI support Retina display? <body> I have not been able to find any official word from Adobe on this. A Google search only turns up comments from disgruntled users (such as myself) who complain about lack of support in Acrobat X.  So: does Acrobat Pro XI support Retina display?  <answer70286> just installed it: Nope, no retina support yet.    <answer160131> No support for retina with Acrobat Pro XI as of December 2014. Sad because Adobe Illustrator CC displays documents silky smooth. I was under the impression Adobe used the same display engine on both apps)
