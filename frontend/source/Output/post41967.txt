The steps are:  ol liOpen your images in Preview/li liSelect codePrint/code from the codeFile/code menu (or kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdP/kbd)/li liClick on the "codePDF/code" button in the Print dialog and select "codeSave as PDF.../code" from the dropdown/li liProvide a file name and codeSave/code/li /ol  <answer42005> If you have Acrobat, you can simply select create Pdf from the file menu, then merge files into single pdf, it then gives you the option of small, medium or large size options  <comment47622> Thanks!
