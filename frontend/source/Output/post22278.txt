~/Sites folder gives 403 error <body> This is likely a stupid question, and it should be easy, but I'm clearly not seeing it.   My local Sites directory seems to have changed permissions since using it yesterday. It's been working fine for months and I can't for the life of me figure out what's changed.  ul liThe localhost works fine, but my home Sites folder gives a 403/li limy local Sites directory (~/Sites) is 755 permissions, as are the directories inside, and the files are mostly 644/li liPermissions on ~/Sites is drwxr-xr-x+, owned by my shortname &amp; staff, which seems right/li liChecked apachectl configuration and got a "Syntax OK" response/li liJust to be clear, this emwas/em working. My /etc/apache2/httpd.conf allows for user-directories (uncommented) and it resolves the virtual hosts I've set, they all just have some mystical 403 blocking them./li liAdding insult to injury, the Sites work in other user profiles on the machine, and they have the same permissions/li /ul  So - stumped. What am I just not seeing?   <answer22312> Take a look at other directories' permissions; for example, your home directory vs. the other home directories:  precodels -le /Users/ /code/pre  It should look something like this:  precodedrwxr-xr-x+ 13 user1   staff   442 12 Nov  2010 user1/  0: group:everyone deny delete drwxr-xr-x+ 63 user2   staff  2142  9 Aug 16:55 user2/  0: group:everyone deny delete /code/pre  There's a good chance that your home directory has somehow been set to different permissions (e.g. 700), and that's causing Apache to choke.  <answer22327> You have to reach that directory with the running user of the Apache process. You can check that by sudoing to it and try to go there from the code//code (root) directory.  The easiest way is to have the execute permission set for others on every directory from root to your user's codeSite/code directory.  To check:  precodels -ld /Users ~/ ~/Site /code/pre  And the fix:  precodechmod +x /Users ~/ ~/Site /code/pre  (You may need to sudo to modify)  <answer117051> Right click, go to Get Info, and at the bottom you can change permissions.  <comment24672> permissions further back may prevent access, have you ran a disk utility  check permissions? <comment24823> Yep - that was it. Somehow I removed the execution from the directory. Was staring at it and it just didn't register - thanks! <comment24824> Thanks - that helped point me in the right direction. Execution permissions had been turned off somehow (hmm...) <comment25054> I thought I had, sorry.
