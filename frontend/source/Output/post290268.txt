Is there an rsync client that looks and works like an FTP client? <body> Most rsync client GUIs seem to concern themselves with either 'backup' or 'folder sync'.    I am writing a rsync GUI which 'looks like FTP but goes like rsync'br and I'd like to know if such a thing exists already.    After 2 days of Googling I can't see anything that's just quite like this...br I'm talking about something which is a remote file viewer, and lets you drag-n-drop files to/from it.    There are plenty other apps that do this using the SFTP protocol, but I can't see any which use rsync-over-ssh... Most apps that implement rsync want you to choose a direction for synchronization and set a schedule etc etc (e.g. the awesome DropSync.app);br but I just want to throw some files up to an SSH server via rsync......  Some 'wrong' answers are: Transmit, Fetch, Forklift, Yummy and Cyberduck. They all do awesome FTP/SFTP/WebDAV/S3.... but don't seem to do rsync...?   Which is weird, because you'd think it would be strongeasy/strong to add rsync as a protocol to Forklift or Transmit etc...  <comment366412> Related: [Are there any up-to-date rsync frontends or similar for OSX?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208155/are-there-any-up-to-date-rsync-frontends-or-similar-for-osx) <comment366421> As you say, Transmit, Forklift and others can do rsync-*like* syncing... but it presumably makes more sense for them to not use rsync itself, to eliminate the requirement for rsync to be running on the server side. Plus it gives them the freedom to implement things like bidirectional sync, which rsync doesn't support (though I forget if they actually do so). <comment366424> @calum_b you might be right re dependancy avoidance.  I'm just pushing over a precompiled binary if doesn't already exist!  Because, hey, SSH.  Just a case of asking the user if they are okay with that and off we go.
