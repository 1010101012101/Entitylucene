GMail compose on Firefox on Mac cmd+leftarrow cmd+rightarrow <body> I am using GMail and I cannot move to Firefox from Chrome, because the kbdCmd/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbdCmd/kbd+kbd→/kbd do not work in Compose window as "Move to the beginning of the line" and "Move to the end of the line", respectively.  How can I fix that?  (Mountain Lion 10.8.3, Firefox 20.0)  <answer87760> I accidentally found a nice solution for this. I just started using textbox.io for Firefox and the kbdCmd/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbdCmd/kbd+kbd→/kbd work like a charm.
