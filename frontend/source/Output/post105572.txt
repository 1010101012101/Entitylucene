Duplicate mount points on Mac <body> I'm having a problem where the name of my Windows drive changes periodically on my Mac with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.  Example: The Windows drive might be named drive/dept now, but next the name might be drive/dept-2 or drive/dept-4.  I need the location of this drive to be constant to run a script. With the periodic name change I have to check what the name is and adjust the script each time I run it.  Why is this happening? Is there anyway I can stop this?  <answer105576> From your description, this seems like an issue with unmounting the drive not working properly or an unexpected restart of the system. When a drive is unmounted, the mount point under code/Volumes//code should be gone. Otherwise Mac OS X would create a new mount point with suffixes like "-1", "-2" and so on since a name that's currently used cannot be replaced without a proper unmount.  There are a few things you could do to resolve this issue:  ol liEnsure that you always eject the drive correctly./li liRestart the system./li liRemove the duplicate mount point in /Volumes/li liApply the combo updater for Mac OS X 10.6.8 v1.1 and see if that helps./li /ol  References:br Remove the duplicate mount point in /Volumesbr Drives in OS X appearing with '-1' appended to their names  <comment124121> I would be keen to know the answers.  If you could post the script you are running, we could come up with a work around where the script checks the name before it runs and adjusts itself accordingly. <comment124134> Thank you. This really helps. :)
