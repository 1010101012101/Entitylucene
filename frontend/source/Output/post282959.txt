Can I update the flagged emails in Mail 10? <body> After upgrading from Mavericks to Sierra, the flagged emails folder in Mail v.10.3 (3273) has been problematic. The folder shows 8 emails but I actually only have 3. I cannot find a way to update the folder so it only shows 3 flagged emails. Is there a way to do this?

This can be done per mailbox with Mail's strongMailbox  Rebuild/strong command, but it can be simpler and quicker to force a rebuild for all mailboxes emen masse/em by manually deleting the index files.  These instructions work for Sierra. Previous macOS versions had slightly different naming schemes within the emMail/em folder.  ol liIn Mail, choose strongMail  Quit/strong. /li liIn the Finder, choose strongGo  Go to Folder…/strong and enter this path:  ~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData//li liDelete all files whose names begin with emEnvelope Index/em (e.g., emEnvelope Index/em, emEnvelope Index-shm/em, emEnvelope Index-wal/em, etc.)/li liReopen Mail and when prompted, strongContinue/strong to import your existing mailboxes./li /ol  <answer283099> I searched for "flagged" in Users/myname/Library/ and the results showed that the 5 missing emails were located in the "Mail" folder. I double-clicked on each one and it opened the emails. I looked in Apple Mail and each of the 5 missing emails were now shown in the Flagged mailbox.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDxfS.jpg" alt="search flagged"
