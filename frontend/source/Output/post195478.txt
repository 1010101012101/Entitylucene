Upgrade from 10.9.5 to 10.10.* without App Store <body> I can't open the App Store, and I can't open software update. I've tried all the troubleshooting advice I can find online, but none of it solved my problem, so I figured an OS update was overdue. I'm hoping that will fix it.   I can't seem to update without the app store, though!br I ran codesudo softwareupdate --install —all/code and restarted (codesudo shutdown -r now/code), but "About this Mac" still tells me I'm on 10.9.5. (Again, clicking the "Software Update" button tries to launch software update, but fails.)br Now, when I run codesudo softwareupdate —list/code it says, "No new software available."   Is there anything else I can try before I have to take it to the Mac store?  <answer195480> Get someone to download the installer from the App Store - just download it, don't install.

Time Machine is best. The upgrade isn't designed to have problems, but you never know.  <answer195485> I'd really consider trying to fix the existing OS long before exacerbating the situation by trying to force another over it.   ol liStart with Disk Utility - Repair Disk Permissions &amp; Verify Disk [startup from the Recovery partition, kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd R /kbd at the startup chime, if the Disk needs Repairing]. /li liAgain from the recovery partition, reset home folder permissions &amp; ACLs, as per this answer - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/163449/85275   ul liSteps 1 &amp; 2 can instead be performed using the freeware Onyx utility…/li /ul/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ugrAv.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liRun the latest combo updater for 10.9.5 - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1760/li /ol  <comment233366> Also - you can't install a new OS from the command line. You have to get it from a working App Store app. If your Mac isn't cooperating, find another Mac to sign in to the app store and download the installer there. Once you have the installer, USB drive it to the sadder Mac...
