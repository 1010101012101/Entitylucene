MacBook Pro: panic cpu caller kernel trap <body> I am using MacBook Pro with OS X Yosemite installed.  Lately my system is crashing and not booting up.  While system was crashing, the screen was flickering and then it got shut down. I tried to restart and this is what I saw on the screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ad5nT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Sometimes it boots without any problem and suddenly crashes when the booting is about to end up or after logging in one of the account   when I tried to bootup the other time it showed the following screen  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vXJUl.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRxKy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Kindly help me get this fixed.  <comment255790> How old is your MacBook? <comment255797> It was bought around 2012 I guess <comment255800> I ask because Apple has a [repair extension program](https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/) for 15-inch MacBooks made when yours was. This is definitely a possible cause of your issues. <comment255907> But my problem is its not even booting up.I couldn't use my macbook pro anymore.i.e nothing gets displayed in screen.Now I am getting 3 beep and 5 second pause it happens routinely until the laptop is out of power. <comment255979> You appear to have some [loose RAM](https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/199921/MacBook+beeping+3+times). Instructions to fix it can be found in that link as well. <comment256865> Ok I will try this and let you know.Thanks bud
