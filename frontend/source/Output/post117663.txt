Deleting of photos on iOS <body> When photos on iOS are added to an album, does that duplicate the amount of space being used? If I add the photos to another app, can I delete them from the camera roll?  <answer117688> No, when photos from the codeCamera Roll/code are added to an album, it emdoes not/em result in double the storage space being used. The codePhotos.app/code just tracks those photos as being part of that album, in addition to being in the codeCamera Roll/code (which is the default album). Note that if you delete these photos from the codeCamera Roll/code, they will get deleted from the album too (because there's actually only one copy of the photos on the device).  If you add photos from the codeCamera Roll/code to another app and save, the other app receives its own copy of the photo. You can then delete the photos from the codeCamera Roll/code and have them only in the other app.
