How to access Keychain of my user from cron? <body> codesecurity list-keychains/code print:  precode"/Users/vitaly-zdanevich/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db" "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" /code/pre  but the same command from codecron/code return:  precode"/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" /code/pre  from codecron/code I tried  precodesecurity default-keychain -s "/Users/vitaly-zdanevich/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db &amp;&amp; security list-keychains" /code/pre  but result is the same.  In the help of cli-utility codesecurity/code I did not found any other way to explicitly set the path to the db.

Delete a generic password item. /code/pre  so the solution is:  code* * * * * security delete-internet-password -l 'git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com' '/Users/vitaly-zdanevich/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db'/code  last arg string - is it the path to the Keychain db.
