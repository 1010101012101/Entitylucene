How to force text box to move with text <body> Pages: Under Inspector, Object Placement, in order to have a graphic move with the text, one hits that box. And it usually does. In the document I'm working on, there are three cases where it won't switch. What else to try? I've tried closing and reopening the file. Also shutting the computer down and reopening.  One of the answers I read said that under text wrap, hit in-line.  Mine doesn't give me that choice.  <comment297087> Can you provide an example file or a full-window screenshot of a situation where the option does not work?
