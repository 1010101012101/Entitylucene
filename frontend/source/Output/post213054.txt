Change Copy and Paste behaviour system-wide <body> I would like to enhance the global copy/paste behaviour with an additional action.  In particular, I often use Growl to display custom notifications.  From the command line, I can use the codegrowlnotify/code executable to display something like this:  precode$ growlnotify -a "Google Chrome" -m "Text Copied" "Google Chrome" /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tdz92.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'd like to somehow modify the global copy/paste behaviour to create a Growl notification like this no matter where I perform the operation and no matter what I'm copying (text, files, etc.).  Is this possible using Automator/AppleScript (I'm only emvaguely/em familiar with AppleScript)?  Or something else?  <answer213253> You can use applications like Keyboard Maestro (my preference), FastScripts, Spark to run a script which displays notification every time you press Cmd+C, or Cmd+V. Below is the Copy script which posts notification in Growl. Though you could also post these to OS X notification centre too.  precodetell application "System Events"     set foremostApplication to name of first process where it is frontmost end tell tell application "Growl"     register as application "Pasteboard Notifier" all notifications {"Copied", "Pasted"} default notifications {"Copied"}     notify with name "Copied" title "Copied!" description "New Clipboard Item" application name "Pasteboard Notifier" icon of application foremostApplication end tell /code/pre  I tried creating a service through Automator, and binding that to Cmd+C; it didn't seem to work. You'd be better of using a app made to do this kind of work.  emEdit: 05/11/15/em   I noticed that service created via the method above did work in Steam, while not in other Applications. I think because it doesn't have the Edit menu hence no Cut, Copy, and Paste items either. The application shortcuts probably get precedence over services linked to same shortcuts.
