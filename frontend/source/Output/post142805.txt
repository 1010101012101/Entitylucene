Creating ODBC DSN <body> I want to connect to mongo database form OpenOffice (for example) through Simba ODBC driver. I downloaded this driver on the Mac and now I need to register it and DSN in the system.  I installed iODBC and use iODBC Administrator in order to register odbc driver and DSN.(see attached image) I added it here, but when I try to create Database project in OpenOffice added DSN doesn't show up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dEZcq.png" alt="enter image description here"  At the same time I downloaded ODBC Administrator Mac Application and DSN added here shows up in OpenOffice list. Maybe I do not understand something in interface, but I don't know how to add key-value pair here. I can not find a way to actually edit these values. And by default they add Key-Value, Key1-Value1 etc...(See attached image) And this is quite important because you define host, port and database with these pairs.   So, what can I do to add DSN?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/As9k4.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongUPD/strong  I found out how to set key-value pair in ODBC Administrator (it's quite tricky):  ul liclick on word "Key"/li lipress "Enter" button - now you able to "Keyword" field/li lipress "Tab" - now you able to edit "Value" field/li /ul  But I still don't know why DSN from iODBC are not visible in OpenOffice,for example
