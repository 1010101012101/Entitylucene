The screen resolution difference with a retina display <body> I can get the screen resolution of my Macbook pro using the AppleScript code on this site.   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1866912/applescript-how-to-get-current-display-resolution  precodeon getScreenSize()     -- from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1866912/applescript-how-to-get-current-display-resolution     set resolutions to {}     repeat with p in paragraphs of Â¬         (do shell script "system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | awk '/Resolution:/{ printf \"%s %s\\n\", $2, $4 }'")         set resolutions to resolutions &amp; {{word 1 of p as number, word 2 of p as number}}     end repeat     -- return the last one assuming that it should be the one that is not the Laptop screen     return item (length of resolutions as integer) of resolutions end getScreenSize /code/pre  The returned value matches from the information from "About this Mac".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMVVmm.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, when I get the window size from a debugger, it shows half of the value from the system. I make a window to fill in a screen, and check the bounds of the window.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7lYD2.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is confusing and problematic as I'm writing AppleScript code that aligns multiple windows using codeset bounds/code command.  precodeset bounds of s to {x1, y1, x2, y2} /code/pre  What makes difference between the display resolution from a system and bounds of a window? Is it just safe to assume that (system resolution)/2 should be used for setting bounds for retina displays?   <answer294573> MacBookPro has an effective resolution that depends on the Scale you setup for the display.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lfhnjm.png" alt="enter image description here"  You need to use the effective resolution in your code. You can get it from this code, but it works only when there are no external montitors.  precodetell application "Finder"     set screen_resolution to bounds of window of desktop end tell /code/pre  h2Reference/h2  ul lihttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/11488126/get-bounds-of-desktop-with-applescript/li lihttp://osxdaily.com/2014/04/14/change-retina-macbook-screen-resolution-more-space//li lihttp://www.anandtech.com/show/5996/how-the-retina-display-macbook-pro-handles-scaling/li /ul
