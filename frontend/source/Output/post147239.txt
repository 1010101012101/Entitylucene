Weather information on the notification pull-down is useless <body> For example, it's nearly midnight now.  Look at the information I am provided.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h8a6c.jpg" alt="weather information"  Is there any way I can have it show stronguseful/strong information instead, like perhaps...  ul lithe low tonight/li lithe temperature tomorrow morning/li liwill it be rainy tomorrow?/li lithe high tomorrow afternoon/li /ul  <answer147241> The built-in weather information is pretty lame and has no settings associated with it. That said, you should look into other weather widgets that you can install and display instead of the iOS-supplied info:  http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/26/ios-8-weather-widgets-best/  <comment173629> Thanks. I didn't know other apps could put things in the notification center <comment173631> Happy hunting, Lakey!
