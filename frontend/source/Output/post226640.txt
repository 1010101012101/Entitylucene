Put whatever keybind for switching input language <body> I can't set codeCMD + Shift/code as a keybind for switching between input languages of the keyboard. I had to settle down with codeCtrl + Space/code. Why does it allow me to set only some specific key binds?  Is there a way to go around this and set specifically codeL cmd + L shift/code ?   <answer226643> The command as well as the shift key (and some other keys) are modifier keys. You have to add at least one normal key (like A-Z, 0-9, Fn*, arrows etc) to define a proper shortcut.  If you want to change this behavior you have to install a third-party tool like Karabiner.
