How to delete (tmutil delete) all old backups from TimeMachine - keep only current full backup <body> How to delete (with CLI codetmutil delete/code) all old backups from TimeMachine. I wish to keep only current backup.  I wish to put that into codecrontab/code.  Found How to Delete Old Backups from Time Machine on Mac  precodesudo tmutil delete /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBook\ Pro/2015-07-13-150021/ /code/pre  I don't like to specify Timestamps. I wish to have only one current full backup. This means remove deleted files and versions from backup disk.  <answer281617> precode#!/bin/bash latest=$(sudo tmutil latestbackup) sudo tmutil listbackups | while read backup; do     if [[ "$backup" != "$latest" ]]; then         echo sudo tmutil delete "$backup"     fi done /code/pre  Remove the codeecho/code once you are sure that the output is correct.  <comment354337> If you want to do this often I think you are using the wrong tool try Carbon Copy Cloner or Superduper which are designed to just have one copy a <comment354360> But both cost less(and not a massive amount)  than the problems of a bad backup or the time you have spent doing this - but for free look at rsync
