How to change shortcut key of predictive text (autocomplete) <body> I've found codefn+Escape/code or codeF5/code shows a list of auto complete of inputting word. How can I change the keyboard shortcut assignment? I use this function a lot. So, F5 or Fn+Escape seems not a good choice...  <comment266460> I believe it's just Escape. Fn+Esc = Esc. <comment266463> @user14492 OMG! It works. Thanks!
