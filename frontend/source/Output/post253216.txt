Mac starts up automatically <body> My Mac OS X El Capitan seems to start up on its own, out of the blue. Even though I have powered it off. It starts at random.  I do not have any startup program or anything scheduled for this to happen. Any insights? Is this a security risk or effect?  <answer253217> You may have your Mac setup to start automatically. To check follow these steps:  ol liFrom the Apple menu, choose System Preferences/li liSelect Energy Saver/li liClick on the Schedule button /li liCheck the options to see if this is what's causing your problem /li liMake any changes you need to/li liClick OK/li /ol  Hope this helps!  <answer253256> Alternatively, do you have it set to respond to Ethernet wake packets and have something wired that might be sending them?  <answer253322> Check console.app, it logs how the system was started and why. If it's a Maintenance Wake / Dark Wake going wrong, it behaves like you describe in some cases. If it's a preset, it will say something about an RTC Alarm. If it was an external device, it will also mark it so. Long story short: check the logs.  <comment315101> Just to make sure: have you checked that you have turned off automatic booting in System Preferences  Energy Saver? <comment315127> Can you clarify if the machine is fully powered off or if it's in standby? <comment315170> @broodijng_goat Please clarify how you know it is starting up. Does the screen turn on? Did you see activity in the logs? <comment315288> It was checked to wake up at midnight Unchecked it. <comment315289> Looks like it was schedule to start at midnight. Shows the same in console. Thanks
