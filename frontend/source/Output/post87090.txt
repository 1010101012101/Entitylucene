How to programatically add folder to Spotlight "do not index"? <body> Is there any way to programmatically add a folder to Spotlight's "Privacy" tab? Either through Terminal or Applescript?  Often I want to click on an item in Spotlight results in Finder, and have that item's folder no longer be indexed.  I found that if you   precodesudo defaults read /Volumes/foo/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions /code/pre  you can see an array with all the items excluded.  But if you try to   precodesudo defaults write  /Volumes/foo/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add '/path/to/folder'  /code/pre  it does NOT get added to the Privacy tab in the Spotlight Preference Panel, nor does it get de-indexed.  <answer87138> First you have to change the permission settings to add something to the spotlight privacy tab codesudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP /.Spotlight-V100//code  codesudo chmod -R 777 /.Spotlight-V100//code  and then   codesudo defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Exclusions Exclusions -array-add/code should work.  And don't forget to set it back afterwards.  <answer88927> You could also just go to the system prefs pane for Spotlight. There you'll find a privacy tab. Just add the folders and files you don't want to show up in the index. That's it. They've already made it easy so you don't have to use the command line.   And If it's added to the privacy tab you can see what all you have hidden from the index just in case you want to index it it later.  <answer91759> According to an answer here, a folder can be excluded from Spotlight indexing (achieving the same effect as adding it to the Privacy tab, although the folder won't actually be listed there) by either  ul liadding code.noindex/code to the end of the folder's name, or/li licreating an empty file code.metadata_never_index/code inside the folder (eg with codetouch folder/.metadata_never_index/code)/li /ul  You will need to restart Finder after adding  code.metadata_never_index/code, either codekillall Finder/code from Terminal or logout from the Apple menu and then log back in.  <answer255731> You have to stop and start the codelaunchd/code service called codecom.apple.metadata.mds/code. So after:  precodesudo defaults write /Volumes/foo/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add '/path/to/folder' /code/pre  do:  precodesudo launchctl stop com.apple.metadata.mds &amp;&amp; sudo launchctl start com.apple.metadata.mds /code/pre  <comment101802> When I did `-array-add` the folder was added to the plist; it just didn't have any effect. In other words, it showed up with `defaults read`, but it did NOT show up in the Pref Panel. Do you think this permission mod would make a difference? <comment101920> I am not so sure, but the defaults are -rwx-------? <comment101924> Sorry I misunderstood, I thought it would not get added at all. I am not so sure, but the defaults are -rwx-------? In this case you may be right and it should not make any difference if you have it changed -rwxrwxrwx with chmod 777. But it is worth a try!? <comment104680> The question was about how to do this programmatically. Obviously it can be done via GUI. <comment198005> @Ze'ev: A valid point... but next time, since doing it programmatically is so central to the question, you should probably include "programmatically" in the title. <comment237324> @Ze'ev: your question details disagree with your title. You need to make your title clear and accurate to the question
