What is the iOS developer payment schedule? <body> I'm planning to release an iPhone app next week. I have read that Apple pays out 45 days after the end of month (if threshold is reached). My developer account is linked to an address in India if that makes any difference.  So, if I reach the threshold in May, is it safe to assume I will get paid in the beginning of July?  <answer129927> As far as I can tell from https://discussions.apple.com/message/23256906#23256906 you don't get paid for a month after you hit the threshold for payment of $150. Hope this helps!  <answer190094> Developers get paid within 45 days of the last day of the month. For example, the amount you earned in March should be paid to you before mid-May. For my case in March, 2015, I got paid on April 30.  Also note that the minimum threshold depends on the currency and country pair Apple set. If you decide to get paid in the pair Apple set (e.g. HKD in Hong Kong or JPY in Japan), it's $10 USD or equivalent. If not, it's $150 USD.  This information is from Apple's documentation in iTunes Connect.     When will I be paid?      Payments are made within 45 days of the last day of the month in which   book purchases were made. To receive payment, you must have provided   all required banking and tax information and documentation, as well as   meeting the minimum payment threshold.      If your bank and bank account currency is listed in this table, you   must exceed a minimum payment threshold of $10 USD. All other bank   countries and bank account currencies must exceed a minimum payment   threshold of $150 USD.   <comment152157> Thanks Apple guy. How about your personal experience? <comment152159> I only recently started developing so I have yet to publish anything yet to be even able to start working towards the $150. Thanks for asking.
