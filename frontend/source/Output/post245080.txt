Display contents of file and also copy it to the clipboard <body> I would like to create a helper function that displays my public key in the terminal and also copies it to the clipboard. How would I do that?  I tried codecat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy/code, but this only copies the key to the clipboard.  <answer245081> Just paste the clipboard into the terminal window-  precodecat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy; pbpaste /code/pre  or use tee in the pipe with process substitution  precodecat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | tee &gt;(pbcopy) /code/pre  or forget about using pipes altogether  precodepbcopy &lt;~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub; pbpaste /code/pre  <comment302078> While this works, isn't there a more "unixy" way to pipe to 2 commands in parallel? <comment302221> Thank you, it's the second solution I was after!
