Is there any keyboard shortcut to send an email in iOS 9.2? <body> I have an iPad mini with iOS 9.2 and a physical keyboard. The keyboard allows me to use several shortcuts when using some apps (for instance I can use Cmd+T to open a new tab in Safari or close it with Cmd+W).  I was wondering if there is any shorcut to send an email from the default app using a keyboard.  <answer221029> I did not test this myself, as I do not have a Bluetooth keyboard, but I've seen a few article stating that to send an email you could type strongCMD - Shift - D/strong.   <comment267592> It works perfectly. Thanks.
