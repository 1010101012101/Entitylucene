Mail.app doesn't detect address in address book <body> I have a Company name in my Address Book with an e-mail address assigned to it.  The name is Blast Corporation and I want to enter that into the "TO" field in Mail.  Even though Address Book clearly shows it, it does not appear as a suggested address in Mail.app  How can I fix this?  This is in OS X Lion.  <answer57110> Which field is the name "Blast Corporation" in your address book? Supposedly by default Mail only auto-completes addresses that have been used before through Mail. I'm not sure if that is exactly true though, since I just now setup a contact in my address book which I've never used in mail and it auto-completed the company name. It's possible that you need to check a few settings in Mail.app preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CG6pi.png" alt="mail.app auto-complete" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QIm8G.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Here's another example of a company in my address book, which auto-completes in Mail.app  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UVbwq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment65575> How did you get the suggestion in Mail.app?  By typing sales or ACME?  Mail.app doesn't complete addresses for me with company names *even with the default "complete addresses" option set* <comment65577> @ephsmith, yes I simply started typing 'ACME..' and it auto-completed. Do you have the name in the main title of address book like mine is showing? <comment65581> Yes, but mine is actually in the company name field.  The card is marked as a company. <comment65591> @ephsmith, very strange â€” I did mine like you say and it works just fine (see added screen capture). <comment65638> It is strange. That's why I asked.  I only have a few companies that I email and I've had to use nicknames to get completion for a while.  I never had to check the "complete addresses" box because it was that way by default. Nevertheless, no completion on company names for iCloud contacts.
