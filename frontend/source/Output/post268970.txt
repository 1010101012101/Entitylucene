Messages Stopped Working <body> My brother and I shared his iCloud account, and Messages used to work on my MacBook Air; but it stopped working once my other brother got an iPhone and started using the account also.  Messages is not showing up in my system preferences and I am not able to use messages anymore on my Mac.  What can I do to re-sync my phone number with Messages on my MacBook Air?
