How to make automator run an applescript that turns of mac? <body> I want to make an applescript that taps the apple in the corner, taps shut down, and then taps shut down. I can't record it, since it actually involves shutting down the computer, making the script not being saved.  <answer191992> You can use the following in an AppleScript to shutdown the system:  precodetell application "System Events" to shut down /code/pre  If you really want to click the menu items you can go straight to clicking the "Shut Down" button with the following:  precodetell application "System Events" to click menu item "Shut Down" of menu 1 ¬     of menu bar item "Apple" of menu bar 1 of process "Finder" /code/pre  Note: I've add the code¬/code Line-Continuation Symbol to keep from having to horizontally scroll to see the entire line, just remove it and place it all on one line in the script if you want.  If you want to actually bring up the Shut Down message change code"Shut Down"/code to code"Shut Down…"/code.  <comment228282> I've updated my answer with a _click menu item_ example if you still want that.
