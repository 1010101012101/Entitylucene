Full Disk on iPhone but when connected to iTunes there are 6GB free space <body> My iPhone says that Full disk storage, so I went to Settings, General, Usage, and saw this:  ul li0B available 13.3GB used /li liSongs 3.9GB /li liBBM 350MB/li liPhotos and cameras 150MB/li liUP 109MB /li lithe rest of the applications were all less than 100MB/li /ul  Then I plugged it into my computer and it shows a lot of empty space on iTunes, "Others" only occupy 220MB.  I have no idea what's happening, it seems like I have only half of the capacity of the hard drive that I can use.  I suspect that it's the diagnostic information which takes up so much space. Right now I'm syncing it and the progress bar moves very slowly during "Copying diagnostic information".  I already set that I do not wish to send usage and diagnostic information to Apple both on iPhone and iTunes. I don't know why the phone still stores crash logs.  <comment167377> Could you edit your post to show the largest users of data on the phone. Go to settings  general  usage and report the buckets that contain 1 Gb or more data with the size of each... I've had phones with up to 6 GB of discrepancy before, and hopefully yours is less than that.
