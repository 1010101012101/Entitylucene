How to install cURL on OSX with brew <body> How can i get the newerst version of cURL instead of the old 7.24 that Apple provide.  precodeuser:~ kevinsimper$ curl --version curl 7.31.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin12.4.0) libcurl/7.31.0 OpenSSL/0.9.8x zlib/1.2.5 Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp  Features: IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz  /code/pre  When i install with Brew I am notified that it is a keg-only and if i do  precodebrew link curl --force /code/pre  the version is stil 7.24, but the protocols have been updated.  precodeKuser:~ kevinsimper$ curl --version curl 7.24.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin12.0) libcurl/7.24.0 OpenSSL/0.9.8x zlib/1.2.5 Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp  Features: AsynchDNS GSS-Negotiate IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz  user:~ kevinsimper$ which curl /usr/bin/curl /code/pre  If i then delete the "apple" curl, the function is not executable.  precodeuser:~ kevinsimper$ curl --version curl 7.31.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin12.4.0) libcurl/7.31.0 OpenSSL/0.9.8x zlib/1.2.5 Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp  Features: IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz  user:~ kevinsimper$ brew install postgresql ==&gt; Installing postgresql dependency: ossp-uuid ==&gt; Downloading ftp://ftp.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/uuid-1.6.2.tar.gz Error: /usr/bin/curl is not executable /code/pre  <answer95857> Add codeexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH/code to your code.bashrc/code for example to use the bin installed with Homebrew.   <comment112496> Don't delete Apple supplied files - the OS might still use them and it won't use homebrew files. To use the homebrew file you need to set your PATH - see may questions here <comment112536> Or .bash_profile. Terminal and iTerm open new shells as login shells by default, so bash doesn't read .bashrc. <comment137211> Will this cause problems for the system since you're putting the new curl's binary in front of the system's curl binary? <comment137221> Nope since it's only for your terminal session. <comment324630> When I do this, it still shows `/usr/bin/curl` as the result of `which curl. Any advice?` <comment325664> @MadPhysicist run `brew link curl --force` to force Homebrew to symlink curl into `usr/local/bin`. As long as that is ahead of `/usr/bin` in your path, then the Homebrew curl should be used.
