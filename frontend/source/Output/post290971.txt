What happens to things in SIP restricted folders when upgrading to 10.11? <body> What will happen to changes made to folders such ascode/System/code or code/bin/code (full list here) when upgrading to El Capitan or Sierra?  <comment367349> As these have always been Apple controlled folders I would expect that any upgrade even before SIP would replace them all with what should be there for the new OS. I don't think SIP changes this behaviour <comment367350> @Mark I'm talking more like things added to `/System/Graphics/` or kexts added to the `/System` folder. They haven't been touched by previous upgrades.
