Often, My iPhone 5s won't turn on or charge. I know how to fix this, but why does it happen? <body> I have an Apple iPhone 5s, which I have owned since I got it for Christmas in 2015 (it previously belonged to my parents). Often, I have encountered a problem where my iPhone will turn off and not charge.   I know how to fix it (soft reset), but what could I do to prevent my 5s from doing this?
