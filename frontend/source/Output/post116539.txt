Setup local network on Mac and share it via WiFi, but with no internet connection <body> I woat to use my iPhone as remote control for VLC. I use http://hobbyistsoftware.com/VLC-more and it is working fine when I am connected to my AirPort network.  I will use my MacBook at a place where there is no AirPort connection (even currently is not available) for playing videos.  Is it possible and if so how do I run my mac as default gateway and access point but just for local network so that I can connect my iPhone to it ?  Thanks in advance  <answer116544> If you have WiFi turned on then you have a pizza slice icon at the right of the menu bar. If it isn't there then open codeNetwork/code in codeSystem Preferences/code to make sure WiFi is on and you have codeShow Wi-Fi status in menu bar/code selected.  Select codeCreate Network.../code which will open up a dialog where you can specify a network name and security. I usually change security to code40-bit WEP/code just so the link is secure.  You can now connect to this network from your iPhone in the same way as any other WiFi net.  <comment136320> To be noted that WEP-40 and WEP-104 are easily broken, deprecated and superseded by WPA/WPA2. Nobody should use WEP anymore, if possible. <comment136450> @Jawa I will be using this in the middle of wilderness. there is no electricity for one km around it. So in my case I do not need to worry about security. Also this "Create Network.." is only giving WEP, WPA2 is not available. <comment265967> How do you connect to this network from a non-mac computer?
