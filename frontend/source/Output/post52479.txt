Changing the range of addresses served to clients connected via Internet Sharing <body> Macbook Pro Running 10.7.4 attempting to share ethernet connection via Airport(Wi-Fi) and trying to serve 192.168.1.x addresses to connected clients.  I've tried the guidance provided here em(Dead link as of June 2016)/em and the  article Mac OS Hints: Change the default subnet for Internet Sharingbr My codecom.apple.nat/code file has the following:   precodeNAT =     {     AirPort =         {         40BitEncrypt = 0;         Channel = 0;         Enabled = 0;         Extreme = "";         NetworkName = *****;         NetworkPassword = &lt;*****&gt;;     };     Enabled = 1;     NatPortMapDisabled = 0;     PrimaryInterface =         {         Device = en0;         Enabled = 0;         HardwareKey = "";         PrimaryUserReadable = Ethernet;     };     PrimaryService = "352E1799-A5BD-45F7-8C1C-49A963899CFC";     SharingDevices =         (         en1     );     SharingNetworkNumberStart = "192.168.1.0"; }; /code/pre  But no dice. codeifconfig/code still shows en1 as 10.0.2.1 I've rebooted, made sure System Preferences was closed. en1 up'd and down'd   I'm guessing I need to be modifying a different file. I've looked at the binary for strongInternetSharing/strong but it has way too much cruft in the file for me to confidently edit it.  Any help? Thanks!  <answer52512> Apparently, as you say, you need to modify the strongInternetSharing/strong file, adding:  precode&lt;key&gt;AirPort&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;dict&gt;             &lt;key&gt;40BitEncrypt&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Channel&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Enabled&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Extreme&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;key&gt;NetworkName&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;imacnet&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;key&gt;NetworkPassword&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;data&gt;cwB0AHUAYQByAA==&lt;/data&gt;             &lt;key&gt;SharingNetworkNumberStart&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;10.0.99.0&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  It seems pretty straight forward.  <answer243825> This is specifically for Ethernet  Ethernet Sharing connections, rather than WiFi (it emmight/em work for WiFi but I haven't tested) - I thought the answer would best belong here, for Google.  Tested as working up to El Capitan 10.11.5  Apparently since Yosemite, adding just the codeSharingNetworkNumberStart/code key is no longer sufficient.br Also, System Prefs caches the NAT file located at code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat/code &amp; will just overwrite your settings again, if you do things in the wrong order.br emActual addresses are, of course, your choice./em  ul liSwitch off internet Sharing.br Close System Prefs/li liIn Terminal type these 3 commands    precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat NAT -dict-add SharingNetworkNumberStart 192.168.0.0 sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat NAT -dict-add SharingNetworkNumberEnd 192.168.0.20 sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat NAT -dict-add SharingNetworkMask 255.255.255.0 /code/pre/li liOpen System Prefs  Networkbr Select what is to be your shared port &amp; set as follows    Configure IPv4: Manuallybr IP Address: 192.168.0.1br Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0br Router: 192.168.0.1br Then in Advanced...

Info worked from Mac OS Hints: Change the default subnet for Internet Sharing  <comment60116> I wish it were as straight forward as it appears. The InternetSharing file mentioned is a binary file and not an easily editable plist. Looking at it with vim is a mess. The standard InternetSharing.plist file does not appear to manage the Airport configuration. Instead it has an argument which called the InternetSharing binary file. I'm looking for a clean way to edit the binary file. <comment60131> You are right, it's a hell of a mess. Couldn't try it until now. I'll keep searching, though. <comment300356> You change the `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat.plist`, which is plain text, not the Internet Sharing file in `/usr/libexec/`. I added a new answer for how to do this for Ethernet rather than Wifi, if someone wants to tweak to suit for Wifi too. <comment301332> I dug into this a while back: not a complete answer, but perhaps some useful details... http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/135163/22953
