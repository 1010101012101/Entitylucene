Copy folder & files with labeled files but strip the label? <body> Is there an easier way to copy a folder that contains files with (colored) labels applied and strip those labels than making an Automator droplet/application?  So perfect would be having this to happen, but have it happen "by default" if I press kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdD/kbd...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vwk3Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  Automator goes like this...  precodeApplication receives files and folders as input Duplicate Finder Items Get Folder Contents (actually, the "Repeat for each subfolder found" should be checked) Label Finder items (nothing selected, with is what happens when you click "x") /code/pre  Seems clunky, but when I've got Smart Folders returning, eg, all yellow labeled files, I don't want copies when I back a folder up by duplicating it.  The app works fine, but wanted to know if there was an easier way.  <answer44337> You can set your Automator application as a service instead, and then apply a keyboard shortcut against that service as follows:  In strongSystem Preferences/strong, go to strongKeyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services/strong  Find the service on the list.  To the right of the service name, double-click.  Enter the desired shortcut.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WTC3b.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment50977> Hrm, that's asking for my password, then copying without removing the label.  Seems promising, though.
