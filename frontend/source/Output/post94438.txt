Legitimate user or hacker -Terminal? <body> I have recently used the terminal and entered the command codesudo -s/code and then codedscl . -list /users/code  so I could see all accounts/users who have access to my mac.   How do I know which names are supposed to be there and which aren't? Luckily I read on another post that emnobody/em and emdaemon/em appeared in their list so that calms me down slightly, but does anyone have a link to a list of which accounts are suppose to be there?   Right now, there are over 25 names, a lot look like file locations but I am freaked out!  <answer96592> All users account starting with an code_/code are automatically generated by the system. For example, code_lp/code is an account used to manage the Printing Services without the use of the priviledged account coderoot/code. This is a separation of priviledges and a good protection.  For all other account names, codedaemon/code and codenobody/code are also generated by the system.  For the remaining accounts, let's say you see a suspect user account codebond/code, use the following command:  precodefinger bond /code/pre  to check what codebond/code account is used for and when it was last used to connect on your system.  <comment110715> The number of entries doesn't surprise me. If you want somebody to look over the list and give feedback, please put the whole list into the question.
