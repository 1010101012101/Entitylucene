SMB share only accessible with FQDN or IP address, netbiosname no longer resolves <body> We have several Macs in our office, ranging from 10.5.8 - 10.8.2.  Until a few days ago all of the machines could access all of our file servers, running on Win 2007 server, using just the netbiosname by "Connecting to Server" in Finder.  Basically they could reach the share by connecting to "emsmb://Server1/MyFiles/em".  Well, a few days ago we migrated one of our file servers (emServer1/em) from a physical box to a VMWare VM.  Ever since that change we have been unable to connect with our 10.7 &amp; 10.8 Macs using our traditional method.  Attempting to do so results in a "Server not found" error. The workaround that we've found is that we can still connect using either the FQDN or the IP address, such as "emsmb://Server1.Domain.Extension/MyFiles/em" or "emsmb://160.1.1.1/MyFiles/em".

We also considered DNS but with it pinging properly, and the older Macs &amp; Windows machines connecting properly, we have a hard time believing that.  Has anyone run into this before or have any ideas?  <answer84719> Our network person figured it out. This was his explanation of the issue &amp; the fix, just in case anyone runs into a similar migration issue in the future     Using the smbutil lookup command in terminal I was able to see that   the Macs were resolving the NETBIOS name of the server to two wrong IP   addresses. Since SMB uses WINS to resolve names I was able to find the   offending IP addresses by querying the WINS list. I deleted the old   ones out and put them in statically for Server1.      This happened because converting to vsphere does not bring over   network info since it assigns new nics. The new nics picked up DHCP   and were then registered into WINS and DNS this way. We changed DNS   right away making it work for the FQDN and for Windows machines.   Something to do after the conversion next time.   <answer99629> I had been using 10.7 for the last two years, and have a Windows 7 server in the closet that I use to share files with all the Mac and Windows users in our office, of which there are equal amounts of each due to their differing roles (Accounting, Coding, Editing on FCP).  As an Apple support tech, I have seen many of my clients with odd issues as soon as they upgraded, and it made me hesitate to move to Mountain Lion; but I just purchased a new Macbook Pro, and finally wanted to see if I could resolve any upgrade issues I had in order to help future clients.  OF COURSE! The first thing that happened was my ability to connect to the Windows shares using a Netbios name was gone.  Even with the exact same settings migrating from 10.7 to 10.8, I now had to use the IP address of the server, as Mr. Rabbit above illustrated, or by installing Samba...a daunting task involving tons of Terminal commands. Not interested in overkill; I like the principle of Ockham's razor when it comes to this stuff.  I decided to take a look at what I could do with this issue, as I attempted yesterday to resolve it but couldn't figure it out.  After a night's rest (and a strong cup of joe) the answer revealed itself.  (I'm running 10.8.4, fyi.)  ol liOpen codeSystem Preferences/code./li liGo to codeNetwork/code./li liHighlight your codeNetwork/code (ethernet or wireless) and click the codeAdvanced.../code button./li liSelect codeWINS/code from the Menu items.

I'm glad you figured this out! <comment97584> I know the feeling, I'm way past my time dealing with Windows Servers.  Needless to say I was happy to let the network guy figure this one out!
