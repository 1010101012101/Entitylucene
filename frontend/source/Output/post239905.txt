How do I fix iTunes could not copy unknown error (-5000)? <body> I got this error trying to sync from my Macbook Pro (OSX Yosemite, 10.10.5) to my iPhone SE:     iTunes could not copy "The Song Remains the Same" to the iPhone "Dan's Phone" because an unknown error occurred (-5000).   Oddly, the problem didn't occur with my previous iPhone 5s.  How do I fix it?  <answer239906> The solution was simple - it was a permissions problem.  On the Mac, here are the steps I took to fix:  ul liNote the song that fails, on my case it was a Zeppelin song./li liUsing the terminal, cd to the directory containing the song/li liRun codels -la/code and note the owner/permissions of the file that fails, in my case it was an alternate username I was using at one point, let's say that username is paulhewson, and your real username is hewson/li liRun codesudo find . -user paulhewson/code from the top level music directory (~/Music), this shows all the music that is owned by this alternate user/li liThis command will change the owner to your normal username: codesudo find . -user paulhewson -exec chown hewson {} +/code/li /ul  I suspect this error could result from any sort of permission problem, in some cases maybe read-only or locked files, in which case you'd want to chmod or unlock the files.  If there are multiple types of permission problems, you may need to repeat this process a few times.  Might be easier to chmod/chown everything in music, but I tried to avoid that so I didn't cause other issues.
