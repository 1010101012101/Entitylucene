How to install Snow Leopard from USB where USB disk is prepared using Linux? <body> I'm trying to install Snow Leopard (a retail version) into my MacBook, but seems like that the MacBook can't find the boot disk over USB.   I guess this is related to the fact that I mounted the .iso of Snow Leopard via Linux, using codedd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdx/code and this rewrites the boot sector.  Is there a way to copy the ISO into my USB disk via Linux and make the MacBook recognize this?   <answer61698> Why use Linux for this? Just do it in OS X. To prepare the USB drive (e.g. 8-GB flash drive), you need to partition it using the strongGUID scheme/strong and format it to the file system standard strong'Macintosh Extended (Journaled)'/strong, also known as 'HFS+ (Journaled)'.  Then use Disk Utility's strongRestore/strong feature to copy the contents of the iso image file em(Source)/em to the USB drive em(Destination)/em. When done, restart the Mac keeping the strongOption key/strong pressed â€“ the USB drive should then show up in the boot volume lineup...   There are many tutorials for this process on the Internet, e.g., http://www.maciverse.com/install-os-x-snow-leopard-from-usb-flash-drive.html  <comment71097> I know nothing about Linux, what is the partition map of your USB drive? It needs to be GPT (GUID) <comment71119> I partitioned my USB via Disk Utility, and set the map to GUID type
