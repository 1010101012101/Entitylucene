Spotlight Woes! Can't search, can't reindex, can't find <body> Help!   Spotlight stopped working ... if I go to spotlight search (top right), it just hangs.  Same with Apple-F in Finder ... it causes Finder to hang for a minute or so. Cannot search.  I went to Spotlight Sys Prefs. Switching to Privacy Tab takes like 10 seconds. Then If I try to add a drive to Privacy tab, it either crashes SysPrefs, or gives me this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ik2ty.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I tried all kinds of things I found online, like   precodesudo mdutil -a -i off sudo mdutil -i on sudo mdutil -a -E -v sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist sudo mdutil -aEv  sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100 sudo rm -rf /Volumes/0/.Spotlight-V100 /code/pre  etc...  I tried rebooting from a backup System drive &amp; repairing permissions from Disk Utility.  But it still doesn't work!  Help! OSX 10.6.8  hr  strongUpdate/strong: some more weirdness: The plist for mds tries to launch code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework/Support/mds/code  But if I look inside code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework//code  I see that codeSupport/code is just a hardlink to codeVersions/Current/Support/code  codeSupport -&gt; Versions/Current/Support/code  Then looking inside codeVersions/code I see only one folder called codeA/code and inside that are codeHeaders, Metadata, Resources, Support/code -- and inside codeSupport/code is: codemds,mdworker,mdworker32,mdwrite/code  Should I edit my codecom.apple.metadata.mds.plist/code to launch code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework/Versions/A/Support/mds/code ??  What the heck is this codeA/code folder???  <comment62371> Does anything interesting show up if you search for `md` or `spotlight` in `system.log` in Console? <comment62374> Yes, actually! This repeats over and over: `com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.metadata.mds[31908]): posix_spawn("/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework/Support/mds", ...): No such file or directory com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.metadata.mds[31908]): Exited with exit code: 1 com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.metadata.mds): Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds` <comment62376> But it stops after I do `sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist` <comment62384> Frameworks can contain multiple versions in directories like A, B, etc. com.apple.metadata.mds.plist should already launch mds. Can you try upgrading to 10.7 or upgrade installing 10.6 again? <comment62395> What does `ls -l /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework` show? <comment62443> @Mark: `lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   24 Sep  5  2011 CodeResources - Versions/A/CodeResources  ` `lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   24 Nov 23  2011 Headers - Versions/Current/Headers  ` `lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   25 Sep  5  2011 Metadata - Versions/Current/Metadata  ` `lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   26 Sep  5  2011 Resources - Versions/Current/Resources  ` `lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   24 Sep  5  2011 Support - Versions/Current/Support  ` `drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Jun 13 17:38 Versions `
