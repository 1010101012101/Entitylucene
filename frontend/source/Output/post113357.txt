ssh tunnel in osx -- connection refused <body> I'm trying to use an SSH tunnel for a web proxy. I've done this sort of thing before (for games.) I fire up firefox and tell it to proxy through localhost 12345 for everything. Then, codessh user@host -L 12345:localhost:8080 -N/code. When I try to use the browser, I get "connection refused." I enabled all the flags in sshd_config and restarted. No idea how to proceed. HALP!  <answer113359> I think you are mixing up two commands. Try to set Firefox to Socks5 at port 12345 and run:  precodessh user@host -D 12345 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xb5QI.png" alt="enter image description here"  From the SSH manual, 'man ssh':  precode-D [bind_address:]port Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding. ... Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act as a SOCKS server. /code/pre  Your command codeuser@host -L 12345:localhost:8080 -N/code forwards your local port 12345 to the remote host's port 8080. This would only work if there would actually be a proxy running on port 8080 on your remote host.
