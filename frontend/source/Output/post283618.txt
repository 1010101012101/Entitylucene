Disable notification prompts Safari 10.1 <body> I am trying to prevent notification prompts from various websites in Safari 10.1. In the past one could go codepreferences &gt; notifications/code and uncheck codeAllow websites to ask for permission to send push notifications/code, as pointed out in this answer.  I still get notifications prompts from some websites strongwhether or not/strong that box is checked/unchecked...  Is this a bug with Safari or I am forced to codechmod/code the remote notifications directory?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AAkMV.png" alt="notification prompt"
