How to disable iMessage on MacBook Air only? <body> If I untick 'Enable iMessage' in prefs on my MacBook Air, will that stop messages going to it? I only want them on my iPhone.  If I do the 'Delete account' thing as advised in one video, I am worried iMessage might not work on my iPhone either.  <answer171824> You can do either.   Disabling your Apple ID in iMessage will allow you to quickly re-enable it if you choose to use it on your Mac at a later time.   Deleting your iMessage/Apple ID account from iMessage preferences on your Mac will strongnot/strong affect iMessage on your iPhone. The only thing that it will affect is your ability to send and receive messages, either iMessages or Text Messages, from your Mac.   <answer171825> You can also just deselect your Apple ID from iMessage as well. You would have to go this way:  ul liOpen codeMessages &gt; Preferences/code/li liEither deselect codeEnable this Account/code or deselect everything in codeYou can be reached for messages at/code./li /ul  And Slidmac07 is right, deleting the account on your Mac won't affect iMessages on your iPhone. :)
