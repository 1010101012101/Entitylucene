User Log In wont work, seems to be a software issue <body> I am not familiar with the likes of computers.  My mac book air is having an issue with accounts. My guest portal works perfectly fine I am able to log in and use my computer.  My admin portal (the one that requires a password) is not functioning properly. As soon as I type in my password (correctly) the computer turns of immediately after.
