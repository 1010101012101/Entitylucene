Is there a way to rename "Remaining" to "Apple Juice Remaining"? <body> On a MacBook Pro, is there a way to change the text in the battery life drop down?   Specifically, where it says "X:XX Remaining" I want it to say "X:XX of Apple Juice Remaining"  Why? Because a good pun is its own reword.  Yes, this is a serious question.  Yes, I tried googling first.  I'm currently running Mavericks, though an upgrade to Yosemite is probably in my near future.  <answer154711> You want to change line 92 of the xml version of  code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Battery.menu/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings/code:  ol liMake a copy of the strings file:  precodecp /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/Battery.menu/Contents/Resources/\ English.lproj/Localizable.strings ~/Desktop /code/pre/li liConvert the binary strings file to xml:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Desktop/Localizable.strings /code/pre/li liEdit line 92 (Yosemite) of the file now on the desktop with your favourite text editor:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yDhoz.png" width="276"/li liConvert the xml strings file back to binary:  precodeplutil -convert binary1 ~/Desktop/Localizable.strings /code/pre/li liBack up your existing file! If you mess up, this will let you reverse your changes by removing -bak from the file name.  precodesudo mv /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/Battery.menu/Contents/Resources/\ English.lproj/Localizable.strings /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/\ Battery.menu/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings-bak /code/pre/li liOverwrite the old file with the new:  precodesudo mv ~/Desktop/Localizable.strings /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/\ Battery.menu/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/ /code/pre/li /ol  hr  Result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X8kba.png" width="271" title="Apple Juice Remaining"  <comment182006> You sir are a genius. <comment182008> I was wondering how you'd be pulling this off, but of course - locales! Nice. <comment182033> Very nice solution.  Note that for me the line numbers weren't the same, but it being a simple xml file it wasn't exactly difficult to track down the keys that needed to be changed.  I took it further and changed other parts of the dialog text as well.  Thanks for indulging my sense of humor :) <comment182037> Also: +1 for inserting the backup step, though it should probably be spelled out that you did so (users that stumble across this via google might not pick up on it) <comment182042> "Because a good pun is its own reword." *groan* <comment182044> You forgot to modify "Power Source" from "Battery" to "300mL Apple Juice Box". You could also change "charger" for "refilling machine". <comment182138> I actually went back in and made some additional modifications after I posted that picture, though I didn't think of "Apple Juice Box/Apple Juice Dispenser" as power sources.  haha <comment182166> Thats funny! :D <comment182236> Something's missing from your instructions--I don't see anything in there about backing up your System file before you open ResEdit. <comment182284> I signed up just to point out that this is the exact reason us non-Apple users hate you all. <comment182338> @JonathonReinhart You mean because Apple-users think this is funny, or because Apple-users can actually do this? <comment182378> @grgarside [ResEdit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit) was the way we edited resources back in the pre-OS X days. dodgethesteamroller was being funny. <comment233118> Does this procedure work in El Capitan? <comment233137> @user24601 Yes, if you disable System Integrity Protection.
