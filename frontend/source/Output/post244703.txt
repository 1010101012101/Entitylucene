How can I use my thunderbolt 2 hard drive on the new (usb-c) Macbook? <body> I want to upgrade my ageing Mac Mini to a new mac this fall (probably a new macbook pro) and I'm assuming they'll be USB-c only.  I have 2 big external hard drive daisy chained that only have Thunderbolt 2 plugs. I am stuck with this current generation of machine or is there a way for me to adapt these hard drive on usb-c somehow ?  Thanks a lot in advance guys =)  <comment301620> AFAIK At the present time there are no USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 Adapters however since Thunderbolt 3 will be using the USB-C type plug there will probably be some sort of Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 Adapter coming, although I can't say when. <comment301628> So you mean it's possible that the next usb-c Apple laptopt will support Thunderbolt via their usb-c port, right ?  Otherwise, not possible right now ? <comment301647> All I can tell you is at the present time Apple doesn't sell a USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter in any combination. I also Googled _USB-C to Thunderbolt Adapter_ and didn't find anything till I searched for _USB-C and Thunderbolt 3_ just to see what would come up and this is where I found information about the Thunderbolt 3 using the USB-C type plug and assume that in the future there will probably be a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 Adapter.  As to whether or not Apple's USB-C port will support Thunderbolt 3 in the future I can't say.  However it's logical to think that it will at some point.
