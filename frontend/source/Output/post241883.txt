HDD corruption after power cutoff <body> Yesterday a breaker tripped in the same room as my Mac Pro 1,1 running Yosemite (Hacked boot.efi.) All other machines powered up but this one. Attempting to mount via Target Disk Mode timed out, so I pulled the drive and put it in a sled so I could access it with my MacBook. First attempt was with Disk Utility, it failed (Who'd have guessed?) I then popped open a terminal window and ran a fsck_hfs -r -d and it appeared to be doing work, but failed to fix the issue. I tried running it several times but to no success.   Posted is my log file, which is odd. There are 2 files which have no thread records, and when fsck_hfs attempts to make them, it returns OK, but appears to have failed on account of it re-attempting multiple times. Anyone else have issues with inconsistent thread counts, and if so, how did you go about a repair? (I know there is always backup, reformat, and reinstall, but given the nature of data and configurations on the drive, I'd like to avoid it as much as possible.)  precodesudo fsck_hfs -r -d /dev/disk1s2journal_replay(/dev/disk1s2) returned 0 ** /dev/rdisk1s2     Using cacheBlockSize=32K cacheTotalBlock=24576 cacheSize=786432K.

Fixed the thread-count issue on the first pass. It's a shame that this wasn't easily possible with non-commercial tools, but DiskWarrior does it's job extraordinarily well.
