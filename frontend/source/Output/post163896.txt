Finder's akward filesize behavior <body> Updated my os from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion a week ago and noticed strange filesize info inside 10.8.5's finder. The info on filesize/foldersize in 10.8.5 is different from 10.6.5. While a folder that consist purely of symlinks was stated with few kb in 10.6 is now stated with symlinks resolved sizes. For me this is very disturbing and i wish the size info like it was given by snow leopard's finder.  Example (finder's view | term's codedu/code output):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9QGP.jpg" alt="dont get fooled by the sizes in terminal, hfs+ compression was applied"  em(strongnote/strong:sizes between term and finder differ because of hfs compression)/em  With info like this i cant tell whats going on without inspecting the package or using the terminal.
