Finding mysql username and password <body> I have used the binary installer on my mac and use the following to start mysql.  codesudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM start/code  It seems to start ok, but i haven't set up any passwords for users yet. I followed the instructions here from MySQL https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/default-privileges.html  codemysql&gt; SELECT User, Host, Password FROM mysql.user;/code  This just returns code-bash: mysql: command not found/code  I'm a first time mac user and don't really know how to fix this?  <answer128631> Solved it i think  codeexport set MYSQL_HOME=/usr/local/mysql-5.6.17-osx10.7-x86_64/code  codeexport set PATH=$PATH:$MYSQL_HOME/bin/code
