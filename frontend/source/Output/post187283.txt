How to get GPS Coordinates on Google Maps? <body> Apparently, the feature to right click on a location ("what's here?) and get GPS coordinates for a location while in Google Maps has been changed recently.  Now all I get is street addresses or worse when I right click on a location.   Are GPS coordatines available through Google Maps now?  If not, can we get that feature back?   I'm simply using a laptop that runs MS Explorer---nothing fancy or overly-mobile or exotic.    <answer187285> Don't know what it has to do with Apple…  … but the coordinates are in both the info drop-down &amp; the URL  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SpHGq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment221296> When I do that, I only get a street address, or just the county name.  No cooridates anywhere. <comment221297> Then you need a different browser. Internet Explorer for Mac was discontinued in 2005.
