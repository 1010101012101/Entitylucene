In Full-screen prevent Dock to unhide when mouse hits bottom <body> (using Mavericks 10.9.2 (latest))  Using an application in strongFull-screen/strong (eg VirtualBox), is there a way strongnot/strong to have the strongDock/strong show when the strongmouse/strong hits the bottom of the screen?  Tried  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 3 /code/pre  to increase the delay (3 seconds) the mouse has to stay at the bottom to get the Dock unhide. But it's been confirmed to have no effect in Mavericks (10.9.1, 10.9.2) emwhen in full-screen/em.  (No option in VirtualBox either, this is a problem in any (most?) full-screen app anyway).  <comment148005> does adding the killall Dock help ? <comment148009> @Buscarì›ƒ Nope. Did it along the other instructions to change the delay. <comment148025> If you use the trackpad, you can lift your finger as soon as the cursor hits the bottom of the screen to prevent the dock from popping up. I don't know of an equivalent for the mouse, though. <comment148736> @daGuy I'm using the trackpad, so the tip works... however that's not very convenient / practical. Thanks anyway. <comment280733> I'm using this: defaults write com.apple.Dock tilesize -int 1 && killall -HUP Dock This will make the Dock very very small. Not a perfect solution but the best I found. <comment281480> @LeszekS that's an idea, thanks
