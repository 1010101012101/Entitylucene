Application Support directory, some apps are using tons of space! <body> After running out of space multiple times, I started researching and putting a strategy to permanently fix this issue.  In the end I found that Application Support is an important directory for most of apps, but I've a directory called strongGoogle/strong with 2.2 GB size. Most probably this is for Chrome only. What does this directory include and what will happen if I delete it?  Including information about directories and their sizes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JyGQP.png" alt="Including information about directories and their sizes***"  <answer202516> It appears to be local storage, used by websites to store temporary files. This article explains how you can use Chrome itself to inspect the contents in more detail.  Seems like it should be safe enough to delete (the article also describes a Chrome extension that can safely do that), but as always, make sure you have a backup just in case.  <comment244244> Google will also contain info for Drive You need to give more detail as to the sizes of the subdirectories <comment244247> @Mark I've updated the question with a photo, I don't use Drive, I have Chrome and its extensions, plus AFT for my android phone. <comment244248> The next column split for Default would be useful <comment244252> Updated again :) <comment244268> The solution of clearing browser data didn't actually do anything, the directory is still having the same size as before! I will try the other solution which is making a backup of this directory and then deleting it to see how Chrome will behave. <comment248374> Deleting the directory didn't create any problems, I am doing the same every once and a while, thanks for the solution.
