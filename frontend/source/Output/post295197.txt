How to merge folders and the nested folders and the files according to the time stamp of source object <body> I want to merge folders and the nested folders and the files to specific folder. I have many directories which is same name of a directory but it's under another folder/drive that has many files. So, I want to merge the folders and files according to updated/edited date with the proper time stamp of the files and folders which is not copied date and time by command. Could you tell me how to handle this by command, cp or so on? I failed to do this by rsync command bundled in macOS Sierra that can not keep a time stamp of source file if there is no same file at destination folder and that will be created as new file with the command run date and time.
