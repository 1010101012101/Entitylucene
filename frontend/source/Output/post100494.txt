How do i "restore" my iTunes? <body> I synced my songs and videos etc. from my iphone to my iTunes, except everything else but the things on my phone disappeared from my iTunes. Example: my songs and videos I currently had on my phone are there, but the extra videos I couldn't fit on my phone, as well as the songs I didn't want at the moment were gone, and I can't find them anymore. Is there a way for me to restore the iTunes files that I lost?  <comment118298> Are they missing from the phone or iTunes itself?  Or both?
