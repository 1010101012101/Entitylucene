How to force macOS to accept and activate changes to .GlobalPreferences.plist? <body> I have a key with values that I'd like to insert into code.GlobalPreferences.plist/code. I've been able to insert these via the following steps:  precodemkdir ~/tmp; cd ~/tmp  cp /path/to/some.plist ~/tmp/  cp ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist ~/tmp/ #Convert from binary plist to xml:  plutil -convert xml1 .GlobalPreferences.plist #Merge some values into the plist:  /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c "Merge some.plist :ProperlyNamedKey" ~/tmp/.GlobalPreferences.plist #Test to make sure values have been inserted to key:  /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c "Print :ProperlyNamedKey" #Reencode to binary plist:  plutil -convert binary1 .GlobalPreferences.plist  cp .GlobalPreferences.plist ~/Library/Preferences/  /code/pre  The key and accompanying values are merged fine, but when I codecp/code the .GlobalPreferences.plist back over to the Preferences folder, the changes do NOT show up.  When I codesudo reboot/code the changes also vanish and no longer show up in the .GlobalPreferences.plist nor in codeSystem Preferences/code.  Is there a way to force macOS to accept and activate .GlobalPreferences.plist changes immediaely and such that the attempted changes are not wiped out?  <comment365311> You might try using the `defaults` command to accomplish this. I haven't tested it out myself, but `defaults` is typically used to modify plists from the CLI, so it might work. <comment365313> @GDP2 `PlistBuddy` essentially does that but "better"... I don't think there would be any appreciable difference there in terms of activating the global preferences...
