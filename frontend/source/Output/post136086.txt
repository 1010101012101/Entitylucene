OPEN RECENT FILE command vanished in Word for Mac Office 2008 <body> I am running OS Maverick 10.9.3 on my Mac Book Pro and have worked happily on Office 2008 through several versions of OSX. After a recent "update" by Apple, my "Open Recent Files" vanished from my File pull-down menu. An unfamiliar "Open from Document Connection" now appears there. I have no idea what "Open from Document Connection" means. My "Open Recent File" command was important for me because I work on many multiple projects, and I want that command back. Can anyone tell me how my Open Recent File command vanished and how I can get that back?  <answer136095> That sounds like your Office Preference file got damaged.  Look in Office Preference setting to make sure the show recent files is checked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjMT1.jpg" alt="office recent"  If it is and you still don't see them, the Reset your Office preferences:  There are few procedures available online describing how to, and where the files are stored.  <comment161353> that would be a setting in the MS office preferences.
