Running Lua Code on the Mac? <body> Hey, all.  This is a question that seems painfully obvious and not worth asking all of you, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to run codelua/code code on the mac.  I have a folder full of code.lua/code files that should run to make a simple command-line compression program, and I made sure to install codelua/code using homebrew, so I don't know what I am still missing.  I hope someone knows how to do this, as I can't find anything online to help me.  <answer283544> Now you've installed lua with Homebrew, you can now use the codelua/code command:  precodelua /path/to/file.lua /code/pre  <answer283622> Apple computers come with Lua installed. You might try using that Lua and see if it works. From a terminal window just type lua and there you are.. Hope this works.  <comment357513> I am currently trying that for all the files found in my folder, and I get strange errors in return, so I feel like something else is also missing.  The thing I am trying to run btw is in here, https://github.com/Bulat-Ziganshin/FA Could you potentially try it yourself with those files?
