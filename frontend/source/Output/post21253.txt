Can my Mac tell jokes? <body> Sometimes I just need a break from serious work. Can my Mac OS install tell me any jokes?   <answer21254> Why yes, it can, as a matter of fact. Follow these steps to hear some high quality jokes on your Mac.  ul liOpen up Speech Recognition in your system settings. /li liEnable "Speakable Items"/li liEnable "Speak Command Acknowledgement"/li /ul  Set up the rest however you like (in regards to key press or keyword for input). When you're ready, say "Tell me a joke." (Or, if you have a keyword " tell me a joke".)  Enjoy! (Tested in Lion, although this has been around for quite some time.)  <answer22887> I vaguely recall a way to see (not hear) a joke in Terminal … maybe from before Mac OS X.
