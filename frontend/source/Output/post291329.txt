Corporate Email Changed iPhone Passcode Length <body> My company requires the installation of a config bundle which (amongst other things) forces a 7 digit passcode on the lock screen. Usually the IT department will install the config bundle and get you to enter the new 7 digit passcode.  One of my team members tried to log into their corporate mail via the ios mail app (without installing the config bundle first), her iPhone now has a 7 digit passcode on the lock screen (which she didn't set as it didn't ask her to) and she has locked herself out by getting the fingerprint wrong too many times.  IT department have been completely unable to help. With the phone locked and asking for a 7 digit passcode that she never set, I'm assuming a factory reset (or itunes restore) is the only option?  Not expecting miracles here, would be interesting to see if anyone has seen this before though.  Also, the IT department aren't sure why the passcode length was changed merely by trying to access corporate email; when the phone was unlocked, I couldn't locate the config bundle which we assumed was transferred at the login attempt.  <comment367839> Sounds about right for an IT dept....
