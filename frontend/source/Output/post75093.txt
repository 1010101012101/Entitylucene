Can I sync iTunes with devices that have different Apple IDs? <body> ul liI have: 1 laptop with iTunes and 1 iPod Touch./li liI will have: 2 iPads for my children./li /ul  What I want to do - I will be the one buying apps for their iPads. I have already bought about $40 ready to load on their iPads. I want to be able to easily update their iPads when I get them apps or music. I'm hearing what every one is saying about kids having all their own accounts from start so they don't loose apps and music when they are older.   What I don't want:  ol lithe kids getting all my music from my iTunes./li lito share apps/li /ol  If I create the boys iCloud accounts of their own, can I still sync their devices to my iTunes (under my Apple ID) so I can transfer purchases to their devices?  Or is there a better way to manage this altogether?
