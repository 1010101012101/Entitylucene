Mountain Lion reinstall failure <body> I am trying to fix a Macbook Pro from around 2012/2013, the hard drive failed so I replaced it with a Sandisk 120GB SSD and I am trying to reinstall OS X Mountain Lion using Internet recovery.  Here's what I've done: installed SSD, connected power, Ethernet, booted into Internet Recovery using Command+R, formatted the disk using Disk Utility (Mac os Extended - Journaled), started re-install.  I starts out just fine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQQLR.jpg" alt="Reinstall started"  But then it gets the bar filled, stalls there for long time and the it  pops up with the message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yiyTU.jpg" alt="Reinstall Error"  The error message is in Danish and translates to something like: "Canâ€™t download the additional components needed to install Mac OS X". Does anybody know how to get fix this installation issue?  strongEdit: Attempted suggestion 3) by Keith/strong  Using a Macbook Pro with OS Sierra I got an USB Boot disk created, ran disk utility and started the install, which after about half an hour stopped the installation with the message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQD8a.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Which translates to something along the lines of "The installer payload failed signature check".  strongEdit: Hardware issue and solution/strong  Turns out that something was wrong with the SATA/IR cable connecting the drive to the logic board. Installation succeeded when installing onto the harddrive connected via USB.  I then purchased a caddy and replaced the optical drive with the SSD inside the caddy. It now runs MacOS Sierra just fine.  <answer258549> You're in a slightly tricky situation if you can't get the internet recovery to work.  I would probably try the following (skip any steps you've tried or can't do):  ol liTry the Internet Recovery again using a wired connection/li liCall a nearby Apple store and make an appointment with the Genius Bar/Grove/whatever it's called now to have them install the OS for you (or at least create a bootable USB install drive)/li liAsk a friend/acquaintance at work/school who owns a mac to download the Mountain Lion installer from the app store and use it to create a bootable USB installer drive. You'll need to supply them with a USB drive (8Gb or larger), and possibly buy them a beverage of their choice to say thanks afterwards./li /ol  It is possible to create a bootable OSX install usb drive from windows (google "make osx boot usb from windows" for instructions) emif/em you have downloaded the installer file, but there's no straightforward way to get the installation file if you haven't already.  If you don't have access to a nearby Apple store, then I think your best bet will be to prod your circle of friends/acquaintances until you find one that owns a Mac, and then solicit their help.  <answer258662> Check to be sure that the status of the hard drive is "Verified". Here's how to do that.  ol liIn Recovery Mode, enter Disk Utility./li liIn the left panel, click on the top drive (not the partition)./li liUnder S.M.A.R.T status, check to make sure it says "Verified". If not, either the hard drive is bad somehow or it's corrupted and needs to be formatted/erased./li /ol  <answer259438> It turns out that for some Macbook Pros, it is common for the internal SATA cable to start malfunctioning over time. The errors I experienced does not give a clear indication that this is the case but if others come across this thread and experience spurious installation errors then here are three different ways of getting a Macbook Pro running again:  ol liConnect hard drive via USB/SATA, cost ~12$ and easy but cumbersome to have the drive dangling around, so mostly useful for debugging and determining that it is the internal SATA cable that is malfunctioning./li liConnect hard drive via optical drive caddy, cost ~12$, installation guide https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Early+2011+Dual+Hard+Drive/8529/li liReplace the internal SATA cable, cost ~40$, installation guide: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2012+Hard+Drive+Cable+Replacement/10379/li /ol  <comment323177> Take a look at [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/90458/88313) and see if it helps. <comment323179> @fsb as I understand the answer you are referring to then the solution would be to use a functioning Mac, with Mountain Lion installed, to create a USB installer instead of using internet recovery. Correct? I don't have access to another Mac unfortunately. <comment323322> I used wired connection (ethernet), trying suggestion 3. do you know whether I can install Sierra on a Mac that came with Mountain Lion? I ask since Mountain Lion is not available in the store on the "helper-mac", only Sierra. <comment323523> Must admit I don't know re: installing Sierra directly.  My Macs are both first-gen retina MBPs, bought on release in 2012. If I look in the "purchased" tab of the MacOS app store, I can see the Mountain Lion installer and download it. You might try the same approach on your helper mac. You could also try signing into the app store using your own Apple account details on that mac -- even if the helper mac is newer, you may still be able to download it from there. Note that you can't use the search bar -- you have to scroll through the list and find it manually. <comment323675> Thanks for the input, hard drive is fine, it shows up as "Verified". To further test the hardware I installed Xubuntu and it completed without error.
