Space in Volume Name; can you remove? <body> I have two drives in my machine:  ul liAn SSD with the OS on it/li lia HDD with all my data. /li /ul  I have a symlink on the SSD for my home directory on the HDD so code/Volumes/SSD/Users/Ross//code points to code/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/Ross/code. The codeMacintosh HD/code drive is the original boot disk. I'm trying to get rid of the space in the volume name, but when I do I get all kinds of errors. I thought it was a simple as updating the symlink but it doesn't seem to be.  I tried just option-clicking the drive and renaming, which worked but I started to get a lot of application errors.  For example, Terminal won't even open. Also, a lot of the Ruby gem installers don't handle spaces well.  <answer6972> Yes, you can remove it, but you'd need to Reboot for it to take effect.  I don't recommend renaming it - the vast majority of applications handle the space just fine.   If you have a handful of problematic programs, then just create a soft link to your desired location:  precodesudo ln -s /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Ruby\ Stuff /Ruby /code/pre  <comment7349> Is this your main, boot drive or an external drive? External drives are mounted in `/Volumes/{Drivename}/` <comment7350> I have two drives in the machine, an SSD with the OS on it and a HDD with all my data.

Maybe logging in as another user? <comment8985> I'm having the same type of issue at the moment trying to install some gems.  Unbelievably frustrating.
