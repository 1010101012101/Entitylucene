Cannot format SSD to OS X Extended (Journaled) in order to restore <body> yesterday my computer stayed awake during all night, when I woke up it stopped working. I got many errors, one that says for example that I don't have enough space in my computer even though that when I checked it said I have more than 75 GB available. So  after everything failed I booted in Recovery Mode (Cmd+R) and started playing with it. Currently my state is that my SSD is formatted to exFat because I can format to any kind of filesystem except OS X Extended (Journaled). Also, I can only boot up in Recovery Mode, no OS at the moment. Every time I try to to erase and format to OS X Extended (Journaled) with GUID Partition Map I get this error:  precodeinput/output error: newfs_hfs: write (sector 149512): Invalid Argument  Mounting Disk: Could not mount disk0s2 with name(null) after erase.

Installing to an external dive may also help you determine if it's an issue with procedure or your installer vs the ssd.   <comment293965> Journaled is optional. Can you try the erase again with straight HFS+. Also, you could try installing the OS to an external USB drive to ensure its not a failure of the ssd or connector.
