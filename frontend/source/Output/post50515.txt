I have to use increasing force to push my 'select and drag' feature on my macbook pro. Help? <body> I'm having to use more and more pressure with my right thumb to get the select and drag feature of my trackpad to work.  Is there anything I can do to try to fix this before I have to spend tons of money on a repair?  It may have dog hair in it...  Thank you for any advice!  <comment57943> Does the trackpad work correctly in every other way?
