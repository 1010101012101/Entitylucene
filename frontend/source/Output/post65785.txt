Can't find Trash in Finder or on Desktop <body> I can't find the trashcan icon anywhere.  I'm using OS X 10.7.4. I'm not sure when it went missing.  I can still move items to the trash, but since I can't find it I can't empty it.  Is there a way to get the icons back, or an absolute path to it?  Note: I'm not using Time Machine.  <answer65788> It’s on the right corner of your Dock.  <comment77385> Post a screenshot of your Dock. <comment77386> @duci9y Oops, there it is. I found it. <comment77387> … And you can also empty your trash by choosing `Finder` → `Empty trash…` from the menu bar (when Finder is active, that is).
