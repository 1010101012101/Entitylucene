Get ambient light sensor value from ioreg <body> I'm using the codeioreg/code command line tool to try and read sensor information available on my computer (iMac).  Particularly, I'd like to read the current value of the ambient light sensor.  So far, I have been able to retrieve some general information regarding the sensor via codeioreg -f -b -r -c 'AppleLMUController'/code. But the value is not there:  precode+-o AppleLMUController  &lt;class AppleLMUController, id 0x1000002d8, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 7&gt; {   "IOProbeScore" = 0   "CFBundleIdentifier" = "com.apple.driver.AppleSMCLMU"   "IOProviderClass" = "IOService"   "IOClass" = "AppleLMUController"   "IOMatchCategory" = "IODefaultMatchCategory"   "IOCFPlugInTypes" = {"0516B563-B15B-11DA-96EB-0014519758EF"="AppleSMCLMU.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AmbientLightSensorHID.plugin"}   "IOGeneralInterest" = "IOCommand is not serializable"   "IONameMatch" = "ACPI0008"   "IOPowerManagement" = {"MaxPowerState"=1,"CurrentPowerState"=1}   "HIDServiceSupport" = Yes   "IONameMatched" = "ACPI0008" } /code/pre  I know that there are tools that can use IOKit to access this value using C, ObjC, etc - but I explicitly would like to use a bash one-liner to try and grab the value.    Has anyone been able to successfully do this via the command line and if so, how?  <answer142122> Read the current setting     defaults read com.apple.BezelServices dAuto   Write      defaults write com.apple.BezelServices dAuto -boolean true/false   <comment170506> Doesn't work for me: `The domain/default pair of (.../com.apple.BezelServices, dAuto) does not exist` <comment305310> `com.apple.BezelServices` exists but `dAuto` does not. `dAuto` being boolean suggests that this setting is to turn automatic light sensing off or on rather than to read the value of the sensor.
