How can I delete a file marked as backup item? <body> I'm trying to delete a file, but I get a message from Trash saying:br em"The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified."/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iNuTk.png" alt="The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified."  strongWhat does that mean and how can I delete it?/strong  <answer31758> According to this thread at Apple, this is a bug. This means it will hopefully be fixed in a coming update to OS X.  In the meantime, you have to relaunch the Finder, which you can do either through force quit (⎇⌘⎋, or through the  menu), or by less violent means by quitting it normally, which you must first activate through the following command issued in the Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder QuitMenuItem 1 /code/pre  <answer87500> h2The root of the cause/h2  strongTime Machine backups are protected at kernel level/strong -- on a verbose boot it's possible to spot in the first screenful of text a codeTMSafetyNet.kext/code extension being loaded.      This ensures the integrity of your backups. Access control provisions   are applied via a kernel extension located at   code/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/code   h2Deleting in Time Machine/h2  The officially sanctioned strongmethod for deleting items/strong from a specific backup or all of them is to locate the item in the "in space" Time Machine view and selecting the appropriate delete option from the contextual menu or the Action button in the toolbar.  The ability to move backups to the Trash added in Lion is not only comparatively more buggy, but designed to operate on strongentire snapshots/strong, i.e. the folders named with the time the backup was created which in turn contain a directory for each included volume.  h2Deleting from commandline (more flexible, more control)/h2     There exists a stronga helper program/strong (commandline binary) at...   precode/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/MacOS/bypass /code/pre      ...which allows you to supply a command and argument to completely   bypass the access restrictions.

Entering Time Machine and deleting the file from there was not an option since this backup is linked to another user. However, after deleting the *.exe files using your solution, the Finder would still show them as present. I had to kill the Finder process for the displayed content to refresh. <comment102464> You could always do `killall Finder` in the Terminal <comment102477> Option-click on the Finder's Dock icon and choose Relaunch Finder. <comment164507> This is now moved to: "/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Helpers/bypass", and otherwise works as advertised. <comment249674> In OS X 10.10.5, this is now at `/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass`. <comment339162> trying to use bypass to "mv" the file to a different location on the drive, but it's giving me "Operation not permitted"
