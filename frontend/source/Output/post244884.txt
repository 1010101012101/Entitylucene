Chinese input crashes programs <body> The problem is that when I type in Chinese, the program crashes. It happens in every program (Chrome, TextEdit, Line).  It started shortly after I added Simplified Chinese. I since removed it and also Traditional Chinese and readded, but the problem remains.  Here is the stack trace:  http://pastebin.com/raw/h0RsGM6k  <answer244909> Go to applications/fontbook and do File  Restore Standard Fonts and restart.  <comment301860> Which version of OS X?  Are you talking about the Pinyin IM"s?  Have you added any non-Apple chinese fonts? <comment301861> 10.11.5. No, not talking about Instant Messaging. I may have added non-Apple Chinese fonts - but just tried disabling them all, but the problem still remains. <comment301868> By IM I meant input method.  Are you using pinyin?  Go to applications/fontbook and do File  Restore Standard Fonts and restart.
