Why did my Command + V (to paste) suddenly stop working? <body> Maybe I should be weary every time I do one of these shady Apple updates on my 3-year old Mac running 10.11.5.  Suddenly, the shortcut to paste, kbd⌘ Command/kbd kbdV/kbd, stopped working for me. But all other shortcuts using the kbd⌘ Command/kbd key still work, such as emCopy, Cut, Find, Minimize/em, etc. emPaste/em still works if I do it manually with the mouse by going up to emEdit/em and clicking emPaste/em.    Even when I log into another user, same problem.  And when I am in Recovery Mode, same problem.  And I don't think I have any recent add-ons, as far as I can tell.  I restarted several times and reset my Keyboard in System Preferences. I even tried a few random code stuff in Monitor that I found on other forums. Nothing has worked.  <answer245230> Turn off "Reopen windows when logging in" when restarting. I have had strange things happen with that terrible thing.  <answer270847> This might work but the answer could be you're pasting to much and you should try pasting as piece by piece instead of the whole thing at once.  <comment302284> Does the "V" key still work? <comment302285> Does the Edit menu still show ⌘V beside 'Paste'? It's possible to globally override that (and any other) shortcut, which may have happened unintentionally. <comment302299> Are you using an external keyboard? Bluetooth? I would connect an external keyboard to check your existing hardware. <comment302304> I've used it without issue since its inception. <comment302315> Yes, the "V" key works.   Yes, the Edit menu shows Command + V.    I am not using an external keyboard, and I do not have one handy.  And no, I am not using Bluetooth.    This is very odd. <comment302317> Nope.  That didn't work. <comment302319> @user2720970.  Nope.  That did not work. <comment302339> I am seriously at a loss here. <comment302349> and then it started working again.  at of the blue.   but i would still like some feedback on why this happened.   so weird.   ah, apple. <comment302575> Which applications did you try Command + V in? <comment302788> ALL of them.  as well as logging in as a new user and as well as trying it Recovery Mode. <comment302791> and now double-clicking the top of windows to minimize doesn't work.  but Command + M works.  and the little yellow button in the top-left corner works.   i realize this is an unrelated comment.  but to be honest, i feel it's related somehow. <comment340617> curious.  why would that make a difference? <comment361955> Not an issue. Cmd + V should work regardless of the amount being pasted. <comment362151> _too_ much  might be an answer. <comment362202> @danielAzuelos Thats my point. There *is* no "too much." I've copy-pasted thirty-page documents at once with no issue. Note that paste still works for the OP, just not cmd-v. <comment362249> I agree with you, I meant this is a typical "might be an answer", but not a serious one. <comment362251> Did you install any software which manage or provide  shortcuts?
