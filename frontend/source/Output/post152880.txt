How do I open .icloud files? <body> I'm saving data to iCloud in my app using iCloud Documents capability, however I'm not using the Documents folder, instead I'm hiding my files in another folder i.e. User'siCloudContainer/MyFolder.  I've uploaded some .plist files to this folder but when I receive them using another device they've been given a .icloud extension. What does this mean and how can I get my original .plist files?  EDIT: It seems that these files have been wrapped by NSFileWrapper during cloud synchronisation.  <answer152888> From what I can gather, iCloud Drive doesn't want you to create your own hierarchy &amp; drop files where you like, it appears you're supposed to put them in pre-defined locations...  This was the best layman's explanation I could find as to how it works; I'm not a dev, so the details would need filling in by someone with more knowledge than me.br iCloud Drive and Document Picker for iOS 8: Explained  <answer154131> The answer as I have now discovered is that .icloud files are the metadata that precedes the full file being downloaded to a device.  <comment179997> Thanks for the quick reply! It seems I need to get used to Apple's new system. I thought it would be much the same as the last. <comment180009> I've read this and it doesn't cover what I need. <comment180011> NSFileWrapper is way beyond my pay grade, sorry
