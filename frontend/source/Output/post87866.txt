How to resolve Error 0xE8008001 when sycing iPhone <body> i tried to update my iphone 3gs, and suddenly it lost capacity to connect to a service provider, trying to fix the problem I tried to erase all apps and settings through setting of phone then it hanged on the apple logo.  I took it to a technician who repaired it i dont know how. The problem is that now I can not install any other application as i used to do through itunes showing the error 0xe8008001.  <comment102825> ```0xe8008001``` usually occurs on a jailbroken phone, are you jailbroken? <comment106978> i am also facing this but mine is not jailbroken!!
