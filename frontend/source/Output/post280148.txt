No backlight + no keyboard backlight implies fuse problem? <body> I have a MacBook Air 13" mid 2011.  I have had display problems, so I changed the backlight fuse. After that, there is still no display. The computer works fine otherwise, I can turn it on and hear sounds.   As of now I am wondering whether I soldered wrong, or whether the problem is with the backlight itself.  I also noticed that there is no keyboard backlight. Even if I hit the keyboard backlight keys, it doesn't light up.  I was wondering whether that means that my soldering is wrong, or not. Is the backlight fuse also "protecting" the keyboard backlight ?  <answer280151> The first thing I'd try is resetting the System Management Controller (SMC).  strongReset the SMC/strong  For your model MacBook Air hereâ€™s what you do:   ol liShut down your computer /li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong. /li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd  (on the strongleft/strong side of the built-in keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd /li liLet go /li liTurn your computer back on with the power button. /li /ol  If this has no impact, you can run Apple Hardware Test.  strongApple Hardware Test/strong  Your model MacBook Air uses Apple Hardware Test.

This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Let me know how you go.  <comment352339> It would be impossible to tell if your soldering is "wrong" given that we a) can't see what was done and b) if the fuse was the problem to begin with.  As written, this question is way to broad to even speculate what the issue is. <comment353348> Thanks a lot for your answer and your help ! I have tried resetting the SMC, and it didn't help. I haven't run an Apple Hardware Test yet, since I cannot see anything, and I don't have an external display on hand. I don't know whether that helps, but when I use a flashlight to flash the screen from behind the Apple logo, I do see my desktop, but very faintly and greenish. <comment353349> Well, if you can see your desktop enough by shining a flashlight from behind the screen, I'd do the Apple Hardware Test. There's really not a lot of steps to doing it and it's really something you should do. <comment354357> I mean I can only see a square inch :)
