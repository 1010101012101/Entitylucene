How does pmset repeating events calculate weekdays? <body> Im in a double blind with codepmset/code and repeating events.   codepmset/code will not allow for multiple repeating events, (see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/2660/27252, and http://www.macos.utah.edu/documentation/administration/pmset.html), so Im resorting to the codeschedule/code parameter for the second series of events.   However we need the second event to only occur on weekday mornings codeMTWUF/code, just as the repeating parameter would allow for. Scheduling however requires a date format codepmset schedule wake "07/04/09 20:00:00"/code.  So how can I calculate, perhaps using codePOSIX/code time, the next weekday? How does the bash implementation do it?
