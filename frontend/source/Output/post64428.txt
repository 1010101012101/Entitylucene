AppleShowAllFiles does not show hidden files <body> I use OS X 10.8, I type the following  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES killall Finder /code/pre  but still I cannot see any hidden files like strong.bash_history/strong, strong.Trash/strong, strong.cups/strong, strong.gem/strong etc. in user directory.  <answer64429> Use the code-boolean/code option:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  codeYES/code is not automatically interpreted as a boolean, but as a string.  <answer64481> The bundle identifier is codecom.apple.finder/code in lowercase.  codedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code would also write the setting as a string, but it doesn't usually matter though.  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true osascript -e 'quit app "Finder"' /code/pre  <answer71420> I had this problem. I tried Lauri's solution, and had intermittent success. I found that my particular problem was that I was sometimes running the command from root. Running it from standard permissions proved consistently successful, where running it from root proved consistently unsuccessful.  <answer89348> I have 2 Macs, both running 10.8.3.  I was able to use the  precode defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES /code/pre  suggestion on my Mac Mini with success, but it did not work on the macbook pro no matter how many times (or which method I used) to restart Finder.  When I used the "boolean" method, it worked for the macbook the first time.  The macbook is a 2010 unit, and the mini from 2012, but all that should be only in the OS, and not related to hardware.  very odd, but thanks very much for posting both options.  I was beginning to drive myself crazy trying to see hidden files on the laptop.  I even used "sudo" for the "AppleShowAllFiles" method, thinking it was a permissions thing, but that did not help.  <answer100040> Please use codedefaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles/code to read current status.  Note that strongit's different/strong to use command with root user (e.g. sudo) or standard user and use strongcom.apple.finder/strong with strongFinder/strong in lowercase.  For strongHide hidden/strong files use codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 0/code from current user terminal window emnot/em using codesudo/code or codesudo su/code command.  For strongShow hidden/strong files  use codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1/code  Then relaunch Finder using codekillall Finder/code  Tested on OS X 10.8.4.  <comment75641> no..doesn't work: "Unexpected argument TRUE; leaving defaults unchanged. " <comment75642> @KMC Ok, what about the `-boolean` version? Sorry, I have no 10.8 system on which to test. <comment75643> same error.  I want to go back to 10.6... <comment75645> @KMC Which OS X version are you using, 10.6 oder 10.8? <comment75646> i though my question stated clearly 10.8 (the first line) <comment75722> Oops, @LauriRanta is absolutely right regarding the position of the `-boolean` flag! Lauri, would you prefer to edit my answer (I don't know if it brings you any reputation)? You're also absolutely welcome to write your own answer  :) <comment116581> Worked for me on 10.8.4 <comment117714> You can always edit your own answers.
