How do I stop iDVD from updating assets? <body> I am using iMovie HD (6.0.3) to export to iDVD 7.1.2. If I make any changes to the iMovie project, iDVD asks me if I want to update assets. When I click "Update", all my chapter markers are ruined because they all point to one marker. If I click "Cancel", I can't burn the DVD. I have searched high and low on many different forums, but I haven't found an answer. The only way I've fixed my markers is by 1) Starting the iDVD project over again or 2) Deleting the iDVD .plist file (which really isn't a solution, because once I open the project again, it asks me again if I want to update assets which…………and the process repeats itself again).
