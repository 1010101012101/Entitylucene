TinyUmbrella and other software not detecting my device <body> I have been trying for 8 hours and sorry for bad englando/wording.  I recently found my iPod touch 4G (i think it was running 5.0.1), and tried the passcode too many times, and disabled it (iPod is disabled, connect to itunes).  What I would like to do is bypass that and eventually crack the password, however I am stuck at the first step - getting into DFU mode as my home button doesn't work.   I have tried different versions of TinyUmbrella (32/64 bit) and recboot, but they all don't detect my device - I have tried with 32/64 bit versions of iTunes 10.7-12.xxx and lots of different versions of java, I can't add the device manually to TU either, as you need the iPod to be unlocked to get the UDID afaik.   I have also tried Reiboot (requires you to unlock your device) and redsn0w enter DFU IPSW (requires the iPod to be connected to itunes). It is not a problem with the port, as the iPod charges fine, and when connecting it, iTunes says "iTunes could not connect because it is locked with a passcode..." I plan on bypassing it and cracking it with Gecko.  Thank you so much in advance for any help!
