Play .ogg on command line <body> How can I play a code.ogg/code music file on the command line? On Linux I can use ogg123, but what about on Mac?  <answer89120> You can still use strongogg123/strong through the The Ogg Vorbis CODEC tools, installed through the MacPorts Project.  <comment104584> It's seems good, i installed the vorbis-tools so how i play now? afplay not play and have no command ogg123. <comment104592> On the first link I give you says that there's a configuration argument which is: `--enable-ogg123`. I guess you'll need to use it. <comment104595> understood :), i dont know the macports very well, i try pass the argument like as follow: "sudo port install vorbis-tools configure.args=--enable-ogg123" but dont works, its correctly?
