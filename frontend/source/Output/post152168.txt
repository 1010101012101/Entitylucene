SmoothDraw Alternative to Make Videos like Khan Academy <body> I want to make educational videos like Khan Academy on my Mac. I am looking for a good app that works just like SmoothDraw -- which is what Khan Academy uses. I have found apps that let me draw on the screen using a tablet, however I have not found one that lets me scroll the "whiteboard" down in the way SmoothDraw does.  What app would you recommend as the equivalent of SmoothDraw for the Mac?  <answer167227> Microsoft OneNote works well for me as a more complex software. Optimized for touch also for an easy use with a stylus.
