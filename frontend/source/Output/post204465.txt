Count contents of one column if an adjacent cell matches a query in Numbers <body> I have a spreadsheet maintained in Numbers where I record my practices at the range, which lists type of weapon (pistol, rifle, shotgun), as well as the numbers of shots fired.   I am readily able to calculate the total, but want a more granular overview.  The column recording numbers of shots is called "skudd", while the one recording type of weapon is called type. The formula I've got right now is:  precodeCOUNT(Skudd;COUNTIF(Type;"Pistol")) /code/pre  This should return something over 1500 shots, but currently returns the result 28. The number of times at the range shooting pistol is 18.   <answer204471> Use SUMIF instead of codeCOUNTIF/code. codeSUMIF/code let's you search for a value in one range and accumulate values in another range if a match is found. codeCOUNTIF/code counts the occurrences of a match, which is why you're getting lower than expected results.  Let's say I have two columns: strongType/strong and strongCount/strong. Here's our sample data:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LZEjZ.png" alt="Our Sample Data"  If I want to codeSUMIF/code all the strongCount/strong values when strongType/strong is value codeA/code I'd use:  precode=SUMIF(A2:A7, "A", B2:B7) /code/pre  Doing this for values codeA/code, codeB/code and codeC/code yields the correct results on our simple data set so we can convince ourselves this is what we actually want:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OdIyN.png" alt="The Simple Results"  So, in your case, you'd want to do something like:  precode=SUMIF(&lt;range where you keep gun type&gt;, "Pistol", &lt;range where you keep shots fired&gt;) /code/pre  And that would give you the total shots fired any time you recorded the gun type as codePistol/code.  Note, it's not necessary for the columns to be adjacent, which is nice. But they should have a similar range or odd things can happen.  <comment246458> And there we go; perfect! Thank you!
