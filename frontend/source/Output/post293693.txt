Allowing specific websites/apps at specific times? <body> I've noticed, like many people I suppose, that I tend to get drawn into Facebook/Twitter/Email/News constantly, and once drawn in will often spend an hour or more wasting time in these apps. I've decided to allow myself to check these only during specific time blocks every day, for example Facebook and Twitter from 1pm to 2pm and 9pm to 10pm, email from 8am to 9am and 8pm to 9pm, news from 9pm to 10pm, and so on.  Is there a way to enforce this by blocking such websites/apps outside of these specific time blocks?  <comment370651> You could set up a VPN on your home network that has these restrictions. What device are you using (out of curiosity)? If itâ€™s only chrome you are using as a browser, you can download [Stay Focused](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji) <comment370657> Have a look at this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16320187/programmatically-modifying-parental-controls-on-mac-os-x <comment370947> @bret7600 I'm using Chrome. I'd ideally like something that works on both Mac and iPhone/Android. I've tried Stay Focused, but it only lets you turn on and off ALL restrictions at certain times rather than being able to schedule different restrictions independently, and it's unfortunately less intuitive than I would like <comment370971> Tried [Cold Turkey Pro](https://getcoldturkey.com/pricing/)?
