What's the keyboard shortcut to select the non-default button on a pop-up alert? <body> Look at the screenshot. I want to select the non-blue button with a keyboard shortcut. What is it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9h7TP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer30662> Tab key to navigate the focus between buttons, and press the space bar when a button is selected.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHVq0.png" alt="enter image description here"  The effect is as above image.  When a blue box around a button, press the space bar, the button will be "pressed".  If you found that the focus cannot be set to the button, pen the Keyboard preference, and config it as following: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sEH9s.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer30723> @kukoo is right — also, for many pop-up dialogs, pressing kbd⌘/kbd + kbd&lt;First letter in the button&gt;/kbd works.  That means you could reach the "strongU/strongse .csv" button by pressing kbd⌘/kbd + kbdU/kbd.  <comment35240> I tried the spacebar and it didn't work for this one. <comment35241> That looks like Lion. I'm using SL. And the tab does not work either. <comment35242> Ok I just saw your edit. Working now. <comment114642> Is there a way to do this without full access? <comment114643> This isn't working for me. (On Mavericks beta, so I guess I can't complain.) <comment126942> @Moshe Works for me on "real" Mavericks.
