iPhone 4s does not synch with iTunes 9.2.1 <body> I have iTunes 9.2.1 on a G4 PPC Powerbook and new iPhone 4s (Sept 2012) does not appear in the device list to synch music with Powerbook.  <answer71853> Synching with your iPhone requires iTunes 10.7 or higher, assuming you're running iOS 6+. See this page for more info.  <answer71855> To sync you will need to have an Intel Mac running OS X 10.6 or later  <comment83468> right. That too.
