Problems in OS X with Transmit “Mount to Disk” after Mac upgrade to El Capitan <body> I got a problem in Transmit, after upgrading my Mac to El Capitan (v 10.11). When I tray to "Mount to Disk", I get the following Error:     Internal error (rc=1) while attempting to mount the file system. For now, the best way to diagnose is to look for error messages using Console.   Anyone got a Fix?  <answer208668> This was/is a known issue on transmit 4.4.8 and lower.   Go get version 4.4.9 or later to work around the known issues.  The developer support page here should be updated and the second link is the announcement of the delay:  ul lihttps://library.panic.com/general/mac/el-capitan//li lihttps://twitter.com/panic/status/648970332473192448/li /ul     Quick El Cap Status: Coda mostly works (2.5.12 will bring fixes) — Transmit works — Transmit Disk doesn&#39;t work, but we&#39;re working on it. &mdash; Panic Inc (@panic) September 29, 2015    You can check for updates or get on the developer's email list / watch their blog and twitter account for when they have released a version of Transmit Disk that works with El Capitan. The rest of the normal functionality seems to work for me, just the disk mounting part is needing work.  <comment258469> Fix is now available: "The Transmit Disk feature needs an update to work with OS X El Capitan. You can download Transmit Disk 4.4.9 here." <comment258470> https://download.panic.com/transmit/Transmit%20Disk%204.4.9.pkg <comment304141> I'm having this problem in OS X 10.11.6 with Transmit 4.4.10. Console says ERROR: invalid signature for com.panic.TransmitDisk.transmitdiskfs, will not load. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help. <comment310082> Try Mountain Duck (https://mountainduck.io/) which requires no installation of kernel extensions or FUSE libraries.
