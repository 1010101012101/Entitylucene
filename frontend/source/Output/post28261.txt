Painfully slow to browse large list of subfolders via SMB and/or AFP <body> Having an issue where I have a folder on a QNAP NAS with over 68,000 subfolders within it.  strongI can browse it quickly and almost instantaneously within Windows 7 via SMB, however in OSX 10.6.8 and 10.7.2, it takes nearly 10+ minutes to display the subfolders, using both SMB and AFP./strong  Hoping there is an easy solution - we can't break the folders into smaller subfolders due to a requirement of proprietary software that accesses the sub folders.  I've tried the fixes suggested here, which don't seem to help: http://www.macwindows.com/snowleopard-filesharing.html#030311b  strongHave the same issue browsing the files on a Windows 2003 server, so it is not a NAS issue - rather, it's an issue with how OS X browses over the network.  emPerhaps it is trying to cache all the files/folders before displaying them?/em/strong    Windows 7 doesn't do this, and therefore the subfolders display almost immediately.  <answer42387> I, too, find this a pain with my QNAP box. FYI the firmware has now been updated to 3.6.0 released just a few days ago, and there is some noticeable improvement with the update. However, you may consider using the iSCSI feature among the QNAP settings to make the file shares appear as a hard drive showing up on your desktop for better speed. I've noticed iSCSI works better IMO if your connection to the QNAP is hardwired throughout and not wireless in any way; wireless iSCSI works, just not as fast in my experience.  <answer98272> try to relaunch your finder, some of my colleagues got improve after this. if in same lan, some computer fast and some slow.  <comment33412> What version of the QNAP firmware are you running? The latest firmware has some good fixes for AFP specifically. I've noticed significant increase in speed of access. <comment33491> Thanks - forgot to mention that I'm running the latest v3.5.1 Build1002 <comment35023> Hmm I've got the same firmware and its working fine. Are you able to ssh to it and see if anything is chewing processes ? <comment47021> Have you ever solved this issue? This has been bugging me from day one. <comment47191> @AronRotteveel nope, still appears to be an ongoing problem. <comment115385> Can you add some detail on how Finder can be relaunched without logout/login?
