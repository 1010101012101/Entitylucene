Parental filter which blocks Tarot and other Black magic <body> I am searching for a closed source or open source (MacPorts) internet filtering which blocks Black magic (for example Tarot) web sites.  Very important that this also works with Russian language (example Google query)  Background info: my customer is a Catholic single mom.  <answer98939> In my home, we use a combination of:  ol liOpenDNS filtering./li liLocking down the devices so that the end user cannot change the Internet settings, specifically DNS./li liThe Mobicip browser, which has a free version, but for advanced features such as specific site filtering, costs $9.99 annually./li /ol  I don't specifically filter Black Magic, but there are other things I do block, and these tools allow me to have control over what gets into my network via the Internet.
