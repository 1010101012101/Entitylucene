Google Calendar Refuse Login Password <body> Out of no where the iCal 7 refused to sync with Google by prompting me to input password upon launched.  I tried both Google account password and application-specific password but no availability.  The error log I gotten from the Console are below:     9/9/14 5:35:52.541 PM CalendarAgent[373]:   [com.apple.calendar.store.log.caldav.queue] [Account refresh failed   with error: Error Domain=CoreDAVHTTPStatusErrorDomain Code=401 "The   operation couldnâ€™t be completed.

Anybody can help? Thanks  <answer181946> Go to strongSystem Preferences  Internet Accounts/strong, remove your emGoogle/em account and add it back again.  emWARNING: This operation will eliminate all the data related to your account stored in your computer and will download a fresh copy (email, contacts, messages, etc.)/em  <comment170394> Could you take the time and CLEAN up that Console copy/paste. It is unreadable the way it is now.
