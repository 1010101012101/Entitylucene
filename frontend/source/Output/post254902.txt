ssh -A stopped working in macOS Sierra and keychain is not unlocked at login <body> After upgrading, codessh -A/code no longer works. Uncomment codeForwardAgent no/code line the code/etc/ssh/ssh_config/code and change codeno/code to codeyes/code does not seems to work. This is extremely annoying. In addition, my Mac is password protected.   Previously, after I login, I never needed to enter the password for ssh once I selected something like "unlock keychain for ssh on login", years ago. I don't remember the exact message. I only needed to do it once for every mac I ever owned. However, it now prompts for password when I need to access ssh id_rsa, such as using codegit/code. I deleted the login item in the keychain, and the next time I restarted, try to use ssh, the password prompts appears again, but no prompt asking me if I want the keychain to remember and unlock the key.   Can anyone help or at least explain what changes are made for ssh in the new OS.  strongEdit/strong To answer my own question, codessh-add -K/code seems to do the trick.  <answer256813> It seems that the ssh keys are not loaded by default into ssh-agent.  This solved the issue for me:  Edit your ssh config  precodevi ~/.ssh/config /code/pre  Add the following  precodeHost *     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa     AddKeysToAgent yes     ForwardAgent yes /code/pre  Find out more information on reddit discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/52zn5r/difficulties_with_sshagent_in_macos_sierra/  <answer257595> The answer above works for RSA Keys, but once I had a DSA key, the solution had an additional step. Add the key using  precodessh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_dsa /code/pre  Then, edit or create the file ~/.ssh/config with the following content:  precodeIdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss /code/pre  After saving this file it should work.  <answer259827> Sierra is now using OpenSSH 7.0 which has deprecated DSA keys.  If you need to use DSA keys still, add the following to the top of your ~/.ssh/config  precodeHost *     PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-dss* /code/pre  <comment317454> Please don't append answer in your question!
