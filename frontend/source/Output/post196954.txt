iTerm2 preferences keep resetting after reboot <body> My changes to the preferences in iTerm2 are always reset after a reboot. They will survive a logout, but after a reboot everything is back to the previous state. I checked code~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist/code and my user is file owner and also has write access. Does anybody know how to fix this?  I remember reading that Yosemite is protecting codeplist/code files somehow. Could this be the cause? I'm on 10.10.4.  <answer199458> Well. I did not find the cause for the issue (although it was quite obviously some file permissions problem). But this is how I fixed it:  ol liQuit iterm2/li liMove code~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist/code to the Desktop/li liReboot (because plist files are protected) /li liLaunch iterm2 and quit it again to create a new plist file/li liOpen code~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist/code in an editor/li liPaste the contents of the plist file on the Desktop into the new one/li liReboot/li /ol
