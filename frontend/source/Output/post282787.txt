Unexpected shutdown and unknown service in MacOS <body> My Mac was sitting idle and the lid was open and when I checked it after one hour, I found the Mac was shutdown. I was sure that there was battery available before I left it. I tried to start it again by pressing the power button but it was not starting. So I kept the power button pressed and then it was started.  After I logged in, I saw a message strongYou shut down your computer because of a problem./strong and I hit the strongOpen/strong button to reopen my Mac.  I tried to find out the cause for half an hour but nothing helpful. How can I check the problem of my last unexpected shutdown?  I already went through various links like https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT200553.  Also, when I'm seeing my system logs, my log is full of a repetitive log:  precodeMay  5 04:47:58 Shashanks-MacBook-Pro com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.yourcompany.My_Connection[90818]):     Service could not initialize: Unable to set current working directory. error = 2: No such file or directory, path = /Applications/My Connection.app: 16E195: xpcproxy + 11207 [1386][C3029DF2-7E5A-31CF-9487-099C1A6F825A]: 0x2 /code/pre  I verified my applications and I don't see any such application but I somewhat remember installing an application and later removed it.  When I ran codelaunchctl list/code I'm seeing various processes with status 0 but this service having status code78/code img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/77RRi.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is that service causes my system failure or how can I check the reason of the failure?  I'm using strongMacBook Pro/strong with strongMacOS Sierra 10.12.4/strong. strongUpdate 1/strong  Found the codecom.yourcompany.My_Connection.plist/code at code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code with content:  precodebplist00�    _WorkingDirectoryYRunAtLoadXOnDemandULabelWProgram_/Applications/My Connection.app  _com.yourcompany.My_Connection_'/Applications/My Connection.app/Running&amp;09?Gijk�� /code/pre  strongUpdate 2/strong  Running the command codelog show --style syslog --predicate 'eventMessage contains "shutdown cause"'/code as suggested by @Allan gives the output:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wODab.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment356387> Possible duplicate of [Sierra Console.app show earlier data](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/278393/sierra-console-app-show-earlier-data). More specifically, refer to my answer for an explanation of what you can do. <comment356388> [MY CONNECTION](https://www.iboostup.com/app/com.yourcompany.my_connection) - [MyConnection Server v10](http://www.myconnectionserver.com/index.html) - Hard to say: suspicious? You probably have to remove a com.yourcompany.My_Connection.plist file in /Library/LaunchAgents,  /Library/LaunchDaemons or ~/Library/LaunchAgents. <comment356389> Not only suspicious, it caused an error.  The exit status is `78` which means it generated an error.  That *could* be the reason for the crash, but you will have to do some detective work.  See if you can find the `.plist` associated with that service.  It's either in `~/Library/Launch Agents`, `/Library/LaunchAgents`, or `/Library/LaunchDaemons`  If you find it, see what the `.plist` contents are by opening up in an editor. <comment356396> Thanks @Monomeeth Got your point about the logging & historical data <comment356397> Wohhh! @klanomath I literally didn't googled `com.yourcompany.my_connection` I should have googled it first before raising :( but I remember installing an application with that logo. I'll search in launch agents <comment356398> @Allan updated the answer with the `plist` file content. Shoudl I remove that directory? Removing directly is safe or should I remove via `launchctl remove` command? <comment356399> @ShashankAgrawal 1. `launchctl unload -w ~/Lib*/LaunchA*/com.yourcomp*.plist` 2. `launchctl remove ~/Lib*/LaunchA*/com.yourcomp*.plist` 3. `rm ~/Lib*/LaunchA*/com.yourcomp*.plist` <comment356400> Done, thank you @klanomath <comment356401> My Mac's temperature was a bit high today, can that be the reason of shutdown? <comment356409> Removing that file should help.  To see if you can find your shutdown cause, issue this command `log show --style syslog --predicate 'eventMessage contains "shutdown cause"'`  It should give you a code as to why it was shutdown.  We can then use that to start searching. <comment356470> @Allan I updated the question with the screenshot of the output of the command you suggested. The highlighted one is the time when my system was rebooted. I checked the status code https://georgegarside.com/blog/macos/shutdown-causes/ here and like I mentioned in the question I had to hard restart the Mac by keep pressing the power button. <comment356473> Cause 5 is a clean shutdown and a 3 is a hard shutdown as if you held the power button.  Since removing that file, is it shutting down? <comment356474> No, it didn't shutdown after removing that file and that was the first incident when my Mac was shudown unexpectedly.
