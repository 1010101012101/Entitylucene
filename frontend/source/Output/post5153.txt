Why don't I have a camera on my iPod touch? <body> Why do a couple of my friends have a camera on their iPod touch and I don't?  <answer5155> As far as I know, only the 4th gen iPod touch has a camera. Yours is probably older.  As you can see from the specifications published on Apple's site, there are no mention of a camera for the third gen iPod touch, while the fourth gen has detailed information about it.  <answer5236> Only the 4th generation iPod Touch has cameras, that is the iPod Touch that was introduced back in September. The iPod Touch you have is either a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation, which means it doesn't have the camera.  <comment5247> They also have a better screen, the fabled retina display... <comment5248> two cameras, right? <comment5255> Yes, there is a back camera and a front camera.
