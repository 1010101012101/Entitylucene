Which versions of MacOS/OSX is the voice "Victoria" available on? <body> Is there a way to find out what versions of OSX/MacOS shipped with which voices?  <answer271474> I do not know if Apple has published a list however having just now checked the installers (DVD's shipped in USA and Install App's downloaded from App Store in the USA) from Tiger to Sierra, Victoria is in all of them.   <answer271478> Victoria is present in every Mac OS X/OS X/macOS version. The oldest reference I've found is from 1991 though and it was already available in System 7 (MacinTalk 3/MacinTalk Pro).  <comment341241> Can confirm it's present on Sierra and Snow Leopard.
