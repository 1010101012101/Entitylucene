How do you Unzip a folder into “C:\…\arduino-1.0.4\arduino-1.0.4\hardware <body> I have been working on making my Arduino pro micro work, and i have been following a few tutorials  https://coytar.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/use-arduino-uno-as-an-avr-isp-to-burn-the-bootloader-to-a-sparkfun-pro-micro-5v/  This one tells me to:  precodeUnzip that folder into “C:\…\arduino-1.0.4-windows\arduino-1.0.4\hardware”. /code/pre  I know the windows part in inaccurate. But how do i unzip the folder i was instructed to download into the mac equivalent of this:  precodeUnzip that folder into “C:\…\arduino-1.0.4-windows\arduino-1.0.4\hardware”. /code/pre  i don't even know what this means or where i would start, if anyone can help  Thank you!  <answer272950> Open Terminal  precodecd /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware unzip ~/Downloads/Arduino_Boards-master.zip /code/pre  (Assuming you download and install to the default paths) If the directory isn't there, run  precodecd /Applications/Arduino.app find . -name "hardware" /code/pre  Good luck  If you get really lost, you always have the option to install the Arduino IDE under WINE and go to ~/.wine/drive_c/arduino-1.0.4\arduino-1.0.4\hardware ;)  <comment343119> Thank you very much if i run in to a problem i will come back! <comment343120> how do i check if it works?? <comment343121> You're welcome. It's really late here in Europe so I'll go sleep in a few minutes so don't be surprised. Good luck. <comment343122> Run unzip with the -v option to see progress. <comment343129> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/53589/discussion-on-question-by-sergei-glimis-how-do-you-unzip-a-folder-into-c--ard).
