OS X Yosemite installation error: File system verify or repair failed <body> My Mac has been running fine until I decided to upgrade to OS X 10.10, Yosemite. When it is installing I get the message:     File system verify or repair failed.    I clicked the restart option to boot into my internal HD but tells me its unavailable. I then rebooted, held kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd to enter disk utility in order to repair the disk, but it tells me it failed and should backup and restore the HD.  I then tried to create an image on my external drive but this also fails with the message:     Unable to create Macintosh HD.dmg. (Input/output error)   I am stuck in this vicious cycle of restarting and the installation failing. I cannot escape the installation process.  Is there a way to access my files and copy them onto my external HD, then erase and restore the internal HD?  <answer160025> You could try booting off a Linux LiveUSB to back up your files.  Once that is done, you can reformat your HD and then reinstall OS X.  You should also keep an eye on your HD; these types of errors often suggest that your drive is corrupted or damaged.  <answer160075> Have you got access to another mac? Your best bet would be to connect other mac using target disk mode, either via firewire or thunderbolt. Your internal drive will show up on the desktop of the other mac for you to copy off your files.  Other option would be booting up via an other system via an external drive, open disk utility and try to repair a couple of times. Soon or later your internal drive will pop up on the desktop so you can recover your files. But I stress I need an external hard drive or USB key drive with a OS X system on it to do this.  It's sounds like your hard drive is dying basically, hence why Disk Utility can fix/repair for you to install Yosemite.  What mac are you running?  <answer160125> ol liAttach your thumb-drive and copy all contained files &amp; folders to your external drive, then start codeDisk Utility/code./li liCopy codeInstall OS X Yosemite/code to your external drive/li liChoose your thumb drive in the left pane and repartition it to 1 Partition, click the codeOptions/code-button, choose codeGUID Partition Table/code and kbdOK/kbd, then kbdApply/kbd  /li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uj1C0.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EhNCd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="4" liQuit codeDisk Utility/code and open codeInstall OS X Yosemite/code  /li liInstall Yosemite to your thumb drive.

You need additional free space there in the size of your Windows partition if you want to copy that also. Before starting the copy open codeDisk Utility/code and unmount the partition codeSystemInternalDrive/code and possibly codeWinSystem/code then quit codeDisk Utility/code.  Now enter in codeTerminal.app/code:    precode  sudo dd bs=512 if="/dev/rdisk0s2" of="/Volumes/ExternalDrive/RescueMac.dmg" conv=noerror,sync /code/pre  hit kbd↵/kbd, enter your password (it will not be visible) and hit kbd↵/kbd again to copy your internal Mac volume to an image file on your external disk though it contains errors. The input file (if) is the codeDevice Indentifier/code of the corrupted partition found in the codediskutil list/code output above prepended by code/dev/r/code hence code/dev/rdisk0s2/code.br This will take a good while. If you enter a higher value for bs it should be faster. Using 512 i got 4 MB/s, using 524288 (1024x512) i got about 65 MB/s (but strongwasn't/strong successful copying my thumb-drive finally). Often a larger integral multiple of 512 is recommended (e.g. 4096 bytes=(8x512)).   If you also want to copy your boot camp partition that might work:  precode  sudo dd bs=512 if="/dev/rdisk0s4" of="/Volumes/ExternalDrive/RescueWindows.dmg" conv=noerror,sync /code/pre/li liAfter the process is finished enter codeexit/code and hit kbd↵/kbd, quit codeTerminal/code, open your external disk with the Finder and open the newly created RescueMac.dmg file.

Do you use TimeMachine to back up your main (internal) drive? <comment188114> I can't recall off the top of my head how much I have available but its fairly new so should be plenty. I do have a bootcamp partition though. I have done a number of backups with TimeMachine however when I go into disk utility and TimeMachine it just got stuck on the searching timemachine back up. <comment188116> is there a way of going into safe mode and obtaining the files I need? <comment188121> Yes, but you have to restart into recovery mode to accomplish that. You may create an image of your internal disk ignoring those errors. But knowing the sizes/free space is essential for this. Restart into recovery mode and open `Disk Utility` choose the different disks/partitions and make notes of their sizes and the free space of your external disk and then post it here. <comment188150> Be sure to unplug all external devices when you reboot. <comment188161> Ok so I have looked at my partition I have a lot less on my Internal HD than I thought (I used a FireWire cable to transfer data from an old Mac when I got this one). On my internal HD I have used 230 gb and have 48 available. On my external HD I have 400gb available <comment188171> Yes I have an old 2009 model which I don't currently have on me I'm working away from home. I'm trying to repair the HD again. What do you mean pop up in my desktop? As in show as a start up disk? Is there anything I can do from the bootcamp partition side of things because that's working fine <comment188185> @LaurenRoss Do you have an empty thumb drive and if so how big is it? How do you try to install Yosemite?  Recovery Mode-Reinstall OS X? Or do you use a thumb drive to install it? <comment188186> Yes I have a usb with 64 gb. I installed it through my machitosh HD. So far I have created a startup disc on my external hard drive and I can now access the files I want from the Macintosh HD. I have 44 gb of pictures that I want to save. What's the best way to do this? The rest I am not too bothered about saving such as music as they are backed through icloud. <comment188202> @LaurenRoss Please add `@klanomath ` to your comment. Then i will get a hint that someone responded on my comment. Otherwise i have to navigate to your question every once in a while to check for new responses. I will write an answer to your original question soon. To answer the question in your comment please start the app Terminal in /Applications/Utilities/ and enter "df" (without quotes) hit the enter key, copy and paste the output to your question (you may edit your question!). Do the same again with "diskutil list". Maybe it's even better to ask a 2nd question here. <comment188491> Thanks so much for this it worked a treat. I was just about it take it to an apple store before you posted this! You saved me time and money. Will be purchasing a new internal HD ASAP. Once my new internal HD is up and running will it be safe to change my external HD back to fat32 format? <comment188527> @LaurenRoss What's the purpose of the external disk? <comment188773> Kudos for this amazing blog post. Well done @klanomath
