Safari reopens last open tabs? <body> On Lion, if I quit Safari using kbd ⌘ Command/kbd+kbdQ/kbd and then restart it, it reopens all tabs from last time.  In Preferences, I have set that new Windows open with an Empty Page, a setting that worked fine in Snow Leopard.  Is there a way to disable that nonsense? I can't seem to find a setting for this :(  <answer18008> This is a new feature in Mac OS X Lion. See here (Resume).  You can disable this in codeSystem Preferences &gt; General/code and untick the "Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps, but will be system wide.  Another solution is to hold kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbdQ/kbd when quitting,  the app will then not save the state.  <answer29871> In addition to the great kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbdQ/kbd tip, another way to think about it: If you always close all your tabs (kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbdW/kbd) before you quit, there won't be any state to save. Then when you restart Safari, you'll get your preference of a blank page, home page, etc.  <answer29873> In case you didn't have the foresight to shut down with a special command, you can always hold down kbdShift/kbd when starting Safari (or any other Resume-able app) to prevent it from restoring the previous state.  <answer54859> Note that as per this other answer to a similar question, is is actually possible to disable resume on a per-app basis, forcing Safari to start with a new window and as such take your 'empty page' preference into account.  <comment34291> The setting in can be overridden for individual apps with something like `defaults write com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false`.
