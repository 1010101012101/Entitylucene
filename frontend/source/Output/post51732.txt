copy song info from mp3 file to aac file from terminal <body> I am trying to create a script that performs various conversions between formats of audio files. In one particular step, I use afconvert in Terminal to convert an mp3 to aac(mpeg4/m4a), but in this process all of the info attached to the audio file (name, artist etc) is lost. I tried to id3cp to copy over the info but this doesn't work (I think because aac files don't use ID3 tags...).  Could someone suggest a way of copying all of the associated info on the mp3 files to the aac (m4a) file? Is there a way it can be retained during the conversion (preferable) or alternately a Terminal command to copy the info over?  <answer53623> I prefer the mutagen Python library for tag editing, since it has good support for a wide variety of formats with a consistent interface. Hereâ€™s a script for copying the metadata of a file:  precodeimport mutagen import mutagen.easyid3 old = mutagen.easyid3.EasyID3('example.mp3')  new = mutagen.File('example.m4a')  new.update(old) new.save() /code/pre  You can open any file with codemutagen.File/code, but that gives you raw access to the coded ID3 tags like code'TPE1'/code, instead of human-readable tags like code'artist'/code, so codeEasyID3/code is used instead.  <comment173837> Even better, create a small executable python script with the above code. You can use the argparse library to create a commandline interface for your tag copier.
