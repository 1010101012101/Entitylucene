Notes format from Mountain Lion (V1) to Mavericks (V2): how to migrate? <body> My previous Mac's hard drive died, but I had backups, so I am migrating all its data to a new Mac. The only problem: my previous computer had Mountain Lion and the new one has Mavericks, so the data in the Notes app seems to be stored in a different format. In my backup, I see the notes in:  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes /code/pre  And I see these files:  precodeNotesV1.storedata NotesV1.storedata-shm NotesV1.storedata-wal /code/pre  In my new computer, in Mavericks, I see the notes in the same path, but the files are:  precodeNotesV2.storedata NotesV2.storedata-shm NotesV2.storedata-wal /code/pre  So, is there any difference between V1 notes files and V2? Can I just overwrite them with my old note files?  <comment231205> If you're actually migrating, presumably it will figure it out. If you're just copying, I wouldn't be so sure. It might offer to update on first launch... <comment231208> Well, I am using the word "migrate", but in truth I'm not using Migration Assistant or anything like that; as I said, my previous Mac died, so I'm copying everything from backups by hand.
