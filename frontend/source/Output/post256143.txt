How do I scale everything up on my Mac Screen without decreasing resolution? <body> Most forums I found on Google mentions that the easiest way to zoom things up on a Mac Display is to set the resolution lesser. But, that just strongstretches/strong the lesser resolution screen leading to strongblurry/strong visuals.   I'm in fact searching for something on Mac like this which is offered on Windows PCs  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MebpS.png" alt="enter image description here"     How do I do that having the same resolution set?   PS: This question is similar to this post except that I want everything (including top bar, icons, everything literally) unlike just changing the font size  <answer256161> Essentially this is only available on the newer Macs with Retina display.  They have a slider similar to that in Windows with four or five different sizing levels (more data (more content, small text), more detail (less content)).   Also, there is a similar topic on Stackoverflow Simulate HiDPI via Quartz Debug but I'm not sure how useful this is in every day situations.  <answer256198> On retina Macs it is in System Preferences  Display (see this article). Switch it to "scaled" and it should show multiple choices that look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MxQL4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment319330> I've searched for this same thing but as the answers to the other question also state, I don't think this ability exists as a built in option. <comment319350> sliders, where? Where do I find them?
