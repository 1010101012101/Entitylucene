Add spotlight indexing for CSV files <body> On my system (Mountain Lion) Spotlight doesn't do a full-text search for comma-separated values, but I can search them with Spotlight if I rename them to .txt for example.  Is there a way that I can get full-text search in .csv files with Spotlight as well? It doesn't need to be smart (ie. guess the field separator or anything), the behavior I get when I rename to .txt would be just fine?  Other search apps are of course an option, but right now that feels overblown.
