iPhone 6 upgrade, restore missing photos? <body> I just upgrade to my iPhone 6. I first made backup (to iCloud) on my iPhone 5, then i restored it on the iPhone 6. Now all works well and everything is there, strongexcept all/strong my photos.  Anybody has a handy tip to restore strongall/strong my photos from my iPhone 5?  <comment177427> Yes i did, there is only last month. All the previous months (and years) are not there. Its almost like it didn't full restored... <comment177428> maybe have a look at http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4605 <comment212772> Was your iPhone set to sync photos with iPhoto. In that case I believe it gets excluded from the backup.
