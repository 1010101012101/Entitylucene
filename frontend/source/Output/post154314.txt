Why did I receive a text message on my Mac prior to my iPhone? <body> Since the Yosemite and iOS 8.1 updates, we can now receive our non-iMessages (SMS) messages on our Mac (more info).  However, the following strange scenario happened to me:  ul liI was using my Mac and my iPhone — just near me — was locked,/li lithe Message Mac app notifies me of a text message from my friend's phone (definitely not an iPhone user),/li li1 minute later, my iPhone vibrates and finally notifies me of the same text message./li /ul  Since my iPhone is the first and only device to get the text message from my cell phone provider, why did my Mac notify me first?
