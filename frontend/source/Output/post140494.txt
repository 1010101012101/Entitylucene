Secure erase OS X disk via terminal <body> If there's an encrypted (filevault) volume, both of these methods in terminal will erase the given drive. However, what differences exist between the two? Which is more secure?  Option 1:  precodediskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Macintosh\ HD disk22 /code/pre  Option 2:  precodediskutil cs list // find logical volume group UUID diskutil delete *UUID* /code/pre  <answer140495> I think the most secure way is to use codediskutil zerodisk/code and then follow up with either command. Both of those commands remove the reference to logical structure on the disk but a good file recovery tool would still be able to recover most material on the unstructured volume by matching file templates to successive sets of bits. You want to write over everything with 0s or garbage before you dereference the volume.  strongUPDATE/strong: It was negligent of me not to mention that codediskutil secureErase/code also exists and it combines the two commands with options for multiple passes of zeroing the disk.
