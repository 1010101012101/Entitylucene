How do I add/adjust words in/to the keyboard dictionary on iOS? <body> I want to add some common building names for my college campus to my keyboard dictionary, but in the General tab in Settings, I only see an option to reset the dictionary.  I tried typing the words, expecting to see a red squiggly underneath them and then an option to add the words to the dictionary, but only a suggested edit was there.  It added one of the buildings =, but only because it tried to auto-correct to something else but I corrected it and it added itself to the dict.  But other names that have no auto-correct don't get added.  Also, I want to adjust a word that was added by making it auto-correct to being capitalized. And I want to remove some of the autocorrects like correcting "te" to "the" instead of the preprogrammed "TE", etc.  <answer62510> ol liGo to Setttings  General  Keyboard./li liTap Edit in the top right corner./li liTap Add New Shortcut. Type the word you wanted to add to the dictionary in the Phrase field. You can also optionally add a shortcut./li liAdd a shortcut with the Phrase TE and the shortcut te. This will auto-capitalise te to TE. It will also prevent it from auto-correcting to the./li /ol  <comment72203> I was just writing the same thing! Thanks duci9y <comment72204> You’re welcome. <comment72207> Actually, I wanted to do the opposite of what you mentioned for TE. I want it to correct to the instead of TE. But the method is the same! Thanks! I didn't think this was the user dictionary, I thought it was a shortcut or something, but I guess they do the same things. <comment72208> You’re welcome.
