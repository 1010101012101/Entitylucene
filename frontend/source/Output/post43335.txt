Why doesn't tap-clicking work often in Flash? <body> In a few situations in Flash, tapping to click doesn't work, while mechanically clicking does. (Tap-clicking is of course turned on.) It's in some cases a Flash game, and in some cases Hulu or another video site. Why doesn't tapping work, and why emdoes/em clicking work?  My guess is that it has something to do with whatever the Flash equivalent is of "mouse emdown/em" versus "mouse emclicked/em."  <answer43791> It's probably about that Flash object's design/development.  I haven't used Flash for development in a long time, but it must have attributes for allowing/disallowing such things. And since every developer behaves differently you are experiencing different things like that.  <comment49771> When you say "tapping", what input device are you referring to? A Magic Trackpad? <comment49774> The "tap to click" feature doesn't mean a different thing as far as programs are concerned thoughâ€”as far as a program can tell, a click and a tap are the same thing. The OS interprets the user's input. <comment49775> @djacobson The trackpad on my MacBook Pro.
