How do I force OSX to always save file extension? <body> When saving a file without an extension not even OS X is able to open that file anymore. Still it is very easy to accidentally save a file without an extension. Example: When using Firefox and you save an image with the "Save image as..." context menu, the whole filename including the extension is marked for renaming and as soon as I entered a custom name the extension is gone and I have to reenter it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DBY3Z.png" alt="Screenshot: Save As... menu from Firefox" strongHow do I solve this problem?/strong  <answer178208> You can hide common filename extensions, so in the save dialog no filename extension will be shown. In a finder window, open preferences from codeFinder/code menu. Uncheck codeShow all filename extensions/code.  <answer178216> Apparently this is the way Firefox handles the "Save as..." action. When using Chrome or Safari  there is no issue.  There is a bug report since 2008, but the status is still 'NEW'.  The only solution I see at the moment is to select the name (strongunnamed/strong.png) and only edit that part in the text area.  <answer178221> Another option...  Where the option exists to strongSave As/strong you can always drag images directly to your desktop, or to a folder on your dock (assuming Firefox isn't running fullscreen). The dragged files are saved complete with their file extensions. This would offer an immediate workaround to your problem until Firefox's save behaviour is corrected, assuming the devs ever get around to fixing it...  <comment211050> Thank you.While that is a valid option, I need to see file name extensions. <comment211063> When I leave the file name untouched, there would not be a problem. I could just click "save". But thank you. <comment211064> It's the workflow I've adopted for precisely this reason - renaming files *after* saving them gives you the option in Finder to undo a name change, should you need it, and you don't have the overwritten extension issue. Dragging is also considerably quicker than right-clicking, going to the Save As menu item and then confirming the save location. Works for me anyway...
