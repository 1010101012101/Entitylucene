Disable auto suggest typing when using the CTRL key <body> Sometimes when I press and release the CTRL key while my cursor is in a text field, the letter "I" gets inserted and an autosuggest list gets opened.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F3FEK.png" alt="enter image description here"  I really really dislike this because I often press and release the CTRL key without wanting to type anything.  How can I disable this functionality?  <answer261067> As noted in another answer:  It's the auto completion from the built in spell checker and after a lengthy search I found the solution in Apples Discussion Forums:  precodedefaults write -g NSUseSpellCheckerForCompletions -bool false /code/pre  Afterwards restart affected programs and Esc just cancels searches again.  <comment189678> Do you have CTRL mapped to also do Escape when pressed and released? <comment189872> No. The only keyboard item I have changed is mapping Caps Lock to Escape using Karabiner. <comment190089> @CoryKlien: Do you have Caps Lock mapped to Control with Seil or System Preferences? It's possible that you actually have CTRL mapped to both CTRL and Escape, then Caps mapped to CTRL.. <comment190300> Turns out I actually did have CTRL mapped to Escape in Karabiner, somehow I missed it before! It was only mapped to Escape if I pressed and released CTRL without hitting any other buttons.
