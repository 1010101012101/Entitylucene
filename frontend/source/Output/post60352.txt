How do you cancel an automatic connection to a once joined wi-fi network on 10.7.4? <body> I wish to no longer log on automatically to a wi-fi network that I once logged on to access the internet.  I have tried everything in the advanced tab of the Network preference panel to no avail: the computer never "forget" the WEP password no matter what I do.   Any further reaching solutions I would not be aware of?  THanks.  Paul  <answer60355> ol liGo to System Preferences  Network./li liSelect your Airport/WiFi connection on the left./li liClick on the "Advanced..." button in the lower right of panel./li liYou should see a list of "Preferred Networks." Select the one you want to "forget" and click the minus "–" button below./li liYou can also un-check "Remember networks this computer has joined" – that will cause the computer to – you guessed it – NOT remember networks it has joined! :-)/li /ol  <answer60374> Check if the wi-fi password is saved in the Keychain (Applications - Utilities - Keychain Access.app), if you haven't changed any Keychain settings, it should be in the "login" keychain, look for an entry with codeName/code the same as the wi-fi network name and codeType/code Airport network password. If there is such entry, delete that entry (click on the entry corresponding to the wi-fi network, then Edit - Delete, or right-click - Delete). Make sure that you don't delete the whole codelogin/code keychain.   <comment69484> Thanks. Tried it many times. Doesn't work.
