Groups windows into tabs osx <body> Is there an app or something that will allow to create tabs for any App? For example on the left half of my screen I have a web browser and on the right half of my screen I have a text editor and finder (both fill up 50% of the screen, one is behind the other). I'd like to have a Chrome-like tab bar that lets me quickly switch between the text editor and Finder.  Is there anything like this out there?
