Stop holiday/christmas/spoken word from playing in iTunes DJ? <body> Whilst I like Herb Albert and his Marijuana Brass Band dropping a christmas phat one, I don't appreciate it when it's July  How can I prevent them from appearing in the playlist?  <answer39248> Make a playlist that includes all your Christmas songs.  Then in all your other playlists, explicitly exclude the Christmas playlist. The DJ can pull from a playlist that isn't the "holiday" mix.   <answer39251> I have added a comment code[xmas]/code to all my christmas songs and use this tag to exclude songs from playlists. For iTunes DJ I created a list containing all songs without the tag and used this list as basis for iTunes DJ.  PS: This of course only works if you don't use the comment field for something else.
