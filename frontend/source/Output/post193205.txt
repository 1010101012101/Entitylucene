Application permissions for Standard user <body> I use my Mac as a Standard user. When I first set it up, all applications were downloaded/installed using the Admin user. Running latest OSX 10.10.3  When using my Mac as the Standard user, every time I go to run an application I get the following message:  precode"Whatever.app" is an application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it? /code/pre  With the options for codeCancel/code and codeOpen/code. Of course I choose codeOpen/code and everything works fine.  Now, I am used to this notice appearing the emfirst/em time I try to run an app from the internet. My problem is that it appears emevery/em time.  Note that I am not asked for any Administrator credentials, and these apps have already been installed to the code/Applications/code directory as an Administrator.  I have tried with a different Standard user and still have the same issue. I have also already used Disk Utility to repair the drive permissions, just in case.  How can I make this notice appear only on the first run?  ==========================================================  I found another "clue". If I install an application, emwhile logged in as the Standard user, but authenticating as the Administrator,/em then it only warns me about the Application on the first run, and then never again, emas long as I am still logged in as that Standard user./em  But all the applications I installed emwhile logged in as Administrator/em give me a pop up warning emevery time/em if I try to run them emwhile logged in as a Standard user./em There must be a way to fix this.  ==========================================================  strongUPDATE/strong  strong"Solution"/strong: For every application I downloaded and installed, while logged in as Administrator, simply installing the application is not enough. I must actually login as the Administrator and launch the application at least once to clear the warning for all other users. This seems incredible silly. I'm glad I found a "fix", but surely there must be a better way to accomplish this?   <comment230152> Is this before or after reset ACLs? <comment230164> OS X uses the com.apple.quarantine attribute on the application bundle, as well as the database entries stored in "~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2" to determine whether or not to show that message. You can try running `sqlite3 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2 .dump|grep -i LibreOffice` replacing LibreOffice with whichever application is exhibiting this issue, and see if you get any results. If not, then it's possible there's an issue with this database. <comment230165> If you do get a result, post them here along with the result of `xattr -p com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LibreOffice.app`, or compare them yourself, again, replacing LibreOffice with the name of an application exhibiting this. The first value in the database record should match the last value in the extended attribute. <comment230428> I used VLC as an example.  `sqlite3 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2 .dump|grep -i VLC`  No result. <comment230430> I also reset the user permissions and ACLs before this. <comment230461> I think I found a "solution", but it is ***incredibly inelegant***. There must be a better way to accomplish this in OS X. If I login, as Administrator, then launch an app, it will give me the standard warning with `Cancel` and `Open` (`Show Webpage` is also an option). If I choose `Open` then all subsequent launches do not display any warning. Now if I login as the Standard user, no more warnings display when I try to open that specific application. <comment230465> In other words, for every application I downloaded and installed as Administrator, simply installing the Application is not enough. I must actually login as the Administrator and launch the application at least once to clear the warning for all other users. This seems incredible silly. I'm glad I found a "fix", but surely there must be a better way to accomplish this?
