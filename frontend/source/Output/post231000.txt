iOS: How to set language of app independent of iphone/ipad language <body> More &amp; more apps try setting their language automatically, based upon the language of your iPad, then the list of chosen languages.  Unfortunately, as do a lot of people, my preferred iOS/OSX system language is English, but certain apps (notably the new TomTom Go Mobile) need Dutch to be much of use (at least in Flanders, Belgium).  At the same time, the new WW (Weight Watchers mobile app) has poorly implemented localisation as well. Result: when my iPhone is in English, it loads the emFrench/em version (go figure) even if french is only the third preferred language (behind english &amp; dutch)  These apps should receive a warning in the app store, get banned altogether until their localisation performs as advertised, or its settings should get set from the settings menu, imho.  Is there a way to set the language independent from the main iOS language?  This problem pops up regularly (notably in bi-lingual countries or international, cosmopolitan people whose preferences and language capacities vary greatly).  If anyone at Apple is reading this; please help!  <answer231002> I'm not sure if this will work, but it might be worth a try...:  ol liRemove the App from your phone/li liChange iOS Language to "Dutch" in settings/li liReboot iPhone/li liOpen App Store, and download the App/li liOpen app and confirm it's Dutch/li liChange iOS language back to English/li /ol  <answer267649> If you change your region as well as your language and then download the app then all be well.  <comment282196> Doesn't work: app is the same, and limits the use of the app language and available voices (as it is a gps app) to the primary language of the iphone. <comment335870> This needs to be implemented by the app's developer (and usually isn't).
