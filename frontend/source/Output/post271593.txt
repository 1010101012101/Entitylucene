Spotlight opens Word files as Template? <body> Before I upgraded to Sierra, Spotlight worked perfectly. Now, it will find anything, but... Any Word file opened via spotlight becomes a Template, and needs a save as... to replace the previous version. The same file can be properly opened via Finder. Excel files are opened normally via Spotlight, but when trying to save, it has to be through Save as.
