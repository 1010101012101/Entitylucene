Double Mahjong Game Icons <body> This is a very specific question, but I hope that maybe a member of the Mac community may be able to offer a clue.  Years ago there was a free Mahjong game called Double, or Double X. It no longer runs on current hardware or software, but I am interested in the icons which it used. Here is a screen shot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a5pXU.gif" alt="enter image description here"  Does anybody know where the icons come from? The developers at PCV, who created the game, are no longer able to tell me.  Thanks  <answer245839> According to this resource, the game picture shown uses strongvarious/strong icons downloaded from http://xicons.macnn.com. However, this address does not exist anymore. The only reminder there about icons is on the forum and leads to an old http://www.xicons.com, which does not exist either and redirects to https://interfacelift.com now. However, there are no similarly looking icons there (amongst freely available), probably due to long time passed.  <comment303125> Did you try Google Image Search on them? <comment303150> Real longshot, but the 'apple with eyes' icon is the logo of http://www.tonymacx86.com [yup, the Hackintosh site] - maybe they might know?
