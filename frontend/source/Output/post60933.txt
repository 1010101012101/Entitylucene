How to re-download Lion from Mountain Lion <body> I'm currently running Mountain Lion, but I'd like to redownload Lion (to create a bootable install drive). However, when I click the download button in the App Store, I receive a message telling me my current OS X is newer and the download will not start.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dwEl4.png" alt="You can’t upgrade this version of Mac OS X ..."  Does anyone know a way to download Lion when already running Mountain Lion?  <answer60934> strongOfficial Answer:/strong  Unfortunately, it is not possible to download OS X Lion 10.7 from a computer currently running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 unless you want to do a stronglittle hacking/strong see below for more on that.   I would like to be proved wrong, but the results around the web such as Apple Support Communities - How do I download Lion if I'm running Mountain Lion? kind of confim you can no longer just download 10.7 from a Mac running 10.8.  ul liI Attempted to Download OS X Lion from a Mountain Lion Mac but no amount of kbdoption/kbd key tricks could get it to work./li liThe Lion re-download started immediately on a Mac running OS X Lion 10.7.4/li /ul  Confirming, you will need to download the "OS X Lion" Installer from a computer not running Mountain Lion. This limits downloading OS X Lion to a Mac running OS X Lion 10.7, or OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6 or later. Once you meet the requirements for OS X Lion the Mac App Store will allow you to download an already purchased version of OS X Lion.  strongSuper User Hack:/strong Yes its possible to download Lion from Mountain Lion if you perform the following hack, as usual proceed at your own risk.

It appears Lion was "hidden". kbdoption/kbd+click wouldn't reveal Lion in my previously purchased list.  To reveal it I had to go to "Store"  "View my account (my@account.com)..."  In the iTunes in the cloud section click on reveal hidden items.  On the new list click on Display for Lion  Then in the previousely purchased list Lion will appear without having to kbdoption/kbd+click  <comment70223> It never ceases to amaze me how much stuff is hiding behind that option key … <comment70229> Lion does not appear in the list for me after Option clicking. <comment70232> What kind of computer are you trying to download Lion onto? <comment70249> MacBook Pro early 2011 <comment70250> It doesn't seem to work. When clicking while holding option, I still get the same message. <comment70258> Ya that computer is 100% Lion compatible, just trying to rule out the case where the computer was release after Lion <comment70270> I can't see it in the purchases tab either. <comment70333> For what it's worth I see it when holding down option while clicking "Purchases".  I might have gotten it via the developer program and I also purchased Lion Server; don't know if either of those facts makes a difference. <comment70343> Actually, I don't have to hold option to see Lion in my purchased list; it's always there. The problem is I cannot download it. Clicking the link itself shows a message that Lion is no longer available in the store; clicking the download button shows a message that it won't download because I'm already running Mountain Lion. <comment70345> Well it's not what I hoped to see as an answer, but it most likely is the correct answer. <comment70389> @Ask Bjørn Hansen, we can see Lion in the MAS under purchased items on Mountain Lion, just can download it. Do you concur? <comment70391> I think this article is no longer true, looks like Apple implemented a time-frame to re-download, and that time window has passed. As the author hinted at in the article with "it’s not known if Apple will remove this feature in the future to help direct users toward OS X Mountain Lion". Well it looks like they have... <comment70559> [Will I still be able to buy and install Lion after Mountain Lion is released?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/51655/8546) <comment70778> I'm not sure how this is relevant; if I would've had a Lion recovery disk, I wouldn't have to be able to redownload Lion in order to create such a disk in the first place... <comment70779> Thanks a lot MrDaniel, this works, Lion is currently downloading :) <comment70780> Btw: to change the file using TextEdit you can copy it to your documents folder, edit it there, and copy the edited version to the original location (you'll be asked to enter your account password). <comment70796> I added a little to the answer. A person with Lion Recovery should be able to download the `InstallESD.dmg` for Lion. <comment131554> Sadly, this no longer works in Mavericks. I have no idea what would... time to dig through my collection of physical disks. <comment131821> @BradAckerman This tip is not necessary under 10.9 Mavericks, since the App Store on 10.9  just does the following: "Would you like to Continue?  "OS X 10.9 is already installed on this computer. Are you sure you want to download OS X 10.7" Press "Continue" to begin the Lion download. The good news is Apple is now less Jerks about these things™, so legacy away and feel free to download all the old versions of OS X. <comment135402> The message I get is that my computer doesn't support Mountain Lion, so it would appear that you can only download on a computer compatible with the OS you're downloading. <comment135596> @BradAckerman yes thats a correct assumption, you can only install onto machines that support that version of OS X. It may be the case when you see that "computer doesn't support" message when you are trying to install a version of OS X that was released before your Mac was built.
