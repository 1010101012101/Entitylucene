Is there a quick, free viewer for Word docs? <body> TextEdit will open them, but often doesn't display them correctly.  I really like QuickLook, but it won't stay open and doesn't allow for copying text.  OpenOffice seems to read the files adequately, but is slow to launch.  The ideal would be something like Preview that can open Word docs.  <answer322> Try strongBean/strong.    The last time I tried it, it was pretty quick (quicker than OpenOffice) and according to the website, can open code.docx/code files.  <answer324> Here's an interesting solution I've never seen before. Apparently a .docx is just an .xml file (which I've heard, but never actually investigated lol).  ul liChange the .docx extension to .zip/li liUnzip the file. You'll get an .xml/li liOpen and read the resulting .xml/li /ul  <comment295> +agreed. Bean is very quick + not bloated like openOffice. <comment297> "XML" doesn't really need "human-readable file". <comment298> What version of Mac OS X are you using? Both Leopard and Snow Leopard's version of TextEdit opens .docx files fine for me. <comment307> true, but it's still a pretty cool tip... maybe better suited as a comment though :) <comment341> It is quick! I was just looking for something like Preview, but this is great.
