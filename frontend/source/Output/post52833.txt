Install Clang 3.1 <body> What would be the best place to manually install llvm/clang binaries in OS X 10.7 without conflicting with existing/future versions shipped with xcode?  Thanks!  <answer52851> The usual place to install your own compiled libraries etc and make them available for all users is /usr/local (Except if you use Homebrew package manager which uses this directory)  Apple can overwrite any directory that is in /System or /Library or /Applications so don't use these, but you can use anything else.  see Apple development document on FileSystem basics for more detail.
