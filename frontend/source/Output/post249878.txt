Remove Add-in from Office 2016 for Mac <body> After installing an add-in (.xla) which worked once, I'm trying to remove it so I can install an updated version.  So far I've:  ul lideleted the .xla/li liremoved the check box in Tools  Add-ins/li liremoved it from the list/li liQuit Excel completely/li lireopened Excel./li /ul  I get an error that Excel can't find the plugin, it's back in the Add-ons list, and the Add-ins toolbar is still there with the Add-ins buttons.  Did all the same stuff again, this time with a reboot thrown in. No change.  Where is it storing this?  I looked through the plists in the Excel bundle, but couldn't find any references.  <answer283689> You have to do this through "My Add-Ins"  In the Insert Menu, select Add-Ins and then the submenu "My Add-Ins"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pfBrt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner of the Add-In you wish to remove.  Then click "Remove".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NuKxYm.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8FKwTm.png" alt="enter image description here"
