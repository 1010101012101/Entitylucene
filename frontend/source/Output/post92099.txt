Macbook randomly shuts down without on charge (even at ~90% full) <body> I'm having a real issue with my Macbook (white, late 2009 version, running Lion OS X). It was about since 2 weeks ago or so, my Macbook would just randomly shut down, I lost a couple unsaved files when that happened because I didn't expect it to shut down without asking/prompting. The weird thing is that my Macbook was just fully charged, just over 95% charged, but it still shuts down after a couple minutes of booting up.  Today, when I boot up, without using the power adapter, it will not go pass the login screen (even the first loading indicator when booting up). I am not sure why this is happening, now I have to leave my Macbook with the power adapter on at all times, even I cannot move my Macbook to another room without shutting the lid, and then unplug and plug it into another socket.  When I leave the power adapter on, and boot up. After logging in, I get a prompt message saying my Mac was restarted because of a problem; that is when I shut down and boot back up - no restarts, which is odd.  How can I get this issue fixed up? I would like to have my Macbook to work standalone without using the charge at all times.  <comment108091> Perhaps an ageing / faulty battery? I'd suggest looking up how to check how many cycles it has used... <comment108092> The cycle count is 770. <comment108095> I can't remember the exact numbers (it varies per model), but that sounds high to me.  If you have a local Apple Store, I'd book an appointment at the Genius Bar and take it to them for assessment.  Might be time for a new battery. <comment108107> Am sorry to report that whenever Powerbooks did this, it was logic board. Those random shutdowns.
