My icloud password does not work when prompted on start up. <body> This is a problem that is driving me nuts. I have tried everything I can find to get this to resolve. When I start my computer, I get a popup that wants my icloud password. I enter it and the password is not accepted. I then go to the browser icloud log in and I can log-in just fine. iTunes has issues as well. I plug-in my iPhone 6 (IOS 8) and the program does not see the phone. I went so far as to reinstall the ios in the phone.  Was better for a while but now just does not see the phone. Prior to the iphone everything worked without much trouble. But was not using iCloud sync service.  I also have a pop-upo on start-up requesting my Keychain password for call.app and sometime messenger.app.    <answer179250> You may need to run Keychain Repair to fix a few items in it that could be problematic.
