To keep Pages 09 working I deinstalled 10.12.4. But Font Book can't open under 10.12.3 <body> I must use Pages 09 (Pages 5 &amp; 6 lack 09 functions)  Instaling 10.12.4 froze pages. I reinstalled 10.12.3 but Font Book 'Can't Open'.     Is there a font manager that can open/manage fonts in Apple font Library   WHICH Manager PERFORMS FONT VERSION   ENABLING/DISABLING FUNCTIONS  SAME AS PREVIOUSLY  DONE BY NOW 'CAN'T OPEN'    FONT BOOK?
