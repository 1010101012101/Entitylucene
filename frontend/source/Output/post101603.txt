Iphone battery charging with other gear <body> A few minutes ago I needed to charge my iphone 4. I had the apple USB cable but not my wall adapter (sorry, I'm from Portugal and I don't master all the terms!).  I found that my eGo cigarette charger had just that missing part, just on a different collor. It seemed to me that the pecs where the same, so I tried it.  A few minutes latter I hear a click and the iphone stopped charging and a slight burn sent got in the air. The e-cigarette stoped working. Probably broke!  The question is. Do you think my iphone battery  got compromised with this? I ended up charging the rest directly from the PC USB port.  hr  PS: Specs on e-cigarette charger Input: 100 - 240V - 50/60 Hz 0.15A Output: 5V ---500mA  <answer101606> Not clear who and what smoked in your question.  I presume the ezig charger got fried since it was overloaded.  A word to the specs:  5 volt is 5 volt,however the problem could be the current.  The iPhone will take as much as it gets up to 1 Amp.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0U0X.png" alt="enter image description here"  If your ezig charger did not have a current limiter (like the USB on you Mac have) then it got overloaded.  Since you continued charging the iPhone using the Mac USB, you might be OK.
