iPhone 5s (iOS9) and iPad 2 (iOS9) Passcode Freeze <body> I have the advanced passcode enabled on my iPhone (i.e. a full passphrase as opposed to a simple numeric unlock code.) When I wake up my iPhone and enter the passcode, quite often it freezes.  I have to hit the sleep button and wake it up again and try again.  Often it takes 2 or 3 attempts.  The passcode entry will accept one or two keys then will not accept any more.  Occasionally, I will see the key tag pop up and it will freeze with that on the screen.  The strange thing is that this happens also on my iPad2.  And it happens when I am connected to wifi or LTE.  And it has been happening for a number of iOS versions. My iPhone was replaced due to the sleep button warrantee issue; and the problem occurred on both the old phone and the new phone.  I would have thought that so blatant a problem would be well-known on the internet, but I see no mention of it.  It's more annoying that anything else.
