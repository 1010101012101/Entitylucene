Can't delete files in the Trash in a SD card. Files are both there and not there <body> I wanted to delete some files on an SD card but then emptying the trash would take too long so I just canceled it and went with terminal to wipe it manually with coderm -rf/code    But then there are some directories that have some files that show up like they're there, but then when trying to delete or list them I get emNo such file or directory/em. Trying to delete the directory with coderm -rf/code gets emDirectory not empty/em.  Disk Utility won't fix it.br I'd like not to have to format the SD card if possible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kuul8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment354694> Have you tried rm after cd-ing to /Volumes/SD16GB/.Trashes (assuming you don't need anything in the trash)? <comment355054> @NoahL Yes, I did. Didn't work.
