What is writing to Disk causing eventual Beach-ball-of-death <body> What is running my machine down? This is iotop output...I still can't tell what is driving my system to a halt. Command+i on the SSD shows my "used space" slowly changing. It does this for about an hour...then freezes. I still have over 112 GB of free space on the drive...yet it yields me a... Beach-ball Of Death...any ideas?  If I listed what I've tried it would be two pages long.  iotop iosnoop kextstat kextunload on all Virtual Box drivers  removed Virtual Box  Beach-ball-of-death  Discovered Virtual Box is not the problem  Created another user...logged in as other user...same problem...  Beach-ball-of-death  Reinstalled OSX 10.8.2 from apple website....  Beach-ball-of-death  here is a gist of the output....  https://gist.github.com/4524724  <answer77747> Please post the make/model/specs of your machine, emand strongespecially the brand, model and firmware revision of your SSD/strong. I have an SSD that started throwing errors after 4,900 hours of operation. Updating the firmware resolved the issue./em   You can find the SSD firmware by running the Hardware Profile (or more info in About this Mac) and selecting strongSerial-ATA/strong and the your strongSSD/strong in the Device Tree.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cU3SI.jpg" alt="Hardware Profile SATA drives"  strongIs the problem hardware or software?/strong  I will attempt to list here a couple of possible issues, and what we need to help resolve.  If you have a second hard drive you can boot from (HDD, USB drive, etc.), please do.   ul liDoes the problem still occur? /li liIf it does, does it happen on the boot device or still on the non-booted SSD? /li liWhile booted from something other than the SSD, run any disk checking software you have, even if its just a Disk Utility/First Aid/Verify Disk/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FVles.jpg" alt="Disk Utility"  emWhen did this problem start, and can you peg it to any action you did?/em  strongWild process/strong  Open Activity Monitor. First, click the drop list and change from emMy Processes/em to strongAll Processes/strong. Then click on the %CPU column header once (or twice) so the list shows the top CPU users at the top   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QOQaX.jpg" alt="Activity Monitor"  emIs there a run-away process at the top? If so, please let us know./em  strongConsistency after reboot/strong  How soon after a reboot does the disk usage start? Do you reboot with the following option checked?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bFsMY.jpg" alt="OS X reboot dialog"  If you do, reboot, strongbut first uncheck the option/strong.   Now that you're opening with a "fresh" login,  ul lihow soon after reboot does the problem start? /li liIs there a consistency with any programs running when this happens?/li /ul  Your problem can be a lot of things, but from your initial output, I'm less inclined to think malware.  <comment90042> Can you reword your question to be more clear what you have tried and what you are asking? Especially the title. <comment90071> +10 for the EPIC response! I've done a few of these things already...I'll sit down and take time to respond in detail to this post later this week.
