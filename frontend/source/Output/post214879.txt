Visual Studio Code App wont run from Applications folder <body> The latest version of Visual Studio Code will not run ("can't be opened" is the unhelpful error) when I copy it to the applications folder.  It runs fine after unzipping to the Downloads folder, but just wont from the applications folder.  I don't think it's the security setting as that's already set to allow apps from anywhere.  OS X El Capitan on a Mid-2014 Macbook Pro  <answer216535> I had this issue and I found a workaround, which may work for you...  ol liUnzip Visual Studio Code in the download folder./li liRight-click Visual Studio code, in the download folder, and select 'emOpen/em'. If you're prompted by Gatekeeper, open the application./li liFrom the 'emCode/em' menu, select emPreferences/em  emUser Settings./em/li liOnce the settings files open, you can immediately close them both./li liFrom the 'emCode/em' menu, select emPreferences/em  emKeyboard Shortcuts/em./li liAs with #3, you can immediately close the files./li liQuit Visual Studio Code/li liCopy the Visual Studio Code application into your emApplications/em folder./li liOpen it from emApplications/em./li /ol  This worked for me - I have no idea why, perhaps a bug to do with accessing the preference file(s)? Maybe this might work for you?  <answer240459> Moving the codeVisual Studio Code.app/code into the code~/Applications/code folder instead of code/Applications/code worked for me.  <comment259517> I'd check the execute bit is set for everyone; I've had vague weirdness like that, where the actuall app inside the package didn't arrive with execute perms <comment259701> any link as to how?  its not my main machine, and not had to do this before. <comment259761> Use [BatChmod](http://www.lagentesoft.com/batchmod/index.html) Open the file, ensure 'X' is ticked for owner, group & everybody, check 'Apply to enclosed', Apply. <comment287390> FYI: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/92
