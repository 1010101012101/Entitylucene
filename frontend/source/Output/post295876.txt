MacBook Pro wonÂ´t let me log in after PRAM <body> I was having a problem with a pointer so after installing latest system updates with no effect on crazy pointer, I did a PRAM reset.   From then on, a log in page has changed:   ol limy user name has changed (in past i was using my whole name as login name. Some months ago, I changed it for a 'nickname'. But now, after PRAM reset, the old/previous user account name appears./li lithere was another account 'guest' not secured by password. Now the password is required./li li'my account' with changed user name doesn't accept my valid password. When typing a password incorrectly for 3 times, there is pop-up to log in with my apple ID. That does not work either. The password is correct. /li /ol  I am using this:   ul liMacBook Pro 2011 late/li lilatest operating system with updates/li liI never changed my apple ID since created/li lichanged my Apple ID last year/li lichanged my computer password also about a year ago/li /ul  <answer295878> It seems like the main issue to address here is being able to log in again with a valid password. Once you've done that the rest can be sorted.  Since you've got a late 2011 MacBook Pro, you emshould/em be able to use these steps to reset your password from Recovery Mode:  ol liPower off your MacBook Pro/li liBoot into Recovery Mode by pressing the power button while holding down kbdCommand/kbdkbdR/kbd/li liIf prompted, select your language and press kbdenter/kbd/li liChoose Utilities  Terminal./li liEnter coderesetpassword/code (all one word, lowercase letters)/li liPress kbdReturn/kbd/li liSelect the drive with your account (typically the main drive)/li liChoose your account using Select the User Account./li liEnter a new password /li liRe-enter the same password/li liEnter a password hint/li liClick Save /li liIgnore the warning about the password changing/li liClick OK./li liShutdown the Mac using Apple  Shut Down/li liRestart your MacBook Pro normally and use the new password to log into your account/li /ol  Let me know if this doesn't work.
