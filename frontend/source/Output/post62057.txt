How can I create a separate address book to sync to a different mobile phone? <body> I maintain my husband's contacts database up to now on a PC using Outlook. I switched to Mac for my own use (Mountain Lion) and use Apple Contacts for my own Address book.  I would like to create a separate address book for him on my Mac which I would then sync strongonly/strong to his mobile phone and iPad. I wish to keep his contacts completely separate from mine.  Is this possible and how do I do it?   <answer62067> Create a separate user account for your husband. Your stuff will be different. Steps:  ol liSystem Preferences  Users and Groups./li liClick the lock icon in the bottom left and fill in your password./li liClick the + below the left pane./li liFill in the credentials./li liLog in to that account and start filling out the contacts./li liIf you want to copy over any contact, select the contacts in the address book and then File  Export. Save the files on a USB drive or a place not in your home directory./li liJust open the files in your husbandâ€™s account. They will be added to Contacts./li /ol  If you are talking about an iPhone, another thing you could do is use iCloud. That would be much better and much more streamlined.  <comment71685> The solution proposed here is the best for simplicity but you could also look into [rooSwitch](http://rooswitch.com) which allows you to move preferences (and data files) in and out under an application in general. In specific, this is hard since AddressBook syncs and uses a database so moving things around in this case can be problematic if another process is reading contacts when you swap things.
