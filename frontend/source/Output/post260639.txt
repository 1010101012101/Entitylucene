Chrome links won't open from from gmail app <body> iPhone 7br iOS 10.1.1br Gmail 5.0.3br Chrome 54.0.2840.91    When trying to open a link directly within the gmail app, it opens in safari instead of chrome.    I looked in the gmail settings under google apps, to use the app instead of the browser.  There is no option for Chrome where I imagine their should be.     I can't any other option to make chrome the default browser instead of safari.    Help?
