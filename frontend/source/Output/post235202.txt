JBL2 bluetooth speaker increasing MacBook Air's volume <body> I have a JBL2 connected to my MacBook Air. Whenever I connect the JBL via Bluetooth it increases the (previously low) volume of the Mac to a deafening maximum resulting in a nice blast that even my neighbors can hear.  How can I stop the JBL from automatically increasing the volume?  <comment287663> The JBL speaker cuts out the Mac speakers so how does the Mac's volume increase?
