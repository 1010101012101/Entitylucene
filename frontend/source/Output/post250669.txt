How to disable auto charge when my iPad plugged into my Mac? <body> Whenever I plugged my iPad into my Mac, it will auto charge. For some reasons, I wanna turn this feature off. Is there anyway to do it? I searched but only got not revalent answers.  <answer250671> No, you can't. The only way this could be possible would be through disabling output charge from your Mac, but that's not possible either as far as I know.  Another possible way would be to use a special kind of USB cable which allows data exchange without charging the device.   <answer250677> I looked around for a "data only cable" or one where you could "disable charging," and found nothing online that seemed relevant. It may be possible to have a "data sync only" with a Nokia device, but not an Apple device.  I found articles describing altering the 8-pin, but those resulted in shorting and other problems, so this is not advisable.   I also identified no apps that disable charging in the iOS App Store.  On thing you could do is turn on iTunes wi-fi syncing. Plug your iPad into your computer. Open iTunes. Click the checkbox that enables wi-fi syncing under "Options."  My iPad Pro says that it has to be plugged in to sync automatically, but I was able to do it manually without it being plugged in. Just go to General  iTunes Wi-Fi Sync  Sync Now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q8PK4.jpg" alt="WiFi Sync"
