Why does Time Machine only backup after a reboot? <body> I have a Mini running Lion Server that has a USB hard drive attached to it for backups. I also have a MBP running Lion that I've set to use that same drive as a remote backup destination over the network.  The remote backups have never failed; however, the local backups from Server to its USB disk only work right after a reboot. When the machine tries to run its next scheduled backup it fails with     strongTime Machine Error/strong      Unabled to complete backup. An error occurred while creating the backup folder.        Latest successful backup: 12/2/11 at 11:50 PM   at which point I usually reboot the machine and manually run a backup, which succeeds.  h2Things I've tried/h2  ol liI've tried googling that error message, but "An error occurred" isn't much to go on./li liI've tried repairing the drive in Disk Utility, but it didn't find any errors./li /ol  h2Other Notes/h2  When I first plugged in this USB disk I told Time Machine to erase it and set it up. It has a GUID Partition Table, one 1TB partition formatted to emCase-sensitive, Journaled Mac OS Extended/em.  What can I do to have my backups run without needing intervention?  <answer32887> Things to check:  ul liSoftware Update (read the description to see if it fixes the issue for your OS X 10.7 server)/li liCheck if OS X 10.7 Server requires its Time Machine to be formatted using emCase-sensitive, Journaled Mac OS X Extended/em. Anecdotally, I've always formatted my Time Machine backup as  emMac OS X (Journaled)/em and Time Machines works fine./li liCheck the Permissions. Check that your OS X 10.7 Server user id has access to the USB partition./li /ul  <answer33342> Turns out the problem was a bad disk. At first it wasn't obvious, but after a few days it started making the infamous clicking sound. After I replaced the disk, the backups started working both locally and remotely.  <comment37606> A first step would be to run `tmdiagnose` which collects a ton of diagnostic details to try and isolate issues with the time machine software.  It may require help fom Apple or a technician if you aren't familiar with what a normal diagnosis run is or the underlying mechanisms.
