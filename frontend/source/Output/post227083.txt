How can I create a reminder on my Apple Watch? <body> I would like to create an iCloud reminder using my Apple Watch while running. Siri is not working and speech recognition is not working either since I'm offline.   Is there an app that allows me to type a reminder?  <answer227090> There's Proud app on the iTunes where you can create tasks without dictation. It costs 4.99$.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wj13k.jpg" alt="Proud Apple Watch app"   <comment275878> I don't think that there would be anything that allows you to create a reminder without using voice dictation.
