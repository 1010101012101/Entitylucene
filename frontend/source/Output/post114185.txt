How do I stop file types from launching automatically <body> Is there a way to remove the 'open with' default that is on certain file types? I don't want to replace the the application that opens this file type, I want there to be no application assigned to that type, so that when I download it, no application automatically launches.  Basically is there a way to remove the default application a file type is opened with, and not replace it another application?  <answer114208> That information is stored in the Launch Services database. The codelsregister/code command can be used to manipulate that database. As far as I've been able to gather, you can only unregister an entire application, not an association for a specific file type. You can do that with this command:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -u /Applications/&lt;appname&gt;.app /code/pre  But note that there is an automatic process in OS X that searches the /Applications folder and registers the applications it finds there. So if you have an application that wants to open a certain file type, the association might get recreated even if you have unregistered the application.  Someone may have a better answer than this but hopefully this will be at least a little helpful.  <answer114209> I see what you are asking, but I think your solution is actually somewhere different.  I think you might be referring to setting in Safari preferences.
