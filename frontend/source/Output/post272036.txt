How to refuse DHCP Server to change my hostname? <body> I was not able to refuse changing my hostname by DHCP Server on Mac Book. None of these solutions below worked for me:  ul liHow can I stop Mac OS X overriding my hostname when I receive a DHCP request on Snow Leopard?/li liMac refusing to change hostname/li liComputer name keeps changing (deleting files)/li /ul  After deleting the files as suggested from the Apple engineer it retrieved a new hostname and a new ip. But it wasn't a static hostname. Creating the file /etc/hostconfig doesn't work neither.   I mean come on, that's a well known feature and it should work. Poorly it doesn't for now. I'm sure there must be a solution for this.  As the server we are using a Mac Mini with built-in DNS and DHCP. My Mac Book's system is macOS Sierra 10.12.3  Edit: From the 3rd link, the Apple engineer suggested to delete the following three files in code/Libray/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code:  precodecom.apple.airport.preferences.plist NetworkInterfaces.plist preferences.plist /code/pre  <answer274891> It took a LOT of Googling and digging to get this, but I finally found a solution that works. DHCP overrides the codeLocalHostName/code system property, but not the codeHostName/code property. By default the codeHostName/code is not set in macOS Sierra, so you can set it as well as codeLocalHostName/code and codeComputerName/code using codescutil/code:  precodesudo scutil --set HostName yourcomputername sudo scutil --set LocalHostName yourcomputername sudo scutil --set ComputerName "Your Computer name" /code/pre  The codeHostName/code property appears to be permanent. codeLocalHostName/code can still be overridden, but it won't override codeHostName/code once it's set.  <answer274906> Open code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist/code with Xcode and add to the ‘ProgramArguments’ array with the string code--no-namechange/code. Save the file and restart the machine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wwEEy.png" width="600"  <comment345773> com.apple.discoveryd.plist as well as /usr/libexec/discoveryd only exist in some Yosemite releases (10.10.0-10.10.3).... <comment346431> Well, I think both solutions would do it. As I prefer the bash, I used your solution. The hostname isnot changed anymore after a few reboots.
