How do I install Intel's ifortran and MKLs on Mac OS X? <body> I need to install Intel's ifortran and Math Kernel Libraries (MKL) on OS X 10.7 Lion, available (for non-commercial use) here. Has anyone experience in doing so? Or should I rather setup a virtual Linux instead?  <answer45755> The non commercial tools all appear to be for Linux ony so you will need to use the VM.  Although TBB is available for OS X.  <comment54390> @Mark the answer below (use Linux) is more or less the last resort to take if you really want to have ifort on OS X, and since I´m still trying to get it running on my Mac, I´m waiting until I know it´s the only option (and correct answer). <comment54391> Linux and OSX have totally different object structures so you can't run code from one on the other without some emulation layer.
