How to make show all music option reappear in the Music app? <body> I turned the show all music option off on my iPod, but now the button has disappeared and hasn't reappeared since. How do I make the button reappear? I've already tried restarting my iPod, and the worst part is that I can only see my music on my Windows 7 PC.  <answer187913> To show all music, you will want to go to:  Settings - iTunes &amp; App Store  In there, under "Show All" set Music to On  <comment222258> Could you post a screenshot of what you're seeing in the app right now? How did you turn the option off? <comment222262> so i went to options and then i scrolled down to music, then i clicked on it and turned show all music off so i could get rid of the u2 album <comment222263> its still not there :/
