Cannot delete old Exchange account from Internet Accounts in El Capitan <body> I have an old Exchange account, I don't have access to it nor remember the password.  I want to delete it.  When I go to Internet Accounts, select it, and click "-" to delete it, it asks "are you sure", I say "yes", and nothing happens. The account is still there.  <answer246083> If it was installed using a Profile sometimes you cant remove it using Internet Accounts. Instead you need to go to System Preferences - Profiles and remove the email profile.
