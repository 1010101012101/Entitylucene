Copying Files Using SuperDuper! <body> First time using SuperDuper and after an hour of attempting to copy files, the process is still in '1. Prepare to Copy Files'. Is this normal?  <answer179563> SuperDuper! has an option to repair permissions on the source volume before copying. Normally this shouldn’t take 1 hour, unless maybe you’ve never run a permissions repair in the last years and the permissions are totally screwed.  I would try this:  ol liDo the permissions repair with Apple’s Disk Utility app./li liStart SD, click on the emOptions…/em button, then, under the emGeneral/em tab, deselect the option emBefore copy … Repair permissions on &lt;source volume&gt;/em./li liStart copying./li /ol  <comment212845> depends on how large/full the drive is. I use CCC rather than Super Duper, but the process can take several hours. I'd leave it overnight before panicking & aborting it.
