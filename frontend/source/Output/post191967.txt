Accessing dictionary keys using defaults <body> How do I use defaults to access a specific field in a dictionary? I've tried doing this  precode$ defaults read -app Terminal "Window Settings.Pro" /code/pre  but it doesn't work. Accessing code"Window Settings"/code on its own does work though, and codePro/code is a key in that dictionary.  <answer191968> codedefaults/code isn't capable of doing this.   One of the options you have is codeplistbuddy/code :  precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "print 'Window Settings':Pro" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist /code/pre  <comment228226> Is there a way to "refresh" the terminal after making a change? Because it doesn't seem to be committed. Reading the value shows it has changed, but the terminal doesn't reflect that change, and opening its settings also shows the old value.
