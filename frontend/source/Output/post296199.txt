is there a notification on find my macbook? <body> when you use find my iphone to locate a macbook does it notify the macbook that you are online?  If I sign into Find My Iphone on my phone and my macbook is in use by someone else, will they see that I have signed in?   <answer296228> Tested empirically...br No, not until I "Played a sound", which played &amp; put up a dialog on the Mac, then I was sent an email, within 2 seconds, which of course arrived on both my iPhone &amp; Mac simultaneously, telling me I'd 'Played a sound'.  So, you can check the location without any notification, provided that's all you do.  <comment374379> thank you for testing and answering!!!
