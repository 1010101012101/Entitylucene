Why does VTEncoderXPCService take up all my cpu? <body> 2010 Macbook Pro. Pretty frequently, my mac will spend over 100% cpu on VTEncoderXPCService. It causes the fan to spin up and it causes the computer to get hot.   precodeps -ef | grep -i vtencoder /code/pre  shows   precode01   879     1   0 Mon10PM ??       261:54.85 /System/Library/Frameworks/VideoToolbox.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/VTEncoderXPCService.xpc/Contents/MacOS/VTEncoderXPCService /code/pre  which doesn't shed much light on the situation for me.  I'm not doing anything with video when this happens, either.  Any thoughts on what this is doing and/or how I can get it to not heat up my laptop so much?  <answer233026> I run into this with the Photos app open, usually when it's syncing media with iCloud. It's especially bad when the sync fails somehow. If you're able to get it to reproduce consistently, maybe send over some information to http://bugreport.apple.com.  <answer259189> Here, I got this going when Photos app is exporting pics to a slow drive, my USB memory stick. No issue as it disappeared as soon as the export was done.  <answer273768> It seems to be related to pulling movies out of Photos.  I had a large movie I was trying to take out of photos to a folder and move to an external drive.  This process was using over 300% of CPU for several minutes.
