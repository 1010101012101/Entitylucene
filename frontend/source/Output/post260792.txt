Restore old file paths and directories for misplaced files <body> I have a Macbook Pro late 2011 running OSX code10.11.1/code El Capitan. Have an issue that's simple to create but seems very hard to fix.   My daughter was using my computer and "accidentally" moved a whole bunch of files (15 000 / 22 GB) from the codeall my files/code tab in the finder window to another folder she created on the computer. As a consequence a whole bunch of projects have missing files as now all the file paths have changed. Given that there's so many files there's no way I can find out where they all came from and put them back manually.   I was wondering if anyone can think of a solution to put all these files back  to their original locations (happened a few days ago so codecmd z/code is not an option). Do the files have previous filepaths stored in the metadata? If so could I extract that and just a write maybe a quick script to put them back to their original locations? Unfortunately I don't have Time Machine running on this computer so can't restore a previous snapshot.    Thanks in advance!
