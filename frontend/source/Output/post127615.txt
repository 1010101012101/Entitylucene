Is there a way to generate random passwords in Safari, without iCloud? <body> I know that iCloud Keychain has a feature where it offers to generate strong, random passwords directly in Safari. Some third-party password managers allow it, but I'd prefer to store the password in the OS X keychain, so I'm really just looking for a password generator, not full-blown manager. For other browsers there is addons that offer similar functionality. It's possible to do it in the regular non-iCloud Keychain Access app, but this is a bit cumbersome.  Is there any way of generating a random password directly in Safari, but without using iCloud keychain?  <answer127630> No there is no way in Safari directly,  You can only go directly to the Keychain  br/ (Spotlight - Keychain // or via the Finder - /Applications/Utilities/Keychain.app)  br/  and create a new Key (CMD+N).  You will get the window with the little key icon and when you click on it, it will show you a little popup with the Password Assistant.  <comment149654> Yes, this I'm aware of, but as I said it is a bit cumbersome. Is there no plugin / add-on / extension that does this in Safari itself? Or maybe is there any way of tricking Safari into thinking it is using iCloud keychain? <comment172510> Have you tried 1Password? <comment223246> maybe we can trick you into using iCloud keychain
