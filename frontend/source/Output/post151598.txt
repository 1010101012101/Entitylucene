How do I change the feedback/volume sound effect back to the one in Mavericks? <body> So I recently installed OSX Yosemite, and one of the immediate changes I noticed was the lack of sound when changing volume. In System Preferences I found you can turn it back on, but instead of the "pop" it plays a woodblock sounding noise. I know where to find where the sound effect is stored, but how do I change it back?  Also, it appears that the old sound effect is nowhere to be found, so if anyone knows where I can find or download it again that would be lovely.  <comment178439> sorry you missed it! I offered you a link from my Dropbox but it was time limited. Let me know when you are on line to try again.
