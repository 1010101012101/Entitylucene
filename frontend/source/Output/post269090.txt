iMessage often fails to send SMS on non-ios device <body> Not sure i'm on the right StackExchange.  Since iOS10.1, my iPhone often fails to send SMS. After sending, it waits, then display the red (!), saying "emnot delivered/em"  ul liit seems to only happen on non-iphone recipients/li limost of time (everytime??), my recipient still get my message (in spite of the emnot delivered/em warning)/li lisomeone told me "emwhy do you always send your messages twice?/em"./li /ul  Does it happen to anyone?  If so, did you find a solution?  <answer269091> Update to iOS 10.2 if you haven't done that. Then disable and enable iMessage, see if the problem persists.  <answer269092> This could be down to people previously using an iPhone and having their number registered with iMessage, and then moving to a non-iOS device. In this case, your phone is still trying to send the message over the iMessage platform even though the recipient can't receive it. They can check and de-register here.  <answer269093> I think you have this problem, because you are using the same strongemail/strong on two or more devices. Anyway I will provide you with two methods, because i had a similar problem like yours back in the day.  ul liemMethod 1:/em (not an universal fix)/li /ul  Go to strongSettings/strong  strongNotifications/strong  strongMessages/strong, turn off notification center  Then Go to strongSettings/strong  strongMessages/strong, turn off iMessage  Reboot the phone  Turn strongiMessage/strong notifications back on, then turn strongiMessage/strong back on, in that order.  ul liemMethod 2:/em (if you are using the same iCloud account on two or more devices)/li /ul  Go to: strongiMessages/strong  strongSettings/strong  strongSend &amp; Receive/strong  turn on all your phone numbers and email.  emMost importantly/em, set "strongStart new conversations from/strong" your phone number, not from your email addresses.  Good luck.  strongEDIT/strong: If you update to the latest iOS version this problem will be fixed by  itself.  <comment338032> Please read the tags **before** posting your question. <comment338033> You are asking an off-topic question.

I tried to disable and enable iMessage again, it does nothing. Il only happen on the "green bubbles", the ones which do not use iMessage service. <comment338036> hmmmmm... very interesting. But I know that many of the problematics contacts did never have any iphone. The kind of linux guys, you know :) <comment338037> Thanks for your feedback. I updated my device before you sent this post. Now I only sent 2 sms with no problem, but it's not enough to tell. If the update to 10.2 works, I won't be able to test your two methods, though. <comment338038> I am glad that I can help you. I forgot to mention that this "twice sending" can occur when you are in a low coverage area. I've managed to find another thing.  Go to: **Settings**  **Messages**  turn off **Send as SMS** function. and another thing: Ensure that only **your phone number** is listed in the *“You can be reached by iMessage at”* area. If you have an email address or anything else listed, it could cause duplicate text messages.  Thats in the **Send and Receive** section.  Good luck, Martin! <comment338077> Turning off send as SMS means that if the iMessage fails to be delivered no message at all is sent. At least with that option on it will send it as an SMS after a few minutes.
