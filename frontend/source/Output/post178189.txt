I just have the free version and 2,2GB takes a lot of my space.  <answer193533> I found a solution to my problem. So for future readers:  Mail is caching (Bug?) the storage space in Mail. So after deleting a few thousands E-Mails, the space is still taken.  strongThe solution:/strong     Insert a few E-Mails back in archive. After importing a few E-Mails   again, Apple is updating the cache.   strongGuide:/strong     ol   liDeleting every E-Mail in archive/li   liSpotting that the space is still taken/li   liInsert 3-4 E-Mails back to archive/li   liWaiting until the space is updated (look at iCloud.com)/li   liDeleting the 3-4 E-Mails in archive/li   /ol   <comment211101> Did you also empty the Trash?
