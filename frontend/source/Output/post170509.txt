iPhone 5s with question on calendar <body> I started a new calendar. Can anyone get in and see my appointments? This is my private calendar to make my appointments. I am starting new job I want to make sure that old boss can't see anything.  <answer170513> If the old boss doesn't have your AppleID &amp; password &amp; you don't explicitly share the calendar, no-one can see it.   You could always change your password if you are in the slightest doubt over that &amp; also sign in to https://www.icloud.com/#settings select Advanced/Data &amp; Security, then Sign out of all browsers.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TbRM0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment200444> your best choice is to use the online Google Calendar that your Boos can not get to.
