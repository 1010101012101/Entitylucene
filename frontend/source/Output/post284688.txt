Enabling Stealth Mode in macOS Sierra doesn't work (still responds to ping) <body> I've checked the "Enable stealth mode" option on my Mac (running macOS Sierra 10.12.5), which is supposed to make my computer not respond to "test applications using ICMP, such as Ping" however, this doesn't work. I can still ping my system with codeping localhost/code and get responses, as well as from another devices on my local network (e.g. codeping 10.0.1.5/code). If I check pfctl's firewall rules I get this:  precodeMacbook:~ main$ sudo pfctl -a com.apple/250.ApplicationFirewall -s rules No ALTQ support in kernel ALTQ related functions disabled scrub in all fragment reassemble block drop in inet proto icmp all icmp-type echoreq block drop in inet proto icmp all icmp-type echoreq block drop in inet6 proto ipv6-icmp all icmp6-type echoreq /code/pre  Which, according to this guide are the correct rules to block ICMP ping requests. I've also tried running the same ICMP ping test with the "Block all incoming connections" option checked too, but it made no difference, and neither did blocking incoming ICMP connections with Little Snitch. I ran the same tests on another Mac with the exact same settings and it blocked ping requests correctly. I've also tried to check the firewall log to see if it had any information using codeopen /var/log/appfirewall.log/code but it's blank, although this seems to be a known issue.   In the end though, why isn't stealth mode working properly?
