Non existent email on iCloud <body> My iCloud email is a non existent email address. I have tried to change it but it only shows up in grey lettering. strongManage My Accounts/strong does not have this email account available for me to access.  <comment359570> Are you saying an @icloud.com address doesn't exist, or an unrelated email address being used as an Apple ID doesn't exist?
