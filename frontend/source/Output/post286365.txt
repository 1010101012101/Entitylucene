Execute terminal command "rsync" from BetterTouchTool <body> I have created a Bash command that will copy the contents of one folder into another, and it works as expected from inside Terminal.   precodersync -r /Users/owendostie/Dropbox/Ohouse /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/Ohouse /code/pre  However, when I attempt to create a hotkey to execute this command using BetterTouchTool, nothing happens. I found another user who has encountered a similar problem, but I do not know enough about Terminal for his answer to be helpful. What do I need to change about my command to get it to run from inside BetterTouchTool?  <answer286366> According to the format of the answer to that question, you'd want to specify the full path to the rsync program. I looked around a bit and found my rsync executable inside the folder /usr/bin/. If your rsync is in the same place (it should be), you should modify your command in BetterTouchTool to:  precode/usr/bin/rsync -r /Users/owendostie/Dropbox/Ohouse /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/Ohouse /code/pre  Unfortunately I don't use BTT so I can't test this, but that is how the other answer solved the issue.  <comment361295> Your suggestion makes perfect sense, but it doesn't seem to work. Maybe it has something to do with user permissions?
