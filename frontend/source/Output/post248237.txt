OS X Color Picker: Removing a Colour Swatch <body> I am running OS X El Capitan, and any solutions I have found are out of date.  I can add a colour to my swatch drawer by dragging it. However, how do I remove a colour?  All the articles I have read suggest dragging an adjacent white cell onto the colour, but the empty cells are no longer white and and attempting to drag an empty cell does nothing.  Thanks  <answer269774> Using the eye dropper actually does work. What is interesting is that once you drag it to a swatch that swatch becomes "blank" you can continue to drag that to other swatches and "blank" those out, but if you go back to a swatch you blanked out, that one is no longer draggable. The only draggable "blank" swatch is the last one you "blanked" out.  <comment307533> How about using the eye-drop tool to select the background color of an "empty" swatch (`#ECECEC`), and then dragging and replacing the colors you'd like to delete? They will appear "empty" and you can always overwrite them. I agree that there definitely is not an intuitive way to do this.
