Can applepay technology be used to pay for metro rail and fares? <body> In Los Angeles county, we have a tap card system where you hold it against the surface on a reader and it deducts the card value from the card. Can iphone smartphones with applepay be used as a proxy to these tap cards? Are the technologies compatible?  Edit:  According to Wikipedia, the tap cards are based on rfid: en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_smart_card#Technology  Apple pay is also based on rfid  <answer170797> Only if the Los Angeles county department that deals with payments have made their systems compatible with Apple Pay. You will need to ask this question of them.  <answer170823> Sadly, No. Not at this time.   Thank you,   Regional TAP Service Center 866-TAPTOGO (866-827-8646)  http://www.taptogo.net/  -----Original Message-----  Subject: Is taptogo compatible with applepay?  <comment200865> Sounds like you're not familiar with the technology that tap uses...
