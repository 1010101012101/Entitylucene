Installation of Wine via MacPorts not working with 10.8 and XCode 4.4 <body> I had installed wine on my computer with then 10.7.4. It worked perfectly. Then I updated to 10.8 and wine did not work, so I uninstalled wine and macports. It gave me an error that winetricks (I installed it) could not be removed. Then I reinstalled it (and also installed X11) with the new Mountain Lion macports and, while installing wine with the terminal command: codesudo port install wine/code i got this error:  precodeError: org.macports.build for port libunwind-headers returned: command execution failed Error: Failed to install libunwind-headers Please see the log file for port libunwind-headers for details: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_devel_libunwind-headers/libunwind-headers/main.log /code/pre  And it seems the log file doesn't even exist. What happened? I have xode 4.4  <comment68453> I don't know why it does not work with Macports but instead of Macports you could try Homebrew http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ <comment68456> Have you reinstalled the Xcode commandline tools? I think I had to do this when I updated to ML, even if Xcode hadn't been updated. <comment68467> Yes, I installed the command line tools. I reinstalled (and updated) xcode <comment68519> thanks GM. It worked. As you said, it was only an error with macports.
