Messages on MacBook Pro - An internal Messages error occurred <body> Not sure if this is the problem, but I recently updated to Sierra.   Since then I get this error when I open Messages:  An internal Messages error occurred. There was a problem with Messages. You need to quit and open Messages again.  I have quit, and reopened so many times. I have even followed these instructions I found: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7493929?start=0&amp;tstart=0  And STILL receive the error!! Please help, it is driving me crazy!
