How to automatically add `brew update ruby` to `rbenv` versions? <body> I just did a codebrew update/code which updated a ruby version (codebrew ruby --version/code), but when I coderbenv versions/code it isn't listed there because I didn't do coderuby install &lt;ruby version&gt;/code.  Is there a way to automatically add the codebrew ruby/code version to coderbenv/code so that it doesn't have to re-download and compile?
