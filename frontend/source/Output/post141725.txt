Using SVG animation in Keynote <body> I've made some SVG animations which I'd like to use in a Keynote 6 presentation. Unfortunately, Keynote does not have native support for SVGs (pasting one in will just rasterize it and ignore the animation.)   So I assume my best bet is to somehow convert the SVG animation to a video format and use that. Looking around the web there seems to be a paucity of tools to accomplish this; one suggestion is to just screencap the SVG animation, but that leads to poor quality.   Is there a good way to generate a video directly from an SVG animation?
