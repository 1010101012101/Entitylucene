Using applescript with Calendar in El Capitan <body> I've been trying for weeks to script an ipad restore process for Apple Configurator 2.  My script works fine when ran within Script Editor, and it also works as a stand alone application.  The problem occurs when my script is launched from a Calendar event (which is the whole idea so I don't have to run it manually).  Here is the first part of my script:  precodetell application "Apple Configurator 2" activate delay 30 tell application "System Events"     tell process "Apple Configurator 2"         keystroke "a" using {command down}         delay 5         click menu item "1 - Erase" of menu 1 of menu item "Apply" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Actions" of menu bar 1         delay 5         click button "Apply" of sheet 1 of window "All Devices"     end tell end tell /code/pre  The script triggers just fine, and all is working until it attempts to click the "Apply" button.  My script application returns this error: Can't get window "All Devices" of &lt; "Apple Configurator 2" of application  "System Events".  System Events got an error: Can't get window "All  Devices" of process "Apple Configurator 2". (-1728)  As an Applescript newbie, I'm out of ideas. Anybody else? Thanks!  <answer253499> Code does not work as is. I have tested this and it works.  precodetell application "Apple Configurator 2" activate delay 30 tell application "System Events"     keystroke "a" using {command down}     delay 5     click menu item "1 - Erase" of menu 1 of menu item "Apply" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Actions" of menu bar 1     delay 5     click button "Apply" of sheet 1 of window "All Devices" end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment315648> Many thanks!  I'll try this right away. <comment315649> Please keep me updated. <comment315881> Hmm, not able to get as far as before.  Now I get "Can't get class mbar 1 of application "System Events". System Events got an error: Can't get menu bar 1. (-1728) <comment315886> Which would make sense because menu bar 1 would belong to Configurator not System Events, right?
