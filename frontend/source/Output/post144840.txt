Any idea why this iPhone didn't sell? <body> Does anyone see a problem with this iPhone 5c that caused it not to sell?    http://www.ebay.com/itm/GOOD-CONDITION-WARRANTY-FREE-BUNDLE-iPhone-5c-Latest-Model-16GB-White-AT-T-/121432526381?pt=Cell_Phones&amp;hash=item1c45f14e2d  It isn't my phone but I'm about to list one.  <answer144842> The first think I look at is the seller reputation, and the seller in the hyperlink you provided has a 98.7% positive feedback; not so great, not too horrible either.  Also, in my opinion, seller should have started the listing at $.01 or $1.00.  The starting price for that auction is probably good for Buy It Now, but still a little steep.  <comment170639> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about hardware shopping
