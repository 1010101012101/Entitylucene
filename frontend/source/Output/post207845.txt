Recover MiniKeePass master password? <body> I've been using MiniKeePass for a while now to store and access some of my passwords from an iPhone. Since I already use a passcode to unlock the phone, I somehow configured MiniKeePass to don't ask for an extra password before letting me open the database and show me my passwords.  Now I want to transfer the passwords database to a new phone, which I did successfully by exporting to/importing from Dropbox. The problem is that the to open the database on the new phone it now asks for the master password and/or key file. I've checked (via iTunes) and there seems to be no key file on MiniKeePass shared files the old phone, and I've forgotten by now whatever master password I used to create the database in the first place.  Is there a way to somehow recover the master password from the old phone? Some-emthing/em should be available there, as I'm still able to successfully open the database and view my passwords without problems.
