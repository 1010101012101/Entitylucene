The same error becomes when click another time for download. <comment252378> Can you give us more specs on your Mac? Age, memory left, etc. <comment252418> https://support.apple.com/kb/SP728?locale=en_US <comment252554> @CalebKleveter As per **support** link i match whole configuration, it is fulfill with my Mac mini.  Age:- 17 months old  For memory left almost it is 3GB after starting required application. Though it is another way for finding memory left then please tell me.  If you want another information about system then fell free to ask me. <comment252626> The spec page shows two things 1) 2GB of memory, 2) 8.8GB of available storage. That means you need at least 2GB of RAM, and 8.8GB of storage left on your internal hard drive. You probably knew that, but I thought I would point it out just in case. <comment252628> @CalebKleveter Yes i know about the memory. Also i try with 2GB+2GB = 4GB memory but not working it. Also my system have more than 400GB available storage. Thank you for reply.. <comment252636> Looks like you are saying you signed in with a developers ID, can you sign in with a normal Apple ID?
