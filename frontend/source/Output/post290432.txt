Iphone email client - same email address with new server - how to preserve emails <body> I'm in situation where I should:  ul lireplace server address/li lireplace username &amp; password/li liabsolutely, ultimately preserve previous emails /li /ul  on strongPOP/strong accounts on strongiPhone email client/strong.  Is there a way to have this. Again to note, I'm requested not to create additional account (and disable old one) but to apply new changes to existing POP account and keep old mails.  Any help or clue is appreciated.  <comment366582> Is there still a question here after your edit? <comment366584> Yes. I got all correctly for AppleMail but iPhone old mails (luckily test ones) are corrupted after what'ive done <comment366585> Can you please update your question then? Are you looking for ways to fix your iPhone mails (in this case describe the steps you took and what actually got corrupted) or did you rollback the changes and are looking for a better way to do it? <comment366593> @patrix, yes you're right. I'll do that.
