Strange sound playing at random intervals <body> I was able to record this random sound.   It started playing few weeks before. I have tried many things to find out which application is playing it, but nothing has worked.   I have already tried answers from this question.  Also I have tried disabling all sound notifications in system settings.  Any idea, where this sound is coming from?  <comment356264> Do you have Apple Mail running? Could be the Sound of a Rule being applied to a Mail, f.e. Spam-Mail or regular Rules <comment356407> @J.C. Not really. I dont use Apple Mail at all. But I do have following programs running almost all the time.  - Google Chrome - Firefox - iTerm2 <comment356456> It could perhaps be a Google+ Notification (in Chrome) or Facebook Messaging Notification (in Chrome or FF) grom the browsers - if you use these services. You should definitly start the console.app and let it run in the Background. Next time you hear the sound, look in the Console and look for notification events or something similar. Post the results here. <comment356457> You should also watch the Tabs in your Browsers - the show a litte Speaker symbol if there is sound running on a Webpage, f.e. from some annoying Ad-Banner (with sound).
