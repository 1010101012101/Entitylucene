Download iPhoto library organized in albums <body> Over time I've created several albums on my iPhone and these photos have been backed up online to iCloud.br Now I'd like to download to my PC the entire iPhoto library (stored online) but with the album folders still intact. Is this possible?  <comment356908> How did you back them up, did you enable iCloud syncing for photos? <comment356909> @patrix yes, some of them were directly uploaded from my iPhone while some others from the upload folder of iCloud in windows explorer
