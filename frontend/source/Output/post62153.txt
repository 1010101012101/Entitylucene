How to get my networked drives to also work on Mountain Lion? <body> I have a networked drive on the XP side of my MacBook. I use a VPN and then can login to the drive. Nothing too special going on. I believe the server uses Active Directory.  There isn't a ton of info I have to enter. The code\\server.local.blah/code blah and some IP info.  I have never been able to get these to mount or show up and authenticate on the Mac side. I can use the network connect to login to the VPN, but directory access has always been a no-go.  <answer62156> If the VPN is working and the same as on the Windows side, you should be able to enter the server details in the strongGo  Connect to Server/strong (âŒ˜K) dialog in Finder. If it's a standard Windows file share, just enter in codesmb://server.local.blah/code and it should connect.  However if that doesn't work, you'll need to provide more details on how your VPN and servers are set up.  <comment71890> Worked like a charm!
