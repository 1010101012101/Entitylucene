Change Date Created based on the filename <body> I've downloaded a bunch of my Instagram images but the Date Created of the files is set to the time that I initiated the download. What I do have though is the Date Created in the filename. What I want to do is take the date in the filename, which I've changed to YYYYMMDDhhmm, and set that as the creation date of each file.  I changed the date in the filename into the YYYYMMDDhhmm because this is the format that the codetouch -t/code command likes. Now all I need is a way to take the first 12 characters of the filename, pass it to codetouch -t/code as the date to touch the file with and follow that with the full filename.   I imagine this could be accomplished with a combination of Hazel and a shell/AppleScript so that the date could be passed on from each individual image.  Cheers for any help :)  <answer61429> So after some hunting I stumbled on this little AppleScript on Mac OS X Hints. Thanks Krioni! I'm sure with some tinkering I could modify it to work with my filenames, but I just batch edited the image filenames to fit in with the script.  precodeon open files_     repeat with file_ in files_         tell application "Finder"             set file_name to name of file_             set od to AppleScript's text item delimiters             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {"_"}             set new_creation_date to second text item of file_name             set new_creation_date to new_creation_date &amp; "1000"             set file_ to POSIX path of file_             do shell script "touch -t " &amp; new_creation_date &amp; " " &amp; quoted form of file_             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to od         end tell     end repeat end open /code/pre  It simply looks for the second text item of the filename in between underscores and uses that as the date. It then adds code"1000"/code as the time to the codetouch/code command. Hopefully this will help someone else out there.  The original thread can be found here.  <answer78889> codetouch -t/code only changes the creation date if the target (modification) date is before the original creation date.  codefor f in *.jpg; do touch -t ${f% *} "$f" &amp;&amp; mv "$f" "${f#* }"; done/code  codeSetFile -d/code always changes the creation date.  precode-d date    Sets the creation date, where date is a string of the            form: "mm/dd/[yy]yy [hh:mm:[:ss] [AM | PM]]" /code/pre  codefor f in *.jpg; do date=$(printf %s "$f" | sed -E 's|^(....)(..)(..)(..)(..).*|\2/\3/\1/ \4:\5|'); SetFile -m "$date" -d "$date" "$f" &amp;&amp; mv "$f" "${f#* }"; done/code  SetFile is part of the command line tools package which can be downloaded from developer.apple.com/downloads or Xcode's preferences.  <comment70764> Now if only `touch -t` would change the creation date, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/49154/9058 ... Do you want to change the creation or the modification date? Both is possible, but the solution is different. <comment70765> The creation date. In my manual tests, if i was to type `touch -t 201010201000 /Users/smithjw/Dropbox/Extracted/instagram/test/201010201000\ 1287551285.jpg` the creation date would be modified. <comment70766> That's the modification date, see `man touch`. Use `ls -lU` to display the creation date. <comment70767> Well I don't know what was happening on my system but it changed the creation date, as well as the modification date, when I used `touch -t` <comment70768> What exactly do the file names look like? Is it just the date? Is the date first and followed by a space? A dash? Are they at the end? <comment70770> The filenames are all like this `201010301000 1288442222.jpg`, where the first 12 characters are the date/time <comment70806> Have a look at [basename](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/basename.1.html). You could use it to strip the file name down to what you need.
