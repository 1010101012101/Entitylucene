creating a network interface based on tun0 <body> I want to share my tunnelblick connection via wifi, it seems that in Maverick ipfw is depreciated to pf.  I came across the old solution here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/87442/virtual-network-interface-in-mac-os-x/6375307#6375307  It seems also that the plist has been changed in Mavericks too.  I can't seems to get the ip address from tun0, while setting the Ipv4 ConfigMethod to DHCP would just creating other ethernet connection (with same IP range).  Does anyone know the solution for this problem?  I want to make a network interface, that can be selected via "Share Your Connection From" in Internet Sharing.
