How do I speed up Mac boot to the ready desktop in El capitan <body> My computer has become slow to fully boot since updating to 10.11. This isn't helped by Applications (including their previous windows) reopening automatically post login. I am aware that this is part of the default Mac OS experience and I've seen answers that involve checking a box when restarting, although I would prefer a permanent fix to disable this particular function and any other advice to improve my iMacs startup efficiency.   <comment312292> Permanent stoppage of re open is covered here http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20651/reopen-windows-when-logging-back-in-not <comment312296> @bmike That doesn't cover El Capitan. Thigns have changed since those answers. <comment312312> Are you trying to circumvent "saved application state " entirely or just app launch? If you can call out specifically what step you decided to take from the other linked question and/or refine the specific issue, I'd be inclined to cast a reopen vote. <comment312343> If your question is the same and you need new answers - putting a bounty on the original question is the way the site is designed to work. <comment312849> @bmike That's asking for a temporary solution.
