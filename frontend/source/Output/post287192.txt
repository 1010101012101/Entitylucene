How to disable firewall on server 5.2 <body> I'm unable to get AirPlay video mirroring to work to my AppleTV from my Mac running Server 5.2. This worked before, I think before I installed the server app. My theory is that this is a firewall issue. AirPlay to that AppleTV is working fine from every other computer and device in the house.   I Googled for AirPlay firewall rules, and tried a bunch of them to no avail. I'd like to disable the firewall to see if that fixes it. I'm not worried about the risk of disabling the firewall. I only use the server for VPN, and this machine is behind an external firewall that only allows VPN traffic through. The LAN is all my family's own devices that I trust.   How do you disable the firewall in Server 5.2? There is no option to disable it in the access tab of the server app where firewall rules are specified.
