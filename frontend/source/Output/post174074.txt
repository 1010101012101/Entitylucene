I did a software update & now I can't open Mail <body> I get the following message when I try to open mail  'You can't use this version of Mail with this version of Mac OS x You have Mail version 4.5 (1084/1085). It can't be used on Mac OS X version 10.6.8 )build 10k549)'  I have read the help info   I have made sure Mail.app is in the application folder  Thanks for any help with this   <answer174076> Since you state Mail.app is already in the Applications folder, follow these additional steps:  ol liDownload Safari 5.1.7 for Snow Leopard/li liReinstall the Mac OS X Update v10.6.8 Combo v1.1/li liReinstall Safari 5.1.7 for Snow Leopard/li liReinstall Security Update 2012-004/li /ol  <answer174077> This means Mail, for some reason or another, did not upgrade. Try extracting it from the Installer package or copy it from another computer with the emsame Mac OS X version/em (not reccomended, as permissions can change.)  <answer174091> Somehow, you made a copy of the old Mail.app and it is starting instead of the version in the Applications folder. Control-click on the Mail icon in the dock, then select strongOptions/strong and strongShow in Finder/strong. This will show you the old version that is no longer supported.  <comment204966> You are a LEGEND!! I again have Mail! Thank You!! <comment205060> You're welcome.
