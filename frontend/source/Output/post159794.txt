Swipe between pages doesn't work and unable two fingers scrolling up/down <body> Since this morning, the "swipe between pages" functionality doesn't work anymore on my computer!  strongWeb-browser specific description of the problem/strong  emGoogle Chrome/em  When I try to swipe between pages on Google Chrome, it just does not work. The window get shifted within its frame and come back to its original position.  emSafari/em  When I try to swipe between pages on Safari, the window slightly shifts within its frame and get stuck into this position. Further two-finger movements (including scrolling up and down) are then not functioning. When I open a new window, the scrolling up/down is working again.  emFirefox/em  When I try to swipe between pages on Firefox, nothing happen and further two-finger movements (including scrolling up and down) are then not functioning. When I open a new window, the scrolling up/down is working again.  strongHow I tried to solve this issue/strong  I opened system preferences to make sure that in the section trackpad, the option swipe between pages is activated. Yes, it is activated!  For some reason, I checked the codealways/code box next to codeShow scroll bars/code in the general section in the system preferences.  In Bash, I wrote the following command line: codedefaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.scrollBehavior 2/code but nothing happens!  <answer159801> Try logging out and back in.   I know that sounds like a "grasping at straws"-type solution, but this is the sort of doesn't-make-sense kind of problem that I've seen fixed by logging out (or maybe even restarting).  <comment187799> If the system does not accept your settings, then try to repair the permissions in disk utility. <comment187803> Why didn't I try that before? That solved my problem. Thank you for your help!
