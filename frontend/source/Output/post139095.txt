How can I overwrite a file or prevent 'copy' from being appended? <body> When I copy/paste a file into a folder where a  file with the same name exists, instead of replacing, it changes the filename to 'file Copy'. Is there a way to copy/replace similar to windows or ubuntu?  I am using OSX 10.8.5.  <answer139097> By default in OS X Mavericks, dragging a file into a folder that contains a file with the same name will prompt you for what you would like to do.  Take, for example, these two folders: codeFolder1/code and codeFolder2/code. Both contain a text file called codeTest.txt/code.  Dragging codeTest.txt/code from codeFolder1/code into codeFolder2/code will result in this dialog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9JCGj.png" alt="Copy/Replace"  "Keep Both" will result in the file being named codeTest copy.txt/code. "Replace" does exactly what you want - replaces codeFolder2/Test.txt/code with codeFolder1/code's codeTest.txt/code.  hr  As user dval has discovered, earlier versions of OS X may require that you hold down kbdâŒ˜/kbd while you drag a file into another folder in order to see the "Replace" option.  <comment164081> Is there anyway to mimic that behavior in older osx versions?  I only see that dialog if I am dragging multiple files. It seems like an inconsistency in the OS. For a single file, if I drag or cmd-c/cmd-v, it just renames without prompt. <comment164082> I am unsure - I only have Mavericks installed on my machines. Try dragging while holding option. Or holding cmd? Try them all! <comment164097> @aglasser I like your style - "Try them all"  <comment164100> cmd seemed to bring up the dialog. now, it works as expected. Thanks <comment164102> I'm glad to help.
