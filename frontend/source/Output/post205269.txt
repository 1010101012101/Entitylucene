Script OSX Color Picker to choose a specific color and exit <body> Looking for a way to AppleScript the native (?) OSX Color Picker displayed in Evernote so that I can set a specific color and exit.  Use case: Would like to create scripts to mark selected text red, green, and black. I will use Automator or tool like Fastscripts or Keyboard Maestro to trigger these scripts via hotkeys. My goal is to quickly re-color selected text without having to use the mouse.  <answer205284> You can use Keyboard Maestro's mouse actions to find an image on the screen (such as the colour wheel), then a defined pixel coordinate within the found image to click on. This will therefore select the same colour regardless of where the window is located.  <comment247531> Cool use case. If you open up Script Editor, does there look to be any dictionaries for hooks when you examine the evernote app? <comment247592> I could not find anything specific to the color picker. <comment247593> I was hoping for a nice, clean AppleScript solution (I've googled far and wide) but surprisingly this appears to be the only technique for hacking keyboard color selection in OSX. Thank you.
