Bridge with VPN capabilities <body> I'm want my Apple TV to be part of the local network but use a VPN for any Internet traffic.  This is my current network setup: Internet &lt;-ethernet- Airport Extreme/Rest of Network &lt;-ethernet- Apple TV  My iTunes library is on a Mac mini that I basically use as a server.  My idea is to change the layout to this (Mac mini has two ethernet ports): Internet &lt;-ethernet- Airport Extreme/Rest of Network &lt;-ethernet- Mac mini &lt;-ethernet- Apple TV  I was hoping that I could use the Mac mini as a bridge for all local traffic. That way broadcasts etc. can still come through. But I want any internet traffic from/to Apple TV to go through a VPN that is setup on the Mac mini.  Question 1: Do you think that's the best way to achieve my goal?  Question 2: If so - how do you set it up?  I found this: Using Server 5.0.15 to share internet WITHOUT internet sharing It explains very well how to use macOS as a router. And I would be able to adjust it so that the VPN connection is used. But I won't have my wanted bridge for local traffic, right?  Thanks for your help! Dan  <comment332880> Why wouldn't it be able to function for local traffic? (I don't know if it would or wouldn't). <comment332891> I have the same set up basically. I use an older Mac than functions as a server for my Apple TV. I use a VPN on it. I connect it to my router and then assign a static IP to it for the LAN setup. My Apple TV, also connected to the router, has a default network configuration. Works like a charm. <comment332907> @NoahL I figured when I setup a route from AppleTV to VPN tunnel I think that all traffic (including local) will be in the VPN tunnel. Thus my local library on Mac mini wouldn't be accessable from Apple TV any more. <comment332908> @njboot Awesome, so it's possible :-) But how do you make sure Apple TV connects to the internet via VPN?
