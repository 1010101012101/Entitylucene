Missing App After Downloading <body> I've downloaded Tumblr on to my iPad 2 and the button in the App Store now shows OPEN.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jvnGp.jpg" alt="App Store"  But when I tap the 'OPEN' button, nothing appears (it's just the same!)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQNoq.jpg" alt="OPEN button selected"  I checked it again after resetting the home screen view so it's arranged. I searched for 'T' and there's no Tumblr!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lp0GJ.jpg" alt="Home screen"  Maybe it's bit blurry, but there's all the apps which started with T. I've searched in the search Spotlight too but also, nothing appears with 'Tumblr'.  <answer139404> Reboot the device by holding both the power and home button until the Apple logo is shown. This will reset the SpringBoard cache which should show the app on the home screen if it's been downloaded (and in Spotlight).  <comment164386> Reboot your device <comment164603> IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
