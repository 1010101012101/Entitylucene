iOS 8.1 Iphone 6 Mail Client can't open links using Chrome <body> The default mail client can't seem to open email links using chrome at all. I have deactivated safari.  Is this  a glitch? Should I stop using the default client?  Thanks.  <answer152278> Since you can't choose a default browser other than Safari (without a Jailbreak) it is the normal behaviour.   <comment179187> How could you deactivate Safari ??? <comment179245> Isn't that horrible behaviour?  It opens up links only in Safari? <comment294527> @MatthieuRiegler Parental Controls <comment300705> @Marin Yes there is no way to change the system-wide browser on iOS currently.
