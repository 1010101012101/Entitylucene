Why can't I add a new playlist? <body> I've created a new playlist in my iTunes library since enabling iCloud Library, I've noticed I get a Cloud with strikethrough image next to the playlist name. When clicking on this icon I get the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/clhmI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can someone explain why this playlist is returing errors? The playlist contains a mixture of mp3's and m4a files.
