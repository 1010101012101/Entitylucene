SaaS subscription across iOS, Android and Web <body> We have three different forms of distribution for our SaaS (Web, Android and iOS) all currently reviewed and in-store in their free form ($0).  Our business model is focussed around a single subscription across all platforms and was hoping to use our existing system of Stripe  Webhook to updates all services of a users status.  Heads down in the development has overlooked the very confusing, constantly changing and expensive (70/30 split!) guidelines that Apple publishes.  We've developed blindly as looking at apps like Dropbox and many others offer the same subscription / account across all platforms.  My questions is how are they doing it? IAP? External subscription? From the guidelines you are not allowed to link to a 'Buy / Subscribe' button.  <answer186329> You're not allowed to emlink/em to an external payment method, but saying that the app requires payment outside of the app is fine.  For example, mentioning in the app description that the app “requires a valid subscription to emx/em” is acceptable, whereas having a link inside the app to “purchase your subscription here” is not unless that purchase is through IAP.  <comment220089> Well I would vote this up if I had enough rep... seems SO doesn't carry over to here... <comment220090> @Taylorsuk Thanks; once you earn 200 reputation somewhere, you get a bonus of 100 everywhere else. <comment220093> Ok need 4 more on SO then I'm good :) cheers <comment220095> @Taylorsuk There you go then :) <comment220097> Nice...another 44k to catch you!
