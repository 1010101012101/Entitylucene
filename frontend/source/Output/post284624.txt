iPad Air Digitalizer and LCD Replacement <body> I swapped out the digitizer for iPad Air, but ended up breaking the LCD in the process.  After buying a new LCD, I still had no picture. I tried plugging it into my computer to see if it is recognized, but it wasn't. After putting the old LCD back in, most things seem fine, it's recognized by the computer, however I see no picture, just lines. I unplugged the LCD and I plugged in the new one. Voila, I have Picture. But as soon as I turn it off completely there is nothing I start at zero. I have to plug my old LCD so that I can get any picture at all. I don't know what else to think can you please help me. PS: I ordered 2 different LCD screens, and still have the same problem.  I am unsure as to how I can get the LCD to work right off the bat.  Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks.
