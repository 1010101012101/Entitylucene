Wi-Fi disconnects when I lock the mac <body> Everytime I lock my mac and log back in two minutes, It has disconnected the wi-fi network. Is there a setting to disable this?  Model: Mac Book Pro - 15-inch, Mid 2010 I lock it by clicking 'Login Window...' after clicking my username on top right corner of the menu bar.  <answer72590> hr  strongEDIT/strong: Please see John's answer above, which basically says to open Terminal and run:  precodecd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources sudo ./airport en1 prefs DisconnectOnLogout=NO /code/pre  where codeen1/code is the name of your Mac's WiFi interface. You can get it with this Terminal command:  precodeifconfig | grep -B 6 'status: active' | head -n 1 | cut -d : -f 1 /code/pre  when WiFi is the only active interface (that is, no Ethernet cable attached).  To list the interface settings, run in Terminal:  precode./airport en1 prefs /code/pre  Typical output is:  precodeAirPort preferences for en1:  DisconnectOnLogout=NO Unable to retrieve JoinMode JoinModeFallback=DoNothing RememberRecentNetworks=YES RequireAdminIBSS=NO RequireAdminNetworkChange=NO RequireAdminPowerToggle=NO WoWEnabled=YES /code/pre  hr  Other people's Macs are misbehaving in a similar way, read for example this and this. Although I own a similar MacBook Pro that runs 10.8.2 I can count myself fortunate not to suffer this issue.  Consequently the list below is rather a compilation of possible fixes (some may even seem absurd or just plain obvious) than tested recommendations:  ul liLock the screen differently, for instance with a 3rd party program (http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/2000041, applies to Mac OS X 10.7.5) (I use hot corners for that)./li liSome claim that Apple WiFi equipment spares them from suffering this issue (maybe because an old, possibly incompatible base station was replaced?)  (http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=15380401&amp;postcount=57 and http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=15442704&amp;postcount=63)./li liAdd a new network location (http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/02/fix-os-x-mountain-lion-wireless-connection-problems/)./li liChange MTU size to prevent dropped connections (also http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/02/fix-os-x-mountain-lion-wireless-connection-problems/).  (These two don't relate exactly to disconnects after locking but more generally to connectivity problems in "Mountain Lion".)/li liAs a last resort, a clean install (restoring applications/settings from Time Machine) might help./li /ul  I checked the power management settings (command codepmset/code) and codedefaults/code but couldn't find anything.  (My setup is: clean "Mountain Lion" install (with restore from Time Machine) and Airport Express base station.)  Hope this will help...  <answer77376> Try the workaround here: http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/2000041     The problem with OS X is to "lock" your screen you have two options, either let the screen saver time out and lock your screen (which doesn't disconnect WIFI) or clicking on your "user name" on the top right corner and choosing "Login Window" which essentially locks your mac and takes you to a login window, however this approach disconnects the WIFI Connection.      The work around I have found is installing an app called "Lock Me Now" from the app store and once it has been installed launch it and from the preferences "check" "Just Lock" under "Lock Type" which does the same thing as the screen saver timing out. Also for ease of use you can assign a keyboard shortcut to simplify the process of locking your Mac (I chose to use Command + L )   <answer97047> Do the following:  Find out what the network interface is for your wifi. Mine is "en1" for this example (I have obfuscated my MAC addresses with "00")  precodeifconfig en1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500   ether 00:00:00:00:00:00   inet6 0000::000:0000:0000:0000%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x5 inet 10.0.1.16 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.1.255 media: autoselect status: active /code/pre  Then, you need to set up the airport util for your wireless card to tell it not to shut off:  precodecd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources sudo ./airport en1 prefs DisconnectOnLogout=NO /code/pre  <answer124242> You can live without "lock me now" app.  just use:  strongCTRL + SHIFT + 'key to eject cd'/strong (or if you don't have an eject key, codectrl+shift+power/code)  <answer133048> Open codeApplications &gt; Utilities &gt; Keychain Access/code then go to emKeychain Access/em in the menu bar on the top, then emPreferences/em - click "emshow keychain status in the menu bar/em".  You will see a little lock on the menu bar ... click on it then lock screen from there.  <answer159641> For maverick users-  To enabled the "Open Wireless Diagnostics.." as it doesn't show up by default to diagnose the WIFI connection.  Click the wifi icon on the menu bar with the Option key pressed. On the bottom of the list, you have "Open Wireless Diagnostics..."  <answer180192> You can do it by writing simple service for Mac, this is best solution for this problem.  Try this out -http://tecride.blogspot.in/2015/04/wifi-disconnects-when-you-lock-osx.html  <answer224031> For OS X 10.9, instead of locking your Mac consider using the following command in terminal:   precodeopen -a /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app /code/pre  The command starts the codeScreenSaveEngine.app/code which locks the screen without disconnecting the Wi-Fi. I am not sure if it works on other versions of OS X.  <comment123383> I really don't know why this isn't the accepted answer, this was exactly the problem I was having. Thanks! <comment123774> I realized that my initial problem was actually resolved by this, but the workaround I had built worked better with @John's answer. I'm going back to yours, though, as it makes it easier to lock my desktop and walk away without worrying about everything turning off while I'm gone. : ) Thanks! <comment145282> what do you mean by "lock me now"? <comment145958> Yep. This works! :-) <comment148672> Pretty sure he means the above mentioned program in the app store.  His suggestion does the same thing without having to have an app. <comment152389> Unfortunately this method also drops the network on MBPr's <comment152390> This didn't work on my 2013 MBPr, unfortunately. <comment159363> Worked - this should be correct answer. <comment164481> Didn't work on late 2013 MBPr. <comment200544> Didnt work for me neither, seems there is a difference between choosing "show login window" and "lock screen" that you cannot get around. See Sul's answer about keychain prefs. <comment201516> Did not work on 2013 MBA. <comment207452> what if it's not a wireless card? (ethernet via thunderbolt). What would be the path? <comment207453> I use this all the time, and I still get disconnected from my network. <comment213919> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment256252> This worked for me ... as long as I remember to lock my screen by hitting "command alt power" and NOT "command control power" :) <comment256258> (for followers, command control power is "reboot" so don't do that. If you don't have an eject button, "lock screen" shortcut is `ctrl+shift+power`) <comment257777> Unfortunately this wasn't enough for me (encryption type "WPA2 Enterprise" however at home using Wifi "WPA2 Personal" it stays connected just fine). FWIW <comment264452> This is the only answer that actually works without requiring the user to completely change his/her workflow. <comment272110> Does not work for me on a 2015 MBP running 10.11 and locking via command option power. <comment272112> This is the best answer for me (2015 MBP, OS 10.11), though I'm disappointed that I need to learn a new lock shortcut. <comment287873> Just trying this on MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). I'm wondering if the reason it hasn't worked for some others is that for me, at least,the Wifi adapter is en0, not en1. <comment344357> Doesn't work for me on 2012 MBP running Sierra. <comment344362> One comment, most third party programs only lock the main screen - if you have a second monitor, or someone can attach one, they're useless. <comment344363> The problem is, this is a security risk, as it displays your username publicly when you wake it, even if you have your login window set not to. <comment344364> As I commented above, this will show your username to anyone trying to unlock your Mac, even if you have your login window set not to. That's a security risk.
