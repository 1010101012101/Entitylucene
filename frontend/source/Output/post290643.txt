Install macOS Sierra on VirtualBox? <body> I’m trying to install macOS Sierra on VirtualBox, but can’t seem to make it work. For reference, here are the steps I took.  ol liDownloaded the Install macOS Sierra app from the App Store./li liUsed the inbuilt media creation executable, codeCreateInstallMedia/code on a disk image./li liCreated a new VM with the default settings for an OS X El Capitan, plus 128 VRAM./li liSince VirtualBox refused to accept the DMG, I tried splicing out the InstallESD./li liVirtualBox now accepted it, but wouldn’t boot. I tried to boot through rEFInd, but still no luck./li liI tried to patch it both ways (base system and ESD) with iesd. No luck./li liWhen booting to GParted LiveCD, it flat-out refused to discover any of the installer CDs./li /ol  How can I patch the installer to work with VirtualBox? I don’t want to use pre-patched versions of either the installer or an existing installation, as though to avoid piracy.  <comment366888> Check [Install El Capitan with VirtualBox on OS X](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/233788/93229) how to create a bootable image. This should also work for Sierra (after changing the app/path names in the scripts from ...El Capitan... to Sierra)
