How can I make screenshots be true pixels? <body> It seems like all my screenshots end up being twice as many pixels as they should even though I run the screen in 1920x1200. If I screenshot this editing box, via kbdcommand/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbd4/kbd it says about 600px across, but the screenshot ends up being about 1200px. See:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3DQiJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I remedy this?  <answer88151> This is to be expected, as your Retina MBP has an actual pixel resolution of 3840x2400.  You can downscale your screenshots manually, or use an app like RetinaCapture, which takes a full-sized and a downscaled screenshot at the same time.
