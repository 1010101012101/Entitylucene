iPhone 4s black screen after resetting content and settings <body> I currently own an iPhone 4s, which I decided to try and reset due to a weird behavior of its display.  This mobile is jailbroken. I have tried to resetting it through codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset All Content and Settings/code after entering my Apple ID password, the display turned to the Apple logo and started showing the spinning circle, which I assume is the iPhone's way of saying I'm currently working on your request.  After a few moments of waiting, I noticed the spinning circle disappeared and the screen is still lit but does not show anything, just a black screen. I tried to hold down the power button in hope that the phone would shutdown.  I also tried entering iTunes recovery mode but it seems that no button on my phone is responding. My computer also is not recognizing any devices plugged in when I try to plug my iPhone to the USB port.  Any idea how I can shut this phone down and enter recovery mode?  <comment362787> Have you tried pressing and holding the sleep/wake and home buttons?
