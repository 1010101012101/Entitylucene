hdiutil convert not working and not telling me why <body> I've been trying to create a bootable Ubuntu flash drive following instructions from multiple sites. I need to convert the .iso file to an .img using hdiutil. For starters, the syntax of the command is very unclear. The ubuntu site and the -help option of hdiutil say codehdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso/code but the codeman hdiutil/code says codehdiutil convert ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img/code. I have tried both ways and neither has worked. I don't get any sort of error message, and I know my paths are correct (when I try with an incorrect path it says so). The only thing printed in the terminal is  precodeUsage:  hdiutil convert -format &lt;format&gt; -o &lt;outfile&gt; [options] &lt;image&gt;     hdiutil convert -help /code/pre  Does anyone have any suggestions?  <answer271929> Use ETCG drivemaker file, much easier.  Heres the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQIaDO9nR6Y&amp;t=421s  <comment262526> Either format should work, so I suspect there's something else wrong. Are there any spaces in the filenames? Is it possible you're using some fancy (and shell-incompatible) unicode characters (fancy dashes, nonbreaking spaces, something like that)? <comment341803> Welcome to Ask Different!
