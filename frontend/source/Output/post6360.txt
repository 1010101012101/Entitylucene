How do I stop iTunes from automatically backing up the iPad? <body> I'm trying to move some pictures from my laptop to my iPad, but every time the first thing iTunes starts doing is making a backup of the iPad.  But since I already keep a backup at my desktop, I want iTunes to back off and just let me move the pictures!  So how can I prevent iTunes from making automatic backups?  Woops, missed on tiny detail: I'm using Windows 7! But feel free to leave OSX solutions as well  <answer6363> strongMac Answer:/strong  You can disable device backups with this terminal command:     codedefaults write com.apple.iTunes DeviceBackupsDisabled -bool true/code   More info here.  <answer6366> strongPC Answer:/strong  You can edit the iTunesPrefs.xml file to disable backups on Windows.brThis article has directions.  <answer38995> With iOS 5, it is possible to back up to iCloud.

Just posted a Windows way. <comment323398> Fantastic straight-to-the-point answer for Mac OS X. <comment323399> This does not stop the *backups* from happening when a sync is manually initiated. The OP is not complaining about auto-syncing, they are only concerned with turning off the repetitive & unnecessary *backing up during each sync*.
