Where are Time Machine local backups/snapshots stored? <body> Out of curiosity, I'm wondering where in the file system Time Machine stores its local backups/snapshots.  <answer115869> They are stored on your hard drive in the folder entitled:  precode/Volumes/MobileBackups /code/pre  <answer123254> The actual data is stored in a hidden directory called code.MobileBackups/code at the root of the volume.  There is a special virtual filesystem type called codemtmfs/code which translates the raw data in these hidden directories into a virtual Time Machine drive which is automatically mounted on code/Volumes/MobileBackups/code  <comment135583> This seems likely to be a common question. Have you tried looking to see if there's already an answer to this on the site? <comment272507> Not sure if this works for El Captain anymore, I can't find anything at least. I cd'd into volumes and did a ls -a (which shows all files, so including the hidden ones, in a directory) which gave nothing, tried this in both recovery and normal boot mode. Did the same thing for the root volume. <comment292197> I can still see it on my El Capitan laptop (10.11.4).  `/Volumes/MobileBackups` exists and has a `Backups.backupdb` directory inside it.  It's still a `mtmfs` mount according to `mount`,  and I'm pretty sure the actual data is still stored in `/.MobileBackups` but the format has changed.
