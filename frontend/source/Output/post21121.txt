How to start/join microsoft office live meeting on mac <body> How can we join/start live meeting on my macbook pro. I have microsoft office installed.  Do i need any other software also.  <answer21128> It seems you can use Live Meeting Web Access to join, but not host meetings.  http://blogs.technet.com/b/msonline/archive/2010/05/25/how-to-use-your-mac-with-sharepoint-online-and-live-meeting.aspx  <answer21137> You might want to consider using the excellent Adobe Connect web-based screen-share/collaboration tool: truly cross-platform (hell, it supports PS3) and overall a better feature set.  http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html  <answer21162> Also note that Microsoft Live Meeting works in Safari but not on Chrome. At least on my MacBookPro and Leopard. In case you have other browser than Safari set as a default browser, you'll need to copy-paste the LiveMeeting link into Safari  <comment23160> thanks for quick reply. So https://www323.livemeeting.com/cc/niso/loginPage this is the URL of web based live meeting. <comment23161> On live meeting invitation mail i clicked on "join the meeting" and nothing happened. Do i need anything else to install. <comment23162> Sorry, I just looked that up on the web. I don't have any experience with Microsoft products on the Mac, so don't know if you need any additional software. <comment23191> On safari i am getting error "safari can't open the specified address"
