Disable Services in OSX (services.msc) <body> Is there a Services.msc or ntsysv utility for OSX? I just want to harden my OSX by disabling any unwanted service and it's ports.  <answer105897> The OS X equivalent of Windows services is Launchd. The OS X equivalent of codeservices.msc/code on Windows is launchctl. The daemons managed by launchd can be on demand or can be triggered periodically (this is configurable in launchd.plist)  You can manage the daemons from the command line (from codeTerminal.app/code under code/Applications/Utilities//code) or by using a tool like Lingon.  From the command line:    ul liList agents/jobs loaded using  precodelaunchctl list /code/pre/li liRemove an agent/job using  precodelaunchctl remove &lt;name&gt; /code/pre/li liDisable an agent/job for the currently booted session alone using  precodelaunchctl unload &lt;name&gt; /code/pre/li liLoad an agent/job manually using  precodelaunchctl load &lt;name&gt; /code/pre/li /ul  See the above linked pages for information.  Additional references:    ul liDaemons and Services Programming Guide/li licodeman launchctl/code in codeTerminal.app/code (or the online manual for launchctl)/li licodeman launchd/code in codeTerminal.app/code (or the online manual for launchd)/li licodeman launchd.plist/code in codeTerminal.app/code (or the online manual for launchd.plist)/li lilaunchd on Wikipedia/li /ul  <comment124497> So effectively Launchd is the init.d equivalent and launchctl something like ntsysv? <comment124503> Yes, but launchctl is a command line tool (intended to be used from a terminal shell), unlike ntsysv that provides a graphical list. <comment124594> I am still finding it very hard to understand how Agents and Daemons work. I think that Daemons are more closer to Services. Are all Daemons work on Demand? meaning that they will only enable them selves when called by a program and then close, something like ssh. However, how can I figure out which Daemons/Agents are live and exposing their ports? Should I run Netstat and then disable those Daemons if not needed? <comment124596> The terms daemons and agents are sometimes used interchangeably. Per Apple's documentation, daemons cover system and user processes while agents are more about user processes. The daemons managed by launchd can be on demand or can be triggered periodically (this is configurable in launchd.plist). <comment124597> Use the command listed above - `launchctl list` to see the list of daemons. You can also use `Activity Monitor` to see all processes. Most of them use a convention of ending the name with "d", like launchd, syslogd and so on. <comment124598> If you'd like to control network connections by processes, you could also look at third party apps like Little Snitch. I'm updating my answer with more information on services, but if the scope of your question is different, please post a separate question to make it easy for people to answer. <comment324116> Lingon app is the bomb! Easily disabled all unnecessary scripts. Thanks a lot, you just made my work laptop more home friendly. 3
