How do I pass the following error message in the Boot Camp Assistant: "Please format the USB drive as single FAT partition."? <body> I am running the Boot Camp Assistant on El Capitan. Whenever I reach the third screen, titled "Save Windows Support Software", on which I can select an storage medium to save the Windows support software to, I am shown the following error message upon selecting a disk and hitting "Continue":  "Please format the USB drive as single FAT partition.".  I am using a Transcend 16GB USB drive. I have formatted it as FAT through Disk Utility. I have tried every possible partition scheme. I have also tried formatting the drive as Ex-Fat, again in combination with all three partition schemes. I keep seeing the error message. There seem to be a fair number of people who have encountered the same issue, and for some it was resolved by formatting the drive as FAT with a MBR partition scheme. For others however this did not work.  Any advice on how to make the Boot Camp Assistant accept my USB drive would be much appreciated.  <answer232996> After some trial and error, I finally figured out what the problem was and found a solution. Hopefully this will help those who come across this thread with the same problem.  The problem: Reformatting using Disk Utility did not create a child partition, but only formatted the whole drive as FAT. In Disk Utility one can derive this from the "Partition" button being greyed out when the USB drive is selected. In Terminal, the codediskutil list/code command shows the USB drive having only one DeviceNode (labelled code0/code).  The solution: Reformatting the USB drive using codediskutil/code in Terminal. This is the command line equivalent of Disk Utility, but unlike its GUI Counterpart, it creates a child partition, which in turn solves the error thrown by Boot Camp Assistant.  WARNING: Proceed with caution! If you have never used a command line interface before, you might want to ask a tech-savvy friend for help. I take no responsibility for the outcome of this. If you fry your hardware in the process, that's on you. Good luck!  Stepwise:  ol liOpen the Terminal application. You can find it by searching Spotlight for "Terminal" (sans quotes)./li liIn Terminal, type codediskutil list/code and hit enter./li liLook at the results and determine the identifier of your target USB drive. It will look like this: code/dev/diskX/code. If you have only one external drive connected, this should be easy to figure out (hint: behind the identifier it says code(internal, ...)/code or code(external, ...)/code)./li liRun the following command to reformat your USB drive: codediskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskX 1 MBR fat32 NAME 8G/code. Replace code/dev/diskX/code with the identifier of your drive which you obtained in the previous step. Replace codeNAME/code with the name you want to give the partition (which essentially doesn't matter). Make it all CAPS to avoid problems. Replace code8/code in code8G/code with the number of Gigabytes you want your partition to have. It's easiest to just go with the total size of your USB drive./li liWait for it to complete./li liVerify the output. The end of the command's output should show the formatting of your drive. You should see two DeviceNodes: code0/code, of type codeFDisk_partition_scheme/code, and code1/code, of type codeDOS_FAT_32/code and with the identifier codediskXs1/code where codeX/code is a digit corresponding to the identifier you found in step 3./li liRun Boot Camp Assistant again and be happy because it finally works like a charm./li /ol  <answer236852> To most easily resolve this, you need to erase your USB drive with a "Master Boot Record" scheme.  Steps:  ol liOpen Disk Utility/li liSelect the USB drive/li liClick "Erase"/li liChoose Format "MS-DOS (FAT)"/li libMOST IMPORTANT/b: Choose Scheme "Master Boot Record"/li liClick Erase button/li /ol  Many thanks to nholtappels for figuring out the problem!  <comment284784> What was the actual cause of the problem? Was the flash drive somehow manipulated  before, so that it wasn't possible to re-partition it with Disk Utility? Or is it a model-specific problem? Also, is this an El Capitan-specific problem? <comment324136> @DictionaricsAnonymous I, too, had this exact problem, and I am as mystified as the OP as to why Disk Utility did not create the correct partition in the first place. I am using an 8 GB USB stick that was a giveaway at some business event, so certainly not something that was manipulated in any special way. FWIW, I'm on Mac OS X 10.11.6 on a "Late 2013" model MacBook Pro. The Boot Camp Assistant about dialog shows version 6.0.1 (6024.40.2).
