How to resolve app uninstall without adhoc <body> When I installed the app with help of this link onto my device but this procedure has problems under iOS 7 which i have reported to apple but i'm wondering if someone knows of a fix in the mean time?  When you click the link to install, the app installing icons appears and after a short time a second icon appears with the proper app icon but the install one does not disappear (see image below) even if i delete the app the installing icon stays. Any ideas on how to fix this would be much appreciated.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xAcv5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer130827> A few suggestions:     ol   liLoad a earlier Backup from the iCloud and "restore" it to this state/li   liLog Out of your Apple Account and reboot. /li   liConnect your iPhone via cable with your PC/Mac and sync your apps/li   /ol   <comment153492> Is your phone jailbroken? <comment153493> no and My iphone Model is 5s @patrix <comment153501> Thanks. but i need how to uninstall that app on my device <comment153502> Oops, sorry, misread the question.
