Problems installing Ruby versions via RVM in Mountain Lion <body> So I recently joined the Mac world and bought a MacBook - which I love, by the way.  I'm having some trouble getting all my dev tools up setup properly and am not quite 100% familiar with the differences in the Linux CLI and the OSX CLI.  Right now, I'm trying to install a few different versions of Ruby via RVM.  I've tried getting gcc4.2 as I've seen recommended, but regardless of what compiler I use I get similar messages. In this I'm trying to install the 2.0.0-preview2, but I get the same messages for other versions also:  precode$ rvm install 2.0.0-preview2 No binary rubies available for: downloads/ruby-2.0.0-preview2. Continuing with compilation. Please read 'rvm mount' to get more information on binary rubies.

Mac OS X already provides this software and installing another version in parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.  The OpenSSL provided by OS X is too old for some software.  /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1c (429 files, 15M) https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/openssl.rb /code/pre  Could someone point me in the right direction? I feel like I'm missing something obvious.  Thanks in advance.  <answer75789> Solved by re-installing Xcode, CLI tools, openssl (brew), autoconf (brew), automake (brew) and apple-gcc42 (brew). After re-installing I ran codervm get head/code (thanks to @mpapis in #rvm on freenode). codervm get head/code gave me the following:  precode  * WARNING: you have 'rvm_configure_env' in /etc/rvmrc, run the following to fix:        sudo sed -i'' -e "s#rvm_configure_env=('LDFLAGS=-L/opt/sm/pkg/active/lib CFLAGS=-I/opt/sm/pkg/active/include CPATH=/opt/sm/pkg/active/include')#rvm_configure_env=('LDFLAGS=-L/opt/sm/pkg/active/lib' 'CFLAGS=-I/opt/sm/pkg/active/include' 'CPATH=/opt/sm/pkg/active/include')#" /etc/rvmrc    * No new notes to display.  # RVM:  Shell scripts enabling management of multiple ruby environments. # RTFM: https://rvm.io/ # HELP: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rvm (#rvm on irc.freenode.net) # Cheatsheet: http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/rvm/ # Screencast: http://screencasts.org/episodes/how-to-use-rvm  # In case of any issues read output of 'rvm requirements' and/or 'rvm notes'  Upgrade of RVM in /usr/local/rvm/ is complete.  # hinmn, # #   Thank you for using RVM! #   I sincerely hope that RVM helps to make your life easier and #   more enjoyable!!! # # ~Wayne  RVM reloaded! /code/pre  After that I just ran:   precodesudo sed -i'' -e "s#rvm_configure_env=('LDFLAGS=-L/opt/sm/pkg/active/lib CFLAGS=-I/opt/sm/pkg/active/include CPATH=/opt/sm/pkg/active/include')#rvm_configure_env=('LDFLAGS=-L/opt/sm/pkg/active/lib' 'CFLAGS=-I/opt/sm/pkg/active/include' 'CPATH=/opt/sm/pkg/active/include')#" /etc/rvmrc /code/pre  And everything worked out :)  <answer85760> I had similar problems and it turned out I didn't have some packages installed, mainly these:  precodelibxslt @1.1.27_0 (active) libyaml @0.1.4_1 (active) llvm-3.2 @3.2_1 (active) llvm_select @0.2_0 (active) /code/pre  llvm-3.2 is the gcc compiler I believe was the main problem because openssl wasn't able to run ./Configure and Make.  Check if these are installed first and maybe it'll help before having to reinstall everything. Took me 2 days to get Ruby 2.0.0 / Rails 3.1.1 working, hope this helps someone.  <comment87492> While I can not help you with the current question at hand, I would like to make a recommendation: Rephrase your question to have a short synopsis *in the first lines*, and *then* go into detail. Also, it might be easier to get answers if you break up your problem into several questions. Good luck! <comment87979> Further note: I have a feeling if I had run `rvm get head` earlier, I may have avoided installing/re-installing some of the packages. <comment97459> I concur - simply doing `rvm get head` followed by `brew update` and `brew install ...` (bunch of missing packages) did the trick for me. <comment97777> Yeah, I haven't had any problems since I got everything working. I was definitely having a hard time for a while though. rvm on Linux 'just works' in my experience. <comment98849> I thought Homebrew would automatically install all required packages
