Ssh app on iPad runs bash script <body> ServerAuditor is a free iPad app that allows ssh to a server. I am trying to copy my public key to a server to allow password less login. On a pc this is easy- Generate the rsa key open terminal and  precodea@A:~&gt; cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B 'cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys' b@B's password: /code/pre  Enter the password and I'm good.  This app however has the following script where $1 is .ssh and $2 is authorized keys and $3 is the public key  precodeif test ! -e $1; then mkdir $1; chmod 700 $1; fi; if test ! -e $1/$2; then touch $1/$2; chmod 600 $1/$2; fi; echo $3 &gt;&gt; $1/$2 /code/pre  I think I know what the bash script is doing but why does it change the permissions?  <answer227519> Because SSH credentials should never be group- or world-readable.  The fact that the server(s) you administer are incorrectly configured and do not enforce this is not a good thing.  <comment277446> thank you. from what i have read other people chmod to 604.
