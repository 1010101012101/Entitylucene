Safari extension to monitor web pages for changes? <body> I am looking for a Safari extension similar to Update Scanner (for Firefox) and Page Monitor (for Chrome). Any suggestions?  <answer50583> I don't know any extension like this one, but I've used Changes Meter which works really fine. It's a small app in your menubar and gets the job done.  <answer64802> Changes Meter is an app that just notify you about some change in web page. But it does not inform you about what has changed.  <answer152082> I've found this old software that might do the trick Safari Page Monitor   <answer173533> Using a browser extension for this means it will only notify you when your browser is online.  I use http://changemon.com which notifies me 24x7 and it's quite simple to use.  You don't even have to sign up on the site.  <answer240205> I'm using https://urlooker.com, it has free plan, shows exact changes and supports JS-generated pages.  <comment57975> I had never thought of looking for a separate application rather than a web browser extension. Works just as well. Thanks! <comment76421> Can you please provide a link to the tool mentioned? <comment295129> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.
