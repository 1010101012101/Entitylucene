Missing Canon Printer driver for OSX Mavericks? <body> I hooked up a Canon Pixma MP160 printer/scanner to a machine running OSX Mavericks and it complained that there was no driver.  Scanning through the list of possible drivers, there were only 1 or 2 Canon drivers and none looked close to right.  Canon's website said the driver should be built into OSX.  Is there an MP160 (or compatible) driver for Mavericks?  <answer272485> I'll try to look for what you need, if you are looking for a driver for the Canon Pixma MP160 printer / scanner to a machine running OSX Mavericks come in here, and if there is no, please see here, hopefully useful  <comment162607> what list did you look at? <comment162618> Did you try to connect wirelessly or through USB? You might need to hard-wire it to the Mac to have the system see the driver is needed through Software Update. See this KB article for more info: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3669 <comment342481> Please add the information in your answer instead of referring to websites that may disappear in the future. <comment342486> It's a bit difficult to attach a driver to an answer :-)
