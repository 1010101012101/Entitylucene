How do I transfer unallocated space from volume A to volume B? <body> Let me just clarify it with the picture below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v1FbP.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, there is much free space on the 'SSDaeffer (1)' partition, but as this was my OS X Beta partition, I want to transfer that free space to the second (SSDaeffer 2) partition and then extend that partition with all the free space. The first partition will be deleted- in the future, just not yet.   How do I transfer that 'free space'. Both are partitions on my SSD.   <comment216373> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17901/how-can-i-resize-a-partition-with-disk-utility
