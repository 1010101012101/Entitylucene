How do I enable CTRL + Scroll zooming? <body> My colleague just did kbdCTRL/kbd + kbdMouse Scroll/kbd scrolling to zoom his screen and is telling me it's a default setting, but it doesn't work for me. Where do I enable that?  <answer40690> That would be under System PrefsTrackpad (or mouse, if you use that instead)Screen Zoom options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EP775.png" alt="System Prefs&gt;Trackpad"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I9sPc.png" alt="Screen zoom options"  <comment46042> I think in Lion it's different, you have to go to accessibility options. <comment46043> What version of OSX are you using? <comment46048> Yep. On Lion, go to System Preferences  Universal Access. In the "Seeing" tab, click the "Options..." button that's in the Zoom section of the window. In the window that appears, select the checkbox at the bottom that says "Use scroll wheel with modifier keys to zoom". <comment46120> @binarybob Thanks!
