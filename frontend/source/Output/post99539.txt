How can I share media from phone to computer via bluetooth: video <body> My home internet connection is limited to 1mbs down which makes it very hard to watch videos on my computer. However my cellular connection is a very respectable 50mbs down, making videos on my phone play seamlessly and instantly.  Is it possible to share videos to my Mac or windows PC from my iPhone via Bluetooth? I know of some options that allow for sharing over WiFi but once connected I lose 49mbs of my download speed making it pointless.
