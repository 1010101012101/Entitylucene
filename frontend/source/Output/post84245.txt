If it didn't appear then try checking carefully between messages and maps, if it's not there then...   Last time I tried to install an application on the App Store, I searched for my app store by swiping down (works for iOS 7.x or 8.x) that's what you do when you have over 200 apps. I noticed that I restricted it for my little sister to use  it.  <answer153089> Try doing these steps.  Open SettingsGeneralScroll down to restrictionsEnter the code when it asks (if you don't know follows instruction #2)Scroll down to FaceTime and make sure the toggle is green.  Now if you don't know the code go to iCloud settings, scroll down to Find My iPhone and disable it by pressing the toggle and entering your password to your iCloud account.  Then backup and restore in iTunes.  <comment96924> There is no Facetime menu in Settings.app? On iPhone it is between Messages and Maps and that should be the same on iPod Touch. Have you looked in Contacts.app to see if there is a "Facetime" option at the bottom of the contact? <comment111297> What do you mean? There is no menu bar in iOS. <comment111298> What version of iOS are you running? <comment111318> @DanielLawson The 5th gen comes with iOS 6 (and all the .x releases have FaceTime included)
