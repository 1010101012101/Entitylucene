Ubuntu on iMac: graphics <body> I have just got a new iMac 14.3 with 21.5″ display. It has Intel i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GT750M graphics card with GPU (Device ID: 0x00fe9). I have installed Ubuntu 13.10 on it (dual boot with refit). Everything works fine apart from graphics. It is clear that graphics' not accelerated. I have tried to…  ol liInstall NVIDIA drivers from the repository./li liDownload NVIDIA drivers and install them manually./li liFollow instructions here./li liFollow instructions here./li liFollow instructions here./li liInstall bumblebee./li liPlay around with xorg.conf file./li liBlacklist nouveau./li /ol  As you may guess, nothing worked. The weirdest thing is, that when I boot from a LiveCD, it picks up screen resolution and all the rest correctly, though when I install the system to my Hard Drive it clearly does not have proper drivers. I have checked it with lsmod and it seems that it pick up nouveau drivers in LiveCD mode — everything works fine then, but it does not in the install mode — get crap resolution. Also, I cannot load nouveau drivers manually. In case this is important, I have to boot with codeacpi=off/code option, as it does not boot otherwise. Does anyone have any suggestion how can I fix this graphics problem?  <answer117453> The solution is actually very simple: just boot with codenolapic/code instead of codeacpi=off/code.
