See full script here    precodedefaults write com.apple.systemuiserver menuExtras -array \   "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Bluetooth.menu" \   "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/AirPort.menu" \   "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Battery.menu" \   "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Clock.menu"  sudo chmod 600 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search  echo "" echo "Disabling OS X Gate Keeper" echo "(You'll be able to install any app you want from here on, not just Mac App Store apps)" sudo spctl --master-disable sudo defaults write /var/db/SystemPolicy-prefs.plist enabled -string no defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false  echo "" echo "Increasing the window resize speed for Cocoa applications" defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001 /code/pre  and facing some problem after that.
