How to have iTerm2 hotkey window slide up and down instead of fading <body> I'm using iTerm2, and my hotkey window used to slide down and then back up. A while ago, the animation changed to having it fade in and out. Is there any way to get it to go back to sliding? I prefer that animation.  <answer181998> Sorry, I had to take that out because it didn't work well on Mac OS 10.10. It is generally unhappy about windows being outside the bounds of the screen and it led to some ugly problems.  <comment216513> Oh. Oh well, thanks.
