How to get to the help input field on OS X in German? <body> There is this nifty little help input field, which I use often as a new Mac user to find the right menu options. It says Command + Shift + ? is the keyboard shortcut to get there, even in the German Apple help pages.  What happens on my German keyboard with German OSX settings is that I already have to press the shift key to get to the question mark. Thus: When I do that, I get the help (Command + ?), not the help input field.  What's the keyboard shortcut to get to the help input field?  <answer232422> By pure chance I found my answer through this post, which is about remapping shortcuts via the settings menu  How do I remove the &#39;Quit&#39; action from an application on OSX  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/80EJu.png" alt="The general settings, which describes the help menu shortcut"  You have to use Cmd + Shift + / to get to the input field! (probably similar for the non German speakers out there)  Sandro  <comment283024> Is this in all apps, or just some? I think that ? is on a shift key in most languages, it's never a single key-press. On a German keyboard it's on shift ÃŸ, English it's shift / <comment283067> @tetsujin  He's talking about the Finder.  The German keyboard brings up a different thing than the US keyboard, even in the OS in English.  Probably a bug. <comment283068> ah, ok @TomGewecke - was just a thought, but my knowledge on non-English keyboards isn't great. Thanks for the correction. <comment283774> I am actually talking about all apps. Do you English keyboard guys end up in the input field when pressing cmd + shift + /     ? <comment284027> Is that the same as Cmd + Shift + 7 on a German keyboard? <comment284451> Yeap, it is indeed
