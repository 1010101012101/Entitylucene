Apple Calendar: Share busy/nonbusy information for several calendars <body> I have a set of calendars, which I would like to share together as busy/nonbusy. That is, I want others to see (on a single calendar) whether I am busy in any calendar at a given date or not.  This does not necessarily have to go through Apple Calendar, but I would like to keep using it. That is, if there's an external software, I hope I don't have to change too much of my current structure.  Nice-to-have: In case I'm busy, people could see which calendar caused that.  /EDIT  Several calendars are google-calanders that I read in, but then there is also some iCloud calendars (Standard iCloud + Facebook)  <answer125477> I recommend you try the Google for that.  The explanations on how to will take to much space in here, but if you follow the instructions here, it is explained nicely.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Movd.png" alt="Google for business"  <comment146849> Tell us the source of the calenders, like are they from Google ? <comment146966> Thanks, but the calendars are not google-only. It probably needs to be some application that uses the Mac Calendars interface. <comment146968> At the time of my answer that information was not available. So you have a mix  of calenders? including some that are "Local" to your mac (not shared) ? <comment146969> Yes. Well, they are not local in the sense as they are synced over iCloud.   For a second, I thought about sharing them with my google account and then proceeding, but that would be suboptimal for several reasons:  i) I'd need to redo the procedure whenever I add a calendar ii) I could easily create a loop, since I am importing my google calendars to iCloud. <comment146971> Got it.. we need to look for different answer than. I do not know how to do what you are asking.
