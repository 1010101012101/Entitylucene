Why is my camera app not working? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Mrs0.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't know why my camera is not working, I am sure it is a software problem, it just shows a black page.   All features are working but it doesn't show anything. It is not working on other apps, like Instagram, as well.br The front camera is not working.br I have tried the "Reset All Settings" option but there is no change and camera is not working yet.    I upload a photo that is a screenshot when I run camera.    How can I solve this problem?  <comment238744> front or rear or both ? <comment238745> @Buscarì›ƒ both not working <comment238759> For drastic measure such as Restore it is highly recommended to back up all your stuff first. <comment238762> Should be covered under warranty too. <comment238763> [Duplicate question.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/198829/120171) same user. <comment238765> @bjbk because I didn't get the answer to solve the problem so I posted it again to see if any other has same experience or idea that can help me <comment238766> You should have updated your original post with additional information, not create a new one. <comment238767> If you edit your original question, with the screenshot for example, it moves up again. This site is different from a forum. But get advice on posting from some of the moderators. Hope you find a solution. Cheers <comment238768> Ops, sorry I didn't know that, will do next time.
