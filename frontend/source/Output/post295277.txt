Traveling to US - Do I need to step up / down for Macbook Pro (2016) <body> I live in the U.K. and I have a Macbook Pro (2016) which I purchased in Dubai. The power adapter works fine in U.K. / Dubai / India.   I am traveling to USA next week.   Do I need to buy the adapter so that it can be used in the 2-pin USA wall sockets or do I also need to buy something in addition to that - say, a step up / step power adapter (My apologies, I am not sure of what it is called exactly... to transform the voltage as well?)  <answer295278> You only need the correct adapter for your power adapter as it will automatically handle the input voltage  Apple has a World Travel Adapter Kit that supplies adapters for different countries/regions.  What you will need is the the US/Japan adapter included in the kit that has "flat parallel blades with holes."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/59BDw.png" alt="enter image description here"
