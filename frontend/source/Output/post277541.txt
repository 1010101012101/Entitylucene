My WD external drive unmounted itself and now does not work <body> I have a strange problem. Working on an OS 10.9.5 MacBook laptop.  Last night, I was exporting a 20-something GB Aperture library from my WD 2TB drive to another hard drive. I left, and when I came back the next morning, my computer warned me that I should properly eject my hard drive. I hadn't disconnected it, and my settings are set so that the computer will NEVER go to sleep or shut down when the power supply was connected (which it was). Now, my mac won't recognize the hard drive.      ul liIs it dead?  /li listrongHow can I prevent this from happening again?/strong/li liHow can I recover my files if I can't see the disk???/li /ul  I've tried:  ol liPowering my computer on and off /li liUsing a different USB connector/li liUsing a different power cord/li liPlugging the external drive into another mac (did not work) /li liPlugging the drive into a windows computer (nope)/li liMounting through disk utility, or using disk utility to repair/verify the disk (got this error message: emDisk utility can't repair this disk.

I also don't know whether to trust my machine to plug another hard drive into it. I can't update to a newer OS just yet. I'm terrified to plug in my other hard drives because what if the same thing happens to them!? Unfortunately all my Aperture libraries are stored on external disks!

If it doesn't work on emdifferent computers/em you have narrowed it down the the WD unit itself.  If the problem was with emyour/em Mac, it wouldn't be present on a different one./li liThe correct response  provided by codediskutil/code for codedisk1/code.  It's highly unlikely (though not impossible), that if the enclosure wasn't functioning you would at least get erroneous information back or no information at all.  The WD enclosure is reporting back that there is a drive but it has no operating system.  Chances are, it's the drive./li /ul  However, you can take it a step further and do some additional diagnostics.  The key here is to isolate the major individual components of the WD enclosure - the logic board and the drive itself.    So, to diagnose this you will need either of the following  ul lia known working hard drive /li lia 3.5" HDD to USB adapter (I recommend this option for reasons that will become clear momentarily)./li /ul  You will need to disassemble the My Book.  From my research, the case appears to be held in place with "snaps" which you just pry off so it shouldn't be too difficult to get into.  There's a straightforward set of instructions on Instructables.com  Depending on the option you took above - you either need to change the drive in the My Book  or plug the old drive into the USB to SATA adapter.  If one component works (i.e the drive), then you know for a fact that the other (i.e. the enclosure) has failed; or vice versa.  If it is your drive, the USB to SATA adapter will allow you to attempt to recover your files.  I have personally used Disk Drill with excellent results (it's free to use the diagnostic portion and to see if you can recover data).  You will be able to make an image of the drive and attempt recovery on the image lessening the chance of total failure of the drive.  If it happens to be the enclosure, the USB to SATA adapter will allow you to continue to use the disk drive while you come up with a more permanent solution (the My Book is essentially the same thing but with a more elegant enclosure).  If you choose the "drive method" you will still be able to get the same diagnostic results, except you won't be able to transfer or rescue any data if it happens to be the My Book enclosure that's bad.  Now, as preventing it from happening again - well, this is a emspinning/em hard drive which means it mechanical.  It's going to fail.  The only thing you can do is strongmitigate data loss by having a backup/strong  <comment349317> When you plug the drive in, can you feel/hear the drive spinning? Does it click, or speed up and then stop, then sped up, then stop again? <comment349337> Yup, it spins and the console says it's trying soooo hard to mount it. Then after a while it just gives up. <comment349338> Thanks so much Allan. I am heading out for the week to do remote field work but will try what you've suggested when I'm back. Nice to have some optimistic thoughts while I am gone. Any idea what would have prompted it to unmount itself in the first place? I've just noticed similar problems with some other drives (which I've been able to fix by moving to a different power source or choosing another cable) so I'm worried my computer is doing something to them... <comment349369> There's nothing that I can think of that would cause a computer (via USB) that would cause a drive to fail.  I would start at the age of the drives themselves.  I just recently had to toss an old USB flash drive because it failed to mount. <comment349593> Just strange behaviour considering it was working fine when I started exporting the Aperture library, then just conked midway through. <comment349609> It's a common perception that because *something* was being done, it must have caused the failure.  You exporting an Aperture volume is nothing more than standard file I/O.  You could have been copying files, deleting files, backing things up, whatever.  It just so happened that the failure occurred at that time.  It's usually one of the two extremes - cases such as yours were you assume routine use cased the failures and then the others where they actively did crazy stuff (like wash the Macbook in water) and believe that action couldn't possibly have damaged it. <comment350341> Thanks, that actually does make me feel better. I should know better (being a scientist). :P I just purchased a new backup drive. Fingers crossed!
