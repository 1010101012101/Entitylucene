How to send ssh command to terminal or iterm2? <body> I must send a SSH script to terminal or to iTerm2. I have try with:  precode/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm '/bin/sh -c "/Users/danilo/bin/scriptSSH 1.1.1.1 22 root password”’ /code/pre  or  precode/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 '/bin/sh -c "/Users/danilo/bin/scriptSSH 1.1.1.1 22 root password”’ /code/pre  or  precode/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 "/Users/danilo/bin/scriptSSH 1.1.1.1 22 root password” /code/pre  N.B.: If I lauch  precode$ /bin/sh -c "/Users/danilo/bin/scriptSSH 1.1.1.1 22 root password” /code/pre  the script works. I must insert it in another SSH script for launch it directly in the terminal.  I have try to lauch different command but it doesn't works. Can you help me? thank you.  <comment329871> Why don't you just execute the script directly (without mentioning iTerm or Terminal)? <comment330175> So what is your applescript code? Have you written any code? Or asking how to do it in applescript?
