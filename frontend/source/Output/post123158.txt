How to take datas from apple time capsule <body> I have an Apple Time Capsule which takes backup of several Mac machines in my company. One of the Macs crashed and have been handed over to a service center.  I need to take the backup data of the crashed machine from Time Capsule. If I try to access Time Capsule from my Mac,it shows only back-up data from my own Mac.   How can I access back-up data from a different Mac?   <answer123225> Try the strongBrowse Other Backup Disks/strong-Option via pressing the strongAlt/strong-Key and clicking the TimeMachine-Icon in the Menubar as stated in the TimeMachine-FAQ.
