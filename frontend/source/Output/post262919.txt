2015 MacBook Air Download Speed Very Slow, Internet Speed is Fine <body> I got a new 2015 MacBook Air from Best Buy on Black Friday (runs on El Capitan).  I set up the laptop and there were no problems - except when I tried to update to macOS Sierra at around 1am last night.    This is when I discovered that the download speeds on my Mac were a mere 0.37Mbps. We pay for at&amp;t U-verse (20Mbps). If it is cable, slower download speeds would make sense, but I'm pretty sure it's DSL - it's just so weird that the speeds fluctuate so wildly.  I ran the internet test on my desktop and download speeds are around 18Mbps. I tried everything, from unplugging and restarting the router, to unplugging the Netgear wifi extender, to turning off all devices connected to the internet except for my Mac.    Someone on the Apple forum suggested that the combination of (command) + (option) + (P) + (R) + (power) was helpful.  I tried that, and the download speed went up to about 6.7Mbps.  When I used Chrome (1-4 tabs open) while macOS was downloading, the projected time went from 2hrs to TWO DAYS. The download speed went back down to 0.37Mbps. Throughout this whole debacle, the upload speeds were pretty much the same (1.41 Mbps), even on the desktop.  I just don't really know what to do anymore, and I have to turn in my final presentation by Monday, which requires Final Cut Pro. Also, I just remembered that I downloaded Chrome and that was completed fairly quickly. HD video on Youtube streams without buffering.
