How do I activate markers and link text in iBooks Author? <body> I want to have text in one place/page, to tap on it and go to another place/page.  I'm new in iBooks Author, I've tried several options and I don't know how it works.  <answer38693> According to documentation:     ul   liSelect the text you want to become a hyperlink./li   liIf the Link inspector isn’t open, click Inspector in the toolbar and click the Link Inspector button./li   liIn the Link inspector, click Hyperlink./li   liSelect “Enable as a hyperlink.”/li   /ul   <answer40881> Its not possible, hopefully Apple will make the App functional in the future. You can only hyperlink to bookmarks within a project and you cant bookmark a page!   <comment43657> Does active mean live in the editor or active mean embedding links for eventual tapping on the iPad?
