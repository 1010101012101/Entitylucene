Using python 3 when the default is python 2.7 <body> I installed python3 with homebrew and can access it with python3 command in terminal.  I'm installing a command line app that needs python3. When I try to use it it says:     Python 3.3+ required   When I do python --version it reports python 2.7.  How can I get the app to use python3?  <answer288473> If there is no other application to use the python2.7, you can use alias codepython/code to codepython3/code:  In the code~/.bashrc/code:  add the codealias python=python3/code  <answer289024> OK, so if you already have python 3.3 or more, then:  ol liOpen the script in an text editor(TextEdit, vim, etc.)/li liReplace all codepython/code with codepython3/code/li liSave and exit/li /ol  ... or just do like @aircraft said, alias it if nothing else uses py2.  <comment364290> you should use `python3 --version`  to check. <comment364294> Yes I know. I'm asking how to get the app to use python3. <comment364295> @Harry Try my edited answer if it works. <comment364297> Does Homebrew install python in a framework?
