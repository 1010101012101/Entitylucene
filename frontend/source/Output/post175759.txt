Problems with Logitech G402 buttons <body> I recently bought Logitech G402 and I've got some problems with its customising. I use OS X.  Apple's mouse can, for instance, swipe between full-screens. I want to bind two side buttons for those gestures.  Also I need this buttons for games. The only thing that I can do is to bind a key from the keyboard in the game and bind the same key for the side button. But I hope, that I can make some kind of "free" button which would be perceived by the game. Like in the image (mouse1, mouse 2).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kSrZ8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment207427> I use [SteerMouse](http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/) to control my 8-button Logitech [$20] but I think you need to explain more carefully just what it is you're trying to do. As it stands your question is quite confusing. <comment207454> @Tetsujin, I want to create a profile with buttons, that will be perceived by the game (like in the image), but won't do anything. If I want to bind a button, the game doesn't "understand" that this button exists. <comment207471> I don't even know what software you're trying to do this with; you didn't say.
