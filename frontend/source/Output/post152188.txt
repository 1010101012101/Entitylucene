Preview hangs when opening any image or pdf <body> Recently Preview has started hanging for me whenever I open any pdf or image. I keep getting the spinning balloon of death and am unable to do anything in Preview, so I have to force-quit the application. Is there something I can do about this?  Crash report is here.  <answer152191> Probably resenting the Preview could solve that problem  Delete following in your code~/Library/code  precodeCaches/com.apple.Preview Containers/com.apple.Preview Preferences/com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList.plist Preferences/com.apple.Preview.SandboxedPersistentURLs.LSSharedFileList.plist Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState /code/pre  Restart preview and test  <answer201760> I had the same issue on OS X 10.10.5, and removing only code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/code was enough to solve.  precodetar czf ~/preview_cache.tgz ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/ # make a backup copy rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/ /code/pre  Then, run Preview again, and if the issue is solved, you can remove the backup:  precoderm ~/preview_cache.tgz /code/pre  <comment179402> You are welcome :)
