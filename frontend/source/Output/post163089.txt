Mac with 2 monitors, how do i switch virtual desktops on one monitor only? <body> I have 2 monitors for mac, one extended the other.  How do i switch virtual desktops on one monitor only?  For example, When I do 4 fingers swipe left/right on screen1,  I expect the switching happens on screen1 only.   BUT both monitors will switch virtual desktops at the same time, how do i avoid that?  <answer163090> I am not on a My Mac at the moment, but in the Mission Control Preferences there is a setting to have the spaces work independently. Go to strongPreferences/strong - strongMission Control/strong - strongDisplays have separate Spaces/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/as6cP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer163173> To add to @markhunte, the switching of desktops seems to depend on where the focus or mouse, is. I have 2 external monitors and 3 spaces on my primary display. When I add a space to an external monitor, the key-combo of kbdControl/kbd + kbd&lt;-/kbd or kbd-/kbd will move the space where the active app or my mouse is located.  <comment190864> What OS X version do You have? If Mavericks or newer go to **Preferences** - **Mission Control** - **Displays have separagte Spaces**. <comment190866> Thanks! it works, it is Mavericks <comment191087> Although this answer was placed here after I put it as an answer it would be helpful for you to accept it so it is listed as solved.
