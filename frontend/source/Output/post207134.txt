iPad 3 with Cellular itself is restarting <body> After the update on iOS 9, iPad 3 with Cellular Model A1430 itself is restarting after 5 minutes. I made hard reset but it didn't help me. I didn't drop my iPad. How can I fix it?  <answer207228> I'd use iTunes to update it to iOS 9.0.1, which just came out today and fixes a lot of problems with the original release.  <comment249979> I am downloading iOS 9.0.1 now <comment250528> I updated my iPad on iOS 9.0.1 and it solved my problem!
