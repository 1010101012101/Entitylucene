Remove Bootcamp when Boot Camp Assist will not <body> I purchased an iMac from a buddy and recently upgraded to Yosemite so I am learning as I go about Macs.  However, I decided I wanted it to be quicker so I purchased an OWC SSD to install as a primary and use the 1TB HDD as a secondary.  Before the install I wanted to remove everything and that included the partition for Boot Camp that shows up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nq8Y1.png" alt="enter image description here"  After reading several tutorials and watching a few videos it suggested going to codeBoot Camp Assistant/code but every time I go I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jfykt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Per this question "Boot Camp Assistant: â€œYour disk could not be restored to a single partition." it says codeClick "Erase" and select "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)"/code but this doesn't do anything in Yosemite.    I've tried downloading the latest to a USB drive but that doesn't do anything either.  So my question is in Yosemite how do I remove the partition from codeMacintosh HD/code completely?

Open Disk Utility  ul liSelect the Bootcamp partition and delete it./li liThen drag the bottom right corner of the Mac partition to expand it back to full size. /li /ul  Read the warnings carefully - Disk Utility will tell you which partitions will be deleted and which will not.  Then quit Disk Utility and set Macintosh HD as the boot volume and restart.  <comment204117> Please open Terminal.app and enter `diskutil list` `diskutil cs list` and `sudo gpt -r -vvv show -l /dev/disk0` and add the outputs to your question. <comment204147> @klanomath I have edited the question per your request. <comment204159> Did bmike's answer work or do you still need help? <comment204161> It worked but by all means if you have a suggestion please add it so it might help someone else. <comment204164> Did you execute `sudo gpt -r -vvv...` before or after applying bmike's solution?
