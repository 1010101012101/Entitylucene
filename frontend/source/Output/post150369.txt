Hotkey to switch button in confirmation window <body> Is there a hotkey to choose another button than the highlighted in a confirmation window, like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ri2Xn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer150371> You need to enable strongFull Keyboard Access/strong in keyboard preferences (Preferences.app). Then You'll be able to switch highlighted buttons by pressing kbdTAB/kbd and press this button with kbdSpace bar/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mY2dg.png" alt="enter image description here"  Image taken from this thread: https://superuser.com/questions/473143/how-to-tab-between-buttons-on-an-mac-os-x-dialog-box   <comment177022> It feels a bit awkward to press space instead of enter, but well, it serves it's purpose. You made my day, thank you very much. :) <comment177023> By default Enter is for "all blue" (default) button :) <comment177954> @Robin That works...except in Chrome.  If I try to download and overwrite an existing file, I get the all-blue "Cancel" instead of the blue-halo button.  Pressing TAB does nothing.  Pressing Ctrl-F7 toggles the setting (can see it in pref panel), but I can't pick "Replace" with keyboard.
