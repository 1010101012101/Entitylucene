OS X productivity application to block access to different websites? <body> I am looking for an OS X application that would strongblock you from accessing certain websites, like social and entertainment one/strong and even hide applications.  The entire purpose is to strongcreate a working environment that allows you to focus on your job/strong.   I have to mention that, the web-browser cannot be banned because it is required to normal use.  Also, the solution I am looking for should provide a way to harden the switching from no-distration mode to unlocked.  This question is about a software solution, so please refrain from recommending books to read regarding productivity.  I realise that using strongParental Control/strong and having a managed account would solve some of these but there are some essential problems:  ul liApplications are not hidden, the system just asks for admin password, yuck./li liYou have to create the list of denied websites yourself, that makes it impossible to manager. Is there a predefined list that we can import?/li liHow to share the documents I'm working on between the two accounts: normal one and restricted one./li /ul  <answer51692> I use Antisocial for this:     Anti-Social is a productivity application for Macs that turns off the social parts of the internet. When Anti-Social is running, you’re locked away from distracting social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter and other sites you specify. With Anti-Social, you’ll be amazed how much you get done when you turn off your friends.   But of course this works only for web sites, not for local applications.
