How to limit kept text messages in iOS? <body> I'm not an iPhone user, but help support them at work.  We have a user who has a large amount of SMS messages for having the same iPhone for quite a few years. He's trying to delete old SMS messages.  On my Android (Galaxy S3), I'm able to set a Text message limit: 200 messages per conversation, so only the most recent 200 messages are kept for each conversation.  Is there something similar for iOS?  <answer145885> Yes, in iOS 8 you can set a limit to the strongtime period/strong of the messages. So, not an actual amount - like the 200 messages on your Android - but you can limit it through Settings  Messages  Keep Messages menu option where you'll see the following flavors:  ul liForever/li li1 Year/li li30 Days/li /ul
