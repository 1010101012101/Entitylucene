What is a camera app for the iPod touch geared towards filming video? <body> I know that there are several camera apps for iOS, but what's a good one for the iPod Touch? More specifically, I'm looking for an app for taking good video.  <answer38627> When I need more control over the video I'm recording I use Canopy Camera Tools. The Canopy app lets you choose a separate focus and exposure point - unlike the stock Camera app. It also lets you lock the white balance once you found a good exposure. Those features are also available when you want to take a picture. You can also make time-lapse video's with Canopy.  I'm sure there are alternatives to Canopy but this is the app I use. There are also apps that - unlike the stock Camera app - let you zoom while you're recording a video but since any zooming is achieved through digital zoom and not optical zoom they will degrade the quality of the video.  <answer38750> Capture is handy. Launching the app starts recording and quitting the app stops recording. Admittedly less useful now that iOS 5 has the camera shortcut on the launch screen, but it's nice for when you want to launch directly into video recording mode.  <comment39878> How would you define "good", especially compared to the builtin Photo/Capture app? <comment39879> I am looking for an app that is geared more towards taking video. More features for taking video...
