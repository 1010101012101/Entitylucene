Adding SMB share to sidebar in OSX Mountain Lion <body> Is there a way to add an SMB share to the sidebar in Finder, such that when I click on the alias, it mounts the share and opens it up like a regular folder? You can do this in Linux and Windows, and if I recall correctly, OSX Lion.  It doesn't work on Mountain Lion (10.8.[0-2]).  <answer76884> It works on 10.8.2 without creating an alias. You can drag the shared folder to the sidebar. It will auto mount after you have disconnected.
