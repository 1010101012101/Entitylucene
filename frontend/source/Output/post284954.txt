OSX Sierra upgrade slows down the Xcode: iOS-simulator to a halt <body> iOS Simulator just hangs on the MacMini.  I have a MacBookPro and MacMini from 2011.  I decided to back up the drives and wipe the main drive on both computers(to speed things up during programming and simulations)... deep clean or reformatting on the MacBookPro hard drive(took 15 hours of doing "7 passes to write zeros"),  MacMini("one time pass" of writing zeros).   I reinstalled the OS on the MacBookPro.  To my surprise, even though the MacBookPro came with OS X 10.6.8 (Mac says you have to upgrade to El Capitan and then upgrade to Sierra)... the install process took me to Sierra directly... no El Capitan upgrade or any upgrade for that matter... just a direct 1st install.  The ios-simulator on Xcode works fine on that computer.    Now the MacMini came with OS X 10.6.3.  On the install it loaded 10.6.3.  Then after something like 5 updates/reboots, I got 10.6.8 updated on it.  I loaded El Capitan on it (after I figured out that the " two-factor authentication" was preventing me from "signing in" to the AppStore to download "El Capitan"... typing the verification codes right after the password.)   I noticed things were much slower... application loading... I assumed indexing would take a couple hours and then speed up... I  installed Sierra anyway.  Oh my...  even slower.  Half a day of nothing didn't help.  I installed Xcode and then ran an App for the Mac... slow but it got there.  Then I tried to run an App on the Simulator.  My pet slug makes better head way.    My hunch is "El Capitan" is the main problem from what I saw with mine and also from what I read.  Sierra works fine on the MacBookPro.   -I disabled SpotLight to only do Applications.. hoping this would help... nothing.   -I highly doubt, but maybe I should do a 15 hour reformatting of the MacMini hard drive or "7 time pass of writing zeros" and re-install everything.  Ideas to speed up things so I can run the iOS Simulator in Xcode on the MacMini running on OS X Sierra?  <comment359348> One of the problems could be ridiculously slow spinning disk HDs. MacTracker has the base Mini 2011 and MBP (13" early '11) with 5400rpm 500GB internal HDs. You may see startling improvement by upgrading to SSDs. Any macOS from Maverick and above kinda requires SSDs. <comment359351> Good to note.  In this case both computers have HDs spinning at 5400.  SSD is something that may help speed things up more even more on the MacBookPro.  The mini, I think is related to OS upgrades as apposed to a clean install. <comment359366> No amount of scrubbing the drive will affect any of the issues you are seeing. You can just as successfully erase a drive by overwriting the first few bytes, the rest is for security not 'cleanliness'. <comment359429> _Both_ machines will benefit from SSDs. We extended the usable lifetimes of 50 MBPs at my job with SSD upgrades alone. 2-3 years longer.
