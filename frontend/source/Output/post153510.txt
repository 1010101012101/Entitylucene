I have a problem resetting my AppleID password <body> I tried to reset my AppleID password but I do not remember the Email account or the security questions I used to create the AppleID. Is there anyway to change or find the email I used for my AppleID?   <answer153517> If the Apple ID is still logged in the iPad, you can view the email address used by the iCloud account in Settings  iCloud. (Email address appears under the name on the iCloud account)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E1SoL.png" alt="iCloud settings pane"  From there, you can retrieve the email address used to register the iCloud account and attempt to recover your password.  <comment180754> the ipad in the moment of active ipad... i cant reach the settings <comment180785> start at https://iforgot.apple.com
