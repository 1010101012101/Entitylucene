Archive Button in Outlook for Mac Not Showing on Ribbon <body> According to the Outlook UserVoice site, the latest version of Outlook for Mac has an Archive feature.  Based on this Microsoft article there supposed to be an Archive button next to the Delete button on the ribbon.  I'm running Microsoft Outlook for Mac Version 15.24 and I'm not seeing the new button. I'm I running the right version? What do I need to do to make the Archive button show?  <answer247580> As it turns out, the Archive button showed up when I added a Google account to Outlook for Mac. It did not show for the existing Exchange account. Guess the archive feature doesn't work with Exchange.
