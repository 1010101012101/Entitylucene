iPhone 5c no longer displays message alerts <body> Suddenly, today my 5c decided it would no longer display message alerts. No sound, no pop up, no vibration just the little red badges over the icon to show theres no messages.  Everything's on in settings.  Would anyone know why this has happened?  <comment323711> 'Little red badges'? Empty ones, without a number... indicates service issues, no phone signal, no voicemail etc. I sometimes see those when I'm out in the countryside, miles from anywhere, or abroad with roaming off. <comment323714> @Tetsujin no there's a number there and I am able to send and receive messages fine. Just can't tell when I receive them <comment323718> @Tetsujin actually, scratch that - now the badges dont even appear!
