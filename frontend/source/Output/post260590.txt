Can I get a SSL certificate for my domain name from Apple <body> I have bought an Apple developer subscription. I've developed a small Safari extension. To publish it in the extension gallery it should be hosted at a web server. I leased a domain name and a virtual private server. Hosted a web server. Apple has given me a certificate to sign the Safari extension. Can I also get a SSL certificate for my domain name from Apple? After all I have an Apple developer subscription.  <answer260591> No, Apple does not issue SSL/TLS certificates for web hosting purposes. Apple's developer certificates are for code signing only.  h1LetsEncrypt and Caddy Server/h1  LetsEncrypt provide free SSL/TLS certificates for use with your web site.  To ease the management your web site, consider Caddy for your web server. Caddy handles the certificate provisioning and renewal for you.  For non-commercial use, StartSSL, also offer free certificates.
