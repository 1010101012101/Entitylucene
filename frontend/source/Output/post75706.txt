iTunes: How to prevent a purchased gigantic app/book from ever downloading? <body> In iTunes, I have purchased some apps and books that are very large in size.  I only purchased them in order to own them, taking advantage of a temporary low price, but I don't plan to use them any time soon.  My internet connection is not very fast and those downloads would take hours.  After purchasing I stopped the download but iTunes will try to download them again when it finds a chance to do so.  I have even deleted the downloads from the downloading list.  But every once in a while iTunes begins to download these gigantic apps/books again.  How can I tell iTunes not to download these purchases EVER unless I explicitly tell otherwise ?  <answer82755> Email iTunes Customer Support - http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact/  Request them to 'clear your iTunes download queue'.  <answer82775> You're better off just letting them download overnight. It'll take a couple of days to get iTunes support to clear the download queue.   <answer82779> Did you check the iTunes Settings (CMD-,)  Store dialog. There are two options at the top:  ul liCheck for new downloads automatically/li liDownload pre-purchased items automatically/li /ul  <answer148289> The solution seem to be to stubbornly cancel the download every time you see it happening. After many times, somewhere in the Big Apple Mother Ship a sentient entity decided to stop trying.  <comment95449> It will keep adding newly purchased items to the downloads queue no matter what settings you have, until they are downloaded.
