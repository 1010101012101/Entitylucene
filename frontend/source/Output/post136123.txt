My Xcode build requires cURL 8.0.0 or later (which doesn't exist) <body> I'm writing a C program in Xcode that uses cURL. It builds properly on my Mac Pro running 10.8.5, but on my MacBook Pro running 10.8.5, it gives me this error when I try to build:  precodedyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/curl/lib/libcurl.4.dylib   Referenced from: /Users/AlecZ/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/UPServer2-folctfcnmdhllzbddscwimqrggig/Build/Products/Debug/UPServer2   Reason: Incompatible library version: UPServer2 requires version 8.0.0 or later, but libcurl.4.dylib provides version 7.0.0 /code/pre  The latest cURL is 7.37.0, so I don't see how it could require 8.0.0. I have run into similar issues before when trying to compile software for Linux from its source, the compiler stating that I need a nonexistent version of some library.  I have already run codebrew install libcurl/code, but it says that I can't replace the system library for cURL.  <answer136124> This is probably not the best solution, but I remembered this just as I was asking the question. After running codebrew install libcurl/code, I moved everything except pkgconfig from code/usr/local/Cellar/curl/7.37.0/lib/code into code/usr/lib/code, replacing old files. So I'm still at version 7.37.0, but it compiles properly now. I don't know what the compiler error was trying to say.  <answer262438> Try reinstalling codecurl/code package, e.g.  precodebrew update brew reinstall curl libcurl /code/pre  This should fix the broken dependencies.  If this won't help, then try to comment out or remove any codeDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH/code, codeDYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH/code or codeDYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH/code references from the startup shell scripts (e.g. code~/.bash_profile/code).  <comment329253> It was a long time ago, but I think I had an unrelated problem. This should work.
