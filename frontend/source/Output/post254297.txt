MacBook Pro 15" Retina Mid 2015 Trackpad Not Clicking <body> The trackpad on my MacBook Pro stopped clicking. I was able to enable the tap to click feature, so I can click around using that, but it's annoying to expect a click and get nothing. It's like the trackpad doesn't depress at all.  I've done some research and some people said it could be a battery issue, with the battery expanding, and other people said maybe it was a software update that could have happened. I haven't done a significant software update in a while, so I don't think that's it.  Any experiences out there with this?  <answer254299> I went in to the Genius Bar and got an answer, so here it is!  strongemNote that this may not work for everyone, but it did work for me./em/strong  ol liThe first thing the tech did was have me save everything and power off the computer. Wait until the screen is completely off and everything is powered down. /li liPlug in your MacBook. /li liPress the following keys in the bottom left of the keyboard: ctrl+option+shift (holding them all at the same time) and then tap the power button key in the very top right./li liIf the light on the charger is amber, it should flash green and then go back to amber. If it was already green, it will stay green./li /ol  This is called an SMC reset, or system management controller.   The way the tech explained it to me, this resets how the computer distributes power, and should make the computer send the correct amount of power back to the trackpad. I don't know if that's exactly how it works, but that's basically how he explained it to me.  After doing this SMC reset, the trackpad started working immediately. Hopefully this works for you as well!  <comment316597> Yes - Your trackpad is malfunctioning.  It could be from the battery swelling or it could be that the trackpad failed.  It's a physical issue so it's going to have to be serviced. <comment316627> See my answer below. I put the question on here so someone else could get the info if needed. <comment374027> Thanks!, It worked good. saved me a trip to the genius bar.
