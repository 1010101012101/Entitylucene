Timemachine works from some stations, but not from others <body> We have 5 Macs in our network (Active Directory)  I have installed a TimeMachine server, and want all mac's to use that as a backup/snapshot disk.  I was able to activate it only on 2 stations, while the rest gives an error that the server is not reachable.  I think it might be a DNS issue, but how do I fix that?  Attached the errors I get from timemachine  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bd1Ga.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5iG6D.png" alt="enter image description here"  Trying Terminal on:      ping optitexnas   ul liis fine./li /ul  Is it another issue?  I tried to connect using AFP to: AFP://optitexnas - Once I did, activating timemachine works, but there are 2 disks, with different names:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UwgpF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I think that the one with the : (timemachine) is wrong.  <comment153473> since you mentioned that it might be a DNS issue - lets investigate that first.  Assuming that the Domain Controller is also the DNS server, open Terminal on your mac and ping the AD server (1) by name then (2) by IP.  If pinging by name fails and by IP works - it yes its a DNS thing  If pinging by name works - we can safely eliminate DNS as a cause. <comment153559> You have a NAS running a software service for TimeMachine. Make sure that the AFP service is on and fully functional on the NAS (check it and check by going in Finder and mounting it using the AFP address). If all Machines can AFP access it that tells us more. If they can't then it could be a permission issue where AD prohibits the mount <comment153908> Thanks 1. using finder made me connect to the NAS. I don't think this is how it should be done, I think it needs to be automatic somehow, but still, feel free to post as answer so I can accept/
