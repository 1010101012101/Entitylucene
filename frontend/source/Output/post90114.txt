Is it possible to a full system Copy and run it in Parallels? <body> i have Mac Server and i want to have a full copy of the System. So i can play around and test new Software and Upgrades before i apply it to the real System. I am using Parallels and want to create a image from the System with the Disk Utility. But i cannot find any Tutorials to do so.  Is it even possible ?  <answer90212> I don't have experience with Parallels, but if you own an external hard disk, you could clone your Mac Server to this hard disk (e.g. with Carbon Copy Cloner or also OS X Disk Utility).  Then boot from the external disk and try whatever you want to try/install - it will not affect your Mac's internal disk. So once you disconnect the external disk and boot from your internal disk again, everything will be as it was before.  <comment105792> Where did you search for tutorials on this already? parallels.com and googling for "cloning OS X for parallels vm" would probably be good places to start. <comment320708> What versions of Server and/or the operating system do you have?  If they are old enough, the answers are very different.
