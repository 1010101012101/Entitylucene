How do you use small caps in Pages? <body> I don't see any obvious options for small caps in Pages, either under styles or text formatting.  Do I need a special font, or does Pages have small caps capability at all?  <answer50366> Maybe this link to the documentation of Pages helps you out?     ol   liChoose Format  Font  Capitalization and choose an option from the submenu./li   liChoose Small Caps to change the text to smaller capitals with larger capitals for uppercase letters/li   /ol   <comment57758> It's also buried on the inspector window - but knowing the menu path is faster in most cases than navigating amongst the tabs of that control element. <comment98906> Note, however, that this fakes small-caps (scaled down versions of the full caps that look rather anemic).  To get proper small-caps, you had to open the Font panel (cmd-t) and then open the Font Panel Actions (small sprocket on the bottom left) and select typography.  This **used** to allow you to use the real small-caps provided with OTF fonts, but it has been broken for about a year now... has Apple abandoned high-quality typography?
