Whatsapp on iOS, how to delete voice messages? <body> Some of my Whatsapp group chats contain about 100mb of voice messages and I want to get rid of them. However, they are not being displayed as "media".  On Android I could just go to the Whatsapp data folder and delete them from there but I can't access that on iOS.   I've also found the whatsapp support being useless, so I am trying here.  <comment349825> Swipe from right to left, select more, delete. Does that work for you?
