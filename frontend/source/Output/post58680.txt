How to get the hand tool back in Preview.app in 10.8? <body> In Mountain Lion's Preview.app the toolbar was changed quite drastically.  While I can see why they did it, I found that it misses the Hand tool that one can use to move enlarged documents around with the mouse.  How to get it back?  <answer59386> You really can’t get it back…  Apple is emphasising the use of gestures for navigation a lot. Them removing the Pan tool is a step in that direction. I miss it too. You can pan around by moving two fingers on your trackpad or mouse.  <answer60126> delWhen opening PDFs in Safari (in embedded mode), the hand tool is still available./del  You could install Acrobat Reader and use this (instead of Preview) for PDF documents.  <answer60636> Here is the trick I use for large images. I select random rectangle than grab it and move selection to where I want my view span to be. Just like old hand mode. Works for me.   <answer121077> You can use the move tool by pressing kbdOption/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd. The cursor will change to the hand that would allow you to scroll the content in all directions.  <comment68419> Hmm, people without a Magic Mouse will love that... <comment68420> And even with a MM the two fingers thing switches Spaces but doesn't pan in Preview :-( <comment68472> You can also pan by scrolling, and scroll horizontally by holding shift. <comment68760> @Lri: While this works, its very inconvenient. <comment68761> Also, gone are all the shortcuts to choose between the hand, rectangle select and text select tools. Instead, Preview.app now tries to be clever and select the "right" tool for you, depending on the file type (images have the rectangle selection Tool activated, while text and PDF have the text selection tool). However, if I open a PDF, to select a rectangle (for example, to crop an area) I need to use the mouse to get to the required tool, which is very inconvenient. <comment69298> I don't see it there either. https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1041539/safari%20embedded%20pdf%20viewer%20tools.png <comment69299> You are right. For whatever reason my Safari opens PDF documents in an embedded Acrobat Reader. <comment69301> Obligatory reference to [leaving Apple feedback about another change for the worse.](http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html) <comment69924> I had that plugin installed a while, I don't like it. Also it doesn't really solve the issue. <comment69927> Interesting workaround, but its not the same. Its more like joystick movement, not direct control of the content. <comment113714> Single finger with MM works for me... I don't mind so much that Apple changed how the feature works as they fact that I had to go searching on the Internet to figure out how to access it. <comment141229> That's it! Quite hidden. Is this documented somewhere? <comment247639> see @user70427's answer: you _can_ get it back, hold down **option** + **space** <comment251154> I'm using this shortcut for Albert... :( <comment300002> If you're using a mouse with a mouse-wheel, you can roll the wheel for vertical scrolling and hold down shift to change it to horizontal scrolling. I like the Opt-Space better, though. What I want to know is how to zoom in/out without using Cmd-+/-. If your hand is on the mouse those buttons are too far apart for single-handed operation.
