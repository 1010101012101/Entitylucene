Iphone 5 can not restore! <body> Hello I have an Iphone 5 GSM it was jailbroken, i tried to do a manual update with the phone itself. Since then the devise is stuck on the apple logo and the loading bar is not moving. I tried to restore it with Itunes but it is not working, it says waiting for the Iphone but Iphone stays on the apple logo. Can anyone please help me?  <answer166338> Have you tried putting your iPhone in recovery mode? http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263 or https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5269891  <comment194948> I did, itunes says extracting, then waiting for the iphone and nothing happens, the phone comes back to recovery mode. and why Itunes is not recognizing the DFU mode?
