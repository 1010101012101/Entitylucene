How to re-backup photos from iPhone to Google Photos <body> Using the Google Photos app on my iPhone I backed up all my photos to the cloud. Unfortunately when I did that, I didn't realize it was uploading using the "High Quality" setting, rather than the "Original" setting. Which means that my photos in the cloud are compressed and cut in size and all that fun stuff.  How can I re-backup the photos using the "Original" setting?
