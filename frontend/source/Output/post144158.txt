Trying to make terminal alias <body> I'm trying to create an alias in my .bash_profile to run an application in the terminal window (Julia programming language), the same way you would run Python from the terminal window by typing "python".  I created a .bash_profile and put  precodealias julia="path" /code/pre  But it says 'No such file or directory', and in fact I tested it out with directories that I know exist, and no matter what I put there, when I type the command in the terminal it still says it.  Can anyone troubleshoot this for me?  Thanks.  <answer144163> To answer your question:  precodealias julia="/Applications/Julia-0.3.0.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia" /code/pre  tested.   (You need to make sure the alias goes inside the OS X app package all the way to binary.)  <comment169840> Need more info. Where is Julia installed? Also, why create an alias rather then just add `julia` to your $PATH. (Also, while this is subjective these days, aliases would more traditionally go in .bashrc. This has no effect on your issue though). <comment169841> @sdmeyers Julia is installed in my Applications folder, how would I add julia to my $PATH? <comment169843> `PATH="${PATH}":/Application/Julia-0.3.0.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/` Assuming the latest binary release. <comment169844> BTW if you generally use `julia` from the command line, I'd suggest installing homebrew (http://brew.sh) and then `brew install julia`. <comment169848> Ok this works (need to change `Application` to `Applications`.  However now when I start up terminal I get a weird tys000 already at the command line. <comment169852> What exactly does the terminal output? Did you do anything else in your .bash_profile ? <comment169853> above path... `Application` s/b `Applications` <comment169857> no just what you wrote in your answer, and it does work, but when I start up terminal I get `MyName-MacBook-Pro-2:~ myname$ tys000`  And I have to hit return to get it to be what it should be which is just `MyName-MacBook-Pro-2:~ myname$` <comment169859> What does your .bash_profile look like? <comment169862> never mind, now it's working, thanks! =). <comment169868> actually sometimes when I open terminal it's fine, and other times it gives me `My-Name-Pro-2:~ myname$ tys000`
