Changing default app to open a certain extension, but keeping the previous icon? <body> I use TextWrangler to open code files, such as code.php, .ccs, .js/code, etc.    But it assigns the same icon to every file. How can I get the original icons back to each extension while TextWrangler is still the default app to open them?  <answer32488> The behavior you want is what happens when strongusing Xcode as the default application/strong.  The behavior you want is not possible with TextWrangler for the following reason:  Textwrangler does not distinguish the icons for code*.php *.ccs.../code like Xcode. Therefore it does not store different icons for different filetypes (codePHP.icns, CCS.icns.../code).   Instead strongTextWrangler only stores one icon for all filetypes/strong: codeTextWranglerTextDoc.icns/code  This icon is located at:  ol liright-click on TextWrangler - show package contents/li linavigate to code.../Contents/Resources/TextWranglerTextDoc.icns/code/li /ol  <comment37225> thanks. So could I manipulate TextWrangler's Info.Plist to accomplish this or is that too far fetched? <comment37226> Yes, I've done it and it works so far: I merged the ``Resources`` folder from ``Xcode.app`` with the one from ``Textwrangler.app``. Then I replaced the entry ``Document Types`` in the ``Info.plist`` for TextWrangler with the ones in Xcode. I hope that's all and safe... <comment41208> This doesn't work for me, sadly.
