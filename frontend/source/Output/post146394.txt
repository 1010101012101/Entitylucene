Safari not showing all Facebook icons <body> sometimes when i login facebook the profile picture icons just won't load. I tried reseting safari, nothing. When i use chrome everything is ok. I googled it and someone said something about deleting a cache file but i could not find in library the safari cache file (i have no idea what it means, i guess some of you will understand). I have the safari Version 7.0.2 (9537.74.9) and OS X 10.9.2. Anyone got an idea of how to fix it? Thank you in advance  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vCenD.png" alt="a random printscreen, some icons load some don&#39;t"  <answer146398> To empty the Safari caches, first you need to have the Develop menu displayed in the menu bar (Preferences | Advanced | Show Develop menu in menu bar). Then on the Develop menu, click on Empty Caches.  You can also use the keyboard shortcut: kbdoption/kbd+kbdcmd/kbd+kbde/kbd.  <comment173611> LOL! Thanks @aris.
