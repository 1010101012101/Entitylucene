How can I simultaneously take pictures from multiple USB webcams? <body> I am looking at using a setup of multiple webcams (5+) to recreate the bullet time effect. However, I have no idea how to simultaneously capture photos from all the webcams hooked up to my computer. How do I do this? I can't have any delay between the pictures; they all have to be taken at the exact same time.  <answer66480> Couldn't you just record videos and synchronize them based on sound or something? You could save frames as images with something like codeffmpeg -i input.mov -r 5 %d.png/code.  <answer66505> I'm not sure this will do everything you need, but SecuritySpy is able to capture video from half a dozen cameras or more simultaneously.  <comment167682> Final Cut Pro?.
