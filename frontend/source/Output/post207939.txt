How to hide a specific active app on OS X (has to be reversible)? <body> Is there a way to hide the application window emand/em the dock icon of one specific strongactive/strong app in OS X? Kinda like a background service that can be turned on or off.  <answer207944> This solution worked for me, but it might depend on the application in question. I tried it with a 3rd party app called "Burn" and it worked.  ol liGo to your applications folder and right click (control-click) on the app you wanna hide from the dock. /li liClick on codeShow contents/code. You should now be able to see "inside" the app's files./li liOpen the codeInfo.plist/code file in the codeContents/code folder with TextEdit (right click - "Open with...")/li liGo to the very bottom of the file and find the last two lines which should say:     code&lt;/dict&gt;/codebr   code&lt;/plist&gt;/code /li liNow insert this before these two lines and save the file.     code&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt;/codebr   code&lt;true/&gt;/code /li /ol  After this the app's dock icon will not be shown anymore. Keep in mind that you will need to use the Activity Monitor or Terminal (codekillall &lt;appname&gt;/code) to quit the app if you close the window.  If closing the window quits the app, you can press codecmd + h/code to hide the window. This should make your app completely invisible.  To make it visible again, just remove those two lines again and the app should behave like before.  hr  Source: Link  <answer295260> A 3rd party strongdrag-and-drop/strong application called strongDock Dodger/strong removes an Application from the Dock and codecommand + tab/code sequence for you. This way an application is still strongactively running/strong but completely stronghidden/strong.  It works for most applications on Mac.
