Mail spelling checker will not stop <body> This is driving me crazy.  I have gone into Preferences and set spellchecking - NEVER  But it will not stop!    :br   :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TQItz.png" alt="enter image description here"  This gets my goat. I rarely if ever make spelling errors, and it is constantly getting in my way.  Is there some way to get rid of it once and for all?  EDIT: I use Mavericks' native speech recognition; maybe there're some conflict?  <answer119480> They blue lines are alternate speech recognition hints. Spelling is in red, not dark blue.  I don't know of a way to disable the blue lines directly other than enunciating in a way that the engine has less uncertainty about what you are dictating.
