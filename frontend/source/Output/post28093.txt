How do I make sure a download is paused even though the network is not available? <body> Say for instance I have 10 downloads (podcasts) queued in iTunes. I click "pause all" of them and shutdown the computer.  Now I move to a place where internet is not available. It still tries to download the files but they are skipped and the entry is removed from the download list.  The problem is that the download list gets cleared when I'm not on a network.  It would have been ok if the download tried and failed (with the download still on the list), but the downloads disappear.  How can I fix this?
