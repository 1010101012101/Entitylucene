Connect iPhone to USB HardDrive <body> I have a unique situation at my company.  We are trying to develop a mobile service app that connects to slot machines.  If you connect a PC to the slot machine, an external HD pops up in Windows and you can copy files to it.  We want to do the same thing through an iPad.  I know this would be all custom code, but I was wondering if it was possible for iOS to read an external USB drive through it's doc connector.  <answer29568> No. iOS/iPad is only able to act as a USB host with the Camera Connection Kit (Apple Store). Even then, it only works to import/export pictures and videos between the iPad and camera.  <answer29571> It may be overkill in your situation, but take a look at the Apple's APIs for programming External Accessories (ADC link). It may require changes to the hardware, but may serve your needs for use with future devices.  <comment33937> Yah, We will be writing a custom app for sure, you think you'd be able to code something with file access. <comment33939> So no possibility of custom code against a hardware device?  Or are you commenting that it's not possible out of the box? <comment33940> File access is generally a no-no on iOS device. That's part of the tradeoff for iOS stability. But maybe you can get around it a bit with the accessory stuff. <comment33956> Not file access on the device.  File access through the USB cable to an external device.
