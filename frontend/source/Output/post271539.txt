Mac OS Sierra : Changing frequency at which trash is emptied <body> I stumbled upon a post explaining how to auto delete files that are in the trash after 30 days (finder preferences  advanced  'Remove items from the trash after 30 days').  I am willing to change this setting to 7 days. Does anyone know a command line or something else to change that value ?  <comment352836> I've been looking for the same but can't work out how to do it. The function to enable this is in the Finder's plist file, but not the setting that controls duration. I'd also be interested in setting this to a lower value.
