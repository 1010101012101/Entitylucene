Mavericks Notes not compatible with IOS 10 Notes? <body> 2010 MacBook Pro on Mavericks, Notes are not syncing with Notes on iPhone 5s on ios10. Is there a compatibility problem? I have tried all the usual remedies without success.   <answer257502> Yes, there's a compatibility problem. Notes were upgraded in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan, and you can't sync between OS versions from before and after the upgrade. You'll need to upgrade your Mac to El Capitan or Sierra (which you should do anyway, since Mavericks will soon stop getting security fixes, if it hasn't already).  As a workaround, you can use a web browser to access notes in the cloud via web app. Itâ€™s not as convenient as the native app, but you can get at the notes from https://icloud.com  <comment321817> That is as I suspected Mike. I have stuck with Mavericks because I need to run XP on Parallels and I understand later OS won't do that. ALL my accounts are on the wonderful "pre-millenial" Quicken, which is why I need XP, and I haven't ever found anything anywhere nearly as good to replace it. <comment321870> I think your understanding is wrong, I ran an XP virtual machine in Parallels on Yosemite. I think you may be thinking of Apple dropping Boot Camp support for XP, which is not related to Parallels VM support for it.
