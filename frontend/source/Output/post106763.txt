How to type telnet escape character in OS X terminal <body> precodeEscape character is '^]'. /code/pre  How does one type that? On Finnish/Swedish keyboard  kbdAlt-9/kbd is code]/code, but kbdCtrl-Alt-9/kbd gives just code9/code.  (For non-scandinavians, code[]/code and code{}/code are Alt-8/9 and Shift-Alt-8/9 respectively in SE/FI keyboard)  <answer106769> You can run codetelnet/code with a different escape char using codetelnet -e/code.  For instance, to use KBDcontrol A/KBD, type codetelnet -e ^A/code.  You may also create a file code~/.telnetrc/code with this contents:  precodeDEFAULT    set escape ^A /code/pre  In both cases code^A/code is code^/code followed by codeA/code, not KBDcontrol A/KBD typed directly.  <answer106924> I enabled the Finnish and Swedish keyboard layouts and experimented with emTerminal/em on OS X 10.8.5 a bit…  ul likbdControl/kbd-kbdå/kbd generated code^]/code (U+001D)br kbdå/kbd (LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE) is an unmodified key in these layouts.br It is located where kbd[/kbd (LEFT SQUARE BRACKET) is with US layouts./li likbdControl/kbd-kbdä/kbd generated code^[/code (U+001B)br kbdä/kbd (LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS) is an unmodified key in these layouts.br It is located where kbd'/kbd (APOSTROPHE) is with US layouts./li likbdControl/kbd-kbd-/kbd generated code^_/code (U+001F)br kbd-/kbd (HYPEN-MINUS) is an unmodified key in these layouts.br It is located where kbd//kbd (SOLIDUS, a.k.a. “forward slash”) is with US layouts./li /ul  As normal, kbdControl/kbd-kbdSpace/kbd generated code^@/code (U+0000) and kbdDelete/kbd generated code^?/code (U+007F).  I did not find any combination that generated code^\/code (U+001C) or code^^/code (U+001E) in emTerminal/em though. There may be other combinations that work in other terminal emulators though (e.g. emiTerm/em 2 in its default configuration arranges for kbdControl/kbd with kbd2/kbd–kbd8/kbd generate the “non-alphabetic” control characters; this is similar to how emxterm/em works).  <answer167743> Just type 'quit' then press 'Return' button.  <comment125299> Any idea what those proper settings might be? (`No manual entry for telnetrc`) <comment125301> `man telnet` says that it's the same as when using `telnet` in interactive mode: `set escape ^A`. <comment125306> does not work for me... <comment125314> See my edited answer. <comment125714> Ctrl-å does the trick, thanks!
