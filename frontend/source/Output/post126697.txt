Do iCloud email addresses ignore periods like Gmail? <body> In a Gmail email, you can put periods in your email, but in the end, the address is seen without them.br So dave.tess@gmail.com is also seen as davetess@gmail.com or even d.a.v.e.tess@gmail.com.    My question is, does iCloud handle emails this way too? If I have an address with periods in it, could I send an email to the same address without periods and receive it?   <answer126699> No, this doesn't work for iCloud email addresses. Just tried it and the email failed to deliver â€” the email must be exactly correct.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIbvl.jpg" width="320"  <answer229270> Technically this depends.  If the address was set up under the me.com days and you already created an alias with the dot then it will work. Otherwise, it will not.  I have an address previously set up with an alias (during iCloud's me.com days) and mail will be received at the "dotted" address. I think currently iCloud does not allow additional aliases if you were not grandfathered under me.com.  <comment148410> Why not try it? ;) <comment148411> Because part of the nice thing of these forums is that when people google these questions they are brought here for answers. I'm probably not going to be the only person with this question. <comment261467> superset: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14865869/do-all-email-providers-ignore-periods-in-front-of <comment300553> Interestingly, I didn't get a permanent failure message from the mail daemon for my no dot test even though it never arrives: myname@icloud.com (never arrives), m.y.n.a.m.e@icloud.com (failure notification), my.name@icloud.com (valid, arrives).
