Download MacOS install disc? <body> My MacBook Pro doesn't boot anymore. I've lost my install disc for the OS and I need to format/re-install. What are my options?  <answer14591> Go to an Apple store or Apple reseller and purchase the Snow Leopard install DVD.  It's relatively inexpensive (as far as Operating System prices are concerned).  Here is the link to the online store, where it will ship within 24 hours.  <comment15724> Many apple stores are set up for a rapid net install restore that takes 5 to 25 minutes based on load and your mac's speed. Also, ordering replacement media may be less expensive than the retail DVD. <comment15726> very true.  In my case, I'd be so desperate to get going again, I'd be busting down the doors of my Apple store than waiting for a shipment :)
