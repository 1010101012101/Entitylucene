Ext2 utility "e2cp" alternative for OS X <body> In my linux machines, I use the command line utility e2cp to copy files from and to ext2 disk images. Unfortunately, OS X does not provide any ext2fs utility out of the box. Is there a version of e2cp that is compatible to OS X, or a similar alternative? Notice that I don't need to mount or do anything advanced, I just have to copy files.  <answer208052> To the best of my knowledge, you've got two options to mount ext2/3 filesystems in OS X:  ol lifuse-ext2 plugin for Fuse for OS X: open-source projects that appear to be fairly active./li liExtFS for Mac OS X by Paragon: Currently $20 with a free 10 day trial; their page is a little confusing referencing "ExtFS for MacÂ® 9", which appears to be the version 9 iteration of their product, not Mac OS 9. /li /ol  <comment250982> I don't actually need to mount filesystems, I need a command line replacement of e2cp to copy files from and to a disk image, because it is part of my automated build process. <comment250984> Let's break this down a bit - what format are your disk images? Are they just whole ext2 disks `dd`ed into a single file?
