Bootcamp cannot find both systems at startup <body> Something strange happened:   ol liI closed my macbook pro while using windows 10/li liWhen I opened it again it didn't wake up for a while so I forced it to shut down by pressing the power button for 10 seconds/li liWhen I restarted the computer, it could not find any OS and just displayed a flashing question mark. I tried starting the computer while pressing the usual special keys, but nothing worked./li liI gave up and went for 2 days of vacations, instead of being angry./li liI just came back from vacations (after two days) and everything works fine. /li /ol  strongUpdate/strong  Today nothing works, it is impossible to find the SSD, even when I try OS X Recovery over the Internet Disk  Utility does not find the SSD (just a drive of about 1.28 Go where the OS X recovery is installed). I tried reseting the NVRAM and the SMC without any luck.  Is it necessarily a disk failure?  strongUpdate 2/strong  It's not a disk failure since I installed my SSD into a friend's Macbook Pro (same model: retina 15" late 2013, 2.3Ghz) and it works properly. I also tried to insert his SSD into my Macbook Pro and it is not recognized.  I returned my computer to an Apple reseller...  <answer236485> emAuthor of the question answering:/em  It's not necessarily a disk failure since I installed my SSD into a friend's Macbook Pro (same model: retina 15" late 2013, 2.3Ghz) and it works properly.

I don't know where it comes from though...  <comment288813> Did you try to boot into Recovery or Single User mode? <comment288826> Yes it didn't help. I think my question is clear enough now. <comment288827> Diagnosing potential hardware issues is always difficult without physical access to the machine, so it helps to be very specific. In step 3, what actually was displayed, a flashing question mark as shown in the picture behind the link? Which "special keys" did you try? Also, what does "nothing works" mean now? Same problem as in step 3? <comment288828> The only way to find out whether this is a disk failure is to run the tests recommended in the answers to the question you've already linked to. <comment288990> Yes it is the question mark flashing, of course. I obviously tried all [appropriate special keys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255). Now the disk is not recognized at all anymore so I can't run the tests.
