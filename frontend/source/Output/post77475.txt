What's the difference between device file and its raw version? <body> It's convenient to use codedd/code to write image file to USB sticks. But I find sometimes people write codedd of=/dev/disk1/code and there is alos codedd of=/dev/rdisk1/code.   e.g.   ul liThe arch wiki/li /ul  code  dd if=image.iso of=/dev/disk1 bs=8192 /code  ul liThe Raspberry Pi instruction/li /ul  code sudo dd bs=1m if=~/Downloads/2012-10-28-wheezy-raspbian/2012-10-28-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/rdisk3 /code  What is the difference?  <answer77484> On OS X, the coder/code means raw device (same as on other UNIX) and on OS X the raw file is a character based I/O and the normal diskX... is a block special device.  Both of these entry points allow a program to access a bare stream of information on the drive without interacting with the filesystem (file names, paths, etc..) and the character device bypasses any buffers (that both speed up access and slow it down depending if you are making large or small operations).  Wiki has a nice article on these general concepts: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file  <comment89993> nice explanation
