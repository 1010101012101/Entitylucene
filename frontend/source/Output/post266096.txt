How can I get OS X 10.12.1 to stop asking me to complete iCloud configuration? <body> I have a new MacBook Pro 15" with OS X 10.12.1.  Just about every day for the last two weeks I get a small (annoying) reminder in the upper right corner of the screen to complete configuration of iCloud.  I have declined every request to configure iCloud. I have also disabled all types of iCloud information including "find my Mac" in the System Preferences under the Apple menu.  strongSo, click System Preferences then iCloud and this is what you see.../strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBVTu.png" alt="When I choose iCloud in System Preferences it looks like this"  I absolutely do not want iCloud, ever. I would like to make the reminder stop popping up.  I have searched google and SE and have found variations on this question for other software (iTunes), but nothing about my specific situation.  A command line solution is fine. I'm willing to delete or rename programs and otherwise wreck stuff that Apple wants on my machine that is no use to me. I don't want apple mail, contacts, calendar, media, any of that stuff. iTunes is, for me, only a tool for managing iOS devices. This is only a software development box.  Any clues would be appreciated.  <comment334246> I found a clue. I looked around a bit when this reminder window popped up today. I found that by using launchctl to unload notification center this reminder went away. Now the test will be whether I can keep it gone by keeping notification center turned off. And the next question will be whether I can disable just this item and not the entire notification center.
