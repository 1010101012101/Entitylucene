MacBook Pro 13 Inch Keyboard and Trackpad freezes randomly <body> I just bought a MacBook Pro 13" and I am running the Mac OS X El Capitan and everything was working just fine until recently that I am facing this very weird issue of my keyboard and trackpad freezing randomly. When the trackpad freezes, the keyboard freezes at the same time.  I have searched online and seen many work arounds that didn't work like;  ul liClosing the display of the computer for approximately 1 min then opening it./li liRunning hardware tests, checking for incompatible Mac extensions etc.../li /ul  Yesterday I had a kernel panic and I am sure its because of this issue. Please if there is a way of stopping this weird condition, I will really appreciate because non of the solutions that I found online worked for me.  <comment313556> If you just bought it then why not go into an Apple Store and use your warranty?
