Opening suspicious files <body> How can I deal/inspect a suspicious file on my mac short of installing and creating a full blown virtual machine instance? On windows when I want to open a suspicious file I use the sandboxing app sandboxie Is there something comparable/safe on mac?  <answer190554> Open up the terminal and try:   precodezipinfo zipFileOfInterest.zip /code/pre  If you really want some "verbose" information output, then enter:  precodezipinfo -v zipFileOfInterest.zip /code/pre  The "-v" option will output a bit more information :)  Also, try codeman zipinfo/code to get the rundown of what options/etc is available.  You can also try:  precodeunzip -l zipFileOfInterest.zip /code/pre  These will allow you to peak inside the .zip without extracting what is inside.  <comment226190> what is a suspicious file? <comment226206> In my case, a zip file containing several files, one of which is a .app file. <comment226210> You can explore the app contents without executing it bay right clicking on it and selecting "Show package contents". <comment226259> @user79950 Try my suggestions. Just open up terminal and enter the commands.
