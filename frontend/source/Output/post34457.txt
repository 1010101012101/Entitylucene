Is there a way to show a badge icon for Reminders app on iPhone? <body> Maybe it is possible but I'm doing something wrong.   I want to know the total number of reminders for the day by just glancing at the icon. Do you have any suggestion?  <answer36516> There doesn't seem to be a way to do it no, not using the Apple app anyway.  Let them know you want it: http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html  <answer62851> According to this post at Cult of Mac, that functionality will be coming with iOS 6, which will be shipping this fall.  <answer66376> Badges now show for reminders as of iOS 6, released September 2012.  <comment39364> Apple decided not to show one so there isn't. <comment39365> maybe there is jailbreak tweak that enables it, or at least shows them on notification panel?? <comment62941> I know that this question is a bit old, but to answer your question, there is on, er, that version of iOS that is currently under NDA. See [here](http://www.cultofmac.com/173126/new-in-ios-6-more-emoji-icons-banners-for-new-apps-badges-for-reminders-app/) for more info. <comment62954> @gtm Ehh... It's ancient question lol:))
