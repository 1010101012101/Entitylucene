A way to add keypress to bring up login window <body> Is there a way to config the login window to require a (possibly hidden) set of key press before letting you to login?  In windows that is the control alt delete dealie, but that is shown on the screen, would be nice if it could be hidden.  So when you wakes the system all it would show is maybe some background wall paper and not even show the user acct or password fields. Until that specific combos of keys are pressed.
