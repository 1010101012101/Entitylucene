OS X does not recognize keyboard and trackpad while Boot Camp Windows still can <body> I've encountered strange issues on my Macbook Air 2013.  ol liI spilled some drop of water on keyboard (near trackpad and spacebar)/li liI did some cleaning, and then try to boot again./li liThe OS X then can not detect my keyboard and trackpad. I was unable to log in./li liBut still I'm able to press button to reset PRAM and SMC, but nothing changes./li liI decided to wait, after a few hours, I booted it again and this time the Fan start to run at (seem to be) max speed without any heavy task (I wasn't able to log in)./li liI tried to boot Windows 8 on the Boot Camp partition, surprisingly it works, trackpad and keyboard are fine. I'm writing this from windows./li liSo I thought maybe I should re-install OS X like someone said on this forum. but the installation also denied to recognize the keyboard, so I stop installing./li /ol  Could you help me to make the OS X recognize my keyboard, trackpad and stop my fan from sounding like a helicopter?  Edit: I ran an AHT and it told me I have SMC error code PFM006, which I heard to be related to thermal sensor. I'll probably bring to a store to fix...   <answer143607> Dry it out for a few hours in a warm place and see what happens :)  <answer143613> You could try the SMC reset. Option-Command (⌘)-P-R   http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14222  Also try start in safe mode, that does some repairs. (hold Shift)  Try using external keyboard.  Finlay use the OSX restore function to restore your OSX.  (Command(⌘)-R)  Maybe lesson learned and buy a cheep keyboard cover in the future.  <comment169293> thanks. I tried SMC reset and safe mode but nothing changed. External keyboard works but the fan still goes crazy. I actually have a cover but the keyboard is too good to be covered :)
