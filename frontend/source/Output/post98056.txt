Where are Profile Manager Configuration Profiles Stored on OS X? <body> I ask because I configured and installed a profile for a network account on my Macbook Air (10.9) to create a synchronized Mobility Home on a Mac Mini server (10.8).  However, I cannot login as this user on the server or my Air, because I receive the message that the home already exists. This occurs even though I have removed the devices from profile manager and the user from the group.  I expect this is because I have not updated the configuration profile on the account, but I cannot do so because I cannot log in as that user.  So, I'd like to purge any instance of these configurations. So far, I've tried the following:  ol liDeleting code/Library/Preferences/DirectoryService//code/li liClearing the MCX Cache as per this Apple KB article/li /ol  I am asking specifically how to clear these configs, but if it comes up, yes, I have deleted the home folder on the Air and the Mini, and no, neither have a local account with the same name.  <answer98088> If you haven't restricted System Preferences in the Profile Manager it should be an option in System Preferences  Profile.   Delete it from there and reboot.   <answer98189> The profiles appear to be stored in  precode/private/var/db/ConfigurationProfiles/Store/ConfigProfiles.binary /code/pre  I'd not recommend tampering with it, though.  To see what profiles are installed, and then remove one, assuming you can sudo to the user, you could try:  precoderoot$ sudo -u chymb profiles -L chymb[1] attribute: profileIdentifier: com.stackexchange.apple.test There are 1 user configuration profiles installed for 'chymb' root$ sudo -u chymb profiles -R -p com.stackexchange.apple.test /code/pre  <comment115123> I could not login as the user, so the profile did not appear there. <comment115201> Sorry, missed that. <comment115202> Is it other users or one specific one? Can you delete and recreate the user? <comment115287> The user did not show up in the user list in System Preferences or dscl, so I couldn't recreate it. <comment115288> I ended up resolving it a different way (by fixing the problem that prevented the mobility home from being created), but this answers the question and is what I was looking for. Thanks!
