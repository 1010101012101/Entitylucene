Accessing Time Machine for different computer <body> My hard drive died on Computer 1.  Backed up to Time Machine.  Am now using Computer 2. I need some files from the desktop of Computer 1.  Can I access them on Time Machine? How?br I have three computers all backing up to that time machine, but all I can see is the backups for Computer 2.  How do I find Computer 1?  <answer139236> If you press the kbdoption/kbd key when clicking the time machine icon in the menu bar, you can browse backups from other computers.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3roO4.png" alt="enter image description here"
