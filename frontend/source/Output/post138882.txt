Manage disk space with Final Cut X <body> My hard drive is full and I have a finished project on it that may require some small modification.  What is the good way to manage Final Cut X data? I have a 50Gb Final Cut file in my Video folder and don't know how to process...  <answer138898> The Final Cut Library Manager is a wonderful app that lets you selectively remove optimised and proxy media as well as render files, freeing space. These can be recreated if necessary from the original media and timeline.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6LPB2.png" alt=""   The original media is still required if you wish to edit the footage in the future.  <comment163963> This look promising! But do I have to move my local library to my NAS with the finder?
