Why does Mac open picture clipping in Finder instead of Preview? Why aren't other images opened in Finder? <body> I have a "Picture Clipping" file on my desktop. It has a preview of the image that I assume it has in it. When I double click on it, a window pops up. I assumed this was the standard "Preview" program that Mac seems to use for opening images. But no! It's the "Finder" program. And, of course, I can't quit Finder. In this non-preview view of the image, it says at the bottom "Clipping contents: TIFF image".  This finder window does not seem to act as a normal Finder window. That is, it's not a folder window. So... what is it? And why is Mac using "Finder" to show an image instead of Preview? Why isn't Finder used to show other images?  Can anyone explain the suggested workflow with dealing with these?   OS X El Capitan 10.11.6  <comment311725> Aren't there also text clippings?  Or have they gone away in newer OS versions? <comment311731> I've not used clippings in a long time, but are you sure it's not Quick Look? Tapping Space Bar would close it, if so. <comment311732> Clippings (of any kind) are a very special file format in OS X and can only be opened by Finder. <comment311771> The suggested workflow would depend on what you're trying to do. There's a question on [Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/176116/converting-mac-os-xs-picture-clipping-files-to-image-files) that addresses how to convert them to image files (because clippings are not), though it's six years old.
