What happens when I select "new station from song" in iTunes 12.2? <body> When I click "new station from song" in iTunes 12.2 the currently playing song stops playing and as far as I can tell nothing else happens. Does a station get created somewhere? I can't find any radio stations except for the official Apple ones in the tab "Radio". I am subscribed to Apple Music and signed into my iTunes account.  <answer196182> Seems like this is a bug in iTunes, happens to me as well as others. There's a few posts on the apple support forum:  ul lihttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7106282/li lihttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7115175/li lihttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7112080/li /ul  There's more if you search there, but no solutions available.  h1UPDATE:/h1  Bug is fixed for me in iTunes 12.2.2.25
