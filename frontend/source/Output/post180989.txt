Time Machine: Include files and folders from another drive <body> Is there a way to stronginclude/strong folders and files to a Time Machine backup, say, because they are on another drive?  I am using Yosemite version 10.10.2.  <answer180991> If you set up Time Machine the first time, it automatically excludes any external drives including the Time Machine drive itself.  If you want to have certain drives included, just remove them from the exclusion list inside codeSystem Preferences &gt; Time Machine &gt; Options/code and they are backed up the next time Time Machine runs.
