I'm getting FaceTime calls from an Email I do not recognize <body> So, you see I am getting FaceTime calls from an email I do not recognize, though they have the same last name as my best friend. I asked her and she said she had no clue who it was. The first time they called, I ignored them, they called a few minutes ago and I answered them, thinking they were my best friend. The room had peachy walls and a black tv box thing with a red light on the front. They were on the call for a few seconds and hung up. They never spoke. I do not recognize that room, or the email. We think it is her brother messing with me but I am not too sure. I have seen his room and I do not recognize the corner I saw. Next time they call should I answer? Is this serious or just me being silly when this is probably just a prank?
