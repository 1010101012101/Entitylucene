Click on the Log in items and disable anything using the (-) sign to remove.  Restart your system. If the MPlayer is still running STOP it. To do that press 3 keys all together [alt (option)+ cmd +esc]. A new widow will show where you can select the MPlayer and force quit it.  strongFinally lets repair your User profile./strong  Hold cmd+r during restarting of the computer  You will boot into the Repair Utilities screen.   On top, in the Menu Bar click the Utilities item then select Terminal.  New window - type coderesetpassword/code  You will not reset the password but:  Instead, click on the icon for your Mac’s hard drive at the top. From the drop-down below it, select the user account where you are having issues.  precodeAt the bottom of the window, you’ll see an area labeled ‘Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs’. Click the Reset button there. /code/pre  The reset process takes a couple of minutes. When it’s done, quit the programs you’ve opened and restart your Mac.   If none of the above worked I am afraid you will need to restore your Mavericks first before Installing Yosemite. To that use the cmd+r again and follow the instructions how to restore. Normally you data will not be touched during this process, but if you have back up it is better.  <comment224686> os x the version? 10.9.5 and the model is macbook pro - i hope u mean that- <comment224693> your user profile is messed up. Get his non intrusive app and check your system.  http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck <comment224695> i downloaded it, the result has some red colour, is that where the problem came? <comment224697> the red ones ? 1-      Macintosh HD (disk0s2) /  [Startup]: 120.47 GB (14.70 GB free) (Low!) 2- Time Machine not configured! 3- 100%    MPlayerX <comment224698> The whole report please (all of it) <comment224701> i can't, the litters aren't enough :( <comment224702> Copy paste in your original post not in the comments field. <comment224703> oh sorry, i did it now, please check it. i hope it'll be solved T^T <comment224704> i removed the 4, and restart the mac, but the same empty pop-up :( <comment224705> i restarted the mac to make sure, non of apps start when i restart. and i tried, but the empty pop-up .... :( <comment224728> I had that once but not when updating/installing but doing something else that needed the admin password (can't remember what it was). It was confusing! Somehow it did it not again after a restart or maybe I did repair permissions with Disk Utility first. So I would first repair the boot disk's permissions and restart after that and see if it still happens. <comment224729> Do you have the same blank dialog when trying to unlock System Preferences, say, in the Security pane which has a button to unlock it? <comment224747> Did you try just entering your admin short-name & password?
