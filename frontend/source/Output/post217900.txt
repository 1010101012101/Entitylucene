Convert PDF images to PNG using Automator <body> I want to convert a bunch of PDF images to PNG images. How do I tell Automator to resize the final images to a specified size (in pixels) like code100x100/code?  Automator is also adding a number to the end of each file which increments each time I run the workflow.  ol liGet Specified Finder Items/li liRender PDF Pages as Images/li liCopy Finder Items/li /ol  <answer217947> I added the 4th part from Photos 'Scale Images' which did the job for me...  ol liGet Specified Finder Items/li liRender PDF Pages as Images/li liCopy Finder Items/li liScale Images/li /ol  Best, Peter
