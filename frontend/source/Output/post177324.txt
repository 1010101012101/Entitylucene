Cannot enable Java in Safari <body> I have the following running on my Mac:  ul liOSX Yosemite (10.10.2)/li liJava version 8 update 31/li liSafari 8.0.4/li /ul  I am unable to run any Java applet on Safari. I have added multiple sites to the exception lists (in System Preferences - Java Control Panel - Security), but it has not changed anything.  I also don't see anything related to Java in Safari preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/beaI8.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I try to run a Java applet, it says, codeError. Click for details./code, and when I do, this is what I get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kzlw3.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried Chrome and Firefox as well, and this is the common error they give me:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YrGLf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Whatever I do, I cannot allow for Java applets to be run on any browser.  <comment213759> Have you put http://140.113.239.214 on the Exception Site List <comment213933> I did, it didn't work. But, I think there is something wrong with the application. It worked for another site. Thanks.
