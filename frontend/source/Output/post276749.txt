Can I restart macOS Sierra in safe mode remotely? <body> I want to restart a MacMini with macOS Sierra in safe mode, but I have only remote access.  You can do this with this:  precodesudo nvram boot-args="-x" /code/pre  (source: https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262).  But for macOS Sierra, you have to start in RecoveryMode to be able to do this.  Is there a way to do this remotely?  <comment348384> That's weird, it works for me on Sierra. Do you have anymore info about the Mac you can provide us?
