How to transfer screenshots from iPhone to OS X? <body> I dont' want it done automatically, I just want to get a bunch of screenshots from the phone to the Mac (OS X El Capitan). I plug in the phone but only iTunes starts up and I can't find any photos in it.  <answer243131> Select picture on iPhone - Export icon (box with arrow pointing out) - Scroll through options where to send (ex. email or google drive)  <answer243138> I usually get it accomplished by using AirDrop between my iPhone and my Mac Mini by selecting either a single photo of a variety of photos or even an event of photos and selecting the Share button  <answer243145> ol liConnect your iPhone to your Mac via with the lightning cable/li liOpen emImage Capture/em app/li liSelect your iPhone under on the left sidebar/li /ol  You can now select all the screenshots taken on your iPhone and import to your Mac.  <comment299316> There's like 20 screenshots, and when I click the icon my Mac isn't on the list. I just wanted to copy the files. <comment299318> Yep.. There are limits when selecting so many.  If your Mac is newer, you can Airdrop--super cool but only on latest Macs
