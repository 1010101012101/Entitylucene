How do I type a tilde in spanish keyboard? <body> It is difficult work with the Terminal if you can't type the tilde. Does anybody know how to do this using a Spanish keyboard?  <answer219606> Using a Spanish keyboard and Spanish keybindings the tilde is kbdalt/kbdkbd√±/kbd. Using English keybindings (System Preferences - Keyboard - Input Sources) and a Spanish keyboard it's still kbdalt/kbdkbdn/kbd. If you immediately enter a kbd//kbd afterwards, you don't need an extra space.  <comment265597> Thank You @klanomath, my english isn't very good. <comment265599> I remember keeping a text file around so I could copy paste the tilde on old unix workstations. Was a real hassle and luckily OS X has better support.
