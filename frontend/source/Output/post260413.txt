For only one contact I do not receive text notifications - iPhone 6s <body> At one point I put this contact on do not disturb separately but took them off so I know it is not that I left it on do not disturb. It is ONLY this contact as well so it's not my notification settings, every time this contact texts me it just makes a noise that you would hear if you were clicked on the conversation just replying (if that makes sense, it's hard to explain!) so it's as if my phone thinks I am ALWAYS on this contacts conversation thread so I do not receive any other notification ! Please help, I talk to this contact everyday and it gets difficult knowing when they respond !
