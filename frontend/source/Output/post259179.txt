Need help to speed up MacBook Air 2013 <body> Can anyone suggest any techniques to speed up a MacBook Air 2013 ? I have a  fair share of storage in the SSD drive [77/128 Gb]. It is currently doing reasonably good but I wanted to check if it is possible to tune it up for better performance. I do not intend to upgrade RAM.  <comment324189> Can you provide examples of what tasks/functions you'd like to speed up? Also, are you saying you have 77Gb free or that you've used 77Gb? <comment324190> 77 Gb free. I do not mean any specific tasks but a general performance improvement and a smoother experience. <comment324195> Well, since you've already stated you don't intend to add RAM, there's probably not much else one can do in your situation. You're already running a SSD and you've got loads of free space. The only thing remaining, IF you've noticed your Mac has slowed down, is to do a fresh installation of MacOS etc. But it doesn't seem warranted in your case. <comment324217> Unfortunately, you can't.  The memory is fixed so you can't upgrade that and you can't get any more speed out of a new SSD than the one you already have.  You are pretty much limited to getting a new machine.
