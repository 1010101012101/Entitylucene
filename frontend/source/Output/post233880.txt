How to Locate an App Running in the Background <body> My Mac is a work computer that used to have LANDesk installed. My admin ran a script that uninstalled it. However, when my machine starts I still get prompted to allow apps from LANDesk (vulscand, cba, proxyhost) to accept network connections. Neither my Admin nor I can figure out where these apps are hiding.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vIiZC.png" alt="vulscand landesk app notice"  When I run codesudo find ~ -iname "LANDesk"/code or codesudo find ~ -iname "vulscand"/code in terminal both return no results. I also do not see it listed in the OS X Activity Monitor app.  How can I find where "vulscand" is located on my system?  <answer233891> Maybe it's a LaunchAgent? See here to stop. See here to remove.  If you want to find the actual file try EasyFind. It'll find things that Spotlight does not, especially non-user oriented files.  <answer233902> I finally found the LANDesk system files (and removed them) with finder:  ul licode/Library/LaunchAgents/code/li licode/Library/LaunchDaemons/code/li licode/Library/Preferences/code/li licode/Library/StartupItems/code/li /ul  To remove from launchctl:  precodesudo launchctl list | grep "name to find" sudo launchctl remove "label.of.the.file" /code/pre  <comment285840> It worked!! That is exactly where they were hiding. I'll add an answer with the exact steps I took.
