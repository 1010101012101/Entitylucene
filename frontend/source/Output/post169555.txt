Using VMware Fusion on Yosemite, how can I prevent crashes with sleep wake failure? <body> I am using VMware Fusion 7.1.0 on Mac OS 10.10.1 Yosemite. Every evening, I send my iMac to sleep. The next morning the mac usually sits in login mask - so it has rebooted. After login, I get "sleep wake failure".  How can I mitigate this? Are there any known workarounds?  I had this problem before with Mac OS 10.9 and VMware Fusion 6 but found no workaround. It seems, that with one of the updates of 10.9 the problem went away or was way more seldom.  <answer169683> After talking to VMware support, there are two possible solutions to this problem:  ol liOpen your Mac's system preferences, go to Energy Saver and disable the option "Put hard disks to sleep when possible". With that option deactivated, I had no sleep wake failures./li liPause or suspend your virtual machines prior to sending your Mac to sleep. /li /ol  <answer174703> I have this problem everytime I upgrade the OS. By turning off app nap for the entire Mac I was able to resolve the issue on Yosemite.  See the link below.  http://osxdaily.com/2014/05/13/disable-app-nap-mac-os-x/  <comment205772> Don't you think its enough to disable app nap for VMware Fusion? I don't see how doing this should resolve problems with VMware crashing the mac. <comment229915> Point 1) does not work for me, only point 2). And point 2) is the one I really want to avoid... <comment270062> This no longer works. <comment280932> I find it a shame that a commercial app like VMWare Fusion which used to work flawlessly for years suddenly has such a huge problem and doesn't seem to be able to fix it in a reasonable time. Is there a way we can put VMWare under pressure to resolve the issue? <comment292067> I also wanted to avoid point 2, but it seems to be necessary on my case. However, using **pause/unpause** is not as slow as shut down/restart, so apparently this is acceptable to me. I will post later if I have any new findings on this issue.
