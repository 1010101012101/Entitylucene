Disable "Optimized Storage" popup? <body> how can I disable this popup?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Busik.png" alt="storage popup" brPlease, no tutorials on how to use the optimize tools - or lectures on disk space. ;)br Thank you.  <comment332215> While I agree that I don't want lectures on optimized storage, IMHO it doesn't hurt to have a popup that notes that you're almost out of disk space.. it could be happening by some rogue process behind the scenes without you knowing it. Of course, it was probably developed for the people who never pay attention to their free space and keep dumping gigs of photos on to their drive... <comment332437> In my case it popped up with 17gb free. Indeed, I've been using computers for 30+ years and am all over each aspect of mine - which is why I always attempt to disable warnings like this, when they prove annoying. :-)
