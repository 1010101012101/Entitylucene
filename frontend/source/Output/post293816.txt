Command and Option keys on Windows keyboard <body> I am using an external keyboard which is a Windows keyboard. I am not able to use copy and paste command with ctrl and there is no command key or the option key in this keyboard. What is the shorcut for copy paste or cut paste on such keyboard?  <answer293818> The Windows key will operate as the Command key, so cmd-c is win-c.  Further, the Alt key will operate as the Option key.  <answer293833> In macOS the copy command is invoked by the key combo codecommand/code + codeC/code. The Windows key is normally the codecommand/code key. As your keyboard does not have a command key you can map that key behavior to another key.  To swap the behavior of keys, go to codeSystem Preferences/code -- codeKeyboard/code -- codeModifier Keys/code, select the right keyboard and set the desired behavior per key.   An option would be to set your codealt/code \ codeoption/code key to act like codecommand/code and have your codeCaps Lock/code act like codealt/code \ codeoption/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z4Y4c.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively you can use Karabiner-Elements to set more advanced key remaps.  <comment370798> You can swap the function of the keys (per keyboard) under System Preferences -- Keyboard -- Modifier Keys..  This way you have the same keyboard layout on both your internal and external keyboard. <comment370804> @grgarside No the Windows Key doesn't help in copy paste or cut paste. <comment370805> @Volsk can you please let me know which key to map in Modifier keys for copy paste and cut paste?
