Can you still make QuickTime to store temporary recordings on another drive? <body> I need to get QuickTime Player to store its temporary files on another disk. I found an answer here, which I tried, but QuickTime Player quits with an error when I try to make a Screen Recording. I used:  precode$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX $ mv Data Data.bak $ ln -s /Volumes/'Keeper 4'/QuicktimeScratch QTData $ ln -s QTData Data /code/pre  Does this no longer work, or did I screw something up? Keeper 4 is an external HD. I tried it with and without an existing QuicktimeScratch directory.  <answer206697> It seems that Apple doesn't want you to do this for whatever reason, so they prevent the symbolic link hack from working at the level of the codeData//code subdirectory. After fooling around with this, I found a workable solution one level up:  precode$ cd ~/Library/Containers/ $ mv com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/ com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.backup/ $ ln -s /Volumes/&lt;NAME_OF_VOLUME&gt;/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/ . /code/pre  No need for a double link trick this time around.
