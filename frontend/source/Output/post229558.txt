How to UNDO stopping OS X from writing Spotlight and Trash files? <body> I tried stopping OS X from writing Spotlight and Trash files to a memory card. The method by Metaxis to the question here "How to stop OS X from writing Spotlight and Trash files to memory cards and USB sticks?" works fine and I have used it many times, but this time I wasn't paying attention and have addressed the wrong folder. The question how to stop in the original post  This is what I did including the responses and replacing my first name with first name and full name with myfullname:  precodeMBP-van-firstname:~ myfullname$ mdutil -i off /Volumes/SD128MB /Volumes/SD128MB: 2016-03-02 22:57:40.638 mdutil[1232:208844] mdutil disabling Spotlight: /Volumes/SD128MB -&gt; kMDConfigSearchLevelFSSearchOnly Indexing disabled. MBP-van-firstname:~ myfullname$ rm -rf .{,_.}{fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes} MBP-van-firstname:~ myfullname$ mkdir .fseventsd MBP-van-firstname:~ myfullname$ touch .fseventsd/no_log .metadata_never_index .Trashes MBP-van-firstname:~ myfullname$ cd - -bash: cd: OLDPWD not set /code/pre  So, where the action were supposed to happen in the targeted folder, they were in the wrong folder. How can I undo this?  <answer229561> Looks like all you did was create some files.  You can just delete them.  precoderm -r .fseventsd rm .metdata_never_inded rm .Trashes /code/pre  <answer229576> What Metaxis described looks like it can be reverted with the following:  precodemdutil -i on /Volumes/yourUSBstick cd /Volumes/yourUSBstick rm -rf .fseventsd/no_log .metadata_never_index .Trashes cd - /code/pre  The first line with codemdutil/code is the most important if you want your volume to index again, as it sets the indexing status for the volume back to on, according to the manual:  precode-i on | off      Sets the indexing status for the provided volumes to on or off.  Note that indexing may be delayed due to      low disk space or other conditions.  /code/pre  h3EDIT:/h3  in your case (but this is specific to OP), you forgot to codecd/code (emchange directory/em) into the volume before deleting the index files and adding a few files. You just need to delete the files you created locally (in your home folder):  precoderm -r .fseventsd/no_log .metadata_never_index .Trashes /code/pre  No need to use codemdutil/code to re-enable indexing on your drive as you did the first command right and only did a mistake after the second command.  <comment288214> Thanks, I removed the files as LaX (and iWill) described.
