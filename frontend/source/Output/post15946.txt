Free .CSV text file editor for Mac OS X? <body> I am looking for a free editor to edit comma-delimited text files, or .csv format.   <answer21334> h1NeoOffice/h1  The latest version of NeoOffice works fine (in that it supports Versions etc) but you need to donate a small amount of money to download it before the end of August 2011.  <answer26505> h1Google Docs/h1  I just used Google Docs for exactly this purpose but all I needed to do was extract a column of email addresses from a CSV file.br Note: Google Docs has file size limits, so this is not a silver bullet. A great bullet, but those limitations are critical when applied.    <answer34530> h1XTabulator/h1  XTabulator edits CSV but is not free.     XTabulator is a tabular data file editor for Mac OS X. With XTabulator, you can edit, manipulate, massage, slice, and dice comma-separated (CSV), tab-separated (TAB), or anything-separated files quickly and easily.   <answer34578> h1csveditor (Java)/h1  Very simple (no undo), java program (some may stop reading here ;) - does the job    You have to create an empty table upon launch but then you can open any file.

Reads, writes, creates CSV, Excel, Word and an number of other formats.  <answer201121> h1OpenRefine/h1  When interacting with large and messy text csv and other structured text files, I now typically go to Google Refine (now called OpenRefine). I've used it for TSV/CSV, JSON, and XML documents. In my experience it crashes rarely, and is pretty good for mangling data (you can apply transformations with scripting languages).  Its approach is more database-oriented, rather than spreadsheet oriented.  <answer201127> h1Numbers/h1  emDisclaimer: Free on new Macs/em  Apple Numbers also opens and saves to CSV.  Just had to add to the list.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tylsr.png" alt="CSV in Text Editor"  h2Numbers:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GClBa.png" alt="Numbers CSV Edit"  h3Save as CSV after editing:/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIhCJ.png" alt="Export to CSV"  Note that you can choose emtext encoding/em as well when exporting if needed for other systems.  <answer242110> h1Table Tool/h1  Free and Open Source (MIT License).  Table Tool opens CSV files. It auto-detects character encoding and record separator (comma/semicolon/tab), and supports basic editing operations (like add row, delete row, add column delete column etc).  Table Tool can convert files to a different format.  Table Tool is also available on the Mac App Store.  <answer247008> h1Free Microsoft Office Online/h1  What better product than Excel is there to open and manipulate CSV files?    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O8URW.png" alt="enter image description here"  With this option, you don't need to install anything.  It has the convenience of Google Docs but the guaranteed compatibility of MS Office.  <answer272255> h1DB Browser for SQLite/h1  Not an obvious candidate but very powerful (and free).  h2Steps/h2  ol liCreate an empty Database/li liImport Table form CSV file /li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bZViD.png" alt="Table form CSV file"  ol start="3" liWith various import options/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vkPoT.png" alt="Import CSV file options"  ol start="4" liEdit, search, plot the data/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QipdC.png" alt="Table editor and plot of the data"  ol start="5" liExport your edits as (new) CSV file/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXRKV.png" alt="Export as CSV dialogue"  <answer272257> h1RStudio/h1  RStudio wraps a really nice IDE-like environment around the popular, open source R language. The R language "is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display."1 It includes facilities for importing and exporting CSV data from its built-in data store so you can work on it with its powerful toolkit and then export it back out to CSV.  It's free (as in beer and speech) for use with paid options available if you need someone to yell at when things aren't working quite right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V2BiA.jpg" alt="RStudio Importing CSV Data"  <comment17380> What do you need a special, CSV-specific editor to do that something like TextWrangler (or anything with column-based selections) can't do for you? Might help guide the answers if you could detail why something like [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) or CodeWrangler doesn't cut it for you. <comment23608> 24$ yuck, to test a beta, probably never... others are paying you to test beta :) <comment39499> I highly recommend NeoOffice. I have used it for eight years. It is a fork of OpenOffice and LibreOffice with Mac OS-specific features and fully suports Mac OS 10.7 Lion. You can download and use version 3.1 for free; only the most recent version 3.2 requires a donation. <comment195902> And it's fast to start and compatible with all the weird CSV gotchas floating around. +1 <comment242801> For my CSV editing needs (which are few) I use Numbers and TextEdit. <comment242802> Column-based selection won't help if the CSV has varying-width fields, right? <comment242803> Yep, that works.  For me, Textastic or TextWrangler and Numbers work just fine. <comment242812> You most certainly lost me at "Java" <comment258593> Is it possible to just save edits to an exisiting CSV file in place, i.e. just by pressing a shortcut key or click a menu item, without confirming the dialogues? <comment267305> Numbers doesn't really *edit* CSV. It imports and exports them, which is a much more awkward (and often useless) workflow.
