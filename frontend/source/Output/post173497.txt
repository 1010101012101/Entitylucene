Before that, make a backup of the Mac (or at least your critical files, photos, etc...) to be sure you don't make things worse. Disk Utility will sacrifice files to make the filesystem whole in some cases.  Also, you could boot into single user mode and run code/sbin/fsck -fy/code without mounting the root filesystem as an alternative if you are comfortable with that level of sophistication with terminal.  Post back details if you get hung up or if these details aren't enough to go on.  <comment204120> who is showing 39GB ? which app? <comment204122> Please show us a screenshot where you are seeing the system telling you 39GB. <comment204247> Or you could run ls -al in terminal on the directory to see what invisible files are there.
