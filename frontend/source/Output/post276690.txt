Water was poured on Mac and now it is fully dried, the Mac only boots halfway? <body> strongThe problem/strong  So recently I have poured water on my Mac and I shut the Mac down immediately and had it dried out for 2 months and I opened the Mac up so that it can air out more  So then after two months to be safe I close back up the Mac and tried to boot up the MacBook Pro.  Instead of booting all the way, when I type in my password, there is a boot bar and it would go around half way across and the screen would black out all the time and I repeated this for three times now and nothing has changed.   It should also be noted that I had the SSD on the Mac recovered at a computer store and I had it recovered on a hard drive with Time Machine.  I was wondering is the SSD damaged or is something else damaged and am I able to use Time Machine to recover the Mac?  <comment348298> My guess is that your SSD is probably fine, but that your logic board is shot. That's generally the case for water damaged computers. But I'd contact Apple, either by taking the computer to a store or by phoning them and asking them. They might be able to pinpoint exactly where the problem is and/or tell you how it might be fixed.
