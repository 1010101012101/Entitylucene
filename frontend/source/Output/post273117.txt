Show dialog at login (bash script) <body> The idea is that when somebody logs in to my Mac, a popup will show up and the date/time are written to a log.  I run the bash script from a cron job:  precode @reboot ~/Develop/login.sh  /code/pre  (I know about launchd but choose to use cron, much easier)  the login.sh script:  precode#!/bin/bash osascript &lt;&lt;EOD   tell application "System Events"   activate   display dialog "Unauthorized Login" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with icon caution with title "WARNING!"   end tell EOD  echo "$(date) LogIn Alert" &gt;&gt; ~/Develop/login.log /code/pre  I can execute the script with ./login.sh. All working well, the dialog is shown and login time is written to the log.  But when restarting my Mac the login date/time is written to the file (so the cron job is working), but the dialog is not popping up.  (I did look at the question Run AppleScript from bash script)  So my question is how to show this dialog when rebooting my Mac? (macOS 10.12.3)  <answer273119> You shouldn't need System Events just to display a dialog, nor can you strictly speaking 'activate' it...br try just   precode#!/bin/bash osascript &lt;&lt;EOD   tell me to display dialog "Unauthorized Login" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with icon caution with title "WARNING!" EOD  echo "$(date) LogIn Alert" &gt;&gt; ~/Develop/login.log /code/pre  I can't really test it as I'm totally clueless on cron/bash/osascript itself, but that would be all you'd need for a regular Applescript to display a dialog.  If that doesn't work, then the next step would be to set it up in Automator, as an Application, then set to launch at login.  <answer273166> You should run your script above not as a cron job but as described in this post (*) :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6442364/running-script-upon-login-mac  Make sure not to confuse running things on the login screen and running things on user login like in the question below:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22842016/launch-shell-script-on-login-in-mac-os-os-x?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1  Still, there is no need for you to log user logins as they are automatically logged. See "man last" and "cat /var/log/authd.log".  (*) Relevant part of the linked post above - or use launchd, as described in the link  precodestart Automator.app Select "Application" click "Show library" in the toolbar (if hidden) Add "Run shell script" (from the Actions/Utilities) Copy&amp;paste your script into the window Test it Save somewhere, for example you can make an "Applications" folder in your HOME (you will get an your_name.app) Go to System Preferences -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Login items Add this app /code/pre  <comment343362> I assume you do know about the "last" command - just to make sure that's not what you want. Also, I would use "syslog" to monitor user logins. See e.g. http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/143864/monitor-all-login-attempts <comment343363> No, the problem is that the dialog is not showing after a reboot <comment343366> Just out of curiosity...why are you allowing other people to log on in the first place? <comment343367> Would rather not discuss that here <comment343368> Just that I get you right - you want the dialog to appear when the computer reboots, NOT when you try to log in ? - because that's what you try to do with the code above. You want a popup with no user logged in, right? You can set the displayed message in preferences, but that's not a popup, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203580. System Events are not available at the login screen the way you attempt it I think. <comment343371> No, after logging in. I use the word reboot because that is when the cron job is running <comment343373> Exactly - reboot is when the cron job is running. Before login. That's the problem. <comment343379> If you want to do this *on login* you either have to have it run as a "Startup Item" or use `launchd`.  `cron` only works on time intervals, not on events like someone logging into a machine. <comment343381> It's better to put the relevant bits here and then post a link for more reference.  Links often go stale making the answer useless. <comment343384> Thats it, thanks. After all the cron job is not usable for what I wanted and I need to use launchd as described in the first link. <comment343403> Though not exact, it's a possible duplicate of [how to start a mysql server on login](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/268691/how-to-start-a-mysql-server-on-login).  The relevance is that this question asks the same thing:  *how to run a script at login*. <comment343419> The question is how to run a _script_, not an _application_. That's something different, the solution in the link won't work. But it should be renamed to "at login" instead of "at reboot". <comment344404> @user2707001 - there's no difference between running a script or an app through `launchd`. <comment344406> Sorry, do not have enough reputation to upvote
