Can't connect to Samba Share on Linux File Server as a Guest user <body> I have a File Server (Linux, Mint) running Samba which allows Windows machines on the network to connect as a Guest and read / write files to the shared folder.  I have a Mac book running El Capitan. This is unable to connect to the server and on trying to do so gives the following error  precodeThere was a problem connecting to the server "192.168.0.7" Check the server name or IP Address... /code/pre  I have tried using all of the following connection strings   precodesmb://192.168.0.7 smb://192.168.0.7/share smb://user:password@192.168.0.7 smb://user:password@192.168.0.7/share  cifs://192.168.0.7 cifs://192.168.0.7/share cifs://user:password@192.168.0.7 cifs://user:password@192.168.0.7/share /code/pre  But without any success.  I can successfully connect using a username and password and am able to read/write but I am just unable to connect as a guest.  The windows (xp) machines on the network can connect as a guest and can read/write without any issues.  <answer237314> Just to rule out the obvious. Are you able to ping those IPs? Maybe even nmap them to see if any ports might be closed.   <comment290585> Welcome to Ask Different!

Once that's done and you know that your server can be reached, what does the Samba log say when you try to connect.  It should be located in `/usr/local/var/samba` directory <comment291235> Sorry, yes I can ping and have since been able to connect as a registered user but am unable to connect as guest. nmap output : 139/tcp open  netbios-ssn 445/tcp open  microsoft-ds 902/tcp open  iss-realsecure <comment291237> Argh, seems to be working fine now... not sure what I'd done wrong... will attempt to setup again from scratch to see if I can replicate the problem but many thanks for all your comments etc.
