How do I avoid "message could not be moved to the mailbox Trash" on iOS 10? <body> Since upgrading to iOS 10, in certain e-mail accounts (notably an msn.com account) I cannot delete certain messages in Apple Mail. If I swipe left or open the message, and click the Trash icon, I get an error message      strongUnable to Move Message/strong       The message could not be moved to the mailbox Trash.   This appears to happen only for messages that have already been deleted via a different client (e.g., Apple Mail on macOS) but that still appear in iOS. No matter how long I wait, these messages do not correctly sync with the iOS client on their own, and manually deleting them produces the error above.  All the instructions I've found online for addressing this (apparently common) issue either do not apply to iOS 10 or simply have no effect (repeating the same error). The only way to delete a message once this error occurs for it is to disable and then re-enable the offending account, or delete and re-add the account entirely. The account then correct syncs with the server and shows the already deleted messages as gone. But that only works until the error happens again.   How do I avoid "message could not be moved to the mailbox Trash" on iOS 10?  <answer258869> This is a method I discovered when I encountered a mail glitch always displaying 1 unread email:  ol liGo to Settings  Mail  (Insert account name)/li liTurn the slider to "Off"/li liRestart device/li liTurn account back on/li /ol  That should fix your problem :)  <answer261541> This worked for me with an Outlook account:  ol liSettings/Mail/Accounts/[choose account]/li liSet the option "Mail Days to Sync" to "No Limit"./li /ol  This may or may not work for you, because not all mail accounts have the "Mail Days to Sync" option. Hope it helps.  <answer270122> All previous answers did not work for me.  I have gsuite / google apps paid account since that provides push mail. So none of the imap answers are very useful.  What did help was  https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/138740?hl=en and specifically going to http://m.google.com/sync/settings in your iOS device' browser.  That brings up a (unknown) mobile sync settings menu that is, well, very well hidden. Tick the second checkbox Enable "Delete Email As Trash" for this device to on. Click save.  Do this per device where this email account is used.  To clear the local mail cache, go to settings / mail / your gsuite account.  delete the account.  When done, reboot the iOS device. After reboot, go to settings / mail / add account. Add the gsuite / google apps account by selecting EXCHANGE (see help page above). Add m.google.com as the server. User is your full email address. check your email / calendar / contacts / notes preferred settings.  And all should be fine again.   <answer272918> Here's what I did to fix things...  (EDITED, BECAUSE PREVIOUS WAY DIDN'T WORK... EVERYTHING REAPPEARED)  Go in to settings  Mail  Accounts  (Account Name)  shut off "mail"  Force quit the mail app; force quit settings app.  Re-open mail app. It should not show any mail from that account. Force quit mail app again.  Then reopen settings, re-enable mail. Everything is re-synced. Re-open mail app.  <answer280674> WARNING: Do not use these steps if the email account is configured POP in iPhone settings (Possible Data Loss).  I had this same issue this morning and since my email account (Outlook) that was having prolems was set up using IMAP settings, I was able to resolve the issue using the steps below:  ol liEnsure you're running the latest version of iOS; go to iPhone  Settings  General  Software Update to check for updates./li liGo to iPhone  Settings  Mail  Accounts  Select the affected account(s)  Delete Account; this will completely remove the account from your device./li liForce your device to restart; iPhone 7 users press and hold power + volume-down button until you see the Apple Logo, all of the other iPhone models can perform a Force Restart by pressing and holding both power + home button until the Apple Logo appears./li liOnce the iPhone restarts, re-add the account in iPhone  Settings  Mail  Add Account./li /ol  The steps above helped me resolve the issue, after I'd already tried the steps below:  ol liRestarted iPhone./li liChanged the "Mail Days Days to Sync" settings in iPhone./li liDeactivated Mail account in settings and reactivated Mail account./li /ol  <comment322452> What happens if you go into the list of Mailboxes and pull down to refresh? What about refreshing from inside the Trash mailbox? <comment322454> @Phong: Nothing (of course). <comment323748> As stated in the question even when I "disable and then re-enable the offending account, or delete and re-add the account entirely" the fix only works temporarily. <comment323879> I'm stumped. Sorry. Have you considered backing up and resetting your device? <comment343055> Why don't you try my fix instead of immediately down voting it? I had the same issue and what I wrote fixed it. <comment343056> @ChadL: Your answer does not address the question. <comment353024> This was attempted and had no lasting effect, as described in the OP: "The only way to delete a message once this error occurs for it is to disable and then re-enable the offending account, or delete and re-add the account entirely. ... But that only works until the error happens again." <comment353124> I'm not seeing where the OP describes they've ensured they're on the most up-do-date version of iOS (currently 10.3.1).
