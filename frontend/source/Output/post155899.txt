How to find the coordinates of a png within another png <body> I have a screenshot of my entire desktop, taken with Command-Shift-3. I also have a much smaller screenshot of an icon, taken with Command-Shift-4.  My goal is to find the (x, y) coordinates of the icon within my desktop, so I can click on the icon using cliclick.  I'm assuming the smaller image will only appear once within the larger image.  I've seen theoretical discussion of various approaches using imagemagick and the like, but I'm looking for a solution that actually works well on modern OS X systems and is suitable for a shell script.  Does anyone have a working solution to this problem?  I'm basically looking for the equivalent of ahk's ImageSearch but for OS X.  Here's an example image I want to find:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E6xBz.png" alt="The image I want to find"  <comment183386> Wouldn't it be easier to find an app that can tell you the current cursor co-ordinates... or do you need to track this if it moves too? <comment183387> @Tetsujin Exactly, I need to find the image regardless of where it appears on screen. <comment183388> Ouch - that's not going to be easy. Be simpler to grab the process itself via shell or applescript <comment183389> I'm guessing you need some kind of 'Cmd/right click, only if it's Thursday' type of construction ;-)
