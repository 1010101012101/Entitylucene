WiFi: No Hardware Installed and using wifi adapter <body> I am getting an error 'WiFi: No Hardware Installed' and am trying to use a micro usb wifi piece (http://www.amazon.com/computers-accessories/dp/B005CLMJLU). I know this hardware works fine as I've been using it on a Raspberry Pi but it doesn't seem to be recognized on OS X Mountain Lion or Lion. How would I tell the os to use this piece of hardware rather than built-in WiFi?  thx  <answer92335> To upgrade this to an answer, this Edimax piece needs a driver.  Drivers are available at Edimax's website for download.  <comment108299> Have you installed the appropriate driver?

Thx for comment. If you want to make as answer, I'll accept <comment108330> You're welcome.
