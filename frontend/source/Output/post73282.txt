How do I bind a key in OSX to open a new window of an application? <body> I can't find a way to do this. There's only binding to open an application. But the apps I want to use this on, (chrome, terminal, and finder) are always open. I just want to open a new window in the current work space.  I can kbdCommand/kbd + kbdTab/kbd then hit kbdCommand/kbd + kbdN/kbd. But kbdCommand/kbd + kbdTab/kbd can change my workspace if a window of that app is already opened in another work space.  <answer73309> There's no single way to open a new window with AppleScript, but codemake new window/code or codemake new document/code works in many applications.  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     make new window     activate end tell     tell application "Finder"     make new Finder window     activate end tell tell application "Terminal"     do script ""     activate end tell tell application "TextEdit"     make new document     activate end tell /code/pre  You can assign shortcuts to scripts with applications like FastScripts or Alfred.  You can also open new windows from the Dock:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MRozy.png" alt=""
