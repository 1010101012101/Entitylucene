Is there a relatively straight forward way to make a note of all applications/programs installed on my mac for future reference? <body> Is there a relatively straight forward way to make a note of all applications/programs installed on my mac for future reference, without having to note down each application one by one via word etc  <answer72523> ul liOpen code/Applications/code in the Finder/li liPress kbdCmd-A/kbd followed by kbdCmd-C/kbd/li liSwitch to Pages/Word/TextEdit/etc./li liCreate a new document and press kbdCmd-V/kbd/li /ul  Repeat for sub-folders of /Applications and any other place (~/Applications maybe) where you have installed applications.  <comment84213> Hi Patrix thanks very much for that, as far as i'm aware I think 90% of my Apps are in the Applications folder, although I have noticed a few when I go into system preferernces right at the bottom such as Avast, Flip WMV. Not quite sure what they are doing there ! <comment84215> Welcome to AskDifferent. The usual way to say "thank you" is the upvote button :-). To your followup question: System extensions of any kind are usually installed in /Library or ~/Library, but they are more difficult to collect afterwards. <comment84216> Ah yes that right, these are known as system extensions :). <comment84217> Do I click on the tick button as well, or do people just add comments and there input as they please? <comment84218> Upvote - I like this answer/good answer/good idea/thank you. You can upvote as many answers as you like, also on questions others have asked. Accept - I accept this as the answer to my question. Only for your own questions and only one per question. Comments can be added anytime. <comment84219> I clicked on the tick and it has now turned green, i clicked on the upvote (but no sure what happened) <comment84221> It says in order to vote up I need "15 reputation", so I dont think I can vote up just yet, as I'm new to this forum ! <comment84222> Read the FAQ, vote for some other questions/answers you like or fill out your profile to get more reputation. <comment84226> OK thanks for that :) <comment116119> this did not work for me.  E.g. i just installed Sublime Text and it is not showing in the list even after doing `Cmd-A` followed by `Cmd-C`
