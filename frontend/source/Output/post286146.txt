"Unable to obtain authorization for this operation" when trying to reset my default keychain <body> I've not been able to save new passwords to my keychain lately.   In addition, I can't view any of my passwords. I'll open Keychain Access, pick a login entry, click the codeShow Password/code checkbox, and enter my account password. When I do this, I get an error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ku4gw.png" alt="not authorized"  This is really weird considering my account is an Admin user:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pzoKl.png" alt="I&#39;m an admin!"  Keychain Access isn't my main password repository so I don't really care if I need to reset it. I tried going into Keychain Access to reset my default keychain.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oYvc5.png" alt="trying to reset"  When I do this I receive the error message:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9QS3X.png" alt="wtf"  Like I said, I'm an admin for my computer. There is another admin account that was setup when this computer was imaged, but that account shouldn't own emmy/em keychain, right?!  I tried looking for Keychain First Aid but apparently that's been removed.  I'm running 10.12.4.  Any ideas of what's going on and/or how to fix it?  <answer286378> I was able to fix this issue by restarting my computer in recovery mode and using disk utility's First Aid to repair all volumes and the disk itself. I don't know which repair actually fixed the issue, but when I restarted I was able to view and save items in my keychain.   You can enter recovery mode by restarting your computer and holding down the keys codecommand/code and coder/code. Once you're in recovery mode you can select "Disk Utility" to get to the First Aid tool.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wgZtw.png" alt="enter image description here"   Once you're here you can click on each of the volumes (the indented names on the left. E.g. codeMacintosh HD/code) and then click the First Aid button.   I repaired both of my volumes and the disk itself (the codeAPPLE SSD SM.../code). The first aids for the volumes and the disk itself do different things.   After you're done, restart your computer and try to use/view your keychain. Cross your fingers and hope you don't have to do more googling!  <comment360963> Are you able to see your keychain if you run `security dump-keychain -d login.keychain` in Terminal? If it fails, what is the error message? <comment360967> Hmm, so it looks like i have a mix of what I'm assuming is correct data being spit out (keychain paths, version, class, attributes, and data) and then from time to time the error message: `security: SecKeychainItemCopyAttributesAndData: The user name or passphrase you entered is not correct.` <comment360968> Do you not get a [prompt like this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dFaXC.png)? When I run that command, if I click Deny, the error message you mention is printed for that item. <comment361119> Sorry, I missed this reply yesterday. No I didn't get a prompt like that. It just started dumping text into the terminal.
