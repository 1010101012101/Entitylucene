When I try to sync my iPad, I get an "Unknown Error (-39)" <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ld7TG.png" alt="alt text"  It still seems to sync most things - the error occurs late in the sync toward the end of the last step, which seems to be photo-related, and my apps are up to date, etc.  The main thing I've noticed that's off is my pictures - when I open the pictures app, I get a message saying:      iTunes Sync Needed - High Resolution   images synced via itunes are missing.    Connect your device to the computer   you sync photos from and launch iTunes   to sync them.   Since the issue seems like it might be photo-related, I tried repairing my Aperture library's permissions and database - no help.  Any ideas?  <answer3868> Try turning off photo sync completely, syncing, and then turning it back on.  <comment3649> @Kyle, that worked- thanks!  (Although it makes me feel a little like the guy who calls support without restarting.)  Care to make it an answer, so I can accept it, and the next person who runs into it will find the right solution? <comment3650> ok, done, glad it worked for you
