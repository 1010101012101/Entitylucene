Space Occupied By Other Files And Folders On Hard Drive <body> I have been using VirtualBox to create a virtual machine to run Windows 8 on and after deleting the virtual drives and virtualbox due to having issues with Windows 8, I am missing a lot of memory from my hard drive. I currently also have 72GB of backups on my Hard Drive that I did not create, any ideas on how to get rid of them?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h9yrR.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I view my Hard Drive contents via Disk Inventory X it comes up that I have nearly 99GB of space occupied by other files that not even Disk Inventory X can identify!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n9psW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Area of other files:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Toj7a.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer105024> Have you attempted to empty the trash after removing the VM? Alternately, I believe that VirtualBox keeps its data at "~/VirtualBox VMs". Removing that folder may help you to reclaim drive space.  Here's more info on TimeMachine's local snapshots. If you'd like to disable that feature, you can use these commands to perform that action:  precodesudo tmutil disablelocal /code/pre  Here's how you can re-enable local snapshots:  precodesudo tmutil enablelocal /code/pre  Here's how to take a snapshot:  precodetmutil snapshot /code/pre  <answer169929> Maybe a little bit different issue, but I also had a huge chunk of emSpace Occupied By Other Files And Folders On Hard Drive/em on my external disk. I found the culprit by using OmniDiskSweeper with root priveleges, as explained here.   That means: codesudo /Applications/OmniDiskSweeper.app/Contents/MacOS/OmniDiskSweeper/code  In this case it was files in the trash bin, which for some reason were not deleted when emptying it. The following command then solved my problem (source):   codesudo rm -rf /Volumes/ExternalHD/.Trashes/code  <comment123544> The removal of localsnapshots worked!
