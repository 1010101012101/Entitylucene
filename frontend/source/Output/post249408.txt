Apple Server.app setup hangs on `Preparing Mail service...` <body> Each time I attempt to install Apple's Server.app, I get a hang at the point wherein it says, codePreparing Mail service.../code.  I am trying to set this up via both the GUI and the shell (codesudo /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin/server setup/code) with the same result.  I've performed coderm /Library/Server/code and gone a bit further with removing some other folders:  precodesudo mv /.ServerBackups /var/db/.ServerSetupDone /Library/Preferences/com.apple.serverd.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.servermgr_accounts.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.servermgr_certs.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.servermgr_info.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.servermgrd.plist /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.apple.serverd /Library/Server ~/tmp/server_backup /code/pre  Any idea of any other steps I can take to troubleshoot this here?  I've been thinking that perhaps I can use codesudo iosnoop/code or such to scrub through what files may be active during this setup, but I've not really been able to isolate any problems so far...  <comment309351> Is this a new Mac setup or was server installed on an older OS? Typically mail isn't configured when you run setup - but perhaps there's some history? (I'll see if I have any ideas - but `fs_usage` and `tail`ing the system.log and install.log might be where I'd start looking as I don't use `iosnoop` much. <comment309352> Also - can you run `/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin/serverdiagnose` run when things are stuck? <comment325556> Another good place to look for info on what is happening during setup/promotion is `/Library/Logs/ServerSetup.log`
