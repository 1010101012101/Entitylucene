If I delete an episode from my iPhone, will it still be available on iTunes? <body> I want to delete an episode from my iPhone so I can watch a different episode (because I took up so much space with music and such).  If I do, it won't permanently delete, will it?   Will it still be on the iTunes account, but not on this device?  <answer76221> It depends on two things:  ol liIf you have a computer or another device set to automatically download purchases, you will have that copy as long as it is online and the download completes successfully./li liIf your account is in a country that allows TV eposides to be re-downloaded (usually called iTunes in the cloud) you could re-download the episode later as long as the studio doesn't withdraw it from sale or download./li /ol
