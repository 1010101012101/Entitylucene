Any way to get the "Open With..." list via AppleScript? <body> I want to create an AppleScript that gets the Finder selection and displays a list of applications that are capable of opening it.  In other words, is there any way to get the list of apps that appears when you use Finder's "Open With " contextual submenu?  <answer61692> One option would be to use AllApplications in a shell script:  precodetell application "Finder"     set p to POSIX path of (item 1 of (get selection) as text) end tell set l to do shell script "~/bin/AllApplications -path " &amp; quoted form of p &amp; " | sed 's/.*\\///g;s/\\.app$//g' | sort -f | uniq" set answer to choose from list (paragraphs of l) without multiple selections allowed if answer is false then return set a to item 1 of answer set p to path to application a tell application "Finder" to open selection using p /code/pre  You could also use System Events to get the applications from the Open With menu:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Finder"     set l to name of menu items of menu 1 of menu item "Open With" of menu 3 of menu bar 1 end tell set text item delimiters to linefeed set l2 to do shell script "grep -vx 'missing value' &lt;&lt;&lt; " &amp; quoted form of (l as text) &amp; " | grep -vx Otherâ€¦ | sed -E 's/ \\([^)]*\\)$//g;s/ \\(default\\)$//g;s/\\.app$//g' | sort -f | uniq" set answer to choose from list (paragraphs of l2) without multiple selections allowed if answer is false then return set a to item 1 of answer set p to (path to application a) tell application "Finder" to open selection using p /code/pre  I didn't really test the scripts, but they're probably affected by rdar://9406282: Finder scripting selection may refer to bogus value not correlated with UI.

Fantastic! They both work; the AllApplications method is much faster. Thank you!
