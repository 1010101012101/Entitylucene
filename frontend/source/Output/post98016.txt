Ethernet connection turns off when my Mac idles <body> I often leave my Mac for some time to do assorted tasks. When I return and log into the screensaver, I can't visit my homepage, Google, because the Ethernet connection has disconnected, requiring a few minutes to reestablish DHCP before I can Google again. Is there a way to keep the Ethernet connection alive while my computer idles?  I'm using Mac OS X 10.8.4 Mountain Lion x64; on a 2013 MacBook Pro 15"; with an official Apple Mini DVI to Gigabit Ethernet adapter; plugged into a good cat5 cable.  <answer98019> I had similar problem with the wifi I use.  It would disconnect me after certain time of inactivity.  So when downloading big stuff it would disconnect me, unless I was active on the computer/web.  To prevent wifi been disconnected during long downloads or me not interacting with it:  In Terminal I entered following:  precodeping -i600 google.com /code/pre  That would send a ping to Google than wait 600 seconds to send another ping and on and on...till I hit the kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdC/kbd to stop it.  That will tell wifi I am active so it will stay up all the time.  The 600 sec (10 minutes) is a choice, and it worked for me. In my case it was the WiFi service provider that cut me off after been inactive for a while.  <comment115025> `Spotlight - System Preferences - Energy Saver - Power Adapter - Computer sleep - Never`  and  `Energy Saver - Battery - Computer sleep - Never` <comment115644> When you're ready to stop this, press Control+C. <comment373891> While that will work, you really shouldn't have to do that. Call it a short term solution to a long term problem
