Moving file between disks in Mac OS X? <body> Is there any way so when I drag and drop a file from one disk(A) to another disk(B) the files are moved instead of copied? I have a mac book pro and a mac pro(old cool one) and when I drag and drop files they get copied instead of moved. So could I do some automate script or terminal command to enable move files from disk to disk instead of coping them?   <answer145616> You can press the kbdoption/kbd key to change the behaviour  ul limove instead of copy between different volumes/li licopy instead of move on the same volume/li /ul  <answer217507> Hold the "Command" key down, not the "option" key, while dragging your file between hard drives.  You will know that you have done it correctly because the progress bar will say "moving" instead of "copying"  <comment171608> The last sentence says "with in disk" but earlier say one disk to another - what do you mean <comment171609> My bad that is a typo, is plural so i can move files from disk to disk that are inside my machines. <comment171610> that works great, didn't knot existed. thanks, but is there any way to always say move instead of copy when the volumes are `/dev/disk2`  &&  `/dev/disk3s2` <comment171613> maybe a automator or command like to change the settings in the kernel? <comment310157> works on 10.11 :)
