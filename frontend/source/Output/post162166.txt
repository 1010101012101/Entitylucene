How to use OSX to create a bootable USB key to install Windows 8.1 on a PC <body> I have a PC laptop without OS and I would like to install Windows 8.1 on it.    How can I prepare a bootable Windows USB key in Yosemite?    I have to use OSX to prepare the bootable USB Key, as I have no Windows machine to create it on.br Is it possible? How can I do it?  I saw this post: Creating A Bootable USB Of Windows 8.1 On OS X? but here the final destination seems another Mac.br Have I to follow the same procedure?  <answer162179> Quick shot:  ol liDownload and install VirtualBox/li liCreate a new Windows VM with your Windows 8.1.iso (x64)/li liCopy the Windows 8.1.iso (x64) to your VM (network sharing)/li liDownload and install Rufus/li liPlug in your thumb drive and attach it to the VM/li liCreate a bootable thumb drive with Rufus. You may even choose UEFI or BIOS./li /ol  Not smart but it should work...  emI'm searching for a faster way without creating a VM/em  <comment189532> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about running OS X on non-Apple hardware. <comment189534> Not sure it is - I read it as using OS X to create a bootable Windows USB stick, to then use that to install Windows on a PC. <comment189536> This question has been put on hold for the wrong reason. <comment189537> I've edited for clarity of intent & voted to re-open <comment189540> As from 10.10 I am not quite sure if it is still possible to make NTFS journal. However, once you got bootable it does not matter what the destination is: another mac or windows. <comment189545> I really didn't get, why this question received a "-1" ...rules that I will never understand... so, any ideas how to solve this? <comment189548> I'd follow the linked method & see where you get; after that, this question could be edited to clarify any additional difficulties you face. <comment189550> i tried the linked method for create a bootable key.  the boot loader in the pc doesn't recognise the key... <comment189554> @ehijon UEFI or BIOS boot method? Or better add the laptop model to your question. <comment189576> UEFI Lenovo Ideapad S400U <comment189579> @Klamath... hehe, i thought to do something like this, but it's looong process... i'll try it in case :)
