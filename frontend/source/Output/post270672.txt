Chrome does not "Warn Before Quitting", but this option is selected <body> In the strongChrome/strong menu in the menubar, I have ticked "Warn Before Quitting (âŒ˜Q)".  But when I quit Chrome, no warning is ever given to me. The application quits happily.  Do you know how to fix this issue, so that Chrome does indeed warn the user before it quits?  hr  Chrome is up to date (Version 55.0.2883.95 64-bit).  My Macbook Pro is running OS X El Capitan, 10.11.6.
