How can I transfer iMessage/SMS messages from Mac to iPhone? <body> I have a huge problem. I’ve restored my iPhone without first making a backup. I have all my iMessage/SMS conversations on my Mac (macOS Sierra).  Is there a way I can transfer those conversations to my iPhone?  <answer294233> There is no built-in way to achieve this. Someone may provide a manual way by fiddling with the messages database, but it will be quite difficult and error-prone.  In iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 High Sierra however, messages will sync across devices over iCloud. If Apple follows its typical release schedule, we can expect them both to land around the third week of September.  At that time you can simply enable that feature on your Mac, and it will upload all your old messages to iCloud. Enable it on your iPhone, and it will download them all.  If you’re willing to wait a month or two, you’ll get all your conversations back onto your iPhone with minimal effort.  strongUpdate 8/7/2017/strong: After facing some issues in early iOS 11 betas, strongiCloud Messages/strong has been pushed back to a later date. The feature is still planned; it just may not make the initial September release.  <comment373872> Is there official confirmation that it will upload history? <comment373923> Yes, as per Craig Federighi at WWDC. That is also how it worked in the iOS 11 and High Sierra betas before it was pushed back.
