Easy alternation between different Java version installation <body> I currently have codeJava 6/code installed on my system (please don't laugh) and we are moving to codeJava 8/code. So we have changed the main branch of our application to use Java 8, however, we need to support old versions that run on Java 6. So we need to easily alternate.  I understand that codejava/code (command) points to code/usr/bin/java/code, which is a symlink to code/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java/code.  That directory looks as follows:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions@16:44:32&gt;ls -la total 64 drwxr-xr-x  11 root  wheel  374 Jun 16 16:39 . drwxr-xr-x  12 root  wheel  408 Jun 16 16:43 .. lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 Jun 16 16:39 1.4 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 Jun 16 16:39 1.4.2 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 Jun 16 16:39 1.5 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 Jun 16 16:39 1.5.0 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 Jun 16 16:39 1.6 -&gt; CurrentJDK lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   10 Jun 16 16:39 1.6.0 -&gt; CurrentJDK drwxr-xr-x   8 root  wheel  272 Jun 16 16:43 A lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    1 Jun 16 16:39 Current -&gt; A lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   59 Jun 16 16:39 CurrentJDK -&gt; /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents /code/pre  I can install Java 8 without uninstalling Java 6 and would like to have a mechanism of easily repointing the related commands in /usr/bin from code/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/code to code/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.8.0.jdk/Contents/code.  Is there a quick and existing way of doing it as opposed to writing my own script when I have to go to legacy branches/versions of our app for troubleshooting and PROD support? Like flip the java alternative from 6 to 8 and it does it all for you.  <comment161611> Don't laugh at Java 6! It's the only Java my Snow Leopard server can run. ;) <comment161621> 1) Did you try changing versions from the command line: java -version: version number . 2) Is it possible for your purposes to use java from the command line, you could set the old JVM with PATH.
