How to package a command line software to an Application <body> I have a command line executable (written in C) with some related resources, and I would like to package it as an application (inside the .app folder). I tried codeappify.sh/code which could package shell script, but didn't work here. For this command line executable, I would like to open termial to show the STDOUT.   I also found this method using Automator , but didn't find how to package the executable and resources inside the folder. Should I write an Info.plist file? I tried but failed to get the right syntax.  h2update/h2  As I tested, you cannot run the executable alone, as MacOS will run that without any pop-up window(Termial), and ignore all STDOUT.   We can use Platypus to run sh/bash with code-exec executable/code to do the trick as described here.  <answer261480> Use Platypus to make the app and then add your resources.  <comment327417> Hi, I have tried that, but it seems that it only supports scripts but not binaries. If I replace the generated binary with my executable file, it won't work any more. <comment327418> @leetom, use your executable as the script in Resources. If that doesn't work, use a script that execs your executable. <comment327423> That works, thank you! I tried that but with wrong work directory and it turns out Resources folder is the default work directory.  I found this solution with `/bin/bash -exe binary` [here](https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus/issues/47).
