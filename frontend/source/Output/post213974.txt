How do I stop my iMessages appearing on my MacBook Air? <body> I updated my MacBook Air to El Capitain (OS X 10.11) I would rather not have my messages appearing on my Mac when others are using it.br I have tried strongSystem Preferences/strong but I cannot find the Accounts tab in my settings.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  <answer213993> The best practice would be to have other users set up with their own logins on your Mac or to use the Guest account.  They would never see your messages in that case.  But, if you really wish to disable iMessages from appearing on your Mac:  ul liGo to strongMessages/strong/li liOpen the strongPreferences/strong Messages  Preferences or kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbd,/kbd/li liGo to the strongAccounts/strong tab/li liIn the iMessage account uncheck "Enable this account"/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Cbq0.png" alt="Messages Settings"  <answer240093> This is how you really do it ; )  Makes a little more sense. http://www.imore.com/how-enable-and-disable-notification-banners-mac  System Preferences\Notifications\Messages "Message Alert Style = None" There is other settings there to make it even more private.  Very Easy!  Enjoy!  <comment258288> Use a different account for other users maybe? <comment294962> That doesn't prevent users from opening the Messages app and looking at them.
