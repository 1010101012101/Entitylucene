How to restore from a Time Machine backup when there is already a user account set up? <body> I can't figure out how to access my Time Machine backups since Apple replaced a defective hard drive.  strongSome Background/strong:  My setup: iMac 24" (Early 2009), 3.06 GHz Core 2 Duo, OS X 10.7.3. I have been running Time Machine to back up all files.  Source of original problem: 1 TB hard drive developed problems while the machine was still under AppleCare.  The fix to the original problem: I took the machine to my nearest Apple store, where the diagnosis was to replace the hard drive. I got the repaired iMac back three days later.  strongThe current problem/strong:  When I got home and powered the iMac up for the first time, I noticed that the Apple techs had already set up a new user account. Everything has been working fine, emexcept/em that this new user account is not the same as the old one on the machine (i.e. the one I was using prior to the hard drive problem).   As a result, I can't seem to access any of the Time Machine backups I made prior to having the iMac repaired.  strongQuestion/strong:  How do I access the Time Machine backups made before the repair? Is there a way to query the Time Machine backups for the user account for which they were created?  <answer42548> h1Migration Assistant/h1  This is the built in data transfer tool for Macs.  You can find it in code/Applications/Utilities/code. You'll want to do the following:  ol listrongPlug in/strong your Time Machine backup drive, strongopen Migration Assistant/strong and select the strongFrom another Mac, PC, Time Machine backup, or other disk/strong option: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2Iig.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect the strongFrom a Time Machine backup or other disk option/strong: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Uv2j.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect your Time Machine backup and click strongNext/strong./li liIt should show you your old user account, which will have a drop down menu to select all the things you can restore./li liFollow the prompts to restore./li /ol  This method will create a strongnew user account/strong alongside the one the Apple Store folks created for you. You'll be able to log out of the account they set up and log into your own.   h1Another option would be to:/h1  ol listrongNavigate/strong to code/var/db/code by pressing kbdShift/kbd + kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdG/kbd and typing in the path./li liFind the code.AppleSetupDone/code file and delete it.

You will need to delete the account the Apple Store folks set up for you if you don't want it anymore.  Good luck!  <comment48358> Your repair paperwork has a phone number to call if you want step by step help completing the repir. @mattlove has an excellent answer too.
