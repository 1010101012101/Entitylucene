Salvaging a Flash Drive that won't mount and Disc Utility can't erase, restore or repair <body> I have a Centon Flash Drive that will not mount.  It is not readable on the iMac nor a Windows 7 machine.  The drive cannot be reformatted by the Windows or IMac usual methods that this layman tried.  In another thread about this subject I've read:     Can you get the disk identifier? In Disk Utility, select the drive and choose "Info" â€“ it should read something like disk1 or disk2 or so. (But NOT disk0; that's your internal HD!)      Then open a terminal, and type in  precodesudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/diskX   /code/pre      (where diskX is of course the disk identifier you got earlier.)      Type in your admin password, and it should overwrite every block of the disk with 0x00 (i.e. erase it).      Then, you can format your drive.      [Please be cautious when doing this; I'm not responsible for anything if anything goes wrong ;-)]   I have OS X 10.6.8.  Will you tell me if I should try this and if yes, how do I "open a terminal"?  <answer135801> Yes, the above procedure should work, although note that there is no warnings or prevention methods against doing something wrong. Typing the wrong disk identifier could erase your internal disk. Have backups and be careful.  To open Terminal, go to /Applications/Utilities/ and open Terminal.app.  <answer180507> If you don't feel comfortable using Terminal you could try SDFormatter from www.sdcard.org just select SD Formatter for Mac Download and agree to the terms, it is a free app. I have successfully formatted sd cards that wouldn't mount.   <answer255754> First of all, I recommend updating your mac, as you are 5 major versions behind. The pictures might look a bit different from your mac as you are not running the latest version, but it should work the same. There are multiple ways to open a terminal. The easiest way to do this is to use spotlight. Launch spotlight search and type in terminal. How to launch spotlight search: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014. You can also use finder to go the folder Applications, then go to Utilities, then open terminal.app. Hope this was helpful.  <comment276193> Cmd+Spacebarshould open a spotlight search.  Type Terminal and press Enter <comment318660> a) Their Mac may not be able to be updated past 10.6.8 (I can't recall if 10.7 dropped support for any Macs, but it does happen from time to time). b) This question was asked two years ago.
