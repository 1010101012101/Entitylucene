Not able to Click with the Trackpad <body> I have a Macbook Late 2010, though it may not be in the best state, but it has been working. Yesterday suddenly the Trackpad just failed to click, I can do other gestures that is I can move the mouse pointer, I can do the 4 finger gesture, for multitasking but it wont click. I am not sure if this is a hardware or software issue as when i connected an external mouse that too was just able to move the pointer but not able to click. I am not sure if I can provide the console data as I am not able to click anything at all. Is there a way to solve this?  <comment162370> Do you have a Magic Mouse connected via Bluetooth? Is that (or another) device holding down the left-click, canceling all other clicks? <comment162371> Try searching around online for fixes - many people have had your issue. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/111261/cant-click-with-trackpad-or-mouse-os-x-10-9-macbook-pro
