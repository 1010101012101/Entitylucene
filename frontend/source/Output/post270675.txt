Black Screen on MacBook Pro (Late-2011 A1278) <body> I'm experiencing a black boot screen and partial half-boot screen on my MacBook; the external display works fine with no issues. This problem started after an unexpected shutdown during sleep mode.  I've tried a PRAM and SMC reset, as well as unplugging all the internal connectors, but nothing seems to be working.  Sometimes I get halfway through the boot window (it progresses half way and then freezes), but from the external monitor, it actually boots and displays the login window.  The display backlight seems to work when I send the MacBook to sleep using the external screen. When I wake the MacBook, I can see it light up but nothing is displayed.  Also, I am unable to detect the internal display on macOS.
