Finder Isn't Responding Mac 10.10.1 <body> I am having a problem "Finder isn't responding" on my mac pro retina 10.10.1. All my files on my desktop are gone and the rainbow ball is spinning forever. I've tried many times to relaunch "Finder" by using command + option + esc, yet the problem still exist. So anyone has any idea to fix this problem?
