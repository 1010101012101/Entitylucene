iMac Fan runs fast and hard <body> Is it common for an imac fan to kick into full swing when booting up and never idling down even after 10 minutes? It sounds like a vacuum.  Would going in to the BIOS(no idea how to do that on a mac) and resetting help solve the problem.  <answer103279> Not normal. I had the same problem with an iMac a few years back and had to have the logic board replaced (under warranty thankfully).  You might have a SMC (System Management Controller) problem. This article explains how to reset it:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  You might also look at a tool like iStat Menus: http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/  What I found with iStat was that my CPU was running extra hot, hence the extra fan speed.  I did end up using an app called SMC Fan Control to mitigate the problem before getting the logic board replaced.
