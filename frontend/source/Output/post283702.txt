Set different volume for phone and clock <body> On iOS, is there a way to set a different volume (loudness level) for the alarms I set in the 'Clock' app?  I'd like to lower the volume for the alarm I use to wake up in the morning, but without lowering the volume for when I am on a call.  Right now I have to remember to turn down the ringer volume setting each night, then turn it back up when I am talking on the phone.  Can this be done?  I haven't found a way in the Settings app, but perhaps I'm just not looking in the right place.  <answer283708> There is a free application, called strongNightstand Central/strong (the one with the moon symbol) that lets you set the volume of the alarm as you like without changing that of the iPhone.  <comment357725> Welcome to Ask Different!
