Pages 5 - Bullets and numbering are not being copied <body> I have a Pages 5 document that contains a bullets list. When I try to copy the content of the document into Mac Mail the text is copied without the bullets. That behavioral is reproduced with numbering list.  Is there a way to copy that list with the bullets?  <answer111274> This is currently not possible. You can notify Apple that you would like this feature implemented using their Pages feedback page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html/li /ul  By the way, in case you didn't know, copy-pasting to other iWork apps works fine - bullets and other formatting is preserved correctly.  <answer144777> From OS X: Keyboard shortcuts:  kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdV/kbd: Apply the style of the surrounding text to the inserted object (Paste and Match Style)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/92Kgf.png" alt="enter image description here"
