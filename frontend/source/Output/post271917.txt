How can I fix FontAwesome problem in my psd file on macOS? <body> Here is the problem with Photoshop CS:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m5NTB.jpg" alt="The problem is about that font seems."  I installed FontAwesome icons to my Font Library also. It seems great.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1aoD6.png" alt="Installed font"  I read this post, Font Awesome displayed as question marks ion macOS, and I've googled this problem for 2 hours.  What should I do for grabbing that font icons name from my .psd file?   <comment341795> In my opinion it's unclear what you are asking here! Do you have a problem with the font changing the psd layout? Or that PS doesn't show the "character"/font name? <comment341806> i dont have any problem when i change the font, but i cant see fontawesome icons the problem is this.
