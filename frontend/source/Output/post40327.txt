How do I bulk rename albums in iTunes? <body> I have an online subscription to a radio program that allows me to download past episodes. However when they are opened in iTunes the album name is set in the format Apr 01 2008. The problem is that there are thousands of these and I would like to change it to a better format such as 2008 01 Apr or even 2008 Apr 01. Is there any automatic way to change an mp3's metadata - or a program like a Better Finder Rename that can edit this iTunes metadata for the thousands of tracks that I have?  <answer40330> You should check out Doug's Applescripts for iTunes. He's written a collection of scripts that will do most everything.  <answer40332> I recommend Doug's Applescripts for iTunes as a emgreat/em resource to keep in mind for any future questions you might have. From it I found the script that applies codesed/code to the track names. Once you follow the instructions to install the script, put the following code in the popup box:  precodes/\([:alpha:]\)+ \([:digit:]+\) \([:digit:]+\)/\3 \1 \2/  /code/pre  N.B. This is actually the first time I've used codesed/code, so I recommend testing this out on a few individual songs first.   (Also, if you don't have any programming experience, then it's likely that the Regular Expression above looked downright arcane. Don't worry! That's totally normal.)  <answer105169> I was using Doug's Script (the one that applies sed to track names) with this pattern:  precodes/\([:alpha:]*\)\ \([0-9]\{2\}\).\([0-9]\{2\}\).\([0-9]\{4\}\)/\1 \4-\3-\2/ /code/pre  to rename stuff like codeCharts 01.10.2013/code to codeCharts 2013-10-01/code.  However if you want to use it for Albums and not for the Title, you have to modify the AppleScript and replace codename/code with codealbum/code in the line that contains the codesed/code command  <comment123676> How does this differ or improve on Josh Tilles's answer? <comment124329> mine is for the european date format
