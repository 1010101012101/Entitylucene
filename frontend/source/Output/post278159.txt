I can't force quit an app (Wine)! <body> I installed Wine to open an .exe file on my Mac. I think I did something wrong and when I opened the file it installed to the Applications folder. Now, It doesn't let me force quit. I tried clicking "Force Quit" from the Apple menu and it didn't work. Now I can't turn my Mac off.  How can I force quit the Windows application running under Wine on my Mac?  <answer278162> Use Terminal to kill the Wine process.  From the Wine FAQ     h210.2 Crashes and Freezes/h2      h310.2.1 My program froze up, how do I close it?/h3      If you ran the program from a terminal window by typing wine   program.exe, you can usually just go back to that terminal window and   press Ctrl+C. If you ran the application some other way, such as from   a launcher shortcut, then you can open up a terminal and forcibly kill   the process:  precodekillall -9 Application.exe /code/pre      If you want to kill all Wine programs at once, you can run:  precodewineserver -k  /code/pre      You can also open up a Wine version of the Windows task manager by   running wine taskmgr in a terminal. This will allow you to kill   individual Wine processes.   <comment350045> If you want to force your Mac to turn off, hold the power button until it shuts off (about 10 seconds) <comment350087> @Noah That's far too drastic of a measure for something like this.
