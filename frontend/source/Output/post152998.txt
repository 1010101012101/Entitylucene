Multitasking on iPhone 5s while HDMI displays something else? <body> How can I keep HDMI playing movies while using other apps on my handset?  I initially thought that the adapter merely mirrored pixel-for-pixel, but during movie playback it is possible to reveal the double-tap application menu without affecting playback; selecting an app results on its being displayed on both displays and halting movie playback.  iOS 7.1.2, Apple Lightning-to-HDMI adapter, HDTV, Netflix app.  emI would prefer a factory setting or approved app to achieve this, but please do include jb solution if applicable./em  <answer156845> Lock the phone, swipe to the left then back. Swipe up to bring up the calculator and then unlock the screen. You should now be able to multitask.
