Screen doesn't turn back on <body> I have a brand-new Macbook Pro, my first mac since 1987, and unfortunately I'm experiencing a severe issue with it. If I leave it by itself for a while, or close the lid and then re-open it, the screen remains black and nothing I do can fix that - I have to forcefully shut down the mac (holding the power button for like 10 seconds) and re-open it.  I searched for this problem online and found many similar instances of it, but could not find any actual solution. How can I solve this issue? And if it's a still-unsolved problem, is there any work-around I can use to bring the screen back to life without rebooting the laptop?  hr  Technical details, as copied from the About This Mac dialog:  precodeMacBook Pro 15-inch, Late 2011 Processor  2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 Memory  8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 Graphics  AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB Software  Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74) /code/pre  ul liRunning software update reports that the laptop is up-to-date./li liI only got it yesterday, and have managed to install a grand total of just 4 applications (Keka, Steam, Syncplicity and Chrome)./li liI have emno/em peripherals connected - the only physical connection is the power cord, the only wireless connection is the Wi-Fi.

Since it's brand new, presumably it's within the initial complementary AppleCare period. Their tech support is emawesome/em, and if they can't solve the problem, you can take it in to an Apple store for repair, or they'll ship you a box and return shipping label to have the machine shipped to them and fixed, free of charge.  <answer33124> I've set the computer to emnever/em turn its monitor off and it took care of the problem - even after making the computer sleep and waking it up again it works.  I am now experienced a different problem, though, but as I cannot be positively sure it's related to this one I've opened a new question about it: Why might a Macbook Pro go back into sleep shortly after waking up?  <comment35086> @GraemeHutchison Clicking the trackpad, clicking random keys, pushing the power button, closing and re-opening the lid. <comment35256> Well the only thing available here is taking it to the store, and if I can solve it on my own without doing it it will save me time, which is why I'm asking here. I was hoping there's some well-known solution or common workaround, given the relatively high number of related issues I could find. <comment35275> You don't have free tech support via their 800 number? (1-800-MY-APPLE) [If you purchased your Mac within the past 90 days you're still within that period](http://www.apple.com/support/products/) <comment35280> Hmm, turns out they do have a phone number here (though obviously not the 1-800 number), I'll give it a go. <comment35284> Good luck Oak! Of course, I don't mean to imply I don't like to solve things on my own... I just know that Apple has great tech support and this was the first solution which came to my mind :-)
