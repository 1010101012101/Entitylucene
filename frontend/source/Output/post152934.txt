OS X Yosemite XCode update stuck on 'Waiting' <body> I recently downloaded Yosemite, and I'm trying to update my XCode.  I hit 'Update' in the App Store, and but it's been stuck at 'Waiting' for the past 30 minutes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4aQy2.png" alt="As seen in Launchpad"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UoMWE.png" alt="As seen in the App Store"  What can I do to fix this?  <answer153864> Yeah, a lot of people have been facing this issue. First, cancel your update. (In the AppStore update window hold kbdOption/kbd to show the Cancel button.)  strongNow, you can do two things:/strong  ol liDownload and install the strongXcode DMG from here/strong (if you have an Apple Developer Account)/li liOr try clearing your cache, and restart the download from the app store. You can use third-party apps or enter this command in your terminal:  coderm -rf "$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.appstore"/code/li /ol  <answer219199> Yesterday this happened to me during regular check for updates,  and between multiple restarts, and removing manifest.plist  things started working again.  precoderm "$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.appstore/manifest.plist" /code/pre  ( I actually did some renaming to discover that this was the file of interest.  <answer222035> Just wait it out. If you attempted a fix listed in another answer here, quit all applications, restart your computer, and when you boot back up, open the app store to the update page, click the update button and forget about it. It took mine about 20 minutes to actually start and move out of "waiting". I read reports that for some people it took about an hour for it to start.  I tried everything else before and was ready to do a full reinstall of xcode. Nothing worked but for me to just wait.  <answer227988> I solved the problem by moving Xcode from my Applications folder to the trash bin. I didn't have an option to cancel the update (all the buttons under Update in the App Store were grayed out for me).  Once I typed in my password to confirm the move, the App Store prompted me to either cancel the update, or delete the app. Opting to delete the app caused the update to start downloading immediately.  <answer232317> Just to add another answer here, I had two versions of Xcode in the launchpad. Opening one brought up a dialogue box asking if I would like to "Install additional components", which seems to have fixed it.   Apart from the two copies of Xcode. And now that Xcode is running, the "upgrade" is downloading. See what happens....  <answer237106> Everything is much more simple... Do not cancel anything, open AppStore and initiate the update (if you haven't done it yet); then click on the "Store" in the top-left menu and choose the following option - "Check for Unfinished Downloads...". Enter your Apple ID and password and you everything will be up and running.  The reason is that XCode does require additional confirmation before download.  Hope that helps.  <answer245109> This worked perfectly for another App Store download stuck in "waiting".  I quit the App Store, opened Terminal, pasted in code from Sheharyar's post above to clear cache, and pressed Enter.  Restarted App Store and was able to begin my download immediately.   <comment197961> After downloading the DMG Xcode can take a long time to startup because it Gatekeeper seems to check the application for a while, thats what happend to me. source: http://iphonedev.tv/blog/2014/9/8/xcode-6-beta-is-slow-to-open-fix-gate-keeper-slowness-with-the-terminal <comment201945> I keep forgetting that you need the kbdOption/kbd to show very useful tools. All I needed to do in my case was cancel the installation and restart it. <comment265003> @elhombre - thanks for the warning - getting xcode 7.2 re-installed took hours (literally) using the .dmg - to download and then install. And then there is the need to reinstall plugins, new documentation etc. Not a great user / developer experience when compared with say JetBrains IDE products whose upgrades are generally seamless. <comment272086> I'd also recommend using the commandline `softwareupdate` tool instead of using the app store. `softwareupdate --install --all --verbose` <comment274577> @onlynone Command line did not work to install Xcode. :( <comment274657> In my case it was a 'new purchase' on a new machine running El Cap (rather than an update). Just cancelling and then hitting install did the trick, without clearing the cache. <comment274724> @Ot√°vio I also did the cache removal first. The command line was just more reliable for me after that point. <comment285056> This seems like the most simple solution, and worked for me having tried a bunch of fancier ways. <comment290378> Just wanted to chime in and say this is what "worked" for me.  I guess the correct answer here in one word is "patience." <comment302111> Welcome to Ask Different!

It may work for others, so I didn't downvote. <comment315963> this worked thanks for sharing!
