Index SMB share <body> We have a Buffalo (ntfs formatted disk). I have connected my Macs via SMB and it's awfully slow. Is there way to index it before hand accessing folders, to make it faster ?  One folder with 500+ files can take hours to display thumbnails and/or access files, Windows machines will instantly pop, MacBook Pro and Mac mini having issues. Both have El Capitan.  I have tried also CIFS but no luck.
