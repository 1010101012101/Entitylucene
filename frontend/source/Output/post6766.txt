Why are FTP connections read-only when I use "Connect to Server..."? <body> I'm just trying to connect to the server hosting my website through Finder, but it's always read only, even though I'm logging in with my username and password.  Obviously, I can connect with an FTP client (Fetch), and through the terminal, etc. â€“ but what's the trick to FTP-uploading with Finder?  <answer6767> From Apple Support:     You can use the Connect To Server command to connect to an FTP server in the Finder, but you will have strongread-only access. You cannot copy, or upload, to an FTP volume in the Finder./strong   <comment7110> Good to know, I wasn't aware of this.
