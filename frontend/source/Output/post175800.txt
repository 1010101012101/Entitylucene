What causes the pop-up "To view this web content, you need to install the Java Runtime Environment" <body> On OSX Yosemite an annoying pop-up comes up quite often saying:     To view this web content, you need to install the Java Runtime Environment   I know the solution is to install java; however I'm wondering what's the cause for that.  A quick codeps -axww/code tells me:  precode13218   ??  S      0:00.29 /System/Library/Java/Support/CoreDeploy.bundle/Contents/Download Java Components.app/Contents/MacOS/Download Java Components /code/pre  I dug around and I found that there is a LaunchDaemon that references this in code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.java.InstallOnDemand.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.apple.java.InstallOnDemandAgent&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;MachServices&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;com.apple.java.installondemand&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/System/Library/Java/Support/CoreDeploy.bundle/Contents/Download Java Components.app/Contents/MacOS/Download Java Components&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Does anyone know what is the purpose of all this? The pop-up appears at random times, which makes me think there's a background daemon that demands Java to run but I could not find any source for this behaviour.  <answer229853> For my sister this was caused by Facebook videochat. We debugged quite randomly, and could not find a way to tell what triggered this dialog; like indeed codeps/code did not show what started it. But the following Apple Support Communities post explained how to find it by trial and error:     Here are the steps I used to correct, as even after removal from Launch control it kept returning on reboot:      ol   liOpen a Terminal Prompt/li   liShow non Apple startup Agents. At $ execute  precodelaunchctl list | grep -v apple /code/pre      This will look something like the following.  precodePID Status Label -   0      org.openbsd.ssh-agent 282 0      com.symantec.symsecondarylaunch.application 274 0      com.symantec.quickmenu.application -   0      com.google.keystone.system.agent -   0      com.valvesoftware.steamclean -   0      com.oracle.java.Java-Updater 276 0      com.Logitech.Control Center.Daemon 302 0      com.google.Chrome.62228 -   1      com.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.updater 295 0      com.symantec.scannotification.application -   0      net.tunnelblick.tunnelblick.LaunchAtLogin 275 0      com.symantec.savdiskmountnotify.application 317 0      net.tunnelblick.tunnelblick.119880 /code/pre      One of the returned items is likely your issue, mine was also codecom.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.updater/code/li   liChange to the Agents directory, codecd ~/Library/LaunchAgents//code/li   liI also had to remove the actual agent files, as it kept re-appearing on reboot. You can view those on your system and remove. List out the items in directory: codels/code  precodeSharedServices.Agent.plist com.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.plist com.valvesoftware.steamclean.plist net.tunnelblick.tunnelblick.LaunchAtLogin.plist org.virtualbox.vboxwebsrv.plist /code/pre/li   liFrom code~/Library/LaunchAgents//code execute  precoderm com.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.plist /code/pre/li   liAlso remove from Launch control with  precodelaunchctl remove com.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.updater /code/pre/li   liExit and reboot/li   /ol   If I recall correctly then this videochat thing might also have been a plugin in her browser, which we then already removed earlier.  <comment207438> "To view this web content" - have a look at your browser tabs/windows. <comment207439> @patrix: the odd thing is that the pop-up appears regardless of what tabs I  have open, or whether I've just opened a tab or not. <comment207444> There may be a browser plugin or an app launched @ startup which requires Java. A bit of googling finds some users get this with a Facebook video chat plugin, a baseball game streaming plugin, etc. If you have installed Java recently, and you still get these messages, it is possible you followed the wrong link to a version that has glitches under Yosemite. You need to find the correct version.
