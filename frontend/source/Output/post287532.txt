Looking for Text Editor with File Browser for logs <body> Need a text editor with file browser that will keep files sorted by date and allow quickly switching between files in the editor. Lots of log files to view through quickly.  TextWrangler only shows files in disk browser by name. Lots of other editors don't even have a file browser. Loved Notepad++ on windows. Anything close on Mac?  Need:  ul liallow browsing file system/li lisort files/folders by date modified/li liquickly show/edit files in main window by clicking/double-clicking filenames (no popup of separate windows)/li /ul  I've looked at log file viewers and they're mainly for viewing individual files. I have log files with semi-random names but I need them sorted by modified date to troubleshoot.  <answer287534> Use Atom: https://atom.io     strongFile system browser/strong      Easily browse and open a single file, a whole project, or multiple   projects in one window.   With log files it looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qg5ik.png" alt="Atom"  <comment363045> See [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for important guidelines that should be followed when asking for a software recommendation.

I only see them sorted alpha <comment363057> found a package that does exactly this: https://atom.io/packages/tree-view-sort <comment363059> and even better, a pkg to color code log files: https://atom.io/packages/language-log
