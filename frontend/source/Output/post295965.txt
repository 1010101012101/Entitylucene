Having USB 3.0 power output for Mac Sierra early 2015 MacBook Pro <body> So I had the above macbook (but with 8 GB ram and i5) and my Nexus 6P would 'fast charge' from the USB port  I recall at some point that MacBook showed a message about power usage of the usb device, I think it was warning me about my phone taking too much power.  I swapped out my mac for one with 16 GB ram and i7. When I connect my phone it doesn't fast charge.   This is probably because the port isn't giving 3.0 output.  My question is this - how can I override the default system settings and get them to provide 3.0 power output to my phone? It must be possible because I was able to do it with my earlier device of the same model and OS.  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) for both macs - first one was an i5 with 8 GB ram, the second an i7 with 16 GB ram   TLDR for clarity First mac rapid charged my Nexus 6p (delivered 3.0 power) First mac warned me about nexus 6p consuming significant power when I connected it for the first time  Second mac slow charges my Nexus 6p (2.0 power I'm guessing)   Not sure what changed, hoping someone can help with that  <comment373779> Though this question is quite confusing, the bottom line is that there is nothing that can be modified to change the power that is delivered.  The MacBooks conform to the [USB 3.1 Power Delivery Specification](http://www.usb.org/developers/powerdelivery/) meaning it negotiates with the device for the amount of power it gets. <comment373780> What Allan said. And edit your post to include the exact model of both Macs <comment373785> The ports on a 2015 MBP are *limited* to 1.5A.  You're not going to get more than that.  It's best that you plug it into the adapter that came with it rather than use your Mac as a charger. <comment373793> My earlier macbook pro (of the same model) was giving me rapid charging (which is over 2A of current) <comment373794> My question here is if there is anyway to get the mac to give the device more power. You have said as much in a comment that it isn't possible. Which begs the question of why the earlier mac I had was able to give a current value which constituted 'fast charging' for my phone
