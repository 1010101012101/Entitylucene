I didn't get the same log errors as you did, but it didn't work neither: the (pre-)encrypted Logical Volume just doesn't mount properly.  I solved the problem in my VM by deleting the whole Logical Volume Group and rebuilding it but with an non-encrypted Logical Volume.  Then open the Time Machine preference pane, choose the Logical Volume as Time Machine backup volume and enable encrypted backups.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ge2jO.png" alt="Time Machine preference pan"  You will be asked to enter the passphrase twice and to enter a hint.  hr  Alternatively you may try to mount the volume (after unlocking it) with   precodediskutil mount 37D10BDF-AF34-4252-AAD7-41D18AFFF9AE /code/pre  <comment261293> What do you mean by "fix"? Disk Utility does not report any error. <comment261430> I told about problem with volume, and fix mean fix issues on disk. Us we see up, man told about delete logical volume and create again without encription. Thanks for -1 bro ! <comment261431> I did not down vote "bro" but I didn't either up vote ... I just commented that there are no issues on the disk.
