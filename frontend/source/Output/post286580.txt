Unknown number instead of anonymous number <body> I've got a question, sometimes when the Caller ID is hidden, it will show up on my lock screen as "Anonymous". But recently, I've noticed something, there is a distinction between Anonymous and "Unknown", when missing a call.  Who can tell me what "unknown number" means, I suppose a caller either has the number hidden (anonymous) or shown (just the number that shows up, or a contact)? I also received a voicemail from the unknown number, which is just a 3 second message with a computer voice.  Who can clear this up for me?  <answer286582> Unknown means the carrier didn't send a CID response.  Anonymous means they populated it with the word 'Anonymous'.  <comment361628> Can I assume then that if the carrier doesn't send a CID it is most likely to be something like fake calls? <comment361968> Of course not.  There are any number of legitimate reasons to block CID.
