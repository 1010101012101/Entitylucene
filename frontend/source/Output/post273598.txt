MacBook Pro 2011 shows grey screen during boot <body> My early 2011 MBP stopped booting up. It now shows only a grey screen after about 1/3 of the boot up process.  I tried Verbose mode, where the last lines visible before the grey screen can be seen in the picture.  Could it be a faulty GPU? It is a MBP from the era with defective AMD GPUs.  So far I never had problems with it.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TxSbs.jpg" alt="Screenshot of verbose boot"  I've read that I can disable the AMD gpu by moving away the AMD kexts. However single user mode gives me sandbox violations if I do this.   The problem exists if I try to boot into Safe Mode as well.  I have run AHT extended and get a 4MEM/9/40… error. I guess this means the RAM is bad? Now trying only one module at a time.   With only one module, I don't get errors. Tried three AHT passes. However I still can't boot. Not even recovery with Cmd+R. Next step: internet recovery.   Internet recovery leads to the same grey screen and fans spinning. Next step: PRAM an SMC reset.   SMC reset did not help either. I fear I am out of options. I guess I'll have to get the machine to a service place…  <answer273641> I had the same problem. Your GPU is dead. There was a recall awhile back for my late 2011 model. Maybe Apple will honor it and repair yours for free.   <comment343978> Have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  Given that this is a 2011 MBP which have been known to have GPU, it's quite likely, but until you diagnose it, you won't know for sure. <comment343990> Nope. Did not know this existed. Will try! <comment343991> It's Option+D on my Mac. Extended test is running now. <comment344113> Well, went to a service point. Test shows it's the GPU. Service guy and Apple hotline say: bad luck. Machine is classifiedas vintage since 2017-1-1. so no more repairs… <comment344115> @Arne I feel for ya. Those things aren't cheap. I've considered buying a cheap Dell and then putting Linux on it for my next Laptop. <comment344215> I've used Linux since 1995 and still use it on my Raspberrys, but will stay with Apple. However I don't need a laptop, so will get an iMac instead -- Hopefully those are even more sturdy. Already got a laptop at work, plus the iPhone...
