Cannot connect to Apple and iTunes Store <body> I own an iPhone 4S with IOS 7.1.1 and started to use iCloud 2 days ago. Today, I couldn't connect to iCloud and the iTunes Store. It appears that I need a wi-fi connection to connect, but I've using my wi-fi for some time now without a problem. I can still use Google and What'sapp, but the iPhone is saying I need to have a good connection. I can use other apps that need an internet connection, but every time I open Safari it says that I need to have an internet connection. I even tried some methods to troubleshoot the problem by changing the date and time and rebooting and resetting my phone. Can anyone pls.
