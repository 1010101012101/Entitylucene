Can you (semi-)automatically rate all songs with at least X plays with Y stars in iTunes? <body> After reconsolidating my music collection in iTunes, I’m curious if there is any way to programmatically set star ratings based upon the number of plays, but only for songs that I have not yet rated?  strongSpecifically, I'd like to set all songs with 1 plays and 0 stars, to 3 stars./strong  (3 being the average in that I didn't care enough to rate the song lower because I hated it, higher because I liked it, because I was doing something else at the time.)  An AppleScript that I can run occasionally would be sufficient – this way I can passively set song ratings based upon an apathetic impression of the song :).  <answer30862> Create a smart playlist in iTunes with criteria set to emall of/em  ul liemis/em Music/li liemrated/em less than 1 star/li liemplay count/em greater than whatever count you want/li /ul  Check “update automatically”. Make sure the contents conform to the list of songs you want to rate automatically. Name it “Unrated Songs” (or similar).  Now create the following AppleScript:  precodetell application "iTunes"     set unratedSongs to tracks in (playlist "Unrated Songs")     repeat with unratedSong in unratedSongs         set rating of unratedSong to 60     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Save it to code~/Library/Scripts/Applications/iTunes/code (creating the folders that do not exist yet – note code~/Library/code is hidden under Lion: use the Finder’s “Go To” menu while pressing kbdOption/kbd to get to it or press kbdCmd+Shift+./kbd in the Save dialog to show hidden folders) as “Rate unrated songs”. You will find the script in iTunes’ script menu, ready to do your bidding.  <comment35440> If you'd like to create your own Applescript, this is a great place to start: http://dougscripts.com/itunes/. He doesn't have anything that does exactly what you need, but if you're familiar with Applescript, it shouldn't be too hard to roll your own. <comment35446> @Vickash Interesting, I think this site has examples that describe nearly every component that I need... I'll have a look around!  If I can construct a completed solution, i'll post it here. Thanks! <comment35452> Why the AppleScript? Once you have created the playlist, select all songs in it and select Rating in the File menu to set the number of stars you want. <comment35455> @patrix: the script spares you the step of going to the smart playlist and selecting everything – a minor convenience, but one step closer to automatical processing. <comment35459> Why 60?  Does that map to 3 stars somehow?  Is it 20 points per star?  Is it useful to have ratings at one point intervals (i.e. rating of 58)? <comment35461> @BillNace: internally, ratings are stored as value from 0 to 100 – stars map to 20 point increments. iTunes will round other ratings to the nearest star (or half star, if you enable that). <comment35463> PERFECT!! I implemented your script as an hourly cronjob, rather than run it manually in iTunes, and set the value to 50. By creating a another smart playlist, "Autorated Songs", which shows files that were greater than 2 stars **and** less than 3 stars, I can see which files were auto-rated without eating up a 3-star rating. Thanks!!
