Is it possible to create a text list of all my apps on the (Mac) App Store? <body> Since I can't copy the list of my 'Purchased' Apps on Apple's App Store, I'm wondering if there's any other way to do this. I have little computer savvy, so if there's a solution it'd have to be step-by-step. Thanks.  <answer280966> Both Klanomath and PeterVP provide suitable answers. If all you want is a list of the apps, I'd refer you to those. However, if you'd like other details included (such as Version etc) or you just don't like using Terminal, you can achieve what you want with these steps:  ol liGo to strongApple  About This Mac/strong/li liClick on the kbdSystem Report.../kbd button on the window that appears/li liIn the lefthand pane you'll see a list of headings and subheadings/li liExpand the emSoftware/em heading/li liSelect the emApplications/em subheading/li liAfter a while you should see a list of all Apps appear on the righthand side/li liNow click on the emObtained From/em column heading (this will sort your apps)/li liScroll down till you see all the apps labelled as obtained from Mac App Store/li liClick on the first app from the Mac App Store and then press and hold the kbdshift/kbd key down while you also select the last app from the Mac App Store/li liAs you do this, the bottom half of the righthand side window populates with details of each of your selected apps/li liOnce you've selected the apps, click on the bottom half and use the kbdcommand/kbdkbdA/kbd shortcut to select all/li liNow copy (or kbdcommand/kbdkbdC/kbd) your selected items/li liNow you can paste these into TextEdit or your text editor of choice/li /ol  I know this is a little messy, and it probably gives you a lot more detail than you wanted, so hopefully someone comes up with a better solution. But in the meantime it may get you where you wanted to be.  <answer280969> In systems up to 10.11.6 you can save the "Purchased" page as html file to disk:  ul liQuit App Store.app/li liOpen Terminal.app in /Applications/Utilities/li liEnter codedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true/code and hit the kbdReturn/⏎/kbd key to show the debug menu in App Store.app./li liOpen App Store.app (check that the "Debug" menu is available!)   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wi6mz.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you have some hidden purchases and want them to be listed also, unhide them in your account./li liOpen the "Purchased" page - log in with your Apple ID if required./li liHit kbdcmd/kbdkbdU/kbd/li liQuit App Store.app/li liBring Terminal.app to the front and enter:  precodecp ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.appstore/Data/Library/Documentation/pageSource.html ~/Desktop/pageSource.html /code/pre  and hit the kbdReturn/⏎/kbd key.

If you redirect the result to a text file like so:  precodefind /Applications -path '*Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt' -maxdepth 4 -print |\sed 's#.app/Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt#.app#g; s#/Applications/##' &gt; ~/Desktop/PurchasedApps.txt /code/pre  you will create a plain text file on your desktop named emPurchasedApps.txt/em.  This will list all applications strongdownloaded/strong from the App Store, bought and free. It will strongnot/strong show applications you once downloaded, but have since deleted from your Mac.  <answer281243> These are great answers but I'll mention the codemas/code command line tool here too because it's a single command for what you want (once you install it) and quite often Apple's App Store app simply doesn't work, and codemas/code always works.  Download the app here https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/releases (select codemas-cli.zip/code).  Developers can use codebrew install mas/code which is easier ...  Open a Terminal in the same folder where you unzip it, then type "./mas list".  You probably have to do "./mas signin" first, I can't remember the workflow.  <answer281304> Create a new Smart Search.

As an aside, I've just tested PeterVP's answer on both El Capitan and Sierra and that works nicely too. It's quick and produces nothing but a text file. <comment353623> Nice answer! And it works on Sierra as well. :) <comment353663> Unfortunately I updated fm Yosemite to Sierra a month ago (only because the iPod to Photos transfer was giving me problems). I wish I hadn't, not only because I keep getting the 'spinning ball', but because this beautifully clear solution may have been what I was looking for, as the list is created from the App Store, rather than my computer. Thx! <comment353664> Thank-you for this answer, which I found easy to implement, but I'd prefer a solution that included ALL my Apps on the App Store (some of which I never have installed). <comment353665> Another example of how to write an answer for a novice! Thank-you for this extremely NON-messy answer. I am saving it too, for occasions when I DO want more info, but as I commented to PeterVP, I was hoping for a list of all purchases from the App Store, as I haven't downloaded them all. <comment354192> Hi and thanks for the response. I tried this to no avail. I imagine this is likely due to my inexperience, rather than your solution. I unzipped **mas-cli.zip** in my Utilities Folder in Applications + then removed **mas-cli.zip** from the folder, leaving **mas** behind (in the same folder as the **Terminal** Application). I then typed **./mas list** and got **-bash: ./mas: No such file or directory**. When I typed **./mas signin** it said **-bash: ./mas: No such file or directory** <comment354205> Yeah it sounds like your Terminal prompt is in a different folder from the `mas` binary.  Your can find which folder your Terminal is in by typing `pwd` (present working directory) then navigate to the correct directory using `cd` (change directory). <comment354394> Ah! That was it. After typing pwd, I realized where **mas** needed to be, and installed it there. I then typed **./mas list** in the Terminal window and a list appeared. Unfortunately, it too, does not include uninstalled App Store apps, so I am still searching for a solution which works with Sierra.   p.s. as per your instructions in the comments above, after trying **pwd** I then typed **cd**, but as I didn't understand the result (which to my inexperienced eyes, appeared to be nothing) I carried on as I've described. Is it necessary for me to **"undo"** the cd 'command' (and if so, how? Tx) <comment354581> This probably isn't the place for a command line tutorial but here's a link to get you started https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/ <comment354752> Tx That IS an excellent tutorial (although I also had to look up the definition of a Directory! :) anyway...I am no longer worried. <comment354753> not ignoring your possible solution - but it IS a long article :) <comment355050> The article is there for anyone that wants more detail. The screenshot is all you really need. I added the text for the Raw Query to make it easy to paste into the search.
