Apply email rules to existing emails <body> I've added a email rule in iCloud to copy emails with a specific from address to a folder.  This is working fine, all new mails are moved to that folder. Is there a way to apply the rule also to mails that I've received before I crated the rule?  <answer135377> Use kbdcmd/kbd + kbdA/kbd to select all your mails, then right click on it = codeApply rules/code  Or as Matteo point out : kbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdL/kbd  <comment160464> or cmd+shift+L instead of Apply Rules <comment160486> I think this is only related to local rules in apple mail and not for rules added to icloud in using a browser.
