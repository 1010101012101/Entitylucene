Will it notify my mom if I turn off find my iPhone? <body> my email is my apple id so if it sent a email to my apple id that is ok, but i want to know if the person who pays for my phone, my mom, will get a notification. Please help.  <answer259271> No, if your email is setup on your iPhone and someone sends you an email, your mom will not be notified.   <comment324342> Your question does not make sense from beginning to end. Are you in the same family (iCloud  Family) as your mother? Is the iCloud Apple ID your mother's, or is it yours? Does your mother have access to your email address? I do not think of a way, other than these three, that your mother could receive a Find my iPhone notification (paying for a phone is just payment, there is no record of the payer on the phone).
