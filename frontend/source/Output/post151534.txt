After an upgrade to Yosemite, R is no longer in PATH <body> I just upgraded to Yosemite, and codeR/code (installed from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) is no longer in codePATH/code. Since this appears to be relevant to other packages, I wonder if there is a generic solution (not involving reinstalling everything).  <comment178345> The link you provided proposed a generic solution for re-linking your installed brew packages. Didn't it work for you? <comment178347> @HermanTorjussen: I installed R from R-project, not brew <comment178348> Then I guess the most general solution is to manually add back the relevant directories added by the R installer to your `$PATH` in `~/.bash_profile`.
