AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE environment variable on OSX <body> I need to type the flag code--profile fred/code in every command on the aws cli, I tried to set it up with codeexport AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=fred/code, gives error:       -bash: export: `=fred': not a valid identifier   Any idea how to fix this so that I do not have to retype this flag with every command? like:  $ aws ecs .... --profile fred
