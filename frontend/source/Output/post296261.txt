ERASE 2007 IMAC HARD DRIVE <body> I want to donate my old IMAC to a refurbished store. I want to wipe my hard drive. The problem is the power supply went out so it won't boot up. I think I can wipe the HD with a strong magnet like putting the computer on a speaker. But I want to make sure that I wipe the drive. Does anyone know where the HD is located on the IMAC so I can located it without opening it up? Also how strong a magnet and how long to apply the magnet?  Thanks in advance for any help
