Installing Linux on an old MacBook (no SuperDrive, won't boot from USB) <body> In short, the SuperDrive doesn't work and in won't boot from a bootable USB stick either. I tried everything, it results that Mac's from before 2010 can't boot via USB except when it's an USB with macOS obviously, no matter how many different EFI utilities do I install (rEFIt, rEFInd, you name it), and how many different apps to make a bootable USB do I use, it won't recognize the USB.   There should be the option of using a virtualization program trick to install it in a existing physical partition but I can't find anything right now, only a tutorial for Windows that needs Winclone and I'm guessing it won't exactly work with a Linux distro. Note that I'm not asking to virtualize the OS, just using a virtualization program to install the OS in the physical partition and then boot from it as if it were installed normally.   Can anybody help me?   <comment320512> You never said which MacBook you have exactly.  Also what distros have you tried, exactly.  Right now, as this is written, it is quite broad in scope. <comment320514> White MacBook from 2007 (although hardware-wise is the same as the 2006 one). Distos, Either elementary OS or linux Mint
