Notification Center: Sparrow notifications not removed automatically <body> Since upgrading to Mountain Lion, Sparrow (email client) places notifcations in Notification Center.  I'm happy enough with that but when I read the email in Sparrow, the notification remains in Notification Center until I manually remove it which is a pain.  ul liDoes anyone know why? ul liCould it be on the Sparrow side not sending the API call back?/li /ul/li liIs there a feasible work around? /li /ul  <answer64013> You could just use temporary screen pop-ups, and disable the notification center:  You can set this per app.  Apple Menu - System Preferences - Notifications  Then, for Sparrow, choose Banners, not alerts.
