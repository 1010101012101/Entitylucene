Disable alt-tab (option-tab) instead of command-tab <body> I am using Mac OS X 10.8.4 on a Macbook Pro and somehow alt-tab is switching between the applications from Dock. I would like alt-tab to work within RDP (Windows) only.  I don't know how (or if) did I enable that (i do not have KeyRemap4Mac or anything like that).  Is alt(option)-tab supposed to work as default?  Any ideas how I can disable this behaviour?  <answer95547> It sounds like you've managed to change your keyboard mappings.  Assuming you haven't installed 3rd party mapping software, the quickest fix is to restore the mappings back to default.  SystemPreferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts - Keyboard &amp; Text Input - Restore Defaults  Most likely one of the "Move focus to X" options is set to alt-tab  <answer95549> Also check if you don't have both keys swapped in strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard  Modifier Keys/strong.  <comment119926> Yes, thanks! I tried setting "option-tab" to some other shortcut and noticed I had at some point set it to some other obscure action. (sorry for the late reply, I somehow didn't get the StackExchange notifications and had just given up on it :P)
