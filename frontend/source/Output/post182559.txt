Importing Finder Folders to Albums in Photos app <body> I organize all of my photos into folders. I have years of photos organized properly by year_date_event_name. I would like to import the folders directly into the Photos app as Albums named as the folder name.   I can't seem to even find a way to import the folders as albums, let alone having the folder name used as the album name.   I'm guessing a script would be the best way to do this? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   <comment217615> Dragging a folder into iPhoto would create an album with the name of the folder. I don't know if that works anymore. Beware though, dragging more than one won't create folders for each. <comment217619> I tried it and it does not work anymore. <comment220194> Another simple, useful, almost-every-other-app-even-iPhoto-has-it feature they removed/neglected because of god-knows-why :(
