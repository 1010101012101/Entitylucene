Dropbox asking for permissions to wrong folder after changing account name <body> I just got a new macbook and is now installing apps to it. After setting up Dropbox and everything else, I decided that I wanted to change the account name (which was previously "mac") to my name. Everything worked fine, until I tried to open Dropbox, it asked for permission to the wrong user folder (of the old account name) like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AzY2b.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried unlink my computer from Dropbox account and reinstalling Dropbox, the software keeps looking for that folder's permission. What should I do to fix this? Please suggest and thanks.  EDIT:  After I type my login details, this is what I got:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/98mQD.png" alt="enter image description here"   The thing is the folder code/Users/mac/code doesn't exist. I click on the link of the dialog and got this log:     bn.BUILD_KEY: Dropbox bn.VERSION: 2.6.31 bn.DROPBOXEXT_VERSION: failed   bn.is_frozen: True pid: 489 ppid: 233 uid: 501 user_info:   pwd.struct_passwd(pw_name='ichigo', pw_passwd='********', pw_uid=501,   pw_gid=20, pw_gecos='Huong Do', pw_dir='/Users/ichigo',   pw_shell='/bin/bash') effective_user_info:   pwd.struct_passwd(pw_name='ichigo', pw_passwd='********', pw_uid=501,   pw_gid=20, pw_gecos='Huong Do', pw_dir='/Users/ichigo',   pw_shell='/bin/bash') euid: 501 gid: 20 egid: 20 group_info:   grp.struct_group(gr_name='staff', gr_passwd='em', gr_gid=20,   gr_mem=['root']) effective_group_info:   grp.struct_group(gr_name='staff', gr_passwd='/em', gr_gid=20,   gr_mem=['root']) DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH: None cwd:   u'/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources'        real_path=u'/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources'                 mode=040755 uid=501 gid=20        parent   mode=040755 uid=501 gid=20 HOME: u'/Users/ichigo' strongappdata: u'/Users/mac/.dropbox'/strong            strongreal_path=u'/Users/mac/.dropbox'/strong                     not found            parent   not found dropbox_path: u'/Users/mac/Dropbox'                 strongreal_path=u'/Users/mac/Dropbox'/strong                         not found                 parent  not found sys_executable: '/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/python'                   real_path='/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/python'                             mode=0100755    uid=501 gid=20                   parent    mode=040755 uid=501 gid=20 trace.strongfile/strong: '/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/site-packages.zip/dropbox/boot_error.pyc'                   real_path='/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/site-packages.zip/dropbox/boot_error.pyc'                             not found                   parent    not found tempdir: u'/var/folders/l1/f5mv9brd0s5fwx12z2lrp4s40000gn/T'            real_path=u'/private/var/folders/l1/f5mv9brd0s5fwx12z2lrp4s40000gn/T'                     mode=040700 uid=501 gid=20            parent   mode=040755 uid=501 gid=20 Traceback (most recent call last):   File "dropbox/client/main.pyc", line 1818, in main_startupbr   File "dropbox/client/main.pyc", line 1048, in run   File   "dropbox/client/main.pyc", line 492, in startup_low   File   "dropbox/client/main.pyc", line 314, in safe_makedirs   File "os.pyc",   line 150, in makedirs   File "os.pyc", line 157, in makedirs OSError:   [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Users/mac'   Please note the lines I've emphasized with bold text: the wrong path to Dropbox was given.

Her issue similarly popped up when we migrated her to a new Mac and then changed her user account name.  hr  Thanks for writing in. If you're having trouble running Dropbox on your Mac then please try these steps and then restart Dropbox.  strong1./strong Stop Dropbox (If needed):  ul liClick the Dropbox icon in the menu bar at the top of your screen/li liClick on the gear icon in the Notifications panel and select 'Quit Dropbox'/li /ul  strong2./strong Download the newest version: www.dropbox.com/install  strong3./strong Open your Terminal app (Located at /Applications/Utilities/Terminal)  strong4./strong Copy and paste the following lines into the Terminal, ONE AT A TIME, and press ENTER after each one. PLEASE make sure you copy and paste these commands (don't type them by hand), as getting them wrong could cause some harm. You'll be prompted for your computer's admin password (not your Dropbox password) after entering the first command. Keep in mind that the password field in the terminal will remain blank as you type your password. After you type it, just press ENTER.  precodesudo chown "$USER" "$HOME"  sudo chown -R "$USER" ~/Dropbox  sudo chmod -R u+rw ~/Dropbox  sudo mv ~/.dropbox ~/.Trash/dropbox.old  sudo mv ~/.dropbox-master ~/.Trash/dropbox-master.old  sudo chmod -N ~  sudo mv /Library/DropboxHelperTools ~/DropboxHelperTools.old /code/pre  strong5./strong Open the .dmg file from step # 2 and double click the Dropbox icon to install Dropbox.  strong6./strong Restart Dropbox from the Applications folder.  hr  Hopefully that does the trick for you as well!  <answer288721> Uninstall and re-install:  code rm -rf ~/.dropbox/ &amp;&amp; rm -rf /Library/DropboxHelperTools /code  Then run the installer again.  <comment150570> Login with your current Macbook credentials? <comment150571> @Rob I've edited my question, please check it out. <comment150591> I ran into this exact same issue with one of my users two days ago.  Unlinking Dropbox, completely removing Dropbox (from /Library & ~/Library preferences, caches, etc) and reinstalling Dropbox had no effect.  So far Dropbox support hasn't responded to our help ticket.  If they do I'll pass along the info, otherwise I'll be watching this question and would like to add a bounty to it once it's eligible. <comment150613> Really nice timing haha! This totally solves the problem, thanks so much for your time. <comment183141> In my case, all I needed was `mv ~/.dropbox ~/.Trash` and `sudo mv /Library/DropboxHelperTools ~/.Trash`. <comment233183> This was helpful for getting around the Dropbox issue.  However, I found that so many applications had hard-coded the username that the best way forward was to create a new user with the desired username and start over. <comment324695> If you wanted to remove them, then why not simply `rm -rf ~/.dropbox`?
