Setting Keynote default bold weight from 900 to 700 <body> Is it possible to set what is the weight Keynote uses for bold text? I remember in previous Keynote versions I've had setting bold result in weight 500, but in the latest Keynote Sierra version I'm using, the default weight for bold is 900.  I'd like to set bold to font weight 700.  I have changed Character style - Bold to 700 but that does not change the fact that pressing cmd+b makes the text 900.
