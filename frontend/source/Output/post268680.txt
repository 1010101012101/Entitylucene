MacBook abruptly turn off <body> I have a MacBook Model A1278. After a replacement of the battery in a moment of low charge (like 5-7%) the laptop is abruptly shutting down. As far as I remember it should be like a "sleep mode" or something like that.  Additionally, in a process of normal shutting down that I do by myself with any percent of charge, I hear some clicking sounds from the HDD that means that the HDD was turned off incorrectly (in a moment when read head doesn't stop in a parking zone).  For the first try of repair I did reset of PRAM and SMC but it doesn't help. As a result, either PRAM or SMC didn't reset (how I can check it?) or there is something else. Any suggestions?  strongUPDATE:/strong Thank you everyone for attention! So here is more information:  ol liI Have A1278 Mid-2012 model./li liI've using macOS 10.12.2/li liAfter the command codesyslog | grep shutdown/code I've got the result in only one line     NOTE:  Most system logs have moved to a new logging system.

It's not clear exactly what model of MacBook you have, but the process for resetting the SMC can differ. I have included two sets of instructions below that could apply to you - select the one that matches your emBattery/em type.  strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li listrongDisconnect/strong the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer/li liRemove the battery/li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd for 5 seconds and release/li liPut the battery back in/li liReconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button/li /ol  <answer268796> I suspect there is something with the battery: if it is not an original battery, replace it with an original Apple battery, the rest is crap, although Newertech batteries are not too bad. If it is a real Apple battery, you may have used it too harshly (never let it come empty say, charge when 20% or higher): Could you give the Cycle Count and the Battery condition please (Applications-Utilities-SystemInformation-Power, then on the right side you read these) LexS  <comment337398> The A1278 is a 13" MBP that goes from 2009-2013; which one do you ***specifically*** have?  What OS are you using?  What is the shutdown cause in your syslog?   Issue the command `syslog | grep shutdown` and **edit your question** to update it with the new info.  What specifically are you attempting to fix?  The abrupt shutdown or the sleep/hibernation mode? <comment337400> Did you install the battery? One thing to try (if you haven't yet), is to calibrate the battery. Easy to follow instructional videos can be found on sites like Other World Computing. <comment337527> Thank you! I've added some info <comment337528> Thank you! I did excatly the same thing. The reciepts of resetting PRAM and SMD I've got from the Apple Knowledge Database (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295) <comment337535> That error message from `syslog` indicates that you're on 10.12 (Sierra) or later.  This is why it's ***important to include your OS and Mac model when asking questions.***  Try the command `log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "shutdown"' --style syslog --info` <comment337559> I've tried two absolutely different batteries: original and not. Both have the cycle count less than 30. Same problem. <comment337637> @Allan thank you! The logs are available here: http://pastebin.com/bsjiEbME
