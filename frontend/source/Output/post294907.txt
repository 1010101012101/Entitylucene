Smart mailbox for unread messages in Mail.app <body> h1Problem/h1  I've created a smart mailbox in macOS Mail for "Unread" messages with the following rules:     Contains messages that match all of the following conditions:      ul   liMessage is in the mailbox: Inbox/li   liMessage is unread/li   /ul   The smart mailbox will always emcorrectly/em include emunread/em messages in my inbox. But often, it will emincorrectly/em include emread/em messages in my inbox. Any ideas on how I can fix this?  h1Other information and troubleshooting steps so far/h1  ul liCurrently using macOS Sierra 10.12.6/li liEmail account is hosted by Google/li liOther smart mailboxes with other rules still work properly./li liIf I use the filter button in my inbox, Mail will properly perform filtering -- even for unread messages./li liI tried marking the problematic messages as unread and then as read again. Afterwards, the number next to the title of the "Unread" mailbox will decrease (because I have taken steps to mark messages as read), but the "Unread" mailbox itself will still list those messages (even though they are read)./li liI tried the above step from gmail.com. Same result./li liI tried getting new mail. Nothing changes. I tried rebuilding my mailboxes. No rebuilding happens./li liI tried rebooting my computer in safe mode. Then, any smart mailbox I created would contain no messages regardless of the rules I set./li liThere doesn't seem to be any pattern to which messages are problematic./li liMy "Unread" smart mailbox still behaves properly for non-problematic messages even if it contains problematic messages./li liOnce a problematic message appears in my "Unread" smart mailbox, it will stay there for a few days. Then, it will suddenly leave "Unread" and sit in my Inbox where it belongs./li /ul
