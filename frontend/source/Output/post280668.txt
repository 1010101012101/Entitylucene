Repairing Ipad mini 3 wifi <body> My ipad wifi "switch" does not work, even after a complete reinstall. Is this something I could buy a spare part and repair my self?   <answer280676> The wifi 'switch' is in the iOS software, and it is certainly not a discrete physical object that can be replaced.   From the iFixit teardown of this particular iPad, you can see that replacing the wi-fi chip itself is next to impossible to repair or replace. iPad logic boards are replaced in their entirety, and individual modules (like wi-fi chips) cannot be swapped.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K7Hez.png" alt="enter image description here"
