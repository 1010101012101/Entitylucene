How can I see the old episodes of a podcast on iPad? <body> I have noticed that I cannot see all the episodes of a podcast in the feed section, even though I see it on the podcasts website. Can someone tell me how I can access the older episodes ?  I'd like to watch some episodes not being shown on the app but available on the website.  Thanks.  <answer242212> It depends on the author of the podcast. Some authors limit their podcasts on iTunes but do offer them via their website (it gives them extra traffic).   <answer242225> Unfortunately, the podcast feed for this particular show only includes the most recent 30 podcasts. To determine that, I looked at the feed source and counted the number of code&lt;item&gt;/code tags within the code&lt;channel&gt;/code tag.  Unfortunately, there is no way to play shows older than that with a podcast player unless they'd previously been downloaded and saved to your device.  It's true that podcasters often limit this, but normally the limit would be higher â€” 100 is common, for example. Your best bet for a solution is to contact the show (or the BBC, if direct show feedback isn't possible) and ask them to set the limit high enough that all podcast episodes are available.  <comment297860> What kind of podcast where you going to watch / listen? <comment297861> Ones about Science. I'm talking about Frontiers in particular here. It's run by BBC <comment297862> Is there no way to listen to it rough the app ? It's not organised otherwise. <comment297864> I am seeing the same content (30 podcasts) on the [official bbc](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qy5p/episodes/downloads) website and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/podcast/frontiers/id577389804?mt=2) ? <comment297869> @rwzdoorn But, in this link http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qy5p/episodes/player there are 120 episodes. <comment297901> What can I do for other podcasts like the Nature podcast? Also, can you tell me how you checked tags? <comment297955> @rwzdoorn There's also a show called Science Friday which only allows access to it's last 10 episodes through the app. How can I get the older episodes? <comment298034> _"What can I do for other podcasts like the Nature podcast?"_ I couldn't find an RSS/podcast link on the show's page or on iTunes. It appears that this show (last broadcast in 2014?) isn't available as a podcast. <comment298035> _"Also, can you tell me how you checked tags?"_ From the [podcast tab of the Frontiers show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qy5p/episodes/downloads), clicked the **Subscribe** button and selected **RSS**, then selected View  Developer  View Source in my browser. I cleaned up the source XML using a text editor (Atom) and then counted the number of `item` tags.
