Is a person notified when their location is being tracked? <body> If I log in using someone else's Apple ID and their email address to track their iPhone, will they be notified by email?  <answer196361> No, a user is not outright alerted that Find My iPhone is being used to track their device's current location. There are certain things that can trigger a warning, though:  ul liIf you lock the phone/send it a message, they would know/li liYou could check location services to see if the service had used GPS recently, although that wouldn't tell you that it was specifically from Find My Iphone triggered by you/li liIf the user has new login notifications turned on, they may be alerted that there was a login from a new browser/li /ul  <comment234559> What you are describing is almost certainly illegal.
