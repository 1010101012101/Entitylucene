App on iPhone shows installed but can't find it to open or uninstall <body> I have a weird behavior with one of the apps on my iPhone. As you may see on the picture it's not installed but at the same time I can't seem to uninstall it because I can't find it on my iPhone, neither on the screens neither through search. Does anyone have an idea how to solve this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vE1av.png" width="320"  <answer294604> It's an iMessage app.   How to delete an iMessage app:  ol liTap the App Store icon in the iMessage conversation view/li liTap the apps icon on the bottom left (4 rounded grey rectangles)/li liLong-tap the app you want to delete (they’ll start wiggling)/li liDelete just like you’d delete any app on your phone/li liDone/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AdwqL.png" width="320" alt="Delete iMessage app"  <comment371843> You talking about "Checkmate!" ? <comment371844> @pjctech Yes, that one is giving me a headache <comment371849> Wow.
