How can I skip the Trash when deleting a file? <body> I frequently connect different external USB hard drives and flash drives to my computer and I would like to facilitate deleting files and regaining disk space from them.  If I simply delete the file, it will be kept in a hidden trash folder on the external drive until I empty the Trash. This also forces me to empty my local trash simultaneously while the external disk is still connected to regain the disk space, which is undesirable.  At the moment, the only other "solution" I've found is moving the file to the internal hard drive and then trash it. This is not optimal because I waste time moving files from one drive to another (I regularly deal with 20GB+ VMs).  strongHow can I permanently delete a file from an external drive, bypassing the trash?/strong  <answer66371> And option could be Terminal command coderm/code, with the code-P/code option if you want some added security:     [Option strong-P/strong will]    Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.   To do so, just:  ol liOpen the strongTerminal.app/strong (Found in /Applications/Utilities)./li liType coderm -P/code  and drag the file to the terminal window. Then hit kbdEnter/kbd./li /ol  <answer66372> Have you consider to use Trash Without from the Mac App Store?  <answer66374> Background information can be found in the paper Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory  An implementation of the knowledge gained from this paper is GNU shred. This tool can be installed as part of codecoreutils/code from MacPorts.  <answer66375> How about something like Trash X. The description says:     You can use it to instantly delete or shred file and folders without   sending them to the trash. You can use it to empty or shred trash only   on selected disks. And of course, you can use it just like the   trashcan you've always had on your desktop.   <answer66379> You can create an Automator service or application to facilitate executing the coderm/code shell commando, which will permanently delete files or folders and skip the trash.  For example, start with creating a new Service in strongAutomator.app/strong.  ul liSelect codefiles or folders/code as input, you probably also want to limit the availability of this service to the Finder app./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fYhEV.png" alt="Automator service input"  ul liOptionally, but highly recommended, first add an codeAsk for Confirmation/code step to the workflow./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQ6Kk.png" alt="Confirmation step"  ul liFinally, add the codeRun Shell Script/code step to the workflow. Make sure to pass input codeas arguments/code. Then you can put in the following script:  precodefor f in "$@" do     rm -rf "$f" done /code/pre/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jX6JP.png" alt="Input shell script"  As mentioned by @Thecafremo, you can also add a code-P/code parameter to coderm/code for additional security while deleting. For an extra nicety, you can add some audible feedback by adding the following command at the end of the shell script:  precodeafplay "/System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/finder/empty trash.aif" /code/pre  Save your service, and it should be ready to use in Finder from the Services menu in the menu bar. The service will also appear at the bottom of the menu you get by right clicking on files in Finder, although to make it appear there you may have to run it once from the codeFinder &gt; Services/code menu first.  You can also configure a keyboard shortcut to your service in the Keyboard preference pane of System Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P76SF.png" alt="Services menu"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AmTn6.png" alt="Service in action"  Instead of creating a service, you could similarly create an application in Automator, which you can pin in the Dock so you can drag files to it.  <answer96851> There is a strongfree/strong tool called emSkip The Trash/em, which not only allows regular deletion, but authenticated deletion as an admin. It adds context menus to the Finder:  http://www.blazingtools.com/delete_without_trash_mac.html  <answer242961> As of El Capitan 10.11.6 this is now possible without using Terminal.app: select the files you want rid of, right click and pick "Delete Immediatelyâ€¦".  <answer242976> codeAlt+Cmd+Backspace/code will permanently delete files, with a confirmation dialog warning that this action can not be undone. codeCmd+Backspace/code simply moves files to Trash, without confirmation.  Tip: whenever you want Mac app to do the same action but a little differently, try doing it with codeAlt/code button pressed.  <answer243101> The following trick works with OS X El Capitan. I got the tip from here.  Select your file(s) in Finder. Go to the codeFile/code menu, and when you press the codealt/option/code key, you will see the "Move to Trash" option change to "Delete Immediately...".  <comment78077> Woah, dragging the folder will delete the whole folder, right? <comment78078> @duci9y Right! I'll edit the answer to correct it. Answering without proofreading is not the best thing to do, indeed. <comment78080> This looks decent, but I was wondering if there's anything freely available. <comment78087> That's true :-) But at least it is cheap. <comment78092> Why the downvote? Who doesn't like MacPorts or GNU tools? <comment78093> You can also remove a folder if you use the option `-rf`. <comment78094> This is for sure the most elegant solution. And it's free :-) <comment78101> It is very difficult to erase permanently something from a flash based USB drive. Further reading: http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5662/is-it-enough-to-only-wipe-a-flash-drive-once <comment78104> @Andris Thanks, interesting link. I think I framed my question badly. I'm not interested in a secure deletion. I'm simply interested in deleting a file and regaining the space. <comment78159> I wasn't the person to down vote, but I don't feel that this answers the question. Perhaps the original is worded badly <comment78164> This is really nice. Thanks for a great solution :) <comment78552> So, you can't empty trash locally when the file is external, but you can when it's stored internally? Why on earth keep anything in trash anywhere when you are one step away from deleting it? I don't get the justification added. Why not edit that out and just say you want to do X? <comment78563> @bmike because I don't mind having a trash locally. I DO mind having a trash on a more limited flash drive. Essentially, deleting a file does not free up space on the drive. I know this is the same for local disks, but it's more acceptable to me. This addresses a specific use case. <comment141289> This isn't working for me in Mavericks... It just doesn't do anything when I use the service. <comment148017> Great answer, but consider improving it by making it prompt for password if and when superuser privilege is necessary for a deletion. <comment167543> I would like to add that this service can even be used to delete files that are already in the trash--something that is otherwise very difficult. (Awesome!) <comment168899> sudo rm -rf followed by space works wonders, thanks! <comment180450> The Accepted Solution above is good if you have to do this frequently, but I just had one file I needed to nuke (from orbit) and this does the trick. <comment208745> It is incredible that Apple don't see what a problem this is. How on earth is a normal user supposed to understand what is going on? From their point of view their USB drive is empty but useless! <comment212207> Bravo and +1 for this answer. I also assigned it a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences. I **wanted** Opt+Del but the delete key was not assignable. I went the `Cmd+Opt+Ctrl+\ `. I have a 101 Apple keyboard and long thumbs! <comment233492> Awesome! Couple of things. Clicking on the icon inside Ask for Confirmation step will change it to an yellow exclamation sign - handy to warn that what you're about to do is dangerous. When saving, the name entered should be "Permanently Delete" as this is what will be shown in the Services menu. Sadly this doesn't support `sudo` when password is required. I tried using `osascript -e ... with administrator priveleges` but escaping the original `"` with `\"` didn't seem to work. <comment233537> **Problem:** If I select one single folder, the Services menu shows "No services apply". I can only see the service when I select two or more folders, a file or a mixture of files, folders or both. Why is that, and what is the solution? <comment262993> Just tried to replicate this in El Capitan. It played back the sound file but didn't actually delete the file itself. Couldn't identify anything I left out, though admittedly I'm not very familiar with Automator. <comment299345> Thanks! This is now the accepted answer. For the benefit of others, it might be helpful to note in your answer that Alt is called Option on US-layout keyboard.
