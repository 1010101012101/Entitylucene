Free RSS reader client for Mac with new post notification? <body> Is there any free RSS reader client for Mac that can give me a notification if there are new posts to read?  <answer9127> If I understand your question correctly, NetNewsWire does this.  It's free, but ad-supported; you can pay extra to remove the ads.  <answer9128> Use codeMail.app/code and set it up as a filter in codeMail Preferences-&gt;RSS/code.  <answer9129> Vienna.  <answer9131> Or you can use Google Chrome and the Google Reader Notifier.  Hopefully Google will build this in reader in the next update. Google Mail already has this build in.  <answer9132> Though it will eventually be a paid app in the Mac App Store, the Reeder beta is currently free. It's a very well-designed, highly polished app that's actually gotten me back into reading RSS feeds:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJvy3.jpg" alt=""  If you need a notification for new posts to read, you can configure Reeder to display a count of unread RSS items in the dock:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FYi5r.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer9150> NewsFire has Growl integration.  <comment9647> Its a good RSS reader but It automatically refresh only after 30 mins... I need a reader that can refresh after 5 mins
