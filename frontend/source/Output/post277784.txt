Sound output device vanished <body> This is the weirdest thing. I have an MBP 9,2 (10.12.3). I detached my headphones, closed the lid and then opened it again after 1h or so. Now I cannot change the system volume, here's what I see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LZhEA.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I thought maybe this is the old problem where the computer does not realise the headphones have been plugged out, but inserting and detaching them again does not help. However, the red light inside the port is on, as in the case of the aforementioned bug. The strange part is that in the Sound Preferences, I now see this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSQDR.png" alt="enter image description here"  there used to be an item codeInternal Speakers/code and clearly, the laptop doesn't have optical sound output.  Can anyone suggest what the cause and fix might be?  strongWhat I've tried:/strong  ul liRebooting (didn't help)/li /ul  <answer277785> Strangely, rebooting does nothing, but inserting and detaching the headphones multiple times has fixed the problem.  <answer277812> You may be able to troubleshoot this by opening "Audio MIDI Setup" from code/Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup.app/code, then you should be able to add devices from this location. I suspect that somehow, the Built In Output is removed from the list, and the little + sign in the bottom corner may be able to add the support for the device again.
