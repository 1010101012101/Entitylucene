After typing sudo I can no longer autocomplete commands by pressing Tab <body> In a Terminal, if I type beginning of any command by pressing tab I can see the rest of that command.  However this feature does not work with any words I type after codesudo/code.  How can I complete command names even after I write codesudo/code?  <answer82290> It would help to know what shell you are using. This works for me in both bash and zsh. The completion in zsh is much better than bash.   One thing you could do is to type the command you want using tab completion, but before hitting return type codecontrol-a/code to go to the beginning of the line and then type codesudo/code and hit return to execute the command.  <answer82297> I did fix my problem by installing Bash Completion on Macports.   <answer82568> OS X has not turned ON as many completion possibilities at the guys behind Ubuntu. In order to add autocompletion to sudo, you should simply add to the file code$HOME/.bash_profile/code  precodecomplete -cf sudo /code/pre  The description of codecomplete/code and its options is briefly defined in the codebash/code built-in commands manual page (see codeman bash/code). Although the -c and -f commands are not obviously detailed, one can find their description under the "-A action" explanation.  <comment94965> One way would be to write the command first, followed by Ctrl-A to jump to the beginning of the line and then type `sudo`. <comment94968> I checked terminal - preferences it says Login Shell. I think I'm not using any special shell.  actually I wrote /bin/bash and /bin/zsh none of them helped to fix my problem. <comment94970> Do what I recommend in the second paragraph of my answer. That is best. <comment94971> yeah but I wanna use it like as I always did in ubuntu is there any other way to do that ?
