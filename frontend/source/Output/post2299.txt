How are images stored on the hard drive of an iPhone? <body> If I were to examine my iPhone's hard drive, in what format would I find the images in the Photos app stored?  Are they in a big code.sqlite/code database file? Or are they stored as individual files such as code.jpg/code?  I'm looking for the extension used (e.g. code.sqlite/code, code.png/code, code.jgp/code, etc.).  <answer2301> All the images are stored as jpegs in various locations. The camera roll, for example, is stored in /private/var/mobile/Media/ (unless they've moved it).
