Applescript (or other Quicksilver accessible thing) for hibernating a snow leopard mac? <body> Anyone have a quick way, accessible from Quicksilver, to force your mac to hibernate?  <answer10700> You can use strongDeep Sleep/strong. It's a Dashboard widget that will put your mac into hibernation mode.  strongEdit/strong: from the website     Deep Sleep can also be used as a command line utility   From there, you can check out if QuickSilver can launch command line programs.br You can also package it in a code.app/code -for example using Automator- and launch it with QuickSilver.  ~~  strongCareful/strong, be aware there's 2 sleep mode.  The normal one you can trigger using kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdEject/kbd  And the hibernate (or Safe Sleep) mode.  You can read about the differences between them here.  <answer10704> Install SleepNow and then run that from QuickSilver.  <comment11238> SleepNow just puts the computer to sleep. That option is available by default in Quicksilver's Extra Scripts plug-in. The original poster asked for a script to force hibernation. <comment11255> Thanks for the pointer! I've been using that widget for awhile now. What I'm looking for is something that I can access via Quicksilver. <comment11259> @Tim I added a solution for Quicksilver <comment11265> Instead of Quicksilver, why dont you try [Alfred.app](http://www.alfredapp.com)? It provides basic system commands such as sleep, trash, logout etc, you can customize it pretty easily and its full of nifty features! <comment11330> Shame on me for not noticing. :)
