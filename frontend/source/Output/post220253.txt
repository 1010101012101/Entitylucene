Keyboard's light is not working <body> When I press the F5/F6 button, the HUD shows a decreasing/increasing bar related to the keyboard's brightness (image).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hJ9q9.png" alt=""  So far so goodâ€¦ The problem is: the keyboard stays completely dark, no light is emitted from the keyboard, even though the bar is moving when I press the keys F5 and F6.   I've already tried to reset PRAM and SMC but it didn't fix my problem. What should I do?  <answer220256> If you go to Keyboard in System Preferences, there is a check box titled "Adjust keyboard brightness in low light".  If that is turned off, does your problem still present itself?  <comment266575> Image is in a private area. Post to somewhere like imgur, flikr & paste the link here; then someone with the necessary reputation can inline it for you <comment266576> @Tetsujin done! <comment266664> @PauloWaldo yes, it does. I`ve already tried both opitions but no nothing changed =/
