Flashing question mark, low hard drive space <body> When I booted my Mac last night I got a flashing folder against a gray background. The computer started fine this morning, but when I closed the lid and opened it up again I had to reboot, and now it's persistently in this flashing folder state.  Booting while holding down kbdâŒ˜ Cmd/kbd-kbdR/kbd brings me to OS X Utilities. Running "Repair disk" from disk utilities indicates there's no problem, but I did notice that it also says I only have 16 MB free on a 110GB hard drive.   Might this be the problem? If so, is there some way to delete data from my computer while in this state, to clear enough space to boot correctly?  <answer173825> strongThough the following should be valid for non-encrypted volumes and unlocked encrypted volumes, it doesn't help much because the main volume here is encrypted and locked. So skip to FileVault2-encrypted volumes/strong  strongNon-encrypted volumes/strong  Almost no free space on your start volume is a problem. At least 10% free space are recommended.  It's indeed possible to remove files &amp; folder in Recovery Mode but if you have an external disk/thumb drive (hfs+ or fat32-formatted) you may move them instead:  ul liattach your external device (if you have one)./li liIf FileVault2 is enabled on your main volume start Disk Utility, right click the volume and unlock it/li liQuit Disk Utility and open /Utilities/Terminal in the menubar/li lienter codecd /Volumes/NameOfYourMainVolume/Users/accountname/code to change to your user folder (example: codecd "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/ausername"/code).

That's unallocated free space on your hard drive.

The only possible solution then is completely erase/repartition the hard drive and restore a backup./li /ul  <comment204560> How long ago is your last backup and can you afford to delete some files or applications to then reinstall them again? (For instance, you could reinstall Word or iMovie or GarageBand easily and not lose your data or settings) <comment204561> I would delete something in /Applications unless you have some large files you can download again (torrents?) or media you can rip from CD again. Also, if the OP has a backup, then anything can be removed safely... <comment204562> Thanks, that's greatly appreciated (and nice touch incorporating my username!). Though I am a Mac novice (as is probably obvious), I'm actually very comfortable with the command line. But I'm still having problems. I used Internet Recovery, and when I open the terminal as you instruct, the only folder in /Volumes is 'Mac OS X Base System', which includes 'Install OS X Mountain Lion.app' and 'usr' but not 'Users' (and the find command shows no 'Users' directory exists), so it seems like my actual hard drive volume isn't accessible from here. <comment204590> The output of `diskutil list` shows `/dev/disk0s2` is the Apple_HFS Mac OS X Base System (1.2GB), and includes the output      `0: FDisk_partition_scheme *120.0 GB disk12     1: 0xEE 120.0 GB disk12s1`  But the mount command seems to fail: running `diskutil mount -mountPoint /Volumes/myhd /dev/disk12s1` gives the error:  `Volume on disk12s1 failed to mount`  If it's relevant, my hard drive is encrypted. Am I doing something obviously wrong? <comment204602> @ausername But now i really doubt that low disk space causes the question mark: Enabling FileVault on your main volume always leaves some *unallocated space* in the MByte range on your main drive. Maybe your FileVault got corrupted. I think we have to start from scratch.
