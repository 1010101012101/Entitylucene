Application to record each individual action in contact list <body> I would like to record each good thing someone in my contactlist or maybe not in my contact list did to me or record a happy time we did togethers. So i can read all the happy memories. See the list when i get angry at someone who might ever did a lot of good thIngs to me or send this list to them at the approprite time. I saw that there is a note section in my contact list. But i wonder Is there any apps that are more suit than this like organize by date and Save Photo.  <answer50172> emBento/em from Filemaker is an easy-to-use database application that leverages and integrates with Core Dataâ€”the storage bins for emAddress Book/em and emCalendar/em. You could roll your own solution or use/modify an existing emPersonal Journal/em template.  <comment57499> Are you looking for OS X (desktop) software, or iOS (iPhone/iPad) software? <comment57561> iphone 4s, ios5
