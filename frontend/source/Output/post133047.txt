activity monitor â€“ "0 bytes" swap used always reported <body> Whenever my system gets slow, I open Activity Monitor to check my RAM usage and close any apps that are consuming a lot of memory, but that I don't absolutely need to be running. RAM usage is always completely maxed out. I'm used to seeing this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IFbOL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now I would assume that when the system gets slow, it's from all of the overhead from VM paging, but Activity Monitor always reports my "Swap Used" as "0 bytes". This can't be the case, could it? The only reason I can imagine is if Mavericks introduced some kind of intermediary solution to RAM exhaustion before falling back to using a swapfile, but I haven't heard of anything like that.  What I want to know is:  ol liIs this actually an error in Activity Monitor, or is it correct?/li liIf it's not an error, what mechanism is being used to maintain the RAM in place of the swapfile?/li liIs this mechanism verifiably faster than using a swapfile, and is there a way to disable it and use the swapfile by default?/li /ol  <answer133051> ol liIs this actually an error in Activity Monitor, or is it correct?  ul liThat is how it suppose to work/li /ul/li liIf it's not an error, what mechanism is being used to maintain the RAM in place of the swapfile?  ul liMavericks active memory management/li /ul/li liIs this mechanism verifiable faster than using a swapfile, and is there a way to disable it and use the swapfile by default?  ul liit is faster then using actual swap to HDD, it also uses something called memory compression. It always tries to use all of the memory to handle its tasks, and will rearrange the memory according to your usage. Once that is no longer possible it will use the swap./li /ul/li /ol  <comment157745> Very interesting. Never would have expected that live compression/decompression would be faster than using a swapfile, but that's why I'm an app developer and not an operating system architect. In any case, it's time to buy more RAM.
