How can I buy Yosemite apps from a Mavericks installation? <body> I am trying to buy an app which runs on 10.10 only, from a computer that has 10.9 installed. The App Store does not like it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CAW8e.png" alt="mac app store screenshot"  emTranslation: Your purchase could not be completed. OmniOutliner could not be installed […], as it requires […] 10.10 or newer/em  In other words: I would like to just strongperform the buying process/strong, strongnot install/strong the application on my computer (Which is not compatible – yet. Long story). Any help is greatly appreciated.  Nota bene: I can not buy from Omnigroup directly, or use a gift card. Another long story.   <answer190932> I know this is a fringe case. I can report that as of Summer of 2015, buying an app for a newer OS version from an older version is not possible. strongI solved the issue/strong by installing 10.10 on a different partition, and bought the app from there.   <comment224399> If you are trying to purchase this for another person's Yosemite Mac, how about purchasing an Apple Store gift card? <comment224413> Did you consider buying it from their site (https://store.omnigroup.com), instead of the App Store? <comment224495> This *may* be one of those situations where "momma knows best." Where momma is Apple and won't let you do such a thing because it's not compatible. And I am unsure that you can then copy the app to another Mac, there may be some sort of copy protection/DRM to prevent copying to another Mac. <comment226752> Why don't you upgrade to Yosemite on your main partition? Maverick is becoming out of date and soon El Captain will be out soon. This will make Mavericks 2 years old! When El Captain comes out new apps may not be supported on OS X 10.9 (or even 10.10!) due to swift 2 released with El Captain. This will make apps more efficient and more powerful (with metal)
