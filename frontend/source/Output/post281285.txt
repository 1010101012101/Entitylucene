Boot Camp partition has disappeared when trying to reformat <body> I tried to install Windows 10 on my iMac Fusion Drive. Windows installation was not successful and I tried to reformat the Boot Camp partition and create a single OS partition via Disk Utility. However, I received an error message saying that the partition could not be reformatted.  The Boot Camp partition has now completely disappeared â€” it's not seen in Disk Utility or anywhere. Trying to reinstall Sierra shows only the macOS partition, not the entire disk, and likewise the attempt to reformat the drive.  Anyone have any ideas as to how to get access to the entire drive again?  <comment353907> There's dozens of questions & answers here about bootcamp partition failure.
