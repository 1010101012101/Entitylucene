Debian install on MacBook7.1 <body> My goal is to install Debian 'jessie' on my second disk that I installed to replace my MBP's DVD drive.  I've completed the installation of 'jessie' and on powerup my MBP loads grub2 to boot up Debian. Which means I can only boot into macOS by pressing ⌥ on startup.  I would like to have it do the excact opposite. So that macOS is my primary startup disk. But when I go to my System Preferences in macOS and try to change the Startup Disk it only displays the macOS disk. I think this is because of my two disk setup on which I have two separate EFI partiotions for both OS.  So when I change my Startup Disk in System Preferences macOS boots up fine. But Debian which is labeled 'Windows' under my ⌥ bootup options shows 'Missing Operation System'  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         127.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI NO NAME                 536.9 MB   disk1s1    2: 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4               111.2 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Linux Swap                         8.3 GB     disk1s3 /code/pre  So how should I 'bless' the grub2 EFI bootloader under my macOS EFI partition or can they happily live apart? I would prefer a solution without rEFInd.
