Why does Adobe Reader require an installer? <body> Does anyone know why Adobe Reader requires a permissioned installer application, rather that simply existing as a self contained macOS application bundle?  What system level configurations is the installer making changes to, and why does Adobe feel they are needed for a simple PDF reader?  <answer255884> The Acrobat Reader installer not only installs the application itself into code/Applications/code but contains a bunch of other packages which need to get installed into other places (e.g. browser plugins). These things can't get installed by just using a simple application bundle (at least not as easily).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kgcy0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment318842> At the very least it registers the [auto-update service](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99865/how-is-adobe-update-notifier-auto-launched-on-mac-os-x/99866#99866). As far as "why," nobody but Adobe can answer that. <comment318942> It would be nice if homebrew (or some other package manager) could script the installer to just extract the reader and ignore the plugins and the updater. <comment319292> @patrix By the way - which program did you use to inspect the package? It sound very useful. <comment319293> @Rainer The application is called Pacifist <comment319393> I've used Pacifist before to extract components and drivers from old OSX images. It's pretty great.
