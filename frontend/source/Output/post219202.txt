How can I create bash_profile and bashrc <body> OS X 10.11.2 El Capitan  I want to create some alias, so I go to code~//code folder and there is no code.bash_profile/code or code.bashrc/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mt1rm.png" alt="ls -a ~/"  I have been looking for some info and I learn that code.bash_profile/code is only read when bash launch an interactive login shell (default type of terminal in OS X) and code.bashrc/code is only read when bash launch an interactive non-login shell. But I don't find how to create code.bash_profile/code and code.bashrc/code for my user. How can I do it?  After @klanomath answer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ua7Ev.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer219206> Open Terminal and enter:  precodetouch ~/.bash_profile touch ~/.bashrc /code/pre  To edit the file(s) use:  precodenano ~/.bash_profile nano ~/.bashrc /code/pre  Instead of nano you can use any decent text editor (e.g. BBEdit, TextWrangler).  To immediately enable any changes in the file .bash_profile use codesource/code:  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  <comment265131> I already try that but didn't work :(  Please, look the new photo that I attach to the question. Thanks for the help. <comment265132> I try `source  ~/.bash_profile` …didn't work. <comment265133> @raaowx the correct expression is `alias lsa='ls -a | egrep "\.[a-zA-Z0-9]"'`instead of `alias lsa='ls -a | egrep '\.[a-zA-Z0-9]'`! The inner `'` are wrong and you are missing one finishing `'` <comment265134> +1 ¡WORKS! Thank you @klanomath <comment265149> You may want to create a `.bashrc` that contains:- `[ -r ~/.bash_profile ] && source ~/.bash_profile` so that all shells will share the same settings.
