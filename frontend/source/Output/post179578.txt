Changing one Preview annotation changes another <body> Every year when I go to do my taxes, I use the Annotate feature in Preview to quickly fill in my forms. I like to drag all of my forms into one document via the thumbnail view.  Unfortunately, it seems like inevitably I'll fill in a box on one page and find that this annotation (for no apparent reason) corresponds to a totally different box on a different page. For example, I fill in "Boxes checked on 6a and 6b" and "Add numbers on lines above" with "2," and then notice on Schedule A that lines 12 and 14 have had their cents column changed to 2 each as well. Changing these on Schedule A changes the contents of the first two on my first page.  Why does Preview link these annotations together arbitrarily? Is there a workaround, other than to insert my own text boxes?  It was frustrating in earlier versions of Mac OS X, but it seems to be much worse in Yosemite. I'm surprised I can't find references to this happening to other people elsewhere on the web.
