Lost/blocked my credit card, can't buy any apps because of billing info <body> I lost (and locked) my credit card. Now whenever I want to buy an app from the iOS store, the transaction fails. What can I do to prevent this?  <answer182474> From iTunes on your Mac: click on user icon on the top bar ()  Account informations - type your password - billing information then remove your old card and insert your new card.  From iPhone: App Store - scroll bottom - Apple ID: your mail - Show Apple ID type your password - billing information then remove your old card and insert your new card.  <comment217247> what do you want us to do or to tell you ? get a new valid credit card and enter it in to your Apple account.
