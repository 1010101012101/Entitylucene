How to setup two OS X boot partitions plus Bootcamp and Data? <body> Is it possible to set up he following combination of partitions; how?  ul litwo OS X partitions, each bootable (one for the main system, another for testing new OS X releases)/li lia Bootcamp bootable partition for Windows 7/li lidata partition shared between OS X and Windows?/li /ul  I don't need access to either of OS X boot partitions from Windows. And vice versa: don't need to access Windows boot partition from OS X.  I use MacBook Pro 13" 2010, Windows 7 64-bit, OS X Mountain Lion.  <answer175963> Windows 7 and previous has a limitation of being on a drive with no more than 4 partitions. When BootCamp partitions a Mac HD and adds the Windows (NTFS) partition that makes the fourth partition, so if you add more after that Windows will likely become unbootable.  Your plan has a total of 6 partitions, two of them hidden (and rather small) a boot partition and the system repair (bootable) partition. So it stronglooks/strong like you only have four. If you go into Disk utility you can see the other ones (may have to turn on debug mode to see them tho, don't remember...)  You may have to add a HD to the system to do what you want.  Note this info  strongmay/strong have changed with Windows 8, I'm not sure.  <answer175976> It should be possible to partition the HDD like that but not in a default setup with Boot Camp and Windows 8/8.1 is recommended:  The hybrid MBR/GPT necessary for Boot Camp Assistant to install/boot Windows doesn't allow more than 4 partitions:  ul liApple CoreStorage or Macintosh HD/li liRecovery HD/li liyour future Windows 8/(7)/li lia place holder in the MBR linking to the GPT (some count the EFI-partition as the fourth one, but this doesn't seem to be true)/li /ul  So a different approach is necessary:  Skip the hybrid MBR and use a pure GPT setup. Alternatively a multistage boot loader setup with rEFInd may also be possible.  Here is an obviously working setup for Windows 8 (source):  Check the comments there before proceeding.  Windows 7 may work as well with this guide. Here is an opposing point of view which claims that it is impossible to install Windows 7 in native UEFI-mode.  strongWarning: These steps require you to completely  erase your hard drive!

You have to format the volumes afterwards with Disk Utility.  <answer179074> The answer is YES. My mid 2007 iMac is currently configured in such a fashion. My Windows 8.1 uses a BIOS boot. I have two NTFS partitions, one exFAT partition and two HFS+ partitions. (I also have the hidden EFI partition and the hidden OS X recovery partition) The exFAT partition is read/writeable from all operating systems.    Do you need to keep your current Windows and/or OS X operating system partitions? Or, will you be starting from scratch and erasing everything? If you need to preserve your existing windows system then I would recommend using WinClone (cost $30) to move the operating system (preferably) off computer to external storage temporarily. OS X can be backed up and move off computer using the disk utility.   To complete the install, you will probably need to boot from a flash drive containing a copy of the hidden recovery partition. Do you still have your hidden internal recovery partition and does it work? (Better yet if you have already made a flash drive copy) If you don't know the answer, then reboot your computer, then hold down the alt/option key and see if the recovery partition appears.  I assume you have installed windows 7 on the mac before. If not, then do you know if you get "Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install described here? If you do, then you will need to make a new install DVD.  To get things to work, the idea is to do everything opposite of what apple tell you to do. I would recommend the following steps (assuming the internal disk can be erased and you are saving nothing.)  ol liBoot from the flash drive./li liCreate a new GPT partitioned disk using the Disk Utility. The first partition will be for Windows 7, so format it "MS-DOS (FAT)". The second partition will be ExFAT formatted. The third and fourth partitions will be for OS X so choose "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)"./li liExit the Disk Utility and select install OS X from the internet./li liBoot to the installed OS X. Open a Terminal window and enter the command:  codesudo  bless  --device  /dev/disk0s2  --setBoot  --legacy/code/li liInsert the Windows 7 DVD and reboot the computer. Hold down the alt/option key and select the DVD to boot from. Hit the space bar when prompted to continue booting from the DVD. (You only do this once.)/li liInstall Windows 7. Make sure you install to the correct partition and format the partition NTFS./li liInstall bootcamp drivers stored on a MBR partitioned, FAT formatted flash drive. The drivers can be downloaded under OS X from here. I suppose the drivers could also be copied to and installed from the exFAT partition./li liEnjoy hours of installing hundreds and hundreds of updates./li /ol  Of course, I have left out many details, but most of the time no one responds. After I while, I learn not to spend to much time on an answer, unless someone shows interest.  h2Update/h2  I no longer use ExFat formatted internal partitions. I found ExFat to be unreliable. I now use MS-DOS(Fat).  <answer204636> I used to believe that I solved the problem, but my solution only lasted a few months. For the record, here it is, in a nutshell:  ul licreate as many OS X partitions as required; Bootcamp partition and shared FAT32 data partition--all under OS X/li linow use gdisk from gptfdisk (as detailed in this post) to create MBR containing only Bootcamp, Shared and one of the OS X partitions chosen (so effectively MBR becomes a subset of GPT limited to only 3 partitions)/li /ul  This setup lasted a few months until the shared partition became corrupted. Looks like it happened after a minor software update under one of OS X instances, which, in my belief, didn't involve recover partition--but I may be wrong.  Now I'm looking for a best way to recover that shared partition--see a separate question on that.  <comment207778> Thanks. So talking about Windows 7 x64 (which the original question is all about), what about *"Windows 7 x64 (64-bit) only supports installation on a UEFI 2.0 firmware using a GPT partitioned disk"* vs *"Apple Macintoshes implement the EFI 1.1 standard"* problem? <comment207779> @yurkennis At the Moment i don't have the means to test it with a real Mac. If I were you I would just give it a try with a regular Windows 7 x64 DVD. There is a chance that it will work since both Davids use different approaches to get things done. <comment212441> Are you sure the entire process will work for Windows 7, on a MacBook Air mid-2011? <comment212454> No, I am not sure. I do not own a  MacBook Air mid-2011. If I did, there still could be a chance the hardware would be difference from your model. My current inventory of Macs is the iMac 2006, 2007 and 2011 models. Have you changed computers? Your original question referred to a  MacBook Pro 13" 2010. If you answer my questions, I can edit my answer and add more details on how to proceed. <comment212466> @yurkennis: Do you actually have a question? I noticed of the 26 questions you have asked, you answered 16 of them. Of the 16, you gave yourself credit for the correct answer on 14 of the questions. You have only given someone else credit of a correct answer once. I guess this is permitted. I know I have asked/answered/credited my own questions. –  David Anderson 4 hours ago <comment246691> Ooops, I meant 13" MBP late-2010 of course. <comment249069> I will likely try to follow this howto, so there are few questions to ask: <comment249070> "Do you need to keep your current Windows and/or OS X operating system partitions?" - let's assume "from the scratch". <comment249071> "Do you still have your hidden internal recovery partition and does it work?": In addition to SSD that I'm trying to configure this way, I have an HDD with MtLion OS X Recovery which works fine. <comment249075> If working from scratch, then when installing OS X the recovery partitions will be created. I believe during installation the selected partition will shrink in size to make room for the recovery partition. I assume you will not be using core storage. I have avoided core storage because for me there was no advantage to using it. BTW, I updated my answer with respect to EXFAT partitions. Yes, my hidden recovery partition still works. <comment249078> You have an internal SSD and an internal HDD in the same Mac? If so, which is `disk0`?. Which disk(s) are going to have which the operation systems? Do you still have a working internal or external optical drive to read the Windows DVD's? <comment249093> "I assume you will not be using core storage"--never heard about it. Should I? Does "not using it" requires some steps to do so? <comment249096> "You have an internal SSD and an internal HDD in the same Mac?" -- yes, HDD is in optibay in place of optical drive. "If so, which is disk0?" -- SSD. "Which disk(s) are going to have which the operation systems?" -- will install both OS X and Windows to SSD; will use HDD only as a volume for user data which doesn't need speed. "Do you still have a working internal or external optical drive to read the Windows DVD's?" -- currently in an external USB enclosure, but I believe I'll need to put it back into MBP in order to install Windows. Will see, don't remember exactly now. <comment249098> "I no longer use ExFat formatted internal partitions. I found ExFat to be unreliable." -- Thanks for update! I had the same experience with ExFAT previously. <comment249277> Unless you need encryption, I would not use core storage.  So if you are asked during OS X installation, answer No. Hopefully you can install Windows using your external DVD drive. If not, you can still install Widows as a dual boot, but this requires installing VirtualBox to transfer the Windows DVD or iso files to your SSD. I can give the proceedure if you need it.
