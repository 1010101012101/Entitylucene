Why do I get this alert saying I purchased this app on a different computer (while I didn't)? <body> I tried to open an app I hadn't opened for a while, after which I got a window prompting me to login with my Apple ID. Here follows a translation of the (dutch) text:     h3Log in to use this app on this computer/h3      [Aforementioned app] was purchased via the App Store on a different computer. Log in with the   Apple ID and the password with which [aforementioned app] was   purchased to use it on this computer.   I am very sure I bought it using this computer, since I have only one. I have updated the OS since, though - would that be enough to trigger this alert?  By the way, I am very sure this is not a phishing trick. (If it is, the phisher already has enough access to my computer to display system modals, so in that case I have bigger worries than just my Apple ID.)
