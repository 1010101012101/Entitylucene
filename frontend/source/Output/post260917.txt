Issue when I rebooted my MBP 2012 <body> I have a little issue this morning when I rebooted my MBP 2012. In reality, I got rid of OSX to Ubuntu, and when I rebooted my MBP, the following image appears. Could anyone be able to tell me what do I have to do to retrieve my OS without losing anything? I know I could use cmd + R, but I will lose everything.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3afob.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
