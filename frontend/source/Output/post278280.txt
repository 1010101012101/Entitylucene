Can you use a macro to locate a plist file using Key Maestro or other on Sierra 10.12.1? <body> Sorry in advance for the lengthy post.  There is a bug in a midi instrument plugin I'm running that can be fixed temporarily by editing its plist file.  However, after editing it and using the plugin, the plist is updated by its program and has to be edited next time it is used.  I'm trying to create a macro to open Plist Edit Pro, make edits and save.  Unfortunately, when I try to do a search for the Plist file in finder, it shows no result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l55GT.jpg" alt="Finder Screen Shows No Search Results"Outside the macro I can manually go to the file by choosing OPTION + GO menu, selecting Library and selecting it from the list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4jYwl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"Recording mouse moves might've been a workaround but the file list can change if software is added or removed.    Any ideas of a way to do this?  I don't understand why when you type the name of the plist file in the search prompt in finder it just wont locate it even if you are in the library directory and see it right in from of you!/P The plug in vendor promises a fix but it has been months.  <comment350164> Have you tried just using the `defaults` command to modify the plist file from Terminal? <comment350166> I would probably do this in bash (Terminal)  What edits do you need to make?  In fact, off the top of my head, I would make a *copy* of the plist file, save it somewhere and every time I needed to "fix" the plist file again, I would have a script that copies it back for you. <comment350340> Great suggestion Allan!  Copy makes perfect sense.
