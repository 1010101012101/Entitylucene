Boot Camp won't work: why don't I have disk0s0 or disk0s1 partitions? <body> I'm trying to use Boot Camp after resolving a partition mess. I've gotten back to a single partition after receiving the strongThe startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition./strong message from Boot Camp Assistant, so I figure it should be happy, but I'm still getting the same message.   precodemy-MBP:~ uname$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk0    1:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            749.8 GB   disk0s2 /dev/disk2 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Boot Camp              +1.4 GB     disk2 /code/pre  For no great reason, I'm guessing that even if there's only one partition, if it's not in the first spot(?) Boot Camp Assistant isn't happy. Is this reasonable? Any ideas to get Boot Camp working?  edit:  precodemy-MBP:~ uname$ diskutil cs list No CoreStorage logical volume groups found /code/pre  edit:  Since it looks like i messed with the EFI partition, i looked at this question. I can't figure out how to make the answer apply to me, but here's some more output:  precodemy-MBP:~ uname$ sudo gpt -r show disk0 Password:        start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34      409606                409640  1464477344      1  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1464886984      262151            1465149135          32         Sec GPT table   1465149167           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  Can i maybe use the code409606/code block to remake EFI? Looks like it's the right size but isn't a partition?  hr  OS X 10.11.2 MacBook Pro 13-inch, Late 2011 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 750 GB SATA Disk Toshiba MK7559GSXF  <answer238461> I can hardly imagine someone will have a similar problem, but if they do:  Seems like Bootcamp wants to see an EFI partition. Once again, here was the codegpt show/code output from above:  precodemy-MBP:~ uname$ sudo gpt show disk0        start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34      409606                409640  1464477344      1  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1464886984      262151            1465149135          32         Sec GPT table   1465149167           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  As per the details in this question, i learned that the EFI partition should start at code40/code with a size of code409600/code. To mess with codedisk0/code (for me, the current and only disk), i booted in internet recovery by holding âŒ˜-R, unmounted disk0 with   precodediskutil unmountDisk disk0 /code/pre  then re-added by EFI partition using   precodesudo gpt add -b 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk0 /code/pre  I removed the code-i 1/code bit (setting the partition index to 1) for fear of messing with the main partition (which had itself moved to index 1). Here's the codeman/code page for codegpt/code.   (The above apple.stackexchange answer describes how to reformat the EFI partition. I didn't do that and haven't run into any trouble so far. Maybe i'll regret it.)  To fix the incorrect indices, i followed Rod Smith's instructions here. It's all pretty clear, but briefly:  ol liDownload and install the package./li liRun codegdisk /dev/disk0/code (or whatever disk you're working with)/li litype code?/code to get to the main menu/li lityped codes/code to sort the indices, then codew/code to write the changes/li /ol  No more Bootcamp errors. Hooray!  <comment291793> Please also add the output of `diskutil cs list` to your question. <comment291794> updated! thanks <comment291803> Okay, I missed where it said "(disk image)" for "/dev/disk2" however even that's not making sense to me.  Hopefully @patrix will see this thread as he's very good in this area. <comment291804> @user3439894 I'm not sure exactly what your area of expertise is, but do you know if i can partition the drive in a way that makes bootcamp think it did so itself? thanks for your help! <comment291806> It's been too many years since I messed around with Boot Camp so while I had installed Windows without using the Boot Camp Assistant in the distant past, all I remember at this point is I used Disk Utility to partition the disk.  That said, I think there's a bigger issue you need to resolve first and that is why you only have a Macintosh HD partition and no EFI and Recovery HD partitions, which should be present. patrix is very good with issues in this area, disk layout etc., and I put the @ before his name in my last comment so he should be notified by that.
