Why does Reply to All not work in my AppleScript? <body> I'm creating a script that will follow-up with people if they have not responded to me and all is looking good, except I cannot get the script to work correctly when set to "reply to all".   precodeset mailCheck to "message://"  tell application "Reminders"   repeat with i from 1 to (count of every reminder of list "MailButler")      --set variables     set theReminder to reminder i of list "MailButler"     set reminderName to the name of theReminder      --is complete?     if theReminder is not completed then         --has due date?         if theReminder is not completed then             --is it an email follow-up?             if mailCheck is in body of theReminder then                 if priority of theReminder is 5 then                     if due date of theReminder ≤ (current date) then                         --REPLY AND SEND EMAIL                         set emailID to body of theReminder                         set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "&lt;"                         set emailID to text item 2 of emailID                         set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "&gt;"                         set emailID to text item 1 of emailID                         set myReply to "I haven't heard back from you on this.

Any ideas of what I can do to correct this? Ultimately if I can just get it to reply to the original recipient I'm golden as that's all I'm really trying to achieve.
