How to browse /usr in an Open File dialog? <body> I came to the necessity of browsing and picking up a file from code/usr/code while using some programming tools, but I cannot do so because code/usr/code seems to be hidden from Open File dialog.  Is there any workaround?  <answer118187> Go to that folder: kbdshift/kbd + kbdcommand/kbd + kbdg/kbd   type code/usr/code and press kbdreturn/kbd  <comment137917> Thanks, that sounds better than my current workaround: create a symbol link of /usr in home directory.
