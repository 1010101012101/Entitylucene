What causes a full restart vs a resume when battery dies? <body> There are many times where if my macbook pro dies, it will simply resume where it left off once i plug in the power and turn it on. Other times, it will do a complete restarting and I will loose all my unsaved data.  What causes one vs the other? Preferably, I would like it to always resume instead of restart.  <answer253440> This is likely the cause of your system going down while in the process of performing a reboot. The most common cause of this is system updates loading in the background. Lots of times these updates will require a restart after installing. In addition, do you happen to have the computer scheduled for reboot? This can be confirmed in System Preferences  Energy Saver  Schedule. Resume only occurs if the last known state was you logged into your home account.   <comment315382> something un-recoverable caused by the system loosing power, or the battery was to flat to be used at all in such a way.
