Finding file in parent folder of an AppleScript <body> I have an AppleScript that calls another script (a perl script in this case) which resides in the same folder as the AppleScript.br Now I'm trying to put the script into a variable like this:  precodetell application "Finder"     set scriptPath to POSIX path of (container of (path to me) as text)     set perlScript to (do shell script "find " &amp; quoted form of scriptPath &amp; " -name myscript.pl") end tell /code/pre  But the result that I get from the find shell command has two slashes before the file name: code/path/to/folder//myscript.pl/codebr Anyone any idea what I'm doing wrong?   strongEDIT:/strongbr While I don't quite understand the double slash I managed to resolve the problem by not invoking the Finder at all and doing the following:  precodeset scriptPath to POSIX path of (path to me) -- path to AppleScript set scriptFolder to do shell script "dirname " &amp; quoted form of scriptPath -- path to folder with AppleScript set perlScript to (do shell script "find " &amp; quoted form of scriptFolder &amp; " -name myscript.pl") -- path to PerlScript /code/pre  Don't know if that's the best way to do it but it works for me.  <answer239087> Here is an answer to get right the pathname of code../code from AppleScript:  Get Current Path to Script within AppleScript and Append Subdirectory  Anyway, the actual construct you got: code/path/to/folder//myscript.pl/code is a correct pathname to your Perl script. The 1st code//code is coming from the terminal one coming from codecontainer/code: code/path/to/folder//code.  Hence your built find command is very similar to this one you might try to experiment:  precodefind ~/ -name "Documents" -print /code/pre  Hint: work directly in Perl, it is many times more efficient than any AppleScript.  <comment293314> I had looked at that answer but it gives me a `Canâ€™t make quoted form of alias "Macintosh HD:path:to:folder:" into type Unicode text.` error.  I am trying to incorporate the perlscript into an applescript because I want to eventually set up a watched folder ... I wouldn't know how to do that with perl directly.  -- But you say that the `/path/to/folder//myscript.pl` form is correct?  Why the two slashes? <comment293332> It actually does work with the two slashes!  True (but funny).    As does your other solution.  I resolved it differently, however (see edits), looks "prettier" to me (but I don't know whether it could run into other problems).
