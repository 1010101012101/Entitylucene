autocomplete in zsh after `npm run tdd` command <body> I'm using OS X 10.10.3, I have installed codezsh/code. And every time when I want to run a specific test I configured in codepackage.json/code to execute codenpm run tdd/code followed by the test file.  In linux systems if I press tab after this command:  codenpm run tdd ~//code  will show me the folders or will attempt to autocomplete the instruction, however this doesn't happen in codezsh/code on OS X, it just makes the noise like there are no recommendations for this.  How can this be fixed?  <answer225201> Add the following to your .zshrc:  precodeautoload -Uz compinit compinit /code/pre  that should get you going. Now, read  precodeman zshcompsys /code/pre  <comment273313> it doesn't work :(, reading zshcompsys though. <comment273453> sorry, could not find anything that help with this :( <comment273461> @Nico From `man zshcompsys`: "If the system was installed completely, it should be enough to call the shell function `compinit` from your initialization file;". <comment273472> Calling compinit doesn't fix de issue
