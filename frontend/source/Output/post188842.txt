Black Screen With Cursor on Logout in Yosemite <body> This is specifically occurring on Yosemite Macs that have been NetRestored. Initial login works fine. However, when restarting the Mac or logging out of the user, a black screen appears with only the mouse cursor there. (Please note this is on logout, not login. I'm quite familiar with the login issue.)  I cannot even get out of it by sending a Restart (Lose Changes) command through ARD. Only a manual force shut down solves the issue.   In the past, I've removed the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist file and it's solved the issue. However, it's still occurring now. Any suggestions?  <comment223613> Does [verbose mode](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201573) give any clues? <comment223653> How long did you wait? I've seen an issue that can make your computer take about two minutes to shutdown. Also, there is a slightly safer force restart by pushing `command + ctrl + power button`. More advisable. <comment223908> Sadly, verbose mode didn't really help here. And I left a Mac sitting there for 30-45 minutes. In the end, I destroyed the LoginWindow.plist and that seemed to resolve the issue. <comment240890> Used to be I could SSH in when this happened and kill `loginwindow`; lately that's not even working and I think I'll need to do a full restart.  Driving me *crazy*.
