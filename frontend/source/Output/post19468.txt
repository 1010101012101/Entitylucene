Terminal text size different when connected to external monitor <body> I have a Macbook Pro 15" running OS X 10.6.8. When not connected to an external monitor, launching Terminal looks like this. Note the width of the text (almost looks bold). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKriQ.png" alt="enter image description here" When connected to my 24" Dell 2408WFP monitor (via Mini DisplayPort to DVI connector), launching Terminal looks like this. Note the skinny non-bold appearance of the text. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AqaJ1.png" alt="enter image description here" Even more odd is Terminal decides on the text style depending on strongwhen/strong the app was first launched. If Terminal was initially launched with no external monitor connected, it uses the bold style. If I keep Terminal open and hot connect to my Dell monitor, all subsequent new Terminal windows will use the bold style. If I exit Terminal and relaunch, it uses the skinny non-bold text.  This behavior is really annoying as I prefer the non-external monitor bold appearance.  Oddly, at work I have an iMac connected to a 24" Apple Cinema Display and all Terminal instances uses the bold style text. I suspect Terminal on startup is detecting the monitor(s) and doing something to the text style.  Is there anyway to disable this behavior?  strongFollow-Up:/strong I'm seeing this behavior in other applications such as iTerm and Firefox. I suspect it's a operation system issue.  <answer19472> After some searching, this appears to be a known issue. OS X somehow isn't fully aware my Dell monitor, and is not applying the same font smoothing. The font smoothing can be set using:  precodedefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2 /code/pre  See this superuser and macrumors threads.
