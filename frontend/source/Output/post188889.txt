How to "refresh" a mounted NFS folder from my router in Finder? <body> I have a rt-n56u router with an external hard disk shared in NFS.  Sometimes this shared disk shows in Finder, sometimes not, and I need to reboot router AND mac yosemite - even if I can see it being shared in my router's admin interface - to make it available in my sidebar. Sometimes, I need to wait some minutes for it to show.  What can I do to "force", "refresh", "flush cache" or something like this for my hard disk to show again without all this hassle? I'm fine with command line.  <answer188901> Using the Connect to Server in Finder you can set the URL and force a refresh.  In Finder Go  Connect to Server or kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd + kbdK/kbd From there you can add the URL to your server.  This Apple support article has further details.  I hope this helps.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xD98e.png" alt="Connect to Server dialog box"  <comment224029> It's NFS, not afp. I tried this command but it didn't work, I get "You don't have permission", and, after a few minutes, my Finder automatically connects to the NFS perfectly. That's what I'm trying to solve. <comment224035> Sorry that wasn't helpful. I did find this support [article](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18718?locale=en_US) does refer to NFS.  You may have already come across this in your research though. Hope you find a solution.
