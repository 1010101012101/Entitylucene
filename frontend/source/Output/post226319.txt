How has it suddenly become so much faster to wake OS X from "safe sleep"? <body> Because I'm super paranoid about security, I configure my MacBook to always "safe sleep" and destroy its FileVault key on entering standby:  precode$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 DestroyFVKeyOnStandby 1 /code/pre  As explained under pmset(1):     hibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.   and:     destroyfvkeyonstandby - Destroy File Vault Key when going to standby mode. By default File vault keys are retained even when system goes to standby. If the keys are destroyed, user will be prompted to enter the password while coming out of standby mode.(value: 1 - Destroy, 0 - Retain)   Consequently, when the machine wakes from sleep one must:  ol lifirst unlock FileVault at an EFI lock screen; and then/li liunlock OS X at a login window./li /ol  Historically, there was an understandable delay between these two steps, as OS X has to restore from disk image (copying the hibernatefile into RAM) before it's able to do anything else.  Whilst this was happening, the display would show the login window overlaid by a semi-transparent covering together with a progress bar.  strongHowever, I no longer witness any delay between steps 1 and 2./strong  It appears that OS X is able to resume almost as soon as FileVault is unlocked, which suggests to me that power may not have been removed from RAM as promised by hibernatemode 25.  What's going on?  Have, as the logs below suggest, Apple found some magical way to restore gigabytes of RAM from disk image impercetably fast (and, if so, wouldn't every laptop user prefer to "safe sleep", perhaps without destroying FileVault keys, rather than keeping RAM powered and wasting battery)?  Or, more likely(?), is my MacBook no longer really entering "safe sleep"?  If the latter, emwhy/emâ€”and how can I fix it?  hr  pre $ sw_vers ProductName:    Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.11.3 BuildVersion:   15D21  $ pmset -g System-wide power settings:  SleepDisabled      0  DestroyFVKeyOnStandby      1 Active Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay         10800  standby              1  womp                 0  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  powernap             0  gpuswitch            2  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            10  sleep                1  autopoweroffdelay    14400  hibernatemode        25  autopoweroff         0  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         10  acwake               0  lidwake              1  $ cat /var/log/system.log Feb  5 01:19:35 eggyal PowerChime[622]: 53728.262434: GOING TO SLEEP: kStateDarkWake -

You should be prompted for creds twice: once by EFI for Filevault, then a progress bar as the Filevault volume is mounted and hibernation image restored, then a second authentication from the OS to log back in.  codesudo pmset -f log/code may help to confirm what's going on.  For what it's worth, I've also found that the hibernatemode=25 option seems broken. Testing on a 2013 MacbookAir6,2 / A1466 running 10.11.5 with hibernatemode=25 (direct-to-standby, skip sleep), the machine did hibernate on closing the lid after I'd first enabled this option. However it's not done it again. (I did update to 10.11.5 in the interim...)  Apple's documentation https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202124 says, "Notebooks need to be running on battery power [and] must not have any external connections (such as Ethernet, USB, Thunderbolt, SD card, displays, Bluetooth, and so on)" in order to go into standby.  Paying attention to the above conditions, I've tested this a few times and my machine will only go into standby (and thus, destroy the Filevault key if destroyfvkeyonstandby is enabled) when the battery is fully depleted.  i.e. hibernatemode=25 doesn't actually work as documented in pmset(1).  <comment277722> Further evidence that I'm not really entering safe sleep: yesterday my battery was at ~26% when it went to sleep, and had discharged to 5% by the time it woke.  In safe sleep, with power entirely removed, the battery should barely discharge at all (same as when shutdown).  I haven't tested to see what happens if the battery discharges entirely, but I have a hunch it won't be able to restore but will boot anew. <comment277724> What OS version are you using? <comment277725> @Wilcard: See the top of the pasted output.
