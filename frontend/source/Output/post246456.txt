Launch Terminal using BetterTouchTool <body> How would I open Terminal using BetterTouchTool? I tried using predefined action: open application, but I can't seem to find the Terminal app.  <answer246475> As user3439894 said, have you tried looking for Terminal in the Utilities folder rather than the applications folder. Hope This Helps :)  <comment303897> Possible duplicate of [Open an ssh session in terminal with BetterTouchTool](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/228333/open-an-ssh-session-in-terminal-with-bettertouchtool) <comment303900> The Terminal app is located in: `/Applications/Utilities`
