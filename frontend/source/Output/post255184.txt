Where does kextload read certificates from? <body> I've gone through XNU's source code and found nothing like an option for compiling certificates into the kernel. I thought that that was where root certificates for kernel extension and executable verification would reside since SIP is kernel-side technology. I now know that it is codekextload/code and codekextd/code that handle kernel extension verification. The code handling that is found in codesecurity.c/code of the codekext_tools/code project.  I want to know where it gets the X.509 certificates that it uses to verify kernel extensions. Where in the filesystem are these certificates stored? How are they retrieved? Do they use the keychain interface?
