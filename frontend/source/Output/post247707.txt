Why does AirPlay disconnect when opening Pokemon Go? <body> I use Plex to watch TV/Movies (which stream from my home network) and I AirPlay it to my Apple TV. When AirPlaying, I have no problem navigating away to check my messages, etc.  However when I open emsome/em apps, usually games such as Pokemon Go (I like to wait for Pokemon while watching casual shows), it disconnects the AirPlay. Seconds later I hear my show playing through my phone speakers and I have to navigate to the Plex app to stop it.  Why does this happen and how can I prevent AirPlay from disconnecting?  <comment305738> I would wager it's something to do with the way Pokemon Go accesses the audio system on the phone and/or it's programmed to disallow use of AirPlay. <comment305739> @tubedogg I have sounds turned off on the game and.. why would it disallow AirPlay? Why would it even do that? <comment305740> You'd have to ask Niantic. They're the only ones that could answer that specific question (or your broader question in general) with any certainty. <comment305741> @tubedogg Well I was asking why *would* they not why *do* they, to pick your brain for any reason you _think_ could be the case <comment305742> I have no idea. It doesn't make much sense. The other thing is it may be a funky interaction between the apps - it isn't necessarily something done on purpose.
