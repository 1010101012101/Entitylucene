Delete iTunes U downloads without removing their reference <body> I have many iTunes U videos that take a lot of space on my disk. I don't really need them on my disk but I would like to keep their reference in my iTunes U library so I can re-download them when needed.  How can I do that?  <answer72334> Delete the videos. Then right-click on the course title and select emShow all available items/em. This will restore the complete list of available episodes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4DU66.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also do this by option-clicking on the disclosure arrow of the course. The arrow needs to be closed before option-clicking in order for this to work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPrlR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment83960> I haven't checked this myself, but isn't there a "Downloads" or "Purchased" tab in iTunes U, that you can easily get previous downloads? That is possible with music, apps, etc. so I'm guessing it would work with iTunes U. <comment83984> I want to have it in my list with the option "get" as I had it before downloading.
