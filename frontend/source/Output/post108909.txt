Create key, certificate signing request, p12 file and provisioning file on Ubuntu for Mac keychain <body> I use Ubuntu OS most of the time but I also have used OS X for quite a time and now I only use it to maintain my iOS apps. I am trying to create private key, certificate signing request for certificate and p12 key and provisioning file on Ubuntu and I think I am missing something.  precodeopenssl genrsa -out mykey.key 2048 /code/pre  This generates private key for me to generate Certificate Signing Request.   precodeopenssl req -new -key mykey.key -out CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest -subj /emailAddress=my@email.com, CN=Umair Ashraf, C=PK /code/pre  This is generates Certificate Signing Request for me to send it to Apple to sign it.   I downloaded strongios_development.cer/strong file from apple and I have 3 files in hand. Now I want to create p12 out of them so I can import them in keychain of my OS X machine.  precodeopenssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -inkey ./mykey.key -in ./ios_development.cer -out ./dev_testing.p12 -name "Umair Ashraf" /code/pre  This creates me p12 file but with an error which reads strongunable to load certificates/strong. When I tested this p12 file, it did not seem to work as well. What am I missing.  I also want to ask if this p12 file will be password protected? If not how can I password protect it?  <comment127562> I found this question helpful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6023279/how-to-find-out-the-password-to-a-p12-document-made-in-openssl
