Can't restore iPhone in order to downgrade <body> I just downloaded the iOS 11 beta from Apple's developer website, but I'm having such a headache downgrading back to iOS 10.3.2.  I installed their provisioning profile from their website, as instructed on their site.  strongTo restore, I did the following:/strong  I restarted my iPhone to recovery mode to restore it, only to be presented this message:      the iPhone could not be updated. Declined to authorize this image on this device for this user   I rebooted it to find the provisioning profile in order to delete it, only to find that the management page in settings was not there and neither Xcode/Devices nor Apple Configurator 2 showed any profiles.  Now I'm stuck on iOS 11, and I can't figure out how to downgrade.  Do you have any ideas?
