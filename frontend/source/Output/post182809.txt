How to clear the Photos icon badge <body> For some reason that is not clear to me, the Photos app icon on the dock of my Yosemite OS now displays a badge (the number 1 in a red circle top right corner)  First of all, I have no idea what that badge is suppose to represent.  Second, when I launch the app I have not idea what the thing is that I'm suppose to look at, acknowledge or in some way "touch" so that the badge goes away.  <answer182877> Supposing you're talking about iOS, the badge may mean somebody commented or liked one of your photos on a shared folder.  <answer182895> If you haven't already, turn on the sidebar - kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdS/kbd - then look towards the top and under Shared, click Activity. Likely there is some activity on a shared album or Photo Stream. It may also be someone inviting you to join a shared album or Photo Stream. (I'm not sure how that would show up in Photos, as I haven't had any invitations since Photos was released.)  Either way I'm guessing once you take a look at that area, the badge will disappear.  <comment217824> Sorry if I'm missing the exact name for the shared folder or photo stream but I have Spanish as my language on my iPhone. <comment217825> No I'm referring specifically to the photos app that replaces iPhoto on Yosemite <comment217827> Ok, please clarify on your question, it will be easier to answer. <comment218185> I've added Yosemite to the text of my question, although I want to point out that the original post was tagged as a yosemite question. <comment218190> Great, I just thought it may disambiguate the OS you were referring to. I did not see the Yosemite tag at the time, my bad. <comment218191> Did you find out what the badge was after turning on the sidebar? <comment218192> Yes it was a "Like" added to a shared photo by one of my family members
