Drag feature on Iphone itunes playlist <body> The drag feature in edit on ITunes on my iphone is no longer working.  I have over 300 songs in a playlist and now when I go to edit and try to drag a newer song to a new position it just pops back to the original position.  However it will still let me reorganize some of the songs that are near the top of the playlist.  Just not the ones further down the list.  Any ideas?  <comment321800> What have you already done to resolve the problem?  We don't want to suggest things that you've already tried. <comment322012> What iOS version are you using?
