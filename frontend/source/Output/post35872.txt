Awful noise when starting up Apple TV <body> I seem to be having the same problem as another user:  "TV connected to AppleTV makes horrible noise on startup and when waking up from standby"  In my case, I'm using a stereo receiver for audio playback (instead of a TV).  I'm using the optical audio out, but it goes through an analog converter and goes into my receiver as stereo RCA.  The horrible static noise starts when I turn on the apple TV and receiver.  The noise disappears as soon as I press play on my iphone or itunes.  The static doesn't come back when I press pause - it only occurs from the time that apple TV starts up until I press play.  Hmmmmmm....  <comment41042> is it the same noise as an electric guitar plugged into an amp and not playing? this is caused by an electrical singnal being sent to the reciever from the unit. It is standard on this type of thing. <comment45119> I have the same setup and the same problem. Anyone has any solution for this? The Apple TV, the DA converter and the cables are all new. The problem only occurs on startup, so it's not likely caused by the cables. It's almost certainly caused by the Apple TV or the DA converter. But after googling the problem, it seems most likely to be a problem with the Apple TV. <comment51685> I'm having the **exact** same issue - Apple TV 1080 to DAC via optical to Powered Speakers via RCA -- 5-10 seconds of awful static before music starts playing. Nothing seems to fix it including removing the HDMI. Makes the Apple TV useless as an audio device to stream music. Thus shouldn't be rocket science. sigh.
