Choose a tab in textmate 2 <body> Choosing :  I use a European keyboard (french) and I can't use ⌘1, ⌘2 etc. to access a specific tab with TM2.  These shorcuts are used by the Finder to choose a Desktop (Space).  In the Preferences System, I use the default keys : ^&amp; , ^é to go to a Desktop (Mission Control). These shortcuts works perfectly but ⌘1, ⌘2 works also perfectly in the Finder to go to the Desktop 1 etc. In TM2 go to tab use ⌘1, ⌘2 but these shortcuts don't work for me in TM2. So I have two possibilities to switch between Desktops in the Finder and none in TM2 to switch between Tabs !!  strongMy question is how to modify the shortcuts in TM2 or in Finder ?/strong  I would like to be able to use ⌘1, ⌘2 (or a different shortcut) in Textmate to choice a tab (file) .  or strongHow to remove the shortcuts ⌘1, ⌘2 used by the Finder to go to Desktop?/strong  Switching :  A) Remarks about switching tabs in TM2    I can switch between tabs with ⌘} and ⌘{ but I can also make a switch with ⌘⌥- and ⌘⌥&lt;-. I think it's strange to have two different shortcuts to make the same action  B) Remarks about switching Desktops (spaces) in the Finder   I can use ^- and ^&lt;-  <answer85681> You can change the Mission Control shortcuts in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sOQXl.png" alt=""  <comment98726> Welcome to Ask Different!

I see two possibilities : modify something in the Finder or something in TM. And I think it's very strange to have two shortcuts for the same action in the Finder and in TM2. <comment98742> No it's insufficient. In this case I have ^⌘1, ^⌘2 and always ⌘1, ⌘2. The Finder steals the keys. The problem is how to remove the shortcuts ⌘1, ⌘2 of the Finder. Another  possibility is to make some changes inside TM2. A last remark, on the french system the view options of the view menu in the Finder are ⌘⌥1-4 and not ⌘1-4.
