Change space of other non-active display via keyboard <body> My two displays (let call them codeA/code and codeB/code) have separate spaces. I can go back and forth among the spaces on the active/focussed display codeA/code. Is it possible to go back and forth among the spaces on codeB/code with keyboard shortcuts and without moving the focus to codeB/code?  I do not mean assigning keyboard shortcuts to each space, because there are more than ten spaces and plenty of maximized windows.  <answer244189> There is another question here on Ask Different that answer this question:  Keyboard shorcut to switch focus between multiple displays on OS X 10.9.5 + (mavericks, el capitan, sierra)  Here's the quick summary:  There are some utilities (window managers) that allow you to assign a keyboard shortcut to the focus of a specific monitor.  They are as follows (links provided):  ul liCatchmouse (No longer available so it's a moot point here)/li liDivvy - $13/li liSizeUp - $13/li liSlate - Open Source, Free.  Functional, but there's a lot of manual configuration to be done here and not as easy as the paid software.  /li /ul  <comment300899> it is said that [this small script](https://github.com/jigish/slate/issues/458#issuecomment-209088893) solves the problem, I do no know where to put this script. [This answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/116889/189271) reports that he solved my problem and gives [this config file for Slate](https://github.com/abbood/slateConfig/blob/master/.slate); but it did not work for me. <comment300936> You put the scripts in your home directory.  I suggest you read the documentation:  [JavaScript Configs](https://github.com/jigish/slate/wiki/JavaScript-Configs).  If the script doesn't work, you should contact the author of the config/script.  Remember, this being open source **you** have to do a lot of the customization yourself.  If this is beyond your scope, you should look at one of the paid software applications.
