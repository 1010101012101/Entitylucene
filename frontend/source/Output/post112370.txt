Substitue Escape for Control U in Terminal <body> I would like to change codebash/code keybinding so that the Escape key has the same effect as Control U. For example, if I tap the Escape key, the current Terminal command will be cleared out (which is what Control U does). How can I specify both the Escape key and the Control modifier when writing a new key definition in my .bash_profile?  <answer112428> codebind '"\e":"\C-u"'/code doesn't have any effect, and escape can't be remapped from Terminal's preferences.  iTerm 2 does allow remapping escape:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NlFHA.png" alt=""  0x05 0x15 is C-e C-u. (E is 0x45 and U is 0x55.)  You could also use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;appdef&gt;     &lt;appname&gt;TERMINAL&lt;/appname&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.apple.Terminal&lt;/equal&gt;   &lt;/appdef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;only&gt;TERMINAL&lt;/only&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::ESCAPE, ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::E, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::U, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  The last two options  would prevent using escape in for example vi though.  <comment131911> Do you want to have Escape behave the same way as currently Ctrl-U does or the other way round? Either way, which key function are you trying to duplicate (what do you want both keys to do afterwards)? <comment131965> Sorry for the lack of clarity. I want Escape to behave like Control U does; I want Escape to clear the current command from Terminal. <comment131997> With the various functions the Esc key has in bash (primarily for command-line editing both in emacs and vi mode) this might not be very useful (or break a lot of other things).
