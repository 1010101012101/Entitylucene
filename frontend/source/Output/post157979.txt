/usr/local doesn't exist in fresh install Yosemite <body> I am trying to install ssh-copy-id, and it wants to be placed in   precode/usr/local/bin/ /code/pre  but when I do  precodecd /usr/local/ /code/pre  it responds with  precode-bash: cd: /usr/local/: No such file or directory /code/pre  Is this because I have a fresh install of Yosemite and the changed the location of code/usr/local//code?  <answer157981> /usr/local does not exist on a standard plain OS X install  You need to create it by  precodesudo mkdir /usr/local /code/pre  In some odd cases e.g. for Homebrew you need to change permissions  <comment185787> So if I make the folder for `/usr/local/bin/`. Will the items I place in that folder, be immediately available in bash? Or do I have to add a reference to `/usr/local/bin/`? <comment185789> Check $PATH - I think that /usr/local/bin is on the standard path - if not you need to add it (I have not had a clean install for many versions :))
