Create a standalone photo album <body> I have one series of photos that I show to people I meet often. Using the iOS Photos app with an album is fine, except that it takes a while to launch and then find the right album, and sometimes that app is slow.  What I'd like is to have an app (or an export process, or emsomething/em) which allows me to select some photos maybe the first time I launch it, and then just displays those photos, and only those photos, when I start it up. I'd just like them to fill the screen and I could swipe between them.  Then, I could just pop open my phone, launch that app, and be showing the photos immediately.  Does anyone have any good ideas?  <answer259625> Create an iCloud Shared Album and give it a web URL, then "bookmark" that URL with a home screen icon.  ol liOpen the Photos app and tap on the Shared tab./li liIf you don't see the + icon at the upper-left, tap "&lt; Sharing" there. Tap the + icon./li liGive your album a name and tap Next. Optionally, share it with contact(s). Tap Create./li liTap on the album you just created. Add photos by tapping on + in the grey square./li liTap on the People tab. Turn on Public Website. You'll be provided a URL./li liTap Share Link and then tap Copy./li liOpen Safari and paste the URL into the address bar. Tap the Share icon at the bottom and tap Add to Home Screen./li /ol  Anytime you want to share the photos in this album with people, just tap on the icon on your home screen.  <comment325333> Well done @tubedogg. The only downside is that I can't view it if I'm offline. <comment325360> Hm. Also it's a bit difficult to control the order.
