YouTube at double speed on mobile <body> How do I listen to YouTube videos at double-speed?   On the desktop I'm able to change the playback speed to 1.5x or 2x. With podcasts, I'm able to listen to them on my iPhone at 1.5x or 2x speed. Shouldn't  I be able to watch YouTube videos at double speed on the iOS app?  <answer121986> strongNo/strong, mobile versions often have much strongless/strong functionality. With the official YouTube app there is (currently) no function to speed up a video.  There might be an external app containing this feature, but by default there is no functionality for this.  <answer121987> strongThis app seems not to be available in the Store anymore/strong  The Swift Player app should be able to accomplish what you need, but it is $3.99, so that might not be an option.  <answer157667> strongYou can/strong, and it will cost you nothing.  ol liOn the video's mobile Youtube page, tap the menu button at the top left (or right).

It's one of the best because it has:  ul liplayback speed control/li liswipe gestures to jump forward/backward/li livideo quality lock /li /ul  I always use all three to watch tutorials and such.  <answer215064> Just install the Puffin browser and enjoy..  <answer229731> Just download SpeedTube on the app store  <answer235715> I HAVE THE ANSWER ;)  Uninstall youtube app if you have it.  Go to App Store - download "chrome".  Open it and go to youtube.com.  On the top right there are three dots - request desktop site  If you play the video you should be able to see the gear on the bottom right of the video player!  Thank me later.  <answer246036> I've released a new app made just for this: Speedeo  You can watch any YouTube videos on it at up to 2x the speed. Great for tutorials, presentations, and just saving time in general.  Note: I'm one of the authors of the app. If you have any feedback please let me know!  <answer250798> Tubex is a free (ad-supported) iOS app that offers a range of playback speeds and picture-in-picture support, in addition to all the usual YouTube functionality.  <answer273430> I made an action extension for iOS Safari that does just that. For those unaware, action extension basically adds button to Safari action sheet that allows you to adjust video playback speed. Works on both iPhone and iPad. It works with YouTube and virtually any other HTML5 video player, in Safari itself, rather then having to open different app. https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1205188880  <answer280530> strongI created Playbex (both for iPhone and iPad)/strong  You can change the speed of your videos (Youtube, TEDx, Vimeo, KhanAcademy etc) right from the browser.  It's easy to install and requires just two clicks.  <answer288438> You can install strongMyTube/strong from the app store which is strongfree/strong (non-paid).   During playback, click the box containing the number 1 and set your desired speed such as 1.5 or 2.0. Intermediate speeds such as 1.25 are unfortunately not available.   The app is strongad supported/strong, so you might get a couple of ads as you interact with the app.  <comment288317> Wow, YouTube is 48MB, but Chrome is 69MB! <comment288335> I found that you do not need to uninstall YouTube. You can ignore the prompt to open in YouTube, or change the setting in Chrome to *not* use YouTube. You also have to click the ... twice to request the desktop site, once in the YouTube page, and again in the Chrome app. They both have the '...'. If you only request desktop site in one of them, then it just changes the layout but the video widget is the standard Apple one with no controls. I also found that it *remembers* the 2x speed, so that's good! <comment288446> My iTunes shows a popup saying "The item you've requested is not currently available in the U.S. store", so I can't get it either. <comment288447> Surprisingly, my iTunes shows a popup saying "The item you've requested is not currently available in the U.S. store". <comment302197> The downside is that you can't watch the video fullscreen because it's "not supported". It's too bad youtube doesn't just add this feature to their app. <comment304359> You also happen to have made it... <comment305242> Did you also post the original question? This seems spammy to me. <comment305243> ? No... I have no affiliation with Chloe. I'm just the maker of the app <comment305395> You don't answer with bla bla bla in an answer. That's really arrogant and immature. <comment311051> This is fantastic! Thank you for making this - you've significantly improved my quality of life.  It'd be nice if you integrated with the sharing widgets in iOS so I could open YouTube links directly in your app instead of copying the link and pasting it in. I'd also love to go faster than 2x (I routinely get up to ~3.5x with [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk)). <comment311053> @cgenco Thanks for the support and feedback! I'll let my team know about upping the maximum speed, although anything above 2.5x usually causes videos to become skippy. We will definitely be looking into the sharing widgets so stay tuned! <comment311054> Thanks for self-disclosing - that's all we ask is to let people know you have a connection with a product. +1 in my book - there's no time limit on adding a useful or new answer to any post. Thanks everyone for the clarifying comments <comment318728> This looks like nice app. A killer feature to add would be 10 Sec skip forward/backward like in Amazon's video player. <comment329624> I searched for 'Youtube speed' on App Store, could not find your app. Idea to have this sorted out for better SEO, good luck! <comment329631> @WimdenHerder thanks for the advice! look up "speedeo" if you can't find the app <comment340039> I just used this app. Jan 2017 <comment352864> This solution implies opening another app to change the speed. Playbex (posted below) can change the speed without leaving Safari. <comment353145> Chloe, you should check my answer because, opposed to the correct answer, it doesn't require leaving the browser (which I think it rocks) <comment353240> @TeodorCiuraru Are you referring to my answer? It doesn't require leaving the browser. <comment358756> @TeodorCiuraru You have been repeating that same promotion of your app several times in this question, and indeed even in the comment section for this answer. You have also repeatedly claimed that this answer "doesn't work" on TED, etc. My answer now—just like before—is: this answer is not meant to work on other sites. Reread the question that was asked. <comment358760> I wish they'd make extensions like these more visible somehow. I've never once gone on the AppStore with the thought of looking for, basically, a new button for the system's share action sheet. There's not even a separate category for it. AppStore ironically is a sad excuse for an app. <comment358781> You are right. I forgot about it only working for Youtube (I didn't remember the question when I added my last comment). I am sorry. <comment359047> You and me both, thanks for the kind words !
