macOS native VPN can't cifs:// into file server on another network <body> I have configured the macOS' native VPN to connect from location (a) to location (b), and now I would like to access the Thecus file storage server I have at location (b).  Accordingly, pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdK/kbd in Finder and typing: codecifs://192.168.x.x/code &lt;-- server IP here.  to access the server I cannot connect, it just keeps trying to connect. Connecting from home it works, just not from one office to the other.  How can I get this to work? I have even tried afp://  Both endpoints are Mac devices if that helps.   Interestingly, both locations are on the same sub-net (192.168.X).  Is there a way to overcome this? I have a feeling that I may have to change the subnet of one of the offices.   <answer288421> Use smb:// for file shares and vnc:// for screen shares. I’ve not had good success with cifs:// and Finder.   If smb fails, check for open ports using network utility and look at the console on Mac and error log on the server/Linux/pc side. Network utility will show you if you have an ip / network conflict. The vpn possibly can’t route any traffic correctly if both non-routable networks conflict. Either the local or remote will have to change NAT range or move to IPv6.   <comment364206> The two networks have to be different: so either 192.168.0.0/24 at (a) and 192.168.1.0/24 at (b) or the other way round. <comment364211> Klanomath I had thought as much. Is there no way around this? <comment364212> Sure - but a lot of work and appropriate devices are required: [Connecting to a remote server through a VPN when the local network subnet address conflicts with a remote network](https://serverfault.com/a/557030/246265) <comment364215> I have came across there earlier, think you have confirmed my suspicions
