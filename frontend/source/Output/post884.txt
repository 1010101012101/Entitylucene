Why am I getting the error "MobileMe does not sync with Microsoft Exchange Server"? <body> I am getting this error message every time a meeting request comes through, but I am not syncing anything with outlook or exchange, so I don't know what to change to get rid of it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XxlWn.jpg" alt="alt text"  These are my sync settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/76RYy.jpg" alt="alt text"  Any idea what's going on here?  <answer5951> The Outlook configuration is emprecisely/em what matters here. As per the error you got: strongMobileMe does not sync calendars with Microsoft Outlook when Outlook is configured to use Microsoft Exchange Server./strong  Calendar syncing takes place via calDAV. The account settings are specifically IMAP.  Unless there are custom profiles or the Outlook PST file is damaged, I'd suggest simply removing the account from Outlook, and signing out on the MobileMe Control Panel, then setting it up fresh.  <answer6871> Here is the solution: (Outlook 2007 with Exchange server 2003)  Remove MobileMe from the Outlook COM add-ins  Tools - Trust Center - Add-ins  then click on Go to Manage Add-ins  scroll down and disable then remove MobileMe from the list.  <comment6556> David, your answer doesn't make any sense -- how does Outlook affect the syncing of Safari bookmarks? <comment6557> How does bookmark syncing have anything to do with this problem? <comment8629> For me, the solution to remove the add-in in Outlook does not work. <comment17349> You need to run Outlook as an admin. This worked for me, but then the next day it does not work anymore, and now it doesnt work at all (the error comes up as frequently as it ever did). <comment73380> Did you check your Outlook configuration? It seems like the problem it's in there <comment73381> I'm not even asking it to sync calendars ... the outlook configuration should not matter.
