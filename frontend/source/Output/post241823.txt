How can I change the apperance of terminal to make it indentical to Ubuntu's terminal <body> I like using the default terminal application, but as I use both Ubuntu and OS X a lot I want to make them behave and look the same. How can I change the Mac terminal to make as identical as possible to the Ubuntu terminal?  edit: A similar post Can I make my Mac OS X Terminal color items according to syntax, like the Ubuntu terminal? does not answer my question for the following reasons:  ul liIt does not tell me what background color Ubuntu uses or if the colors given are the default colors that Ubuntu uses./li liGives me a multi line command prompt (I really prefer the single line prompt)/li liIt talks about syntax highlighting I am interested in other changes as well such as copying and pasting behavior./li liDoes not properly explain how codeexport PS1="\n$C_LIGHTGREEN\u$C_DARKGRAY@$C_BLUE\h $C_DARKGRAY: $C_LIGHTYELLOW\w\n$C_DARKGRAY\$$C_DEFAULT/code functions.   ul liFrom what I can tell in changes the prompt so that newline is light green, user appears next in dark gray and blue(?), host name appears in darkgrey, something else is light yellow(?), current working directory is darkgray and a newline is made (?) $(or # for root) is a default color./li liLooking at this website asnwers a bit of my question./li /ul/li /ul  <answer241856> You'll need to change the shell settings to match your current Ubuntu terminal. Simple way would be to make your local code.bashrc/code match the one used by Ubuntu (see here for an example of the Ubuntu default code.bashrc/code.) You can either plug the settings in to a code.bashrc/code file for all shells, or use a code.bash_profile/code in your home folder to set Terminal preferences for login shells. This post has more details on how to create these files.  Last, I imagine your Ubuntu terminal sessions aren't on a white screen - Adding in the codexterm-color/code settings will provide colored text, but won't affect the background color. I generally start by making the "Homebrew" Terminal display setting the default in OS X, to get black background + green text, then tweak from there.  Poke around in the other settings you have for yourself on Ubuntu - any default keyboard shortcuts, etc. will be in .profile or .bash_profile, and those can be copied into the same folder on your Mac. If you want to get really picky you can even install Ubuntu Mono (the default Ubuntu terminal font) on your Mac, and use it as the default font for Terminal.  <comment297205> Possible duplicate of [Can I make my Mac OS X Terminal color items according to syntax, like the Ubuntu terminal?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9821/can-i-make-my-mac-os-x-terminal-color-items-according-to-syntax-like-the-ubuntu) <comment297209> I saw that but it does not answer several questions like what are the colors used by Ubuntu. I do not just what syntax highlighting enabled. I want it to be nearly identical. Also do not have enough reputation to make a comment on that post. <comment297229> Then edit your own question, link to that post including salient points, & make your question 'the rest of what you need to know' <comment297255> @Tetsujin I hope my new edit has made things easier to understand. Thanks for the suggestion.
