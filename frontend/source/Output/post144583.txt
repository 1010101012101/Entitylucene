"Movie not loaded" error when viewing Flash movie in any browser <body> When I view a flash movie that's embedded in a page in FF 23, Safari 7.0.3, or Chrome 37, I see a black screen where the movie should be.  When I right click on the movie, I get a "movie not loaded" error.  I've got Flash 14.0.0.177 installed according to this, and the clouds are moving under the "5. Verify if Flash Player is installed" section: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html  Anybody know how to fix this?  Guessing it's an OS-level thing since the behavior is the same in all browsers.  EDIT:  Here is an example page where this occurs:  http://time.com/3265308/ikea-catalog-2015   <comment170313> sorry, where is your movie coming from ? your hard drive or outside source. You say embedded? where is it embedded? FF should be at ver 32. <comment170314> Give us a web site example with embedded movie to cross check. <comment170457> If you are using Chrome and that doesn't work, the problem is most likely due to the website as Chrome uses its own builtin Flash Player. <comment170467> Here's an example: http://time.com/3265308/ikea-catalog-2015/
