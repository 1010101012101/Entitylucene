Can't partition startup disk in Mavericks for Boot Camp <body> I recently upgraded my computer to Mavericks (I believe I have the latest version, 10.9) and I've been trying for 2 days now to install Windows via Boot Camp on my computer, but it always fails at the Partitioning step.  I have tried multiple different things, such as…  ul liPartitioning via Disk Utility/li liGoing into the Recovery HD and trying to repair the HD/li licode/fsck/sbin -fy/code in Single-User mode/li liI have used a Mountain Lion USB install to use the Disk Utility there/li /ul  …but I keep ending up with the same errors:  ul liPartition map is broken/li liVerification of the file system failed/li /ul  When I try to repair it using Recovery HD I keep getting "Live file system repair is not supported" and there is basically no way for me to partition, unless I want to downgrade to another version of OS X which I don't feel like doing. Any ideas?  <answer112045> This indicates that the partition map on the drive is corrupt and needs to be repaired.  ol liBackup all your data (possibly with a disk image of your startup disk partition) and boot into a separate disk (not Recovery HD)./li liSelect your drive in Disk Utility, and choose the Partition tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hZwsw.png" height="60" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uZRdI.png" height="60"/li liChange Partition Layout to strong1 Partition/strong or strong2 Partitions/strong. This will erase the entire disk, replacing the corrupt partition map with a new one./li liClick Apply./li /ol  <answer114786> I solved this without erasing my harddrive by just booting into single-user mode and repairing the actual Macintosh HD Partition, instead of the whole harddrive.  <comment131622> would booting into a mountain lion usb installer work? <comment131625> @SimonAndersson Yes it should <comment131626> also what's the best way to backup my data if i don't have an external harddrive? :S the biggest USB i have is 32 gigabytes <comment131628> @SimonAndersson This process will erase all data from your drive, but if you're lacking space, don't back up data you don't need (e.g. /System as they'd be replaced when you reinstall OS X).
