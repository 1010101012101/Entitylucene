How do I unset an IP address set with ifconfig? <body> I recently used codeifconfig en1 1.2.3.4/code to set the IP address of a network interface (specifically, the wireless card) on a Mac… How can I remove/unset it?  Using the graphical network configuration tool doesn't seem to change (or even be aware of) this address - when I use it to manually set an address, a second address is added to the device.  For example, right now codeifconfig/code shows:  precodeen1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether 00:23:xx:xx:xx:xx      inet 192.168.141.99 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.141.255     inet 192.168.1.112 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255     media: autoselect     status: active /code/pre  The first address -  code141.99/code - is the address I manually set. The second address — code1.112/code — is the address assigned by my network's DHCP server.  <answer25905> I believe a reboot should reset it.  <answer25906> Try:  precodesudo ifconfig en1 down sudo ifconfig en1 up /code/pre  <answer25913> Sounds like you are looking to change the device en1 from 'static' to 'dhcp'. To do this perform the following:   precodesudo ifconfig set en1 BOOTP sudo ifconfig set en1 DHCP /code/pre  After making the config changes you will need to bring that interface down and back up:  precodesudo ifconfig en1 down sudo ifconfig en1 up /code/pre  <answer25939> Use codedelete/code:  precodeifconfig en1 delete 192.168.141.99 /code/pre  <answer120613> Try :  precodeifconfig en* down detach delete  /code/pre  <answer223435> To clear all ip address associated with en1:  precodesudo ifconfig en1 0.0.0.0 /code/pre  <comment29443> Sorry, but this doesn't work — the address persists past the down/up. <comment29452> Did you ifconfig en1 back to your original address? If you didn't then it's obviously going to be the same one you had changed it to. <comment29484> Which version of ifconfig uses that syntax? The manpage for ifconfig on my machine (10.6.7) mentions nothing of either a `set` action or `dhcp`. <comment29485> That might. But I'd rather leave it than sit through a reboot :P <comment29486> Sorry, my original question wasn't as clear as it could be. There was no “original address” - normally I have addresses assigned via DHCP, which now adds a second address to the interface. <comment140631> Please could you expand this answer to explain what the various flags and options are doing? <comment140646> and why does this work and other answers do not? <comment242685> This didn't work for me, I had to do `ifconfig en1 del 192.168.141.99` on Ubuntu. Hope it helps someone. <comment315487> @Frodik What's the difference? <comment324587> I confirm that this worked for me.
