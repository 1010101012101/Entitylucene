Homebrew: change name of group ownership in /usr/local/ so admins and standard users can brew <body> I have a local admin user and a few "network" mobile users (without codeadmin/code privileges) who need to be able to codebrew/code on a Mac. So, these 'network' users are not members of the group codeadmin/code and probably shouldn't be.   precode$ ls -l /user/local  -rw-r--r--   1 localadmin  admin   491 Jan 21 18:04 CONTRIBUTING.md drwxr-xr-x   6 localadmin  admin   204 Jan 21 18:23 Cellar drwxr-xr-x   8 localadmin  admin   272 Jan 21 18:06 Library -rw-r--r--   1 localadmin  admin   789 Jan 21 18:04 README.md drwxr-xr-x  44 localadmin  admin  1496 Jan 23 23:44 bin drwxr-xr-x   3 localadmin  admin   102 Jan 21 18:06 etc drwxr-xr-x  27 localadmin  admin   918 Jan 21 18:24 include drwxr-xr-x  98 localadmin  admin  3332 Jan 21 18:24 lib drwxr-xr-x   6 localadmin  admin   204 Jan 21 18:24 opt drwxr-xr-x   9 localadmin  admin   306 Jan 21 18:24 share drwx------   3 localadmin  admin   102 Jan 21 18:37 var /code/pre  My question is would there be a problem with, say, changing the group from codeadmin/code to something like codebrewers/code for code/usr/local -R/code (recurseively)? Then add coderoot/code, codelocaladmin/code and each network user to the codebrewers/code group. Would each network user now be able to codebrew/code?   I have read that I might need to change the codeumask/code for each network user to code0002/code?  <answer90571> This can work if you also then make code/usr/local//code and everything under it group-writable with codechmod/code. The current permissions have them writable only by localadmin.  Yes, you will need to do something about the codeumask/code for users running codebrew/code. Otherwise users won't be able to modify stuff brewed by other users, even if they're both in the codebrewers/code group. You probably don't want to change their default codeumask/code, because then emall/em the files they create would be group-writable, which is probably not what you want. You might use a custom wrapper script around the codebrew/code command which sets the codeumask/code to 002 for just the duration of that command, e.g. by doing the codeumask/code and codebrew/code calls in a subshell.
