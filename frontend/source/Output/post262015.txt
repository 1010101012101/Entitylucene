How to recover Pages/Numbers after install Sierra from scratch <body> I had mac book with El Capitan with included Pages/Numbers/etc.  Due to some reasons, I create bootable usb drive and installed Sierra from scratch. And now Pages/Numbers are missing.  In App Store there is only possibility to buy them, not to download back.  <comment328180> Are you signed into the App Store with the same credentials? The apps belong to the Apple ID not the computer. <comment328185> @Tetsujin yes, I've logged in App Store with the same account <comment328205> If so, just press buy and the App Store will probably realize that you have already bought the software and let you download it for free. <comment328216> @jksoegaard actually, it required to update payment info, and as I can see - to charge money <comment328270> Can you find it in your purchased list? If so, get it from there instead. <comment328308> @Tetsujin no, they are missed in that list. I've got them built in when bought Mac book <comment328398> I would double-check that you are actually using the same apple-id as you did when you first installed Pages/Number on that MacBook <comment328406> @jksoegaard actually, I did not install them manually. I opened new macbook, enter my credentials for single apple ID, that I have. And all those apps where installed.
