Switch between playlists but ensure that songs are not repeated <body> I'm putting together a few different music playlists for a friend's wedding and I'd like to ensure that if we switch from one playlist to another and then back to the original playlist that no tracks are repeated when playing the original playlist a second time. Does that make sense? Any suggestions on how to achieve this? Thanks!
