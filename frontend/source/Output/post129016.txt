How to restore the computer's username in Terminal? <body> I would like to restore the previous name (default) in my terminal. How can I do that?   I changed to $ sign only by applying this code:  precodeecho "export PS1='$ '" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile . ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  but couldn't manage to restore it.  <answer129028> Simply remove the line you appended to your ~/.bash_profile and restart your shell.  <answer129035> Simply enter  precodenano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  then go to the line  precodeexport PS1='$ ' /code/pre  and delete that line. Then save the file and exit nano. After then execute  precode. ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  That will be load the settings from this file.  <comment151042> When you say name, are you talking about showing the username in the prompt or title of the terminal window?   Have you tried running bash with the --noprofile flag set?  If you could show an example of what you are trying to do that would be great.
