Does AirDrop require some special hardware or setup to work? <body> My workplace issued me some Apple devices. When I am at work, connected to the workplace WiFi, I am able to AirDrop files between the devices. But when I am at home, connected to my own home WiFi, the AirDrop icons disappear on the devices. Does AirDrop require some special router or other hardware for it to work?  <comment339177> Could you list what devices you have got?
