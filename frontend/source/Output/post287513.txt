Podcast Syncing between iPhone, iPad and Macbook Pro not consistent <body> As the title says, I have three devices and listen to podcasts daily. I have all set to remove played episodes. I am having a number of specific problems:  ol liPosition doesn't always sync (e.g. I listen to 43 minutes of a podcast and my iPad shows it unplayed./li liI finish listening to an episode in the car on the iPhone and the iPad shows it as unplayed./li liEpisodes in iTunes on the Macbook Pro show up as Saved completely randomly! I have noticed that this happens most with new episodes./li liMy iPad and iPhone still have the episodes on them that have been played on the laptop.  They do not get deleted for ages (even though they're set to delete) and create a lot of clutter./li /ol  I should note that all devices are signed into the same iCloud account.
