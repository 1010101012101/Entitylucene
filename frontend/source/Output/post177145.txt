Why do photos I try to send from my iPad not arrive? <body> Why do photos I 'send' from my iPad not reach their destination, even though the device makes a whooshing noise and look as if it's sent it?  <comment209401> How are you sending them (mail, iMessage etc.)? Where are you sending them to? If mail, do normal mails from the iPad arrive? <comment209402> What is the size of the photos files ? <comment209710> Not very big - I have a programme to downsize them (Tekunodo), so I always do that first. It's set at 640. <comment209713> Patrix; I have no problem in posting to Facebook, but I can't see how to attach them to an e-mail, so I call up the photo and click on the icon top right. A page appears onto which I can address the mail and add a message. I then click 'send' and it disappears with a whooshing sound, which I assumed meant it had been sent, but it doesn't arrive!
