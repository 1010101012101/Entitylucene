MacBook Pro mid2010 SSD optibay upgrade - SandForce? <body> I want to replace Superdrive in my MBP mid 2010 with Otpibay SSD.  I have 2nd revision (rev 2/rev B) of mother board replaced due to GPU problems.  Which drive should I consider? I would like to omit 1.5Gbps problem and have some TRIM/Garbage Collector. I wont spend to much money.   I'm thinking about:  ol liIntel 520 120GB - SLI SandForce/li liKingston HyperX 3K SSD 120GB - SLI SandForce/li liIntel 330 120GB - SLI SandForce/li liSamsung 840 Pro 128GB (TLC) - MDX/li liSamsung 840 120GB (TLC) - MDX/li /ol  Should I worry about SandForce in Optibay?
