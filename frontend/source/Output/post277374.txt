Activity Monitor on Mac OS doesn't show port 8080 <body> I'm trying to verify that a specified process (server) listens on port strong8080/strong using strongActivity Monitor/strong. But, for some strange reason, Activity Monitor doesn't show information about port numbers stronggreater than 25XX/strong. I do know that the server works fine and listens on this port.  How can I see the process which listens on port 8080 in Activity Monitor?  <answer277468> You can't do it easily in Activity Monitor but it emis/em easy at the command line. codelsof -i :8080/code in the Terminal will display the command and process ID of the process listening on port 8080.
