Invoke Keyboard Shortcut <body> Is it possible to invoke a keyboard shortcut from applescript?  For example I like to run the F11 keyboard shortcut.  <answer171245> Do you mean open the applescript from keyboard shortcut? if so, then follow this to convert the applescript into an app, then create a Service using Automator.  ul liAppleScript to App/li liOpen Apps from keyboard shortcut/li /ul  Hope this helps.  <answer171439> The following works from the terminal.  precodeosascript -e "tell applications \"System Events\"" -e "key code 100" -e "end tell" /code/pre  Alternatively I believe this should work.  precodetell application "System Events"     key code 101 end tell /code/pre  Googling mac osx system events key code should bring up several options.  <comment201475> For example I have "Show Desktop" set to f11 key.  I would like to invoke the f11 key for AppleScript. <comment201669> Like I mentioned in my answer. You cannot open files with a keyboard shortcut like on Windows, but on Mac it'll open Apps. Therefore you have to convert the AppleScript to an app, then create a keyboard shortcut service. From then the keyboard shortcut should be accessible anytime. <comment201672> Small typo "I would like to invoke keyboard shorcut from AppleScript" I have left a response that works.
