Do not disturb by time per application <body> Is there any way to disable notification only with specific application(s) for a certain time strong(not permanently)/strong? Something like Do Not Disturb, but for specific application(s). Or maybe even by notification banners?   Usually I need this for disable notifications for skype or other messenger apps for hour, so that I won't forget to turn notifications back on.  <comment273984> iOS doesn't have this feature yet, but maybe a third-party app does?
