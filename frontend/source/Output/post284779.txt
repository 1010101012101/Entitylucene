Saving a .docx reverts web links to text in WordPad <body> CMD-k lets me put a hyperlink in my .docx (in TextEdit)  However if I save and reopen the file, it has disappeared.  If instead I select a word and then repeat the process (so that the word appears blue and clicks through to the URL), now the word has changed to plaintext.  Is this a bug? It can't be right, surely!  Amazingly Google doesn't bring anything up. Surely someone else must have bumped into this problem!  EDIT: I tried using 1Doc instead, same problem!
