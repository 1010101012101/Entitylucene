Instruments Not Able to Launch the iOS 8.1 Simulator Unless it is Pre-Selected Manually <body> My UI Tests running in Instruments not able to launch the iOS 8.1 Simulator unless the Device is manually selected.  For Example, if I have 'iPad 2' as my current selected device, trying to launch 'iPhone 6' through UI Scripts doesn't launch Simulator. It fails with a "waiting for device to boot" and it fails with a timeout.  But if I select iPhone 6 manually or pre-selected scripts running fine.
