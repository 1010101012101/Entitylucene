Google Chrome Helper Using Up Too Much Memory <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D1FQs.png" alt="enter image description here"  Google Chrome Helper is appearing in Activity Monitor a dozen times and overall using a ton of memory.  How do I curtail this?  Most advice columns say to go to my plugins and check "Play on click", but Google updated the browser and this option is no longer available.  What can I do?  <answer278437> strongEvery "Helper" is either a tab, a subframe, a core Chrome process or an extension./strongbr You could reduce RAM usage by uninstalling extensions, or just using less tabs.  <comment345349> Each "helper" is an open web page/tab. None of those are truly excessive, though definitely a bit heavy. Chrome is a well-known [anecdotally] memory-hog. Your 'fix' is to not leave tabs open if you aren't using them, unless you have sufficient RAM to spare. <comment345431> Is there another way?  How can 1 tab be using half a gig of memory?  That makes 0 sense! <comment345441> idk, but they do. I have tabs open here varying between 50MB & 1GB. Google's 'helpers' don't actually help you much as they don't include the URL. If you try the same in Safari you can at least see which tab is using the most [or site, as the URL is just the top level]. <comment345868> Access the Chrome task manager: **More** (icon on top right)  **More Tools**  **Task Manager** to see which of your tabs are using memory and where you can also end process for tab.
