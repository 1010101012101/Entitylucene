Lost file when moving it to a "All My Files" Finder window <body> By mistake, I moved a file in to a Finder window that I previously did a search in, so it was open on "All My Files" which is not really a folder.  Yet when I moved the file in to this Finder window, the file disappeared from its original location.  Now when I search for the file I cannot find it..  What happened to it?  <answer55762> The file most assuredly ended up in your home directory somewhere.  I was able to replicate your problem and the file I dropped there ended up in my codeDocuments/code directory.    If you don't see it in codeDocuments/code, try searching for the file by name with Spotlight. Lastly, if that doesn't work, try issuing the following command in Terminal.app:  precodefind $HOME -name "filename" /code/pre  <comment64001> A great thing to do after a slip-up like that is CMD-z ( undo ).   You'd be surprised at how many instances undo can be used.  I know it doesn't help much now :( <comment64002> Do you know the name of the file? <comment64003> Yes I know the name of the file, I mentioned that I was searching for the file.. <comment64004> It took me a few times to replicate it.  The file I dropped into "All My Files" ended up in `~/Documents`. *Spotlight found it just fine*. <comment64005> Thanks @ephsmith, I see the file there, I guess my spotlight isn't configured to search there...  Please make a answer so that I can mark it as correct! <comment64006> Sometimes I hate apple.. <comment64007> This shouldn't have happened and I think it's a bug or unforeseen side-effect.  Undo is a good thing to have your hands remember though.  I use it all the time--closing the wrong tab in Safari., moving the wrong file.  When I make a mistake, CMD-z is usually the first thing I try.
