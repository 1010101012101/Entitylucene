Username.conf rules to fix 403 error <body> I am setting up a webserver but I am currently receiving a 403 error when browsing to Localhost. I am setting up "username.conf" and I have a couple of questions:  ol liSince I am not logged in as a user that is not the admin, do I need to rename the username.conf file to the specific user's name?/li liThe path can be something custom like this?  precode&lt;Directory "/Users/niccolomineo/Creative Cloud Files/dev/"&gt; /code/pre/li /ol  This is what is reported in the log  precode[Sat Aug 02 16:30:34.481180 2014] [autoindex:error] [pid 392] [client ::1:49541] AH01276: Cannot serve directory /Library/WebServer/Documents/: No matching DirectoryIndex (index.html) found, and server-generated directory index forbidden by Options directive /code/pre  Clearly, for some reason, the path he's trying to serve is still the default one, but I specified a custom one. It is like I cannot override it. How can I fix this?  <answer140785> Create the file code/etc/apache2/users/niccolomineo.conf/code and copy the following into the file...  precode&lt;Directory "/Users/niccolomineo/Creative Cloud Files/dev/"&gt;     Options Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  Then restart apache codesudo apachectl restart/code and you should find your pages at codehttp://localhost/~niccolomineo/code.  <comment165875> If you try http://localhost/~niccolomineo in a browser what happens? <comment165919> It says: Forbidden - You don't have permission to access /~niccolomineo on this server. <comment165920> I am with Apache 2.4.9 (Yosemite 10.10), so the rules are slightly different. I know how to do that part. What I don't understand is why it doesn't work. It only works when I change the path straight inside the httpd.conf. <comment165928> Also, when I change the path, it works when I browse to localhost (not when I browse to localhost/~niccolomineo). <comment165929> What are the permissions on the niccolomineo.conf file? They should be something like "-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  144 2 Aug 00:00 niccolomineo.conf'. <comment165930> Also search https.conf for the phrase "userdir". There should be two instances. One for the mod_userdir.so library and one for the httpd-userdir.conf file. If either has a hash before it, remove it.
