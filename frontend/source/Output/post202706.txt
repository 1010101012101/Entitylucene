Need an OSX cd to reset admin password <body> Issue - father in-law has alzheimers (early but impacting) Wants files from Apple laptop and can't remember password(s) Shop who set it up for him wants $$$s to unlock and reset and I said what a lot of BS, but they didn't supply an OS disk with the machine so can I (or he if there is something he can do) get an OS disk to reset the admin password? PS. This is a first time foray for me into the world of Apples - he wants the "family tree" files..... Any ideas - inbetween times we are scouring bits of paper with notes and old passwords etc..... D.  <answer202708> You do not need a cd or dvd. That shop could have done you a solid and shown you single user mode.   Power off the Mac. Hold command S and follow the article below up to the two commands: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT2600  precodefsck -fy /   mount -uw /   /code/pre  Then do these two commands exactly as written - spaces and punctuation count:  precoderm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone halt /code/pre  Power up your Mac and then make a new account with a name like "rescue admin". This account can be used to reset the passwords of any other accounts.   <answer202747> Although the bmike's answer will probably work, I suggest to try something more leightweight first. This article describes the procedure:  ol liBoot your Mac's Recovery Partition by pressing kbdcmd/kbd+kbdr/kbd at startup/li liGo to codeUtilities/code  codeTerminal/code/li liEnter coderesetpassword/code/li liIn the GUI select the disk and user and enter a new password./li liPress codeSave/code. (Reset of home directory should not be necessary)/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rvmna.png" alt="Reset Password Tool"  <comment244574> Whoa @bmike! You are giving dangerous advice to an obvious newbie... <comment244575> What's dangerous @n1000 about the steps that Apple Documents? The OP is clearly astute enough about computers to know to not pay an opportunistic repair shop. <comment244576> :) Maybe you should add a notice that `rm` is quite dangerous, especially in  single user mode <comment244585> What version of OSX are you using? <comment244591> If you can't tell what version of OSX you have, it might also be helpful if you can tell us about the MacBook. Does it have a DVD drive built in?
