Using a script, how do I force a MacBook Air to connect to a specific wireless network if it is in range <body> Our school gave our student MacBook airs. They are admins and allowed to take it home. I was wondering if there is a way to run a script that forces the computer to connect to our school wifi if its available. They tend to connect to free open networks to get around our proxy. They current have 10.11.  <comment348065> If they are admins, they have the power to override anything you set.
