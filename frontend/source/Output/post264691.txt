Is it possible to automatically switch between scrolling? <body> So I have this logitech mouse that I use with my Macbook Pro. I've been using it for a week now and I just CAN'T get used to the inverse scrolling direction on the mouse wheel. So I decided to change it in my System Preferences, since I can't automatically change it in the Logitech mouse software. But sometimes when I can't use my mouse I have to use my trackpad, and getting used to the "natural" scrolling is annoying.  So, is there a way to make my macbook automatically change the scrolling direction depending if I'm using my trackpad and my mouse? Or does anyone know if theres a script that I can use, I'm ok with just using it on my Dock. I already have a script for clearing my clipboard  <answer264722> In the case of using an Apple Magic Mouse with my MacBook Pro I found that when I changed the setting for 'Scrolling Direction: Natural' by turning it off in the Mouse settings, that the same setting is also changed in the Trackpad settings.  Searching on this site I found this post which provides a link to software which allows you to set separate settings for your mouse and trackpad.  <answer264742> When I can, I prefer my own home-rolled solution to adding more third party software and if you want to toggle the emstate/em of the strongScroll direction: natural/strong emcheckbox/em, which is a emglobal setting/em and found under both the strongMouse/strong and the strongTrackpad/strong preference panes, under strongPoint &amp; Click/strong, in strongSystem Preferences/strong, you can use the following AppleScript emcode/em saved as an emapplication/em and then place it in the strongDock/strong via emdrag and drop/em.  ul liNote that because this is a emglobal setting/em, it doesn't matter whether you check/uncheck from either the strongMouse/strong or the strongTrackpad/strong preference panes and as such I've coded this to target the strongMouse/strong preference pane as it should have the emcheckbox/em even when a strongTrackpad/strong isn't present./li /ul  I saved the following AppleScript emcode/em in strongScript Editor/strong as an application named: strongToggle Natural Scrolling/strong  hr  precodeon run     try         tell application "System Preferences"             set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.mouse"             activate         end tell         tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"             tell radio button 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 to if value is 0 then click             set cbValue to value of (click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1)         end tell         tell application "System Preferences" to quit         tell me             activate             if cbValue is equal to 1 then                 -- display dialog "Natural scrolling is now active." buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Toggle Natural Scrolling" giving up after 3                 display notification "Natural scrolling is now active."             else                 -- display dialog "Natural scrolling is no longer active." buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Toggle Natural Scrolling" giving up after 3                 display notification "Natural scrolling is no longer active."             end if         end tell     on error eStr number eNum         activate         display dialog eStr &amp; " number " &amp; eNum buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Toggle Natural Scrolling" with icon caution     end try end run /code/pre  hr  As presently coded the codedisplay dialog/code emcommands/em are commented out and are there because I originally wrote this under OS X 10.8.5, which doesn't support the codedisplay notification/code emcommand/em, however I've also tested (some of the emcode/em) under macOS 10.12 and why the codedisplay notification/code emcommand/em is being used. I've left both in the emcode/em since I do not know which version you're running and you can comment/uncomment accordingly.  Under OS X 10.9 and later, you will need to add the strongToggle Natural Scrolling/strong to Accessibility, under Privacy, under Security &amp; Privacy preferences, in System Preferences. If you don’t, you’ll get the following error when running it:     Toggle Natural Scrolling is not allowed assistive access. number -1719   <comment331797> Which mouse is it? Perhaps more importantly, what software came with it? I've got a Logitech trackpad (and keyboard) and the software for them is "Logitech Options" - if you've installed it it'll appear in the bottom row of your Preferences. My trackpad has an option for "Scroll direction" - your mouse may, too. Note that I also have a Logitech trackball that *doesn't* use Logitech Options, so YMMV! (Responded as a comment because (a) this isn't really an answer, and (b) I don't know yet if it's useful info).
