How do I revert iTunes contact sync? <body> I first upgraded my operating system (Windows Vista) and then iTunes.  During the upgrade, I accidentally chose contact syncing should prefer my Windows' contacts over my iPhone's contacts. Now I've lost my phone's contact directory.  How do I revert the iTunes contact sync so I can get my iPhone contacts back?  <answer54412> I'm Michael and I work for connex.io, an address book app.  You can probably retrieve your contacts by taking the following steps:  ol liOn your iPhone go to Settings - iCloud/li liand disable ‘Contacts’/li /ol  They should re-appear.

Are they stored/backuped in any other place at all?
