Quicktime Screen Recording doesn't work in Lion <body> When starting a new Screen Recording in Quicktime Player in Lion 10.7.3, as soon as I click record I get this following error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPTQ1.png" alt="quicktime error"  Here's a video demonstrating the issue: http://db.tt/CROyXgIt  Here are the settings under the triangle on the right:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6dEh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer46717> Finally figured it out - apparently the Movies folder in my home directory had a weird permission set on it and things couldn't be written to it, which caused QuickTime to give a very descriptive message "The operation could not be completed" and saving to a different folder (or after fixing the permissions on Movies), worked.  <answer210653> FWIW, I ran into this issue today and the problem was with the external monitor. After unplugging the Apple Display, I was able to see the phone screen output fine.  <answer247216> Simply restarting my mac worked for me.  <comment53409> Works fine for me. Just putting that out there. <comment53410> May I ask, though, what's the input-bar-type thing between the O and N of operation? Also, there's usually correct punctuation in Apple's error messages (i.e. "The operation could not be completed." with a period). What's up? <comment53416> The input-bar-type thing is just a cursor that appears if you click on the message. the message isn't editable or anything, though. When I take a screenshot, the main quicktime window disappears, even with a full screenshot - http://i.imgur.com/Lokhm.png?1 (that screenshot shows you can select text with the cursor thing) <comment53419> Huh, never seen that before. OK! <comment53433> @penguinrob What are your settings under the triangle on the right? <comment53434> @KyleCronin added to the question <comment53435> @penguinrob Hm, nothing unusual there. This is pretty bizarre. Maybe try creating a new user account and seeing if you still get the problem there? If you do, maybe it's a HDCP issue with the monitor you're using, but I'm otherwise at a loss here. <comment53437> @KyleCronin Just tried it in a guest account and it works great. <comment57378> Don't forget to mark your question as answered ! <comment254175> What did you set the permissions to? <comment254217> @nipponese The permissions were set to "Read only" for my user account, so I changed it to "Read & Write" for my account in the Finder Get Info window, and then I could save to it. <comment354399> doesn't work, permission «Read & Write», macOS: 10.12.4, QuickTime Player: 10.4, iOS: 10.3.1
