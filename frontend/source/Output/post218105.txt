Is it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD? <body> I need to run Visual Studio on my MacBook Pro and I need Windows to do that. The easiest and well known way to install Windows on a Mac is by running the Boot Camp app on the Mac and let it do what's necessary. The problem is that I don't want to partition the Internal SSD so the remaining option is to install Boot Camp Windows 10 on an External Drive and boot it every time I need it by plugging in my external USB 3.0 HDD. Is this achievable?  <answer218115> Yes, you can do it. The instructions are originally for Windows 8. Some terminal commands might be a little different for Windows 10.  You will need :  ol liWindows 10 x64 ISO file/li lia running Windows installation real or virtualised/li lia blank external hard drive/li liApple Bootcamp drivers (obtained from the BootCamp setup) on USB key/li liMicrosoft AIK/li /ol  h2Format and prepare external drive/h2  ol lilaunch the CMD line tool (click on the Start menu, in the search bar type CMD, then launch it)/li litype codeDISKPART/code /li litype codeLIST DISK/code It will list all drives (codeDISK 0 ; DISK 1; DISK # ;/code etc...)/li liChoose the disk you want Windows installed onto and type accordingly codeSELECT DISK #/code (code#/code being the number of the disk you want to use (e.g. codeSELECT DISK 2/code)/li liType codeLIST DISK/code again, and you will see a code*/code in front of the disk to be erased./li liType codeCLEAN/code/li liType codeCREATE PARTITION PRIMARY/code/li liType codeSELECT PARTITION 1/code/li liType codeACTIVE/code/li liType codeFORMAT FS=NTFS QUICK/code/li liType codeASSIGN/code/li liType codeEXIT/code or close the window/li /ol  h2Install Windows with AIK/h2  ol liinstall AIK/li liMount the Windows 10 ISO image as a drive.

OS X 10.11.4 open Bootcamp Utility and   Action  Download Windows Support Software  Disk Utility to prepare external T2 SSD as exFAT, then run Windows Support Software. Select your external drive. Then Bootcamp Utility would pick up where your manual preparation ended, and install a Bootcamp Windows 10 on the external drive. Or it might install internal. Try it. See what your hardware supports. Bootcamp quickly removes accidents, or Disk Utility "-" delete and First Aid.  SIP may not support Windows 8 external Bootcamp. and older hardware.

SIP is helping to make Bootcamp more fluid than it used to be.  <answer239203> Here's an updated procedure for Windows 10, based on orkoden's excellent answer.  I tested this process on a MacBookPro11,1 running OS X 10.11.5 (15F34). Throughout the process, directly connect all devices to your Mac. I found that certain operations failed more frequently if I used the USB hub in my monitor.  In addition to the external drive that will host your Windows installation (the "destination drive"), you will need another USB drive (the "driver drive") to temporarily store the Boot Camp drivers.  I used these parts:  ul liDestination drive: Samsung T3 Portable 500GB USB 3.0 External SSD (MU-PT500B/AM)/li liDriver drive: SanDisk Extreme 32GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive (SDCZ80-032G-GAM46)/li /ul  Here are the steps:  ol liInstall VMware Fusion 8.1.1 from VMware's site  ul liThe non-professional free evaluation version is sufficient/li liVMware Fusion 7.1.3 couldn’t connect my external USB disk to my Windows VM/li liI downloaded VMware-Fusion-8.1.1-3771013.dmg (SHA256: 29cad381a36374e58a85fb58f7aaad8cae41ad50ef07fdda0db6d782c95c0a95)/li /ul/li liDownload the Windows 10 ISO file from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO  ul liI chose Windows 10, English, 64-bit/li liI downloaded Win10_1511_1_English_x64.iso (SHA256: cf5cff9e23c853fed769cf382e18b29889dcc0055b69226f0164ab51eca3069c)/li /ul/li liDownload the Windows 7 Automated Installation Kit from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5753  ul liI downloaded KB3AIK_EN.iso (SHA256: c6639424b2cebabff3e851913e5f56410f28184bbdb648d5f86c05d93a4cebba)/li /ul/li liPrepare the driver drive.  ol liRun diskutil list to determine the device name.

If you have Parallels or VMWare simply get hold of two free Windows Utilities, miniTools (to format and set up the external drive) and WintoUSB.    Put the ISO of Windows 10 or 8.1 into the VM as you will need this when installing with WintoUSB. I've done this about 30 times already, and  never had a problem.  Using miniTools is the hardest part and that is simple once you figure it out.    It's best to format the new drive with the Mac as ExFAT first.  Once you mount this in Parallels and run miniTools simply make the first partition (the small one you will see) Fat32 and make it primary and Active.    The second large partition make NTFS and primary also.    Once this is done WintoUSB is simple to use, select the ISO then the new external and check the EFI and main partitions as the destination.    That's it. I run Paragons NTFS utility on my Mac so I can write to an NTFS disk this way I can copy all the things I need such as Bootcamp drivers, AMD drivers are whatever from the Mac but if you just boot (hold option on start up) to the new disk it will install drivers in Windows itself.    I bought Windows 10 from Amazon (Home Edition) and every one of these I make is automatically authorized as licensed by Microsoft without any problem.  The caveat is only to the same Mac (in my case a new Mac Pro).  BTW I can do all this above with El Capitan and macOS Sierra (I have a dev account at Apple).  <answer246341> This is basically Alex Lambert's answer from above with a a few updates.  You don't need the Automated Installation Kit, you can use commands which are in the ISO. And the codeinstall.wim/code file is no longer included in the ISO so I've added the steps to convert the codeinstall.esd/code into codeinstall.wim/code.  Here are my updates to his post above:  You don't need AIK so delete step 3, step 5.3, and step 6.1.  Here is the updated 6.2 with chrishiestand's correction.  6.2  ol liPrepare the destination drive: /li liRun codediskpart/code/li liPlug in the destination drive.

In my case, the letter was codeE/code./li liRun: codeexit/code/li /ol  Do step 6.3 to mount the ISO to the VM.  Here's my update to step 6.4:  ol liYou’ll need to convert the codeinstall.esd/code file to codeinstall.wim/code./li liCopy coded:\sources\install.esd/code to somewhere on your hard drive (I used the Documents folder)./li liCopy coded:\sources\dism.exe/code to the same directory./li liGet details about what images are inside the ESD file with the following command.

I really appreciate everyone posting as it got me very close and was able to figure out the couple other steps to get this working and wanted to post them here to help the next person trying this process.  <answer255489> Start From Scratch &amp; Please Follow Step By Step For the best use of     these steps , i suggest you google each one before you start !! aka     gather some info (Hardware Requirements).  ol liWindows Computer installed and working  (XP/2000 -Vista - 7 -  8 - 10 -VM).  /li liObviously a Mac computer with OS X10.10  and above  /li liExternal Hard-Disk 32 Gb or More ./li li4GB USB Key .

I can install windows but after booting to the external windows disk it always hangs before finishing booting windows. <comment293109> SIP shouldn't make a big difference in this case since I don't believe it prevents writing to the boot sector of an external disk. Also, Boot Camp Assistant will not allow you to install windows on an external drive; it only gives you the option of the internal drive.  The Two Canoes article is quite interesting and perhaps it gives some clues about how we could get this working. <comment293287> @chrishiestand: What is the exact model/year/screen size of your Mac?

Your steps are pretty much the same as @orkoden's above but I do like the `/check /verify` addition to the imagex command. Unfortunately I'm unable to reproduce your success tonight. I may have a problem with my USB3 - sata adapter (Thermaltake BlackX 5g) - or perhaps it's an issue with the USB3 controller on my MBP. I keep losing the connection to the disk both when I boot Windows and in Parallels/VMWare. In any case, I'll need to borrow some known good equipment before I can figure out if this works. <comment293942> I tried again on an external USB drive and it worked. So it was either my SSD or (more likely I think) the Thermaltake BlacX 5G usb3 adapter that was dropping the connection <comment294116> @chrishiestand and Alex: I was able to verify most your procedure. The largest problem I had was with the `imagex.exe` command from the [Windows 7 Automated Installation Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5753). The command would not work with my Windows 10 `install.wim` file. I tried the command line you posted and few variations of my own, all with no success. After some research, I determined the `image.exe` command has been deprecated and is no longer supposed to work with Windows 10. <comment294119> @chrishiestand and Alex: I downloaded the [Windows 10 Assessment and Deployment Kit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/dn913721.aspx) and substituted the command `Dism /apply-image /imagefile:D:\sources\install.wim /index:1 /ApplyDir:E:\ /CheckIntegrity` for your posted command `imagex /check /verify /apply d:\sources\install.wim "Windows 10 Home" e:`. This substitution worked for me. The command `Dism.exe` is the new replacement for the deprecated `imagex.exe` command. This was not the only change I made to your procedure, but it was the most significant. <comment294277> @DavidAnderson yeah that makes sense. I ended up using both imagex and dism and they both seemed to work for me. But since dism is the newer one I agree it should be used instead. <comment299731> @chrishiestand and Alex: dism.exe is included in the Windows 10 iso. You do not have to download a Kit in order to execute the command. <comment300413> I can't get this to work either, when I reboot my MAC and hold the ALT key, I can't see the window Drive <comment301750> @matt95 This article may also be of assistance: https://www.58bits.com/blog/2016/01/31/installing-windows-10-external-usb-3-hard-drive-boot-camp <comment303218> Make sure your partition is the first on the disk, if not definitely set as the primary. I started off trying to use a 2nd partition, so I assume once you've got it working, you could resize and add a 2nd partion. Not sure how I could have made the 2nd primary, without starting again.  Also, when rebooting osx, it will miss the usb drive the first time, so you have to power down, and then boot again, holding alt. Something like it doesn't do a full reboot, and so doesn't pickup the drive.   After that it worked, but then auto updated gfx drivers, and seemed to brick the install. Turn off! <comment306295> Great tutorial. You can skip installing Windows on virtual machine as you can download prepared virtual machines from Microsoft:  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/ <comment309035> If you need to do this with the new tool, after imagex, its Dism /apply-image /imagefile:N:\Images\my-windows-partition.wim /index:1 /ApplyDir:C:\ https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824910.aspx and the image file is install.esd not install.wim <comment312353> If you have problems with Step 6.4, it's not surprising. `imagex.exe` has been deprecated since 2013 and depending on which `Dism` you happen to have on your system, @david_anderson's solution above may or may not work. Fix this by downloading `vdism` and save yourself the time, it will run the correct version of DISM your system requires and works flawlessly without the non-descript Microsoft-style errors. _Leave it to independent developers to provide what Microsoft should provide by default._ <comment317636> When trying to change the startup disk to my hard drive, it states `You can't change the startup disk to the selected disk; The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk.` I am using a volume on my external hard drive instead of the whole disk. Used `imagex.exe`. Anything? I used Disk Management to reformat the partition.

I had previously done this successfully for a drive connected to a Mac Mini and followed the same instructions. Not bootable. Used gdisk to convert to GPT just in case, still not bootable. Took existing functioning drive from the Mini and plugged it into the Pro, still not bootable. Trying to do it in system prefs as opposed to option at startup: `The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk.` :\ <comment332632> This should be marked as right answer. rest of the answers will fail to update windows 10 throwing `the disk layout for uefi firmware isn't supported ` <comment332734> huh! GPT conflict with vmware boot camp. <comment333307> Looks like MBR is the problem, 2015 and 2016 Macs can't boot MBR drives. <comment333670> @Aaron were you able to find a workaround / amendment to the instructions to make it work? <comment334719> @MikeyWard - not yet, doing some research this weekend. <comment335638> Tried a few things without success (installing Windows from a bootable installer, creating the drive as a Windows To Go installation utilizing a guaranteed GPT partition setup, modifying partition info with gdisk). Hope someone can figure it out :\ <comment337638> I'm on the same boat @Aaron and I'm starting to think that the problem comes with TB3 compatibility.... <comment337639> Did you try this on a 2016 rMBP or works only on 2015 models? <comment337647> Managed to get it to work with some fiddling. There are now solutions down below that work. The one mentioning wintousb enterprise and the one specifically mentioning 2015- MacBooks should work <comment337736> I have a mid 2015 rMBP, but it should work for newer MacBook models too. <comment337800> I have a 2016 rMBP and Sierra 12.2 and It worked for me! Thanks! <comment337802> @Aaron You were right, these two posts from below work perfectly! Thanks! <comment338802> I just got this to work with Sierra. It should be noted that I used the exact same SSD Alex used. I've tried in the past to install Windows 10 on an external drive and I'm not sure if the drive was the issue, but it failed twice with my other externals. The only thing I changed was I followed David Anderson's "dism..." replacement for "imagex" in the original instructions. I just ran it from a normal elevated command prompt. And as someone already mentioned, I didn't need to install the Assessment/Deployment kit as dism was already present on my machine. <comment340403> I tried this just now on my 2016 MacBook Pro (13" with Touch Bar). Neither the Trackpad, nor the keyboard (including the Touch Bar) were recognized during setup so I had to use an external keyboard to set it up. Also it hung quite a long time at 95% during the dism-step. Just be patient! <comment342284> Simple, Great ! I just had Windows 10 Pro w/o intall.wim file so just export it from eps and done! Working like charm and i do not have to have external keyboard.. But i suggest to download drivers from Boot Camp! Thanks again! <comment349092> Can someone highlight when do you use the Bootcamp drivers downloaded in first step? as it is not mentioned later on at all? <comment349250> @Gripsoft I've updated the answer :) <comment357429> Hello. I'm stuck at `BCDBOOT G:\WINDOWS /S G:` it gives me the following error: `BFSVC: Failed to create a new system store. Status = [c000003a]` I couldn't find anything meaningful on it. I'm setting up windows 10 using windows8.1 installation, could this be the reason? <comment360709> I had to cd to d:\sources for the dism step, otherwise I was getting `The system cannot find the file specified`, even though I was using `/imagefile:d:\sources\install.wim`
