Problem with mount_smbfs after Sierra update <body> In MacOS prior to Sierra, I had a shell script that mounted three shares from my WDMyCould server. Worked like a charm whenever I wanted the shares (almost always) I would just run it and it would create the three share mount points inside the /Volumes folder and then mount the shares there. (It shouldn't matter, but the three WD shares are "MyDocs", "Pictures" and "Public".)  In the post-Sierra environment, the script can no longer create the mount point folders inside of the "/Volumes? location. A "Permission denied" error is generated instead. If is use "sudo" I can manually create the "MyDocs" folder inside of /Volumes. But even then, if I try to use the original "mount_smbfs" command manually, I get a "Permission denied" error in response to that command.  What gives? Has Apple screwed with the file system permissions - yet again? And more importantly, what do I do to fix this?  BTW, the WD server shows up in Finder just as it always has. And if I click on it in Finder, it connects up without hesitation. And if I elect the Shared folders, they connect just as expected, and display the same exact way on the desktop as they did in the "good old days" when everything worked nicely.  Thanks a bunch to anyone who can offer any suggestion(s).  Jim A. Albuquerque, NM
