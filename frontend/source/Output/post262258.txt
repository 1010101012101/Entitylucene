Can you turn off auto-complete/auto-correct in mobile Safari? It's awful for SO <body> I have an iPad Pro with a Logitech keyboard. It is emalmost/em useable for day-to-day light work.  However, the auto-complete/auto-correct feature in mobile Safari is truly awful when posting to Stack Overflow. In particular, it keeps converting back-ticks (`) to abbreviations like "1st" or "10th". Is there a way to turn off auto-correct for a specific website?  I found several posts talking about how to disable auto-correct in the HTML of a website. I'm talking about as a user.   <answer262339> Yes, you can turn auto-correction off. But unfortunately not for specific apps or websites.   ul liOpen the settings app/li liGeneral  Keyboards/li liTurn Auto-Correction off/li /ul
