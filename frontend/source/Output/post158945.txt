How to restore jailbroken iPhone stuck in recovery mode without iTunes? <body> I have a jailbroken iPhone 4 running on iOS 7.1.1. I checked Cydia and updated a few tweaks and since that update, my tweak called "f.lux" wasn't working so I deleted it. After deleting it, I would swipe to unlock my home screen but my phone would just shut off and restart. Restoring it in iTunes didn't work and errors would always pop up. I tried using TinyUmbrella and it didn't work. I also tried downloading an ipsw file but that doesn't seem to work either. Do I just need to buy a new phone or is there a way of fixing it?  <answer158947> It’s not possible to do that without iTunes.  If you have a PC or Mac with iTunes installed, you can bring the device in DFU mode by performing the following steps:  ul liConnect the iPhone to your computer/li liPress and hold the Home button and the Sleep button at the same time/li liAfter 10 seconds, release the Sleep button/li liContinue holding the Home button until this iTunes message shows up: "iTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode. You must restore this iPhone before it can be used with iTunes"/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8bSxM.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can then restore it to the latest iOS version. Please be aware that this will erase strongall the data/strong on your device and will restore it to the stronglatest/strong iOS version (iOS 8.1.1 as of Dec 1st, 2014).  Please note: In DFU mode, the iPhone’s screen will remain black until you invoke the firmware restore. If it shows a "Connect to iTunes" screen, you are not in DFU mode but in recovery mode.  <answer169045> You can try the following steps:  Step 1: Disconnect the data cable and turn off your iPhone.  Step 2: Press the "Home" button and connect your iPhone to the computer with data cable, and then release the "Home" button.  Step 3: Now you have enter into recovery mode successfully.  Step 4: It is very easy for you to exit recovery mode. Please press both the "Home". button and "Power" button at the same time until the LOGO "white apple" appeared on the screen.  <comment186842> i already tried restoring my phone while in DFU mode and it still didn't work. Should i try restoring it on another laptop? <comment186849> If you used TinyUmbrella before, it may have altered your `/etc/hosts` file. This can be the reason for the iTunes restore errors. Could you check your hosts file if it contains `gs.apple.com` entries and if so, delete these rows? <comment186865> where do i check for hosts files? <comment186911> Depends wether you are on OS X or Windows. On OS X, you can enter `sudo nano /etc/hosts` in your terminal to modify it. In Windows, it’s located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`. To modify it, you’ll need to fire up Notepad as Administrator. <comment198213> Hey, did this work?
