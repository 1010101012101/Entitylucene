Mac sierra update, "other" account problem, cant log-in <body> I have a big trouble. I updated my software to Sierra. Log screen asked me username and account. I almost entered with my admin account but while the log in bar filling, the new account information of "other" prompts and it doesnt accept my administration username and password combo. I used terminal to "reserpassword" but now even there is no any volume, there is still "other"'s account prompt screen that I don't know.   thanks in advance.
