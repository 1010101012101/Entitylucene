How to retrieve Lightning/Thunderbird Calendar backup? <body> HELP - please. Suddenly, my ThunderBird/Lightning Calendar has mostly wrong dates/times (details below).  strongFirst, my system:/strong  Mac OS 10.7.5br ThunderBird (TB) 38.4.0br Lightning 4.0.4.1br Provider for Google Calendar 1.0.4  strongMy situation/strongbr For some reason, most of my TB/Lightning Calendar's Events dates/times (but not all, strangely) have changed to later ones (sometimes years later). It happened sometime after I migrated ALL :-( my Calendar Events from my locally-stored computer to Google Calendar about a month ago. Luckily, I do have backups of my pref.js files and local.sqlite files, BUT I don't know what to do with them within TB, to see them again.  strongMy efforts/strongbr I've tried opening an earlier local.sqlite file via Thunderbird  Open  Calendar File. It shows up as "Untitled Calendar" in my TB sidebar, with a yellow triangle/exclamation point next to it, but none of the Events show up in the Calendar. This .sqlite file DOES have the calendar events in them, as I can see the Events when I look at the file with DB Browser for SQLite and also with TB Add-on SQLite Manager.  This is as far as I've gotten after hours of uneducated floundering.  strongMy SOS/strongbr Can anyone help me with viewing/restoring earlier Calendars to my TB?! Pleeeeaassseee. Also, if someone can tell me how to decipher the event_start numbers, then maybe I can look at various local.sqlite files and see which ones have the correct dates/times in them and at least determine which file I need to work with.  strongThanks/strong!!!!
