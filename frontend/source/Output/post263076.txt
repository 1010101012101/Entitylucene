Primary Monitor Mission Control Switches to Desktop <body> I have a setup such that my laptop running OS X El Capitan is connected to 2 monitors. I have different spaces and full screen apps running on all monitors including the laptop, primary monitor in the center and the secondary monitor on the right.  I am running into an issue/bug with mission control such that when it is launched, my primary monitor in the center always defaults to the desktop and not to the fullscreen apps, even the monitor was showing the apps when I initiated the mission control.  Is this a known issue or is there a workaround? Anyone else running into this issue?
