iTunes fail to recognise iPhone <body> I downgraded iTunes12.0 to 10.0 but now strongmy iPhone is not shown up there/strong  I tried every possible thing!! Like re-install and update drivers etc etc!!!   Can somebody please tell me how to make it?  <comment282857> Why would you do that?  You're asking the wrong question I think <comment282858> My phone is showing up in windows (my computer) but when i open iTunes nothing is shown there <comment282860> Likely iTunes 10 does't recognize whatever later iOS version you are using.  This is an [XY problem](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem) <comment282861> That means iTunes 10.0 will not recognise iOS 9.2.1
