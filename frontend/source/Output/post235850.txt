What happens when PCIe boost circuits are overloaded? <body> In my understanding, the 2010 Mac Pro is rated for 75W of power for each PCIe slot, plus 75W for each of the two 6-pin boost (aux) circuits.  I know it's possible to exceed these limits, because I do it regularly. At what point does it have some effect, and what is that effect?  I'd like a very specific answer, not just, "it crashes".  My guesses:  ul liA thermal or power sensor trips and kills power to the offending circuit./li liA sensor trips and kills power to the whole PSU/li liThe motherboard traces melt and cause a fire/li liThe OS kills the process that is over-using the GPU/li /ul  Obviously, any of these options would cause the computer to crash.  My computer sometimes reboots spontaneously when I'm doing heavy GPU processing, and I just want to understand exactly what is happening.  Interesting sidenote:  after this type of crash, I always have to reinstall the Blackmagic Desktop Video driver before my DeckLink will be recognized.  <answer276328> Still running strong 30% overclock..   https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-pro-4-1-and-5-1-pcie-aux-power.2035519/  <comment347749> Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer. :) Unfortunately, short answers such as this don't really provide enough detail or context to help many users.
