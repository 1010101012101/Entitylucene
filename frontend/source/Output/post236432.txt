In iOS 9, Messages app no longer finds contacts properly when composing <body> I only recently upgraded from iOS 8 to iOS 9 on my iPhone, mostly because I hadn't bothered.  So far there are a few things I like, a few things I don't, but it's not a big deal either way, except for one thing; my ability to compose text messages has been severely crippled.  A lot of my contacts have nicknames stored on them. Previously, when composing a text and choosing the recipient(s), I could type part of the nickname or real name of any contact and the app would suggest various contact points for that person (normally a cell phone, followed by any/all email addresses).  Now, when typing a nickname like "Mom" or "Buzzsaw" or whatever, the only results that are suggested are group conversations where that person was involved.  Sometimes it will suggest a single contact, but it never seems to be their phone number, rather just an email address (presumably one they've enabled to accept iMessages on).  I can then tap the information (i) icon next to the contact and see more of their contact points, but that's an extra, dumb step.  If I think to search by their given name, I get more usable results, but with another problem.  It used to be that multiple contact points for one person would show up with the labels I had given them, such as "Work" or "iPhone."  Now it just shows a number.  Check out some examples...  A search for "T-Bone" in iOS 8 might have shown:  ul liDan Smith mobile/li liDan Smith work/li liDan Smith tbone@email.com/li /ul  In iOS 9 the same search might show:  ul liT-Bone, Buzzsaw and 6 others/li liT-Bone tbone@email.com/li /ul  In iOS 8 a search for "Dan" might have shown:  ul liDan Smith mobile/li liDan Smith work/li liDan Smith tbone@gmail.com/li liT-Bone, Buzzsaw and 6 others/li /ul  In iOS 9 this same "Dan" search might show:  ul liDan Smith 1+314-555-1234/li liDan Smith 1+636-555-4321/li liDan Smith tbone@gmail.com/li liDan Smith, Joe Jones and 6 others/li /ul  Is this just me?  How can I fix this?  <comment289582> Dang. This ghost town sure ain't no Stack Overflow! <comment290456> Further investigation has revealed that the upgrade messed with my contacts.  For some reason, many contacts appear to have simply lost their nicknames.  Others seem to have been sliced up in the "Linked Cards" way such that the nickname on one of the linked cards did not get linked and used as the main contact nickname.  In short, iOS 9 totally effed my contacts.  Hooray.  Anyone know how to fix this?
