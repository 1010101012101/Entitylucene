Moving Fusion VMs to ESXi <body> I am in the process of moving several VMs created in VMWare Fusion 5 into ESXi 5.1, which I just installed on a Mac Mini Server. I am able to connect just fine via the Windows application installed on another VM. I have created two OVF files, one for Server 2003 and another for Server 2012. Both files were created without incident. I am able to upload them to the ESXi server seemingly without issue as well.  However, when I start either of the VMs, I get the following error(s):  Console:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4K2s.png" alt="enter image description here"  And in the GUI:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zje3a.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm unsure how to proceed, as I have followed the steps outlined to create an OVF file and upload it to the ESX. Both of these VMs work fine through Fusion.  Thanks in advance.  <answer99443> I would suggest using the VMWare converter to move the virtual machines from one host to another. This will do all the heavy lifting for you. It's free.   http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/  This is your best option as the converter does all the vm configurations and settings for you. This is also suggested in the KB Article (1000936) from VMWare.   You have to do this on a windows machine. Inside a VM on the same fusion host works just fine.  <answer111815> After arduous research and trial and error, I've finally been able to solve this issue. First of all, if you're migrating Fusion VMs to ESXi, I recommend not using the OVF tool. At least for me, it never worked properly. Instead, I used the codevmware-vdiskmanager/code tool, which is built into Fusion. The instructions for this migration are listed below:     ol   liOpen Terminal./li   liRun the following command, inserting the correct VMWare Fusion vmdk file source and new vmdk destination:            code/Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-vdiskmanager     &gt; -r /path/to/vmware_fusion.vmwarevm/vmware_fusion.vmdk -t 4 /path/to/esxi.vmdk/code/li     liThe conversion process, once complete, will create two files: codefilename.vmdk/code, and codefilename-flat.vmdk/code./li     liLaunch the vSphere client through your web browser to your ESXi server./li     liOnce logged in, go to codeFile | New | Virtual Machine/code/li     liIn the Configuration window, select codeCustom/code./li     liIn the Storage window, select the datastore location to store the new VM./li     liIn the Virtual Machine Version window, use the default option of codeVirtual Machine Version: 8./code/li     liSelect the desired settings for codeGuest OS, CPUs, Memory, Network/code, and codeSCSI Controller/code./li     liIn the Select a Disk window, choose the codeDo Not Create Disk/code option./li     liClick the codeFinish/code button./li     liIn the ESXi server settings, select the Configuration tab then click on codeStorage/code./li     liIn Storage, select your datastore and right-click to select codeBrowse Datastore/code./li     liSelect the folder name that corresponds to the new VM./li     liSelect the codeUpload/code button./li     liUpload the codefilename.vmdk/code and codefilename-flat.vmdk/code files from Step 3./li     liOnce complete, you will only see the codefilename.vmdk/code file in the datastore./li     liSelect the VM and codeEdit virtual machine settings/code under the codeGet Started/code tab./li     liClick the codeAdd/code button in the codeVirtual Machine Properties/code window./li     liFor Device Type, select codeHard Disk/code, and choose codeUse an existing virtual disk/code. /li     liLocate the datastore and select the existing disk./li     liIn the codeAdvanced Options/code, leave the default settings./li     liSelect codeFinish/code and codeOK/code to close the Virtual Machine Properties./li     liAt this point, you should be able to boot to the newly migrated VM./li     /ol      Guidance for this came from MacTech's June 2013 issue, reproduced at the author's blog here. Many kudos to Rich Trouton for this article.  <answer178666> There has been an update to OVFTOOL around since March 2015 (Now V4.1.0.). With this OSX version I have much fewer trouble to get OVFTool to work. Even a OSX VM transfer from Fusion to ESXi is now just a one line like:  precode/Applications/VMware\ OVF\ Tool/ovftool --compress=9 ./OS_X_10.vmx vi://root@ESX6i /code/pre  Finally it is working like expected, when the old versions just copied parts or I had to try 10 times to get the desired results with some crude workarounds. So please give it another try! ;)  <comment116993> Just guessing, but it looks like there's a problem with the virtual hard disk; maybe it's not connected as expected.  I'd check there first. <comment116994> I've been unable to find a Mac version of the VMWare Converter, so I'll give this a whirl once I stand up a non-production Windows machine for the operation. <comment116995> @zigg, I've redone the VM conversion several times. Each time, I reload it, and get the same error. <comment117026> Ok, I just run it inside a win7 vm. Sorry I forgot to mention that. <comment117120> The conversion process worked, or did so apparently. However, when I upload the files via the ESXi interface, they load to the file system, but they give me the same error as above. I'm missing something somewhere. <comment117130> You should have been able to convert and install the vm directly to the esxi server without needing to copy any files. <comment117159> If it is a VM that originated from a product other than Fusion, the process works fine. It's the conversion of Fusion VMs that is giving me the issue. <comment211856> excellent! I'll have to give that a try.
