Multiple app versions from different developer accounts <body> Can I submit the same app from multiple developer accounts with just different app icon and some color difference inside the app?  <answer206935> You may be able to do this but without a clear and compelling reasons Apple might reject later editions.  Acceptable reasons might include differing legal ownership for different geographic regions.  From Apple's App Store Review Guidelines:     h1App Store Review Guidelines/h1      h22. Functionality/h2      2.11 Apps that duplicate Apps already in the App Store may be rejected, particularly if there are many of them, such as fart, burp, flashlight, and Kama Sutra Apps   <comment249524> Yep I know this paragraph, but I think it applies to 100 apps not to 10 or sth like this, what is your opinion? <comment249533> I'd love to know ***why?*** <comment249536> Each customer want to sell the same app under its own brand <comment249538> Ah, OK - makes more sense than just the question on its own - thanks :) ...though that might be part of your submission, that it needs different branding for a specific purpose. <comment249546> My opinion does not matter. Submit your applications to Apple and see what Apple's reviewers think. Good luck!
