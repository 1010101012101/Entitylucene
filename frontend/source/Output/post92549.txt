Using a apple tv box as a second monitor to your osx machine <body> I've heard that you can use as ipad as a second monitor to you macbook by using software like iDisplay.  Is it possible to use apple TV in a similar capacity?  If so then: a. Which software do I use? b. What types of appleTvs will allow that?  Thanks.  <answer92555> This isn't something as easily accomplished since for iOS to act as a second display, an App provides that functionality. Since you cannot add apps easily to an Apple TV, you are constrained to mirroring the display, not extending it from OS X.  <answer95014> This functionality is due in the fall with the next OS X version.  You'll have to wait a few more months.  <answer95022> It's not possible at the current moment. What you have right now is just mirroring the display.   <answer95158> This is possible today on iOS 6 and OS X 10.8 using air parrot software:  http://www.airsquirrels.com/airparrot/  <comment108564> Possible, yes, but apparently nobody has written a suitable driver yet. <comment111421> Where did you get that piece of information? <comment111588> I would say you might specify which Apple TV you have and restrict software to just that model or perhaps edit that out and ask a follow on question if you find a product that works, but doesn't work for your device.
