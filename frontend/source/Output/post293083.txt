Using SMS-based two-step verification with a single Apple device and no iCloud <body> Given the two following factors:  ul liI own only a single Apple device (a MacBook, running Sierra)/li liI don't use iCloud/li /ul  Can I use two-step authentication, ie. receive a code by strongSMS/strong to log into the Apple ID site and similar services? Note: Two-step verification is not the same as two-factor authentication.  When I follow the link "Set up two-step verification now", after logging in I get "This session has timed out for your security." And my Apple ID page offers only TFA, which requires iCloud.  Has Apple stopped supporting SMS-based logins? Or how do I set it up? (I should also mention I waited three days to start this process, as is required by Apple for reasons unknown.)
