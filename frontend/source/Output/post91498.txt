Wireless USB adaptors for Macs <body> We've just got a new projector at work which sports fancy Wireless VGA connectivity. We have a Wireless USB adaptor to connect to it, but there are no drivers for Macs and OS X available for it.  I've done a little bit of hunting round the internet for an adaptor that does support Macs, but haven't turned up anything yet. Do you know of a Wireless USB adaptor that supports Macs and OS X?  strongNote:/strong by "Wireless USB" I mean the standard which is USB without cords, and not USB adaptors for connecting to wireless networks.   <comment107452> What is the model of the USB you have right now. <comment107473> It's an IOGear GUWA200 http://www.iogear.com/product/GUWA200/ <comment107476> It is not clear to me why do you need that USB on your MAC or is that a part of the projector? Mac has wifi build in! The question is to be able to find your projector in the wifi network and connect to it. What is the projector type and does it has wifi build in or it needs that adopter to work. <comment107484> Read the paragraph headed "**Note:**" at the end of my question: I am *not* talking about WiFi. <comment107490> My mistake, sorry did not read the details :(
