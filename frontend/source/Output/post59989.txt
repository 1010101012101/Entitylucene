*AMP setup Impact on upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion <body> I have Snow Leopard. I want to upgrade to Mountain Lion. I've setup PHP as mentioned here. Will upgrading to Lion affect my PHP setup or any other setup like MySQL for that matter ?  <answer59990> If you have the latest version of MAMP it should be fine. MAMP 2.1.1 is compatible with Mountain Lion, although if you have any issues it's pretty easy to reinstall.  <comment69041> Sorry for the misleading title. I really didn't install MAMP from mamp.info - I referring to Apache, MySQL & PHP manual installations.
