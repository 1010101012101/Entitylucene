Installing Ubuntu on Mac with macOS and Windows already installed <body> I have a dual-boot MacBook Pro late 2013 with macOS Sierra and Windows 10 (BOOTCAMP) already installed. I want to install Ubuntu as a third OS. Is there any (easy) way to do it?   precode&gt; Disk Partitions: /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Gp8T.png" alt="enter image description here"  precode&gt; Gpt dev disk0 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FfJjW.png" alt="enter image description here"  precode&gt; Fdisk disk0 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPmg9.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHnnw.png" alt="Disk Utility"  <answer257275> This answer installs Ubuntu on your computer without the use of third parity tools for either the installation of booting of Ubuntu. The Ubuntu file I downloaded was named codeubuntu-16.10-desktop-amd64.iso/code. I assume you have created a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive installer and have verified the contents. I also assume you have verified hardware compatibility by successfully booting the live version of Ubuntu. These instructions have been divided into the three main sections listed below.  ul liemCreate Space on the Drive for Ubuntu/em : This is accomplished by using the MacOS Terminal application to enter commands./li liemInstall Ubuntu/em : This uses the Ubuntu flash drive installer./li liemAdd Ubuntu to Startup Manager/em - Here you basically use the MacOS to move the necessary files to the proper locations.

If you need a different size, then make the appropriate adjustments. I will be creating 3 new partitions for Ubuntu. A description for each is given below.  ul liA Swap partition. The size of this partition should be between 1 to 2 times the size of the memory installed in your Mac computer. I will be using a size of 800 MB. Obviously, the size you will be using will be much larger./li liA Ext4 Journaling file system partition to hold Ubuntu. This partition will consume most the approximately 40 GB of space I allocated for Ubuntu./li liAn EFI System partition. This is required for Ubuntu to appear on the Mac Startup Manager. This manager appears when you turn on or restart your Mac and hold down the kbdoption/kbd key. The Startup Manager can be used to change the default startup disk (i.e. operating system) or can be used to temporarily boot from a startup disk. I have chosen size of 500 MB for this partition./li /ul  I have chosen to allow the Ubuntu installer to actually create the 3 new partitions. So at this point, I only need to shrink the MacOS partition by approximately 40 GB and create 3 new placeholder partitions. The placeholders will be replaced later by the Ubuntu installer with the actual partitions described above.   The command to change to partitioning is given below. Since the MacOS partition is about 180 GB, I used a desired value of 140 GB (code140G/code). Also, I used a value of 800 MB (code800M/code) for the size of the new Swap partition. Since you will desire a larger size, then you will need to make the appropriate substitution. Note: The two values of 200 MB (code200M/code) were chosen arbitrarily, these values will change later.  precodediskutil resizevolume disk0s2 140G 3 jhfs+ part1 800M jhfs+ part2 200M jhfs+ part3 200M /code/pre  The output from this command is shown below.  precodeStarted partitioning on disk0s2 Macintosh HD Verifying the disk Verifying file system Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume Checking extents overflow file Checking catalog file Checking multi-linked files Checking catalog hierarchy Checking extended attributes file Checking volume bitmap Checking volume information The volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK File system check exit code is 0 Resizing Waiting for the disks to reappear Formatting disk0s3 as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with name part1 Initialized /dev/rdisk0s3 as a 763 MB case-insensitive HFS Plus volume with a 8192k journal Mounting disk Formatting disk0s4 as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with name part2 Initialized /dev/rdisk0s4 as a 191 MB case-insensitive HFS Plus volume with a 8192k journal Mounting disk Formatting disk0s5 as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with name part3 Initialized /dev/rdisk0s5 as a 37 GB case-insensitive HFS Plus volume with a 8192k journal Mounting disk Finished partitioning on disk0s2 Macintosh HD /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            140.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                  Apple_HFS part1                   800.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                  Apple_HFS part2                   200.0 MB   disk0s4    5:                  Apple_HFS part3                   39.5 GB    disk0s5    6:         Microsoft Reserved                         16.8 MB    disk0s6    7:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                70.1 GB    disk0s7 /code/pre     Note: The last code200M/code was ignored by the codediskutil/code command.

Update your answer with the output from the following commands: `diskutil list`, `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`. Also, what Ubuntu installation file did you download and have you been able to boot to the live version from a USB flash drive? <comment321107> Images has been added.
