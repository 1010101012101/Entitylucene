My iPhone cannot connect to the internet on cellular data and wifi <body> My iPhone 5 with iOS 9.2.1 suddenly cannot connect to the internet, neither via cellular data or wifi. All applications that requires internet connection are unable to reach their server. I was in the middle of texting using WhatsApp when this happens, and this is my 2nd time experiencing this (the previous one I was able to get my connection back after restarting iPhone).  I can confirm I have an active internet connection on from my telecom provider and ISP. Tried restart/force restart/reset network connection but without success.  <answer231813> Check to see if you have a VPN connection set up. Settings  General  VPN.  <comment283004> Try to install a `ping` app and ping your router or google.com. Do you have a configuration profile installed? (Settings  General  Configuration Profiles) Do you have a VPN installed? <comment283015> Figured it out. Turns out there is a VPN profile with on-demand connectivity enabled. After disabling it connection back to normal. Thanks Chloe for directing me to the answer. Can you reply it on answer section so I can mark it as the solution? <comment308243> Figured it out.
