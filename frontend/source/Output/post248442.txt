How do I create a virtual machine with a disk size different than the default? <body> I'm creating a virtual machine for Windows 7 x64. However vmware fusion automatically decides the disk size can be 60GB and no smaller.  How do I create a virtual machine with a smaller disk?  <answer248447> When you are done with the wizard, right click on the VM and select "settings" then pick "Hard Disk" then you should be able to move the cursor left and right to adjust the size of the disk.  <answer248450> VMWare Fusion (which I'm assuming you're using since you're posting in the Apple section) has some presets for disk space depending on the OS (20 GB for Linux, 60 GB for Windows, and 40 GB for OS X) when you create a new virtual machine. There are two ways around this:  strongOption 1: Create your own virtual disk/strongbr 1. Run code/Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-vdiskmanager -c -t 0 -s 20GB -a ide myDisk.vmdk/code to create a new virtual disk.   Replace "20GB" with your desired size and "myDisk.vmdk" with the desired name and path of your new diskbr 2. When creating the machine in VMWare Fusion, in the "Choose a Virtual Disk" screen, check the option to use an existing virtual disk. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tUNev.png" alt="VMWare Disk Selection"  strongOption 2: Resize before installing/strongbr You can also resize the newly created virtual disk strongbefore/strong the OS is installed.br 1. Set up your VM as normal, accepting the default disk size for now.br 2. When you get to this screen, click "Customize Settings":br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4JnTv.png" alt="Customize Settings"br 3. Save the VMbr 4. In the Settings window, click "Hard Disk (SCSI)"br 5. Resize your disk as needed and click "Apply"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kPVd1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment307815> Thanks, this worked better than I thought it would. <comment307817> This seems a little more complicated than I would like, but atleast it shows me how to create a virtual disk. ;) <comment348798> Doesn't work anymore. After clicking 'Install OS X from the recovery partition' it decides to create everything for me and absolutely nothing works to decrease the stupid disk size.
