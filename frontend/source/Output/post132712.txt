Tighten hinge on 27" Cinema Display? <body> I just purchased a new 27" Cinema Display from Apple and I'm wondering if there is any way to tighten the hinge that attaches to the stand for adjusting the angle. I'm a DJ and noticed when I'm performing, the display keeps tilting forward on it's own (likely from some slight bass vibrations). I have two 24" Cinema Displays and the hinge has much more friction than the 27" - I realize the size and weight is greater, although are they normally so loosey goosey?  <answer132741> There are 2 methods to do that.  1- Mechanical  2-Chemical  ul lifor mechanical take the screw out and bring it to your hardware store, they will give you tongued washers or claw washers that prevents the screw from loosening./li /ul  The pro for this method is you can loosen the screw.  ul lifor Chemical method go to your hardware store and get the glue (for the screw)./li /ul  The negative, it will be extremely hard to remove the screw.
