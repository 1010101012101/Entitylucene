Is the C compiler used in Xcode ANSI-compliant? <body> I need to build php from source but when I compile php and apache with strongxcode/strong, Compiler logs some warnings about "deprecated" uses however I use latest tools.  So I found out that apache recommends "ANSI-C" compiler.     Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C compiler (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended. If you don't have GCC then at least make sure your vendor's compiler is ANSI compliant. In addition, your PATH must contain basic build tools such as make.    So is the compiler used in Xcode actually ANSI-compliant?  <comment271312> clang is ANSI compliant so we would need to see the errors <comment271313> a) This might be more on topic on  [so] and b) deprecated means that the commands you use in your code are old, not that your compiler is <comment271314> "However I use latest tools" by that I meant this. do you think codes of php7 should be deprecated ? that must be an issue with compiler <comment271315> my question was How different is GCC of ANSI-C is from xCode's ? which means it has something todo with mac not with codes <comment271324> As far as I know clang is ANSI compliant so the issue is with the code. and the error explicitly says the code is deprecated not the compiler. (Not this will be off topic on SO as not enough info)
