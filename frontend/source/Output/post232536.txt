iPod Classic only charges from computer, not from AC adaptor <body> I have an old iPod Classic (80 GB) which works fine; but I can strongonly/strong charge it via USB from a computer, and not from an official Apple AC adaptor. I have tried all the usual tricks found on other sites (like a reset), various USB cables, various USB adaptors, various computers...  Note : as we have many Apple devices in the house, maybe I am not using the original AC adaptor that came with the iPod but a more recent one that came with an iPhone.
