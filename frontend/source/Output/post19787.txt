Anyone know of a DAB capable Airplay Speaker <body> Is there such a thing as a DAB capable AirPlay Speaker system currently available?  I would want something good quality not just a cheap £60 thing with 10 watts power.  <answer25137> There are some systems out there, I think one by Marantz, but they are fairly high end systems (£400+). I am also on the look out for something similar for my kitchen, I just want a small all in one unit that has both DAB and Airplay, but it seems that isn't possible yet.  <comment41883> Hardware and shopping recommendation ("let's go shopping") questions are off topic here. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks.
