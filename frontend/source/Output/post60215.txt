Mac OS X 10.7.4 Mail Client triggers Opera for external links in email <body> I would like to have Safari open any links in email messages. However it seems that Opera has hijacked this and I can't see any property that can change this. Any ideas?  <answer60216> It's a little counter-intuitive, but you can set the default web browser for email messages from within Safari, just select the Preferences - General option and then choose an application from the "Default web browser" pop-up menu. Hope that helps.
