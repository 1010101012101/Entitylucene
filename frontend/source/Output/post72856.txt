Xcode doesn't show up in spotlight results, neither search results <body> I haven't noticed exactly when it happened but previously I was always using spotlight to run Xcode. Now if i'm typing "Xcode" in it, only folders containing this name show up, or some xcode projects, not all though.  I've tried search in finder and even choosing kind of files - Application, still no luck. Did Anybody face this problem before?  <answer72897> Try Rebuilding Spotlight index.  You can do it from the Terminal:  precode$ sudo mdutil -i on / /code/pre  <answer278568> I had a similar problem after upgrading to Xcode 8.3. It simply stopped showing up in the spotlight search result. Rebuilding by adding Application folder to the privacy list in spotlight preferences, didn't help.  Executing codesudo touch /Applications/Xcode.app/code in the Terminal worked.  Cheers, Jon  <answer284077> After upgrading from El Capitan to macOS Sierra I had the same problem.  The only command that did the trick was:  precodesudo mdutil -E # from mdutil usage "Erase and rebuild index" /code/pre  If that one doesn't work directly, try running this command first:  precodesudo mdutil -i on # from mdutil usage "Turn indexing on or off" /code/pre  <comment84604> does it happen only with xcode? <comment84639> it looks like only to xcode. other apps that i run through the spotlight (like Chrome, Pages, Terminal, TextWrangler, etc.) are working fine as it was before. <comment84640> i think that has happened after some xcode update or so... <comment84729> helped! thanks! <comment84764> Awesome, I'm glad it helped you, cheers! :-) <comment367413> For me only a combination of both steps worked, only touching Xcode didn't work, but after putting in into the privacy list and then running the command fixed the problem
