Reset Snow Leopard user accounts/preference <body> My kids completely changed everything in their user account, what is the easiest way to reset everything to default (without reinstalling everything) including:  ul liName of hard drive/li liMenu items in Finder/li liDock size and items/li liSize/appearance of things/li liEven some applications have been moved from their original location/li /ul  <answer3723> ul liName of hard drivebr Click enter, rename it/li liMenu items in Finderbr What do you mean by that?/li liDock size and itemsbr Trashing code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist/code will do the trick/li liSize/appearance of thingsbr Trashing the code.plist/code file under code~/Library/Preferences/code/li liEven some applications have been moved from their original locationbr You'll have to move them back to code/Applications/code manually./li /ul  In order for that not to be reproduced, you could try codeParental Controls/code under codeSystem Preferences/code  codeAccount/code and limit what they can do on their account.  <answer3726> In addition to Loïc’s excellent answer     strongMenu items in Finder/strong       What do you mean by that?   I believe he means the Finder’s Sidebar and such. In order to reset those, thrash the following file and logoff (or restart):  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist /code/pre     strongEven some applications have been moved from their original location/strong      You'll have to move them back to   /Applications manually.   Yes, unless he has a Time Machine backup… which I believe he doesn’t. :)  <comment3500> Yep, you were right I meant the Finder's Sidebar. I do have a Time Machine + Time Capsule for the kid's iMac but I thought it may be easier just to reset things than dig through backups. <comment3510> @Abdullah for the Apps it might be easier to restore them with TimeMachine, just go to Time Machine while in the /Applications folder and scroll back “in time” - restore, overwrite, keep old :) Some app might need an update but at least you’ll have them back.
