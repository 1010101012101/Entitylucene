How to configure `ipfw` on Lion, Mountain Lion? <body> I'd like to configure and start codeipfw/code on Macs running codeLion/code, codeMountain Lion/code.  I found that codepfctl/code is configured and started with:  precode/etc/pf.conf /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist /code/pre  How is codeipfw/code configured and launched?  <answer107474> strongipfw is configured in code/etc/pf.conf/code/strong  hr  You can configure the ipfw using a GUI in IceFloor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzjAk.png" alt="IceFloor: Filter inbound connections"  <answer113065> This guide: Setting Up ipfw on Mac OS X, shows you how to set up IPFW on Mac OS X. The article was posted in 2012, so should apply to Lion/ML.  <comment126078> I updated my original question to clarify that I'm not talking of packet filter but ip firewall. <comment126079> → grgarside: thank you for the usefull info. But, `/etc/pf.conf` and `IceFloor` are for packet filter. I want to use the basic `ipfw`. <comment132704> Well documented answer ☺.
