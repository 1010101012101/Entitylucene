Is there a unified shortcut key of Home/End for Terminal, Vim and Sublime Text in OS X? <body> It seems that in codeTerminal/code:     kbdfn/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd←/kbd is kbdHome/kbdbr   kbdfn/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd→/kbd is kbdEnd/kbd   in codeVim/code:     kbdfn/kbd+kbd←/kbd is kbdHome/kbdbr   kbdfn/kbd+kbd→/kbd is kbdEnd/kbd   in codeSublime Text/code:     kbdcmd/kbd+kbd←/kbd is kbdHome/kbdbr   kbdcmd/kbd+kbd→/kbd is kbdEnd/kbd   And kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdA/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdE/kbd seems to work in codeTerminal/code and codeSublime Text/code (but it changes the cursor to the beginning/end of the entire line, not just the wrapped line), but not in codeVim/code.  Is there a unified shortcut key of Home/End for codeTerminal/code and codeVim/code?  It's difficult to switch the mindset of shortcut key when switching between these two contexts because it happens so frequently.  <comment276221> For the record, Ctrl+E also works in `nano`
