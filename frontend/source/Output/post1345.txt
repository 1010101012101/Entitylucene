And there you have it!   <answer46601> The above answers are all correct. However, in iOS 5 there’s a new way of quickly inputting special characters.  Simply go to strongSettings → General → Keyboard → Shortcuts/strong, and tap the kbd+/kbd button to add a new keyboard shortcut.   Basically, this is the same functionality that OS X’s strongSystem Preferences → Language &amp; Text → Text → Symbol and text substitution/strong offers.  So, get any symbol you want as described in the other answers, copy it, then add it as a new keyboard shortcut this way.

Pretty sure the iPad keyboard does not have the "Option" key? <comment1300> I think glyphboard is not available outside the US. <comment2469> Why would glyphboard not be available outside the US? It's a web app that works offline, not an app installed through the App Store. I'm in Sweden and it works just fine. <comment53280> There’s also http://mackeys.info/ (try it on your iPhone!), which was more useful back in the day when Emoji iOS keyboards weren’t unlockable for everyone. <comment53360> That 'flip' shortcut is brilliant! :D <comment71085> These Emoji glyphs aren't typical characters, so they probably won't be visible off the iPhone or on Macs running OSes older than Lion. <comment79652> A link and description might be nice.
