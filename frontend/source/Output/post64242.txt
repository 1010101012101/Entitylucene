How to make a script which runs on login? <body> My ISP requires me to login to their server and keep the login page up so I can use the Internet, which makes me uncomfortable while I download some big files. After some research i found a script which is supposed to run on Linux environment, which you can find here.br Can I make this script run on my Mac while I log-in?br Also the script provides some keep-alive functions, can I make them work in my Mac?   Can I add these features with script?  h2Features/h2  ol liAutomatically connect to Asianet Dataline without having to sign in via the browser./li liIn startup and free mode the script will keep the connection alive./li liThe script will automatically reconnect if connection breaks because of a  power failure or a line problem./li /ol  I am using a Macbook 5,2 running Lion 10.7 Please let me know if you need any more info.  <answer64245> Yes that script emshould/em run on OS X. It is a .sh file and it's using the bash shell, so I'd assume that it would run, unless it requires programs that aren't installed on OS X by default.br strongTo have it run on login:/strongbr Just go to System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups and click on the user that you want the script to load. Click the kbd+/kbd button to add a login item and navigate to your script. The script will load automatically on login.  <comment75378> Hi, Please see my edit. I have more doubt. <comment75380> The "features" that you requested are part of the .sh script itself. Looking at the README file on github, those are the *exact* features the script provides. Have you tried running it on OS X yet? <comment75382> Try to run it from Terminal.app first. If this works as you expect, login automation is the next step. <comment75383> @NikhilMohan To run it, open Terminal and drag and drop the file onto the Terminal window, then hit enter to make it run. Note: You do need to edit the .sh file to include your username and password. <comment75384> What happens when you try to run the script on its own? Open Terminal.app, make sure it's executable by running `chmod +x /path/to/script`, then run it with `/path/to/script`. <comment75385> @daviesgeek i did drop the script in terminal. But nothing happens. <comment75386> Did you hit Enter/Return? <comment75388> yes i id see screenshot http://s13.postimage.org/9n3f54ivr/Screen_Shot_2012_09_17_at_9_38_55_PM.png <comment75390> `chmod +x` isn't the command to run the script, it just prepares makes the script executable. To run it, type `/Users/niksmac/Personal/auto-login.sh` followed by enter. <comment75392> @daviesgeek yeah you are a genius. i got it working, but a small warning. `date: illegal time format usage: date [-jnu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ...              [-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format]` <comment75395> The OS X `date` doesn't support `-d` as needed by the script.
