How can I stop NTFS-3g from mounting a particular volume? <body> I have NTFS-3g installed and working. I don't want it to mount my Boot Camp partition; I do want it to mount any other NTFS drives I have. How do I do this?  (The mounted volume list in NTFS-3g's System Preferences page is always empty, for whatever reason, so I can't disable it that way. As I recall, this option puts a file on the disk in the root directory. But what should the file's name be? I'm having no luck with google here...)  OS X 10.10.3.  <answer187919> Add the following line to the strong/etc/fstab/strong file.  codeLABEL=BOOTCAMP none ntfs rw,noauto 0 0/code  If the label is something other then "BOOTCAMP" set it to what it is.  To edit the strongfstab/strong file, in a Terminal: codesudo nano /etc/fstab/code  To save the changes press kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdO/kbd and to exit press kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdX/kbd
