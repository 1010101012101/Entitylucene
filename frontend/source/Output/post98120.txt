Why don't my power or home button on my iPhone 4 work? <body> My home and power button don't work. I also tried the assistive touch, but those buttons don't still work. What should I do?  <answer98538> Assistive touch should work because it is an on-screen feature not hardware. The home button might not be working because of a hardware failure.  <comment115238> So the onscreen menus of assistive touch do not work either?
