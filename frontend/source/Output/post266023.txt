Automator Print Plugin: Append Output to Existing PDF File <body> I would like to create a Print Plugin to append the output to an existing PDF File.  Here are my steps so far:  ul liAsk for Finder Items/li liCombine PDF Pages (append)/li liOpen Finder Items/li /ul  It sort of does the job, but:  ul liIt emprepends/em the output: the new output is inserted at the beginning rather than the end./li liI creates a new file./li /ul  I can handle the new file situation, I suppose, by doing a Save As…, but I don’t want the new output to be placed at the beginning.  How can I append the output at the end of an existing PDF file?  <answer266963> A very old discussion on https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2240963 had the solution.  Here is a working version of the plugin:  precode1   Ask for Finder Items         Type: Files 2   Set Value of Variable         Variable: original 3   Run Shell Script         Pass input: as arguments         Script: echo $2                 echo $1 4   Combine PDF Pages         Combine documents by: Appending pages 5   Get Value of Variable         Variable: original 6   Run Shell Script         Pass input: as arguments         Script: mv $1 $3 7   Open Finder Items         Open with: Default Application /code/pre  Step 3 solves the problem of appending rather than prepending the file by echoing the items in the reverse order. Steps 2, 5 &amp; 6 takes care of creating a new file by renaming (and moving) the new file to the original.  As soon as I have tested it out more, I will post a link to a working version.
