Screencapture with zooming <body> In Snow Leopard when I used a screencapture program (⇧⌃⌘4) on the screen area that was zoomed in (by using ⌃ + mouse wheel) the resulting screen shot has the same zoom factor. Super useful when I wanted to take some small, detailed screen shot.  In 10.7 screencapture ignores the zoom factor and resulting screen shot is in 1:1 scale.  Is there some codedefaults/code setting, or anything else, that could bring back the SnowLeopard behavior?  <answer21954> The answer appears to be "No". I have also tested this with the commercial screen-capture utility SnagIt, and it behaves the same way, which is different in Lion from the way it behaved in Snow Leopard.  My suggested work-around is to use Automator's built-in "Scale Images" action to create a workflow to scale your screen shots to the size you want.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7gnIX.png" alt="enter image description here"  [Commercial programs such as GraphicConverter and Pixelmator can scale screen captures, and they also provide additional Automator actions with additional capabilities. You can see some of these in the example above--I own both GraphicConverter and Pixelmator, so these additional options are visible under Automator on my system.]  <comment24195> Does it really matter? You still have the same number of pixels in the screenshot, therefore the same quality. The image you were getting before is just a pixelated copy of what you are getting now. <comment24207> @spudwaffle It does matter to me because otherwise I have to change a size of my screen shot manually. I'm not after image quality, but I want to show (even pixelated) design detail of say 25 x 24 px (size in 1:1 scale) area of the screen. <comment24209> Thanks for your insight. I can confirm the same for the LittleSnapper.app. If nothing else, I'll use Automator action you suggested. <comment24211> Go with @Wheat Williams` answer. <comment90072> There's got too be a better way than having to post-scale the screenshot. Zoomed screenshots makes for so much better WYSIWYG operation.
