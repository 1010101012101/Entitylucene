2012 MacBook Air has wear spot on the bottom left <body> My mid-2012 MacBook Air has a spot on the bottom plate. The computer has never been dropped. Does anyone have any idea what could cause this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0mYU.jpg" alt="Wear Spot"  <answer142022> Is that circle actually there in real life, or did you add that to highlight the mark?  The scratch could be caused by something as simple as some grit on a table.  The feet on the air doesn't keep it very far off a surface, so just sliding the laptop with some grit could do that.    <answer142307> I took the computer in to Apple, and they determined that the spot was the result of a bulge caused by a piece of foam on the speaker. They told me that the foam and its attached components were the wrong parts.   <comment167328> It *could* be a bad battery cell that has expanded and pushed the bottom of the case out just enough to scrape. <comment167640> The circle is part of the wear.
