Tried to install Mountain Lion, it downloaded but nothing happened, now it wont re-download <body> I just bought Mountain Lion. It downloaded and I installed it and it restarted my laptop but nothing happened. When I went on the app store it was in my purchases, but had the download icon next to it. when I click on it it says:     "You have updates available for other accounts. Please sign in to the account used to purchase this to download it."   But I don't have any other accounts, and I am the only user on this laptop.  Any suggestions?  <comment86763> When you say you installed it did you run the installer app that would have gone into your Applications folder when you downloaded it.
