No space of iphone, no downloads been made <body> I'm kinda stuck, because on my iphone 5 16gb with ios 8, all free space gone. According to usage manager i should have around 1gb. Few days ago i've deleted couple music album, and freed about 300mb, but today i see that abound 5mb left. I didn't do any downloads updates or anything else. Just phone calls. I've also checked if there was update file downloaded, but there were none. Any ideas how can i check where my space gone?  <answer168231> Any chance you still have photos under "Recently Deleted"? They still count as memory used.  <comment197067> It's probably caching or other daily use features, like safari history, call history,  messages etc since it's such a small amount of space. But no, you can't see it, you can view your storage and act accordingly , you can delete app data without deleting the actual app. <comment197082> @soulshined i've deleted photos, to free up 1 gb, and check if my space keep dissapearing <comment197567> nope, i've remoted everything
