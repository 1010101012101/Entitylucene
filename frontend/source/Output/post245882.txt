Is there a way to display an instance of BezelUI (brightness HUD, volume HUD) using BASH or AppleScript? <body> Long story short, I've written a simple BASH script to control the brightness of a non-Apple external monitor using codeddcctl/code. It works, with a couple hacks.  It would be strongreally/strong cool if I could display a notification when the script is called, so the end user can be aware what the current setting is relative to min/max. I just found out about AppleScript's codedisplay notification/code function, which is cool—but the notifications don't go away on their own. I also found this essay on BezelServices, which is also neat—but I'm trying to do simple scripting, not creating an entire application.
