Mac Air heating issue <body> My Macbook Air (early 2015) often gets heated to about 75Â°C while workinh with heavy softwares and gaming. Should I be worried? What should I do?  I do use a laptop cooler while gaming.  Thanks!  <comment347380> Welcome to Ask Different.  Please edit if you are measuring something other than CPU. I'm 95% sure you're fine and don't need the cooler, but an edit will clarify your question if needed.
