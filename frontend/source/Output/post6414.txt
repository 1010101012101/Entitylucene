View Image Full Screen <body> On occasion I need to look at an image at fullscreen so it doesn't have anything else around it to distract me. Is there a way to do that? I can't seem to find a way to do it with preview.  <answer6415> You can use View - Slideshow to do this in Preview  <answer6419> Additionally you can use QuickLook (spacebar) and click the FullScreen button :)  <answer9120> kbd⌥␣/kbd in Finder opens QuickLook directly in full screen. There's also Sequential, a small app basically meant for viewing folders of images in full screen.  <comment6692> That was simple enough. Not sure why I didn't try that before.
