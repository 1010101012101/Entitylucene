Constant popups for bla-bla wants access to bla-bla keychain <body> e.g.  cloudd wants access to icloud keychain, local items keychain etc.  I have been going nuts with this bug (it IS a bug as it seems to be caused by unhandled corruption to the icloud keychain).  I've had it 3 times now and it keeps coming back.   I'm basically emalmost/em constantly bombarded with requests to provide a password for any one of several combinations of the above error (different things needed access to different keychains).   When I provide my password, it either gives me an 'incorrect password' response (shaking) or accepts it then asks for it again.  I have tried to turn off iCloud, but I can't, it turns itself back on.  I'm guessing this was a sync issue originally, but it's well out of hand now.  I'm using a 2015 macbook pro with 10.12.3 (Sierra).  <answer280296> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5680074?tstart=0  I got this from an answer on the Apple.com site link (above) after about 6 hours searching and trying different solutions.  It's the only one that hasn't shown at least one of those login prompts in the first 5 minutes.  Thanks to 'rccatalyst' for providing it.  I'm copying it here, because apple support just hasn't worked for me.  The thread linked above it 4 years old and yet it hasn't turned up in any of my FAQ/google/KB searches.  OK, so basically, go into terminal and run the commands below.  Open 'Terminal' from Finder or wherever.  cd ~/Library/Keychains  ls   (When you 'ls' here you will see a folder that contains a bunch of random number like so: 94ED610F-DD96-4ECF-A2BC-7D2F8653A464  (this number is unique on each system))  rm -rf 94ED610F-DD96-4ECF-A2BC-7D2F8653A464 (i.e. whatever your code is)  Now reboot your mac.  When you log back in everything should be back to normal
