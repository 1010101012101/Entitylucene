Can the OS X Mail dock count be made to show all (not just unread) count of inbox? <body> A few other e-mail applications allow you to set their dock counter to the number of messages in the inbox, rather than just the number of unread messages. The idea being that until it's out of the inbox, it's still an active task that needs to be resolved.  So what I'm after is the ability to do this with Mail.app in OS X Mavericks. Currently there's only a drop-down preference for:  precodeDock unread count: Inbox only                    All Mailboxes /code/pre  Perhaps there's a plug-in or some other app that allows you to override the inbox count with the total count?  Unfortunately, searching on Google for anything to do with the inbox count just brings up hundreds of posts about how the count is wrong/not showing. Hard to find anything useful amongst countless pages about bugs.  <answer134418> I would recommend you try this script first.  You can modify the output report to your desire (not email it to your self).  The reason I recommend this is, if you are anything like me and have multiple accounts with hundreds of folders and thousands of emails the badge count could be confusing.  I just run it on my MBA and it took a while but the produced a 3 pages report of ALL emails in all accounts in all folders, while differentiating between read and Unread.  precodetell application "Mail" set localMailboxes to every mailbox if (count of localMailboxes) is greater than 0 then set messageCountDisplay to "Local mailboxes (On My Mac)" &amp; return &amp; my getMessageCountsForMailboxes(localMailboxes) else set messageCountDisplay to "" end if  set everyAccount to every account repeat with eachAccount in everyAccount set accountMailboxes to every mailbox of eachAccount if (count of accountMailboxes) is greater than 0 then set messageCountDisplay to messageCountDisplay &amp; return &amp; "Mailboxes for Account: " &amp; name of eachAccount &amp; return &amp; my getMessageCountsForMailboxes(accountMailboxes) end if end repeat  set outputMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {content:messageCountDisplay, subject:"Message counts for all my mailboxes", visible:true} tell outputMessage set font to "Courier" set size to 12 end tell end tell  on getMessageCountsForMailboxes(theMailboxes) -- (list of mailboxes) -- returns string  set displayString to ""  tell application "Mail" repeat with eachMailbox in theMailboxes set mailboxName to name of eachMailbox set messageCount to (count of (messages of eachMailbox)) as string set unreadCount to unread count of eachMailbox as string  set displayString to displayString &amp; " " &amp; my padString(mailboxName, 40) &amp; " " &amp; messageCount &amp; " (" &amp; unreadCount &amp; " unread)" &amp; return end repeat end tell  return displayString end getMessageCountsForMailboxes  on padString(theString, fieldLength) -- (string, integer) -- returns string  set stringLength to length of theString  if stringLength is greater than fieldLength then set paddedString to (text from character 1 to character (fieldLength - 3) of theString) &amp; "..." else -- stringLength is less than or equal to fieldLength set paddedString to theString  set paddingLength to fieldLength - stringLength repeat paddingLength times set paddedString to paddedString &amp; space end repeat end if  return paddedString end padString /code/pre  Source:  Here is a snippet of what it looks like (me blocking my personal information)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SgQWw.png" alt="mail count"  <answer140066> In system preferences, go to Notifications.  Click on the Mail application, then check the box to the right that says "badge app icon."  That's it.  Just worked for me.    <answer148306> DockStar solved the issue for me. It now has an update to support both Mavericks and Yosemite when it comes out. I only tested in on Mavericks though, works great.  The great thing for me was that I have exactly 4 inboxes, so I can add a badge for all of them.  <answer276069> I managed to find a workaround: I have an AppleScript running every 10 minutes on my machine to set ALL my Inbox emails to status: unread. This updates the Dock badge icon. Since I follow the Inbox Zero philosophy, I don't care if emails I've read get marked unread.  code tell application "Mail"     set read status of every message of inbox to false end tell /code  I run it every 10 minutes on Mac using this excellent lanchd scheduling tool: LaunchControl by Soma Zone software.  <comment157695> For pre-Mavericks users, [DockStar](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/dockstar/) may solve the issue, but it's no longer supported from Mavericks onwards. <comment165102> That just shows the unread count, not all messages in the inbox.
