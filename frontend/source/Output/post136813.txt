Banish "You have forced XXX to quit" from showing on my screen again <body> I never want to see this popup on my computer again.  Is it possible to prevent "do not ask again" this type of dialog?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UEXh9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer136814> Run the following, then log out and back in  precodedefaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType none /code/pre  <comment162413> Does this affect error reporting to Apple? <comment162414> @Patience If the dialog would automatically send the report to Apple, the report will still be sent. If the report is only sent if you click Report (i.e. it's a third party app) then the report will not be sent. <comment162417> Prerelease software often has many, many bugs. Would you be able to indicate the build / version of OS X you are running in case this is reproducible on 10.9 or earlier? <comment162426> @GeorgeGarside Apple's advice differs from what you suggest. *Help Center* content for Mavericks includes: [Report problems to Apple](https://help.apple.com/machelp/mac/10.9/help/index.html?lang=en#mh27990) with help for automatic reporting and more. <comment162427> @Graham Could you expand on what you're quoting from the link? It appears to *support* what I was saying? <comment162436> This screenshot is from 10.10b2 but I see this same behavior in 10.9 <comment162444> Clarification/discussion: http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/16397024#16397024
