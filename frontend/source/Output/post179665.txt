MacBook Pro 2011 - can't install after erasing system disk <body> I just got my MacBook Pro back after lending it to a friend, and restarted with Cmd+R.    I erased my system disk and now i'm trying to install Mavericks.    For two times it downloaded the "Additional Updates" (it takes three hours with my internet connection) and after finishing downloading it just goes back to the initial screen - Restore from time machine backup, reinstall OS X (which just repeats the download), Get help Online and Disk Utility.  I could try installing Lion from USB, but i don't think i should have to pay for it and i'm afraid i buy it and download it and somehow it won't work.  I'm stuck here, i'm desperate.   <comment213100> What's wrong with Restore from Time Machine? <comment213101> i don't have any backup made <comment213102> OK, then your choices would seem to be OS 10.7, that was on the machine when new, or Yosemite. Mavericks is not an option without an existing bootable installer. <comment213103> when i try restore from Base System, it says resource busy... <comment213105> I've never been at the same stage, but that would make me think the Recovery partition was somehow damaged - leaving Internet Recovery or an existing bootable USB stick the remaining choices. <comment213106> but is there a reason, why after the download nothing happens? <comment213140> Do you or do you not have a bootable USB with Mavericks on it ? Considering your Internet speeds it is probably stuck there.
