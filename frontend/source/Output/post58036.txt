How to make Mail.app to delete Gmail messages to trash when pressing the keyboard delete button? <body> When I accidentally pressed delete on mail in Mail it removed the incoming mail permanently!   How can I change this behaviour so that when I press delete on the keyboard, it will remove it from the inbox to a trash folder, and not delete it forever(it was deleted it from my gmail server, so I couldn't restore it!)  I'm used to such behaviour from Outlook.  <answer58049> It sounds like you're using Gmail, in which case, have you checked the All Mail folder? Gmail treats things a little differently, and I believe the default action for "delete" when using Mail.app with Gmail is actually what Google calls "archive".  It doesn't delete it from the server, it just removes it from all folders (labels in Gmail-speak), but the message still lives in the All Mail folder.Check there for your messages, and you may find this previous answer helpful: Set up Gmail to work properly with Apple Mail  If you're not using Gmail, or that didn't work, try this:  ul liIn Mail, open the strongPreferences/strong (kbd⌘ command/kbd-kbd,/kbd)/li liIn the Preferences window, click the Accounts panel and select the applicable account in the sidebar as shown here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/be5Wr.png" alt="Mail preferences panels"/li liSelect the strongMailbox Behaviours/strong tab/li liMake sure the emMove deleted messages to the Trash Mailbox/em setting is checked: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XxpUv.png" alt="Trash settings"/li /ul  If it's already checked, make sure your Trash is set up properly, by selecting the mailbox you want in the main sidebar, then goto the strongMailbox/strong Menu, and choose strongUse This Mailbox For ‣ Trash/strong. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hly67.png" alt="Mailbox menu"  That should fix it. If not, your problem may be on the mail server, or something more obscure locally.  <comment66834> Thank you very very much - that was really helpful! :-)
