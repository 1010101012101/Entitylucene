Move to Start of Line in Terminal.app <body> Is there a quick key combo that will allow me after typing some stuff in the OSX terminal to move back to the beginning of that line?  I have tried different things, and was wondering if there is a way without setting up something that is custom.  <answer8929> kbdCTRL/kbd+kbda/kbd moves to the beginning of the line, kbdCTRL/kbd+kbde/kbd to the end of the line.  <comment9482> BTW, it also works in any Cocoa control (text area, etc.) <comment9510> Haha.  That easy, huh?  Thanks.  My Linux habits and kbdcommand/kbd+kbdleft/kbd from the OSX GUI made me scratch my head. <comment233097> why, my god? why?
