How to get iTunes to reconnect after buffering? <body> If I am streaming internet radio and iTunes looses the signal it will try to reconnect and then just gives up and moves to the next track in the playlist of internet songs.   Is there a way to change iTunes config so that it continues trying to reconnect rather than just giving up? Like a time-out perhaps?  I am running iTunes 11.3.1.2 on Windows 7  <answer143324> It is not possible to change the time-out within iTunes easily. But there is another solution to your problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ngQ1x.png" alt="iTunes internet songs playlist"  h1Create a playlist of an internet stream/h1  ul liGo to the iTunes Internet tab./li liSelect your radiostation/li liGet Info (File - Get Info, or kbdCommand/kbdkbdI/kbd)/li liIn the info screen, select the Summary section/li liRight click the URL next to strongWhere:/strong, 'Copy URL'/li liNow open this stream (File - Open Stream, or kbdCommand/kbdkbdU/kbd, paste, OK)/li /ul  This should create a new playlist "Internet Songs". As it only contains 1 'Internet Song', this should keep your from skipping to the next stream.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bauT0.png" alt="iTunes info screen"  <comment168775> This was the first radio station I could find <comment168792> Seems kinda hacky but might work.. There is no config setting that would just retry the existing stream? <comment168802> Not that I know of. You might be able to 'hack' some plist settings. Btw, I thought this a pretty clean way to handle the problem. <comment168948> This is a pretty elegant solution. Practical, easy to understand, easy to implement. <comment169292> @snowgage, does it work? <comment169389> My question asks if there is a way to do this my changing an iTunes config parameter not be creating a playlist. <comment169462> And that is not possible, therefor this solution.
