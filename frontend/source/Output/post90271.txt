How Do I associate all files with Emacs? <body> I'd like to be able to open any file with emacs as a choice when I right click it, regardless of environment.  <answer90275> It appears that this apple.stackexchange topic covers how to add items to the "Open With" menu.  <comment105978> If you are looking for a general solution, the linked questions should help. If you have a specific version of emacs (or want to click to have /usr/bin/emacs open), please edit those details into the question so we can focus on this specific example.
