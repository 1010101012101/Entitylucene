After stuck "Partitioning disk" by Boot Camp <body> I use a MacBook Pro Late 2011 with OS X El Capitan (10.11.4).  I wanted to install Windows using codeBoot Camp Assistant/code. strongHowever, I got stuck at codePartitioning disk.../code./strong It seems that it is a very common problem, and there are many threads on the web concerning this. Here is the screenshot I took while stuck:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HeSm3.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I had to Force Quit Boot Camp Assistant, and restarted my machine. I checked codeDisk Utility/code, it seems that I have not lost the 100GB I reserved for Windows, it is still in the available 133.05GB. Besides, I am not observing any abnormal behaviour of my system so far.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJrWS.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ustRT.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongDoes anyone know what I should do to make sure everything regarding the disk is fine (I don't see codeRepair/code in Disk Utility)?/strong  The partitioning thing freaks me out. Is there any expert who knows what to do with Boot Camp Assistant if I still want to install Windows?  strongEdit 1:/strong Following the suggestion of the comment,   1) codediskutil verifyvolume disk0/code on a terminal returns  precodeError starting file system verification for disk0: Invalid request (-69886) /code/pre  2) codediskutil verifyvolume disk1/code on a terminal returns the follows:  precodeStarted file system verification on disk1 Macintosh HD Verifying storage system Checking volume disk0s2: Scan for Volume Headers disk0s2: Scan for Disk Labels Logical Volume Group 6CF2AE08-886C-4B33-8EC1-3395CC80B6C7 on 1 device disk0s2: Scan for Metadata Volume Logical Volume Group has a 24 MB Metadata Volume with double redundancy Start scanning metadata for a valid checkpoint Load and verify Segment Headers Load and verify Checkpoint Payload Load and verify Transaction Segment Incorporate 0 newer non-checkpoint transactions Load and verify Virtual Address Table Load and verify Segment Usage Table Load and verify Metadata Superblock Load and verify Logical Volumes B-Trees Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volume Load and verify 7F2AFA2C-C0DE-4D0C-A855-7B1FA17B62D9 Load and verify 25A6AAE1-11B9-4661-AD24-DA9D08EF454D Load and verify Freespace Summary Load and verify Block Accounting Load and verify Live Virtual Addresses Newest transaction commit checkpoint is valid Load and verify Segment Cleaning The volume 6CF2AE08-886C-4B33-8EC1-3395CC80B6C7 appears to be OK Storage system check exit code is 0 Verifying file system Using live mode Performing live verification Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume Checking extents overflow file Checking catalog file Checking multi-linked files Checking catalog hierarchy Checking extended attributes file Checking volume bitmap Checking volume information File system check exit code is 0 Finished file system verification on disk1 Macintosh HD /code/pre  <comment291388> If you can not get the Boot Camp Assistant to partition your disk, then try using the Disk Utility application. You need to create a MSDOS(FAT) formatted partition named BOOTCAMP. Choose your size carefully. If you need to resize this partition later, you find this to be extremely difficult without the use of third party tools. If you can get past this hurdle, the rest is fairly easy. <comment291389> It also appears you are using core storage. This added level of complexity is not required unless you have a Fusion drive or need encryption. <comment291450> Thank you... Before partitioning (again) my disk, is there any way to make sure that the previous interruption of partitioning by Boot Camp did not cause any damage and my current disk is all right? <comment291562> You should ask this as a separate question. I will try to answer as a comment. Boot to your recovery partition or use internet recovery. Open Disk Utility, select volume, click on Info button, record BSD device node and close Disk Utility. From menu bar open Terminal application, enter `diskutil  verifyvolume  diskx` where `diskx` is the recorded BSD device node. If repair is needed, backup important files. To repair, either: Enter command `diskutil  repairvolume  diskx` or the following. Quit Terminal, open Disk Utility, highlight volume and select "First Aid" button. <comment291565> I added the result of `diskutil verifyvolume` in OP: i guess for `disk0` the result is normal?; for `disk1`, it looks good... <comment291566> For the `core storage`, is it because I have installed `Parallels Desktop`? In this case, can I still partition my disk (with Disk Utility)? <comment291571> The images you posted show `disk0` to be a physical disk and `disk1` to be the volume "Macintosh HD". Running `diskutil verifyvolume` on a disk should produce an error message. I have not used Parallels, but I do not think it is requires core storage. You can partition and install Windows on disks using core storage.
