Whats that percentage mean in iTunes Connect? <body> I'm starting to publish apps and I'm curious about this green number in iTunes Connect:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m0ksZ.png" alt="green"  I believe it indicates growth over three hundred something. Can someone explain what this is? Thanks!  <answer126208> This shows the change in units strongsince the prior range of data/strong. In the screenshot, 31 units is an increase of 343% over the previous data range.  <comment147797> Ok thank you very much!!!
