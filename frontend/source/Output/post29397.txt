Customizing the shell prompt causes some quirks <body> I have customized the shell prompt with the following code in my code~/.bash_profile/code, but there is one quirk left I can't seem to fix:  precodeexport PS1="\u:\[\e[32;1;32m\W\e[m\] \$ " /code/pre  (code is also on github)  This works well, including for long commands. But if I page through the command history with the arrow keys, the prompt will sometimes get a bit "weird". Sometimes it will include a partial command in the prompt or other times the space after the code$/code will be disappear. Is there something missing from the code above that I should tweak?  Thanks!  <answer29404> You didn't close the brackets for the first escape, and add the escape for the second  precodeexport PS1="\u:\[\e[32;1;32m\]\W\[\e[m\] \$ " #---------------------------^^--^^ /code/pre  <comment33752> Thank you! Was going cross-eyed trying to get it all to work. :)
