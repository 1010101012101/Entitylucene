Imessage delivery status <body> When an imessage doesn't display delivered or not delivered beneath the message, will it update if and when the recipient is able to recieve iMessages again?  <answer90581> If the message was strongdelivered/strong, whenever the recipient reads it, a strongRead [Date]/strong will automatically be displayed beneath. Bear in mind, as Emil points out in the comments, that for this behaviour to happen, the receiver must have the strongSend Read Receipts/strong option enabled.   If the message is marked as strongnot delivered/strong, it means that, for some reason, that message couldn't be sent. Although you emsolve/em the issue, it wont be automatically sent, therefore requiring you to tap on the emexclamation mark/em and choosing strongTry Again/strong.   <comment106335> That depends, if the reciever allows sending read-confirmations, it will display as _Read [date/time]_, but if it does not send read-confirmations, it will simply display _Delivered_. <comment106336> @Emil True. I forgot about that. I'll edit my answer pointing that out.
