Missing a lot of options from Finder's right click context menu <body> No idea what caused this or why it's happening, but when I right click something in Finder  I'm missing a lot of the standard options that should be there (dropbox options, labels, etc). I've restarted several times, relaunched Finder, repaired disk permissions, and nothing's worked.

Do you have the latest version of Dropbox? Reinstall Dropbox with the newest version.     Dropbox uses a "hack" which extends the Finder (in an unsupported way) to provide this "sharing" link.  Because these "hacks" can cause crashes, Apple tends to disable them when newer versions of OS X ship. There's probably a newer version of DropBox that gets around these restrictions that you'll need to download.   supSource: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5577081/sup  <answer133295> Will, are you using TotalFinder? I had the same problem and it was caused by TotalFinder. Upgrading to version 1.6 solved it.  <answer168974> ol liQuit dropbox./li liTerminal:/li /ol     $ sudo rm -rf /Library/DropboxHelperTools   ol start="3" liTerminal:/li /ol     $ killall finder   ol start="4" liOpen Dropbox./li liEnter Admin PWD when prompted.

Does it still occur? <comment154447> I only have my one account on this computer, but I enabled the guest account and logged in. Everything seemed to be working normally there. <comment154449> From the Finder Menu Bar (in your user account)  Go...  Go To Folder  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist  **delete** the file, log out, and log back in. Any difference? <comment154456> Just tried deleting that file and logged out, still having the same issue. <comment154460> Reboot in **Safe Mode.** Log in. Same issue? <comment154465> Booted into Safe Mode and everything was working normally (no issue). Booted back into "regular" mode and everything is working fine there too. Doesn't explain what exactly fixed the issue though... I've had it happen a few times before and it fixed itself, I only asked about it this time to see if I could permanently fix it somehow. <comment154466> Reinstalled dropbox, rebooted, still had the issue. Then I followed someone's suggestion above to boot into safe mode to see if the issue was present there. It wasn't, then I booted back into OSX regularly and for some reason the issue wasn't present there either. No idea what fixed it or if it'll continue... <comment154470> Scratch that. Now it's not working, and I haven't logged out or rebooted since it was working. <comment154471> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/14654/discussion-between-njboot-and-will-ryan). <comment154472> Scratch that, not working anymore. <comment154500> I looked at your  etrecheck feed. You have a ton of user specific launchagents, launchdaemons, and login items. I can't identify a specific culprit, but it makes sense given 1) it doesn't occur in another account and 2) it doesn't occur in safe mode. <comment159758> ^ TotalFinder was causing this issue for me.
