Where does MacVim keep its themes? <body> I'm using MacVim and I am attempting to change the default theme. I have the following in my code.vimrc/code file (and in code.gvimrc/code as well):  precode colorscheme macvim /code/pre  But the theme remains unchanged. What am I doing wrong?  The file is read in without errors but the scheme doesn't change. Also, if I download alternate themes, where do they go?  <answer38851>    Where does macvim keep it's themes?   The themes that MacVim ships with can be found in   precode/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/colors /code/pre  but MacVim will also load any custom themes you have on disk. I use the rather awesome Janus plugin distribution with MacVim and Janus keeps all of its themes in code~/.vim/janus/vim/colors/code. MacVim will load this in as well as the defaults.     But the theme remains unchanged. What am I doing wrong?   MacVim loads both code~/.vimrc/code and code~/.gvimrc/code, in that order. Make sure that settings in code~/.gvimrc/code aren't clobbering settings you're making in your code~/.vimrc/code file.  <answer38864> By default, you should put custom colorschemes/themes into: code~/.vim/colors/code  Note that you may need to create the code.vim/code directory in your home directory if it does not already exist.  After doing so, your :colorscheme command should automatically pick up the theme.  <answer38878> This is what I have in my ~/.vimrc  precodeif has("gui_running")   syntax on   set hlsearch   colorscheme macvim   set bs=2   set ai   set ruler endif /code/pre  <answer136182> The easiest way is to create a code~/.gvimrc/code file and add    precodecolorscheme solarized /code/pre  or whatever colorscheme you want. That's all I had to do to get my codebrewed/code version of codemacvim/code working again. I had a conditional like the one at the top of the thread and that worked for sometime, but recently ( I think after an upgrade to OSX ) I had to add the code.gvimrc/code file to get OceanicNext to work.
