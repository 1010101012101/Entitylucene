iPad unable to show system notifications or lock/unlock <body> For months, I have been unable to do several things with my iPad mini 2 (on various versions of iOS 10), all of which, I have discovered, are related to one problem. Something is inhibiting the operating system to send me notifications (though non-Apple apps work just fine). This means that I can’t delete apps normally, because that involves accepting an alert that appears. I can’t install new apps, because I can’t accept the confirmation dialog. This list goes on for quite a long time. Another seemingly unrelated issue is that locking and unlocking the device works abnormally. To turn on the display, I have to hold down the power button, and nothing is displayed in the screen until the “Slide to power off” screen appears. I have to close that before I can put in my passcode. I can’t use the button to turn off the display either; I have to wait for the automatic locking to trigger.   Today, I unplugged the iPad, and the display could be turned on without having to use the power button. For several minutes, I had no problem doing things such as deleting and installing apps. However, after a few minutes, the display abruptly turned off while I was using it, and I had to hold down the power button and close the “Slide to power off” menu again, and all system notification issues returned. I can’t figure out what was different about the situation. Has this situation happened to anyone else? What is blocking the use of the power button and notifications?
