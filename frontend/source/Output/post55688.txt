Unable to unmount drive! <body> Somehow my harddrive seems to fail, I am not able to startup anymore. When I started in verbose mode, I noticed that the harddrive return I/O Errors and the B-Node-Tree seems to be corrupted.  I was able to use the single-user mode to backup files to an external harddrive, but when I tried to repartition the harddrive from the recovery mode, after failing to repair the partitions in single-user mode, I get an error, that he is unable to unmount the drive.  (DiskWarrior 4.4 doesn't even recognize the Macintosh HD and the S.M.A.R.T Test results are alright)  I first thought maybe something is actually used on that drive, but even after trying to repartition from the Disk Utility on a Mac OSX Lion Installer DVD, he keeps telling me, that he is unable to unmount the drive.  (I had a bootcamp partition on the harddrive as well, that is still highlighted, so that seems to be the issue)  The system is an early 2011 MBP.  <answer55757> Open Terminal and try entering following:  precodedf /code/pre  which will give a listing of your mounted volumes similar to:  precodeFilesystem    512-blocks       Used  Available Capacity  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2  1951845952 1655141456  296192496    85%    / devfs                477        477          0   100%    /dev map -hosts             0          0          0   100%    /net map auto_home          0          0          0   100%    /home /dev/disk1s2  1952853344  754604936 1198248408    39%    /Volumes/Backup /code/pre  depending on which drive you need to unmount you can then try:  precodesudo hdiutil eject -force /dev/disk1s2 /code/pre  which would force /Volumes/Backup to be unmounted.  <comment255583> This  "hdiutil eject -force mounted drive name" worked like charm.  I had mounted SSHFS, tried to umount it, but somehow encountered error.  I even tried to kill the process, but still the error persisted.  However, hdiutil did the task.  thanks
