Deleted all user accounts from Mac by mistake <body> I have Mac laptop. My child deleted all user accounts from it? How I can set up a new user to access my laptop. I have tried power+command+R to reset password but it does not allow me to do it. It says not user available.  <comment342273> Possible duplicate of [I don't have administrator account on my mac](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/164331/i-dont-have-administrator-account-on-my-mac). This also works if all accounts are moved/erased/renamed. Hint: [Restore from backup?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2927/restore-from-backup)
