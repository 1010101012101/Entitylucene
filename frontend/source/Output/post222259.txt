Credentials popup keeps popping up after El Capitan upgrade <body> Display of problem here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU_d1P-qX1s (10 seconds long)  I'm a developer and have all sorts of programs installed, including codeSourceTree/code and codeGitHub/code's desktop app.  Unfortunately, in the last few days, since upgrading to codeEl Capitan/code this continues to happen to me.  When I'm working, or just using the computer at all, a credentials question pops up front and centre, asking me if I want to allow codegit-credential-sourcetree/code access to codegithub.com/code in my codekeychain/code, full message  precodegit-credential-sourcetree wants to use your confidential information stored in "github.com" in your keychain.  Do you want to allow access to this item?  Always Allow | Deny | Allow /code/pre  My first click, and preference is codeAlways allow/code, but if I click that, or codeAllow/code, nothing seems to happen.  Only when I click codeDeny/code does the prompt seem to take on board what my choice is.  After I click codeDeny/code, the popup disappears, but always pops up once more, and only stays away if I click codeDeny/code again, as shown in the clip.  It's really distracting and irritating, especially given that I really do want codeSourceTree/code to be able to access that login information (codeSourceTree/code was the original program I inputted my login information for codeGithub/code).  <answer222562> I've received the answer to my problem from finchr's post at https://discussions.apple.com/message/29270520#29270520,     In my case the problem was with MagicPrefs, a utility that lets you define additional mouse and trackpad gestures.  Disabling MagicPrefs allows Keychain to see Allow/Allow All mouse clicks.   Which was the very same for me.  I haven't permanently disabled, or uninstalled MagicPrefs, I just disable it when I need to click one of those boxes.  Hopefully they or Apple will come out with an update that fixes this.  <comment281436> Same issue here - but no MagicPrefs
