Cannot Remove Configuration Profile On iPhone <body> I worked at a company that used GOOD For Enterprise. I installed it on my iPhone 5s and now that I've left the company, would like to remove the profile. I've deleted the GOOD application, but I cannot remove the profile. There is no red "Remove" button like all of the tutorials show. I just did a full wipe and restored the phone with my iCloud profile and sure enough, it's still my one and only configuration profile on my phone. How do I get this off of here?
