Finder/Quicklook Bug (File Icon Previews Not Working) <body> My Macbook has suddenly stopped generating preview icon of all file types. So all files are now replaced by their respective generic file type icons (see picture attached). Moreover, when I quicklook any file, the preview appears corrupted.   I have not updated any software recently, nor have I modified any file systems.   Any help would be much appreciated!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfqWU.jpg" alt="Corrupted Quicklook and Icons"  <answer229222> Per comment under original question, first thing I'd try (which turned out to be the solution) would be to run codesudo qlmanage -r/code in a terminal, which resets the QuickLook subsystem.  <answer229300> Merely running sudo qlmanage -r did not fix this issue for me.  For me, the direct cause was QLStephen.qlgenerator. The issue happened overnight and I suspect Apple's latest silent OS X update may have played a part in this. I removed the plugin the same way I installed it (Homebrew); if you manually installed it, simply drag it out of the plugins folder in your Library and run sudo qlmanage -r  Thong.qlgenerator also caused an issue for me (PNG only showed as an icon).  <comment279574> First thing I'd try would be to run "sudo qlmanage -r" in a terminal, which will reset the QuickLook subsystem. <comment279584> @scottishwildcat that did the trick! Much thanks! <comment279590> Cool... I'll add it as a proper answer then, didn't think it'd be that easy :)
