MacPorts fails to find 'make' <body> I've installed Xcode and MacPorts on a brand new mid-2013 MacBook Air, but MacPorts doesn't work, saying that it cannot find anything.  precodemba:~ cnst$ sudo port install wget Warning: The Command Line Tools for Xcode don't appear to be installed; most ports will likely fail to build. Warning: See http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.xcode.html for more information. ---&gt;  Computing dependencies for wgetError: Unable to execute port: can't read "build.cmd": Failed to locate 'make' in path: '/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin' or at its MacPorts configuration time location, did you move it? mba:~ cnst$ /code/pre  And, indeed, there is no codemake/code or codeclang/code in the path, but it is definitely installed, though:  precodemba:~ cnst$ find /Applications -name "clang" -or -name "make" /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make mba:~ cnst$ /code/pre  Why is there no make or clang in the path?  Why MacPorts doesn't work?  I notice that http://www.macports.org/install.php#pkg mentions that you have to install something from ADC, codeApple Command Line Developer Tools/code, but ADC doesn't work since last Thursday or Friday due to their security breach, so, the developer tools are nowhere to be found.  What's the proper solution here?  <answer97144> Due to the Apple Developer Center being down this process may fail, however;  You can install Command Line Tools via Xcode's Preferences. Open Xcode, then hit kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbd,/kbd. Choose the 'Downloads' section, and Components lists the downloadable items.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dKtB3.png" alt="Xcode Downloadable Components"  Assuming that ADC being down hasn't also locked down these utilities, the installation process will take place.  <comment113969> This won't solve your problem with a lack of `make`, `clang`, etc., but you should really consider switching to [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). <comment113971> See also: http://kennethreitz.org/xcode-gcc-and-homebrew/ <comment113972> It's downloading something at 17.8MB/s!  I think only their authorisation services are down, I wonder how does Xcode do these downloads -- maybe it's also possible to download Xcode itself without having to use the App Store? <comment113973> Yes, it worked!  ADC / Software Downloads is still offline, BTW.
