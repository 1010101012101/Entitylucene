Is there a way to lock a folder's icon without making its contents Read Only? <body> I have a network share that is used by a large group of kids. They love changing the icon of this folder, which causes a lot of debate. I know that there is a hidden file that specifies the icon; can I lock this file so the icon of the folder can't be changed anymore?  <answer11269> You're exactly right. Here's how to lock the file that controls the icon:  brShow hidden files. brNavigate to your folder. brThere will be a file called codeIcon/code inside it. brGo to the Get Info window for that file and check the Locked checkbox. brTry to change the icon. You can't. Ta-da.  <comment11828> Thanks! For a volume's icon it looks like the file is called .VolumeIcon.icn rather than Icon, but other than that it works exactly like you said.
