is there an easier way to set PRAM? <body> I was trying to solve a stupid nagging problem (doesn't matter what at this point!) on my iMac (mid 2011), and one of the things that kept popping up is resetting PRAM. I have done this many times (over the years) and it is always a frustrating task (and getting harder as my coordination gets worse.) as I have hand/finger difficulties. One hand (the right) is cramped and mostly useless while the other is somewhat shaky. This combined with trouble with eye/hand coordination makes hitting the kbdcommand/kbd + kbdoption/kbd + kbdp/kbd + kbdr/kbd at just the strongright time/strong and strongemall the way through/em/strong the boot process very difficult for me. I would love to be able to set a keyboard shortcut to do that but don't think it is possible. If I could use one hand (the LEFT) to do that it would be great. I have looked in System Preferences under Keyboard and Accessibility as well as Googled but an easier solution has not revealed itself. Maybe there is none.  <answer200754> I found an answer here, How to reset mac PRAM through the command line in Lion/Mountain Lion?, that seems to work in Yosemite.

In Terminal: sudo nvram -c <comment241965> But, you still need to reboot in order to rebuild the rvram. Be careful. <comment241969> Yes, a reboot is needed. <comment241972> That is beyond my limited knowledge and will require research at the least. :)
