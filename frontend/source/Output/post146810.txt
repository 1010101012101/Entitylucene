How do I stop iOS updates nagging me? <body> iOS7 allows you to delete the iOS8 update package if it has been automatically downloaded to your iPhone (Settings  General  Software Update  Delete). However, then Apple insists on notifying you again of the availability of the iOS8 update (though without downloading it), which means you permanently have a "1" by the Settings icon.  Is there a way of blocking this notification?  <answer146811> strongThis is currently not possible./strong  If your device is jailbroken, you can install emSoftware Update Killer/em or any number of badge-removing tweaks.
