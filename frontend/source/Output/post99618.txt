Cisco VPN timeout issues <body> I'm trying to use the native Cisco VPN client installed with Lion and it's been a terrible experience. The VPN times out between 15 and 45 minutes and I can't seem to fix it. I've followed guides for fixing this problem and it's gotten me nowhere. I copied the .conf files for each VPN that I have and disabled dead peer detection, changed proposal check to claim, and increased the lifetime time to 5 hours. I also changed my racoon.conf file to look in the directory where my custom .conf files are. I could stay connected all day when I used Ubuntu and I'd really like to have that ability back.  Is there a 3rd party client that I could use other than the Cisco one? I don't want to boot into 32-bit mode. Is there another fix that I missed?  <answer99620> There is Cisco AnyConnect, which replaces the native VPN client. There is also a standalone Cisco VPN client for Mac.  Link  <comment117274> Could you add what happenned at the time of failure? Please include the relevant parts of the useful logs for this trouble shooting (most probably `/var/log/system.log`).
