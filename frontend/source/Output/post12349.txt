Ordering prints other than through iphoto <body> I would like to order photo prints off of iphoto through phanfare because I like their quality of prints better than iphoto/kodak. Is there a way to do this?  <answer12350> Phanfare have an iPhoto plugin  http://www.phanfare.com/apps.aspx#Iphoto  So you can export to them directly from iPhoto.
