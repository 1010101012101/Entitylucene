Why does Notes only show a sub-set of the Share extensions enabled on my Mac? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ydQFZ.png" alt="My Share menu in Safari"  I'm really enjoying the new version of Notes.app, now that I can set the text size to something I can read. But one aspect continues to bug me, and maybe it's some setting I haven't found. The first image above shows the list of apps in my Share menu, as listed in Safari, but in Notes it is a smaller list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4xj3Z.png" alt="Share menu in Notes"  I would like the 'Add to Together' share item to be available to me in Notes.  <answer263043> It's up to the individual share extension developer to tell the system which inputs are compatible with their extension, and to then implement the necessary code to be compatible with each.  <comment329695> Thanks ... so I should ask the developer of Together this question?
