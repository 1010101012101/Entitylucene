How to properly increase ulimit -n on Lion? <body> I'm trying to download the X-Plane 10 Demo through uTorrent, however I get a "too many open files" error all the time. I can do the alternate download (which takes forever and a day), but I wonder how I can increase the setting in Lion?  I found conflicting information about it, some say that codeulimit -n/code and codesysctl/code are the tools of choice, while others report that codelaunchctl/code is correct.  The reported value for codeulimit -n/code is 256, same for codelaunchctl limit/code:  precodecpu         unlimited      unlimited       filesize    unlimited      unlimited       data        unlimited      unlimited       stack       8388608        67104768        core        0              unlimited       rss         unlimited      unlimited       memlock     unlimited      unlimited       maxproc     709            1064            maxfiles    256            unlimited       /code/pre  <answer32238> You could increase the maximum opened files by running codeulimit -n 1024/code and launching uTorrent from the command line.  In my case, I would launch Transmission using the command :  precode/Applications/Transmission.app/Contents/MacOS/Transmission /code/pre  You must launch the torrent application from the shell where you invoked ulimit, your changes have no effect otherwise, well isolating the changes is the advantage of ulimit.   <answer73688> The following should resolve most solutions (and are listed in order of their hierarchy):  precodeecho 'kern.maxfiles=20480' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf echo -e 'limit maxfiles 8192 20480\nlimit maxproc 1000 2000' | sudo tee -a /etc/launchd.conf echo 'ulimit -n 4096' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile /code/pre  Notes:  ol liYou will need to restart for these changes to take effect./li liAFAIK you can no longer set limits to 'unlimited' under OS X/li lilaunchctl maxfiles are bounded by sysctl maxfiles, and therefore cannot exceed them/li lisysctl seems to inherit kern.maxfilesperproc from launchctl maxfiles/li liulimit seems to inherit it's 'open files' value from launchctl by default/li liyou can set a custom ulimit within /etc/profile, or ~/.profile ; while this isn't required I've provided an example/li liBe cautious when setting any of these values to a very high number when compared with their default - the features exist stability/security.
