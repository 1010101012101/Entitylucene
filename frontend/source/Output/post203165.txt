How to override the delay timer on a Keynote slide during a presentation <body> Assume that you've set a Keynote (v 6.5.3) slide to automatically advance after 2 minutes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/djeKM.png" alt="enter image description here"  This works fine - until you realise during your presentation that you've finished early and are ready to move onto the next slide.  How can you strongoverride the delay timer/strong, and force the slide to move on?  Keynote ignores any key-press or slide remote, and doggedly waits the 2 minutes before advancing.  (emIn PowerPoint you can set an auto-advance-after-delay, but override it during a presentation using the keyboard or a slide remote - this is the behaviour I'm trying to emulate/em)  <answer204379> Try this:  kbdshift/kbd+kbdâ†“/kbd during playback.  hr / strongEDIT:/strong  These are the Navigation keyboard shortcuts for use during presentation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hqlRz.png" alt="Screenshot of keyboard shortcuts for navigation of Keynote presentations"  <comment246364> Thanks for the tip - but it's not working for me on a stand-alone 2014 MBP running Yosemite and the latest Keynote. Are you using presentation mode (ie with an external display)? <comment246366> Yep, same setup as you, but it seems temperamental.  It didn't work when starting the slide show at the slide in question. <comment246367> I just edited the shortcut.  This works better than the option + ] shortcut. <comment246370> Glad it worked!!
