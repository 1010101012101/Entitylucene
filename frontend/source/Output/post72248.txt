Change quality of built-in recording script <body> I've recently bought ScreenFlow, but I noticed that the recording quality is horrible, and even worse when uploaded to Youtube.  After some research I have to the conclusion that it records using Mac OSX Mountain Lion's screen capturing script that most programs use to record the screen.  So my question is, how do I change the quality at which this script records? I don't mind hacking stuff.  If this is not possible, what would be a good stand-alone program that can record by it's own account, not depending on this screen capturing script.  Thanks for your help!  <answer72272> I downloaded a trial version of ScreenFlow, and it looks like there are a few ways to improve the video quality.  h2YouTube Export/h2  If you're using the YouTube publishing option, be sure to check the strongPublish in 720p/1080p/strong option: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sOhxO.png" alt="YouTube quality options"  If you don't have that selected, the video will be downscaled by YouTube to 360p. You may also want to check the strongLetterbox/strong option to maintain the aspect ratio on YouTube.  h2Custom Export/h2  You can gain more control over the export options by using the strongExport/strong option, in the emFile/em menu (or ⌘E). There are various presets, I would suggest trying the emWeb - High/em option first, and see if that's to your taste. You'll also want to be sure to change the strongDimensions/strong settings, which by default are set to scale to 50%.  If you're wanting to put stuff on YouTube, I suggest exporting at your default resolution (emi.e./em 100% scaling) — YouTube will re-encode it anyway, but uploading the best source material is the best way to maintain quality. If you find the quality of the emWeb - High/em isn't sufficient, you can click the strongCustomize…/strong button, and increase the emDatarate/em setting.  h2Lossless Export w/ 3rd Party Tools/h2  Finally, if you're still not satisfied, you could ScreenFlow's lossless recording, and use an external tool to compress it. To enable lossless recording, open strongPreferences/strong, click emAdvanced/em and change the emScreen Recording Compression/em from emAdaptive/em to strongLossless/strong. Then when you export, use the emLossless/em preset (or emLossless - ProRes/em, although this format is not supported by as many tools). Then use another tool, such as Handbrake to tweak the settings as you desire.  Hopefully you can find something amongst these options that will get you the output you desire.  <comment83889> Are you using your Mac's built-in microphone? That's more likely to be the source of quality issues than the codecs involved. Test by recording a track in Garageband, and see if that quality is what you expect. <comment83891> I am using my headset's mic, but the problem is not the audio, it's the video. It's like it records at half the amount of pixels, at low quality (like watching fullscreen at 360p). <comment83896> Sorry, my brain seems to have inserted audio before "recording quality". <comment83898> No problem. :) So I guess you don't have a working answer then correct? <comment83905> EXCELLENT!! Sorry for all caps, but I've been searching for this for 2 days. It was the Lossless settings which made it low quality at recording. I will be sure to check out Handbrake. Thanks a lot! I can't believe Lossless was the option, well, I guess you should always try everything.
