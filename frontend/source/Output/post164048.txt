Spotlight does not seem to work in finding apps <body> I have a Spotlight to search for the applications.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yz0Li.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, nothing shows up when I searched the application.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2yYWg.png" alt="enter image description here"  What might be wrong? I use Yosemite, and I made sure that spotlight works with this command.   codesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist/code  <answer164171> A recent article on MacIssues suggests rebuilding the spotlight index in situations like this.  Briefly, the proposed solution is to go to the Spotlight preference pane (in System preferences) and add your disk drive to the privacy list, then remove it again.  The article also makes oblique reference to certain “Terminal-based approaches”. The obvious candidate is called codemdutil/code. You can use the code-E/code flag to erase the local metadata store for the named drive(s), or code-i off/code followed by code-i on/code to turn indexing off, then on. (Disclaimer: I have not tried this. Check the manual page.)  <comment192212> Maybe the [spotlight index needs to be rebuilt](http://www.macissues.com/2014/12/12/how-to-determine-when-your-spotlight-index-needs-to-be-rebuilt/)? <comment192213> @HaraldHanche-Olsen That seems likely to be the correct solution. Why don't you make it a proper answer instead of just a comment? :) <comment192365> @Thecafremo I didn't want to post just a link as an answer, and didn't have time to write more. Fixed now.
