iOS simulator always saves images on desktop <body> When pressed Command-S, the iOS simulator always saves screenshots on Desktop. How can I tell it to save it somewhere else?  <answer228274> You can't change the location where Simulator.app saves screenshots.  <answer228292> [Edit to add Automator steps]  You can't change the location, but I often use a little script like this to keep things tidy:  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash  destination=~/screenshots  while [ true ]; do     if [ -n "$(shopt -s nullglob; echo ~/Desktop/Simulator\ Screen\ Shot*.png)" ]; then         mv -v ~/Desktop/Simulator\ Screen\ Shot*.png "$destination";     fi     sleep 5 done /code/pre  Since you're using the iOS simulator you probably know how to create this as an executable script already, so I'll avoid giving those instructions.  If not, I might use Automator.  ul liCreate folder screenshots in your home directory/li liStart Automator and create a new Document of type Application/li liFind the Run Shell Script action and drag it from the actions on the left to the workspace on the right/li liPaste the shell script without the first line with #! stuff/li liSave it and run it from applications/li liYou should see the screen shot files be moved./li liHere's a visual. http://www.screencast.com/t/KEbAFifHCTcc/li /ul  <comment278820> Thank you! Actually I stick to xcode and spend as little time as possible with the Terminal app. Basically save as .command and run, right? <comment279016> Cool, since that is the case, I might use Automator. - Create folder screenshots in your home directory - Start Automator and create a new Document of type Application - Find the Run Shell Script action and drag it from the actions on the left to the workspace on the right - Paste the shell script without the first line with #! stuff - Save it and run it from applications - You should see the screen shot files be moved. - Here's a visual. http://www.screencast.com/t/KEbAFifHCTcc <comment279070> that was really sweet. Thank you!
