How to Boot Linux from usb stick on Macbook Pro early 2011 15'' (8,2)? <body> Macbook Pro early 2011 15'' (8,2) is known for its discreet AMD GPU failure. System with failing discreet GPU can be used with integrated GPU. Recently, using reverse engineering methods some developers were able to switch GPU usage for next boot (1). But this technique requires booting Macbook Pro into Windows or Linux. For this particular model of MacBook somehow I am not able to boot to Linux using USB. I tried a few methods but they did not work for me. Please let me know your detailed method if anyone was successful booting Linux this model from USB. My MacBook Pro is running El Capitan (Mac OS 10.11.3).  Different methods that I tried to boot from USB are detailed in following links:  DD Method for Ubuntu Linux USB Loader from Sevenbits  <comment279685> What does "they did not work for me" mean? You could not finish transferring the files to the USB? The USB flash drive does not appear when hold down the alt/option key a startup? You boot from flash drive but hangs during boot process? Which version of Ubuntu. Did you choose 32-bit or 64 bit and BIOS or GPT boot methods? <comment279696> When I used Linux USB Loader from Seventies, I could successfully create usb having Ubuntu (ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64-2). Using this USB I could boot my 2015 MacBook Pro, so I am sure this part worked fine. But when I used the same USB on 2011 15'' MBP I could not successfully boot or may be booted to blank screen as nothing was visible.
