Permission needed to change icons of native Apple apps <body> Okay so here's my problem. I want to change the icons of the Dashboard, Launcher, Quicktime, Notes, Mail etc. But when I paste my icon to the top left mini icon in the preview window (on the Get Info page) it won't let me.  Then I tried to change the permission settings to be able to edit the icon or change anything in the application folder but it tells me that i do not have the permission even tho I'm the sole user of the Mac.   I'm on El Capitan so I don't know if it's because of the new upgrade.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmdRJ.png" alt="I was trying to change the privilege of &quot;everyone&quot; to read &amp; Write"  <answer209997> ol liTurn off your Mac./li liBoot it in Recovery Mode by holding down ⌘-R until the Apple logo with a progress bar pops up./li liClick "Utilities" in the menu bar, and select Terminal./li liType the command "csrutil status" and press Enter. /li liIf enabled, type "csrutil disable"./li liPress Enter./li liClick the  in the menu bar and select Restart. /li liNow, the copy and paste method should work./li /ol  For more detailed instructions, check out http://hashbangstar.net/blog/changing-icons-in-el-capitan  You can also download a program called Liteicon from  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24764/liteicon  You still have to do steps 1-8 but it makes changing icons super easy! You can also easily change the Finder icon and Trash Can by using the drag and drop method.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HUL7T.png" alt="my current desktop with custom icons"  <comment253234> Apple Apps have special permissions to prevent you from easily deleting them which also prevents you from changing the icon. This has been the case for several previous versions, (if not all versions,) of Mac OS X. When you try to chuck an Apple app in the Trash, you get the message `“.app” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by OS X.` May I ask why you want to change the icons on all these apps? <comment253239> @Syma, Have you tried temporarily disabling [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection), change the icons and reenable SIP.  [System Integrity Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection) is new in OS X El Capitan. <comment253424> Nice color scheme and background image! +1
