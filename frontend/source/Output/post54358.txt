Global hotkey to change iTunes ratings <body> Is there a global hotkey or keyboard shortcut to change ratings in iTunes for the current song?  Some other applications (e.g. Amarok on Linux) have this and I'm missing this functionality from iTunes.  <answer54359> This post explains a way of doing exactly what you want. It's and old post, though, but it should still work.   <comment62208> Thanks - this almost worked. It works if I'm in iTunes and the song is selected in the playlist. Pressing `Command+5` will then change the rating of the selected song. It doesn't work if no song is selected (but a song is playing) or if iTunes is in Mini Player mode. I would like to be able to change the rating of the currently playing song. <comment62210> I guess a little improvement could be done to the scripts, using the actual playing song instead of the selected one. I'll try to find some time to test it. <comment126316> This only seems to work if you are in iTunes and the specific song is selected -- it's not a global shortcut. <comment335537> That method still works, but the page is dead.
