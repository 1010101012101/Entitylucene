When app get rating / review? <body> I have submitted an app to App Store. It has been downloaded almost 300 times. 5 in app purchase happened. But I do not get any review. I guess it depends on the users, whether they want to express their feelings or not. Is it any statistics when I can get the first review?  <answer170345> This depends entirely on the app.  ul liSome apps promote reviewing and get more reviews./li liSome apps are designed for kids and do not get as many reviews, but sometimes get more reviews due to parents reviewing the app./li liSome apps' market demographics means that the users are unlikely to review an app./li /ul  There's no single average time frame. It is entirely up to the user whether they review an app, although you can mention/promote reviewing in the app itself if you wish to expedite the process.  <comment200252> â€¦ though any app that nags me more than twice to 'review now' gets the 'never' button or goes in the bin if there isn't one.
