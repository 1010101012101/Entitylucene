iphone app icon size? <body> Can someone tell me what size icons I should be including in an iPhone app.  Can I assume also that I should include two resolutions?  Any help would be great, thanks.  <answer166787> These is a list of icon's resolution needed for iPhone, iPad and both of them.  ul li29x29 iphone/ipad/li li40x40 iphone/ipad/li li50x50 ipad/li li57x57 iphone/li li58x58 iphone/ipad/li li72x72 ipad/li li76x76 ipad/li li80x80 iphone/ipad/li li87x87 iphone/li li100x100 ipad/li li114x114 iphone/li li120x120 iphone/li li144x144 ipad/li li152x152 ipad/li li180x180 iphone/li /ul  To generate all of them, I recommend you an app called Prepo that accept a 1024x1024 and generate the ones you defined.  <comment195548> Thank you so much @jherran I am really only looking for the size and res that would be used as the icon used to start the app...... Thanks for the info on "Prepo" I will go and get it.
