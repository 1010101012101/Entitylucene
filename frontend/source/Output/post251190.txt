Dock freezes frequently with external displays attached <body> I have a mid-2012 Retina Mac Book Pro 15-inch and recently (in the last 3 months) every time I connect an external display (mostly using an old iMac in target display mode but sometimes other stand-alone monitors) I run into performance issues where my dock freezes. This means the dock won't appear from being hidden, alt-tab won't work and I can't run any new apps without using spotlight search and running them from there. (It appears the whole package freezes - mission control, alt-tab, dock hide / un-hide etc.)  I cannot work out the steps to reproduce this, beyond attaching an external monitor (sometimes it happens after I minimize an app, or sometimes it happens during normal work - e.g. I'm working, think I need to use something in the dock, and it's just not responding).  The hanging dock seems to occur frequently. Perhaps once in every 3-5 minutes.  This is starting to affect my productivity as I'm getting more concerned about this and trying to fix it than I am just working around it.  I've tried: - Resetting PRAM - Resetting the SMC - Uninstalling a dock window manager I use called 'hyperdock' - checking activity monitor for processes causing issues (kernel_task &amp;&amp; WindowServer &amp;&amp; cfpredsd seem to be processes taking up processor power and time)  I might add that I used external monitors without issue for a long time. It's only in the last 3 months this has started happening. I don't really want to re-install OSX, but it's starting to look like I might need to...  My question is two-fold: 1. Is there a paper trail I can follow (i.e. in system logs) and someone who can help me find and understand the system logs to really diagnose this 2. Has anyone experience and solved something similar?  Can anyone help?  System: Retina Macbook Pro 15-inch mid-2012 OSX El Capitan latest updates (I always keep it updated)
