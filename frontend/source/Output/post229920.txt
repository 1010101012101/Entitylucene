JSON viewer for OS X <body> I am looking for a JSON viewer for OS X that can:  ul liopen decently large files (e.g.  10 MB), unlike the JSON Editor Eclipse Plugin  (take over 1 minute to generate the treeview for a 500 KB JSON file) and Json Tools Eclipse Plugin (no outline generated if file is more than a few MBs but otherwise great and fast)/li lihas a decently responsive UI, unlike JSON Viewer for Windows/li lican collapse/expand a given level (treeview / outline)/li liworks off-line/li /ul  Ideally:  ul litabs/li ligratis/li lican edit JSON data/li lidisplays the filename somewhere, unlike JSON Viewer for Windows/li liprovide some statistics on the JSON content/li /ul  <answer229978> Checkout Jason, although it appears to be no longer maintained since Osx 10.7, I just opened a JSON in it with Osx 10.11 and it works ok.   strongPlease Note:/strong since it is no longer maintained it is likely going to be unreliable.   Alternatively, I have opted for an online browser-based JSON editor:  ul lihttp://jsoneditoronline.org//li /ul  It is surprisingly fast, allowing you to browse the tree, search values, edit values, insert values, reorder values, even duplicate values. You can even drag and drop stuff around to really get creative :) Unfortunately, you can't see the filename of the json you are editing, but you can open up new browser tabs for multiple json file editing at once.  <answer280978> JSONMate seems to be a usable open-source project with an online editor which probably won't be able to handle large files, but you can fork it on github, adapt to your needs and run it locally.  Intellij Idea and derivatives have decent JSON support but large files take time to load.  SublimeText is also usable for JSON if you install the plugins for beautifying and extra features.  For windows XMLMarker does a good job as an XML and JSON visualizer, but the last version which added JSON support is a limited trial.  <answer282003> I think easiest one is http://jsontuneup.com it also able to validate JSON and show as a tree object on the side.  <comment280636> Was just looking for the same thing. Best I've seen is https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/visual-json/id488709442?mt=12 but no editing data <comment355022> Welcome to Ask Different!
