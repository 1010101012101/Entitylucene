SSD slowdown 85mbit writes, late 2013 Mac Air <body> Hi what could slow down my massively fast solid state disks?  I have from the start of owning it only had 10-15GB free on the 128GB internal drive but now writes are down from their 300+ mbit to 85 mbit very consistently with no spikes ever, Reads are down to 300mbit from 700+ mbit.  Has been heavily used so may I have just written of so many blocks that the system needs to shuffle through and find a good bit of flash each time it wants to use the disk?  <comment291219> SSDs like about 20% free space to operate optimally. <comment291228> perform backup. <comment291232> Yes a backup might be needed.. I use Backblaze but would be good to have my stuff local.. The SSD has always since new had 90% of its space used was performing to full specs at that time.
