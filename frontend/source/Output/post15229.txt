Get default ruby back <body> I'm in the process of setting up my Ruby on Rails development environment and part of that was playing around with RVM. I screwed up a bit though because I deleted the /usr/local/bin/ruby which was required for homebrew.   How can I get that version of ruby back at this point?  <answer15233> See https://superuser.com/questions/171433/is-it-possible-to-reinstall-fix-mac-os-xs-system-ruby-without-doing-a-complete-o  <comment16480> I think you might be confused. There is no standard ruby in `/usr/local/bin/` do you mean `/usr/bin/` ? <comment16483> You're right. I meant /usr/bin
