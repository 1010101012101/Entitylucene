Close all applications in Mountain Lion <body> Is there any hotkey, AppleScript or separate application for that? I don't really like kill 20 applications manually every time I make reboot.  <answer84471> The Finder should safely quit any open apps whenever you logout or reboot. If there is a document with unsaved changes It will prompt you to save or discard the changes before quitting. The keyboard shortcut is kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdQ/kbd.  If you do not want all the apps restarting when you log back in, uncheck the "Reopen windows when logging back in" checkbox in the logout dialog.  <answer84483> You can often just hold ⌘Q, or uncheck "Reopen windows when logging back in" in the ⇧⌘Q dialog. Anyway, here is a shell script that quits applications shown in the Dock in parallel:  precodeIFS=$'\n' for a in $(osascript -e 'set text item delimiters to linefeed tell app "System Events" to name of processes where background only is false result as text'); do osascript -e 'on run {x} quit app x end' -- "$a" &amp; done /code/pre  You can assign it a shortcut with an application like Alfred or FastScripts.  <comment97293> Do you have to kill the applications before or after reboot?
