Why does Apple insisted on creating a new @icloud email address <body> I wanted to sync my MacBook (OS X 10.9) Notes with my iPad (iOS 7). This insisted on creating a new @icloud email address.  Why? I don't want or need yet another email address. What is Apple doing with this?  PS Actually I don't REALLY want to synchronise Notes. What I really wanted to do was transfer a text file so I can copy to Codebook. There seems to be no other way of doing this, except by email, which I didn't want to do. I immediately deleted the Note after transfer.  <answer123769> One of the services included when you sign up for iCloud is an email account. If you don't want it, don't use it.  <answer128936> use simplenote.com or notational velocity they're great for this   <comment144585> I doubt any answers here will satisfy your complaint of this issue.  I would instead recommend that you give Apple feedback directly on this.  If they receive enough similar feedback then they will likely change it in future revisions. - http://www.apple.com/feedback/icloud.html <comment150969> Which problem do you want to solve here: "Why do I need an iCloud account", "How to sync text snippets/notes between OS X and iOS" or something else? Please edit your question to focus on the issue you want to solve.
