In this case the answer is no this is not possible, however you can share via Wi-Fi.  You can share (tether) your iPhone, or Cellular iPad's data connections to your computer via Bluetooth, USB or Wi-Fi but not the reverse.   This article on Apple.com explains the later option  <answer266859> To share the WIFI internet connection on one MacBook to another MacBook (iOS devices will be similar) via bluetooth:  strongOn laptop WITH WIFI internet connectivity:/strong  ol liPreferences  Sharing  Internet Sharing  ul liSelect: "Internet Sharing"/li liSelect: "Share your connection from WIFI"/li liCheck: "To computers using Bluetooth PAN"/li liDe-select Bluetooth Sharing (I am uncertain if this is necessary)/li liCheck: Internet Sharing (and accept the dialog that opens)/li /ul/li liPreferences  Network  WIFI  ul liClick: "Advanced..."/li liClick: "TCP/IP"/li liScreenshot the IPv4 address, subnet mask and router (CMD+SHIFT+4, drag selection to capture)/li liClick: "DNS"/li liScreenshot the DNS Server(s) and Search Domain(s)/li /ul/li liPreferences  Network  Bluetooth PAN  ul liClick: "Advanced"/li liSelect: "Configure IPv4 manually"/li liInput: IPv4 address, subnet mask and router per the screenshot taken above/li liSelect: "Configure IPv6 Automatically"/li liClick: DNS tab/li liInput: DNS Servers and Search Domains per screenshot taken above/li liClick: OK/li /ul/li /ol  strongOn laptop WITHOUT WIFI internet connectivity:/strong  ol liTurn WIFI off/li liPair bluetooth with the other laptop/li liPreferences  Network  Bluetooth PAN  ul liSelect: "Device "/li liClick: Connect/li liClick: "Advanced..."/li liSelect: Configure IPv4 Using DHCP/li liSelect: Configure IPv6 Automatically/li liClick: DNS tab/li liEnter: DNS Servers: PAN network IP of the other laptop (probably 192.168.2.1)/li liEnter: Search domains copied from the screenshot taken on other laptop (unsure if this is necessary)/li liClick: OK/li /ul/li /ol  That should work. Complicated I know.  <comment233027> You can share an Ethernet Internet connection on a Mac via Wi-Fi to any iOS device <comment233049> what are you saying? sure you can share your internet connection. I want to share the connection of my computer (getting internet from wifi) to my iphone (via bluetooth). <comment233094> Sorry @JaimeSantaCruz you are correct, but not bluetooth, that answer wasn't great, I've modified it. <comment233095> @Danny182 If I am wrong then I take it back, but I am pretty sure you can't share your internet from your computer via bluetooth to the phone... Sure the other way is fine, but not from the computer via bluetooth to the phone. <comment345288> @unknowndomain: You are implying that the checkbox for Bluetooth sharing has never done anything and Apple has not bothered to fix it?
