Apple Music listening history <body> Is there a way find a history of listened to music through Apple Music. The way I'm using it right now is:  ol liSearch for a given album/artist on the search bar on iTunes/li liThe "New" tab is selected? (I can't understand why, most of the music I'm searching for were released decades ago)/li liI click on the big play button on the top - albums starts playing/li liI continue searching for more music, seeing related artists, etc/li /ol  If I ever want to go back to the album view, I need to keep pressing the 'Back' button until the album appears. If I ever quit iTunes, I probably won't be able to find the album, unless I added it to my library.  I might just go back using last.fm.  <answer194867> Is there a bar on the bottom of the screen showing which song is currently playing?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o8qah.png" alt="iOS 8.4 mini player"  If so you can try dragging that up and it should bring you to a screen that has more stuff on it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pi8SE.png" alt="iOS 8.4 full player"  Click on the button that looks like three dots with horizontal lines to the right of them (it's to the right of the skip/fast forward button);   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uQks5.png" alt="Up Next button"  that will show "Up Next" if you scroll up you will see your History.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShrL5.png" alt="Up Next scrolling up shows History"  <answer201993> Its available to me off the menu in the header.  click the menu icon, then click the clock icon in the pop-up. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bclMj.jpg" alt="Previously Played Popup"  <comment232585> To do the same on iTunes there is a clock icon on the numbered list button on the top bar. I fail so bad trying to figure what all those icons without alt texts do. <comment318252> This does not go far back too long.
