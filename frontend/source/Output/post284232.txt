Windows compatible USB > LAN adapter compatible? <body> Does anyone have any experience if these cheap USB 2  Ethernet adapters like sold on ebay for 1 or $2 work with mac. They say only windows compatible, but I can't imagine why they wouldn't work on mac too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cYJZ4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer284233> To answer my own question: Googling for the model of the device and mac "KY-RD9700 mac" brings up a list of solutions which involve setting codecsrutil disable/code in safe mode. So they should work.  <comment358443> You might have to contact the seller to see if it is compatible (or someone that have the same model adapter). If you already have the adapter, you can plug it in and check. <comment358452> Asking if "cheap USB to Ethernet adapters are compatible with Mac" is way too much of a broad question.  Please consider narrowing it down to a specific device. <comment358453> Disabling SIP to get a USB device to work should be a **huge** red flag that this is not a reliable/safe product to use.  You are essentially turning of a critical security component to make a peripheral device work. <comment358457> I agree with @Allan. Turning off the System Integrity Protection configuration just to use an ethernet adapter is a very unsatisfying answer to me as it is too dangerous.
