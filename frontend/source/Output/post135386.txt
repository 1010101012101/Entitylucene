Segmentation fault: 11 error ( OpenCV ) <body> I've installed OpenCV, numpy and all other required contents using codebrew install opencv/code.  Then I tried running it codepython &gt;&gt; import cv/code or codepython &gt;&gt; import cv2/code but I get a "Segmentation fault: 11" error. Crash Log  <answer274055> Maybe duplicate of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28669587/python-segmentation-fault-11-when-running-import-cv-or-import-cv2.  Did you install python through brew? If yes then there is probably crash between built-in version that ships with macOS and that installed through brew. Try using absolute path code/usr/bin/python -c "import cv2"/code (built-in) and code/usr/local/bin/python -c "import cv"/code (from brew). One should probably work.  <comment160717> Segmentation fault means that you're accessing some memory location that you're not supposed to, that that location is reserved for someone else. I don't know about OpenCV but are you sure isn't there some other intermediary step(s).
