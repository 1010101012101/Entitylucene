Force a 5 GHz connection on an iPhone 5s <body> My wife and I both have 5s and both connect to BT Home Hub on default settings. Through the hub I can see she is connected using 5 GHz but I am connected using 2.4 GHz. How can I make mine use 5 GHz, at least as a preference?  <answer177668> iOS decides automatically whether 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz connection is best if an access point supports both.  You can change your BT Home Hub settings to broadcast two separate access points. Open the hub settings → Advanced Settings → Wireless → 5 GHz Wireless and disable “Sync with 2.4 GHz”.              img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wwdyg.png" width="561"  This allows you to specifically connect to two separate access points depending on whether you wish to connect over 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz.
