Pay for Apple Developer Program from account money <body> I'm member of the iOS developer program. During this month it will expire. I have about $200 on account. Is it possible to pay from this money without cashing out for the developer program?  <answer224751> Developer account credit, Apple ID account money or any local way to add money to those accounts (like Paypal etc) are invalid for the Developer Program.  The one and only way to pay is by credit card.
