Mousekeys with External Keyboard <body> I'm on a Macbook Pro with OS X 10.9.3.  Mousekeys works fine on the builtin keyboard but seems to have no effect on an external keyboard. How can I change this behavior?  The external keyboard has no numpad.  <answer133108> Thanks 13ruce1337, KeyRemap4MacBook did the job and I get to use hjkl!  The description of cmd + S + D and then holding S + D sounds very awkward in words but in practice it feels reasonable if you just want to click a single item. "High Speed Mode" is a nice convenience.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9tYw.png" alt="KeyRemap4MacBook"  <comment157689> Did you try the numeric keypad on the external keyboard? <comment157690> I forgot to mention that the external keypad has no numpad. <comment157692> Thats pretty important. If thats the case, if there is no function button to supplement a numeric keypad then 8,I,U,O may not work... <comment157693> I don't think you are able to do this without a numeric keypad mapped on your keyboard. The only way to override this is to remap those shortcuts. This may be useful to you: http://superuser.com/questions/359570/how-to-map-keyboard-to-mouse-buttons-in-os-x
