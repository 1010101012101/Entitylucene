OSX Lion freeze after sleep <body> Sometimes, after I wake up my MBP from sleep I get the screen shown in picture. Once I click somewhere in the middle of the screen I get the log in window. When I log in all the windows/apps that were open before sleep are closed. This doesn't happen always but it happens quite often. Any suggestions? Has anyone had same problem ? This started happening after installing SSD. (Crucial M4)img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0h7gF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer54624> I've experienced this as well. The error is actually related to the settings of strongdiplay sleep/strong and strongcomputer sleep/strong:     In strongSystem Preferences  Energy Saver/strong the timers for emdisplay sleep/em and emcomputer sleep/em must be emgreater/em than the emtime of auto logout after inactivity/em in strongSystem Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy/strong.   <answer74023> Before I saw this answer, I turned off automatic logout and haven't seen the problem since.  <comment62558> My colleague sees the same behavior returning from sleep on his MB Air. It's not intermittent behaviour though. Happens always when returning from sleep. <comment62689> It looks like the issue is fixed. Although I think apple should do something about this. Thanks! <comment62690> @IanC. the solution suggested bellow seems to work.
