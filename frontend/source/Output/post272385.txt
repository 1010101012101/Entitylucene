How to dim screen on Mac before going to sleep <body> I would like my MacBook (on El Capitan) to dim the screen before going to sleep, so that I can hit a key to keep it unlocked if desired. Currently, there is no way to keep it from locking if it's started to turn off the screen.  Any thoughts?  <answer272390> There's a free app called Caffeine which prevents it from going to sleep at all.  You can activate it indefinitely, or for a particular period of time.  I use it all the time.  http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/  <answer272412>    …so that I can hit a key to keep it unlocked if desired. Currently, there is no way to keep it from locking if it's started to turn off the screen.   It sounds like you don't need the old dimming action so much as you need a delay on the password lock following sleep or screensaver.   Open "System Preferences → Security &amp; Privacy → General", and change the "Require password … after sleep or screen saver begins" dropdown from "immediately" to "5 seconds" or "1 minute" or longer even.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0CqJ.png" alt="Screenshot"  <comment342342> you could use a hot corner to keep it from going to sleep...? <comment342343> That might work, but I'd still like it to lock itself, in case I walk away from the computer without locking it. <comment342344> offset the screen saver and sleep... ? <comment342346> Unfortunately, my company IT has forced the 'Require password after sleep or screen saver begins' setting to be checked, and I can't change it. Even if I could, it looks like it combines the sleep and screen saver settings into one, so that I couldn't have it ask for password after sleep, but not after screen saver. <comment342348> buy your company IT department doughnuts, then ask for favors... ? <comment342351> I don't want to totally disable it from going to sleep. I still want it to lock/sleep after a certain period of time, but have a 'warning' of sorts, which would allow me to press a key or move the mouse to keep it awake for longer. <comment342352> My MacBook dims the screen before sleep exactly like you suggest. I had no idea it was possible to remove that feature, let alone to turn the feature *on*. I have the ‘Require password after sleep’ setting on too. Interesting question! <comment342354> @grgarside I thought I had seen that on some Macbooks! Good to know that's true. I'm really hoping it's a simple setting that can be changed somewhere. <comment342360> There used to be a checkbox in energy saver that said "Automatically dim display before sleep" but it doesn't seem to be there anymore. <comment342362> Anyone know how to reproduce that "Automaticlally dim display before sleep" in the Automator? I don't have any experience with Apple scripting. <comment342373> I've found the same question as this asked previously, no answer though: [How to change “Automatically reduce brightness before the display goes to sleep” in Yosemite?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/191178/37797) <comment342390> That's exactly what I'm trying to get! Unfortunately, that option is locked by my company's IT. I'll see if I can talk to someone about getting that changed.
