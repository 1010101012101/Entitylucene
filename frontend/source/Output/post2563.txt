Unhide dock when key pressed <body> I am currently hiding my dock. I would like to unhide it whenever a the codefn/code key is pressed. Is this possible?  <answer2564> You can assign that fn to show/hide dock in Keyboard shortcuts, but you will override the original codefn/code key.  Or you can create a strongService in Automator/strong that act upon a keystroke  use this action pack to act upon key and do what you want building up your workflow.  <answer2565> The kbdfn/kbd key is a modifier key that lets you use a software function key F1-F19 when held down, instead of the built-in hardware F key functions (brightness, volume, etc.)  So it's not possible to use that particular key on its own as a keyboard shortcut, just as it's not possible to use the kbdshift/kbd key on its own.  The best you can do is set the shortcut to kbdF13/kbd using System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard shortcuts, which on my particular keyboard is just above the kbdfn/kbd keyâ€¦  <comment2265> That's not going to work with the `fn` key. <comment2266> nop, but you can assign other that does everything <comment2287> That action pack allows you to type a keystroke, not use a keystroke to activate an automator action
