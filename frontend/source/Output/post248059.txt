Where would the code for colours of an OS X app be? <body> I have a to-do app and there is a frustrating black Undo/Hide box that appears and stays there for 10 seconds, every single time you edit an item, or simply move one. In other words, it is there half of the time.  I simply want to change the hex colour code of this box. Could someone please direct me to approximately where this would be?  <comment306153> Is this an app you're making, or using? <comment306221> Using. I just read the TOS of the application and there is no mention at all of not being allowed to modify the software installed on a computer or phone. <comment306222> If the app maker doesn't have a settings field to change the color of the box or turn it on/off, your best bet is to contact the developer and ask him or her to change the box. Unless you have access to the code, in which case I would be able to help. <comment306273> Can't you edit the code of the files of the application. This isn't really possible for iOS apps, but it should be relatively simple for OS X applications, no? <comment308217> Sorry for not responding, but I really don't think you can just straight-up edit the code for OS X applications. I'll do some more research, but I think your best bet is to contact the developer of the app. (EDIT: also try looking for the app on GitHub by doing a search there for the app name; if the code is there I'll help you change it!) <comment308218> Also, what app specifically are you talking about? <comment308273> Hmm, I thought since all the files are on the computer, there would be a way to edit the code. I thought something in line with a CSS file for a website. :) I don't know if the developers would want me messing around with their code. I also want to make suggestions for it and asking would maybe give a bad impression. <comment308274> Oh! The developers released their API and even officially have it on GitHub. https://github.com/Doist/todoist-api <comment308282> You can't just edit the code (it's all hidden because it's proprietary stuff). Unlike HTML/CSS/Javascript of a website. If you think Todoist has a bug/visual error on your machine, you should definitely [report it to the developers](https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), including a screenshot. Not a bad impression! And their API on Github doesn't really help (it's not the code of the Mac app, and so won't help you unless you want to remake Todoist from the ground-up). In the meantime you could use the [Todoist web version](https://todoist.com/web). <comment308360> Okay then. Thank you for the help.
