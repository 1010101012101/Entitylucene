Lost screen on Panasonic 55 inch with Mac mini <body> I tried to set the screen from the Panasonic to best fit. When I did that on my Mac mini the screen went to snow. I tried to get it back by on losing the HDMI cable power of the Mac. Nothing helps. When I start up the Mac the screen is going to snow. It works well on 720p and 1080i but can't go back there.  <answer171553> Try resetting your NVRAM (formerly PRAM).  strongResetting NVRAM/strong  ol liShut down your Mac. /li liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. /li liTurn on your Mac. /li liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound.
