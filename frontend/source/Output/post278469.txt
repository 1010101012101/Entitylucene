Pass a variable (folder pathway) to AppleScript in Automator <body> I am trying to pass a variable that has been set in Automator to an AppleScript within Automator. My Automator workflow is as follows:  Ask for Finder Items (only allowing folder type)  Set Value of Variable (variable set to "chosenfolder")  Get Value of Variable (chosenfolder)  Run AppleScript  precodeproperty odd : true -- set to false to get odd numbers  on run {input, parameters}  set thefolder to (input as text)  set TheNumber to (odd as integer) tell application "Finder"     set FileList to every file of thefolder     repeat with oneFile in FileList         set Ex to name extension of oneFile         set NameString to text -4 thru -1 of ("000" &amp; TheNumber) &amp; "." &amp; Ex         set name of oneFile to NameString         set TheNumber to TheNumber + 2     end repeat end tell  return input end run /code/pre  This returns the error:  precodeCan’t get every file of "Macintosh SSD:Users:etc.... /code/pre  Does anyone have any suggestions as to why the chosen folder in automator cannot be accepted in the AppleScript?  Note: I understand that I can just use "choose folder" in the AppleScript instead of using the Automator workflow items, but I truncated my actual workflow just to show this portion. The variable is needed elsewhere in the Automator workflow in addition to passing it to the AppleScript.  <answer278497> When using codeon run {input, parameters}/code, codeinput/code is a emlist/em, and as such you need to change the following line of your emcode/em:  precodeset thefolder to (input as text) /code/pre  To:  precodeset thefolder to (item 1 of input) /code/pre  That will fix the codeCan’t get every file of .../code error.  Also, while you didn't state the complete settings of the strongGet Value of Variable/strong emaction/em, I'll assume that under strongOptions/strong, you have checked the strong[√] Ignore this action's input/strong checkbox to unlink it from the preceding strongSet Value of Variable/strong emaction/em. Otherwise, it passes the emvariable/em twice to the strongRun AppleScript/strong emaction/em! That is, in this example emworkflow/em you've presented.  <comment350719> That did it - Thanks for the help! <comment369676> Would your answ r work here, too? https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/146988/applescript-automator-pass-variables-between-them?noredirect=1&lq=1 <comment369678> @bmike, Without testing, I can't say as I've not had to need to run AppleScript and or Automator on a remote machine, and I cannot test it until tomorrow. That thread is going on 3 years old, so I think it's safe to wait till tomorrow to find out.
