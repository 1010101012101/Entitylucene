Is there any way to get keychain to revert to a previous password? <body> While creating an account on my new college's website I decided to use the suggested password from Safari. Shortly after I decided this was a silly idea and I needed a password I could remember as I will be logging in from other computers from time to time. During the password change process I managed to get Safari to save the new password in keychain but not actually update the account that I was trying to log in to.  So now Safari will only suggest the new password when I need the old, auto-suggested one and resetting the password involves having to call the college. Is there any way to get keychain to revert to the previous password and save me from having to talk to another human being in real life?
