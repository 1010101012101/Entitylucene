Strange issues with garage band 10 and sound fonts sf2 <body> I'm having issues with Garage Band 10, when trying to set up custom sound fonts.br I installed them in code/Library/Audio/Sounds/Banks/code  Then I opened the MIDI file, doing these steps:  ul liI select my track/li liI choose Smart Control/li liI select DLS Music Device like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCmIn.jpg" alt="DLS Music Device"/li liThen it seems to work. I can see all my banks: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PxyHL.jpg" alt="Banks working"/li liBut when I select the second track, doing exactly the same steps, I see another interface for DLS Music Device. With this one I can't select sound founts. Here's a screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U1Gv5.jpg" alt="DLS Music Device"/li /ul  I can't understand the difference between the first and the second track.  What is causing this? How can I open the right interface I need?  <answer212338> Have the same problem, strange, but works once in a time (don't know the reason) : try it again after having created a different track without DLS
