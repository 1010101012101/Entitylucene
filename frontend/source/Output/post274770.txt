Error -36 "some data can't be read or written" when copying files from SD card <body> I want to copy files from my SD card to my Desktop but for some of the files I get:     The Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in “GOPR0054.MP4” can’t be read or written. (Error code -36)   I tried to use dot_clean because it seems to have done the trick for others:  precodedot_clean Path/To/Directory /code/pre  Didn't work.  I have no idea what error -36 is or how it can be solved. My SD card is in ExFAT format (if that matters).  I'm running macOS Sierra 10.12.2.  <answer282607> Not true; it's a privacy issue with the xfat format. You can copy the files via terminal: codemv/code plus space, drag the file, plus drag the destiny. If that doesn't work, you'll have to change the format of the file.  <comment345556> Error 36 is now and has, for a *long* time been an Apple file system error that boils down to "file is damaged" and/or "premature end of file" Its possible that a file recovery program or service could recover the file or its remains. Otherwise I would reformat the card and then do a whole lot of writing and reading to/from the card to make sure its not a bad card. <comment345564> Ok, thanks, I'll try that. <comment345567> @SteveChambers is correct on all three counts: (1) Error -36 is an **input/output (I/O) error** and this often means the file wasn't _completed_ correctly for the particular file format, or that it's corrupted for some reason. (2) You're best bet is to use data recovery software (there are many) or a file extractor (such as [File Juicer](http://echoone.com/filejuicer/) to see what can be recovered. (3) Reformat the card and _really_ test it before using it for anything critical. There may be nothing wrong with it (the GoPro battery may have died while saving, etc), but you'd want to be sure. <comment345568> Oh, and just to be clear, I have no affiliation with File Juicer whatsoever!
