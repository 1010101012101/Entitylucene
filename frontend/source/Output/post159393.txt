Code editor with key authentication <body> I have been using Dreamweaver for many years simply because it has a built in FTP manager. This makes working on a website very efficient.  The code editor isn't all that great but I manage with it ok.  However I now have a problem in that Dreamweaver does not support key authentication on any of it's versions.  I am having to access a website that will only allow access using a key, passwords are off limits.  I have had a look around and there doesn't seem to be a solution.  <answer159399> You haven't really asked a direct question here; But I assume you're asking for a code editor which supports SFTP key auth?  In which case, Coda 2 has built in support for each type of connection (including key authentication).  If you're after a free alternative, I'd use Cyberduck and Sublime Text. If you open a file from Cyberduck (into Sublime Text), it automatically uploads each time you save.  If on the other hand you're looking for a way to use key authentication within Dreamweaver and the software simply doesn't support it, there's no way solve that.  <comment187374> Additionally, there is package in Sublime Text called [Sublime SFTP](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp) that support key authentication. The package cost $20, but you can use the free trial forever, it only shows a reminder to buy from time to time.
