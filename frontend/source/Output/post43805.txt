Show Active Connections to "Internet Sharing" <body> How can I view a list of devices that are connected to my Apple laptop via Internet Sharing (when it's enabled)? If a list doesn't exist, does Internet Sharing log DHCP requests and if so, where? Thanks.  <answer43828> You can try codearp/code on the command-line:     strongNAME/strong      strongarp/strong -- address resolution display and control      DESCRIPTION      The strongarp/strong utility displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address translation tables used by the address resolution protocol (arp(4)).  With no flags, the program displays the current ARP entry for hostname.  The host may be specified by name or by number, using Internet dot notation.   E.g. for internet-sharing from Ethernet to Airport I use:  h1codearp -i en1 -a/code/h1  This will list all clients connected via WLAN.  <answer49953> codeInternetSharing/code does log which address gets a DHCP lease within:  precode/var/log/system.log /code/pre  Technically it is the codebootpd/code daemon which does take care of this part of the network access.  You can track who is getting access to your network now with this command:  precodetail -f /var/log/system.log | grep 'bootpd.*\[en.\]' /code/pre  and for Mavericks, Yosemite &amp; El Capitan:  precodetail -f /var/log/system.log | grep 'bootpd.*\[bridge.\]' /code/pre  You can display who connected and when to your network with this command:  precodegrep 'bootpd.*\[en.\]' /var/log/system.log /code/pre  and for Mavericks, Yosemite &amp; El Capitan:  precodegrep 'bootpd.*\[bridge.\]' /var/log/system.log /code/pre  If you need to track it further in the past, the command is:  precodebzgrep 'bootpd.*\[en.\]' `ls -tr /var/log/system.log.*.bz2` /code/pre  and for Mavericks, Yosemite &amp; El Capitan:  precodebzgrep 'bootpd.*\[bridge.\]' `ls -tr /var/log/system.log.*.bz2` /code/pre  Finally if you'd like to immediately distinguish in these logfiles known devices from uninvited ones, the method is to fill the configuration file of codebootpd/code which is:  precode/etc/bootptab /code/pre  with all known MAC addresses.  <comment49784> Good question!! <comment89116> Just a tip: if you're unsure which interface is being used, you can always type `ifconfig` to list all of them. My MBP is connected to the internet via wifi, and I'm sharing internet to a raspberry pi over an ethernet cable. I had to use `-i bridge0` to see the device's IP address. <comment113526> `arp` command will give you a snapshot of a state which might be rapidly changing, most notably if you are looking to a Wi-Fi network where devices may intermittently connect because they are on the border of the wireless sphere of access. <comment147242> As of (at least) Mavericks, bootpd logs connections to a bridge rather than to the physical network device, so you'll want to grep for 'boodpf.*\[bridge.*\]' in order to find connection attempts. arp will still list connections to e.g. '-i en1', as well as to e.g. '-i bridge100'. <comment173558> I think a useful place to start here might be a bare `arp -a`. You probably don't have that many interfaces that are translated! <comment264889> @smessing this is exactly what I'm doing - thanks!
