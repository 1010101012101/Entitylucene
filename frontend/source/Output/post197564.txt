Boot Camp partition is no longer accessible (El Capitan build 15A225f) <body> I have recently upgraded to the El Capitan Beta, which has caused a conflict with the Windows 8.1 Bootcamp installation on my MBP (see my previous question: Is it possible to Bootcamp Windows 8.1 using USB on Late 2011 MBP?).   At startup, the option to boot from Windows is no longer available, and the partition has become invisible on Disk Utility.  I am running 10.11 build 15A225f  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER     0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0     1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1     2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            250.1 GB   disk0s2     3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3     4:       Microsoft Basic Data                         30.6 GB    disk0s4 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER     0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +249.7 GB   disk1                              Logical Volume on disk0s2                              IDIDIDIDIDID                              Unencrypted /code/pre  <comment240847> Please edit your post to include the build of El Capitan you run with this issue <comment246668> Hi Mike. I've included the build. <comment246669> I wish I had another upvote. What does `diskutil list` show you for the partition status. I'd love to help, but I'm in the dark how to proceed quite yet. <comment246678> There are two disks: /dev/disk0 (internal, physical) and /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual) - the former has a Microsoft Basic Data partition with no name, a size of 30.6GB and identifier of disk0s4. This probably isn't useful, but I'm not sure what info to provide. <comment246679> Sorry, I think I increased the size of the partition, so the second one:    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +249.7 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  ID-HERE-NOT-SURE-IF-SAFE TO-SHARE                                  Unencrypted <comment246681> @Ryan Please add fundamental info like the `diskutil list` output to your question by editing and properly formatting it and not in the comments. You may scramble any UUIDs though. <comment246687> + diskutil list output added to question <comment254185> Still awaiting guidance on this. Have since updated to the public release. <comment289358> @Ryan: [This guide](http://nerdr.com/bootcamp-partition-lost-repairing-mac-partitions/) should help you fix it. <comment289359> @Ryan: Please also see [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/210730/68458) to find out how to turn off SIP protection in El Capitan. You'll need to turn it off to make changes to the Master Boot Record.
