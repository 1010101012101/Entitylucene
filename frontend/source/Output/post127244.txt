Changing iCloud account <body> My old e-mail address was disabled and I need to delete my iCloud account with the old account info, I had updated my Apple ID with my new e-mail address, now I cannot delete the account on my iphone because it is grayed out. I tried changing my apple ID e-mail back to my old account, but since that e-mail has been disabled it cannot send a verification e-mail. What do I try next?  <comment149107> The answer to this question might be useful: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/96988/how-can-i-change-my-icloud-account-on-my-iphone?rq=1
