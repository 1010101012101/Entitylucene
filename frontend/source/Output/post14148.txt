How to connect a Facebook account to Adium? <body> For some reason I can't get Adium to connect to Facebook. Facebook refuses to log me in every time I try.  I have the right email address and the right password... but it keeps asking for password.  <answer14164> Facebook updated its chat system, breaking Adium's support. You can still connect to Facebook but you need to setup the account as a strongJabber account/strong.  Your username will be codeYour_Facebook_Username@chat.facebook.com/code. The server is codechat.facebook.com/code. The port is code5222/code and you should not use SSL.  <answer271597> On April 30th 2015, Facebook disabled Jabber support. There is currently no way to connect to Facebook's chat service from Adium. The developers are aware of the issue, and work is being done in Pidgin (whose protocol library Adium piggy-backs on) to make Facebook chat functional again.  <comment15280> It's also worth linking to the official Facebook Chat page: http://www.facebook.com/sitetour/chat.php <comment15281> SSL is working fine for me. i've enabled "Require ssl" but not "old style ssl".
