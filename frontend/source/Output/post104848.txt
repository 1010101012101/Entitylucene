How to simulate middle-click <body> You can simulate a right mouse-click with the magic mouse if you tap the right half of the mouse without touching the left half and THEN click.  But is it possible to achieve a middle-mouse-click with the magic mouse (on OSX 10.6)?  And How?  <answer104849> With MagigPrefs you can change the setting so the middle area of the mouse does create a middleclick as expected.  <answer104868> h2BetterTouchTool/h2  With BetterTouchTool, you can create a Magic Mouse action to middle-click, such as this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H0qlg.png" alt="Magic Mouse Gesture: Single Finger Middle Click → Predefined Action: Middleclick"  hr  emFor trackpad users/em, BTT gives you the option to perform a 'special' middle click designed for CAD users (accessible through strongAdvanced/strong → strongAction Settings/strong → strongSettings for Predefined Actions/strong → strongUse special middle click mode/strong).     This allows people who work with CAD software etc. to perform a real middleclick using the trackpad. Use predefined action middleclick in combination with "three finger click" gesture. Click with 3 fingers then release two of them and move the remaining finger to drag the view around.   <comment148705> Feel free to edit this if the duplicate question is materially different than what you are trying to accomplish. <comment326210> Thanks for this (3 years later)!!  Just rebuilt my MBP, and couldn't get my middle click to work.  But I don't remember having done this in BTT before I rebuilt, but it's been so long that I must have just forgotten that I ever did it.
