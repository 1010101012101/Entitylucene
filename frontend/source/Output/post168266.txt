How to install yosemite on a new harddrive? <body> So I am going to put a new hard drive on my Macbook Pro. After I install the hard drive how would I go about putting Yosemite on there? I have a pc and a 32gb flash drive. Could I download it through the pc onto the flash and then after I put in the new hard drive could I install from the flashdrive?  <answer168288> Theoretically, you emcould/em but it may or may not work. In my best opinion, I would go to an Apple Store and tell them to boot your computer on their network. They will do it for free, and it is a lot faster than sitting at home waiting for 2 hours while it downloads the OS again.   <answer168304> If you have an external USB enclosure, you could do what I did.  ul liPut the new drive in the enclosure./li liUse Carbon Copy Cloner to clone your internal to the new drive. (Works for everything except Bootcamp partitions, for which you need WinClone)/li liSwap drives./li liDone./li /ul  Not free, but solid.  <comment197596> Thank you I think that is what I shall do.
