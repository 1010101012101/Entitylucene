Can you talk on the iPhone and use Siri with Monster beats headphones? <body> I want a set of Beats by Dre headphones and have seen that they come with a control on the cord. Does this have a Mic? and can it be used with Siri in the same way the official Apple ones can?  I have looked at online reviews etc, but little is mentioned with iPhone voice compatibility.  <answer44553> strongYes./strong  You should be okay. The beats headphones mic is simply an extension of the built-in mic. Additionally, the hardware to filter out background noise is inside of your iPhone and so the mic won't make much of a difference. Can you do same thing with your standard Apple headphones, right? It's the same thing.  I personally use Klipsch ONE headphones with my iPhone 4. It works well with voice commands. I used my Apple earbuds with the new iPad before. Dictation works like a charm. So, yes, you can.    <answer44609> h1Yes./h1  The Monster Beats cables are fully compatible with Apple hardware. They have a mic to support voice actions and Siri. They also have all the hardware buttons for playing music and making phone calls.  I happen to own the Beats Solo headphones.  This is what the strongpackaging/strong says:     "Made for iPod", "Made for iPhone" and "Made for iPad" mean that an   electronic accessory has been strongdesigned to connect specifically/strong to   iPod, iPhone or iPad, respectively, and has been strongcertified by the   developer to meet Apple performance standards/strong.      (also see MiF logo on Apple's website)   These minimum standards would include voice and button actions using the headset.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AdF2f.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q6QaJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
