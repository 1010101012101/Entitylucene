Alternative to "luit" which is available via homebrew <body> I have a few legacy commands which I need to run in the terminal. Unfortunately they only work with ISO-8859-1 encoding being used.   For now I manually switch the terminal encoding, but that bugs me. On Linux I use luit, which can convert the in- and output from utf-8 to iso and vice versa (transparently for the run command).  Is there something similar for OS X, preferably available through homebrew or available as binary?  Greetingsbr -Sascha-  <answer84256> I have codeluit/code on my Mac. It was installed as part of the X11 system from XFree86. I installed it via MacPorts. Perhaps Homebrew has an X11 installer too?  <answer89772> You can install XQuartz as a binary from http://xquartz.macosforge.org. It's the de facto standard X11 for OS X. It comes with codeluit/code and all the normal X11 stuff.   Homebrew does not have an X11 installer; it expects you tu use XQuartz, and will compile against it when it is present.  You could also use AppleScript to programmatically change your Terminal settings instead of doing it manually.
