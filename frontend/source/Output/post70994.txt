Is it possible to add a symbol to the character palette? <body> I guess everybody here knows about the character palette of Mac OS X.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2oq5O.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is it possible to create a new symbol, using an image or a vectorial shape made in Illustrator, and add it to the character palette? If so, a brief outline of how this would work would be ideal since I'd like to actually do this to extend my Mac's usable characters with some custom designs.  <answer71671> The character palette simply gives you access to the characters in the fonts on your system.  To add something to it, you need to create a font with that character in it or add the character to an existing font.  Common font creation tools for OS X are Fontlab and Fontforge.  There are also some online services that may work (use Google to find them).
