Macbook: Unable to unmount volume for repair <body> Yesterday, I restarted my macbook and after that, it just won't startup normally. It just shows the multi-languages restart message, followed by some error message (which displays so fast I can't read it properly). I did catch something like Mac OS version not yet set. I went on google and tried the Disk utility First Aid but it complains that my startup disk cannot be unmounted. I read on some threads to reboot from usb but how to do this? Panicking! Help!!  <comment362817> Similar case happened to me few week ago. I had to format the HD and restore from backup. How old is your laptop ? <comment362832> Around 2.5 years old <comment362915> there is a Mac utility Mountain that lets you mount and unmount volumes. Maybe that could unmount your drive for you.
