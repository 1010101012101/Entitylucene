Strange consequence of drag-and-dropping a file from a different directory than the one I am in in a column view window <body> Here is the situation. I am in directory X. I have a file in X selected. Then I scroll a couple columns back, and take a file in a directory a few steps up in the "family tree" (parent, "grandparent", or "great-grandparent" directory), to drag-and-drop it (typically copying it) into another directory. After such an action, I am left like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0bbpj.png" alt="enter image description here"  As seen in the image, the drag-and-dropped file (code.tex/code) is pseudo-selected, and looks gray, the directory (in this case, grandparent of the file I have actually selected, which is the code.m4a/code) looks like we are not examining its contents, but still we can see its contents. In short, it looks like the drag-and-dropped file is a folder, containing what should be the contents of a directory -- in this case, codenot_online/code. Why does this happen? Why is the drag-and-dropped file pseudo-selected in the first place? And why is it not selected, with the result that we no longer see the contents of codenot_online/code?  strongMore info/strong  I just tried it with a different file and with a preview open, and it didn't happen, so either it is erratic (varying from time to time and from drag-and-dropped file to d&amp;d'ed file), or preview turns it off.  strongYet more info/strong  It seems it emdoes/em show erratic behaviour, and is somehow triggered by holding the option key while clicking the file. That is, if I just take the file without holding codeAlt/code, it doesn't happen, whereas if I click while holding codeAlt/code, it sometimes happens.  <comment308461> Are you trying to drag and drop two files, one each from different folders in Column view? If yes, you should be doing it from List view in order to just act on the selected files themselves. <comment308462> @user3439894 No, I am drag-and-dropping a file from one directory whilst I have a file from another directory (a subdirectory, to be more precise) already selected. I was just wondering why this strange thing happens. <comment308464> If you're only trying to move one file then only select one file. <comment308466> @user3439894 I bet this happens even if I don't select any file in `registr` but still d&d a file from the directory of that `.tex` while the directory I am looking at is `registr`.
