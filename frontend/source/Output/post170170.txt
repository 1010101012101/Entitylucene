Automount afp Volume with AppleScript <body> I know this is similar to other open questions about mounting network drives, but this one is slightly different.   I have an AppleScript that runs at startup that looks like this:  precodetell Application "Finder"   mount volume "afp://192.168.1.105/file_server/user_name end tell /code/pre  Where codeuser_name/code is specific to the sub folder under codefile_server/code. On one of my Macs, this works and mounts the sub-folder at codeuser-name/code. On a different mac, it only mounts the codefile_server/code folder. The one that doesn't mount the full path is OSX 10.9.5. The one that works properly is OSX 10.10.1. Makes me think it's an OSX version difference.  <comment201863> Assuming that the mount paths are different (in user_name) on both machines, are there any special characters or spaces in the path that fails to work? <comment201865> No there are very simple path names. No spaces, no weird characters. <comment202369> are there user access/permissions differences <comment202628> No, I just verified the permissions. Also, I would think I would get a different error if it was a permissions problem. Currently, the script tries to mount `/file_server/xxx` and I don't get any warning and the `/file_server` fold does mount correctly with the correct permissions. Just not drilled down into `/xxx`
