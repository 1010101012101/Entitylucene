Apache2 no longer working in Yosemite <body> After upgrading OSX to yosemite, my local apache2 server is no longer working.  Running  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  does not give any error, however nothing is running on localhost:80, and nothing is written to the log files in code/var/log/apache2//code either. The log files have not been touched after the upgrade of OSX. However, codesystem.log/code shows:  precodeOct 29 13:27:45 Jeroens-MBP sudo[1210]:   jeroen : TTY=ttys000 ; PWD=/private/var/log/apache2 ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/sbin/apachectl start Oct 29 13:27:45 Jeroens-MBP com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (org.apache.httpd): Please switch away from OnDemand to KeepAlive. Oct 29 13:27:45 Jeroens-MBP com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (org.apache.httpd[1213]): Service exited with abnormal code: 1 /code/pre  In addition, my code/usr/include/code dir seems completely empty after the upgrade, not sure if that is related.    <answer153712> Okay I solved my problem. It seems like the upgrade of apache had disabled codemod_ssl/code. To debug apache2 config files in osx, run codeapachectl/code without any parameters:  precodeJeroens-MBP: jeroen$ sudo apachectl AH00526: Syntax error on line 10 of /private/etc/apache2/other/mobilize.conf: Invalid command 'SSLProxyEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration /code/pre  <comment207147> "To debug apache2 config files in osx, run apachectl without any parameters" - man that saved me hours of work. Why apachectl doesn't spit that diagnostic info when passing the "start" arg I do not know...
