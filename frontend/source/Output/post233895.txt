Completely remove some strange iTunes-purchased songs <body> I do not understand why my iPhone recently gets some strange songs and I would like to delete them, completely.   To remove them, I first locate these songs in my iTunes library. But when I try to delete them, I get this message before continuing:  emcodeThese items will be hidden from your iTunes purchases./code/em  What I am looking for is a way to completely remove those songs. So simply hiding them from itune does not suffice. Any idea how to do that?  <answer233896> Unfortunately their is no such way. For the U2 album Apple emforced/em everyone to buy for free, there is a tool to completely remove it SOI-Removal Tool  The only option for your case would be to contact Apple Support in order for them to completely delete those purchases.  <comment285827> There is no delete - just hide. http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/30351/5472 <comment317839> Ahaha, Tim Cook's infatuation with some pathetic artists forced down everyone's throat seems soooo childish.
