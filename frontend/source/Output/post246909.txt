How do I get my photos/videos off of icloud directly to an external hard drive? <body> I have a MacBook Air and a hard drive that is compatible. I have already moved all photos and videos from my computer storage to my harddrive so no issues there. My problem is that I can't figure out how to get all of my photos/videos from iCloud to my hard drive (there are a little over 6,000) because my computer is still telling me storage is full yet it's not.   This is stopping me from being able to download any of the photos onto my computer and export them that way.
