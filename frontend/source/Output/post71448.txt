Change send mail shortcut to tab + enter in Apple Mail <body> I'm looking for a way to change the default "send" shortcut in mail to "tab + enter" (like gmail)  I've found a way to change it to codecmd + enter/codewith the following:  codedefaults write com.apple.mail NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Send" "@\\U21a9"/code  but doing something like:   codedefaults write com.apple.mail NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Send" "\\u21E5\\U21a9"/code  Does not work.   I've followed this answer, but I am unable to add the tab key in the shortcut dialog, and would prefer to do it from the command line.   Thanks!  <answer71455> Because tab isn't a modifier key (like command, shift, option and control), you can't use it in combination with other non-modifier keys to make a shortcut. It's simply not possible the way the OS X input systems work AFAIK.  You might be able to jury-rig something together using KeyboardMaestro or similar apps that listens for tab-return and then executes the send mail command, but I don't know how well it would work, or how closely it would match your expected behaviour.  <answer71504> You could save this as private.xml in KeyRemap4MacBook.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;private.test&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;only&gt;MAIL&lt;/only&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;--SimultaneousKeyPresses-- KeyCode::TAB, KeyCode::RETURN, KeyCode::D, VK_SHIFT, VK_COMMAND&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <answer278030> precodedefaults write com.apple.mail NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Send" $'@\\U21a9' /code/pre  <comment83022> Alas, I will have to face the pain and just re-learn that shortcut when I am using mail.
