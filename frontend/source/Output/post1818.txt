Is it possible to queue songs on the iPhone? <body> I would like to queue up songs on my iPhone like I can on my desktop music player. Is this possible with iTunes, or is there an alternative music app that will let me do this?  <answer1819> You can create an on the go playlist directly on the iPhone that acts like a queue. Alternatively you could create a playlist in iTunes then import that to the iPhone by dragging the list to the phone icon. Any missing tracks would be imported.  <comment1578> The problem is that I want to queue up songs on the fly. I will check out on the go playlists however <comment1579> @Casebash: This is the only way to do it. <comment1580> This actually works pretty well. Songs added are added to the end and you can easily clear it
