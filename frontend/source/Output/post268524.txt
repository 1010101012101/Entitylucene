Unable to add more than 1 static route <body> I'm trying to add multiple persistent static routes using the networksetup command. I've used this method in the past and am now running into a strange issue, where I only seem to be able to add 1 route. For instance, if I go to add another route the previous route will be overwritten with the new.   I've only recently started using this method of adding routes to OSX. Is this normal behaviour?  Here are the commands I'm using:    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code# networksetup -setadditionalroutes "Ethernet 1" 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 69.69.69.69 /code/pre  Then when I run getadditionalroutes, it will only display the last entered route. For exampleâ€¦  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code# networksetup -getadditionalroutes "Ethernet 1" 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 69.69.69.69 # networksetup -setadditionalroutes "Ethernet 1" 20.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 69.69.69.69 # networksetup -getadditionalroutes "Ethernet 1" 20.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 69.69.69.69 /code/pre  What is the best way for me to achieve my goal?  <answer268544> If you want to set additional routes either add strongall/strong routes:  precodenetworksetup -setadditionalroutes "Ethernet 1" 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 69.69.69.69 20.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 69.69.69.70 /code/pre  or set a variable with the existing additional routes:  precodeADDITIONALROUTES=$(networksetup -getadditionalroutes "Ethernet 1") /code/pre  which yields e.g.  precodeecho $ADDITIONALROUTES 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 69.69.69.69 /code/pre  and then use   precodenetworksetup -setadditionalroutes "Ethernet 1" $ADDITIONALROUTES 20.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 69.69.69.70 /code/pre  to add other routes without loosing the old routes.  <comment337175> First, what version of OSX are you using? Second would you accept other methods/tools to add your route besides networksetup? Finally, what does netstat -r output? <comment337188> Aha! Thank you very much, I've done what you suggested in your second line - add all the routes in one command. Cheers
