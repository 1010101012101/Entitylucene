Locked out of my Mac? <body> Recently when I was on my Mac I had turned off Bluetooth accidentally when I had meant to turn the WiFi off and back on (the WiFi was acting up). I logged off when I had to get off. And since my Mac keyboard is the default Bluetooth connected one that you get when you purchase it, it decided to not work.   When I came back later to finish up some things, I turned on my keyboard and typed my password, but nothing showed up in the box. The keyboard, when I turned it on, the light flashed until I finished typing, the  turned off. It didn't type anything into the password box, despite being on.   I replaced the batteries thinking it was dead, but that didn't work either. I have no USB connected keyboard to access my mac, I can't access Bluetooth, and my keyboard wont do jack squat.   I don't know how to log in!   How can I log in when Bluetooth is turned off?  (Also if my explanation doesn't make much sense, I have a video instead. )  <answer296029> You can reconnect your Bluetooth keyboard/mouse by cold starting/rebooting your Mac with the physical power button.  ol liMake sure you keyboard is turned on/li liDisconnect all physical devices from the Mac, including any peripherals (printers, scanners, USB flash, etc)/li liReboot the Mac (or boot the Mac if it was shut down) strongusing the physical hardware button located on the machine/strong /li /ol  This will trigger the Bluetooth setup wizard and detect the Bluetooth devices and enable the service automatically.
