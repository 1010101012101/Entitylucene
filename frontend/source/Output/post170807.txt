VTDecoderXPCService taking CPU <body> Sometimes I notice CPU load for no reason and I see in Activity Monitor that codeVTDecoderXPCService/code is using 15-30% of CPU.  After I restart Safari it is ok for some time until it happens again.  Any ideas? Could be flash related? When this happens there is no videos loaded in tabs but maybe one play triggers the problem.  Should I just uninstall Flash from the system? I'm still on Mavericks and Safari 7 - will youtube play without issues via HTML5? I heard they made it work on Safari 8, not sure about 7.  Thank you  <answer224809> According to this website, the VTDecoderXPCService is called to sandbox applications that might play quicktime or other video content.  ul lihttp://appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/09/apple_deadline_for_sandboxing_in_mac_app_store_arrives_march_1//li /ul  You could try quitting your applications one by one and seeing which ones are calling that process.  For me, it's usually Safari or iTunes and since you have it taking CPU that's pretty measurable, it should be easy to track down what's sending work to that part of the OS.  <answer253773> I tried and in my case is the app Photos, and also there's this photoanalysisd process is running a lot of CPU too. MacOs sierra and 2011 MBP  <answer257073> Quitting iMessage ( Messages ) seems to kill the process.  <answer258982> Don't have a right solution. But I also noticed that Messages.app is the problem here. After I quit the Messages app the process exited. Before that, even after killing it, it'd respawn each time.  <answer259418> I did a spindump via the activity monitor and so i found the resposible app. In my case it was Firefox (HTML5 Vids)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fCmu2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer262429> I had the same problem - VTDecoderXPCService process taking up about 30% of CPU and when I tried to quit it with the Activity Monitor, it just reappeared right away.  I didnt have any video related apps open or tabs in Chrome.   There was a second process called Google Chrome Helper that was also taking up about 25% of the CPU. Weirdly, once I quit that one with the Activity Monitor the VTDecoderXPCService disappeared as well.   <answer262997> My issue was Messages app, but it happened because there was a link to a YouTube video that in my messages. I played back the embedded version, and that's when the CPU usage spiked.  <answer265017> I wrote this guide if you want to limit the CPU usage of the process. It is horribly irritating and I shouldn't have to disable Messages every 15 minutes.  https://blog.geesu.net/2016/12/05/vtdecoderxpcservice-using-100-of-your-cpu-use-cputhrottle/  <answer267587> I saw this behavior after I accessed the People album in Photos on Sierra. I'm sure it's doing face recognition locally, since Apple bragged about it at the Sierra launch event.  Photos has a "pause for one day" button on the iCloud tab in the app preferences. I pressed that button and everything is now back to normal.   <answer270992> Quitting FaceTime closed the service for me.  <answer292901> Mac OS X Sierra 10.12.6 on 4 core, Corei7  Facetime and PhotoBooth both launch the codeVTDecoderXPCService/code process and consumer ~30% CPU time.  <comment200882> it's a video sandboxing service, according to Google - QuickTime, perhaps camera-related <comment200901> ok, thank you... I'll observe if this happens after the camera is in use... also maybe I will disable camera when I'm not using it with iSight Disabler script... for paranoid and performance reasons :) <comment228294> Most likely this process is related video playback. Also, you won't have any performance improvement from unloading a driver of an unused piece of hardware. <comment257724> I'm also investigating this for myself, if you never solved this problem then you may be helped by [this thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3193904?start=30&tstart=0). There's useful discussion in there though I'm unsure whether or not there's consensus on the actual cause. <comment270920> I don't know exactly what it's being used for, but it does appear to be a [legitimate](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemFrameworks/SystemFrameworks.html) part of the operating system. Both `VTDecoderXPCService` and `VTEncoderXPCService` are within `/System/Library/Frameworks/VideoToolbox.framework`. <comment323874> This does not really answer the question.

Running spindump pointed me at the culprit; restarting chrome sorted me out <comment329965> Great answer. It was Slack.app for me. <comment330074> @IconDaemon This does not answer the question in full. But I'm providing a clue. Maybe someone else can elaborate on that. And I don't have a different question. In no way this was a question and it didn't even have a question mark anywhere. <comment362689> For me, it happened when I viewed [this page](https://medium.com/@birowsky/web-is-ready-for-you-on-line-elm-d3aa14dbf95), which has a lot of gifs. So is suppose it's some sort of 'video' handler.
