Windows Remote Desktop from Mac launches Internet Explorer when 1 key is pressed <body> As title above, whenever kbd1/kbd is pressed (right of tilde), Internet Explorer launches when connected to a Windows 7 machine that I accessed remotely.  I'm not sure what this is and what keyword to search for.  Any idea how to solve this?  Windows 7 VM on VirtualBox does not behave like this.  <comment360898> Does this happen on more than one remote connection or only that one particular Win7 machine? <comment360911> I tried from mac and from windows 7, both behaves the same. <comment360913> Ok...so just to clarify.  You connected from a Mac using RDP and from a Windows 7 machine using RDP to the same remote Win7 machine and both did the same thing?  If this is the case, then the problem is on your remote machine, not with the RDP clients
