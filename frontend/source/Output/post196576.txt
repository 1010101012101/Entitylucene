Set the WorkingDirectory to user's home in launchd? <body> I understand that you can change a LaunchAgent's working directory with a codeWorkingDirectory/code key, but is there any way to set the Working Directory to a user's home directory reliably and portably within the plist? Can I do something like:  precode&lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;~&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  and have it work?  <comment234834> Is there some reason that you could not just test this to get the answer? <comment234879> `~` and `$HOME` don't seem to work. <comment234889> Shell expansion only works if you `EnableGlobbing` and only in the keys `Program` and `ProgramArguments` <comment234892> Isn't `EnableGlobbing` [deprecated in Yosemite](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6851122)? <comment235003> @Roger Filmyer- You are still missing my point. launchd isn't a shell. `~` tilde expansion and `$HOME` variable expansion are done by a shell. So, to answer your question, you cannot use either in the key WorkingDirectory nor is there a reliable way to do this within a portable launchd.plist. My suggestion would be to change directories within a shell script. Of course I have no idea what you are trying to achieve. <comment235237> @fd0 That actually answers my question ("no" counts as an answer :p ). I was trying to come up with a way to create a LaunchAgent for a daemon ([zedd](http://zedapp.org/zedd/), if you're curious) that is supposed to be run in a specific directory. I now understand that I'd have to use an absolute path instead.
