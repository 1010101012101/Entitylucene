Is there any way to remove the stock ticker from Notification Center in iOS5? <body> I like Notification Center in iOS5, but I find the stock ticker at the bottom a bit distracting. Is there any way to turn it off?  <answer27470> Go to strongSettings  Notifications  Stock Widget/strong and turn it strongOff/strong.  emNotifications/em for all apps that can display them are managed in emSettings/em. Two built-in apps, Stocks and Weather, get exceptional treatment and show in Notification Center as widgets. In the Notifications Settings, they are listed as emStock Widget/em and the emWeather Widget/em.   To prevent an app from displaying in Notification Center, click the app in the list and make sure the option “Notification Center” is set to off.  <comment31551> Ah! Thank you — I thought I’d looked through Settings but I ignored “Notifications” because it’s in the same place as “Push Notifications” was before, and I always ignored that because I never used them.
