Apple hardware reserve power mode <body> Why does Apple hardware go into reserve power mode 2 seconds before I'm going to use it? It's eerie - this happens to me constantly - I'm about to start typing on my macbook, or look at something on the iPad or iPhone and as I'm turning to reach for it, it goes to sleep.  Like it's watching me.  How does it KNOW?  <answer11821> Typical response 1: There's an App for that.  Typical response 2: It's magical.  <comment12360> +1, have a sense of humor. :) PS: Electric tape over the iSight camera will help.
