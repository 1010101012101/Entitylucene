Sometimes Internet stops working <body> While I'm navigating in the Internet with Google Chrome the Internet stops working, it doesn't load the websites suddenly sometimes. I have an Edimax repeater and when I connect from the modem and repeater to and fro, it begins to load the websites again.  The first thing you could think to do is to call to the Internet support and that's what I did. They said me that it's an iMac problem because it only happens to my computer.     What can I do to fix it?   <comment251493> What have you tried? Some ideas - use Safari to test the specific failing web page. What are you changing on the Mac when you "connect from the modem and repeater to and fro" if anything? It's not clear the problem is on the Mac, but you might need to do some troubleshooting to isolate one failure or narrow the possible failures. <comment251495> @bmike I have in the living room a modem. I have a repeater in my room. I'm usually connected to the repeater, but when the website is loading too much time I connect to the modem. When the website is loading too much time, I connect back to the repeater. It's not a specific webpage, it's with any webpage I am on.
