How do I take a screenshot on the iPad? <body> How do I create an image, containing a copy of the current screen display, on the iPad?  <answer2738> Press both the sleep/wake and the home button simultaneously, and release quickly. The screenshot will be taken (in any app) and saved as an image, available within the Photos app.  <answer192046> Press both the home button and the power button at the same time. This will save the screenshot to Photos. You can then edit the screenshot as you would a normal photo. I've noticed the screenshot comes in handy whenever you want to copy a photo, but are blocked from downloading it. :)  <comment2460> Community wiki? Self answer? <comment2474> that's not even an interesting question. I think it's one of the first things you learn how to do, just like turning the device off. <comment2529> @Martín: I made the question a CW for the very reason that I was about to answer it myself. That's a perfectly acceptable (and encouraged) use case on SE sites (see http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/17463/should-i-ask-a-question-i-know-the-answer-to). Even more so when a site is in its 'gestation' period and useful information can be added. <comment2530> @Victor: It's one I didn't find out about myself for a while (well, a day or two, but it's relative!). Turning the device off is pretty intuitive - like almost everything about using the iPad - but taking a screenshot isn't, IMO. It's something that you would never guess, only stumble across through trial and error, or discover via the web. <comment2536> I wasn’t complaining I was just wondering because you added the question and the answer practically at the same time, which is ok, but was strange. In any case, this information is rather simple to find with a ‘take screenshot ipad’ google query. <comment36707> Unfortunately I've had an iPad for a long time and never learned how to do this, so I'm actually happy the question and answer was posted here. Thanks @BobbyJack <comment36847> No worries, @cwd - glad you appreciated it! I was in the same boat until trawling through Google - maybe people who find this 'intuitive' are experienced with the iPhone and it's the same operation (just guessing). <comment228297> Hi @ThePianoGirl, welcome to Ask Different.
