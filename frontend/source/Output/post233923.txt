Install FreeDOS via Bootcamp <body> Is it possible to run FreeDOS via Bootcamp on a Mac?  If so, what are the instructions for doing so?  <answer233944> There were a few housekeeping chores that I preformed before booting from the FreeDOS DVD. I have both Yosemite and El Capitan installed on my Mac. To avoid SIP problems, I chose to preform the chores while booted to Yosemite. SIP was still enabled, but Yosemite ignores the SIP settings. I assume you can use El Capitan with SIP disabled.  I required the partition, that I chose to install FreeDos, to meet certain requirements.   ol liThe partition must be formatted MS-DOS (FAT) by the Disk Utility application. Note: Later when installing FreeDOS, I reformatted the partition again./li liThe partition must appear in the the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. The contains of the this table can be displayed by using the following command.  precodesudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0 /code/pre  If you are installing on a second internal disk, then replace codedisk0/code with codedisk1/code./li liThe id shown in the MBR table for this partition must be code0C/code. This usually occurs after formatting the partition as MS-DOS (FAT). In my case, I first had to format the partition as "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)", then format as MS-DOS (FAT). This must be a bug in the Disk Utility./li liThe partition must be flagged as active in the MBR table. By "active", I mean "bootable". The active partition is marked with an asterisk code*/code character in first column of the output from the  precodesudo  fdisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  command. You can use the  precodesudo  fdisk  -e  /dev/disk0 /code/pre  command to change the active partition. The proper interactive command is codeflag/code./li /ol     Note: More information on the codefdisk/code command can be found by entering the command codeman  fdisk/code or online here.   I also had additional requirements.   ol liThe Mac needs to be set to boot using legacy mode. This can be done with the codebless/code command. In my case, I was installing to the 4th partition on disk 0, so I used the following.  precodesudo  bless  --device  /dev/disk0s4  --setBoot  --legacy /code/pre  The code0/code represents codedisk0/code and the code4/code represents the 4th partition. Actually, when booting in legacy mode, the partition is chosen by the bootstrap code stored in the MBR. It is safe to assume this code will choose the partition set active in the above step 4. So when booting, the partition value set by the bless command will be ignored./li liThe MBR must contain valid bootstrap code or no bootstrap code. OS X is installed without this code. This is why you see the warning message below when using the codefdisk/code command to change the MBR.  precodefdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory /code/pre  When I installed FreeDOS, the MBR contained the bootstrap code that was being used by Windows 10.  You can view the contents of your MBR by using the following command.  precodesudo  hexdump  -C  -v  -n  512  /dev/disk0 /code/pre  If you are unsure if the bootstrap code in your MBR is valid, you can zero out this memory by using the following command. The bootstrap code occupies hex addresses 0 through 1B7.  precodesudo  fdisk  -u  -f  /dev/zero  -y  /dev/disk0 /code/pre/li /ol  At this point, you should be able to start installing FreeDOS using the DVD. I chose to install everything.  When I reached the display shown below, the computer seemed to freeze. In reality, the computer was just taking a long time to install software. More that just the Kernel is being installed here. This is why the progress bar does not seem to change.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fmHQx.png" alt="web"  Also, in some of the subsequent steps, I needed to press the space bar several times before the installation would proceed.  When reached the step associated with the display below, I chose code1/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpXfR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment285946> My purpose for installing FreeDOS is to be able to run SpinRite on my Mac. Unfortunately, VirtualBox, VMWare, etc. block much of what SpinRite does. I was simply hoping to find a solution that would eliminate the need to pull the drive out of the machine and hook it up to a PC. <comment285954> @ericgorr: I assume then there is something physically wrong with your internal hard disk? Otherwise, what would be the point of needing SpinRite? Also, what is the model/year of your Mac? <comment285963> My hard drive appears to be operating just fine. I simply want to be able to use SpinRite for it's problem prevention and maintenance capabilities. Mac Pro Mid 2012. <comment285990> @ericgorr: I updated my answer. I would try to create a USB FreeDOS flash drive installer from the FreeDOS iso. Let me know if you succeed and I will further update my answer. <comment285996> Good work. Keep in mind, the system tracks revisions, so rather than putting Update 1, update 2, etc.. Just edit the post to contain a clear answer and either move the troubleshooting to the bottom of the post or remove old information entirely. <comment286040> I am running El Capitan. I do have a DVD drive. Additionally, I have an advantage of having a second internal HD (250gb) which I can dedicate in part or in whole for this purpose. I can format it however I like. I can certainly create my own bootable DVD. Can you describe how, exactly, you did that? <comment286053> @ericgorr: I downloaded the file `fd11src.iso`. To burn to a DVD, locate the file in the Finder application. Right click on the file and select **Burn Disk Image "fd11src.iso" to Disk...**. I use a RW DVD, which takes longer to burn, but is reusable. <comment286250> I was able to burn the DVD to create an installer disk. Then, following the general set of instructions as found at http://freedos.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/VirtualBox_-_Chapter_5, I can get to the point where it is about to install the FreeDOS kernel and that fails. I am attempting to install it to the second HD which is 250gb. <comment286263> I also found these instructions - http://randomcomputerbits.blogspot.com/2008/02/tutorial-installing-freedos-on-intel.html but the results were the same. <comment286477> I assume you were not able to instal FreeDOS to either internal disk. Is this true? <comment286490> In case it wasn't clear, I am not able to get it installed yet, but I am able to boot the FreeDOS installer from a DVD. <comment286491> @ericgorr: I might try seeing if I can install FreeDOS on my 2007 iMac. First, I have to find a place to backup my Windows 10, just in case. <comment286529> @ericgorr: We you get your computer to boot FreeDOS, your display should look like [this](http://imgur.com/wOkyGp2). Well, at least this is what my iMac displays. <comment286570> When I boot from the DVD, it goes to the installer as shown in the first step here http://freedos.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/VirtualBox_-_Chapter_5
