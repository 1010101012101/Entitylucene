SongBeamer Print pdf <body> I need export the songs of SongBeamer with the accords as PDF on an MacBook. On Windows I can press Print and then select pdf as print options. with the MacBook I can't do the same. I have add an printscreen of the program. Do someone know how to print as PDF in SongBeamer? Thanks in advantage img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RV6ZX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now after all the work. I will thank you all for the helping. I have contact the vendor. He have released a new version of SongBeamer just for this case. Here the Link: Download (today is the: 06.01.2017) Just in case please go to the website and watch out for a newer version. If there is one then download it. Probably it will be more stable.   <answer267647> Don't know whether I did something special, but if you change the name of the printer there is an option to print to PDF.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzedx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer267648> By the looks of it, because whoever coded it thought they knew better than Apple, so completely ignored the Mac-standard toolbox &amp; wrote their own print dialog - &amp; in the process forgot there's a reason to use standard toolboxes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZJ1j.png" alt="enter image description here"  From Patrix's answer, it may be possible to add an Adobe pdf 'printer' from System Prefs  Printers &amp; scanners.br Click the + sign at the bottom &amp; see if you are offered one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/244C5.png" alt="enter image description here"  I think mine may have come from an old install of Adobe Acrobat which I no longer have. If so, maybe see if they do a free trial, which might just get you the PDF Printer as an add-on.br I found this link to a free trial of Acrobat which may offer the same thing as I have, though untested.  <comment335855> I havn't add any printer.  The pdf printer isn't there as well. Do you have a special pdf tool? <comment335856> and what do you suggest to do? <comment335857> You will get better answers by contacting the vendor directly (https://songbeamer.com/support.htm). <comment335858> First, complain at whoever wrote it, but in the meantime you may be able to get the same additional dialog as @Patrix - I'll add to the answer... <comment335860> my problem is, there is no Option to get this additional dialog. I have no idea where he gets them. <comment335861> You have the same 'drucker' option as on Patrix's picture... now gone :/ <comment335862> Hey, i have installed the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC and I cant add a pdf printer? there is nothing to add I can't find anything <comment335863> It's back :-) But I don't have the "Adobe PDF" option in my Printer settings. <comment335864> 'Reader' is not 'writer' - try the link I just added <comment335865> @rikvola Please contact the vendor (they have both a support form and a user forum on their site). You paid for the software, they should support you as well here. <comment335866> LOL. Your link points to software requiring "Apple System software 7.1" and delivered as a SEA file. Don't think this will work in macOS :-) <comment335867> hahaha - sorry, i didn't check - updated to link for Acrobat DC free trial, which may offer the same thing. Confusion was it said 8.5.1, mine is 8 & quite old... so I *assumed* it was a later version :/ <comment335868> soo thanks, I don't know if i do something wrong, but now i have installed following programs: Acrobat Distiller, Adobe Acrobat, Some Launcher and Creative cloud. I tried you're first link, and it was broken. Now I don't find it anymore. I cannot set up the adobe printer as additional option. it is shown only if the program is programmed well in the "pdf" section wich isn't in SongBeamer. I have write to the vendor of this tool. It's really hard to do a so simple task. <comment335877> I have add a fixing in the description, I'm not a Stackexchange poweruser, but I think this is the right way.
