Can VirtualBox prevent Mac OS X Yosemite to boot properly? <body> After a few days of good experience with Yosemite, my Macbook pro cannot boot anymore. After 30 or 40% of boot, it just restarts. Here are what I did to fix it:  ul liBooting to single-user, runnign codefsck -fy/code, since the laptop fallen one day or two ago and I was suspicious about hard drive. But codefsck/code told everything is fine with my hard drive. I don't think it is checking bad sectors./li liResetting PRAM/li liBooting to Recovery, checking hard disk via Disk Utilities/li liReinstalling Yosemite from OS X Utilities/li /ul  Now it does not even boot into recovery (reboots after 30%).  My last try was to verbose boot, and the last message printed out before rebooting was:  precodeVBoxDrv: Failed to open kernel symbols (rc=-102) /code/pre  In another try, the last message was:  precodeVBoxAdpDrv: version (some number) /code/pre  I had VirtualBox installed on my MacBook and worked prior to upgrading to Yosemite (in Mavericks). I did not check it in Yosemite.  So my question is: can VirtualBox prevent Yosemite from boot? Can I uninstall it using single-user boot (which is the only successful boot on my computer now)? Or do you have a better idea to get it fixed?  <answer156438> Finally I found a serious hardware error (failure of main board) was preventing installation of Yosomite. The reason I saw Virtual Box error was just a matter of chance, it printed out the lost error message before the computer crashed due to the main board error  <comment180728> Obviously your is doing something it should not. <comment180731> @Buscar웃 I was very hopeful to recover it after removing all VirtualBox components in single-user mode. I removed everything including *vbox* from /, now it won't prompt any messages about Vbox in the verbose mode, but reboots again (no particular messages are shown before reboot). Any ideas? <comment180732> no other then cmd-r to restore your Yosemite and disconnect any external devices. otherwise run the AHT (apple hardware test) <comment180733> @Buscar웃 I am afraid cmd-r is not working anymore. The reboot happens before OS X Utilities are shown :-(
