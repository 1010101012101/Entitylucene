Passing arguments to 'Run Shell Script' in Automator <body> I want to make an Automator workflow to run a shell command. For example, I want to receive text input from the user and treat that input as a shell command instead of text. I have tried passing argument as codestdin/code but still not able to make it work. Here is a simple example of what I am trying to do:  The user input some text, say, 'xyz'. I want to pass this text to shell script as follow  precodeecho "$1/" /code/pre  to get codexyz/code as the output of the shell script to show in emshow result/em action of Automator.  <answer222723> When passing eminput/em to strongRun Shell Script/strong in strongAutomator/strong you need to change strongPass input: to stdin/strong to strongPass input: as arguments/strong as shown in the example workflow below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oj6vC.png" alt="enter image description here"
