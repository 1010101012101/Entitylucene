OSX Calendar not showing Exchange Account <body> So because the mail app from Apple is far from perfect and never showed me the date and time of calendar invites from MS Exchange environments (after the Yosemite update) I was adviced to re-add the exchange account in Preferences - Internet Accounts.  After doing that, the calendar app just won't show the exchange account anymore. It's right there in the settings, but not in the panel:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZlgsI.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vizsm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can anyone tell me how I get my exchange calendar back to the calendar app?  Thanks in advance for any help.  PS.: the bug in mail (no date&amp;time for cal invites) wasn't fixed by this btw.  <answer216972> You could try clearing the calendar cache and see if that resolves it:  Quit Calendar  Go to code~/Library//code by typing ⌘+⇧+G in the Finder and copying that path into the dialog that shows.  In the code~/Library/Caches//code folder, look for codecom.apple.ical/code and move it out to your Desktop (it might not exist).  In the code~/Library/Calendar//code folder look for files named codeCalendar Cache/code and move them out to your Desktop.  Reopen Calendar  At this point, you might also want to try disabling and re-enabling your Exchange account in the Calendars Accounts pane.  <answer216973> Select "Enable this account" in Calendar - Preferences - Account tab.  <answer217046> I recently encountered this on a Mac running 10.11 El Capitan. The Exchange account was active in System Preferences - Internet Accounts and the Calendar was checked to sync, but the Exchange calendar did not show up in the sidebar of the Calendar application.  To resolve this, we deleted the Exchange account in Internet Accounts and then re-added it back in.  <answer218209> I feel stupid for answering this myself because the "fix" is idiotic.  ol liRemove the exchange account/li liRestart the mac/li liadd the account back - everything works./li /ol  I hope another answer gets two upvotes if they help someone so they're assigned the bounty I put out on this question. Thanks for the answers!  <answer234636> I also had this problem.  What worked for me was a hybrid of the two suggested solutions so far:  ol liGo to Calendar - Preferences - Account/li liDe-select "Enable this account"/li liRe-select "Enable this account"/li /ol  Now the account shows up.  <answer251684> I also had this problem. What worked for me was to go to Settings  Internet account.  Under Exchange panel, uncheck calendar and recheck it. Then all the events from Exchange appears on iCal.   In my case, changing preference on Calendar itself doesn't work.  <answer288402> Reboot worked with Sierra also thanks.  <comment262273> It looks like it is already enabled, the second image in his screenshot is the Calendars account pane, the Exchange entry would be greyed out if it were disabled. <comment262293> yup, it's enabled. Mail works. <comment360823> I only had to make it inactive and then reactivate it. No reboot. <comment364199> Welcome to Ask Different!.  Please refrain from adding comments in an Answer.
