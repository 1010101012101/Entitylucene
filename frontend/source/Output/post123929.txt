Can't connect to a specific server via http or ftp on macbook/imac (ok on iPhone) <body> More often than not I can't connect to my clients server via web and ftp, it may occasionally work (once every couple of days) but then after a couple of page requests it stops responding - it's like it's not there. I've attempted this on three different macs and four different internet connections.  The resources in question:  ul liweb front end: www.avenueevents.co.uk/li lihttp control panel: cp1.oosha.co.uk:xxxx/li liftp or sftp: avenueevents.co.uk/li /ul  all resolve to the same server IP and when the issue occurs I see request timeouts in browser (Safari, ff, chrome) and over ftp (terminal, interarchy, filezilla).  Seemingly, after the first couple of requests on any of these protocols, the server stops responding across all protocols.  This is an odd one  - I've been a freelance web designer for a few years now and I've never seen this before.  When the server isn't responding, and I then use my iPhone over the same internet connection, then I also get timeouts. However, strongover 3G everything works fine/strong - web, control panel and ftp/sftp. It's as if a piece of equipment somewhere along the route is just going dead to my macs.  I've tried many restarts, resetting browsers, clearing dns cache and even tried clearing my ssl cache (although I'm not confident that this was down properly) and all to no-avail.  Tech support for the hosting company (oosha) are adamant that everything is working fine, and if I can connect ok with my iPhone then this surely confirms that. So what is up with these macs?  I'm running OS X Lion on one of them and OS X Mavericks on the other two. I have kapersky installed on one of them, but nothing on the other two. On my macbook I have tried with three different internet connections (BT, sky, talktalk) and still the same result.  strongISP / infrastructure detail:/strong  ol liTalkTalk FTTC home router (Huawei HG533, Lan connection) with standard settings except for port forwarding.

Not normally that bad. <comment144943> Try using Netstat to narrow down the network problem nicely explained here (or other places) http://pcsupport.about.com/od/commandlinereference/p/netstat-command.htm, also just run a coninuos ping to see a possible slowdown in network to the point of no connection <comment144981> The trace route speeds are much faster today, but the connection issues remain. I had a play with netstat but I can't see anything obvious that may be causing this.
