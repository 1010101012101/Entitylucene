Copy new files only - is this possible? Basically want to merge two folders <body> I have a folder on Drive 1 called Music, and it is 100GB. I have a folder on Drive 2 called Music, and it is 116GB. It's the most updated version. How do I copy the Music folder from Drive 2 to Drive 1 without having to rewrite every single file?  <answer51255> Not sure why the default Lion Merge button doesn't show up for me. But I ended up using codeditto/code. Found here: https://superuser.com/a/221599/102789  <answer51258> The merge option will only show up if you are copying (rather than moving) the folder. Make sure you hold kbdoption/kbd while you drag the new folder to the location of the old folder. Alternatively, using kbd⌘/kbd+kbdc/kbd to copy the new folder and kbd⌘/kbd+kbdv/kbd to paste over the old folder should give you the option to merge the files.  <answer116485> This is a classic use case for rsync:  precodersync -av /source-path/source-dir /destination-path /code/pre  rsync will copy only new and changed files to the new location.  It is important to understand how a trailing slash on the source argument functions.  If there is a trailing slash then the contents of em/source-path/source-dir/em will be copied to emdestination-path/em.  If there is no trailing slash then emsource-dir/em itself will be copied to the destination and its contents will be another level down in the destination hierarchy.  So if you want to replicate one path to another include the trailing slash as follows:  precodersync -av /sourcepath/sourcedir/ /duplicatpath/sourcedir/ /code/pre  <answer286928> Check the strongcodecp/code/strong command. Use codeman cp/code and read the options. You can do something like: br  strongcodecp -r -u ~/source ~/destination/code/strong     -R, strong-r/strong, --recursive : copy directories recursively br    strong-u/strong, --update : copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missingbr   strong-p/strong same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps br   strong-v/strong --verbose : explain what is being done   So if you want to copy files from you strongDownloads/music/strong folder to say your strongMusic/new/strong folder you would do something as: br strongcodecp -ruvp ~/Downloads/music/* ~/Music/new//code/strong br This would merge the contents of these two folders and if two files with the same name and path exist it would keep the newest one based on the timestamp.  <comment58586> Which version of OS X are you using? <comment58587> I am using 10.7.4. When I copy the folder from one drive to the other, I'm asked if I want to replace. No merge option. <comment281108> This still seems to write over files that don't need to be rewritten. Using `rsync` instead <comment281109> Great catch! And if you're doing this from multiple drives (or anywhere on your computer) and don't want to type out the directories you can just drag a drive (external usb, or time capsule) or just a specific directory and have it add it to the command for you.  Just drag the target location into terminal <comment292855> BE CAREFUL! ditto does not keep newer files, it always overwrites destination with source. If source file is older, it will zap away the new file and replace with older file <comment308821> Man, thank you so much for suggesting the trailing slash. I've spent ours pondering why rsync -av ./foo/bar /vol1/foo/bar was copying over all existing files. Bloody slashes lol!!! <comment337366> Even if option to merge is available it sometimes does not work (just reports an error and do nothing) - especially in case of big folders as in your case. It's another reason why you should use rsync. <comment337367> that's right - very important warning from FrancescoMM, use rsync <comment369529> Are you sure the -u option works with the cp command in OSX? I'm getting the message "cp: illegal option -- u" in Sierra. It seems not all commands are the same as in Linux. <comment369738> Try the cp --help command and see if the option is available. Or check the cp --version and make sure it is up to date. I am using : cp (GNU coreutils) 8.27 <comment374402> Sadly, -u is not a valid flag for cp on OS X. It would be very convenient to have!
