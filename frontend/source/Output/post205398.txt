Apple Numbers x-axis "Value Labels" can't be set to "Date & Time" or "Duration" <body> I am graphing a two-column data set that looks like this:  precode1/1/1963    3,209,827,882 1/1/1964    3,281,201,306 1/1/1965    3,350,425,793 /code/pre  But when I try to set the Value Labels in either a Line Chart or a Scatter Plot to "Date &amp; Time" or "Duration" I find that they are greyed out.  Why would this be? In what situations is it possible to use these two options?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHaCV.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jvomn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer205403> Make sure the source columns are formatted as the proper date/time format.
