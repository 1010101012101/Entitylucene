How to get multichannel working on Macs? (for Vox especially) <body> I have a receiver, Denon AVR-1802, which is capable of doing Dolby Digital and DTS decoding.  Now my problem really have nothing to do with movies and these high-end audio codecs. My problem is simple, how can I get my Mac to recognize it as multichannel output in Audio MIDI Utility? I output the audio with S/PDIF.  I need it so Vox will do the proper stereo to surround conversion.
