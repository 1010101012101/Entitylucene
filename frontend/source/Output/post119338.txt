I lost my data on iPad 2 <body> I updated my iPad 2 to iOS 7. It blocked and asked me to plug it to iTunes. I did connect it to computer then I was asked to restore the iPad. I am afraid I lost all my data and I don't have the access now to syncronise it to computer.  Is there any way how to recover my data from iPad updated before restoring it?  <answer119342> How about using iCloud? Backup everything before you start restoring. http://www.icloud.com  Another Way how to Backup iPad 2 : https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4542101  Hope this will help you.  <comment139200> There are dozens of questions here covering the basics.
