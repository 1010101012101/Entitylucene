What screwdriver to tighten bottom rMBP screws? <body> What screwdriver to buy to tighten bottom screws on MacBook Pro Retina?   Based on search, it seams to be pentalobe flower. But what are dimensions? Are there any variances?   <answer92360> I would suggest iFixit's MacBook Pro and Air 5-Point Pentalobe Screwdriver.  <comment108362> Are you sure - do you have rMBP? I googled this one also but when I compare the shape is different. The screws on rMBP looks like flower while this screwdriver shape looks like star. To be sure, I'd like to check dimensions too. <comment108364> According to the product page, and iFixit's tear downs of *both* the [15"](http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Mid+2012+Teardown/9462/1) and [13"](http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2012+Teardown/11225/1) late 2012 retina macs, this is the correct driver. <comment108509> The image (especially the leftmost) definitely looks like a Torx screwdriver.  Maybe that also fits into and engages a pentalobe (and they sell it because Torx is fairly common while pentalobe is Apple smemi proprietary), but the shape is not a genuine pentalobe. <comment108510> Sorry, I stand corrected.  Looked again and Torx is a 6-edge star.  Pretty likely that iFixit thing will do the job, even though it has a starry base form.
