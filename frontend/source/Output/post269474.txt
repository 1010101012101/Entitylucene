Surface Pro to Apple thunderbolt display 27 <body> Want to display the Surface Pro in a second monitor that is a Apple Thunderbolt Display 27.  Surface has Mini Display port  Apple has Thunderbolt cable  both are physically the same but the tech is different.   What can i do to send image to the Apple Display ?  tks for the help !  <answer269481> Nope, not possible, Apple Thunderbolt Display requires a Thunderbolt port which the Surface Pro and Pre-2011 MacBooks don't have (even though mini-DisplayPort have exactly the same connector).
