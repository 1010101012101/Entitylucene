icdd process consuming substantial memory on macOS <body> In the past week or so the process 'icdd' has been starting from time to time and when it does it consumes massive amount of RAM (upwards of 7 GB). When this happens, my MacBook Pro essentially becomes non-functional until I can open the Activity Monitor and force-kill the process.   I've attached a screenshot of the activity monitor showing icdd using over 7GB of RAM and making the memory pressure skyrocket.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIVPn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone know what this process is or how I can prevent this issue from occurring every 30 minutes or so?  <answer270484> I have been dealing with this problem for a while and have been checking everywhere! It is frustrating ... Finally I found a link that I could stop this stupid madness. I am not sure if this is the source of the problem but it could stop it. Here are the steps:     1) disable SIP (link)      2) type the following commands:           cd /Applications          sudo mv Image\ Capture.app/ Disable\ Image\ Capture.app/          cd /System/Library/Image\ Capture/Support/          sudo mv icdd icdd-disable         3) reboot      4) enable SIP if you care   Original link: https://havecamerawilltravel.com/photographer/prevent-photos-app-mac-osx  Hopefully it helps.  <answer276397> I've been struggling with this problem as well. Not finding answers online and not wanting to mess with terminal, I called Apple Support. Initially, they thought my HD was corrupted (it was - that was fixed but did not fix the problem). The problem persisted after increasing my RAM. Prompted by an internet comment regarding network scanner searches, I noticed that ICDD would only get crazy when Wi-Fi was enabled. If I disconnected from wi-Fi and quit ICDD, it would not restart and climb in RAM or CPU usage (until Wi-Fi reenabled).  I called Apple Support again who seem to have fixed the problem by resetting SMC and NVRAM. Now ICDD runs at a low level (10-20 MB) rather than consuming 10+ GB of RAM. I've added links below for doing those, but I'd recommend calling Apple Support for your specific problem.  Their explanation for why this is happening had to do with my RAM being clogged or full with internet caches, etc. Why it has just now become apparent and whether it is associated with Sierra, I cannot say.  I hope this helps some people!  Reset SMC: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201295  Reset NVRAM: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204063  10-15mins fix.

See if this answer helps: http://superuser.com/questions/748933/mac-rogue-process-in-activity-monitor-launchd-installer-eating-up-memory-cpu <comment322913> icdd is related to the Image Capture.app/service. Do you have any devices like a scanner, printer-scanner or camera attached? <comment322914> Also - if you log out and then back in - how does the 7.24 used (1.08 App, 1.75 Wired. 4.41 Compressed) change? It could be a simple memory leak that logging out and in clears. If it doesn't clear, I'd try disabling the virus scanner and rebooting and seeing if memory climbs as fast. <comment322915> That solution was not applicable to my issue. @klanomath I have no external devices attached to my MacBook. <comment322917> @Zach lcdd is controlled by a launch agent. It contains a key "Enable pressure exit" which is disabled by default. You may enable it temporarily (=kill lcdd if memory pressure gets to high) and check the result. Like bmike already mentioned the real reason probably is a memory leak though... <comment338723> I've been troubleshooting this for a few weeks now, it is a major battery drain. It fires up every few minutes and burns about 5% of the battery in a few seconds, running one or more cores at 100%. <comment338727> All I've been able to figure out is that it is coming up to scan the network for networked scanners. This seems to happen every few minutes (and, at a university, there are a great many networked scanners, apparently). Watching the console, it's just adding and removing networked scanners constantly. <comment338729> Also, I have tried disabling SIP and editing the com.apple.icdd.plist to enabled pressured memory exit; it doesn't do any good. In fact, I have tried almost all of the settings in there; disabled prevents it from happening, but also completely breaks Preview.app.
