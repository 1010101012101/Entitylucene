Java Web Start launched in Finder says no JRE available. Works fine in console <body> Followed solution here - Java for OS X 2012-006: How to re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 applet plug-in and Web Start functionality  to restore browser java plug-in, works fine now.  But still can not launch jnlp application. If I launch it by simply double-clicking in finder I get message that I need to download Java Runtime Environment.  At the same time if I use terminal and write codejavaws myapp.jnlp/code it launches correctly.  What the issue may be and how can I fix it?  precode$ java -version java version "1.6.0_37" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_37-b06-434-11M3909) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.12-b01-434, mixed mode) /code/pre  Update: I have updated to 1.7 and now it works correctly. Just for your information.  <comment82405> What does `java -version` show? What OS X version do you use? <comment82415> I believe the latest Apple update - 1.6.0_37 <comment82418> It'd be great if you *knew* it :-) I asked because I installed Oracle Java 7 on my MacBook Pro but LibreOffice complained and OS X wanted to install Java. I finally gave up, uninstalled Java 7 and installed Apple's Java. I wonder what would get installed on your Mac if you accepted the request to download a JRE... <comment82476> If I click on 'More info' button in the window I get transferred to Oracle site which offers Java 7 to install. Updated Java information.
