Configuring XAMPP on macOS Sierra (version 10.12.6) <body> On a fresh installation of macOS, I decided to use XAMPP (I have previously used MAMP (free ver.)) but I have encountered some simple issues.  ol liThe general tab shows IP address code192.168.64.2/code but my system IP is code192.168.1.100/code. Why is the IP different by default? And how can this be changed to use the same? The code"go to application page"/code loads dashboard on code192.168.64.2/code but I'd like to use the localhost on some port like codelocalhost:8888/code / code127.0.0.1:8888/code./li liTrying to open codephpmyadmin/code returned an access forbidden page ("... New XAMPP security concept: ..."). I looked up about it in google which showed results suggesting to edit the configuration file to allow external access. I'd like to keep it to localhost, so I guess the IP has to be changed to localhost. How can that be achieved?/li liUnlike MAMP, there is no option to set the port within the application, so I tried to look for the httpd file in `Applications-XAMPP-(show package contents)-contents-... but did not find the file. So where are the configuration files?/li /ol     P.S. Do not suggest to turn off the system provided apache server   (codesudo apachectl stop/code)
