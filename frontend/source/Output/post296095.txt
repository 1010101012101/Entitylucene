Change "Group windows by application" preference using command line <body> As per the title I'd like to configure the preference entitled  codeGroup windows by application/code which is found in Preferences  Mission Control.  Most settings seem to have something like  precodedefaults write com.apple.xxxx setting-name -bool false /code/pre  But i can't seem to find one for this setting.  <answer296097> The codedefaults/code emcommand/em for strongGroup windows by application/strong in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongMission Control/strong is e.g.:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock expose-group-by-app -bool false /code/pre  ul liThe emvalue/em can be codetrue/code or codefalse/code./li /ul  However, that will not immediately change it in the UI and it may get overwritten anyway.  The safest way to change it is from the UI.  Note: As suggested in the emcomments/em one can use codekillall Dock/code directly afterwards however, codekillall Dock/code will force all minimized windows to show, as well as it's visually disruptive. I'd suggest using AppleScript to change it as it will not force minimized windows to show nor it is as visually disruptive.  The following strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em will emcheck/uncheck/em the strongGroup windows by application/strong emcheckbox/em in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongMission Control/strong, and will not cause the same visual disruption that codekillall Dock/code will. It can be saved as an strongAppleScript/strong emapplication/em in strongScrip Editor/strong.  precodetell application "System Preferences"     set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.expose"     tell application "System Events"         click checkbox "Group windows by application" of group 2 of window "Mission Control" of application process "System Preferences"     end tell     quit end tell /code/pre  Note; This AppleScript emcode/em was tested under macOS 10.12.5 and my need adjusting for some earlier versions of OS X.  <comment373935> You might want to follow that `defaults` command with `killall Dock` to restart the Dock process. <comment373937> @IconDaemon, Yes one can do that however `killall Dock` will force all minimized windows to show as well as it's visually disruptive.
