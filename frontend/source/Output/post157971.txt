How to change the Text Wrap default in Pages <body> When I add a picture to document in Pages, the Text Wrap is always Automatic. I want to set "Above and Below" to be default. How can I do this?  The version is 5.5.1(2111)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/19VN1.jpg" alt="The screen shot"  <answer158354> With codePages '09/code (version 4.3 ¹):  ol liSelect a picture/li liConfigure it completly as you wish/li liDefine it as the default image style:  codeFormat &gt; Advanced &gt; Define Default Image Style/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cQJ3k.png" alt="Define Default Image Style"  hr With codePages 5/code (version 5.5.1):  ol liThis function is missing./li liThe creation of an codeImage Style/code doesn't permit to save the codeText Wrap/code tuning./li /ol  hr ¹)  I removed my installation of codePages '11/code due to its lack of functions. Its documentation isn't available on the Apple web server: Pages manuals.  <comment186188> my pages version is 5.5.1(2111). I cannot find `Define Default Image Style` option <comment187163> The most approaching function within `Pages 5` is: `Format  Advanced  Create Image Style`. But it is a failure to answer your legitimate need. I have the same basic need and use it everytime I include an image with `Pages '09`. <comment188555> Good question. No decent answer. May I suggest you to place a request for improvment here: https://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html.
