How can I redirect the output of screen to a file? <body> I'm trying to capture data from a Serial Port by opening 'screen' from the terminal. It works, I see the data coming but I can't figure out how to save it to a file.  I tried to redirect the output of screen by adding code file.txt/code to the command line that opens screen, something like this:  precodescreen /dev/tty.Airconsole-1 &gt; file.txt /code/pre  But it didn't work, it creates an empty file but I still see the data on the screen window.  Ideally I would like to redirect to both, I mean keep it in the window and at the same time feeding the file, probably by using the tee command.  <answer168403> Found possible answer at Stack Overflow:  Have you tried:  precodescreen -L /dev/tty.Airconsole-1 &gt; file.txt /code/pre  <comment197684> No, I haven't tried the log option. I was looking to redirect the output as it comes, but will try it and will try the last answer in the link you sent me, the one with script. Thanks. <comment198494> Tried the linked answer, the one with script and works precisely as expected. Thank you very much.
