Safari: swap alt modifier with cmd <body> I use Firefox and Chrome as my main navigators, but I use sometimes Safari to test some developments.  On Firefox and Chrome, typing an URL in the address bar and then pressing kbdAlt/kbd + kbdReturn/kbd makes a new tab to be opened.  On Safari, typing an URL in the address bar and then pressing kbdAlt/kbd + kbdReturn/kbd makes the target address saved to a file (which annoys me because it makes an unuseful file in my Download folder).  To open a new tab after typing the address, I have to use the kbdCmd/kbd + kbdReturn/kbd.  I wonder if it is possible to swap cmd and alt key only for Safari (not other apps) and how to do this, or at least make Safari open a new tab when I press kbdAlt/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd in the address bar.  One last thing: I am on Mavericks  Any idea ?  <answer120116> You can use strongKarabiner/strong with a private.xml such as this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;appdef&gt;     &lt;appname&gt;SAFARI&lt;/appname&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.apple.Safari&lt;/equal&gt;   &lt;/appdef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Swap ⌥↩︎ and ⌘↩︎&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;SwapAltEnterAndCmdEnter&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;only&gt;SAFARI&lt;/only&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__       KeyCode::RETURN, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE,       KeyCode::RETURN, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L     &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__       KeyCode::RETURN, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE,       KeyCode::RETURN, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  You can find the manual here to know how to edit the private.xml file and update your configuration.  You have to check the small checkbox of the newly defined rule to make it work.  <comment140103> The **KeyRemap4MacBook** expert to the rescue ;) <comment140801> Great! I have to add that you can read the manual here to know how to edit the private.xml file: https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/document.html.en.
