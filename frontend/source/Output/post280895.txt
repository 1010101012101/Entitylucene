Turn off emoticons in iOS <body> I'd like to be able to stop iOS automatically converting emoticons as pictures. I want it so that, for example, instead of a picture of a smiling face my phone displays the raw characters of a colon followed by a right bracket [ :) ].  Anyone have any more thoughts on this?   <answer280907> It's a feature of iOS 10. You'll have to delete the emoji keyboard to get rid of that, by going to Settings  General  Keyboards.   Since iOS 10 introduced the predictive text feature, you can type in English and have words corrected in other languages, provided that the keyboard is enabled.  <comment353338> Could you clarify what version of iOS you're running? <comment353339> 10.3.1 on both iPhone and iPad <comment353360> I don't have the emoticon keyboard enabled. I still see them converted to pictures regardless of whether the keyboard is enabled or not. <comment353362> It happens on multiple different apps - Mail, Messages, Safari, Chrome. <comment353374> Are you certain that what is being sent is not actually an emoji? Neither my Mac nor iPhone auto-translate :) nor anything else, to an emoji. iOS will offer a replacement, but if you don't accept it, it will not send one. <comment353376> Yes I'm certain it is an emoticon <comment353386> Nonsense, the keyboard has nothing to do with this. <comment353413> I didn't say the keyboard was responsible, I was replying to someone who suggested that it might be. <comment353415> @user29742 my comment, like your first one, is addressed to the person posting the "answer" <comment353459> Ah,  my apologies.
