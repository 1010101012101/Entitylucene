MacBook Pro Retina not charging <body> So my MacBook was on 2% so I tried charging it but it worked at first ,but then a little later another message came up saying that the macbook was low battery and then I realized that the cord was not plugged in so I plugged it in to my MacBook but it won't charge this time. I figured since the computer was kinda overheated I decieded to shut it down and then charge it but now it won't charge, I even used a different charger (that works) but nothing and using a different outlet as well. When I try turning it on it just has simple of needing to be charge but when I plug in a charger it won't charge my MacBook at all. Can someone tell me what to do?????  <answer165091> It is possible your Power Management got messed up  Reset the SMC following this instructions:.  That should fix the problem, unless your battery is fried.
