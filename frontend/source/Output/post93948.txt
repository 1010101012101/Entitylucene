Terminal bash commands stopped working <body> I was trying to install some stuff for scala development on my MAC, and probably I managed broke the shell/terminal while I was mindlessly running some scripts that I don't know.  Now when I start the terminal it always starts with this line;  precode$ /sbin:sbin:/usr/local/bin': not a valid identifier /code/pre  And now when I try, I see some bash commands does not work, for instance grep, syslog..etc I get an error saying;  precode-bash syslog: "no such file or directory"    /code/pre  Any idea what is wrong and how can I fix this  <answer93951> Try to edit the .profile or .bash_rc file on the terminal   precode /usr/bin/vi ~/.profile /code/pre  and see if one of the software has put stuff in there that should not be there (especially if one has put up a messed PATH command there).  (Alternately but less likely affected are  code/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/vi /etc/profile/code or code/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/vi /etc/bashrc/code).  If you don't know how to use the VI editor, you can also use code/usr/bin/nano/code instead of code/usr/bin/vi/code  For a start, until you find where this happens, editing the .profile (see above) you can put the following command as the last command to the end of your ~/.profile file.  precodeexport PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin /code/pre  This should at least give you back access to your normal commands.  <comment110156> What files did you edit did you edit when you did the install - probably your shell initialization files e.g. .bashrc, .bash_profile and others <comment110157> tnx for the quick fix I will try that, but I didnt understand what should I do with the files you mentioned, and no idea how should I edit them <comment110158> For a first diag (most likely culprit), show/add the current content of your ~/.profile file in your question text <comment110159> tnx I will do it in evening <comment110217> I just checked, there is no .profile file under ~/. how should I put it back? I dont use time machine <comment110218> ahh I checked bashprofile file. and there was an extra space in one of the paths! problem solved! but .profile is still missing..hope thats not a problem <comment265882> FYI, to disable customizations so you can start a shell to edit a shell startup script, you can use Terminal's **Shell  New Command** item to run `bash --noprofile`, which will start Bash without running the login script.
