Would Apple reject an app mentioning the 30 / 70 income split? <body> The idea is that if you want to keep the same income from selling both on the App Store and on your website, you would have to increase the App Store price, because the App Store takes a 30% cut of whatever you make.  Would a message like "Buying this [video, image, upgrade, feature etc.] will cost more when you buy it on the mobile device because Apple takes a 30% cut of the price" be a basis for rejection?  Technically I wouldn't be moving users to my website, but I could see how Apple can interpret it that way.  I'm looking to find out if anyone else tried this and has managed to get the app approved.  Thanks!  <comment216328> How would you plan to sell something on your website? You can't sell iOS apps through non-App Store sources (assuming no jailbreaking). <comment216330> I wouldn't be selling the iOS app, but a feature / premium product that would otherwise have to be bought through in-app purchases <comment216356> Haven't tried it but I'm almost positive wording it like that will get the app rejected. You cannot, in any way, attempt to steer users to purchase something from your site to avoid them buying it with IAP. You can, however, explain on your website that it costs less to purchase it there. They won't reject your app for statements on your website like that. (Presuming that screen doesn't show up in your app.) <comment216472> @tubedogg Yeah, fair point, I was sort of thinking that would be the case. I'm still curious if anybody has gone through this process with the App Store and what feedback they got <comment216517> You could always have the "buy this thing" button in your app just open an in-app browser pointed at your website. <comment216520> @user24601 I'm not actually selling a physical thing, I'm selling an unlock for an in-app purchase <comment216521> The same idea still works. Have a "buy" button open up an in-app browser to your website where people buy unlock codes. <comment216528> @user24601 I'm very sure that is a cause for rejection (i.e. opening an outside browser to buy the feature). That is why, for example, Amazon Kindle cannot point users outside the app to search and buy books
