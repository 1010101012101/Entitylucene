Identifying users who are sharing <body> When I select Restart from the Apple menu and get the alert "There is a user sharing this computer...", I would like to know which user (e.g. their IP address or some other identification) is sharing.  Is there a (Terminal) command to discover the addresses of sharing users?  (I'm not suspecting unauthorised users, rather I am trying to identify the source of a problem).  <answer143838> For network sharing you could do following in Terminal.  Assuming you have the file sharing enabled.  Applications using a file reference to your computer can mount a remote disk automatically, as long as the computer is on the network. A command like  precodenetstat -na | grep 548 /code/pre  will list what machine and user is connected by AFP.  If you simply type codenetstat/code it will list all active connection.  <comment169312> what kind of sharing do you have activated in your sys pref sharing. <comment169313> there are 2 kind of sharing. The Internet/Network and the no Internet/Network = Users of the computer. <comment169436> Network sharing.
