How to transfer a file from iPhone to computer when there is no Internet? <body> I have a word doc saved as an attachment in my inbox. I can read it using my iPhone 4S, but I can't edit it, and anyway, I want to edit it on my MacBook Pro. But there is (was) no Internet where I was, and so I couldn't access the file on my computer. Is there any way to transfer the file from my phone to computer using USB?  <answer52333> If you can transfer the document to a general-purpose app that "knows" about files (like GoodReader, Air Sharing, or iBooks), you should be able to access it from the file-handling dialog from within iTunes.   Most computers can create an ad-hoc WiFi network; using this, you'd use a network-sharing app (like Air Sharing) to mount a disk from your iPhone and transfer the files to your computer.  <answer52377> The PhoneView program can read files from iOS devices through USB and get them to your mac in most cases.  <comment59933> Wow. This is a pretty complex procedure for such a simple task.
