Is it possible to add description of an app when creating by Platypus? <body> I am creating an app by Platypus. Is there any way to strongadd description of an app/strong that would be visible in About menu? Or how it might be done?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3erRd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer296107> It seems I have found the solution: "If you add a file named Credits.rtf or Credits.html to the bundled files list, it will be displayed in the About window of your application.": http://www.sveinbjorn.org/files/manpages/PlatypusDocumentation.html#817  <comment374175> Please provide  the answer rather than just a link
