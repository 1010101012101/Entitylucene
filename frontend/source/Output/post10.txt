With multiple monitors, can I pick which one an application will load on? <body> In Spaces it's possible to specify which space a given application will open on -- for example, my web browser always opens on Space 1 and iTunes on Space 3.  Is something similar possible with multiple monitors, so that whichever space I'm on a certain application will always open on the second monitor?  For even more control, can I specify that it will always open on Monitor 2 of Space 4?  <answer31> Not with the default Apple Spaces.  There is an alternative, though. CocoaBots makes a small app called Hyperspaces which builds upon the default Spaces and adds a bunch of cool features. Multi-monitor support is coming to their next release.  http://thecocoabots.com/blog/post/148/hyperspaces-104-and-the-road-to-11/  <answer115> Stay App sounds like it might do what you want.     If youâ€™re fastidious about keeping   your windows tidy, Stay is for you.   Stay ensures that your windows are   always where you want them to be, even   as you connect and disconnect   displays.   <comment102> If you move an application to a different monitor, won't it remember that location and be there the next time you launch it? That's pretty much how it works on my setup. <comment258> It seems to depend on the application.  Terminal does remember, X-Windows doesn't, for example.
