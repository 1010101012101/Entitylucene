iOS 8.1 Settings "Handoff & Suggested Apps" doesn't exist <body> I am having difficulty getting Handoff and Continuity working correctly. Devices are iPhone 4S (iOS 8.1) and Mac Mini 2013 (Yosemite 10.10 14A389). Here is what I have done/confirmed:  ul liBoth devices are logged into the same iCloud account/li liBoth devices are connected to the same WiFi Network/li liBoth devices have bluetooth enabled/li liOSX  System Preferences  General  "Allow Handoff" is checked/li /ul  My problem is that on the iPhone, Settings  General  Handoff &amp; Suggested Apps does not exist as an option in the list.  I have deleted Bluetooth preferences on OS X as suggested on this answer.  Anyone know why this option is not presenting itself?  <answer153226> Handoff is not supported on an iPhone 4S as described in this article:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT6337/li /ul  <answer193943> You can install strongHandoff4S/strong from the BigBoss repository if your device is jailbroken, which will enable Continuity on iPhone 4s and allow the option to be shown in Settings.  <comment180420> iPhone 4S does support voice call continuity, but you are correct. [Here](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6337) is Apple's official list of supported devices and features for Continuity <comment181330> iPhone 4S has bluetooth 4.0 and was the first iPhone to have it and that is confirmed by Apple. :)
