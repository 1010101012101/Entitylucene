Is the boot menu (ALT on boot) black now? <body> I have a new MacBook Pro (mid 2015).  When I boot, I saw that now the apple is white on a black background. Okay maybe Apple has updated this design.  However, I find very odd the boot menu (the one we can access by pressing codeALT/code on boot).  I was used to this one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HSJta.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But now I have that one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4wjCm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  (Black square for privacy)  Is this normal? I am very surprise of such a design: a black background... and this grey rounded-square?  <comment256098> yeah... pretty sure that's just how it looks now.
