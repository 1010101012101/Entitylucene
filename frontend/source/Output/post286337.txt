In Pages, how to align left table cell text with page margin? <body> Here's a screenshot from Pages 6.1.1 on macOS Sierra.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ngA9.png" alt="enter image description here"  I added a table after some basic body text. I removed the table's cell borders and outlines. As you can see the text is not left aligned. Is there way to align it?  If this were HTML I would set the left padding of the first column's cells to 0px. I don't see how to do that, or anything equivalent, in Pages.
