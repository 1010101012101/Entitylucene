How do I delete items in my itunes download queue? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Delete a purchased file from ITunes Download Queue without downloading file       I have some episodes of a TV program in itunes (on my ipad) that I didn't download for a long time. If I try to download them now it says "download error. Tap to retry". A pop up says "Unable to download episode 13 - it could not be downloaded at this time". So I can't download them to delete them.  I also can't seem to remove these un-downloaded episodes from my itunes downloads queue. Nothing happens if I press the icon (like I would if I wanted to remove an app).  Does anyone know how I can remove them?   <answer70192> While an item is in the download queue, the user can't remove it.   You could contact the iTunes Store Customer Support department, which, apparently, deals with this kind of stuff, or try this emwibbly wobbly/em solution:  ol liGo to the Download page and find the small down-pointing arrow icon next to the emDownload Error. Tap to Retry/em./li liPut your finger on the arrow icon and do a quick swipe to the left./li liThe arrow will be replaced with a emDelete/em button./li liTap and confirm./li /ol  <comment251514> For some reason this doesn't work in iBooks. <comment275287> This question is about an iOS device (iPad) while the other question is about a Mac.
