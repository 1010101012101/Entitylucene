Set macvim as default application after homebrew installation <body> I've installed macvim via homebrew. This is working fine.  But when it commes to choose a default application for a new file type I cannot see MacVim. How can I set MacVim as the default application for a file type when it has been installed with homebrew?  strongNote/strong: The question is not about how to select a default application in Finder, the question is how to set an application as default which is not listed in code/Applications/code and there fore not shown by the Finder as a possible default application.  <answer61492> You can set the default app from Finder.  ol liSelect the file (e.g. foo.rb) and then choose 'Get Info' (command I, or File | Get Info)./li liOpen the 'Open with' section. /li liSelect your default app and then press 'Change All...'./li /ol  <answer61928> Try running codebrew linkapps/code. That's how you're supposed to do it, but it never works for me; if the same is true for you, do codeln -s /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-64/MacVim.app /Applications/code (substituting the actual location of the app, if it differs on your system).  Homebrew should have told you that when you installed MacVim.  <answer64033> I had the same issue. I moved MacVim.app to /Applications and then symlinked into the homebrew cellar directory.  precodemv /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-65/MacVim.app /Applications/   ln -s /Applications/MacVim.app /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-65/ /code/pre  <answer73370> strongCorrection:/strong This is no longer the case, see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/8699  Note that codebrew linkapps/code puts links in code~/Applications/code, not code/Applications/code. I had to follow the symlink (select your home directory from Favorites, select the codeApplications/code icon in the main pane, and click codeOpen/code), then pull down the path list-box near the top of the dialog box (or hit Command+Up) to go one level back up the physical path.  Then you can see the icon for the actual code.app/code folder.  <comment71100> That's just an other way of getting the same problem. Since MacVim has been installed using homebrew it's never listed in the list of applications. This is also true if I choose to see the atlernative list of applications. <comment71553> Thanks for the answer. brew links did not help. I can see MacVim in the Launchpad and can open a file in finder now, but it's still not listed in the list of applications when I want it to set as the default application for .txt (or other file types). Adding the link doesn't work either. MacVim does get listed now, but when I choose MacVim finder grays out the open button. Somme how it's not sufficient to just sym link the MacVim.app. <comment74090> Possibly relevant: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7726/why-cant-i-use-app-bundles-symlinked-into-applications-as-default-in-the-ope <comment97355> Doesn't this need to be repeated each time MacVim is upgraded? <comment129829> Worked for me. But mine was 7.3-66 which highlights @EricHu's concern... It suggests there is a better solution <comment174910> It works for me! The open button works too. My brew version is  0.9.5 <comment253667> It actually put the link in `/Applications` for me. The behavior must have changed. <comment359655> I made easier without moving - only link: `ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/8.0-130/MacVim.app/ /Applications/MacVim.app` - but yes looks like link must be upgraded after changing the version of installed MacVim - because the path to the source folder will be changed.
