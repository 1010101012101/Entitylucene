ssh -X without/with using xquartz <body> I would like to know if OSX supports codessh -X/code right out of the box?  Using the command launches XQuartz and interestingly both are NOT working:  e.g. displaying codepdf/code files returning :  precodeevince foo.pdf   ** (evince:1341): WARNING **: Command line `dbus-launch --autolaunch=58045ffa2d1f3dc82398e1eb00000008 --binary-syntax --close-stderr' exited with non-zero exit status 1: EOF in dbus-launch reading address from bus daemon\n Failed to get bus connection: Command line `dbus-launch --autolaunch=58045ffa2d1f3dc82398e1eb00000008 --binary-syntax --close-stderr' exited with non-zero exit status 1: EOF in dbus-launch reading address from bus daemon\n /code/pre  <answer218905> The '-X' parameter to ssh instructs ssh to open an XWindow session, which is why xquartz is launched automatically.  You can ssh to a remote server without -X and interact with it on a command line, however, to forward the XWindow display needs XQuartz.  To debug the problem you are seeing you may want to:  ol liEnsure there are no errors when you connect to the server (i.e. 'X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0')/li liTest other X window commands after you establish a valid connection (like xeyes or gvim)/li liCheck the value of $DISPLAY./li /ol  <comment264736> This looks like a [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info), so can you describe in more details which problem you are trying to solve here (without already making assumptions about the cause)?
