Corrupt Photos Libray when migrating to new Photos.app <body> I've downloaded the new Photos.app and migrated my iPhoto Library and now all my full screen images are replaced by a grey exclamation mark.  This is being logged in the console :  precode14/04/2015 22:48:04,002 Photos[1373]: Unsupported item: IMG_0694.JPG of type 0` 14/04/2015 22:48:04,029 Photos[1373]: Unknown version type: RDVersion(0x600003530860) modelId=23946 uuid=134LStKnROWcZ51vzo+yGg tableName=RKVersion state=persisted,readonly,local, IMG_0694.JPG 0 /code/pre  Does someone as any idea how to fix this ?  If I explore the package of my Library the Masters folder contains all my files.  <answer180931> Since Photos is so new, it may be tricky to find solutions to issues.  However, applying iPhoto type fixes may help.    Before beginning and repair, make sure you have a backup of your entire Photos/iPhoto library.    ol liYou can try closing Photos, then open Photos while pressing Command and Option.  This brings up a window for repairing issues.  Select the Repair option to start rebuilding the library.  These instructions can also be found HERE on Apple's website./li liUnfortunately, the wonderful app, iPhoto Library Manager doesn't support Photos.app, but they are creating a new app that does, call PowerPhotos!  Hopefully it'll be released soon.  Until then, we must rely on Apples built in repair functions.  /li /ol  <comment215294> Thanks, I already tried to repair the library without success, I guess I'll have to wait for PowerPhotos then
