Mac OS X (10.9) and 8192 bit certificates - Error -67762 <body> I've only recently upgraded to Mavericks and hence I'm not entirely sure whether this is a Mavericks only problem or not, but here it is:  Security update 2006-007 apparently broke 8192-bit certificates on OS X and no one bothered to fix it (https://discussions.apple.com/message/3650856#3650856). However there is (or rather used to be) a solution for this bug (or feature?) and it is in https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2668985 You've just got to execute  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.crypto RSAMaxKeySize -int 8192 /code/pre  in a Terminal prompt. Well I did, then I also restarted my macbook. However this had no effect other than setting the RSAMaxKeySize. Here is how I know the defaults command worked:  precodeingenious@book ~  $ sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.crypto  RSAMaxKeySize 8192 /code/pre  However trying to import a (valid!) 8192-bit self-signed certificate into my system keychain (using Keychain Access) I keep getting the following error:  precodeError: -67762 /code/pre  So, can anyone confirm this in 10.8.*? Is there any alternative way to make 8192-bit certificates work on OS X?  Edit: Could this thing actually be related to the new openssl in 10.9?

So what you need to run is  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security RSAMaxKeySize -int 8192 /code/pre  <comment130968> that certainly did the trick, thanks for answering :) <comment130992> You're welcome. I’m always not quite sure whether I should “steal” other people’s solutions. I don’t even own a mac and only discovered this question because shizmob linked to it in his blog post (but didn't answer it). But if my post actually helped you solve your problem, I guess I did good ^^.
