Can't see Apple_HFS partition after using Minitool Partition Wizard <body> I tried to reduce my partition size using Minitool Partition Wizard on my BOOTCAMP partition (I didn't touch Apple_HFS partition) now I can't see my Apple_HFS partition in Disk Utility.   However this partition works under bootcamp.   I think boot manager is broken. But I am not sure how can I repair while I can't see the partition.  Edit: as requested I've executed the following commands   precodereadmbr  -t readgpt  -t  /code/pre  results are   precodeSelected \\.\PhysicalDrive0 to read from. Disk ID is 028A47A7.

The six partitions are listed in the order found on the drive.  ol li~200 MB EFI partition (Usually hidden from the user)/li li~100 GB Windows partition/li li~75 GB OS X partition/li li~50 GB Windows partition/li li~650 MB OS X recovery partition (This is exactly the correct size)/li li~900 MB Windows partition/li /ol  This is anything like what one would expect to see.  h2How to Fix Your Problem/h2  From our posts and comments, it would appear the GUIDs for partitions 2 and 3 have been reversed. (The GUIDs identify the partition types. See this site for specific types.) The third party tool that I use to fix these types of problems is codegdisk/code. You can download the zip file codegdisk-windows-1.0.1.zip/code from this site.  Below are a the entries to codegdisk32.exe/code that I made on a simulation of your disk. You should copy these entries.  precodeC:\Users\david\Desktop&gt;gdisk32 \\.\PhysicalDrive0 GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Partition table scan:   MBR: protective   BSD: not present   APM: not present   GPT: present  Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.  Command (? for help): t Partition number (1-6): 2 Current type is 'Microsoft basic data' Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 700): af00 Changed type of partition to 'Apple HFS/HFS+'  Command (? for help): t Partition number (1-6): 3 Current type is 'Apple HFS/HFS+' Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 700): 0700 Changed type of partition to 'Microsoft basic data'  Command (? for help): w  Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING PARTITIONS!!  Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to \\.\PhysicalDrive0. Disk synchronization succeeded! The computer should now use the new partition table. The operation has completed successfully.  C:\Users\david\Desktop&gt; /code/pre  Your Apple_HFS partition should now appear in the Disk Utility.     Note: For other readers, the commands used to dump the partition tables came from this site. The commands have to be executed in an "Administrator: Command Prompt" window.    To open the Command Prompt window as an Administrator using Windows 10, right click on the Start Menu icon and select "Command Prompt (Admin)".

It simply doesn't understand how it's being fooled into believing it's in charge. <comment293453> It is kinda too late for your golden rule ahah <comment293455> So you can still boot to OS X? <comment293456> No I can boot windows and os x partition files are works properly under windows however it doesn't boot <comment293469> @Rodrane: How large is the Boot Camp volume and how large is the OS X volume? Also, do you have any other volumes visible on your computer. Also, what is the year/model of your Mac. <comment293480> @DavidAnderson bootcamp is 70gb now and os x is 100 gb but I reduced I created third partition and it is 45gb.  macbook pro 2013 with 240 gb ssd(I bought it lately) <comment293516> @Rodrane: I updated my answer. Sorry that my previous post disappeared. Sometimes that just happens. <comment293610> wow wow wow you are absolutely life saver!
