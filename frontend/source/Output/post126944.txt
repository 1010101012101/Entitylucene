What is the Home Folder under /Library/Java for? <body> I installed Java 1.7 from the oracle site.  Looking at my folder structure, there is code/System/Library/Java/code and code/Library/Java/code.  Under code/Library/Java/code there is a codeHome/code symlink that goes to code/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/code.  I had to point my IDE (IntelliJ) to code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home/code which is a little weird in that there is a codeHome/code directory, but that codeHome/code is not the same codeHome/code as is in codeLibrary/Java/code.  Did I mess something up in my install? Is this symlinked codeHome/code gonna mess me up at some point?   The symlinked codeHome/code goes to Java 1.6 (which is what I believe Mavericks ships with?), but I have access to 1.7.  <answer126975> No you didn't mess anything up.  My Java 7 is in the same location as yours.  The Home symlink will not mess you up.  BTW you can add this to your .bash_profile to set your java home environment variable  precodeexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v1.7 2&gt;/dev/null` /code/pre  <comment148762> Why output the std_error to null?
