Power button to sleep Mac mini on macOS Sierra? <body> After updating to macOS Sierra, I can't sleep my Mac mini holding power key. Anyone have an idea of what might be the cause? With the keyboard shortcut kbdControl/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdEject/kbd it works.  [edit] I've seen the question How can I re-enable the (display) sleep shortcut on macOS Sierra?, but in that case the problem was the sleep keyboard shortcut. Instead my problem is using the power button, and I have not found a solution in that answer.
