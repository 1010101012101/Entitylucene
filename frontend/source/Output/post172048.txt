"Select CD-ROM Boot Type:" error during Windows install <body> Which version of bootcamp 4.x do I need to install Windows 7 (64 bit) on an iMac7,1 with Yosemite?  Specs: 64 bit Core 2 Duo, 4GB, 16GB Flash, optical drive, Windows 7 install DVD  Everything goes fine until during the install process Mac reboots to install windows then:   1br 2br Select CD Rom boot type:  I can't enter anything because keyboard and mouse are unresponsive and I assume the correct drivers were not loaded.  iMac is mid 2007 24" 64 bit (says profiler/other internal monitors).  Have downloaded various boot camp versions, followed documented instructions, stood on my head and spit nickels, and still get same error (Select CD Boot ROM type).  Made ISO file with Mac Disk Utility (create and change .cdr to .iso)  Didn't work either.   After further review, seems that I misread Apple support table which show this model uses Boot Camp 4 for 32-bit Windows 7.  Genius - bought install DVD for 64-bit :-o  So I guess that's why it won't install.  Going to try suggested method of creating ISO from W7 store-bought DVD on Windows machine just for giggles and see what happens.  Then probably go buy the correct DVD for 32-bit  :-(  Thanks for the info :-)  <answer172128> The problem you encountered occured before the Boot Camp drivers are installed. So, the drivers are not the problem. The correct drivers for Macs can be found at Boot Camp: System requirements for Microsoft Windows operating systems. In your case, the drivers can be downloaded from Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. Also, the drivers can be downloaded using the Boot Camp Assistant. By the way, I used the same drivers to do a clean install Windows 8 (64 bit) on my iMac7,1 (20-inch, Mid 2007).  Your actual problem is with the DVD itself. As you might guess, it came with two ways to boot. You need to remove one of them. You are using a Windows 7 DVD. I was having the same problem with a Windows 8.1 (64 bit) DVD. The procedure to repair should be the same.   I used a windows 8.1 machine and a copy of the program oscdimg.exe from Microsoft. The procedure should work just as well using a Windows 7 machine. Also, the machine needs a working DVD drive.   To begin, you will need to copy oscdimg.exe to your desktop. There are many web sites where a copy of this file can be found. I used oscdimg.exe Version 2.55 (x86). If you want to be sure you are using the same one I used, follow the steps below.   ol liGo to the web site The Windows® Automated Installation Kit (AIK) for Windows® 7 and download the iso. This iso file is 1.7 GB in length./li liOpen the file Neutral.cab. If you are using a Windows 7 machine, you will need to burn the iso on to a DVD. The instructions can be found here. Open the new DVD to find the Neutral.cab file. It is faster to copy the Neutral.cab file to the desktop before opening it. If you are using a Windows 8.1 machine, right click on the iso icon and select Mount. Neutral.cab will be one of the files in the opened folder. (Note: Opening the file can take a while.)  One way to avoid burning a DVD would be to copy (or download) the iso file to a machine running OS X. The iso file can then be mounted by double clicking on its icon. Neutral.cab will be one of the files in the opened folder. You will need to copy Neutral.cab back to a Window machine. I tested this using OS X 10.6.8. I assume this procedure would work using any newer version of OS X. /li liUsing a Windows 7 or 8.1 machine, extract oscdimg.exe from the Neutral.cab cabinet file. The x86 (32 bit) version is named F1_oscdimg. The x64 (64 bit) version is named F3_oscdimg. Right click on the file of your choice and select Extract. Place the extracted file on your desktop. Rename the extracted file to oscdimg.exe. (I did verify the correctness of this procedure by installing the entire package and binary file comparing the installed x86 and x64 oscdimg files with F1_oscdimg and F3_oscdimg, respectively.)/li /ol  Next, make a new Windows 7 installation DVD, follow these steps. The procedure was tested using a Windows 8.1 installation DVD.  ol liMake sure a copy of oscdimg.exe is on your desktop./li liPlace the original Window 7 installation DVD in the optical drive.  /li liIf you are using a Windows 7 machine, open a Command Prompt window by clicking the Start button img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8poVR.png" alt="Start button", clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, and then clicking Command Prompt. On a Windows 8.1 machine, look for the Command Prompt icon on the Apps page./li liChange your working directory to the desktop by entering the following command in the Command Prompt Window.  precodecd  %homepath%\desktop /code/pre/li liAssuming D: is your DVD drive, enter the following command. Be sure to replace the letter before each : with the drive letter of your DVD drive. The file codenew.iso/code will be created on your desktop.  precodeoscdimg  -n  -m  -bD:\boot\etfsboot.com  D:\  new.iso /code/pre  Using this command, on a Windows 8.1 (64 bit) DVD, produced the following output.  precodeC:\Users\David\Desktop&gt;oscdimg -n -m -bD:\boot\etfsboot.com D:\ new.iso  OSCDIMG 2.55 CD-ROM and DVD-ROM Premastering Utility Copyright (C) Microsoft, 1993-2007.

I used the 64 bit disk and got the select CD-ROM boot type message and my keyboard/mouse was non responsive. I powered off my Mac and then ejected the disk and put in the 32 bit Windows install disk instead and the installation continued like nothing was ever wrong. So the issue in my case was that the installation for Boot Camp needed the 32 bit version of Windows 7 not 64 bit. I hope this helps someone else also. :)  <answer231044> ol liAfter selecting CD as boot device, immediately press "1" on your keyboard and keep it pressed./li liWhen you see a black flash, press enter (without releasing "1").

I still think the question could need some improvements though, so if you can help out the OP with the text here it would be great. <comment202643> I first tried (this morning) using the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool, to burn the DVD. It made no difference. Besides the tool was difficult to install on my Windows 8.1 machine. You can not install from a flash drive. Your firmware does not support this. I did run Window 7 (64 bit) years ago on my iMac7,1 so I know it works. <comment205051> Appreciate your excellent assistance.  Win7 installed, however  Boot camp drivers (both 4.0.4033 and 4.0.255) will not install. (64 bit not supported)  If you would kindly post your afore mentioned solution it would be most helpful.  Thanks <comment205138> @dazednconfused: The answer to your (64 bit not supported) question has been posted [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/174221/using-boot-camp-support-software-4-0-4033-to-install-64-bit-windows-7-or-8). Let me know, if you need further help. <comment205196> If you choose to install a 64 bit version of Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, you will encounter problems installing the drivers. A fix for this can be found at [Using Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 to install 64 bit Windows 7 or 8](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/174221/using-boot-camp-support-software-4-0-4033-to-install-64-bit-windows-7-or-8). <comment207488> Thanks for your invaluable assistance.  Win7 up and running on iMac7,1 with BootCamp4033 drivers.  You have provided me with better assistance than the Apple or Microsoft support sites.  Much appreciated.
