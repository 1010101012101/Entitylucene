install NTFS system checks? <body> I have a external hard drive and I'm checking it with the codeDisk Utility/code. However, it gave me an error says   precode** No NTFS file system checks have been implemented yet. /code/pre  How can I install one?  <answer104075> OS X supports the option to read NTFS-formatted drives, but has not supported writing to these drives. Therefore, the use of a third-party driver such as Paragon NTFS or Tuxera NTFS has been required for those seeking full NTFS support; however, OS X does support writing to NTFS, but this feature is just not enabled by default.  ol liEnable NTFS option via Terminal em(I am not going to document this, as I highly do not recommend using this option at all, unless you are aware of the problems this will lead to)/em/li liDownload and install SL-NTFS which is an NFTS writing preference for your Mac. Works on Mac OS X 10.6+ strong(FREE)/strong/li liInstall NTFS-3G, though this is not my favourite option. It's a little slow and can cause compatibility issues with anything after Mac OS X 10.6. Some users report it working flawlessly. I personally think it's write capability is a little slow. Touch and go. strong(FREE)/strong/li liParagon NTFS which is approx strong$20/strong, is the entry-level of paid software version. I have used this for quite a while and never had a problem. Works on anything from Mac OS X strong10.6.x/strong â†’ strong10.8.x/strong/li liTuxera NTFS costs approx strong$32/strong and does everything that Paragon NTFS does. I use this one now, because it built upon the NTFS-3G option I mentioned earlier. I personally believe it works the best as I have never had an issue with it to date, but then I have used all options (emaside #2/em) and found no issues with any of them./li /ol  To solve your enquiry, either NTFS-3G, Paragon or Tuxera will all enable you to use Disk Utility to check the drive, format the drive, etc etc. The picture below is from my system.  strongNOTE:/strong I am not saying SL-NTFS will not do what you want, I just have not tested it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aSLW5.png" alt="enter image description here"
