GCC 5.X integration on Xcode 6 <body> I need to use/integrate GCC 5.X (in my case 5.3, and it is already installed) on Xcode 6.2.  I've found a lot of outdated tutorials about GCC 4.X and Xcode 5 (or lower), but all of them are outdated and do not work anymore.  I've also found this tutorial, but I have not the 5.3.xcplugin file that the tuto recommend to copy.  I am still on Mac OS X Maverick, and I can install Xcode 7 if necessary.  Anybody would know how to do it?  <comment292291> As an aside I can only see wanting gcc for C++ issues if so Xcode is not that good an IDE for C++ and I would look for something else <comment292293> @Mark Any recommandation? <comment292294> Unfortunately not they all seem to lack something :)  Eclipse is OK its problem is not having the llvm debugger <comment292312> Ouch... I was using Eclipse for Java before, and I fed up about it. If it is ok for C++, I may use it, the absence of debugger is ok. <comment292316> The debugger will be in Eclipse for gcc it is not there for llvm based code
