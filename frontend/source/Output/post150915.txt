Can I just copy an application from a MAC and paste it to another MAC? <body> As the title suggest, can I just copy and paste an application to my new MAC instead of downloading them all over again? Or is there another way to do this?  <answer150916> Most applications downloaded from the Mac App Store are transferable to another Mac, either by network or removable media (USB, etc).  You can copy the applications to your new Mac.  <answer150925> Try the migration assistant first.  It will move everything you need from your old mac. (OS 10.6.8 or later)    Many applications have data in the /Library/Application Support folder or the ~/Library/Application Support folder as well as prefeferences and other scattered support files that would all need to be moved.    <comment177604> Okay mate, I'll try it first and see if it worked. Thanks :) <comment177609> This is very true.
