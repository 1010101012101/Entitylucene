iPhone: How to prevent maximum screen brightness when charging? <body> I've set my screen brightness to about 50%. This works fine for me, except that the setting seems to be ignored when it's charging: then it's 100%. I've got a desktop charging stand on my bedside table, and this is exactly the place where I don't need maximum brightness!  strongHow can I make my iPhone respect the brightness setting even when charging?/strong  This is an iPhone 4 (iOS 4.1) but I noticed the same with the iPhone 3G (iOS 3.1.3).   <answer3758> I can't seem to reproduce this issue. Is it possible that ambient light is increasing the brightness? Does it still go to 100% brightness if you turn off Auto-Brightness?  <answer3771> Can't fix it -- currently.  Based on postings so far, strongthis is a bug in iOS 4.1/strong (less prominent/problematic in 3.x versions).   The only solution would be to upgrade to a newer version strongwhen/strong that becomes available strongif/strong this bug has been fixed in that version.  <answer4276> Upgrade to iOS 4.2. It fixes both the charging brightness and the locked screen brightness bugs. I just tried it and it works.   <comment3530> There is no ambient light :-) but I will turn off autobrightness and test tonight. <comment3533> When Auto-Brightness is off, then the brightness is always as specified and not more. When Auto-Brightness is on, then it's much brighter but ONLY at the lock screen -- it dims down to ambient level once I slide to unlock. Is this a bug in iOS? <comment3550> @torben: I noticed the same thing, and it's very annoying that the lock screen is so bright, especially in a dark room. It only started happening in OS 4.x. I'm hoping it's a bug and not a feature...
