How to Create New File in Selected Folder Using LaunchBar? <body> Using Launchbar, I'd like to be able to do the following:  Navigate around by normal means in Launchbar  Once I'm in desired folder, I'd like to be able to run a command/action that asks me to enter a filename and then the command proceeds to ´touch´ (filename) in that directory.  How can this be achieved, any existing solutions?  <answer113888> This can be done by using the "New Text Document Here" action  Select folder - tab - start typing "New" - select "New Text Document Here" - type name - enter.  If you're looking for a more complete solution that can create any type of file (including ones without the .txt extension that the New Text Document action forces) try this Applescript. Just put it in a file named codeNew File.applescript/code in the code~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions//code directory:  precodeon handle_string(dir)     display dialog "Enter filename:" default answer ""     set fname to text returned of result     set fullpath to dir &amp; fname     try         do shell script "touch '" &amp; fullpath &amp; "'"         open location "x-launchbar:select?file=" &amp; fullpath     on error errMsg         display dialog "Error: " &amp; errMsg         open location "x-launchbar:hide"     end try end handle_string /code/pre  It'll touch the file, then select it in LaunchBar upon completion (you can comment out the line that does that by adding code--/code to the beginning of the line or just removing it).  <answer127054> A custom script as in Justin's answer is the way to go if you need this to be Terminal-free, but if not I'd do it this way:  ol liSelect folder via LaunchBar/li licmd-T (open Terminal there)/li liType "touch whateverfile", return/li licmd-W (close Terminal window)/li liInvoke LaunchBar, cmd-R, return (to get back to the app you were in)/li /ol  <comment119881> You need to be clearer. What file type you want to create? <comment119983> @Buscar웃 I want to create a blank new file a la `touch blankfile`. Typical use would be e.g. when developing websites and you quickly need to touch/create new files. (I'm thinking that it would also be nice if one could name the new file when creating it, via LaunchBar's text input field – but that's not crucial.) <comment192673> Copied as it is, I couldn't get this working on OS X 10.9.5, LB 6.1.6. I had to change line 4 to `set full_path to dir & "/" & file_name` and line 6 to `do shell script "touch " & full_path`. <comment195369> Works as is on OS X 10.10.1 and LB 6.1.6.
