Location information is not shown in "Years" view of Photos App <body> I do not see the location information of the pictures I have taken in 2014 when I am in "strongYears/strong" view.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ETNz.png" alt="Years view"  I am sure pictures have GPS information on them. If I go in to strong2014/strong year, I can see that pictures have location information.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ncmmL.png" alt="2014 view"  Has anyone had this problem?  Notes:  ul liThis has been going on since iOS 7 and I started using iOS 7 when it was beta./li liIt is not that I have been to many places in 2014. In that case it should have said "United States, Canada &amp; 4 more" (something like that)/li liI called apple support but they couldn't help./li liI have the same problem on both iOS Photos app and Mac Photos app. For this reason, I have sent Mac Photos app diagnostic information to apple as a bug report but no luck there either./li liI have reset and restored my phone, and iCloud pictures and no luck./li liI have iCloud Photo Library on./li /ul  <answer226193> Yes, you are not alone. I've been having the same problem, started mid-way through 2014. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but wish I had.  I've also gone through multiple rounds with Apple Support only for them to repeatedly tell me that I have no GPS data in 2014 pictures, despite the fact that the vast majority do have GPS data.  A few months ago the same thing happened to me with 2015, lost location information in 'Years' view. I realised this was related to importing a series of photos from my GoPro, and after deleting them all from my library, adjusting GPS EXIF data and re-importing (this was before Photos for Mac supported editing GPS data directly), the issue went away.  I suspect the issue is down to a selection of images that do not have GPS data / have invalid GPS data, causing something in Photos to barf.  Reading https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7174772?start=0&amp;tstart=0 has led me to believe that it may be possible to create a smart album for all photos in 2014 that do not have GPS data. If so, then it can lead to one or more of the following options:  ol liExport all untagged images, re-importing one at a time and identifying which image causes the library to stop summarising for the year/li liIdentify a tipping point, if it's over a certain % of untagged images that causes the library to stop summarising for the year/li liManually tag all the untagged images, where relevant, if it's a % issue./li liDelete some images./li /ol  Sorry I don't have anything more helpful to report, but at least you know you're not alone! :-)  If you do make any progress on any of the above, please to share. I will also share if and when I'm able to identify anything further.  Good luck!  <comment274654> Thanks for the reply. No luck on my side. Still... <comment311474> I have gotten in touch with apple support (Emma Andersson | Senior Technical Advisor). She sounded very professional and listened my problem very carefully. She has advised me to reset my phone (even though I had tried it before). She told me she will get in touch with me but I have not heard anything from her. She doesn't reply my emails. I feel like it was just a waste of time and this is not how I know Apple.
