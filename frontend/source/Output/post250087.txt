Apple dev license expired - Renew(paying) or else? <body> My paid apple dev license expired a year ago. In the meanwhile Xcode 7 came out with the option of testing locally on iOS devices without the need of a paid license.  I am now developing a Unity game that targets iOS devices. I build for iOS and open the Xcode project that returns this error:     No code signing identities found: No valid signing identities (i.e.   certificate and private key pair) were found.   I then suppose I would need to create certificates and related stuff, but if I access the apple dev portal I am presented with this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xbJ90.png" alt="enter image description here"  What should I do at this stage to be able to test o local devices without paying?  <answer250284> I didn't know this one.. but it depends on the features you want to test!   For some features you are required to have an Apple ID like Apple Pay.  Supported capabilities for developing on your device  <comment310402> I've edited out the side question - renewing membership means you pay for another year of Apple-signed certificates. When you follow http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/226338/how-to-compile-an-app-on-xcode-without-developer-account - do you see free listed for your Apple ID? Does changing the bundle of the app that was signed help to get you a free certificate? <comment310411> I see free listed on my apple id. I changed the bundle. I really don't know how to test it in my iPhone now though....
