Can automator create symlinks but skip existing files? <body> Today I discovered the awesome Create Symlinks action from JuneCloud.  It works great, but creates duplicate files (appending a number to each one) for any symlink that already exists in the final location.  I want it to just ignore those files and keep on trucking.  I tried using a shell script codeln -s/code but that just plain fails with a codeThe action “Run Shell Script” encountered an error./code message after hitting a file that already exists.  Is there a way to create a symlink but SKIP existing files?  I know I can us code-f/code to overwrite but I'd rather just skip.  How can this be done either in Automator or shell script?  <answer281176> Yes! You can do it easily in the shell script. The code-h/code flag fits the bill, as described (sort of) on the ln man page. So instead of doing codeln -s/code, do codeln -sh/code.  Here's an example. Say you wanted to make a symbolic link of each of your downloads, which would exist on your Desktop, but you already have some symbolic links there. Then you could do this:  precodecd Downloads for f in *; do ln -sh ~/Downloads/"$f" ~/Desktop; done; /code/pre  For any files that you have that you already have symbolic links for, the command will print out:  precode    ln: /Users/******/Desktop/FlashPlayer.dmg: File exists /code/pre  The command does this printing after running so it does not throw any errors nor require any additional inputs.  <comment353786> OHH!  Well damn.  I read the man (believe it or not!  lol) but where it says that -h causes ln to "not follow" the link if it exists, I didn't take that to mean "skip and keep going".  Unfortunately it's not working, Automator still barfs because "file exists".  =( <comment353787> @JonathanvanClute Yeah it's confusing <comment353792> Any idea why Automator still doesn't like it? <comment353793> I don't know, except you might want to try running the script by itself (w/o Automator) and making sure it works like that. <comment353795> Unfortunately I'm specifically passing a list of files into the script, which is why I'm using automator in the first place.  I know slightly more than nothing about shell scripting so building the entire thing myself that way is out of the question.  I'd love to avoid shell entirely if I could but it seems Automator is strangely lacking in certain areas. <comment353804> Holy crap I fixed it!  Thanks to this web page:  http://tewha.net/2012/07/make-a-symbolic-link-from-finder/ - I happened to notice a small detail in their version of the ln script - a `shift;` after the ln command.  Just for the hell of it I put it in and voila - no errors at all, and the script performs exactly as I had hoped it would.  Eureka!  =)
