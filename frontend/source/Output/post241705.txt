How to Rescue OS X without Visible Startup Disc? <body> I need to delete refind but I cannot do it because I bypass it, since I cannot see visible startup disc.  I stopped partition process where I tried to erase Linux partition because of infinite time in the process.  There are no directories code/etc/refind.d//code and code/boot/efi/EFI/refind/code in my system. I am now in Recovery Mode where you cannot see the startup disk in codeStartup Disk/code.  The problem with coderefind/code is that it shows at startup just the Linux partition which is broken. If I click it, the thing goes to codegrub&gt;/code where I already did this based on the thread  precodegrub rescue &gt; ls (hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos3) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1,msdos1) grub rescue &gt; ls (hd0,msdos1) # try to recognize which partition is this grub rescue &gt; ls (hd0,msdos2) # let's assume this is the linux partition grub rescue &gt; set root=(hd0,msdos2) grub rescue &gt; set prefix=(hd0,msdos2)/boot/grub # or wherever grub is installed grub rescue &gt; insmod normal # if this produced an error, reset root and prefix to something else .. grub rescue &gt; normal /code/pre  where I selected the HSF+ disk for the boot. The problem is that this will not bypass coderefind/code.   hr  How can rescue OS X without visible Startup disk and with refind?  <answer243521> My solution was to delete OS X because I did not get help enough fast. I needed my computer. Klanomath's proposal seems to be forward  ol liBoot to Recovery Mode please /li liDo codediskutil list/code /li liDo codegpt -r show disk0/code in Terminal.app/li liAdd output/screenshot here/li /ol  <comment299894> yeah I got that. But better remove your (accepted) answer because it's no viable solution to the problem... <comment299895> @klanomath I just want to get an answer to this thread so I know that I do not have the problem now. I will otherwise regularly read it.
