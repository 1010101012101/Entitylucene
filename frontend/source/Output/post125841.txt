Boot Camp Assistant can't be used since disk is not journaled even though it is <body> I'm trying to install Win7 onto my mid-2010 iMac using Bootcamp. After starting Bootcamp I click "Continue" and get this message:     Boot Camp Assistant cannot be used.      The disk is not journaled. You must enable journaling using Disk Utility before using the Boot Camp Assistant.   However when I Get Info on my HD, under "Format" it reads:     Mac OS Extended (Journaled)   If my HD is journaled then why is Boot Camp stopping me from going along with the partitioning and then install of Win7?  System: iMac, 8 GB RAM, OS X 10.9.2, 3.6 GHz i5 CPU, 1 TB HDD  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CITfO.jpg" alt="Screenshot"
