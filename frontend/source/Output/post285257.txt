Saving my all iMessage conversations to Windows 10 <body> I need to save my iMessage conversations as they are, because I'm afraid all the updated dialogue will be erased as soon a I restore my iPod from a previous backup.  The restoring of the iPod will happen, I just don't want to lose any dialogue from this very second until the last time I backed up my iPod. The conversation is very long and very important to me, and I need to keep all of it.  I am not looking to add an unknown, potentially hazardous software of program.  Any help will be greatly appreciate. Thank you for you time and attention.      <answer285261> I use iExplorer, which is available for macOS and for Windows. Among other highly useful things, it can export the contents of Messages, including images. It it not a free app, but I've used it so many times that it has paid for itself (US$39.99) many times over.  emDisclaimer/em: Satisfied user - not affiliated in any way with Macroplant LLC.  <comment359799> Thank you very much for your speedy response.  It looks like I'll have to bit the proverbial bullet and pay for a third party program.  Thank you again IconDaemon.
