How to use Ctrl+left/Ctrl+Right (instead of Alt+left/Alt+right) to move to the previous/next word <body> On a Mavericks system, I would like to use Ctrl+left/Ctrl+right instead of Alt+left/Alt+right to move to the next word or the previous word.  Mission Control is not using Ctrl+left/Ctrl+right (I changed that from the default value).  Is it possible to do this with some system setting (i.e. without a keymapper)?    <answer115804> You can use strongKeyRemap4MacBook/strong with a private.xml such as this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;⌃← &amp; ⌃→ to ⌥← &amp; ⌥→&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;remapCtrlLeftAndCtrlRightToAltLeftAndAltRight&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__       KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE,       KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L     &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__       KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE,       KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  I'm not aware of any System Preferences setting regarding this.  hr  With regard to comment, change the contents of the &lt;autogen to…  precode__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L /code/pre    precode__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L /code/pre  <answer115853> Another option is to create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{    "^\UF700" = moveWordUp:;    "^\UF701" = moveWordDown:;    "^\UF702" = moveWordLeft:;    "^\UF703" = moveWordRight:;    "^$\UF700" = moveWordUpAndModifySelection:;    "^$\UF701" = moveWordDownAndModifySelection:;    "^$\UF702" = moveWordLeftAndModifySelection:;    "^$\UF703" = moveWordRightAndModifySelection:; } /code/pre  Quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.

Just a quick mention that I actually needed Alt-Left and Alt-Right to Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right, so I guess that simply swapping the KeyCode:: lines should do the trick. <comment135533> @Pep Not quite as easy as swapping the entire line, just the second parameter of each — see edit. <comment143760> I like this solution because it does not require any additional software, and instead relies on Apple's built-in functionality. I also added `"^\U007F" = deleteWordBackward:;` to map ctrl+backspace to delete word.
