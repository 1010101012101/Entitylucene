App Store says an app is installed, but it isn't <body> I've installed a new primary SSD drive on my mac, now I'm trying to download a few apps that I've already installed on my previous HD, but app store keeps saying they're already installed. But they are not.  Is there a way to tell Apple's App Store that these apps are not installed?  I've already tried the solution on the thread: App Store thinks apps are installed, but no success.  My old HD is still connected to my MBP, but as slave.

You have a couple of options:  ul liDelete the Mac App Store apps from your external drive and then re-download the apps to your new SSD./li liDrop the apps from your external hard drive onto your new SSD, placing them in the Applications folder./li /ul  <answer84465> Just fixed it.
