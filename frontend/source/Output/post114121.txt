How to test memory after memory upgrade? <body> I recently upgraded my macbook from 4G to 8G and wonder if there's a tool to test the quality of new memory. I found codememtest/code 4.22 seems only test about 1G:  precode$ memtest all 2  Memtest version 4.22 (64-bit) Copyright (C) 2004 Charles Cazabon Copyright (C) 2004-2008 Tony Scaminaci (Macintosh port) Licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 only  Mac OS X 10.9 (13A603) running in multiuser mode Memory Page Size: 4096 System has 4 Intel core(s) with SSE Requested memory: 1048MB (1099390976 bytes) Available memory: 1048MB (1099390976 bytes) Allocated memory: 1048MB (1099390976 bytes) at local address 0x0000000101000000 Attempting memory lock... locked successfully Partitioning memory into 2 comparison buffers...

Works better, about 7G memory tested. So I guess the missing 1G is reserved for the graphics card?  <answer114134> I suggest you to install codememtester/code for example with codeMacPorts/code:  precode$ port install memtester /code/pre  and use it:  pre$ memtester 2G memtester version 4.3.0 (64-bit) Copyright (C) 2001-2012 Charles Cazabon.

You can try the Apple Hardware Test by pressing the 'd' key on your keyboard while booting (if it is not working, try with Alt-d to boot the AHT over the Internet). Or you can also try MemTest86 and create a bootable memory stick. I have read some people saying that MemTest86 was better than AHT. However it just happened to me that AHT was able to find a memory failure in my MBP, and MemTest86 did not detect any problem after 4 passes of tests.  <comment133828> The part of memory used, even in single user mode, is the Mac OS X kernel and its I/O buffers. <comment247687> In newer Mac laptops (post summer 2013), the Apple Hardware Test has been renamed Apple Diagnostics. Similar functionality, and you still hold 'd' at boot time to load it.
