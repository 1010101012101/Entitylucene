Improvements in iOS 7.1 for iPad 2 <body> So the whole internet is full of joy for optimization of the new 7.1 update which makes the OS much more usable on good old iPhone 4. I haven't found anything, though, concerning the iPad 2. Are there any improvements for iPad 2 as well?  <answer123917> I've read in many user comments that yes it did improve the UX on iPad 2. It's more fluid than before.   Edit : This french site confirms it.
