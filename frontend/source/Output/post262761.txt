Force a user logout after x-amount of idle time <body> Is there a reliable way to log an idle user off of Mac OS X 10.11.6 after a period of idle time. I see some information, stating launchd should be used, but none of those have information on HOW to use launchd/launchctl. I just need to log off the user, no matter what is opened in Mac OS X. Setting the built-in option to log-off a user after a period of idle time only works if there are no open programs that prompt for and exit input, like a save request. These Macs are in a public computing lab and users know not to save data to the local hard drives. Thanks
