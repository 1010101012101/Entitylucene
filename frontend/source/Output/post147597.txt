Macbook retina 2012: CPU temperature too high <body> I'm using Macbook Pro Retina Mid 2012 with CPU core i7 2.7 Ghz. I see that my computer is too hot as I think for a mac. The keyboard is hot,too.  I'm using codeiStat/code software to get detail of my mac. Here is my detail:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yT7JN.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you see, four cores are in high temperature. But as I see in codeActivity Monitor/code, they're just work at about 5% and 95% is idle. I don't know why the heating is too high. are there any problems with my mac. If not, does this problem from software ? How can I fix this. I think 2000-2200rpm is slow for this temperature. Should I increase fan's speed. Thanks :)  Thanks :)  <answer147631> There are two likely issues afoot here:  ol liYour System Management Controller has gotten some corruption./li liYou're seeing potential hardware-/sensor failures./li /ol  To reset your SMC, follow these instructions: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964  If that doesn't solve the problem, I'd run Apple Diagnostics and see whether it picks up on any hardware problems. If it does, the system should be taken to Apple or an Apple-authorized repair centre for further testing and repair.  <comment174054> thanks :) I will get a try. I meet this problem when move all data (include OS) from macbook late 2013 to macbook mid 2012. I don't know if I don't install os from fresh will meet this problem or not :) <comment174055> can you tell me. Will Apple Diagnostic always check hardware problems ? If not, what should I do next. thanks :) <comment174077> If the mid-2012 was used, it's possible that the PRAM has settings that are not compatible with your OS settings. You can reset the PRAM easily: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14222?viewlocale=en_US <comment174134> I don't really see any changes. my computer maybe will be cooler if i increaser fan's speed. do you use this software ? Because I want to see normal setting of other mac. thanks :) <comment174139> High CPU temperatures are not normal. You should have the system checked at a Genius Bar or authorized Apple repair centre.
