Pages for iOS won't let me insert or replace pictures (images) <body> When i click on the "insert stuff" button, the window pops up with the tabs that let me pick pictures, shapes, tables, etc.  If I select a table, shape, or anything but a picture, I can pick a specific one, and it appears in the doc, as it should.  But if i pick pictures, I get to pick from my albums, images, etc, but when I select one, nothing happens - the thumbnail gets darker to reflect that I clicked it, but the app just hangs - no image appears in the doc.  The same thing occurs if I use a pre-made template with a pic in it - I can click on the embedded image icon, and get to my images to pick one to select the generic one, but nothing happens when I pick one.  Any ideas?   I already tried a reset.  <answer7161> Either Pages can't read the type of image file you are trying to use, or there will be a bug fix in later update. Try holding your'e finger over the screen and moving it about, the image might be there just pulling a little trick on you.  <answer7246> Another possibility is a corrupted plist file. Quit Pages. Go to Preferences in your Library folder and delete com.apple.iWork.Pages.plist and relaunch Pages.  <comment4022> I've had this issue too. I think it has to do with file size and formats. I've circumvented this (sometimes) by going into the photos application and copying the photo I want and then pasting it into Keynote. <comment29689> Topic is Pages on iOS... <comment262958> You do know this is tagged iOS, not OS X right? Please read the question lest you do this.
