At symbol is in the wrong place on an Apple keyboard on Windows 7 <body> We have an Apple keyboard connected to Windows 7 on a Sony laptop.  The email at "@" symbol is located on the kbd2/kbd key, however when the kbdalt/kbd key and kbd2/kbd key are pressed simultaneously we don't get the "@" symbol, we get a quotation mark.  What settings need to be changed to rectify this?  <answer264495> Use kbdshift/kbd + kbd'/kbd.   At is in in quote. See onscreen keyboard. The symbols are swapped.   <comment198154> Your keyboard layout is en-UK and you need to change it to en-US. <comment198186> What happens if you press **shift** and **2** simultanesouly?  That's what I have to do to get "@".
