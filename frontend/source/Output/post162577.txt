Macbook turns on with loud fan noise <body> Whenever I try to turn on my Macbook, the fans are super loud straight away.  My battery is removed (manually because it looked like it was going to explode).  I tried to reset the SMC, but that did not work. Any help is appreciated.  <comment190137> Loud, as in they are spinning fast, or loud like there is something hitting the fan blades?  Is there excessive vibration, like a fan bearing may be bad? <comment190138> @FlyingTrashcan Loud as in spinning very fast, there is no excessive vibration, and the fans start working the second I turn the macbook on.
