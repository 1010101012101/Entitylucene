iterm - what's the key-combo to switch panes? <body> I've learned how to split my terminal windows with apple-d and apple-shift-d.  Its very useful.br How do I then switch between the two panes (see below) using the keyboard?br I know I can use the mouse but would like to know if there's a key combo to do it.  <answer114207> kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbd←/kbd/kbd↑/kbd/kbd→/kbd/kbd↓/kbd will let you navigate split panes in the direction of the arrow, i.e. when using kbd⌘/kbd+kbdD/kbd to split panes vertically, kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbd→/kbd will let you switch between the panes.  Note: kbd⌥/kbd is the [alt] key
