Selecting Random File in AppleScript <body> I’m trying to make a script that can select/display/open a file randomly from a folder and its subfolders. The following script:  precodetell application "Finder"     get some file of (folder "/Volumes/Expansion Drive/Photos") end tell /code/pre  Gives following error:  strongerror "Finder got an error: Can’t get folder \"/Volumes/Expansion Drive/Photos\"." number -1728 from folder "/Volumes/Expansion Drive/Photos”/strong  What is the correct syntax? It’s a late 2013 iMac with OS X 10.10.5.  <answer207767> Because you're using the POSIX path syntax, you have to use codePOSIX file/code to get the object at that path:  precodetell application "Finder"     get some file of (folder (POSIX file "/Volumes/Expansion Drive/Photos")) end tell /code/pre  <answer207777> Using Finder to get lists of files can be problematic as well as long winded. I'd recommend to fall back to unix tools like this...  precode# # Get list of files... #   For example: all .txt files (not folders) under Downloads and below. # try     set filelist to (do shell script "find ~/Downloads -type f -name '*.txt'") on error eStr     # Do something here...     log eStr end try  # Count the results set n to count every paragraph in filelist  # Get a random no set n to (get random number from 1 to n)  # Get the nth item from the results... get paragraph n of filelist /code/pre  <answer288969> Check out a short script (from another party) to see how you can use to rename files in an ascending order.  This way you can get a sense of how indexes work.  I made the script below that works for me.  It sets the index of the files that are in the folder.  In the folder I have each file named from file1.. file2.. file3..    The script works as follows: sets the index based on the number of files, then chooses a random number between the lowest number to the index of files and then I use the GUI with "System Events" to tell terminal to open a file with the random number.    Note: I take advantage of a wonderful tool from Terminal that with tab you can finish writing to the end of the intended file so no need to type the rest.
