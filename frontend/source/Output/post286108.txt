Text replacement not working in Office? <body> I am talking about the text replacement function under system prefs/keyboard/text.  I have added multiple replacements, but they don't work in MS Office (Word, Excel, etc). Anyone know how to fix this?  <answer286124> Word does not use apple's stuff for this, you set it up in word's own Tools  Autocorrect .  <comment360981> I am familiar with Word autocorrect, but I want Word to use the macOS text replacement. anyway to achieve this? <comment360989> No.  Same with spellcheck.
