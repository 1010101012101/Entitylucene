Can I conclude that I have to upgrade my mac's RAM based on these stats? <body> My 2012 13 inch MacBook Pro has become real slow, even when just a few programs like Itunes, Safari or Spotify are opened. I've been cleaning up my HDD, but I don't feel like it's speeding up. So I'm thinking to upgrade my 4GB RAM. The last days I did some research on how RAM is used by a mac, but I still don't know how you can conclude if your RAM is too low. According to the activity monitor the memory pressure is always in green, even if Safari is not responding for a while, and it takes a couple of minutes to load a webpage. My mean memory usage is 3GB of my physical 4GB. Then I did some tests in terminal (while running iTunes, Safari, Terminal and Activity Monitor) : I entered the vm_stat and the top command. You can see that my virtual memory VM is extremely high (500G), but my search on the internet learned me that it isn't a useful number to take a conclusion out of it. Is it correct that the more significant numbers are pageins, pageouts, swapins, swapouts? What can these numbers learn me about my RAM usage? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/76s1H.png" alt="results of vm_stat and top command"  This is what my activity monitor is giving. It's set in Dutch, but I hope you can determine what is what by it's place.

Also, can you add a screenshot from Activity Monitor showing the Memory Pressure part? <comment278553> I'm running OS X Yosemite and I have a HDD of 500GB with 70GB of free space <comment278554> Activity monitor shows virtually no swap and is green so from that your memory is OK <comment278588> As Mark said, memory doesn't seem to be the issue here. Maybe the answers in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41633/how-can-i-boost-the-performance-of-my-macbook?rq=1 will help.
