Why does my iPhone heat when charged and when in use <body> My iPhone gets really hot when charging and sometimes when I use it. I thought it might do this because my iPhone is cracked and I've thought about getting the screen fixed but I'm not sure if that's the reason why it's hot. I have also stopped using, I haven't used it for a few weeks now but it still heats up when I charge it. What can I do to resolve this problem?   <answer98618> This strongIS/strong normal and happens to my iPhone all the time. emHowever/em you might want to take it to the apple store to check if there is a problem. If there strongIS/strong a problem on strongsoftware/strong then Apple will replace your iPhine.  <answer98621> h21. Bad Connection/h2  In areas with poor or reduced connectivity, iPhone has to expend more time searching for and maintaining network connections. This in turn uses more energy which causes the battery to heat up.  strongPossible Solution/strong  You can try turning codeAirplane Mode/code on and see if you have the same problem with heating up.  I also have an iPhone and I myself notice that it does not heat up if I am out in the open, but it heats up and drains the battery if I am in the basement of a large concrete building.  h22. Case?/h2  If you have a case for your iPhone, you should expect that it heats up. The case, while it does protect your phone, also blocks some air from coming out and consequently causes the hot air to be trapped inside the phone. This will cause your iPhone to heat up almost indefinitely.  strongPossible Solution/strong  When you are charging your iPhone, take it out of its case. While this may be inconvenient, it will help.  h23. CPU Usage/h2  If your phone is heating up, you may have a lot of applications open. Also, if you were playing a lot of games, then you can expect an increase in CPU usage and temperature as well.  All of the listed items below can contribute to an increase in CPU Usage:  ul liGames/li liData Usage (Facebook, Emails)/li liFetch/Push Data/li /ul  strongPossible Solutions/strong  ol liDo a codeNetwork Connections Reset/code (Go to Settings = General = Reset = Reset Network Settings, then reboot (you will lose WiFi passwords)/li liTry disabling the following apps (in Settings = General = Restrictions): Multiplayer Games, Ping, App Store, iTunes Store. Then reboot. /li /ol  h24. Defect/h2  If nothing else works, then it is also quite possible that your iPhone is defective and if this continues to occur as you have stated, I would take it to an Apple Store. They may be able to better diagnose the problem.  h2Links and Resources/h2  MacRumours  Apple Discussion Board  Apple Discussion Board  <answer101607> Cases and Charging  Charging your iPhone while in certain carrying cases may generate excess heat, which can affect battery capacity.
