OS X 10.11 with PC keyboard, change key binding to Linux (Gnome) like <body> I have both Mac and Linux. Switching between them is quite inconvenient. Are there easy solutions to make OS X like Linux in keyboard shortcuts?  I swapped ctrl and command modifier key with Karabiner, it got better but still I would prefer to use just one key (ctrl).  And shortcuts like ctrl + H to hide window conflicts with Linux applications key bindings (sublime). It seems there are quite a lot of changes to make.
