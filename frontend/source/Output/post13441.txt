Using Garage Band sounds for commercial purposes <body> Im making a Drumming app for the iphone and the ipod touch. I was searching for good drum samples around the internet, but couldn't find anything fitting. Then i thought of garageband and its drum kits which contained the samples that i needed.  Will apple allow me to use the garageband's kit sounds separatly and for commercial purposes?  <answer13447> No you can not - what you ask is akin to distributing the loops on a standalone basis as loops. But you're free to incorporate them into your own commercial works. There's an Apple KB article on it: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2931  <answer13449> Actually, you can't. The linked article specifies exactly that you can't:     to create your own original music   compositions or audio projects. You   may broadcast and/or distribute your   own music compositions or audio   projects that were created using the   Audio Content, however, strongindividual   audio loops may not be commercially or   otherwise distributed on a standalone   basis/strong, strongnor may they be repackaged/strong in   whole or in part as strongaudio samples/strong,   sound effects or music beds."   (emphasis mine)  You can create as many songs as you want using all the sounds you have in the loops and sell the songs. But you will be packaging the sounds (or repackaging) as audio samples of your application which seems to be forbidden.  <comment14217> No you can't. Yes you can make music, all that you want, but you can't repackage a sound or audio sample as is. (Which a *good drum sample* is) <comment14219> I stand corrected - I went looking for the link after my first post and didn't reread it all. <comment14221> On the other hand, I don't know if Apple has any means to "notice" that ;) <comment14227> tnx, i thought it wouldn't be possible either, but i just had to ask :)
