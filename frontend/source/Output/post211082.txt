10.11 Prohibitory Symbol after Reimage or Kernel Panic on NetBoot <body> I apologize if this is convoluted. I've tried so many different ways of getting this to work that I'm getting them all mixed up.  With the launch of Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan, we've encountered some serious issues with our deployment strategies. First, the new SIP prevents -bless commands from working, preventing us from doing our multiple-OS configuration boot system.   But a bigger problem at the moment is that we can't even image any Mac newer than 2012.   We use DeployStudio both to create the images and to deploy them using the NetBooter with automated workflows set to each serial number (We have about 160 Macs). Our server is running the latest DeployStudio (1.6.15) on OS X 10.10 using Server 4.0.3. The image is applied to the Mac successfully, but upon the first boot into the OS, the standard globe will appear, then the OS X 10.11 progress bar and finally result in a prohibitory symbol (circle with a slash through it).  The OS X 10.11 Mac image was created initially on a Mid-2011 21.5" iMac. I have since recreated from scratch (erased drive, installed 10.11 from App Store Installer) on a Mid-2015 MacBook Pro to eliminate the possibility of some incompatibility. However, the result was identical.   I've tried to upgrade the server as well. I went to OS X 10.11 running Server 5 with the same DeployStudio version. However, after creating the NetBoot for that server, every Mac that boots into it immediately Kernel Panics with the following error:  precode"Unable to find driver for this platform: \"ACPI\".\n'@/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/xnu/xnu-3247.1.106/iokit/Kernel/IOPlatformExpert.cpp:1665" /code/pre  It appears this is a known issue with DeployStudio and 10.11. Apple removed some of the files that DeployStudio depended on.  I'm at a complete loss. Does anyone have any recommendations?
