How do I delete one of my custom templates in Numbers - OS 10.10.1 <body> I would like to delete one of my custom templates I made in Numbers - in previous OS versions you went to LibraryiWorkNumbersTemplates and just trash it - but, since I updated to Yosemite - I only see Keynote in the iWork Library folder? No Numbers? Any ideas?  Thank you.  <answer170663> In Pages, you can save the template to Desktop and then move it to Trash.  Maybe it works the same in Numbers.  <answer193255> Rename or delete a custom template After you install a template, it appears in the My Templates category in the template chooser.  In the template chooser, Control-click the template name, then choose Rename or Delete.  If you’re renaming, type a new name, then press Return.  You can’t rearrange templates; they always appear in the order in which they were added.  <answer234074> Right-click or kbdCommand/kbd + Click on unwanted template, then delete it.  <comment230241> They always appear in alphabetical order for me. <comment286108> answer is relevant to Numbers v3.6.1 <comment286119> This adds nothing that isn't already said in the upvoted answer [except that your key-command is wrong]
