Screen sharing default observer mode <body> I have several code.vncloc/code files what contains lines such:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;URL&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;vnc://10.10.10.11&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  e.g., double click on the file starts the codeScreen Sharing.app/code, and connect to the defined vnc URL.  By default it connects in emcontrol mode/em and I need switch manually to the emobserver/em mode.  It is possible to add something to the code.vncloc/code file, to connect in the observer mode by default?  <answer172267> .vncloc files are simply URL pointers to the vnc:// URI scheme. This scheme is not standard and currently does not have a way to delineate the mode of the screen share.  <comment247671> Depending on which mode you are in when saving the .vncloc files (Control or Observe) the relevant keycontrolMode/key stanza is set to either 0 or 1 and saved to the file. Yet these paramaters are completely ignored when launching Screen Sharing. Very strange behavior. Maybe in future versions these params will be honored.
