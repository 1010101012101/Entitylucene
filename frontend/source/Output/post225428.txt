Is it possible to use the Apple IR Remote with other computers having an IR port? <body> I'd like the shiny aluminum remote so much that I'd like to use it for everything.  Is it possible to use it as a remote for a PC controlling e.g. PowerPoint or a music player, like I can do with a PC remote?  Additional software needed?  <comment273520> Are you thinking you want software on the remote? Or perhaps explain in particular detail what other device/haerdware and operating system you'd be looking for software recommendations... <comment273532> I would Google the phrase "use apple tv remote for powerpoint" <comment273983> Of course I've Google'd and found only links to using it as a remote for PowerPoint on a *Mac*. The heading says what I am trying to investigate.
