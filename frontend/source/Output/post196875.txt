Compress images to PNG in Mac Mail <body> Is there a way to have Mac Mail compress images to PNG rather than JPEG by default?  I've noticed that a high resolution JPEG source image looks better when compressed to a low resolution PNG than a low resolution JPEG.  Screenshots can be saved as PNGs with this:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture type png /code/pre  I'm looking for something analogous to this.  <comment235256> My mail just adds the image I present it, compression is optional. Just attach a PNG if you want a PNG <comment235280> Thanks.  I know Mac Mail will keep a PNG a PNG, but I'm trying to save a step in converting a JPEG to a PNG.  I.e. my camera takes JPEGs, and I want to send out reduced resolution PNGs.  I'd rather not open the photo in Preview and reduce/convert manually. <comment235336> It is not the task of Mail to handle this. Have you looked at Automator? Automator can convert, compress images and setup an email message (using Apple Mail) <comment235549> That's helpful.  Thanks.  I will look at Automator.
