How can I play a sound from the command line running as sudo? <body> While typing codeafplay danger.mp3/code in the Terminal will play the .mp3, doing codesudo afplay danger.mp3/code or codesudo su/code and then codeafplay danger.mp3/code does not.  Any idea why is this? How can I use the codeafplay/code command with strongsudo/su/strong?  <comment67187> Ok this is totally weird.  I looked at the console app and when I "sudo afplay" I see this 7/29/12 7:29:52.567 PM coreaudiod[140]: 2012-07-29 07:29:52.566586 PM [AirPlay] Stopping endpoint 'Living Room Apple TV' 7/29/12 7:29:52.630 PM coreaudiod[140]: 2012-07-29 07:29:52.629656 PM [AirPlay] Disconnected from [fe80::5a55:caff:fe0e:8cba%en0]:49152 (from [fe80::223:dfff:fefd:b8b5%en0]:53791) 7/29/12 7:29:52.631 PM coreaudiod[140]: 2012-07-29 07:29:52.631078 PM [AirPlay] Stopped endpoint 'Living Room Apple TV' <comment67188> I don't see those entries in the console when I run afplay without sudo.   Also I verified my sound is set to go to the internal speaker.  FYI--I am using Mountain Lion <comment67189> Works for me with sudo for local sound output. Are you trying to play the sound over Airplay ? <comment67192> I'm not trying to but thats would it seems like its doing.  I checked my system preferences and sound output it set to "Internal speakers" although I do see my two air play devices also listed.    Its weird the problem only occurs when I run afplay as sudo or su <comment67319> I can't reproduce it either. Have you tried disabling the AirPlay devices?
