How do I find out which file(s) an app is trying to read at launch? <body> The other day MultiMarkdown Composer started crashing on launch, and I can’t get it to stop. (The app appears in the dock and then immediately crashes again.)  I have tried:  ol liDeleting the app and reinstalling it/li liDeleted files and folders:  ul li~/Library/Preferences/com.multimarkdown.composer.mac.* /li li~/Library/Application Support/MultiMarkdown Composer/ /li li~/Library/Caches/com.multimarkdown.composer.mac//li /ul/li licodeopen -F -a 'MultiMarkdown Composer'/code  ul li-F  Opens the application "fresh," that is, without restoring windows. Saved persistent state is lost, except for Untitled documents./li /ul/li /ol  Trying to app in a separate user account emworks/em, so it has to be something related to my user account, but I can’t figure out what.  The developer looked at the crash logs and they indicate that it’s trying to read a file when it starts up, but the logs don’t show which file.  So I am trying to find out what files/folders are being accessed when the app is being launched, thinking that might lead to a solution.  What tools are available to do that, and how should I use them?  I tried codesudo fs_usage -w -f pathname -f filesys/code but that didn’t appear to show anything useful.  Any other ideas?  em(This is on Mac OS X 10.8.5)/em  <answer117383> Try using codeopensnoop/code:  precodesudo opensnoop /code/pre  (You can also use code-n/code to specify the process name, but it doesn't work with arguments that contain spaces by default. To fix it, replace code"'$pname'"/code with code"'"$pname"'"/code in code/usr/bin/opensnoop/code.)  You could also try to delete files in code~/Library/Containers//code or code~/Library/Saved Application State//code.
