Standard text rates applied.  Placing the automatic copy forward required a few easy to follow instructions provided by the phone service carrier.  <comment121438> These are all Backup apps that run on computers and used to store messages as a file on them. There is no app I can see that does what the OP wants.ANd if you actually had looked at the links instead of just coping and pasting you would have seen that. The person whose post you copied evens says as such. <comment151071> I use Google Voice which does that and it works well. <comment169145> Shouldn't there be an app that does this for free?
