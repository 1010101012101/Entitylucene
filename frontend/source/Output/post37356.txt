Why are marked E-Mails by iPhone's Mail.app not shown in GMail's marked folder? <body> I have a GMail account (Google Apps with my own domain) hooked up as an exchange account in my iPhone.  strongIf I mark an E-Mail (as shown in the screenshot) on my iPhone, it is not regonized by the GMail Web Client aka shown in the emmarked/em folder./strong  Do I have to configure something in my iPhone to fix this or is this not possible?  The text in the screenshot is german, but I think it is clear what means what. :-)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n6EPO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer37389> I dont think this is possible using the iPhone mail app. Marking an item with the iPhone mail app doesnt 'star' it on Google.  I'd recommend trying the official Gmail App for iPhone and iPad.  <comment42393> The GMail App improved a lot since the last time I used it. Thanks a lot! <comment42396> Yeah they took it down for a period due to issues, but the latest version works well.
