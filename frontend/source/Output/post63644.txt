Vmware Fusion + Ubuntu 12.04, shortcut <body> I'm running vmware fusion 5 under OS X Mountain Lion. My virtual machine is running Ubuntu 12.04.  I have two fastidious shortcuts which I would like to disable:  ul liWhen I press kbdCommand ⌘/kbd, Ubuntu opens the dash and shows under the text field a set of icons./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ELcj8.png" alt="Command shortcut effect"  ul liWhen I press the kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbd`/kbd keys (which I use for making accented letters) Ubuntu opens the dash without showing the icons under the text field./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/drxce.jpg" alt="Option+` shortcut effect"  How can I disable or block these shortcuts?  <answer111830> I tried playing around with the keyboard settings in Fusion, in particular editing particular profiles.   This did not change the behaviour of kbd⌘/kbd in unity. I did not play around with kbd⌥/kbd+kbd`/kbd as I could not replicate your Ubuntu behaviour.  The only way I found to disable the kbd⌘/kbd shortcut is to install codegconf-editor/code and remove the shortcut from within Ubuntu running the following commands:  precodesudo apt-get install gconf-editor gconftool-2 --set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/shortcut_overlay --type bool false /code/pre  <comment73611> This seems more a question about configuring Ubuntu, or am I mistaking? If so maybe you should ask it on askubuntu.com instead? <comment73616> @Gerry I think its valid for both, becuase there some special associations between the keys of a Mac keyboard with the keys of a virtual machine. Btw I would post the same question also there. Is it ok? <comment73620> I don't see how the answer to this question would be any different for Ubuntu virtualized under Windows or under Ubuntu itself for example, so imo it's probably off-topic here. <comment73635> I don't agree with you because as I said, vmware decide how the real keys are mapped to the virtualized keeys. So, since the mac have a different keyboard, the case is different from a case in which Ubuntu is virtualized for example on a windows pc. However I posted it on askubuntu.com.
