Typing inverted question / exclamation marks in Swiftkey on iPhone <body> Is it possible to enter these characters? (For Spanish text)  I could not find them, and I'm sure I'm using the Spanish QWERTY keyboard in SwiftKey (with the ñ)  <answer216384> As @bassplayer7 suggested, I need to hold the code!/code in the symbols page. I was expecting to have this in the code!@#,.?/code key, like in Android.  <comment261438> On the built in keyboard, I tap and hold the "!" to see an option for "¡". Does that work for you? <comment261439> `alt/option + !` for ¡ and `alt/option + shift + ?` for ¿ . Is this what you're looking for ? <comment261440> @bassplayer7 yes, it does. It would be nice to have that in SwiftKey's "shortcut" punctuation key, though. <comment261441> @maetsoh iPhone+SwiftKey, not OSX. <comment261442> oh sorry then holding the keys ! and ? is what you're looking for <comment261443> the iOS keyboard layout is different from Android's <comment261444> @maetsoh and worse. <comment261446> @Alex.S you would if you were using the Spanish keyboard. <comment261448> Yes, I have already tried it :) <comment261450> @Alex.S I don't have my Android phone anymore; otherwise I'd show you a screenshot :-). But it was definitely there (to the left of the popup) <comment261451> I wanted to say "yes, you are right. I tried the spanish layout and `¡` was here". Sorry for confusion :) <comment261452> @Alex.S ah. No worries :-)
