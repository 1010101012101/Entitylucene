How to identify the 3 thermals sensor connectors from the mac mini motherboard? <body> I opened my mac mini to switch the DVD with another hard drive and I forgot to take a picture with the ways the 3 thermal sensors are connected.  THeir codes on the mainboard look like:  ul liJ5550 - left one, when you look from the front of the mini (dvd opening towards you)/li liJ5520 - middle one /li liJ5560 - right one - the closest to the two sata connectors/li liOne of them is for the DVD/li liOne of them is for primary HDD near the connect/li liOne of them for the primary HDD on the other side (glued)/li /ul  How do I pair them? It's important as I do not want to mess the logic of power management.  <answer274293> I suspect that you have found the answer via other means, but I'll answer it for the next person that finds their way here.  I was looking for a way to repair the connector on the motherboard when I found this question unanswered.  I'll continue my search after answering.  So, after much double checking:  ul liOne of them is for the DVD.  ul liThis is connector strongJ5550/strong. From your perspective, the left one./li /ul/li liOne of them is for primary HDD near the connect.  ul liThis is connector strongJ5560/strong. From your perspective, the right one./li /ul/li liOne of them for the primary HDD on the side (glued).  ul liThis is connector strongJ5520/strong. From your perspective, middle one/li /ul/li /ul  PS: I would recommend including your Mini model in the future.
