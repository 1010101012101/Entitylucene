How to disable iOS 7 warning about mobile data being turned off for an app <body> I use an app that can consume a sizeable amount of bandwidth, so I have disabled mobile data for that app under emSettings/em  emMobile/em  emUSE MOBILE DATA FOR/em  em[App Name]/em  emOFF/em. The setting works great, and prevents the app from using any mobile data, so it only updates when I'm connected to WiFi.  The only problem is that, now, whenever I start the app, iOS 7 pops up the following modal dialogue:     Mobile Data is Turned Off for "App Name".   You can turn on mobile data for this app in Settings.      [Settings]    [OK]   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DdiNT.png" alt="enter image description here"  This message is so Ã¼ber-modal that you can't even press the Home button before tapping strongOK/strong. It has become very frustrating.  Is there any way to disable the modal warning to remind me that mobile data is turned off for an app?  hr  strongEdit/strong: The answer to this problem detailed here.  <comment140796> I have several apps where I have turned off mobile data. I know very well that I have done this, so I don't need the phone to tell me this each f*** time I move outside WiFi coverage!! This is the most irritating feature ever.
