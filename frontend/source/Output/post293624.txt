Flashing question mark folder and nothing works <body> I have an older iMac (2007) which has Mavericks installed. It won't boot anymore and shows the flashing question mark folder (probably because we inserted an external hd before, but this is removed).  My problem is, that all the alternative option (kbdCmd/kbd kbdR /kbd / kbdS /kbd / kbdX/kbd / kbdC/kbd) don't work and I just get the flashing folder again (the keyboard is wire-usb). I have inserted an bootable usb drive and tried starting with the kbdAlt /kbdkey, but it only shows the cursor, and nothing else.  Is there anything else I can try?   <comment370532> Go to genius bar. Hard drive death! Actually, when mine was doing this, the connecting wire from the hard drive to the computer was partially unplugged for some reason. Tightening that guy right back up got me back in action. <comment370536> When you say "you inserted a bootable USB drive" what OS were you trying to boot?  It sounds like you were trying to boot Linux and it may have been a 64bit when the EFI on that model is 32bit.  *Do you have a bootable macOS USB or DVD?*  Also see this answer:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/236718/imac-only-show-flashing-folder-with-question-mark-after-formatting-os-x-partitio/236749#236749 <comment370539> @Allan its a Mavericks bootable usb drive <comment370540> Are you *certain* that the USB flash is functional?  Have you tested it another machine?  Short of that, try running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected. <comment370545> @Allan yes, i tried it with a Mac Mini, working fine. Pressing "D" on the faulty iMac doesn't work either, it just gets to the questionmark folder.. :/ <comment370550> Does your keyboard work?  Can you test it on a different machine? <comment370555> Have you tried internet recovery with CMD+ALT+R? <comment370568> @Allan yeah, unfortunately it works :) <comment370570> @M.J.K yes, just goes to the folder icon :( <comment370670> Can you make, or do you have access to a bootable CD/DVD of Mavericks?
