how do I install SIPSAK? <body> How and where is this installed from on a Mac?  For context, SIPSAK is the SIP Swiss Army Knife:     sipsak is a command line tool which can send simple requests to a SIP server. It can run additional tests on a SIP server which are usefull for admins and developers of SIP enviroments.   http://sourceforge.net/projects/sipsak.berlios/  I installed Mac Ports, but, apparently, it's not in Mac Ports.  Slightly odd, but ok.  Surely it's in some sort of Mac repo?  <comment209999> Did you try to just build it from source? <comment210004> Given that all of the websites for this project seem to have disappeared (sipsak.berlios.de, sipsak.org, etc.) not sure why it would be odd that it's not in MacPorts. There is a list of [popular repositories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_package_management_systems#Mac_OS_X) for OS X at Wikipedia to try. <comment210014> I do find sipsak when searching for it in HomeBrew (http://brew.sh) on Yosemite. Haven't tried installing it though.
