Is there a way to disable all notifications on the iPhone, even the slide down action? <body> (strongupdate/strong: Silencing the notifications in the Do Not Disturb doesn't work. Because the notifications still slide down from top of the screen, affecting the screen recording).  If I am doing screen recording on the iPhone: if Facebook shows a notification, and you turn it off, and then WeChat does it, and you turn it off, and then Line does it.  Is there a way to turn off all notifications, especially true when you do screen recording, instead of turning them off one by one, and then when done, turn them on one by one again?  (screen recording is iOS 11 public beta 2, but the method to turn off all notifications may already exist on iOS 10).  P.S. disabling each app really doesn't work well, because I turned off WeChat and Facebook, and then YouTube had a notification, and I turned it off. Then Slack had a notification, and I turned it off, and then Twitter had a notification, and then Discord. Unless you turn off all 35 apps and whatever apps you have, you really can't be sure which one might send you notifications.  <answer290957> ol liSet notification preview to never/li liEnable DND/li liRemove apps and disable notifications that don't respect the above settings./li /ol  For some testing you might be able to disable cellular and then block the APNS servers or all internet or just Apple's servers, but local notifications will still trigger since they are designed to do so.  Your best bet for controlling a demo is to control all the apps and settings closely rather than using a fully loaded device with many sources of distraction or interruption.  Source.  It looks like you need to make sure DND is set to codeAlways/code:  h1Change Your Settings/h1  If you don't want to be disturbed at a certain time, you can set a schedule. Tap codeSettings &gt; Do Not Disturb/code and turn on codeScheduled/code. Then set a time.  You can also choose when you want to receive alerts, calls, and notifications:  ul liAllow Calls From: Allow calls from everyone, no one, your favorites, or specific contact groups stored on your device or iCloud./li liRepeated Calls: If someone calls you twice within three minutes, the call won't be silenced./li listrongSilence/strong: Choose to strongsilence calls and notifications always/strong or only when the device is locked./li /ul  <answer293330> I just noticed a new Mac app that states it stops all notification messages.   Muzzle is free and according to the developer:     Muzzle was born in a group iMessage thread. See, Brian was screensharing with a client when Josh sent him a message about that client, which macOS delightfully showed...to the client. Bad times were had by all. But Brian and Josh knew a Mac developer. And that Mac developer had a working build of Muzzle in their hands five hours later.   I'm not saying this app will solve all your problems, I just saw it and thought I'd pass it on.   <comment367297> Do Not Disturb, or Airplane mode? [Can't test, not on iOS 11] <comment367301> the phone is already in do not disturb mode, but the message will still slide down and show on the top of the screen <comment367309> like I said, the notifications can be silent, but they still slide down from the top of the screen, affecting the screen recording <comment367313> That's all I could find from Apple.  You already know you can silence individual apps so that might be your only option right now.   I would also recommend leaving Apple [product feedback](https://www.apple.com/feedback/) and requesting this feature. <comment367384> Not sure who downvoted this, but Apple makes the software so don’t blame the messenger here. <comment367394> How come you are not saying anything about the two people who downvoted this question? <comment367675> @bmike There are tons of information out there on the Internet. As a messenger, are you to bring the correct answer here or can you bring anything that seems related here? Ask Different is for you to bring in the correct solution. If your solution is not correct, and you are the messenger, why do you bring that material in? <comment367696> @太極者無極而生 Question voting is a lot more loose and I can't fault someone for feeling it's unclear or just a yes/no question. For instance - the update at the top makes it more confusing to me and in the end - you know one answer is turn off each app that you don't want notifications or uninstall those apps. You did do a very good job not making it into a rant - why doesn't apple make this easier. +1 for that. My guess is you'll get + votes now that the title is far less confusing - good edit there. <comment367697> @太極者無極而生 As to correct - the stack exchange model is to have information, hopefully sourced and let the voting determine correctness. As moderators, We do not remove wrong answers - but we do comment on them and vote on them we do provide more correct answers so that voting surfaces the best and most correct ideas. I'm happy to discuss more on [meta] or [chat] if you'd like <comment370077> @Tetsujin mentioned Airplane mode. Good solution unless you need to be online for your recording.
