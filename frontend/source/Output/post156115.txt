permanently stop iPhone text messages from appearing on my iMac <body> How do I permanently stop iPhone text messages from appearing on my iMac. I don't want to send/receive/view messages on my computer. I only want to use my phone for sending/receiving/viewing messages. Also, I'm hoping the fix doesn't require constant maintenance. I've gotten advice for this before, but the fix has to be repeated every time I restart my computer.  <answer156137> To disable Text Message Forwarding:  ol liOn your iPhone, open the Settings app, then tap on Messages, then Text Message Forwarding./li liTap on the on/off button across from your Mac's name to disable./li /ol  <answer156144> If you specifically mean iMessage, rather than SMS forwarding, then ...  ul liLaunch Messages on the Mac/li liMessages menu  Preferences  Accounts  [Settings]  Sign out/li /ul  <comment186964> Thank you for the informaton but the "Preference" tab is located under the "Message" heading & not the "File" heading. <comment186970> oops, so it is. Fixed. <comment225085> I find it disturbing to see that in my case this option is not selected, and never had been, and that if I had it was *supposed* to be something I would've approved with a passcode. Lovely... <comment225086> This answer is specifically regarding SMS forwarding. IMessages are always sent to both places, assuming you are signed into the same Apple ID on each device/computer. <comment225089> I find it disturbing that the top answer suggests the opposite, which is that it requires something be initiated from the iPhone requiring a passcode. But all I had to do was use the same apple ID and it's already doing it, and I have to disable it from the macbook indeed. So it's intercepting SMS from my cell carrier on systems I didn't specifically approve for doing that. And the phone itself indicates that it would not allow such a thing. Lovely <comment225092> tubedogg's answer is specifically for SMS, mine is for iMessage - they are 2 different things. Lots of info at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681
