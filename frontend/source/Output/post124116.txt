Making Screen Saver Images full screen <body> I set up the screen saver to a folder containing some of my photos.  How do I get the screen saver in Mavericks to display them full screen?  <answer124119> Go to System Preferences → Desktop &amp; Screen Saver and choose the Classic screen saver:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5OPEY.png" width="108"  <answer124120> Since the Classic mode might not show full screen (depending on original size)   I would use the:  Ken Burns Option in the settings.  Go to System Preferences → Desktop &amp; Screen Saver and choose Ken Burns mode.  There is some animation going in that mode but it is rather pleasing.
