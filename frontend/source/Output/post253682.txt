iMac keep coming out of screensaver <body> I have iMac 5K made 2014 works fine but i noticed it frequently comes out of the screen saver mode with out any one touching mouse and key board. I have preference set to Energy Saver Only box that i have checked off is "Prevent from sleeping automatically when display is off". All other options are unchecked and top option "Turn display off after".. to never. I am using 10.11.6. Any one knows how i can stop this behavior.  moniz.m
