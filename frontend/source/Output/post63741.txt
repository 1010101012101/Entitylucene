Fake Webcam / Webcam Emulator Mac Os 10.7.4 64Bit running as a Virtual Machine. <body> I am looking for fake webcam solution for Mac OS 10.7.4 64bit running as a Virtual Machine.  What I tried:br ManyCam - only works with 32bit Browser and then not with all flash applicationsbr CamCamX - crashes on startupbr CamTwist - Crashbr  Is there any other solution out there?  <answer83373> OS X's Quartz Extreme video processing framework and services are not available under OS X 10.7.4 when running inside any kind of Virtual Machine.  <answer182032> Have you tried iGlasses? It's not free but I think there is a demo.  <comment73738> I've never had a problem with CamTwist since Leopard all the way through now (10.8.1). I would suggest trying to contact the developer. Commented and not answered since you exclude it in your Question. <comment78792> the problem occurs because , quartz extreme isn't available in MacOS Vms. I have a MacOS Server , starting several VMs for testing reasons.
