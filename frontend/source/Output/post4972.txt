In OS X, I want to change to a non-standard keyboard shortcut for switching spaces <body> In System Preferences  Expose and Spaces  Spaces Tab  to switch between spaces, there is a drop down list that allows you to select a modifier key and the arrows. The arrows are so far away from the rest of the keyboard! I want to bind to the vim keys (h, j, k, l) for (left, down, up, and right). On my ubuntu machine, I push the equivalent of command-option-j to go down a space. Does anyone know how to change to a non-standard keyboard shortcut on osx?  (I ran across a post that details how to change the modifiers, but still uses the arrow keys. This is not what I'm trying to do. Custom keyboard shortcuts to change active Spaces desktop)  <answer4984> Go to emSystem Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts/em. Then, on the left side, select emExposé &amp; Spaces/em. On the right side you will see the current keyboard shortcuts for Exposé and Spaces. If you double click on the shortcut command (literally double click code^1/code for instance) you will be able to change this to whatever you want. Just do the key-combo you want to use.  So, once you double-click on the shortcut, it'll show it as editable. Then, press the keys you want the short cut to be, all at once, for instance press codeApple/code and codeJ/code at the same time, and it'll change the shortcut.  <answer5050> I think matthepavkov has your answer, but also check out KeyRemap4MacBook for it's vi modes.   <comment5062> @Nate: I think matthepavkov has your answer, but also check out KeyRemap4MacBook for it's vi modes. <comment5123> thanks - this is close to what I wanted, except that the "switch between spaces" option doesn't appear on that list. <comment5126> @calavera - KeyRemap4MacBook allowed me to accomplish the feat. Under Vi Mode I selected the option for Command_L+hjkl, which magically works in tandem with the standard modifier from before. I wish there were a native way to do this, but this does the trick. Thanks! <comment5129> great, once again the awesome keyremap4macbook saves the day :P  i switched my comment to an answer. <comment5143> @zm1th Are you in 10.6? I tried this and it worked perfectly. Once you're in the *Keyboard Shortcuts*, click on *Exposé & Spaces* which appears on the left. On the right, you'll see a list of items for *Exposé* and also for *Spaces*. Is *Spaces* not shown there? <comment5272> yeah, there are shortcuts for selecting a specific space, but there are not shortcuts for switching between spaces. <comment5712> @zm1th Correct. There doesn't seem to be a way to change from the arrow keys to something else. There may be a command line way, but I'm not sure. You can also use the `fn + F8` to bring up all four spaces, and then click the one you want. <comment23478> Somebody actually likes the vim keys? :O i didn't think that was possible
