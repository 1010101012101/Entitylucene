Least annoying slideshow export format for iPhoto to iMovie <body> When percolating slide shows from iPhoto '11 to iMovie '11, what is best format to choose for export to minimize wasted disk space and time, given that I do not want to carry any audio? I've been using QuickTime, on the theory that Apple's programs would behave best with Apple's format, but I'm beginning to wonder.  <answer7343> The H.264 codec that the QuickTime format uses is a part of MPEG-4.br To get the best results, tweak the options for MPEG4.  Go File → Export → Slideshow → Custom Export → Movie to MPEG-4 → Options….br Below is a screen cap of the options I recommend for you. You can adjust the resolution and bitrate depending on the quality you want (higher numbers = higher quality).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/45fsm.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B5dpv.png" alt=""
