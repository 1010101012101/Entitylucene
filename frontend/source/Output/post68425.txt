When is a message charged? <body> I opened my contacts, clicked my friend's name and using his email, sent him a message. My friend's email is associated with an apple account. Yet when the message was delivered, it turned green. Does it mean that I was charged for the message? Is it necessary that the sender is charged whenever the message turns green? I don't have an SMS package or any other prepaid options. I have a simple AT&amp;T plan with limited talk time and 300 MB of data.  My friend lives in a different country and uses an iPod through his home wifi.  P.S.: I have asked this question on the official Apple forum (link). I think SE is a better place for such questions.  <answer68463> When the text bubble is stronggreen/strong instead of strongblue/strong, you're sending a strongSMS/strong instead of using emiMessage/em, being, therefore, charged for that.   Messages are sent as SMS when iMessage is unavailable, unless you disable this under strongSettings / Messages / Send as SMS/strong.  So, as I understand it, you either sent it to an non Apple ID email address, or the text couldn't reach the receiver through iMessage, changing to emSMS/em mode.   <comment79577> Thanks for the answer! But my friends iPod is not connected to any wireless service provider (it's connected through Wi-Fi to the internet, provided by a cable company). Ergo it doesn't have a phone number. Can such a device receive or send an SMS? <comment79595> @ShashankSawant No, but if you send an email to a non Apple ID email, it is sent through your Carrier, as MMS, charging you for that.
