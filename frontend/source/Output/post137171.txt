using file tags on OS X and windows <body> I use file tags in OS X 10.9.3 and I love it.  However, I store and access many of the same files on an external drive that I also access with a Windows computer.  Is there a way to see or search for those tags in Windows? I currently don't see anything under the "Tag" or "Label" attributes on Windows for files that I have tagged in OS X.  <comment162955> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about using mac software on other hardware. <comment162961> @Rob The asker wants to know how tags/labels can be shared on a drive which is accessed both by OS X and Windows <comment162962> How exactly do you mount/access the shared drive from OS X and from Windows? Which filesystem format are you using?
