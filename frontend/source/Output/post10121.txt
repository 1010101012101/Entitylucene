macOS cpu/mem monitor in system tray (menu bar) <body> I would like to monitor CPU and memory usage in realtime with charts on a macOS system tray (menu bar). Is there a utility that provides such functionality?  <answer10122> MenuMeters is popular among the Mac users I know.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RX98t.png"  <answer10123> iStat Menus is an app by Mac / iOS developers Bjango, but it's not free ($16).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vO3SW.png" width="136"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fNsHA.png"  <answer121415> I recommend SystemPal which is available on Mac App Store.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ld1Fx.jpg"  <answer182500> I recommend app called CheckMyMac  http://www.nomasoftwares.com  <answer210410> The iPulse program has been doing this since 2002.  It is recently updated for the Mac App Store and El Capitan and also works on older OS.  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ipulse/id1028916583?mt=12/li /ul  It's menu centric, dock centric and/or HUD style visualizations so you can choose exactly what and how you monitor the system performance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4KRhb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer234630> For OS X 10.11 or later, use this fork of MenuMeters: http://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/  (Open the code.prefPane/code file by kbdCtrl/kbd clicking and selecting Open.)  <answer234738> I also have the same needs but many such softwares are not free, thus I made one myself. Feedback is welcome.  https://github.com/ningt/iStats  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z51H3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer261906> iStat Menus 5 now has a free version and works well for monitoring all kinds of system stats, including CPU and memory.  <answer276367> This is an old questions, but newcomers might be interested in Übersicht. This allows you to display the information on the desktop, not the menu bar, much like in Conky.  Übersicht uses HTML5 web technology, so has a very modern feel to customize.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MT1Ll.jpg" alt="Übersicht screenshot"  <answer285157> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P3sfZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Übersicht allows for creation of conky-like widgets using coffeeScript. coffeeScript uses HTML. So, display options, such as text size, font and opacity of the background are easily set. The widget sits in front of the background image, but behind any desktop items. Übersicht has many user contributed, downloadable widgets.  I created a conky-like widget for Mac and OS X using Übersicht: https://github.com/dumbo25/conky-for-mac  <comment10525> Take a look into [menumeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/), the description sounds like just what you're after. <comment10528> Thank you! That is exact what I need <comment10533> Since I may come across people here who may have used MenuMeters, I would like to ask whether it is stable in terms of memory leaks and crashes. <comment84387> @ayaz - You should ask this as it's own question <comment217310> Please read the [FAQ], especially http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/promotion and http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior <comment255063> Doesn't work with El Capitan. <comment256534> @ayaz: never had a crash on Yosemite ever.. unfortunately it doesn't work on the new El Captain, due to Apple's code signature restrictions. <comment260856> It's free and open source and there's a fork that DOES work with El Capitan, @Restuta <comment280721> The fork for El Capitan is here http://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/ <comment286864> Possible duplicate of [Light-weight system monitor tool/app for OSX](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/233676/light-weight-system-monitor-tool-app-for-osx) <comment286937> Menu Meters is not officially compatible with El Capitan. Here's a [source](http://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/) for an unofficial version.
