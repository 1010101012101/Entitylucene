Macbook pro low temperature tolerance <body> Can I bring my Macbook Pro car camping in temperatures that may reach -5 degrees F?  I have found a lot of information on high temperature tolerances but not on the low tolerances.  <answer76424> I just looked at the user manual for my Macbook Pro (mid-2012), and discovered this info:  strongStorage Temperature:/strong   ul li-4 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit/li /ul  emOperating Temperature:/em  ul li50 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit/li /ul  According to the storage temperature, it looks like your -5 F is calling it a little too close.  This appears to be an online copy of the user manual I have.  Look here for more manuals.  <comment88639> I can't offer any information on absolute temperature, but be sure when you warm it up that it happens *slowly*â€”otherwise condensation will form inside it, which is obviously not good! <comment88749> @Max, My pleasure.
