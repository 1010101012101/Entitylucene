Java issue with osx...installed latest but java apps not working <body> I have an odd issue on my MAC. I installed java 1.8 sdk so I can use some Java applications however when I run any java based apps, they look real weird or I can get an error saying to use the latest java.  When I am on the command line and I type in java -version it shows 1.8  Any ideas on why my java apps don't seem to work?  The odd thing is if I run the application from a disk image (before i move to the applications folder) it works completely fine.  <answer159460> The easiest solution is to update with "Java for OS X 2014-001" at the below link. Fixed a similar Java issue on all three computers I have.   http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US  <comment187402> What OS are you running? <comment187416> What java apps? and what is the exact error? <comment187451> Actually that's a downgrade and not an update because Java6 will be installed. It might fix some problems though. <comment187510> I tried this an no luck :( <comment187512> Mavericks....I tried using Maltego & Gephi.  One doesnt show the menu items correctly, the other says I'm using openjdk 1.6 which has a bug and to install 1.7 and closes.
