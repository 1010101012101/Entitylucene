How to make Apple Mail.app to use SOCKS proxy configured by a PAC file <body> For some reasons, I have to use a SOCKS proxy to access Gmail, otherwise, the connection will be blocked.  I tried the global SOCKS agent, and the Mail.app worked fine. Nevertheless, when I turned to use a PAC file to configure system agent automatically, the Mail.app wasn't able to access Gmail.  My questions:  ol liIs it possible to set proxy in Mail.app? That is, Mail.app passes its web traffic to the SOCKS proxy while other apps won't be influenced./li liIf the answer to the first question is NO, then how to modify my PAC file to make Mail.app possible to access Gmail?/li /ol  Any clues or suggestions would be appreciated.  hr  More info:  OS version: OS X 10.9.5  Mail.app version: 7.3 (1878.6)  The PAC file:  precodevar domains = {   "l.google.com": 1,   "gmail-imap.l.google.com": 1,   "googlepages.com": 1,     "googlesile.com": 1,    "google.co.jp": 1,    "gaeproxy.googlecode.com": 1,    "sshtunnel.googlecode.com": 1,    "googleusercontent.com": 1,    "goagent.googlecode.com": 1,    "google.com": 1,    "googlevideo.com": 1,    "google.com.hk": 1,    "tuite.googlecode.com": 1,    "gfwinterceptor.googlecode.com": 1,    "gtap.googlecode.com": 1,    "googleapis.com": 1 };  var proxy = "SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:1080; SOCKS 127.0.0.1:1080; DIRECT;";  var direct = 'DIRECT;';  function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {     var lastPos;     do {         if (domains.hasOwnProperty(host)) {             return proxy;         }         lastPos = host.indexOf('.') + 1;         host = host.slice(lastPos);     } while (lastPos &gt;= 1);     return direct; } /code/pre  <answer168475> Try go to strongNetwork Preferences/strong, select the network you want to set, and go to strongAdvanced - Proxies/strong. Then, set strongboth/strong Automatic Proxy Configuration and SOCKS proxy. It works for me.  FYI, if you're using Shadowsocks the PAC would probably be codehttp://127.0.0.1:8090/proxy.pac/code.  <comment197761> Thank you for the answer, but I'd tried this before I posted this question. Unfortunately, however, the pac file failed to pass the traffic of Apple Mail into the socks tunnel. Indeed, set both PAC and Socks proxy would help, but I'm afraid this should only be owing to the Socks proxy. Nonetheless, socks proxy get all the web traffic by setting Socks Proxy in Network Pref., which is not I want. <comment200066> exactly same problem here. Looks like, mail.app doesn't interact with the pac file. But in my case, I've made this test: Before I open mail.app I've a terminal window showing the log of the server that serves my pac file, and I'm able to see that it load the pac. But doesn't delivers the traffic to the proxy. If I use Network settings- Socks then it works. Have you solved it ?
