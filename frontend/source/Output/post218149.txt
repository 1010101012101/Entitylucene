How to insert horizontal line to page headers in Apple Pages <body> I need to include a horizontal line beneath the text of the header in each page of my document. I was able to add a line using the Shape tool, but I cannot get it to repeat when enough text is added to create additional pages.  Can someone tell me how to accomplish this? Here's a screenshot of how I'd like the top of each page to look: (obviously the page number would be different)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/36clW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer233722> Insert a line, move it on the page into the header box (this is easier if you have layout visible - VIEW / SHOW LAYOUT)  Make the line a section master (ARRANGE / SECTION MASTER / MOVE OBJECT TO SECTION MASTER)
