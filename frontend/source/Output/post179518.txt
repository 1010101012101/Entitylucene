iPhone, iOS 8.2, can't find photo stream: "Recently Added" album is missing <body> I'm just now trying to use photo stream for the first time, so maybe there's something I am missing about the way this works. I have pics on my mac, and I want to look at them on my phone. I take pics with my phone that I want to see on my mac. I turned on photo stream in both, and followed every set of instructions I can find for making sure that they're both set up properly.  On my mac, I can see shots I just now took with my phone. On my phone, I don't see the pics that I added to the photo stream using iPhoto. If I understand correctly, the Photos app on iOS 8 is supposed to have a "Recently Added" album alongside the "All Photos" album. Mine doesn't. Am I misunderstanding? Is this "Recently Added" set somewhere else? Some people refer to it as a "folder", but I don't know what that means. Maybe that's the problem, I'm looking in the wrong place?  One article I read said that photo stream pics will go into the "Recently Deleted" folder/album, but although I do have that folder/album, the pics from my mac are not there.  Am I totally misusing photo stream? I just want to see the same pics on my mac as on my iPhone. Sync'ing with iTunes seems to always involve blowing away one or the other set of photos. Is there no way other than iTunes?
