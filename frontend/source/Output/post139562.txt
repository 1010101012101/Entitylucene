MBP gets stuck when connected to external monitor via minidisplay-VGA <body> I'm using an MBP mid 2012. I used minidisplay-VGA to connect to external monitors. This worked for more than one year.   In the recent month, there are already more than 4 times that the MBP gets stuck right after the minidisplay-VGA is plugged in. The MBP does not react anyhow. The only way is to shutdown and boot it again. After that, I can continue to use the laptop for some time, carrying around, plugging/ unplugging the minidisplay-VGA adaptor...  This happens occasionally and I can not find relevant discussions online.
