Changing app stores <body> I have an iPhone 4S and I changed to the US store to view an app not available in the SA store. Now I cannot change back to the SA store. The message comes up that I need to change with no directions on how to do this.br How can I change stores?  <answer82536> this Apple support page would be a place to start.   In the Settings app:  ul litap Store in the sidebar/li litap your Apple ID on the right/li litap View Apple ID/li lienter password if required/li litap Country/Region/li /ul  You will need a valid payment method on file for the country you're changing to, which I assume you already have.
