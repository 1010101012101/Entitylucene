Iphone 5s screen recording via reflector and airplay <body> I'm trying to record my iPhone screen via reflector and airplay but I couldn't find the airplay symbol in my control center if I swipe from bottom to top. There is only airdrop no airplay.   OS: iOS 8.2   Device: iPhone 5s  Recorder Device: Mac Book Pro  Recorder OS: 10.10.2  <answer179593> You can record your iPhone screen in OS X if you connect your iPhone with your Mac via cable. You can then select your iPhone as an input device in QuickTime (or any other recording software).br strongNote:/strong This will only work if your iOS device has at least iOS 8 and your Mac has at least OS X 10.10  <comment212867> Why not connect the iPhone via cable?
