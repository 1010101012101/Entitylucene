How to show hidden files and folders in finder? <body> I have a folder that starts with a dot code./code but unable to display them in Finder.  How can I say that for folder X Finder should also display hidden files/folders?  <answer5871> I don't think you can set this for individual folders. To set it globally, so that Finder always shows hidden files, run Terminal and enter the following two commands:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  To switch back, do the same but substitute FALSE for TRUE.  <answer5873> I myself use hiddenfiles widget. it's so easy to use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6XdEG.jpg" alt="alt text"  Beside that you can use free 3rd-party software like Deeper or TinkerTool.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7wiT5.jpg" alt="alt text"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z1OYN.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer267322> You can customize Finder through Terminal commands such that it defaults to show/hide hidden files.   To show hidden files and restart Finder:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall Finder /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app /code/pre  To hide hidden files and restart Finder:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall Finder /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app /code/pre  s  <comment6092> +1 for hiddenfiles widget; incredibly easy to use <comment6093> Another +1 for the Hidden Files widget. Quick and easy. <comment20182> At the time of writing the download link for the Hidden Files widget is broken. <comment20235> @saw-lau I test the link at it's fine now. <comment20437> I'll just plug that Lion works the same as Snow Leopard with the hidden preference AppleShowAllFiles and Finder. <comment104079> Links to hiddenFiles/Deeper/TinkerTool are broken and landing page has no information about them. <comment104091> @vabhatia I fixed the link <comment104106> @Am1rr3zA - Deeper link is still only to AppStore the others are OK <comment104209> @Mark Thanks for your alert, I fixed it <comment323526> This still works up to El Capitan - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/258733/how-to-show-hidden-files-on-mac-without-terminal/258741#258741 for an Automator/hot key method. <comment330704> As of macOS 10.12,  Finder supports ⇧⌘. to toggle visibility of hidden files.
