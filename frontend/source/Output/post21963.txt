Expanding recently added songs <body> In my iPhone is there a way to get more "recently added" songs?br I have about 100 songs and I have added recently 5, now in my "recently added" I've got only those 5.  <answer21964> strongRecently Added/strong is a smart playlist. In iTunes, select it, go to strongFile â†’ Edit Smart Playlist/strong, and change the criteria. For example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/14xBf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Re-syncing your iPhone will apply these changes.  <comment24218> The Edit Smart Playlist entry is disabled (note: i have selcted recently added from the left menu) <comment24221> ah ok i found it! i wasn't selecting the right element in the left menu.
