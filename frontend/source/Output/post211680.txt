Why cannot discover user in Airdrop when open personal hotspot? <body> When my iPhone opens the personal hotspot, I cannot find other users via Airdrop. What is the theory behind it?  <answer211688> AirDrop is different than a personal hotspot.    A personal hotspot is for sharing your internet connection.  AirDrop has separate controls, located in the control center.   You must also turn on Bluetooth and wifi.  Official Apple doc with screenshots.
