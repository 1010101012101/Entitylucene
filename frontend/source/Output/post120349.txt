Automator to save all images in multiple mail messages <body> Is it possible to use automator to save all images from my Mail? I use Apple mail with 3 accounts, I want to filter messages by a criteria and get all the images from the messages? Can anyone tell me how can this be done?  <answer120452> I just tried this and it seemed to work, though you'll have to play with it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1FNG.png" alt="enter image description here"
