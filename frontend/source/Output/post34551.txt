Change volume of individual speaker <body> My headphones are a bit damaged it seems and the left has higher volume than the right. It isn't my ears, the song or the device :). Is there a program to change just one speaker's volume? Lion allows you to set the balance, but I don't think this is the same thing - it would lead to the sound shifting into the left speaker, effectively reducing the stereo effect. Windows 7 can do this, but I'm not quite that desperate.  <answer34555> Balancing changes the volume of both speakers at the same time.  strongSince it only changes the volume, there is not manipulation of the stereo effect (sound shifting)./strong  For example: If you play a track that plays on the left speaker and then shift the balance to the very right - you will not hear anything. If you play a stereo track, you will only hear the right track in the same case. This can be very easily verified using this this sample track.  <comment39485> Awesome, thanks!
