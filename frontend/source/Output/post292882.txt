Why are ssh and git push not working? <body> So recently, I have noticed that commands like codessh/code, codegit push/code, and codegit pull/code sometimes stop working. They only start working after I restart my computer. The interesting thing is that I can still browse the web, use other apps that require internet access perfectly fine.  I cannot SSH or make a VNC connection to a computer at my home, or pull/push on repos. Anybody have any idea what seems to be the issue? I am on strongmacOS Siera 10.12.5/strong on an strongApple MacBook Pro 2015/strong.  <answer292889> I used to have a similar issue back in Yosemite. Here is how I fixed it:  strongSystem Preferences/strong - strongSecurity or Security &amp; Privacy./strong - strongFirewall Tab/strong - strongClick the Lock and enter your password/strong - strongToggle Firewall on and off/strong - strongRestart your computer/strong  <comment369521> Thanks so much, I actually managed to figure this out myself a little while ago
