Is there a way to change the displayed desktop in Mission Control? <body> I'd like to be able to change the displayed desktop in Mission Control without actually exiting Mission control.  For example, if I'm on desktop 1 and I go into Mission Control, I see all of the applications in that desktop along with thumbnails for the other desktops.  Can I view the applications in the one of the other desktops without having to click on it and leave Mission Control and then go back into Mission Control?  <answer19619> Yes, you can.  Hold down the kbdoption/kbd key and click on the desktop.  The desktop you clicked on will slide into view.  <answer19620> Push kbdCtrl/kbd + kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd It also can be done by swiping if you have a Magic Mouse or Trackpad.  <comment21532> This is exactly the functionality I had in mind, but Paul's suggestion of swiping is probably what I will actually end up doing.  Thanks to both of you. <comment21537> My only comment is to wonder why I didn't try swiping. :-) <comment21540> Heh, so much to learn in OS X.
