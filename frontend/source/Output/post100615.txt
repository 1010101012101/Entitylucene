Unexpected app "Admin Alert" running on my machine <body> All of a sudden I noticed an application called "Admin Alert" in my dock.  This is a work computer, I'm wondering if this is some sort of "spyware" that our lovely IT department has installed on my machine.  I can't find any information about it online.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/foYDAiT.png" alt="Link"  (OSX 10.8)  <answer100616> Admin Alert is related to Dell KACE, an "appliance-based approach to systems management", and the admin alert icon appearing in the dock is apparently a bug.
