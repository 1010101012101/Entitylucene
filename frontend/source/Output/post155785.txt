find supress permission errors <body> Running find command on root folder :  precodefind / -type d -wholename "prog" -print /code/pre  Keep seeing errors like   precodefind: ./Users/auser/Library/Preferences: Permission denied /code/pre  How can I supress these? If no option in find can you help with a script that greps out the permission messages? Guess need to ignore output that has ": Permission denied" in the end.  <answer155789> A rather simple way would be to run  precodefind / -type d -wholename "prog" -print 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -v ": Permission denied" /code/pre  (which would filter out any folders with "Permission denied" in the name as well, but that's probably not an issue).  <answer155813> Here is the standard Unix way to run any command without the error messages and without having to take care of their format:  precodefind / -type d -wholename "prog" -print 2&gt;/dev/null /code/pre  code2/code is the file descriptor on which any command output error messages.  code/dev/null/code is a special file like the Trash but without the recovery function of the Desktop one.  code&gt;/code means here plug code2/code within code/dev/null/code.
