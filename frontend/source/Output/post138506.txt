auto start an ios app <body> I want an app(specifically Ip Messanger for iOs) to start on startup in my ipad ios 7.1.1. I saw this 3 years old source in github and write the following .plist file.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;  &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.mac.eijimiwa.ipmessenger&lt;/string&gt;      &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/var/mobile/Applications/268983D6-12F9-45B5-ABF4-5B5F3D1C5E90/IP\ Messenger\ for\ iOS.app/IP\ Messenger\ for\ iOS&lt;/string&gt;      &lt;key&gt;OnDemand&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;/false&gt;  &lt;/dict&gt;  &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  I cannot be sure if I made a mistake or the plist format is no longer supported by ios v7.1.1. Can anyone point me what I shall correct or other auto-start options?  <answer138509> You can't run GUI apps by running the binary like that.  Install strongopen/strong from Cydia, then use codeopen bundleid/code:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;open&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.app.bundleid&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  <comment163423> I know the 'open' tool. But can you tell me how I can I use it to start an app at start time? <comment163424> @Bere Added example. Remove your invalid *Program* key and replace it with the above, once you've installed open. <comment163426> thanks. one question... where shall I put the .plist file? In /Library/LaunchDaemons or /Library/LaunchAgents? <comment163427> @Bere Either should work I think (try both); not quite sure how iOS handles it as there's no login and don't have my device to hand right now to test. <comment163444> Thank you @George very much. I put the plist file in /Library/LaunchDeamons/ (it didn't work in /Library/LaunchAgents) and added the following configuration    `keyKeepAlive/keydictkeySuccessfulExit/keyfalse//dict` to make start and keep running it until normal exit.
