How to have multiple names in Apple Mail? <body> In Mail.app I can send e-mails on behalf of different mail addresses. It looks like this:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O5nPK.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've achieved this by inputting multiple e-mail addresses separated by a comma in the codeEmail Address/code field of the Account information in the Preferences.  I can also select a full name in the mail preferences: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y70eV.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, any name I input there is the same for all three reply-from e-mail addresses.  How can I set a name for each reply-from e-mail address?  <answer122145> In code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist/code :   ul liIn strongRoot/strong  strongMailAccounts/strong  strongItem #/strong where # is the account to which you want to link the new aliases./li liCreate a new strongemArray/em/strong called strongemEmailAliases/em/strong/li liIn this Array add a strongemdictionary/em/strong call strongemItem #/em/strong for each name you want /li liIn each dictionary you created add 2 strongemstring/em/strong fields : strongemname/em/strong and strongemalias/em/strong. /li liIn name you put the name and in aliases you put the mail address. /li liRestart Mail.app/li liEnjoy./li /ul  br / Here is a preview of this in the Xcode plist editor.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M1fgN.png" alt="Preview in Xcode"  <comment142491> Sounded good, but unfortunately doesn't work. The reply-from drop down list still only shows the e-mail addresses inputted in the `Email Address` field without any name. The EmailAliases doesn't seem to have any effect. <comment142492> I missed an important point. The EmailAliases Array must be in MailAccounts  Item # where Item # is the account to which you want to link the new aliases. <comment142508> Yes, it works now! Thank you for your prolonged attention! Oh, and just a small detail: the string field names are `name` and `alias` (as in your screenshot). Not `aliases` as you write in the fourth point. It's too small for me to edit it, could you please change it so future users don't get confused? <comment200293> really helpful! thanks - works on _yosemite_ too. <comment251590> I recently upgraded to Mac OS 10.11 and it stopped working. However, the file still incorporates the proposed changes, but the names are not listed anymore. It is also discussed here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/3881 <comment251594> For 10.11 I figured it out: In Mail  Preferences there is now a field: "Alias" where you can add multiple identities.
