Web access via Ethernet broken but Airport to same router works fine <body> I've seen lots of questions asking what to do when Ethernet works and Wi-Fi doesn't, but I seem to have the opposite problem.  System details are as follows:  ul li2009 Mac Mini (Intel Core Duo)/li liOS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)/li liFairly typical home network, with Centurylink ADSL service coming through an Actiontec DSL modem into a Buffalo wireless router/firewall/base station./li liOther computers in the house connect wirelessly to the Buffalo router which is configured to hand out IP addresses via DHCP and forward DNS requests to the DNS server (I'm using Google).  One of the Ethernet ports on the router is connected to the uplink port on a Netgear minihub, and two Macs (the Mini and an old G4 tower) are connected to that minihub./li /ul  With this setup my Mini can see the router in Network Preferences, and seems to be getting the DNS server address correctly via DHCP.  I can ping outside servers by IP address or by name and get response times under 100 ms.  Yet WWW access is incredibly slow.  Most pages that I open in Safari will take 5-10 minutes to load, if at all--usually the progress bar gets halfway through the title of the page and then just freezes.  This is a recent development (but of course I can't think of anything that might have changed to trigger it).  If I activate Airport and change the order of preferred networks in the Network Preferences pane to Airport first, Ethernet second, all of a sudden everything works fine.  I realize there is room for some hardware diagnostics to be done here.  I can take the minihub out of the equation by connecting the Mini directly to the Buffalo router, and I can try different Ethernet cables.  Beyond that I'm not sure what to do.  What can be done at the command line or via diagnostic software to see where the request packets are going and why nothing's coming back?  I'm really baffled as to why codeping/code to a server by name works fine, but Safari doesn't--my limited understanding of TCP/IP says that if the former works, the latter should too.  And why does wi-fi work fine, but a hard-wired connection straight to the router doesn't?

This problem may arise either when the autonegotiation process between your Mac Mini and the Netgear minihub fails or when speed/duplex mode are set manually and don't match at both ends.  To solve the problem you first need to check the Ethernet settings:   ul liOpen System PreferencesNetwork, select Ethernet from the list on the left and click kbdAdvanced.../kbd./li liSelect the Hardware tab./li /ul  Then:  ol liIf configure is set to "Automatically":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2fTWB.png" alt="enter image description here"  autonegotiation is on. Change it to "Manually" and try different Speed and Duplex settings, for example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IlYIe.png" alt="enter image description here"  until the problem is gone. Note that you must press kbdOK/kbd for the settings to take effect./li liIf configure is set to "Manually", change it to "Automatically" and test./li liIf nothing helps, try another hub or connect your Mac directly to the router. If that solves the problem replace your hub./li /ol  <comment110051> Can you open Terminal, run `ifconfig -v` and post its output? <comment110082> @jaume: Done, see above... <comment110083> Thanks, sounds promising--when I have time to play with this later today I will do so and report back. <comment110145> Thanks, I see that Ethernet is set to autonegotiate (`media: autoselect`). Could you add the output of `ifconfig -v` with Ethernet active? The `en0` section will suffice. <comment110333> @jaume: Done, see above... <comment110341> Thanks, that half-duplex may be causing the problem... Could you run `netstat -i` and add the output to your question? Only the line for `en0` is relevant. Please run `netstat -i` with Airport inactive and Ethernet active. <comment110346> @jaume: OK, there were three lines starting with `en0`. Thanks for your help! <comment110348> Thanks, `1385` is the number of errors caused by inbound traffic, that should be zero. What is surprising is that there are no collisions nor errors for outbound traffic. Could you (try to) open a couple of websites and check the output of `netstat -i` for `en0` again? If the 2 last numbers are different than zero it could indeed be a duplex mismatch problem. <comment110410> After opening and closing the Network pane in System Preferences as you suggested below (I didn't actually change any of the Advanced settings) the wired connection is now working fine... not hanging up on any web pages.  The last two numbers in `netstat -i` are still zeros.  The problem seems to have fixed itself but I don't understand why. <comment110413> Weird, that almost sounds like magic... maybe opening and closing the Network pane has forced a renegotiation, and both your Mac and the minihub could successfully agree on a common, supported speed and duplex mode. Anyway, it's great it works. <comment110451> I'm glad it works too but frustrated that I don't know for sure what happened.  I've given you the vote for "correct answer" regardless--at least if it happens again I will have a better idea what to look at, thanks to you!
