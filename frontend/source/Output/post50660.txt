How do add new proofing languages to Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac? <body> How is possible to add new spellchecking languages to Office 2011 for Mac?  I am referring to languages that are not listed in the relatively small (~20) default list of languages.  <answer50664> It is impossible, but a good place to ask might be the forums run by MS for its products:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macword  <comment58053> Please indicate which languages exactly you want.
