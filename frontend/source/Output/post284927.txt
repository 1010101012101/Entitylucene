Preview locks up or does not save resized images <body> I have an iMac running Sierra. I resized and image and then saved it and all seemed ok. When I reopen the original image and check info it is strongnot/strong resized.  Also, Preview locks up (spinning beachball) when I tried to rename a photo after resizing. Did the same thing also on another occasion when I tried to resize and save an image. Any ideas or simple suggestions to help me out? I am not an advanced user.
