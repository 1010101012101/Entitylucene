How to modify the transmit queue length (buffer) of the network interface <body> How can I set the transmit queue length for a network interface on OS X?  On linux the command would be:  precodeifconfig en0 txqueuelen 5 /code/pre  but OS X doesn't recognize txqueuelen as a valid option (nowhere mentioned in the man, nor an equivalent).  Where does OS X manage this kind of configuration?  Note: might be similar on BSD system...  <comment82337> Can you please explain your note? Might the answer you are looking for similar to an answer for BSD systems? <comment82349> Basically, OS X is based on a kernel (Darwin) which derives from one of the BSD UNIX (FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc. I don't remember which one) and OS X uses many of the BSD tools, ifconfig and sysctl being one of them. So for me OS X is just another BSD UNIX flavour, and the command to change the network interface buffer should be identical on FreeBSD and OS X. <comment82350> Thank you for the explanation. This might help to find and understand possible answers. Thus, +1 for the comment.
