Why does the USB-C Ethernet adapter get hot, even when unplugged from ethernet? <body> The new MacBook Pro have a bunch of USB-C ports and no ethernet port, so you have to use an adapter.  The issue is that as long as the adapter is connected to the MacBook, it gets very noticeably hot, even more than the power adapter.  This happens both when the ethernet cable is plugged into it or not.  Now, from reading other comments this seems to be normal behaviour, but I'd love to understand why! From an user's perspective, this does not seem right, and looks like it could cause the adapter to fail faster than it would without heating up.  <answer285009> Circuits heat up when electricity goes through them. There must be some circuit created regardless of the status of the actual Ethernet port. It probably has something to do with converting an Ethernet signal to something readable via USB that is always on.   <comment359302> The adapter has active circuitry inside, which is active whether it is in use or not. FWIW, this has been the case for all Ethernet adapters I've ever owned. <comment359304> Heat in electronics is merely the result of current being resisted as it passes through a medium. All electrical devices generate a certain amount of heat, even if you can't feel it. Gigabit ethernet adapters tend to use a lot of power relative to other peripherals, so a bit of radiant heat is to be expected.
