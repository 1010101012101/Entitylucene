AppleScript deployment conventions? <body> I haven't seen a package-management system for AppleScripts, but it seems like the foundations for one are present.  Given:  ul liScripts (and folder) located in the code~/Library/Scripts/Applications/code folder ARE NOT visible from OS X AppleScript menu./li liScripts (and folders) locate in the code~/Library/Scripts//code folder ARE visible from OS X AppleScript menu./li /ul  Implications:  ul li'Libraries' scripts (i.e. those referenced by codeload script/code) could be located in code~/Library/Scripts/Applications/&lt;namespace&gt;//code folder/li li'Controller' scripts (i.e. those that are run by users) could be located in code~/Library/Scripts/&lt;namespace&gt;//code folder/li liAn installation script could be used to compile the code.applescript/code files, create directories, and other minutiae./li liProjects would be located on codeGithub/code (or similar)/li liAll that would remain is a directory service/li /ul  Questions:  ul liIs there an AppleScript package-management system (that I've missed)?/li liIn lieu of that, is what I've described a reasonable deployment convention?/li liAre there any conventions for code&lt;namespace&gt;/code? Java uses reverse domain name (e.g. com.foo.project)/li /ul  <comment119332> Using `~/Library/Scripts/namespace/` would be problematic because that namespace would show up as the folder name in the AppleScripts menu.
