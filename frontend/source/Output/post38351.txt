Is iCloud Document Sync "delta sync" or "full file sync"? <body> I don't mean iWork docs but for example personal docs in GoodReader codeiCloud/code folder and perhaps Mac OS code~/Library/Mobile Documents/code.  Is there any official documentation about it?  <answer38356> I think that it is full file sync.  The delta aspect that you are wondering about would be with Versions (or Time Machine), and that is a separate set of functionality beyond the scope of iCloud's Documents.  <answer41846> Delta. It splits this intelligently into chunks and only updates the relevant chunks using Rabin fingerprinting.  You can see this in Apple's WWDC iCloud presentation, and  slides.  A pretty good description of this chunking can be seen in Siracusa's Lion review, however the review describes this process in terms of document versioning, but the fundamentals are the same.  <comment47469> Can you provide a source to back this up?
