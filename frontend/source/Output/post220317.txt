My find/replace text magically changes in Xcode <body> I had a project wide find/replace search all set up yesterday in my Xcode project. Today when I get back to Xcode (without restarting or touching it in any way) the search text has changed. The weirdest thing is that the search text is now the same as a text search I made today in Google Chrome(!). I know for a fact that I haven't searched for "shipping costs" in my Xcode project.  Could someone explain what's going on? I don't particularly like it when applications throw away my data and I would like to prevent this from happening again.  <answer220320> Find/replace uses what's known as the Kill Ring, rather than regular Copy/Paste  It's similar to the regular Copy/Paste buffers, but uses a separate memory area.    You can 'Kill' using kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd K /kbd which is similar to Cut &amp;br 'Yank' using kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd Y /kbd which is like Paste.  The kill ring is also used in a lot of search routines, so will be replaced any time you perform a new search.br Don't rely on it as a data store.  <comment266640> Interesting, but I can't get those shortcuts to work and it seems difficult to find any documentation on this feature. I can't see the beauty of find/replace using either the kill ring or the clipboard to store the data in though... <comment266641> http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/01/use-a-secondary-cut-and-paste-function-to-avoid-overwriting-clipboard-contents/
