Manually update tz (time zone) database in Mac OS X? <body> Is there a way to manually update the time zone definitions (“tz” database formerly known as the “Olson database“)?  For example, the Java platform provides the TZUpdater tool to install, and even build, a fresh copy of the tz data.   Is there some such tool or workaround for Mac OS X?  I know Apple tends to include updates to the tz database as a part of the regular system updates. But sometimes last minute changes are made to take effect sooner than Apple may release a system update. Also, for older versions of Mac OS X no longer updated by Apple may need fresh time zone data.  <answer227494> The FreeBSD location is   precode/usr/share/zoneinfo /code/pre  and the files are there on MacOSX 10.10.5. I'm not sure if updates to those files will be respected by OSX but it's a good place to start.
