Does Parallels 10 fix the Fn keys issue? <body> In order to use the kbdFn/kbd Keys on Windows VMs with Parallels 9 you have to set them as standard function keys on Mac OS, which requires you the press the kbdFn/kbd key to access the special functions (brightness, playback, volume etc.).  Does Parallels 10 fix this, allowing you to use the special keys on Mac and the F keys on Windows?  <answer177850> parallels can't 'fix' this issue, because the Fn+FKey combination is done in the keyboard itself, before being sent to the OS.  The Fn key itself does send a key code, but the combo doesn't.
