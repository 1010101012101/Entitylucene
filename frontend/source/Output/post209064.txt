How to trigger download of thumbnails of icloud photo library to iOS? <body> After uploading a large number of photos through the web upload of iCloud Photos my iOS does not show thumbnails of those new pictures but a grid of icons with small clouds in it.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x4tOU.jpg" alt="gridofclouds"br It has been like this since two days now. It seems the only way to get the thumbnails downloaded is to look at every picture on my iOS device.  Is there more efficient way to download thumbnails? (Preferably in the background)  <answer209072> The only way I have found is to click through each one. I usually start at the top and swipe through them, and they should start downloading.  <answer212440> Reactivating iCloud Foto library and immediately restarting the phone did the trick for me.   I deactivated iCloud Foto library and immediately activated it again. I then restarted the device (I killed the Foto app before deactivating and did not open it since then). After the restart, I opened the Foto app and charged my phone (make sure low power mode is off). I left it there for a couple of hours and suddenly, all thumbnails appeared. The same trick also works for keeping the originals if your phone won't download them until you open them.   <comment252141> Thanks, but I hope that there is another way implemented by Apple we haven't found yet. <comment252143> @rul30 nope, but you can suggest Apple fix it: apple.com/feedback
