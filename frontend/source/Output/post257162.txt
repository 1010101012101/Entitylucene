Cannot install Hamachi on macOS Sierra 10.12 <body> My Mac book won't let me install codehamachi/code or use some programs. The problem I tried to install says codehams.kext/code or codehamns.kext/code was installed incorrectly and told me to reinstall it, I tried looking into the web but no one has the same problem. How do I reinstall codehams.kext/code, codeHamns.kext/code? I waited 5 days for a response on my other article I made, but no response.  ul limacOS Sierra 10.12/li liMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012)/li liGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB/li /ul  <comment321013> Oh and this is the error log it gives me when i try to install hamachi. http://imgur.com/a/CAnCV <comment321014> Please provide the log as text it is unreadable <comment321015> Please visit the help center how to ask questions.
