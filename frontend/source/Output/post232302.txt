How to delete single songs in My Music without deleting them from playlists <body> When i create a playlist then i add some songs from Apple music. These songs are added also to "codeMy Music/code" as single songs. When i want to see only complete albums, it is impossible. I need to delete these single songs from "codeMy Music/code" somehow but when i delete a song it also deletes from my playlist  Anyone knows how to do that?  <answer232367> Unfortunately you cannot accomplish what you are attempting, and here's why:  The "My Music" section is essentially the master collection of all your music. The Playlists you create are simply sub-sections of that master list.  <comment283920> They added an option "Add songs to my music when you add them to playlist" it shows that it is possible to separate them. All i want is an option such as "Only show complete albums" in the "My Music" :/ <comment283936> As far as I know- and I've been using iTunes since day 1, that's never been an option. I've created album playlists as soon as I've imported a CD or purchased an album to guarantee seeing all an albums songs grouped together. <comment284012> So check this screenshot, this option came with the latest update - http://i65.tinypic.com/9039u9.png
