What are the Stages to a Connection in Safari? <body> The title pretty much says it all for this one; I'm interested to know what the exact procedure for connections in Safari is, i.e- the process that sees the progress bar move along until page is loaded.  In my specific case I'm hoping to determine why Safari keeps stalling at this point in a connection, or at least what point it's (sometimes) failing at:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qdRok.png" alt="Stalled connection"  At my screen resolution this is perhaps a fifth or a sixth of the way along. Working connections will often pause briefly at this stage before proceeding, but every so often I get a page that inexplicably sticks at this point a lot longer, or times out completely.  While I'm interested in what is happening specifically at that point, I think a more general answer that can fill in some of the other stages would be useful.  <comment236168> Have you tried using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org)? <comment236189> Pure guess would be DNS resolution/first response. For slow response at that point, especially if pages are zippy once they start to load, first 'fix' would be reboot the router & puter; 2nd would be to try another DNS
