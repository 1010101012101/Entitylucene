iTunes "Loved" tracks sporadically disappearing <body> I like to use the "love" feature on iTunes to keep track of my favorite tracks (which is useful when you have +33,000 songs) but this is the strongthird/strong time that they've just disappeared... emPOOF/em. Gone. I can't seem to replicate the bug either.  I'm sick and tired of re-loving songs, and am about ready to give up on the matter entirely. Does anyone know what is causing this? Does anyone have a solution?  If it helps, here is some info about my setup:  ul liMacBook Pro Retina, 13" Early 2015/li limacOS Siera 10.12.5/li liiPod Classic/li liiTunes 12.6.1.25, library stored on an external HDD/li /ul
