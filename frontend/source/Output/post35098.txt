What's the simplest way to password protect a text file? <body> I'd like to password protect a text file. Not necessarily a code.txt/code file - just a file that's got text in it that I can edit with a standard text editor. I'd like to set a password and be prompted for it every time I open the file in any app. What's the best way?  <answer35099> Assuming you're the file's owner, a built-in and system-wide way to do this would be to adjust the file's permissions so that only a specific user or users (I'm assuming you want to lock the file so only emyou/em can view/edit it) can read or write to the file.  As Mark pointed out in the comments, however, this only protects you if:  ul liNo other user has admin rights to the machine, and/li liNo one gains access to the machine while you're logged in/li /ul  Making Coconut Man's solution by far a better one. I'll leave this answer here as an alternative that may be helpful in similar situations.  <answer35101> You can put the file into an encrypted disk image.  ol liOpen "/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility"/li liFile  New  New Blank Image.../li liIn the new image dialog make sure to choose:  ul liEncryption = 128 or 256-bit AES/li liImage Format = read/write disk image/li /ul/li liBecause you chose encryption, you will be prompted to set a password for the disk image/li /ol  You now have a password-protected disk image that you can save any kind of file in.  <answer103436> You can print-save as PDF-password protect the PDF. It's not as transparent as having the .txt in a codeDMG/code, but it's easy enough to copy/paste the contents when it's time to edit.  Another container version akin to a codeDMG/code is codeOpenPGP/code. The suite for OS X is pretty nice, and it adds encrypt/decrypt to the services menu. It's very easy to right click your text file, choose 'Encrypt File' enter a password, verify, done.  Don't forget codeKeychain Access/code as well. It has the ability to create codeSecure Notes/code, which are password protected by the keychain they are stored in.  <comment40017> Even then anyone with admin rights or physical access to the machine can read the file (+ you need to be aware of how backups store the data) <comment40038> Brilliant and simple. Thank you! <comment40047> Good point! I'll edit my answer to describe it as an alternative with said limitations. <comment121735> These seem like great options. Will test them out!
