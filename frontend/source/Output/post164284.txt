Launchpad won't close in Mavericks on mid-2009 MBP <body> I tried to launch an app in Launchpad, and then couldn't leave. Here is a somewhat anonymized picture of the result.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uheNW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Launchpad faded somewhat, but not entirely, and remained active. I could nominally switch between applications and spaces, but the launchpad remained. I was able to type into a text field when I switched to an application, but not to click things within the application. The menu bar atop remained marginally active. I was unable to do what I needed to do, and force-quitting Finder with Command+Option+Escape didn't help. I eventually had to resort to restarting.  This happened to me once before, when I first installed Mavericks, and was trying to run it on 4 GB of RAM. I've since upgraded to 8 GB and wasn't anticipating dealing with this problem again.   strongWhat causes this error? What are my options?/strong  Thank you.  <comment192587> Did you try opening Launchpad again, while it was displaying the overlay? <comment192589> I've restarted since, and can't recall whether I tried to open it again or not. I believe I did make the hand gesture on the trackpad that usually dismisses it, in any event. <comment192592> It could be your graphics card acting up. Anything of interest in the Console log at the time of the event? <comment192849> Could the graphics card have also kept Launchpad active, though? I mean, I could switch between screens of Launchpad with swiping and click applications still when this was happening; I thought the graphics card would just affect what was visible on the screen. But I don't know much, in case you can't tell. I can only seem to get Console alerts back to 5:20 PM yesterday, for some reason. I don't really know much about the Console or how to interpret its output to search for interesting clues. What should my next step be?
