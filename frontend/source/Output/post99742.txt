OWC SSD speeds in mid-2012 MacBook Pro much lower than rated speeds <body> I have a MacBook Pro 15" mid-2012 (i7 2.6GHz, 16GB RAM, GT 650M 1GB). I installed OWC Mercury EXTREME Pro 6G SSD in the hard drive bay. I ran Blackmagic Disk Speed Test and got only 220 MB/s write speed and 460 MB/s read. OWC's website says they have 527 MB/s write and 559 MB/s read. So I am far far away from this. Does anyone have any idea what the problem could be?  <answer99754> Check to see what your Serial-ATA link speed is. You can find this in system profiler.   It will be something similar to this.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ejvHd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If your speed isn't 6 Gigabit but is 3 Gigabit then that would be why you aren't getting the speeds you'd expect.   <comment117390> I checked. Is exactly the same to this picture. 6 gigabit both. <comment117392> Are you running latest updates?
