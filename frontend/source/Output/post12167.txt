How can I automatically have my Trash emptied when disk space gets below a certain point? <body> Sometimes my hard drive gets low on space, and various things don't work properly until I empty the Trash and free up some space. I know there are applications that empty the Trash after a set intervalâ€”but what I want is an app or script (or other means) to empty the Trash whenever there's e.g. less than 2GB of free space on a given hard drive.  <answer12181> I use a third party preference pane Compost that deletes from trash when the disk fills up or if the file has been in trash for a given time.   The original download stopped working for me but I have just found this on the author's site instead of the distributer. Note the author's comment     Compost is in a bit of a state of flux right now. The distributor has moved on to a different market and we wish them well in their endeavors. Additionally, the changes necessary to fully support Snow Leopard have been going through an extensive beta period as a result of the degree and complexity of changes required. Please stay tuned for more information.   So it might not work even from this download  When I updated this I had just installed it on Yosemite and it installed (but not enough time to see if it deleted anything) I have now updated to El Capitan and the installer fails.  <answer12304> I use CleanMyMac, though there are lots of others that do a similar job. CleanMyMac also cleans cache, etc. Hazel is also good for cleaning out folders that fill up with rubbish quite frequently.  <answer26574> That's an interesting question.  I wrote a little shell script that will empty the trash if the available disk space falls before a threshold defined in the script (default is 10 GB but you can change that by editing the script).  h3Install script/h3  ol liDownload this: http://share.luo.ma/ase/12167/etilds.zsh/li liInstall it to code/usr/local/bin/etilds.zsh/code/li liThen do codechmod 755 /usr/local/bin/etilds.zsh/code/li /ol  h3Use launchd for automatic trash emptying/h3  If you want this to run automatically, I recommend launchd.

(10 more to go...) <comment82640> All the links are gone making this useless <comment82776> The links have been restored. I'm not sure why Dropbox stopped serving the old ones, but the new ones are on my own server, so they should be there for the foreseeable future. (If there is a better way to share files on ASE, please let me know.) <comment82899> You can include the files directly in your post, maybe shorten the .zsh script down to the essential 5 lines first (and keep the link to the long version). So the answer remains usable even if your site goes down/offline for whatever reason. <comment208492> For me it is "Hazel" that I use - wonderful automation tool. <comment284226> 3TB is now under $100. <comment284275> And yet (a) they're all still finite, and (b) none of them can be added to the current MacBook Pro.
