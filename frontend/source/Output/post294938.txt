How to make Apple Mail's behavior different for Reply-To? <body> I'm using Apple Mail on OS 10.8.5. when I get an email   From: person X To: mailing-list  and I hit "Reply", it doesn't reply to person X, it replies to the mailing list. I am perusing the mail headers, and see that this is because it has "Reply-To: mailing-list" set. How do I make Mail ignore that, and reply instead to the From address? I don't like it to default to replying to a whole list and have to manually change the To: field if you just want to reply to the sender.
