Mac drive not showing up on resetpassword screen <body> I am trying to reset my admin password using recovery partition. When I type coderesetpassword/code in terminal, a window shows up but I don't see my drive in the top box.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TSskC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to fix this? btw, I tried booting into single user mode, but it goes straight to the login page.  EDIT:  I may know why the drive doesn't show up. I checked codeDisk Utility/code and saw that the drive is locked. But I need a password to unlock it, which I don't have!  <answer180906> The drive is locked using FileVault encryption and cannot be accessed until you unlock the drive. This may be set to a master password of yours, and often is set a while back. You may want to try older passwords (or versions of them) to see if any of those work.  strongTo unlock the drive:/strong  ol liBoot into the recovery mode/li liLaunch Disk Utility/li liSelect the drive in disk utility/li liClick strongunlock/strong near the top of the disk utility window/li /ol  Unfortunately, the drive will not allow you to boot into those options and/or work on it until you pass the encryption lock. It emwill/em require a password or for you to completely erase the drive.  <comment215031> So this won't work without having the password. <comment215033> Correct. My steps only address the solution to the original problem, which is the drive not showing on the screen and the reason why the drive is locked. Beyond that, I cannot offer help for determining a lost filevault password beyond wiping the drive. <comment215049> @AliBZ If you don't have a valid password or the FileVault recovery key (or have stored the key with Apple), there's no way to get at the data on your hard disk. That's pretty much the purpose of FileVault.
