Missing Notification Center Widgets & Share Extensions <body> Half of my strongNotification Center/strong widgets (most importantly, strongWeather/strong) suddenly disappeared, and can no longer be added back by clicking strongEdit/strong at the bottom of the strongNotification Center/strong. Those that remain, like strongToday/strong and strongTomorrow/strong, show no information.  They are also missing from strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongExtensions/strong → strongToday/strong.  I’ve tried reinstalling the strongmacOS 10.12.3 Combo Update/strong, with no success through multiple reboots.  <answer274772> Apple has a knowledge base article for this bug occasionally affecting strongmacOS Yosemite/strong, strongEl Capitan/strong, and now strongSierra/strong. This happens most often after installing an OS update.  To reregister all strongNotification Center/strong widgets and Share Extensions, start a strongTerminal/strong session, and enter the following:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -seed /code/pre  (Triple-click the above line and press kbd⌘ cmd/kbdkbdc/kbd to copy, then kbd⌘ cmd/kbdkbdv/kbd inside strongTerminal/strong.)
