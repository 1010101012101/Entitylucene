Genius problems with iTunes and Match <body> I have iTunes (10.6 40) and Match on my mac, as soon as I enabled match my "genius" playlists no longer work.  If I click genius on a track that is playing it says:     Genius is unavailable for the song "Don't Drop It"   I click "Update Genius" and it says that the results have been updated, but never makes it available.  I have over 10K songs, so surely it can find a genius result for a G-Love or Jack Johnson song... but it never does.  Thanks.  <answer47494> Click the iCloud download icon to download the song to the computer you're using, and then try again.  An edit: This has only worked sporadically for me.  <comment56636> Cool.  This seems to work... at least sporadically for me.  I'll keep an eye on it.  If it seems to work over 60% I'll mark this as the answer.
