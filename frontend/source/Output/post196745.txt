Open Word Doc with Pages using Applescript <body> How can I get the following to work in Pages? I get an error message saying the file can't be opened but if I change the path to a code.pages/code file it works fine.  precodetell application "Pages"   activate   open "/tmp/test.docx" end tell /code/pre  <comment235101> I can open the file using the Pages open file dialog just fine. <comment235110> It worked okay for me.  This also works: `do shell script "open -a Pages /path_to/filename.docx"`
