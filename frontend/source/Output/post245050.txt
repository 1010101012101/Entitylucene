Google Now Traffic Information on iOS <body> The last 2 years I was a heavy Android user, trying to get the best out of my devices with the help of emrooting/em and emTasker/em. However, the weak stability and reliability of the devices (even if not rooted and without Tasker) drove me back to iOS (at least partially).  I was always a big fan of emGoogle Now/em, especially the commuting alerts. Therefore the emGoogle App/em is a emmust have/em for me. This morning there was a traffic jam towards work and my Android device, responsible for playing music in my car, announced that with a emGoogle Now Card/em. But my iPhone 6s was not showing any notifications: I had to open the app instead to see the card. This eliminates the advantage of the whole alerting.  I have some questions about this observation:  ol liIs Google Now on iOS not capable of pushing cards outside the App?/li liDo I have to enable emLocation Access Always/em for the Google App to do so? At the moment I prefer emWhile Using the App/em for battery reasons. If so, are a) the other Apps on the iPhone or b) other devices connected with my Google account not able to sync the demanded location data?/li /ol  <comment302061> The Google app on my iOS device gave a notification this morning that said "time to leave for xxxx" a while before a Google Calendar event with an attached location. I'm not sure if it always does this, or if it takes traffic into account. I am wondering myself. Google Now notifications have never worked very fluently on iOS, but maybe it's gotten better lately. I also have the Google Calendar app on my iOS device, which is linked to the "Google" app, in case it matters. I have it set to always track geolocation.
