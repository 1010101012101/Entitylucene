Can podcasts be grouped or organised in iTunes? <body> I have a lot of podcast subscriptions in iTunes that cause a long scrollbar. This is exacerbated when a subscription is expanded and available podcasts listed.  It would be great if I could just group podcasts by type (eg, music, comedy, documentaries etc). I've been unable to find a way of doing this myself. Is it at all possible?  <answer93858> No, the only way you can organize podcasts (and iTunes U content) is by title. These two libraries have different view settings than the others.  <comment110073> How disappointing! Thanks for answering, anyway.
