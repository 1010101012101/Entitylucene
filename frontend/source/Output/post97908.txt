changed user path and lost aliases in .bash_profile <body> I reinstalled mountain lion recently and had to reset my git path. Everything was working fine until I realised I had to do it for every project so I tried to change the default system path by codesudo bash -c '( echo /usr/local/git/bin &gt; /etc/paths.d/git )'/code   Apparently I should have left it alone as I don't really know what I'm doing. My command prompt is now codeunknown-00-26-bb-0e-a8-1f:~ mantismamita$/code (mantismamita is my username so that part is normal) and I have lost access to my aliases located in code.bash_profile/code I'm also back to square one with my original problem as my git path is no longer correct. I should mention that I'm at a different IP address as I'm on holiday so that may have influenced the prompt.   I would be eternally grateful if someone could help me get out of this muddle.   <answer97963> I think these are not related. What you're seeing is the default bash prompt, which is defined in /etc/bashrc:  precode$ grep PS1=  /etc/bashrc PS1='\h:\W \u\$ ' /code/pre  From the bash man page:  precode \h     the hostname up to the first `.'  \u     the username of the current user  \W     the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde /code/pre  What's happened is that your hostname is not being set correctly. It related to your network settings. It was discussed on superuser: https://superuser.com/questions/318509/hostname-issue-in-mac-os-x-lion  And on the /etc/paths.d/git file, what you did is correct. If you have git installed in /usr/local/git/bin, then the install usually creates that file for you. But the contents are trivial, so you can create it yourself. It should have a single line, containing the path to the bin directory you want added to PATH for all users:  precode$ ls -l /etc/paths.d/git -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  19 Sep 17  2009 /etc/paths.d/git $ od -ta /etc/paths.d/git 0000000    /   u   s   r   /   l   o   c   a   l   /   g   i   t   /   b 0000020    i   n  nl 0000023 $ wc -l /etc/paths.d/git    1 /etc/paths.d/git $ cat /etc/paths.d/git /usr/local/git/bin /code/pre  <comment114911> You need to restore /etc/paths.d/git from a backup or update OSX from the combo update as you have overwritten the Apple supplied file. The command should have had  rather than  <comment114916> so I could just run the combo update here : http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1659 ? Or would I have to do something to restore the original path? <comment114918> There is no `/etc/paths.d/git` on a plain installation so `` or `` doesn't matter. I'm quite sure that the problem doesn't relate to the git path thing. Do you have network environments defined in Preferences? <comment114921> no, the network I'm on is listed under system preferences but I haven't done anything to define it. Then again, I never had problems with my aliases other times I switched networks. <comment115065> Thanks Tim, I've changed networks again as I'm visiting some friends but everything seems to be back in working order.
