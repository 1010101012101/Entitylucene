Extracting latency value from output of ping <body> I am trying to pull a latency value from a ping with the following command:  codeping -c 1 206.190.36.45 | awk -F" |=" '/time/{print $10"ms YH"}'/code  But I want to remove the digits after the code./code  So instead of code282.117ms US/code  I would like to see code282ms US/code  What needs to be added to the command to do so?   <answer222657> There are probably hundred of ways to accomplish this with standard Unix tools. To list just some of them:  precode# extending what you have ping -c 1 206.190.36.45 | awk -F" |=" '/time/{print $10"ms YH"}' | sed -e 's/\..*ms/ms/  # using awk only ping -c 1 206.190.36.45 | awk -F" |=" '/time/{printf "%i%s\n", $10, "ms YH"}'  # using sed instead ping -c 1 206.190.36.45 | sed -n '/time=/s/.*time=\(.*\)\..*/\1ms YH/p'  # a rather different approach (just for the fun of it, not really recommended) echo "$(ping -c 1 206.190.36.45 | fgrep time= | cut -d= -f 4 | cut -d. -f 1)ms YH" /code/pre
