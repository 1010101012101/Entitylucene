How to copy and paste Javascript code from a PDF file to a texteditor (Textmate or Sublime Text) <body> Everytime, I want to copy and paste one Javascript code example from a book (in a pdf version) to Sublime Text or Textmate, any " " become “ ”  the code doesn't work.   Is there any way to fix this ?  Thanks in advance.  Config: OSX Lion, PDF reader : Skim  Update : for Textmate : the solution is here : http://goo.gl/3r3xI  <answer38336> That's probably because the PDF uses actual curly quotation marks (which are indeed syntactically incorrect). The most straightforward thing to do would be performing a search and replace on the copied text in your text-editor.  <answer38394> Some text editors like BBEdit or TextWrangler have a built-in command to straighten so-called "smart" quotes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iAyNf.png" alt="enter image description here"  It does not appear the the two text editors you cite as examples have built-in commands for this, so either search and replace or a plugin is the solution.  <comment43418> Thanks. The curly quotation marks look like as quotation marks in the PDF. <comment43430> I'm pretty sure this is all down to using Microsoft Word as a document source due to its "Smart quotes", but the quotes as they appear in the PDF will look different depending on the font used <comment43699> Thanks for the info. I founded 2 commands for Textmate that solve the problem. I wish i could could find one for sublime text 2.
