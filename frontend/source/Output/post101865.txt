How to resolve issue of help shortcut key (Cmd + Shift + /) not working? <body> I really like the shortcut key to bring up the help menu (codeCmd + Shift + //code). I use it navigate the menus by typing in short words.  However, I've just noticed that it's not currently working. Instead, I get an error noise whenever I press codecmd+shift+//code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDqT1.png" alt="enter image description here"  My first thoughts was that either another program is intercepting the shortcut in a global way. But I don't what that program might be.  ul listrongHow can diagnose the cause of this shortcut key failure (Cmd+Shift+/)?/strong/li listrongHow can I resolve the problem?/strong/li /ul  strongUPDATE:/strong  ul liI tried changing the shortcut key in "keyboard shortcuts" to something else (e.g., codeCmd + Alt + Shift + //code). This alternate keyboard shortcut also triggers the error noise. So this suggests that the problem is not a conflict with another program./li /ul  <answer101868> @sameetandpotatoes made some great suggestions.   ul liI tried a different shortcut key for triggering the help menu and still had the problem./li liRestarting OSX resolved the problem./li /ul  <comment119982> Have you tried other shortcuts? Do they work? Have you tried hard resetting? <comment120008> You should mark your answer as accepted (even though it won't fetch you any reputation points) so that others can ignore this question (or learn from it). :) <comment120021> will do in a couple of days when self-accepting is permitted.
