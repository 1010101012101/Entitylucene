iWork Numbers increase column size for sum <body> If I have columns that sum at the bottom, how can I have the sum function automatically include a newly inserted row.  precode    a   +---+ 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 |   +---+   |=sum(a1:a4)| /code/pre  Then when I add row 5 the sum function should be  precode=sum(a1:a5) /code/pre  <answer76173> This functionality is embedded and its default behaviour. Of course if adding a row will be done using this option:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/px0m9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment88456> The function will only be updated when a row was inserted into the middle between a1 and a4, but it does not work when I add a row after a4. <comment88470> Number '09 does, I've checked it twice. <comment89321> Was the answer useful? <comment89375> It does work. I have to add the row below the last row in the group. I was attempted to add a new row above the sum function. <comment89376> I edited your answer to be more correct. Thank you.
