How to open a URL without launching a new safari tab? <body> I would like to write a script (AppleScript or shell script) to open a URL such as  precodehttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/station/beats-1/idra.978194965 /code/pre  which then launches iTunes and play a radio station.   The problem is that all the commands I found will first open a Safari tab and then redirect to iTunes for the playback.   Is there a way to not have an empty Safari tab/window left after launching this URL?   <answer242498> Replace your link with this one:  precodeitms://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRadioStation?id=ra.978194965 /code/pre  You can open it without open your safari. Of course, only works with iTunes installed.
