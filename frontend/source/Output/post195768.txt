Minecraft Immediately Crashes On Launchup <body> I'm running Mavericks 10.9.5.br This is my java version:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VN9Oy.png" alt="http://prntscr.com/7s9xnw"  Whenever I started Minecraft up, it would immediately crash.  I tried:    ul liReinstalling Minecraft  /li liDeleting the minecraft folder in Application Support  /li liReinstalling Java/li /ul  Hints for the problem:  ul liDownloaded the most recent Java. Version 8 Update 45./li liRan this command in terminal:/li /ul  hr  precodesudo mv /usr/bin/java /usr/bin/java-1.6 /code/pre  ul liRan this command in terminal: /li /ul  hr  precodesudo ln -s '/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/ContentÂ­s/Home/bin/java' /usr/bin/java /code/pre  I was having troubles with running a plugin, so I thought it was my java. After I did all of that, java wouldn't work at all. I tried to enter "java -version" in terminal, and it would say "unknown command".  After that happened, I went to Apple Java, and installed the most recent build, found here: https://support.apple.com/downloads/java  I installed "Java for OS X 2015-001 Beta.  After that, I could type in "java -version" with no problem. After I restarted my computer, Minecraft wouldn't launch. When I try to run my own server, it starts up, and then it fails and crashes.  Note: Java Control Panel also crashes on launch.  <answer269726> Have you tried to Delete Minecraft on your computer and reinstalling it? (Not sure if you need to buy it again)  <comment233783> Anyone?
