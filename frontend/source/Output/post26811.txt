Truly Minimize All Windows <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How to minimize all windows/applications to the dock?       I am aware of the F11 shortcut, but that doesn't really minimize all windows - it moves them to different corners and then when I open something up they ALL come back. The closest thing I have to making this work is by pressing F11, then Command + Option + Desktop click.  Are there any easier ways?   <answer26816> Try the Finder keyboard shortcut Option-Command-M. Other very handy shortcuts are available on this article at the Apple Support site. Hope this helps.   <answer26821> Click on desktop area (or just switch Finder) then just hit CMD+ALT+H.  <comment30595> That just seems to minimize my current window. <comment30596> ... and all windows associated with that program. For example, having two Google Chrome windows open will minimize both of them, but not Xcode, for example. <comment30599> Is the goal for the windows to be truly minimized (i.e. there are thumbnail icons in the Dock ready to be clicked to reappear), or for them to semi-permanantly go away (like with F11 but where they don't come flying back when you open something)? <comment30600> Is there no easy way to do this without having to do multiple clicks/shortcuts? <comment30609> Either/or, really. I'm not THAT picky. ;) <comment30614> I think you can create an app with Automator (https://skitch.com/fatihturan/f6th7/automator) and run this app with BetterTouchTool or something like this (http://www.boastr.de/) via keyboard binding. <comment30638> tell application "System Events"  set theButtons to {}    repeat with theApplication in application processes   repeat with theWindow in windows of theApplication    repeat with theButton in buttons of theWindow     if ((description of theButton) is "minimize button") then      set theButtons to theButtons & {theButton}     end if    end repeat   end repeat  end repeat    repeat with theButton in theButtons   click theButton  end repeat end tell
