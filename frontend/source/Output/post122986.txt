How Can I Log Crontab File Writes <body> I'm looking for a way to log crontab file writes. A friend of mine pranked me, and did something that occasionally adds code*/5 * * * * say "deranged" "The current time is `date`"/code  I haven't been able to identify a pattern yet: Nothing for 2 weeks, then twice in 5 minutes. I'm trying to find the process that writes to the crontab. Is there any way to log crontab writes to a file so I can catch this thing?  <answer122990> Open terminal and run this:  precodesudo fs_usage | grep cron /code/pre  I'd run it using tmux or screen so that you can detach and check later. Depending on how many cron jobs you have, this could generate a lot of messages and you'll want to not run it where a runaway process could cause harm. (backup, check filesystems for space, etc...)  You can also use codemdfind/code to see if you can locate the file/script/package that is calling crontab (perhaps) and correlate that with the times when the actual filesystem changes are happening.  precodemdfind crontab /code/pre  <comment143560> Is your [friend named Moshen](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/95171/how-do-i-use-say-command-creatively-to-prank-my-coworkers-friends)? <comment143739> No luck with mdfind. It's happening more frequently now, so fs_usage will likely return something soon. <comment143741> Nope :). It's not on system restart or any common terminal arguments.
