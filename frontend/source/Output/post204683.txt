Preview hangs when I try to change a PDF <body> The codePreview/code app hangs whenever I try to edit a PDF/adding text in fields.  I try to repair the permissions/reboot but it doesn't change the behavior.  Here's the console messages:  precode07/09/2015 10:32:30,417 Preview[1163]: -filterInputEvent: is deprecated and will be going away soon. 07/09/2015 10:32:33,320 Preview[1163]: *** setObjectForKey: object cannot be nil (key: NSFont) 07/09/2015 10:32:33,322 Preview[1163]: (     0   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff95df203c __exceptionPreprocess + 172     1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00007fff8786576e objc_exception_throw + 43     2   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff95cd8c66 -[__NSDictionaryM setObject:forKey:] + 1174     3   AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f308a84 +[AKTextAnnotationAttributeHelper typingAttributes:byApplyingScaleFactor:] + 304     4   AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f3bee8a -[AKTextEditorController _beginEditingAnnotation:withPageController:selectAllText:] + 1163     5   AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f3bf95e -[AKTextEditorController _performBlockOnMainThread:] + 81     6   AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f3be7fc -[AKTextEditorController beginEditingAnnotation:withPageController:selectAllText:] + 167     7   AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f3556b6 -[AKMainEventHandler handleDoubleDownEvent:withOptionalTouches:] + 324     8   AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f354988 -[AKMainEventHandler handleDownEvent:withOptionalTouches:] + 844     9   AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f3540e0 -[AKMainEventHandler mainHandleEvent:withOptionalTouches:] + 1562     10  AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f32f838 -[AKMainEventHandler_Mac mainHandleEvent:withOptionalTouches:] + 336     11  AnnotationKit                       0x000000010f32f60d __45-[AKMainEventHandler_Mac initWithController:]_block_invoke + 59     12  AppKit                              0x00007fff8ab62cc7 _NSSendEventToObservers + 335     13  AppKit                              0x00007fff8ab60882 -[NSApplication sendEvent:] + 56     14  Preview                             0x000000010f094821 Preview + 10273     15  AppKit                              0x00007fff8aa8ab68 -[NSApplication run] + 711     16  AppKit                              0x00007fff8aa07244 NSApplicationMain + 1832     17  libdyld.dylib                       0x00007fff9602a5c9 start + 1 ) 07/09/2015 10:32:42,138 Preview[1163]: Page bounds {{0, 0}, {400, 400}} 07/09/2015 10:32:42,164 Preview[1163]: -[AKFormFeatureDetector dealloc] /code/pre  It emseems/em that it's related to the font but I don't know how to fix it. How can I do that?  <comment246831> I reported a similar bug to apple recently. It was caused by my using a font I installed myself in preview (w/ the text box tool), then uninstalling the font, then trying to use Preview again. Preview was still looking for this font I had uninstalled, could not find it, and crashed repeatedly. It looks like maybe this is your case, when trying to annotate a PDF. If you can, try to see if there's a font missing, perhaps, that you can install again, and see if that helps.
