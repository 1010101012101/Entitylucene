iPhone 5s is switching itself off when I'm not working on it <body> My iPhone 5s is always is switching itself off when I'm not working on it.  I always used to switch it on by pressing the Home button and the Power button together. After some days the problem got worse and now its not getting on at all, so I repaired it by restoring the software but it didn't work, still.  A repairing place said it doesn't have a battery problem either. What are the other problems an iPhone can get related to this and how can I fix it?  <comment248676> What iOS version are you running?
