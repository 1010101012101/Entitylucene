Find my iPhone email on login <body> Before, Apple would send an email when my Apple ID was used to login to Find my i iPhone on another device. Did Apple take away the email notification when your Apple ID is used to login to Find my iPhone?  <answer207023> I believe you now just can look over the connected devices when you wish at:  ul lihttps://www.icloud.com/#settings/li /ul  The mails are still sent when you remove a device, but I don't recall getting the sign on ones anymore.  <comment249645> The email arrives when you log into an appleid from an unrecognized device, or if you play a sound, or set lost mode from findmyiphone.  Logging on from a "recognized" device and tracking the iPhone via findmyiphone will not generate an email.
