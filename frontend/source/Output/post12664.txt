Date of Download <body> When I download an item, I would like the modified date to be the date the item was downloaded. Is this possible somehow?  <answer12698> It is possible.  You can change the modified date of a file using this command  precodetouch -mt YYYYMMDDhhmm /code/pre  where YYYYMMDDhhmm is the date/time you'd like to set it for.  Combined with the Add Folder Actions (where you can assign an Applescript that runs when a file is added to a folder), you should be able to create an Applescript to do this (using the touch command above).
