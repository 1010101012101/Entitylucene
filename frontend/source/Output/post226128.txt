Check if G5 is a SMP one? <body> How do I check if a G5 PPC mac has 2 CPUs or not?  When booting it up under Linux (Debian 8) only one CPU seems to be detected:  precodecat /proc/cpuinfo  processor   : 0 cpu     : PPC970FX, altivec supported clock       : 1800.000000MHz revision    : 3.0 (pvr 003c 0300)  timebase    : 33333333 platform    : PowerMac model       : PowerMac9,1 machine     : PowerMac9,1 motherboard : PowerMac9,1 MacRISC4 Power Macintosh  detected as : 337 (PowerMac G5) pmac flags  : 00000000 L2 cache    : 512K unified pmac-generation : NewWorld /code/pre  And the kernel should support SMP:  precodeuname -a Linux g5 3.16.0-4-powerpc64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u3 (2016-01-17) ppc64 GNU/Linux /code/pre  Does an SMP G5 Macs has 2 heat sinks installed - or is it one big one?  Is there perhaps a OpenFirmware command that lists the CPU details?  <answer226131> I'm not sure about OpenFirmware commands, but your PowerMac G5 only has 1 processor since it's a 9,1. I'll edit this later if I can find any. It looks like it's possible in Single User Mode, but I'm not sure about via OpenFirmware.  <answer226136> Considering these two pieces of information  precodeprocessor   : 0 cpu         : PPC970FX /code/pre  It looks like there is only one physical CPU installed and it is a single-core.  I tried finding out if the motherboard supports two physical CPUs but came up empty:  precodemotherboard : PowerMac9,1 MacRISC4 Power Macintosh  /code/pre  Hopefully some Mac hardware gurus are floating around here that are familiar with that board :)  hr  The reason I say the CPU is single-core is because Wikipedia states:     The 970MP is a dual-core derivative of the 970FX   <comment274566> Single User mode still requires a viable OS X boot - so booting to OS X would get you CPU information as easily as single user. <comment274573> @bmike Sadly, yes. I included it anyways since it was the best I could find at the time. <comment274574> One should be able to display the device tree in the OpenFirmware environment (cf. e.g. [this guide](http://mac.linux.be/content/guide-open-firmware-apple-bios-0)). And the device tree should be pretty accurate, I presume. This device tree is also accessible under Linux, i.e. under `/proc/device-tree` - and there the `/proc/device-tree/cpus/` directory only contains 1 CPU and `cat /proc/device-tree/model` also yields `PowerMac9,1`. <comment274575> @maxschlepzig Sounds like a solution!
