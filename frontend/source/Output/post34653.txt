Why isn't my iPod touch's calendar showing up in iCloud? <body> I have enabled iCloud for my iPod touch and enabled Calendar sync, but my calendar events aren't showing up in iCloud when I login, even after I've manually backed it up to iCloud. What's the problem?  <answer34680> I had a similar problem with an iPad Calendar that wouldn't sync with [e.g., appear on] my other devices.  I found this link helpful:  http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=13675190&amp;postcount=9  In my case, I turned off iCloud Calendar syncing on the iPad [in iCloud settings].  I then chose to emkeep/em the Calendar data on the iPad rather than delete it.  Next, I turned iCloud Calendar syncing back on in iCloud settings, chose Merge, and bingo, everything appeared everywhere.    Hope this helps.  <comment39603> Thanks! Will definitely try this. <comment39621> What version of iOS is your iPod touch running? Did you do your iCloud configuration from within Mac OS X or iTunes, or from within the system settings on the iPod touch? <comment39676> @Wheat It's running iOS 5. I set up iCloud from the iPod touch. <comment43363> I'm pretty sure this worked. Thanks for your answer!
