Why does my network drive automount at startup? <body> h1Background/h1  I have a network drive that I want to keep mounted all the time for Plex. I've created an entry in code/etc/auto_master/code for it and that's working as expected.  The issue that I'm having is that when I restart the computer, it's mounted twice: once at code/Volumes/Video/code and once at code~/Plex/Video/code (my custom location). I'd like to remove the one in code/Volumes/code.  h1Question/h1  I've looked in the Login Items in System Preferences, but it's not in there. Where else could a "Mount this drive at startup" setting be stored?  I'm on macOS Sierra (10.12.1).
