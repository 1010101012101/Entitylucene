Emails sent twice in Mail <body> When I answer to an email in the Mail app, I noticed that the email is always sent twice. The first email sent is ok, the problem only occurs for the answers. I don't get this problem for the emails I receive, though, so maybe the emails I send are not sent twice, but they are displayed twice.  What should I do to solve this little problem ?  Thank you very much.  <comment290595> What leads you to believe the emails are being sent twice? Are you getting any error messages? <comment290622> I'm not getting any error message, it's just that, when I click on an email exchange to read it, I can see that the answers I sent are displayed twice.
