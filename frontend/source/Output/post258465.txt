Keychain management command-line utility <body> br I'am trying to fully automate the process strongFileVault/strong setup on multiple OS X user machines.br E.g. to have a Bash script as a result.br One of the steps is codeInstitutional Recovery Key (IRK)/code generation. This key is required to access encrypted hard disk without user credentials.br The generation command codesudo security create-filevaultmaster-keychain/code create a public-private key pair.brbr But only the public one must be installed on the user machine.br I can delete it using codeKeychain Access/code utility.br But this is a GUI utility and cannot be called from the Bash.brbr So, how can i remove the private key from the keychain-file from the emcommand line/em?br  Or maybe there are already working scripts for this task :)  P.S. I've already read this but find no answer:br IRK managementbr security command man  <answer258585> Type "man fdesetup" in the terminal app on your mac. Read the document.  <answer258766> I haven't tried recovering data with it yet but I think the following works:  precodesecurity create-filevaultmaster-keychain ~/Desktop/FileVaultMaster.keychain  security export -k ~/Desktop/FileVaultMaster.keychain -t certs -o ~/Desktop/FileVaultMasterPublic.cer  sudo fdesetup changerecovery -institutional -certificate ~/Desktop/FileVaultMasterPublic.cer /code/pre  In my case FileVault was already enabled so I just added it after the fact.  <comment323112> You may have missed something in the [IRK management](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/08/13/filevault-2-institutional-recovery-keys-creation-deployment-and-use/) link. Have a look at: [fdesetup(8)](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/fdesetup.8.html) <comment323137> What exactly i've missed here? Sorry, i'm newbie in Mac and FileVault :( <comment323138> Did you go back and reread the article and read the man page for fdesetup(8)? <comment323305> Telling people to RTFM might be considered rude or at least not very helpful, especially for a Mac newbie. Can you at least indicate which part/option the OP should look at (or even cite it in your answer)? <comment323317> Hmm, do you suggest ` fdesetup enable -certificate mycertfile.cer` option? and CER-file can be created using `sudo security create-filevaultmaster-keychain`? <comment323318> @patrix Thanks for support! Looks like i should use `-certificate` option. However i must understand that a certificate Apple means first <comment323756> Nice solution - just export certificate for further using! However, looks like there is no tool to remove private key... <comment347058> I didn't use the term RTFM but I sincerely hope you were not offended@BughunterExtreme If you were, my humble apologies.
