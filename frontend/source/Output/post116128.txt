How to print and email PDF from any OS X application on PDF letterhead? <body> On the Windows PC there is a nice eDocPrinter PDF printer driver from Iteksoft that prints from any Windows application to a PDF file overlayed with a PDF of the corporate letterhead and even attaches the result to a new mail message in the default mail client.  Regression  ul liThe Automator.app in 10.8.5 doesn't seem to overlay PDF files, Automater.app only overlays image file formats./li liThere is a PDF printer driver project at sourceforge which doesn't overlay and doesn't e-mail./li liThen there is the PDF Letterhead app, which isn't a printer driver, loses it's settings on every quit and requires the creation of an intermediate temporary PDF file because this isn't a printer driver./li /ul  Who can give a hint how to create an new mail message having a PDF document attached that is overlayed with a PDF letterhead using the Mac OS X print dialog?  <answer205723> The latest version of PDF Letterhead in App Store keeps its settings. You can also choose "Open in PDF Letterhead" from the Print Menu. This saves you from creating a temporary PDF file.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-letterhead/id976548033?mt=12  <comment274859> I've tried the new version that mipmip mentioned and it's working like a charm. Just what I was looking for! Cheers!
