How do I open a new Terminal window ssh'ed to another machine from the command line? <body> From the command line I'd like to open a new Terminal window that is already SSH'ing to a host.  From the command line, I can open a new Terminal window very easily:  precodeopen -a Terminal /code/pre  or  precodeopen -a Terminal /path/name /code/pre  (The second one starts the Terminal already "cd"'ed to /path/name.)  However I want the Terminal to open and immediately run "ssh foo" instead.  <answer202165> As far as I know, you can't do it using codeopen/code command.   But, you can do it using a combination of keyboard shortcuts and Terminal profiles.   Define a new profile on your Terminal app (let's call it ssh) and add your ssh command on strongShell/strong tab under strongRun command:/strong.  Then your can define a shortcut on strongSystem Preferences/strong - strongKeyboard/strong - strongShorcuts/strong - strongApp Shortcuts/strong like the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mIv9s.png" alt="enter image description here"  Once done, you will have to type the shortcut on your Terminal app and will open a new window with your codessh/code command.  Careful, the Menu Title must have the exact same name as your newly created profile.
