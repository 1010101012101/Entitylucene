OS X - how to check if installer is signed <body> I'm creating installer for my application using pkgbuild and using certificate to sign it. Is there any command which would verify that created .pkg file is really signed (I mean - OS X will install it without saying that it comes from unidentified developer)? I would like to use this command as testing step in automated workflow.     <answer212336> You can use codepkgutil --check-signature YOUR.pkg/code. Sample output:  precodePackage "Silverlight.pkg":    Status: signed by a certificate trusted by Mac OS X    Certificate Chain:     1.
