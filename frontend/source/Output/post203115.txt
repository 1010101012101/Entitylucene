Installed openvpn with brew but it doesn't appear to be installed correctly <body> I installed codeopenvpn/code with codebrew/code. The installation went fine, no errors or missing dependencies. But now when I try to run it:  precodeusers-MBP:~ user$ brew install openvpn Warning: openvpn-2.3.7 already installed users-MBP:~ user$ openvpn -bash: openvpn: command not found /code/pre  I based myself on this tutorial: https://my.hostvpn.com/knowledgebase/29/OpenVPN-on-Mac-OS-X-via-Homebrew-CLI.html  <answer203177> At the terminal type:  precodeecho $PATH  /code/pre  That's your default search path for executables.  Looks like the openvpn executable was installed someplace not in your search path.  First, you'll need to find the openvpn executable:  precodesudo find / -type f -name "openvpn"  /code/pre  Then add the directory containing the openvpn executable to your default search path by adding this sort of line to the end of your .profile (in your home directory, a.k.a. /Users/yourusername/.profile:  precodeexport PATH="/some/brew/dir:$PATH" /code/pre  <answer233221> Add this to your code~/.bash_profile/code:  precodeexport PATH=$(brew --prefix openvpn)/sbin:$PATH /code/pre  <answer240337> You have to add code/usr/local/sbin/code to your path.  It was installed to code/usr/local/sbin/code but that directory is not in your code$PATH/code by default. Add a line like this to your code~/.bashrc/code or equivalent:  precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:$PATH /code/pre  <answer245001> You can also add a symlink from usr/local/sbin into usr/local/bin like so:  precodecd /usr/local/bin ln -s ../sbin/openvpn . /code/pre  <answer271885> In my case:  ol liInstallation using homebrew     brew install openvpn /li liInformation regarding binaries     brew info openvpn /li liIt gave me installation path as:     /usr/local/Cellar/openvpn/2.4.0 /li liThen I browsed for codebin/code directory but found executable inside codesbin/code. So, I added following line     codeexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/openvpn/2.4.0/sbin/code /li /ol  in my code~/.zshrc/code file as well as in code~/.bash_profile/code file using a text editor.  Worked Flawlessly, After a workaround for an hour :)  <answer274136> I was having same issue today and I had to do codesudo brew services start openvpn/code  <comment244988> Out of curiosity, why did you not choose to go with [TunnelBlick](https://tunnelblick.net)? <comment244991> @agentroadkill After some time on Linux I have a strong preference for command-line tools over GUIs. Whenever possible I try to go for a CLI solution. <comment244992> I believe TunnelBlick is fully configurable from command line, though I rarely use it as I generally use it for simplistic end-user functions. <comment244994> @agentroadkill I may look into it. `openvpn` also has the advantage of being the same tool I used on Linux for the job so I could just copy over my configuration files, same commands etc... But I will look into TunnelBlick if I can't get it working. <comment244995> TunnelBlick is just an OpenVPN client for MacOS. Any OpenVPN config generated for Linux and/or Windows can be used with it. <comment295421> what is the output of which -a openvpn ? - if it's empty then you don't have the path where openvpn is installed inside your $PATH Environment Variable <comment327279> `brew info openvpn` is faster
