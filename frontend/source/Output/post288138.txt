FATAL:as: I don't understand 'm' flag! error when compiling using gfortran <body> I have installed gfortran on my laptop, running macOS Sierra 10.12. I was trying to compile a simple "hello world" program, and I was given the following error:     FATAL:/opt/local/bin/../libexec/as/x86_64/as: I don't understand 'm' flag!   This error doesn't occur when I use gcc to compile. It only seems to happen for gfortran.  Following a suggestion given here (While installing on OSX Sierra via gcc-6, keep having “FATAL:/opt/local/bin/../libexec/as/x86_64/as: I don't understand 'm' flag!” error) I temporarily removed /opt/local/bin from PATH, and things started working fine.  However, I would like a more permanent fix, but I don't want to remove /opt/local/bin from PATH permanently. The answer also suggested forcing the use of "as" that comes with Xcode, but I don't really know how one would do this.  <comment363815> How did you install `gfortran`? Is it part of MacPorts, or distinct? <comment363820> I got the same message when I tried running my fortran code from Sublime Text and Atom. Both used gfortran. I went to a different IDE and it works fine. Again using gfortran. So I don't think its a gfortran issue but an issue with whatever calls and runs it.
