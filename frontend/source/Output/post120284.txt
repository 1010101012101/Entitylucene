Find and replace with grep and perl <body> I'd like to grep and replace specific text in textfiles within a directory and all subdirs.  I try the following:  precodels -R | egrep '.*\.txt' | perl -i -p -e 's/one.a/two.a/g' /code/pre  Although grep spits out a list and this executes, I can't seem to get perl to actually write to the files.  If possible, I'm interested in learning how to do this without the use of codefind/code.  Can anyone spot where I'm going wrong?  Thanks, jml  <answer120286> There are two minor issues:  First, to pipe file names to a perl one-liner in this way, you need to use the xargs command.    Second, you will need to pass the full path to the perl one-liner, because it might be in a subdir, so it would be better to use codefind/code.  Here's a working command:  precodefind . -name "*.txt" | xargs perl -i -p -e 's/one.a/two.a/g' /code/pre  <comment140299> can i not do this with ls / grep? <comment140412> It's not impossible to get full path's including recursive subdirs from `ls`, but `find` is much simpler.
