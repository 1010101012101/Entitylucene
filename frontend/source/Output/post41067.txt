How to access Windows share from an iPad? <body> I didn't find any iPad app that's supporting samba.  What is the best way to access Windows shares from an iPad?  <answer41072> Because there is no normally-accessible local filesystem on an iOS device, an app that "supports SMB" doesn't tell us enough. Because you can't simply copy files from a SMB share onto the iOS device.  There are plenty of apps that support SMB shares, three I can think of off the top of my head (at least as far as I recall) are: Goodreader, OPlayer, and Air Sharing.  Air Sharing is probably the most compatible for whatever you want to do, as it opens almost anything. Goodreader is primarily a document reader (txt, pdf, etc.), and OPlayer is a multi-format video player. It plays almost anything, MPEGs, AVIs, MKVs, etc.  What you want to accomplish beyond merely 'connecting to a SMB Share' will dictate the app you'll be able to use.  <answer41076> It's easy to hook up dropbox--not quite the same as you are asking but supported on pc/mac/iphone/ipad/android/linux/... and really does a great job of syncing your files together.   I haven't seen any other apps that would allow you to accomplish the goal you are after, but you will find some that will let you stream media from a certain type of media share--but that's not what you asked.  <answer41494> Additionally to the OPlayer app suggested by @Jason Salaz I've found several other apps that can connect to Windows smb shares:   ul liCloud Connect Pro $14.99/li liFileBrowser $3.99/li liFiles Connect $3.99/li liNetPortal $2.39/li liezShare Pro $15.99/li /ul  Unfortunately I couldn't find any free apps.   <comment47049> Thank you! OPlayer supports connecting to Samba Windows shares. In Goodreader and Air Sharing I didn't find such functions. <comment48883> The apps I've posted above allow accessing Windows shares. <comment65521> How do you use an SMB share in GoodReader?
