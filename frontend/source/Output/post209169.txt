What happens if I edit a duplicate Hosts file? <body> What exactly is a duplicate file?  When I wanted to edit the hosts file (code/private/etc/hosts/code), it says:     You don't own the file "hosts" and donâ€™t have permission to write to   it.      You can duplicate this document and edit the duplicate. Only the duplicate will include your changes.   So, if I do my edits in the duplicate codehosts/code file, is it equivalent to having my hosts file edited?  <answer209172> This is a poorly chosen vocabulary since in a MacOS X file system a strongduplicate/strong is a serious error meaning that the file-system is deeply corrupted.  The correct term which should have been used here is the term of strongcopy/strong.  If you don't have permission to edit code/private/etc/hosts/code then make a local strongcopy/strong as follows:  precodecp /private/etc/hosts ~/hosts /code/pre  If you really need to edit the code/private/etc/hosts/code, I advise you to make first a backup local strongcopy/strong as above. And once you have edited and thoroughly verified it, put it back into place with codesudo/code to get the admin priviledges:  precode/usr/bin/sudo cp ~/hosts /private/etc/hosts /code/pre  <answer209178> The Hosts file is not owned by any user, it is owned by System (root). The standard way to edit it is to drag a copy to the desktop, edit that, then drag it back &amp; authenticate. Then you need to change the owner back to root.  To avoid all this fiddling around, you could use GasMask (freeware), which allows you to edit, copy [duplicate] &amp; keep multiple hosts files, instantly switchable.  <comment252343> I've changed the title of this question to "What happens if I edit a duplicate Hosts file?" which might bring future Googlers to it more easily. Please feel free to edit further, or revert my change if you are not happy with it. <comment252344> @Tetsujin Looks appropriate. Thank you for making the change.
