Force all applications to use system proxy in macOS Sierra <body> I am forced to use the company's proxy, but some applications (apps) like Cisco VPN Client, Adobe, and others don't use system proxy, and I can't configure proxy settings in apps.  Is any way to force that alls apps use system proxy?  <comment336616> "I'm under proxy company,..."?  Unclear what you are asking!
