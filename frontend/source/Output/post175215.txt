How do I assign a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript I wrote? <body> How do I assign a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript? I found a script for automatically going back to the inbox in Office 2011.   <answer175226> You can go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - add a new shortcut. You can then select your script.  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18418?locale=en_US  <answer175244> You cannot assign keyboard shortcuts to AppleScripts out of the box. However, you can:  ol liuse a launcher that supports setting global hot keys and executing AppleScripts (Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, FastScripts - whatever takes your fancy), or/li liput the script into a emRun AppleScript/em action inside an Automator service. Note it has to be a service, not an application or an ordinary workflow: services can be assigned hotkeys in the System Preferences keyboard settings./li /ol  <answer247183> It is also possible without paid 3rd party apps!br 1. Open Automator.br 2. Make a new Service.br 3. Make sure it receives 'no input' at all programs.br 4. Select Run Apple Script and type in your code.br 5. Save!  Now go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts. Select Services from the sidebar and find your service. Add a shortcut by double clicking code(none)/code.  Finally go to System Preferences  Security  Privacy  Accessibility and add Automator and the preferred app to run the shortcut.  <answer276839> In summary you will need to use:  ul liAutomator to create a service that runs an Apple Script/li liSystem Preferences to assign a keyboard shortcut to the service/li /ul  Below are the steps involved for each.   strong1.

This is a whole other topic, but if this happens in your case, at least you can run the service from within any application you're using.  Let me know how you go.  <comment206564> That won’t work. The document you are linking to describes how to (re-)assign a hotkey to **a menu command of an application**. <comment340487> Just follow the steps in [@MegaCookie’s answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/247183/11948). <comment340488> What OS version are you own my 10.6.5 mac doesn't seem to have the option "Select Run Apple Script and type in your code"? <comment340491> It’s not “Select Run AppleScript”, it’s – as noted in my answer – the _Run AppleScript_ action you need to add to your Automator service; just drag it into the action area from the library, that will get you a text field with a function scaffold you can add your code to. Also, I doubt the accessibility settings in @MegaCookie’s answer are needed – these pertain to UI Automation. <comment346381> That last "Finally" is important – miss it, and you get a confusing "The action [...] encountered an error" dialog, just offering you to Show Workflow, likely not making you any wiser. <comment347439> Figured out the problem the last step is different on my OS http://mizage.com/help/accessibility.html#10.7 <comment348258> What do you mean by the preferred app? <comment348502> Why must I add finder manually and what apps does this not work on in general?  It seems I sometimes have to run the script under services to get it to register before it will register the keyboard shorcut which is a shame. <comment348503> Yes, the issue I referred in my _Note_ at the end can often (but not always) be rectified by first running a service (and sometimes just accessing the Services menu is enough) before the keyboard shortcut will be recognised. This is an extremely annoying bug that has been around for a _long_ time and I certainly recommend you [send a bug report to Apple](http://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html). As for why you have to add Finder _manually_, simply because it's not added by default. Finally, I didn't understand what you meant by _what apps does this not work on in general_? <comment348505> Ignoring my question about the app not working in some apps.  It appears running the script once under the Service menu rectifies this issue and your explanation explains the issue I was having.  Why must I add Automator Finder under the list Accessibility list it seems to not make a difference when running commands(That was my basic question)? <comment348506> As pointed out by [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/175215/how-do-i-assign-a-keyboard-shortcut-to-an-applescript-i-wrote/276839?noredirect=1#answer-276839) keyboard shorcuts assigned through services are not always consistent. <comment348508> Good question! If you find steps 5 to 9 above for creating a shortcut aren't necessary for you, then that's great. However, I've helped a lot of people create keyboard shortcuts to run custom scripts and have found that including those steps often avoids an error message (don't recall what it is now or under which circumstances it would appear). Perhaps I _shouldn't_ include those steps by default, but that's what I've been doing now for quite a few years (although the exact steps will differ depending on your version of macOS - above I included the steps for El Capitan as per your bounty). <comment349728> Steps 5 to 9 should be perfectly unnecessary for assigning a shortcut, though they might be needed to have the triggered script running smoothly if it uses _UI Automation_ features (simulated mouse clicks and key presses). However, that last case is another issue entirely; you should not conflate two issues by including these steps in your answer. <comment349733> @kopischke Hmm, thanks for this! You may have just shed some light on _why_ Steps 5-9 are needed sometimes and not other times. I'll keep this in mind for future testing and will update this answer (and others) if necessary. :) <comment372175> It would be nice if there was a way to automate the step "now `go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts. Select Services from the sidebar and find your service. Add a shortcut by double clicking (none).`' It must be possible, no idea how though...
