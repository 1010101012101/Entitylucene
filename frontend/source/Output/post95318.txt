How can I record a video of my screen, without any noticeable compression? <body> So I have a client who wanted us to design them a screensaver... In PowerPoint... em"The client's always right!"/em  I have created it and need to record the animated output into a .mov file, for import into a screensaver creator program. My dilemma is this...  ol liWhen choosing to emExport as Movie/em from Powerpoint, it exports without animation - which isn't very helpful/li liWhen using QuickTime Player to record the screen, it records it - but has noticeable compression artefacts throughout the animation/li /ol  I'm fine to purchase a copy of something like ScreenFlow, but I'm wondering if anyone can point me to any alternative/better solutions, before I cough up Â£70 on Screenflow... The Powerpoint is only 30 seconds long, so I'm not fussed about file size without any compression.  Thanks!  <answer95330> Check out Screenium if it suits your needs, I have used it for a few projects and it worked great.
