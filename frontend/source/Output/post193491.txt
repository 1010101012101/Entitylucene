Command + f hangs Finder <body> I just bought a new MacBook Pro running OS X 10.10.3 and then migrated from my old Mavericks MacBook Pro. Now when I search for a file using kbdcommand/kbd+kbdF/kbd, Finder hangs/beachballs/becomes unresponsive after just a few letters. Here's what I tried and what happened:  ol liRemoving com.apple.finder.plist or com.apple.dock.plist from code/Users/username/Library/Preferences/code then rebooting (as suggested various places such as here) didn't fix the problem. /li liTrashing the contents of codeLibrary/Saved Application State//code then rebooting strongdid/strong fix the problemâ€”for exactly one search, subsequent searches had the same problem as before. I deduce that the saved state might be a part of the problem.  /li liRestricting the search to PDF or Document before I type search terms also fixes the problem, from which I think that the size of the set of files to be searched might be a part of the problem./li /ol  What is causing this situation and how can I fix it?  <answer193545> Based upon your descriptions, it appears to be an active bug related to smart search and regular search.  On page two of that discussion, one of the posters stated the following:     Here is what finally fixed for me. I went in mail.app (whose search   was totally misbehaving too), and I rebuild all the mailboxes in my   accounts. (Select all the folders, "Folder" menu, "rebuild") When this   finished, I rebuilt my index again, restarted and... it is working   like a charm since then!
