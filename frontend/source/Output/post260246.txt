How to remap cap-lock to not lock? <body> Previously, I have mapped capslock to control in mocOS, and there was a "disable lock" checkbox or something. Now, when you go to keyboard modifiers, you can set it so that capslock is a control, but it's STILL a locking key. so, it becomes a control lock! That's not what I want. I want it to not lock, to just be a normal control key.  ETA: I just noticed that this is only happening on my microsoft natural keyboard. The internal macbook keyboard appears to be behaving normally. Maybe I just need to update keyboard drivers?  <comment325752> Rebooting (as part of installing an OS update) seems to have solved the problem?
