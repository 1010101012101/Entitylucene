Launchd is running the processor very high? <body> The following processes seem to be using all of my resources on my MacBook Air, macOS 10.12.5. It seems to be Spotlight indexing using all of the CPU resources. I'm wondering if it is possible for me to turn it back on and not have any more problems.  precode launchd  usereventagent  mds /code/pre  Thanks for any help in advance!  <comment357898> Could you please type `launchctl list` into the terminal and put the output into your question? This may help us determine what the culprit is. Furthermore, it would also help if you could take a screenshot of "System Preferences" with the "Users and Groups" pane open, and clicking "Launch Items". -- Thanks <comment358125> I disabled the spotlight( or indexing) through terminal app, the problem is gone, If I re enabled it, will the problem re appear again? <comment358127> The problem would reappear, if you leave the computer on for a day or so, plugged into power, it will properly index, and the problem will likely go away.
