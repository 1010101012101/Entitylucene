Can I use Automator or some other method to extract EXIF GPS data from batches of photos on my Mac? <body> I need a way of extracting EXIF GPS data, using my Mac, from a bunch of photos taken on an iPhone.  So for example, if I put 1000 photos into a folder, I want an easy way of extracting all the GPS data for each photo into a text file.  A solution which gets me close will probably be good enough.  I've looked at Automator but don't see a built in way to do what I need.  I have Aperture, iPhoto and Photoshop CS4 on my Mac in case someone knows a way of incorporating those applications.  <answer9907> There are a number of CLI utilities and scripting libraries available in Fink, MacPorts, and Homebrew available to extract and manipulate EXIF data.  <answer17471> With Commandline tools this is easy:  ul liInstall Homebrew/li licodebrew install exiftools/code  in the Terminal/li licodefind ~/Pictures/ -iname '*.jpg' -print  -exec exiftool -DateTimeOriginal -GPSLatitude -GPSLongitude {} \;/code in the Terminal/li /ul  <comment10367> `exiftags` or `exiftools` work well. <comment204154> Is there any way to do exactly that but on a Windows laptop?
