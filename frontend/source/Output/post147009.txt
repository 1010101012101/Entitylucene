Unable to network login after AD binding (with uid/gid mapping set) <body> I find that when binding my Macs to our AD servers with the uid and gid mapping enabled in dsconfigad, a network user is unable to log in. With the relevant flags not set, a network user can log in just fine.  These are the commands that we are using to bind:  precodedsconfigad –force –add server.company.com –username joindomain –password password –computer MacClient35 –ou ou=mac,ou=workstations,dc=server,dc=company,dc=com dsconfigad –packetencrypt allow –packetsign allow –uid uidnumber –gid gidnumber /code/pre  I’ve verified with our AD guys that all looks fine at their end, the AD schema has been extended with the attributes ‘uidnumber' and ‘gidnumber'. We’re binding to AD servers based on Windows 2008 R2 and clients are running OS X 10.9.5. We have no OS X servers in our environment.  After entering a password the spinning wheel next to the password spins for about 1-2 seconds. After that, my password is highlighted and there’s a right arrow on the right hand side of the password dialog box.   If I open Terminal and type ‘login’; Without the mapping set I can log in, and an ‘id krt43’ (my AD account) also gives me expected results. With the mapping set, I get ‘login incorrect’ when entering my username.  I don’t know whether it is related, but it doesn’t look like users are getting placed into SMBHome after login, but rather a /home/username directory which I guess is local to the Mac (not /Users). Certainly the folders that I expect to be seeing on the SMB share in the user’s folder don’t get created there e.g. Documents, Library, Music etc. I’d read of some potential issues with SMB2 in Mavericks, but forcing SMB1 on the client doesn’t improve the situation.  Has anybody else had seen this? Any advice is greatly appreciated!  Kelly
