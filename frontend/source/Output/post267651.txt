Slide annotation a la PowerPoint on Windows <body> I use Windows and on it, Office 2016 for annotating powerpoint slides using my Wacom Intuous tablet. Office for Mac has basic annotation support but some issues:   ol liLines are very low-res -- much like the mouse. Pen pressure etc. are ignored /li liWhen I move the slide forward, the annotations are discarded (even if I don't close the slideshow./li /ol  Is there some alternative (either web-based or desktop based) on the Mac where I can use proper pen annotations? Need at lease a solution to the two points above. Paid options can also be considered provided they're not too expensive.
