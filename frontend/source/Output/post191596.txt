Drawings on books purchased with iBooks <body> Say I buy a book using iBooks (OS X Yosemite on a MacBook Pro). Using iBooks, I can highlight text and add notes. What about drawing shapes? e.g. circles, squares, arrows, etc.   If this is not possible with iBooks itself, is there any way to open a book bought with iBook on a different app with more editing support?  <answer191639> If your books are really PDFs, and there are no security restrictions, you could use Adobe/Acrobat Reader with its commenting tools.   <comment227635> Nomally paid for books from Apple's iBookstore can only be opened with the iBooks app.  There are a few exceptions where the publisher does not use DRM, like O'Reilly. <comment227636> The store where you buy things using iBooks does not carry pdf's.
