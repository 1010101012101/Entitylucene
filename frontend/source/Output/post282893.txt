Excel Formula using substitute function to replace quotation marks <body> Substitute formula is codesubstitute(cell to focus on, text to replace, text that replaces it)/code. 2nd and 3rd inputs need to be in quotations it seems to get the function to work.  So how would you substitute a single quotation mark in a cell.  None of the following work:  precode=substitute(A1,""","%22C") =substitute(A1,&amp;char(32), "%22C") =substitute(A1,"&amp;char(32)","%22C") =substitute(A1,"\"","%22C") /code/pre  Any ideas?  <answer282895> precode=SUBSTITUTE(A1,CHAR(34),"%22C") /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZX3n.png" width="157"  code&amp;/code is for concatenation, but you're not concatenating, so it should be omitted.br codeCHAR(34)/code, not 32, is the double quote character.  <comment356555> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software within the scope defined in the [help centre](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic). <comment356556> Sorry George; upvote for the answer but a close vote for the question :/ <comment356560> @Tetsujin I didn't notice this was about Excel and not Numbers; my answer was for Numbers, just so happens it works exactly the same in Excel too! Fair point, I've voted for closure for migration to Super User. <comment356561> I think it would be a better fit there, for sure. Lots of Excel questions on there. <comment356578> Also, =substitute(A1,"""","%22C")  """" backs out a single ". <comment356626> This question is a "I'm using mac:office 2011 and have a problem with an Excel formula" away from being perfectly on topic. And it got an valid answer already. I don't see a reason to close or migrate it.
