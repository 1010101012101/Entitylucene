How to extend a window over display/workspace in Yosemite <body> Is there a way to extend a window over one display in OS X Yosemite, i.e. to make it larger than one display?  <answer200850> Only manually.br Alt/click the green dot, top left, which ought to fill the screen at least top to bottom, then grab the right edge &amp; drag across.   Alternatively, grabbing the bottom right corner will let you do it in one move,  but without aligning the left edge.   <answer200865> System Preferences - Mission Control - Untick "Displays have separate Spaces" and restart.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VoXvh.png" alt="enter image description here"  After restart, you will be able to have 1 window expand over 2 displays.
