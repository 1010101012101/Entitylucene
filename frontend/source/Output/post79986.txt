Why can't I paste into the password dialog when mounting an encrypted disk image? <body> I've got an encrypted disk sparse bundle disk image and I've used fstab with the right UUID to mount it someplace other than /Volumes. What I would like is to just dbl-click on it, enter the password and have it show up where I want it. I use a password manager and I have intentionally chosen a long random gibberish password for the disk image. It seems that I am not allowed to paste my password into the dialog that asks for a password when mounting an encrypted disk image.   Am I doing something wrong?  <answer79988> No, you aren't doing anything wrong. Apple doesn't allow you to paste into certain emsecure/em dialog boxes. It's a feature, not a bug. (It makes a brute force hack of the dialog box more difficult.)  You can paste the password into the command line if you mount the secure image using emhdiutil/em.  Open strongTerminal/strong and type:  precode hdiutil attach /path/to/imagefile -stdinpass /code/pre  When prompted for the password, copy it from a text file or (preferably) a password vault and paste it into terminal.  If the empath/to/imagefile/em is complex, you can type the command, a space, then drag the imagefile icon from the finder into the terminal window to automatically enter the empath/filname/em.  <answer80021> Apple's security prevents this as answered separately by jaberg.  But are you not prompted to store the password in your keychain?  I've only used encrypted physical volumes and not disk images, but I'm always prompted to store the password to my keychain.  <answer105960> I wrote a very tiny AppleScript application which allows you to paste passwords even where its not allowed by tricking the system into thinking that you're typing on your keyboard. The downside: it takes space in your Dock.  <answer105980> You could also run a script like this in AppleScript Editor:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SecurityAgent"     set value of text field 1 of window 1 to (the clipboard)     click button 1 of group 1 of window 1 end tell /code/pre  It requires access for assistive devices to be enabled from System Preferences.  <comment92289> The OS also disables keyboard loggers when in a secure text entry field. TextExpander is an example of a legitimate keyboard logger. <comment92291> Awesome. So I'm encouraged to only use a password that I can remember and type easily. <comment92294> I generate and store the passwords in *Password Wallet* and  type them into the dialog. They're not overly long, but they are random and at least to my thinking, they're secure enough. <comment92298> Storing the password in the system keychain runs against the notion of keeping the enclosed files secure. If someone has access to your open account, they can access the encrypted files. You *could* however move the keys for encrypted images into a second keychain that is protected by a different password. That way you would only have one additional complex password to remember. <comment92556> I specifically don't want to use the keychain. I use my password manager for that. <comment132403> What an odd choice by Apple, to make brute-forcing the dialog box harder, while it's still possible (and I would say easier) to brute-force the command-line utility. <comment137223> WOW! Thanks a lot. These 4 lines will save me hours of time and make my passwords stronger. <comment194901> @drfrogsplat, exactly. This is a terrible featureâ€”all it does is make it harder to use password managers. <comment213522> This feature is outdated and stupid... can't use 1password at all. Can't even copy the suggested password <comment230483> How are you trying to paste? I've found areas where `cmd+v` doesn't work but `ctrl+click  paste` does work. <comment248612> I would strongly recommend that people use `hdiutil` [as jaberg answered](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/79988/25019) instead of resorting to UI automations such as this one. <comment251614> thank you! my keyboard is being fragged and the left and right shift keys dont work - not so good for passwords that need shift-numbers on a mac book air ;9 <comment262296> if you're trying to mount an encrypted logical volume, as I was, then https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2011/11/23/using-the-command-line-to-unlock-or-decrypt-your-filevault-2-encrypted-boot-drive/ has the magic command: "diskutil corestorage unlockVolume UUID -stdinpassphrase", where UUID is the volume Id you'll see in "diskutil list" output. <comment304415> Wow, so you get penalized for picking long, complex passwords
