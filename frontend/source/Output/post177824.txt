How do I automate selecting files in a .jar file? <body> My .jar file has a number of buttons that, when clicked, prompts me to select a file to load. I need to find a way to get this file selection to be automated, and decided on applescript.   Unfortunately, so far I have not been able to get keystroke to work when the "select file" screen comes up.  So far, I have:  precodetell application "System Events" to set frontmost of process "java" to true tell application "System Events"     tell process "java"         keystroke tab &amp; tab &amp; tab &amp; tab &amp; tab &amp; tab         key code 76 using {keystroke space}     end tell end tell /code/pre  because using this does not work:  precodetell application "System Events" to set frontmost of process "java" to true tell application "System Events"     tell process "java"         keystroke tab &amp; tab &amp; tab &amp; tab &amp; tab &amp; tab         key code 76 using {keystroke space} --- stops here         key code 124         key code 76     end tell end tell /code/pre
