Can't install homebrew formula, says "Error: File exists - build" <body> I am trying to install codewine/code, by running codebrew install wine/code, but it fails. This is the output:  precode==&gt; Installing dependencies for wine: jasper, gmp ==&gt; Installing wine dependency: jasper ==&gt; Using the sandbox ==&gt; Downloading https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/archive/version-2.0.9.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Users/gustaf/Library/Caches/Homebrew/jasper-2.0.9.tar.gz Error: File exists - build /code/pre  Both dependencies are already installed.  <answer267269> I met the same problem, but I solved it while installing the winetricks.  precodebrew install winetricks /code/pre  it will install the wine too, but won't report the error on my Mac.  <answer267436> I ran into this same problem when I was trying to upgrade codejasper/code  The issue appears to be that the formula wants you to build in a subdirectory called codebuild/code but there is already a directory called build in the repository.  My fix was to modify line 21 of the formula.  You can edit the formula with  precodebrew edit jasper /code/pre  and change line 21 to read  precodemkdir "build2" do /code/pre  or similar.  <comment334617> Have you tried deleting the file from the cache? <comment334618> https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/README.md#troubleshooting
