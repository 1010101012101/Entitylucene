iTunes Genius mixes <body> I deleted a Genius mix, thinking it would make room for another, but none appeared and I'm wondering how to get back the one I deleted. Also, I had a Genius mix that I really liked but it doesn't show up any more ever since I did an update. Any ideas?  <comment87114> Try disabling and re-enabling Genius.
