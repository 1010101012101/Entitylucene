DNS issue with Microsoft Sharepoint <body> I am having this issue on my MacBook Air but not on my Windows machine or even my Windows virtual machine on the Macbook Air.  Client uses Microsoft SharePoint for documents and logs.  I was given two links.  I will replace client name with the word "client"  stronghttp://myclient.client.com/GlobalERP/SitePages/Home.aspx/strong I can get into this one and read stuff but cannot use the SharePoint functionality like adding items, editing, filtering, etc.   This is true in either Mac or Windows  stronghttp://myclient/GlobalERP/SitePages/Home.aspx/strong This one works on Windows and allows all functionality, add, edit, everything.  However, on the Mac, I get a DNS error seen below.  This Page Cannot Be Displayed  The host name resolution (DNS lookup) for this host name ( www.myclient.com ) has failed. The Internet address may be misspelled or obsolete, the host ( www.myclient.com ) may be temporarily unavailable, or the DNS server may be unresponsive.  Please check the spelling of the Internet address entered. If it is correct, try this request later.
