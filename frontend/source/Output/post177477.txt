How to remove the Finder menu bar when in fullscreen? <body> Trying to use an application in fullscreen mode, but if I move the pointer just a emlittle/em too far when trying to select things at the top of the display the menu bar drops down instead.  Is there a way to disable this, either in per-app settings or from a particular monitor/display?  Using OS X 10.10.x  <comment209932> ctrl+fn+F2 (you need the fn if your F keys are not enabled) <comment209933> @Buscarì›ƒ - thanks, but that looks like it makes the bar appear permanently. Is there a way to disable the mouseover to drop down the menu? <comment210009> No, you cannot disable the menu bar appearing.
