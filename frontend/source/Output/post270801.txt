Using the same HDD with macOS and Windows <body> Is it possible to use the same external HDD for both macOS and Windows? For example, can I use it as backup storage for both systems?   If so, should it have at least 2 partitions?  <answer270804> I am doing this with TWO External HDs so I can guarantee my advice is correct.  It's possible strongIF/strong you have (third party) software installed that let's MacOS, Windows, or both strongREAD AND WRITE/strong the other filesystem (the driver's that come with Mac OS are strongREAD-ONLY/strong).  Otherwise you will need separate partitions for each OS. If you are using Time Machine I strongVERY STRONGLY RECOMMEND/strong you give it a dedicated partition regardless of drivers!  <comment340426> Good answer, but I disagree! I would recommend formatting the external drive (unless you're using it for time machine) as ExFAT! This way neither MacOS nor Windows need drivers to access the data! <comment340427> Depends on intended use. ExFAT was a 4gb file size limit that is sometimes unrealistic for modern file sizes. For example, if the poster wants to share his iTunes library between OSes like I do and has lots of videos the 4gb limit may get in the way. <comment340428> @BryanDunphy you're thinking of FAT32.  ExFat's file size limit (peta/exabyte range) dwarfs the largest drives available.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT <comment340430> Okay, I don't use ExFAT myself so I got confused. <comment340435> Last point. ExFAT was designed for SSDs and has about 5x SLOWER reading and writing speed on physical disks (like most external drives) than HFS+ or NTFS! <comment340510> Where did you get such info about the design purpose of ExFAT format? Provide references. Otherwise your "last point" doesn't make any sense. <comment340573> Wikipedia article on "ExFAT" search for it then "solid" in the article.
