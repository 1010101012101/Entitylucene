How to download and install Darwin 13 OS in x86? <body> I've conducted a research on UNIX operating systems and found out that an experimental OS (Darwin) is used for development of the OSX; just like Fedora on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.br/ Darwin OS has a license of "Apple Public Source License" or freeware.br/ Darwin OS can be installed on x86 computer architectures according to Wikipedia.br/br/ I've searched all over the net and torrent sites but it seems that the links to recent versions of the OS like 13, 12, etc. are very hard to find.br/ I've tried the site "opensource.apple.com" but the "Download" section could not be found. I think that the links are hidden.br/br/ 1) Where can I download a recent version of Darwin like 12, 11, or 10? I just found Darwin 8.0.1 here.br/ 2) Can I download the source code and just compile it to ISO format?br/ 3) Can you give me direct links?br/ Answers will help me a lot for studying Objective-C (Java programmer here).br/ Thanks!  <answer144581> The PureDarwin project is attempting to maintain a complete and bootable implementation of the Darwin OS. From their website:     One current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO of Darwin 10.x and Darwin 9.x.   Darwin itself is a modified FreeBSD OS with Mach microkernel.  Note though that having Darwin is not a necessary part of developing in Obj-C. Both gcc and clang support Obj-C development in newer versions. You are, of course, limited in what you can do relative to using Obj-C on an OS X machine because there are far fewer standard libraries available outside of the OS X world for Obj-C.  <comment170307> Thanks! Objective-C is developed by Apple, and also Darwin. I just wanted to use Apple technology to build Apple apps. <comment170311> If you want to build Apple apps you need Apple's OS and Xcode. You can build generic, runs-on-any-*nix, Obj-C programs with Darwin and the above mentioned compilers but you won't have access to Apple's rich Cocoa and Obj-C libraries without Xcode and OS X. <comment170312> Ok got it. I'll be a generic programmer for now using Darwin. <comment170316> You don't even need Darwin then. Any old *nix that runs a modern version of `gcc` or `clang` will do just fine. <comment170318> Ok but I think it would be awesome if I use an Apple OS for developing in Apple programming language. Just like what I'm doing with Java and Oracle Linux. Thanks. <comment170320> And also using C# in Windows to complete.
