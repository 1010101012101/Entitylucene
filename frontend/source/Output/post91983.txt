How can I "link" different files to my folder without using soft link? <body> I have some some folders look like this structure:  ul listrongBuy/strong folder - state_diagram_for_buy, activity_diagram_for_buy /li listrongSell/strong folder - state_diagram_for_sell, activity_diagram_for_sell/li listrongSearch/strong folder - state_diagram_for_search, activity_diagram_for_search/li /ul  I want to group all the state_diagrams and activity diagrams in two folder. So one folder is used to store state_diagram and another one is used to store the activity diagrams.  However, I don't want to copy those file, since any changes in the original files cannot reflect on the copy one. I know there is a Unix command: codeln/code can be used to create the linking. But are there other ways to create the linkings in finder because I don't know to type the commands many time...  <answer91998> You can make an emalias/em for a file using the File  Make Alias menu in Finder.  (Alternatively, drag the file icon whilst holding kbdalt/kbd and kbdcmd/kbd.)  So, for example, set up your emBuy/em, emSell/em and emSearch/em folders as you describe.  Then create a emState diagrams/em folder, and kbdalt/kbd-kbdcmd/kbd-drag the state_diagram files into it.  <answer92043> You can create a smart search for each type of file. Make a search in Finder by file name (you can also enter other criteria) and when you're satisfied with the results, save it.  <answer178060> hipSpace.app is a temporal workspace. It records our informations using strongreferences/strong on them, it lets dedicated applications to manage the location of their own stuff. By defaults, adding, drag&amp;dropping or copy&amp;pasting into hipSpace, will not move neither change our original informations. Hope it can help you. http://hipSpace.net  <comment108000> Might it not be easier to use one folder with the standard names you have then to find all but - esearch for *_buy.* and for start diagram for state* . ln is the shortest you can type so I don't see how it could be quicker <comment210822> This sounds more like a generic product description than an actual answer to a quite specific question. How would the OP use hipSpace to solve the problem described in the question? <comment211033> hipSpace is like a Folder of soft links (alias). Code4j can drag (or copy/paste) all activiy_diagram (_buy, _sell, _search) into it ! Ok, for the moment hipSpace represents one Folder of aliases, Code4j needs 2 Folders. A workaround could to divide the Space in 2 parts.
