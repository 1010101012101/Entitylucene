iOS: open text file with not text extension <body> Trying to get SSH private key from *.pk file.  Currently use app to extract this file from "external source" and it gives me an options to open this file in mail app / dropbox / btsync but not in notes app, for example.  Is there any tool / app to do that?  <answer171079> Being able to do that with iEditor - the only program to open any file as text.
