Remove "Creative Cloud Files" from Finder sidebar? <body> I've used Activity Monitor to close every process with the Creative Cloud icon.  I've deleted the Creative Cloud Files directory itself, and deleted it from the trash.  I've gone to the "Extensions" preference pane and turned off "Core Sync."  I've quit Finder and restarted it.  And yet the "Creative Cloud Files" icon still shows up in my Finder sidebar, even though the original can't be found.  How can I eliminate this zombie icon once and for all?  <answer257410> strongThis is how you show / hide certain icons of the Finder Sidebar:/strong  Try a right-click on the folder, then em'Remove from Sidebar'/em.  1) Go to em'Finder'/em, then open em'Preferences'/em from the menu bar img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnvaK.png" alt="Finder Menu bar"  2) Navigate to the em'Sidebar'/em tabbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YWqXO.png" alt="Sidebar (Finder)"  3) Uncheck the appropriate icon(s) as required. Then close.br I believe that apps like CCleaner can clean up these "ghost" directories too. However, based on your question, these steps should do the job. Let me know how you get on.  <answer257443> Apparently one of the actions I mentioned in the question actually emdid/em solve the issue, but it required an actual log out and log in before it took effect.  Relaunching Finder wasn't enough.  <answer262019> If you want to REMOVE Creative Cloud completely from your mac there is a uninstaller link run it on your mac and it will be gone.

Creative Cloud desktop failed to update. (Error Code: 2)  In such a situation, follow the steps below to uninstall, and then reinstall the Creative Cloud desktop app. <comment351065> Nope, it isn't listed in the finder preferences (which is probably the first hint this is a dirty hack going on). However, a suggestion by @NoahL to drag it from the sidebar (comment on the original question) seems to have worked (at least before restart...) <comment351066> Dragging the icon from the sidebar seems to do the trick... (no need to open preferences). Thanks, @NoahL!
