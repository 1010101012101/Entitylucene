uninstall Net-SNMP? <body> I want to install my own Net-SNMP because the preinstalled Net-SNMP is too old. But when I install a newer Net-SNMP via Homebrew, my path doesn't use the latest Net-SNMP.  I would think the best option is to just remove the preinstalled Net-SNMP. How do i uninstall the preinstalled Net-SNMP?  <answer69841> No. The best option is to keep the old one, and find out what Homebrew set the --prefix to:     By default, codemake install' will install the package's files in   /code/usr/local/bin', code/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an   installation prefix other than/code/usr/local' by giving codeconfigure' the   option/code--prefix=PATH'.   That's the default for Net-SNMP There's a Perl Module involved as well, you may need to set INSTALL5LIB to point to your new installation.
