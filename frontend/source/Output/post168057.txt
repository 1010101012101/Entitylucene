Mp3 file sounds fine in some media players but not others <body> I have a number of mp3 files that I encoded via LAME from the original super nes sound files. They sound fine in the following:  ul liWindows Media Player/li liFoobar2000 (windows)/li liVLC (all platforms)/li liClementine (linux)/li lidoubleTwist cloud player (android)/li /ul  But there are constant sound flubs in itunes in sierra (as well as the last umpteen versions of itunes dating back to mavericks (when I first had this problem) emas well as/em doubletwist on mac.  As I am primarily a Mac user, I would emreally/em like to get these sounding correct in iTunes rather than use VLC et al. All I found about it was this. Does anyone know why this would be the case?  I've used mediaInfo to look at a good and 'bad' mp3:  emGood/em (plays in all players on all platforms):  precodeDragon Quest VI Another World MPEG Audio Overall bit rate mode: variable Overall bit rate: 130kbps 32.0 kHz 2chan MPEG version 1 layer 3 /code/pre  emBad/em  precodeFinal Fantasy V Ahead on our Way Overall bit rate mode: variable Overall bit rate: 210 kbps 32.0 kHz 2chan MPEG version 1 layer 3 /code/pre  <comment197117> Try something like [MediaInfo Mac](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download/Mac_OS) old version is free, newest is 99¢ & see if you can spot a difference in the encoding in ones that work & ones that don't <comment197120> I'll check it out, but just to make sure I was clear in my question, its not that some of the sound files work and some don't, its that the *same* files work in one media player (eg VLC) but not in others (eg iTunes, doubleTwist). <comment197121> Sure - I understood that. I meant to check ones that work everywhere against ones that are more picky. or… are they all glitchy in iTunes etc. if so, check against something that isn't [of course] or… edit 2… throw them at me over dropbox or something & I'll have a go here <comment197122> How exactly did you encode them (bps, variable etc)? <comment197124> Edited my post, let me know if you need the actual files. @patrix variable, since the original files were meant for minimal footprint on decades-old hardware it never occured to me that sound quality would be any kind of issue, mp3 is a compressed format but the original .scp file for the entire album is smaller than the mp3 for 1 track. Also sorry I apparently undid your formatting edits, I must have edited right about the same time as you. Thank you for fixing it (again) <comment197130> eek - I've never heard of .scp as an audio format - not sure if I've got anything that can handle it. Can't even find any real ref on Google for them <comment197131> Super nintendo soundfiles. Foobar2000 (windows) can handle (and with a LAME plugin, convert) them. I know its rather obscure.
