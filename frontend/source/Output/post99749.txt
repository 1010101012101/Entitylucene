Change window of an app while Drag & Drop <body> Is it somehow possible to change the window within an application with kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&lt;/kbd (sorry, German keyboard here, I guess it's kbd⌘/kbd+kbd`/kbd (?) on English keyboards) while Drag &amp; Drop something? While it works between different applications it seems not to work within one application with multiple windows. It's especially annoying with small screens and a lot of overlapping windows.  Example 1: Mark text in browser, drag it, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdTAB/kbd to terminal (mutliple windows), kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&lt;/kbd to the terminal window you want to drop the text. This works.  Example 2: Mark text in browser, drag it, try to kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&lt;/kbd to another browser window. This does not work. Same thing with drag &amp; drop of files between two (overlapping) finder windows. It is possible to do this if you use Exposé, but that's quite slow compared to kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&lt;/kbd.  It's a really annoying thing which bugs me since years and it's still an issue with OS X 10.8.  <answer100418> Might I suggest you use copy-and-paste instead of drag-and-drop?  <answer151235> Finally, with OS X 10.10 Yosemite, this works as expected!  <comment118337> Sure, that would work with text and probably other objects. But there are cases where this won't work. For example an image in a website can't (easily) copied-and-pasted, but drag&drop would work.
