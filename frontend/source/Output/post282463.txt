Use Homebrew LLVM over Xcode <body> I'm trying to compile an algorithm package received by someone else. Basically all I need to do is run a bash script and everything will be compiled automatically. Now upon executing the script, I get a lot of errors, such as:  precodeclang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp' /code/pre  My understanding is that the Apple LLVM does not support OpenMPI, so what I did is install the newest gcc version by installing LLVM (version 4.0) through Homebrew. I tried to add this to my bash profile by adding the following (found on the web â€“ my apologies, this isn't my home terrain):  precode# export PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH # export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$(llvm-config --includedir):$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH  # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(llvm-config --libdir):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  /code/pre  But this unfortunately didn't do the trick. I get the same errors, and I found out my computer still uses clang:  precode$ g++ --version Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.5.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin /code/pre  Does anybody know what to do? I can't use another installer by specifying the version, since it's a long bash script, and I wouldn't know what to change where.   <answer282466> Didn't think carefully about it, but did you try to "brew link --force" LLVM?  Check the current compilers, e.g.   precodeiMac:~ sir$ which gcc-6 /usr/local/bin/gcc-6 iMac:~ sir$ which gcc /usr/bin/gcc /code/pre  then, do e.g.  precodeln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc-6 /usr/bin/gcc /code/pre  you might have to sudo.  <comment355826> This does not provide an answer to the question.

It is not a clarification request. It is an answer : do  "brew link --force gcc" <comment355830> Please don't do that.  You edited your post from being a question to a declarative statement.
