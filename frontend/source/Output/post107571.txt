OS X Mavericks wakes my Mac from sleep every hour or so <body> Ever since upgrading to Mavericks, it looks like my Mac Mini wakes from sleep about once an hour or so. In the Console, I get the following message:  precodeOct 30 02:12:06 gary-mac WindowServer[93]: CGXDisplayDidWakeNotification [89885620192550]: posting kCGSDisplayDidWake Oct 30 02:12:06 gary-mac WindowServer[93]: handle_will_sleep_auth_and_shield_windows: Deferring. /code/pre  Anyone know why it's doing this?  Usually when the computer wakes from sleep, whether manually or automatically, there is a "Wake Reason" line, but in this case there isn't one. My guess is that this is because since Mavericks, "Sleep" doesn't actually put the Mini to sleep. It seems to be more "on" than it used to be. Is there a way to revert the behavior to how it was before Mavericks?  <answer108327> Turns out it was because I had "File sharing" enabled in my "Sharing" System Preferences pane. I've always had this setting enabled, and I could sleep my Mac just fine before Mavericks. However starting with Mavericks, if I sleep my Mac with "File sharing" enabled, then the Mac won't sleep.  <answer110979> Since I started to share files on my Mac, I had the insomnia issue as well. There is a great little tool called emPleaseSleep/em which is freeware and supports Mavericks. It will help your Mac to stay asleep.

I just checked and that seems to have fixed it. Unlike Gary, however, I did have a Wake Reason line every time. <comment127032> I definitely have "Wake for network access" DISABLED. I have everything on Energy Saver disabled actually.
