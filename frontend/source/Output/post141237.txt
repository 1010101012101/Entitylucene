Unable to install 'Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 7 (with JDK 7u45)' <body> I have downloaded an java j2ee and jdk installer from Oracle  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yB6Mz.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I run it I got this error message:  precode$ ./java_ee_sdk-7-jdk7-macosx-x64-ml.sh Extracting the installer archive... Extracing bundled JDK...  Could not locate a suitable Java runtime. Please ensure that you have Java 7 or newer installed on your system and accessible in your PATH or by setting JAVA_HOME /code/pre  At the moment I have only got java 6 in my MBP (running OSX 10.9.4).  I would have expected the installer is smart enough to run from the unpacked bundled JDK.   Is there any workaround?  <answer141238> The Enterprise Edition of the JDK does not contain the JRE -- you have to install that stand alone first and only then install the JDK as detailed here :  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/  <comment166514> Thanks for the answer! I have installed the JRE 1.7 successfully (plugin in safari is tested ok) but I can't access the new java command in the shell. Do you have any more info/pointer? <comment166523> I have figured it out. I have to install the Java SDK. The java_ee_sdk-7-jdk7-macosx-x64-ml.sh package has a dependency of `jar` which is not available in JRE.
