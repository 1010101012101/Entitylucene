Variable not defined (AppleScript) <body> For some reason codethe name of thePath/code comes up as not defined by my Automator workflow.  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Finder"         set thePath to the (first item of the input)         set namedFolder to ((the name of thePath) as text)         set namedFolder to ((text 1 thru 13) of namedFolder)     end tell     return namedFolder end run /code/pre  <answer144828> codenamedFolder/code only exists in the scope of your codetell/code block. Define it first thing so that it will persist after youâ€™re done with Finder.  precodeset namedFolder to "" tell application "Finder"     ... end tell return namedFolder /code/pre  Alternatively, you could just put the codereturn/code statement inside the codetell/code block.  <comment313776> Are you still a user of SOF?
