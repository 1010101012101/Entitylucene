Cannot connect to developer network in Xcode 6 <body> I have downloaded Xcode 6 and I cannot connect to the developer server to download my provisioning profiles. When I try to add my Apple ID it simply say cannot connect. If I type a wrong password it recognizing my account, but with the right password it does not connect.  Is there any solution for that?
