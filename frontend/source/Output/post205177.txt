OneNote for OS X, How to type a dash then a space without turning it into a list <body> I am currently using OneNote for OS X to take notes at college.  I currently need to do maths when using OneNote. Whenever I type a code-/code then a space OneNote automatically turns that into a list, when I disable the list it then removes the '-' which I made. This means I am unable to do what I want. Here are some examples on what I mean.  I want to do  pre   0111 - 0001 ------   0001 /pre  However OneNote turns it into a list like this  pre    0111     -   0001 /pre  As you can see, this is rather annoying, I then remove the list buy chasing list style none however that removes the dash, if I was then to do a space at the beginning it would be turned back into a list. Is there a way I can prevent this from happening?  <answer205221> After it changes to a list, press kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdZ/kbd.  It's a common routine for things auto-corrected by apps if you don't want them to be auto-corrected, same with MS Office for Windows.  <comment247469> Ah, Thanks. So I basically undo what it done then? <comment247475> Yup, I am yet to try it on my Macbook Air though. But that's how it works with emojis when you want them to display text instead. <comment247482> Doesn't matter on emojis. I won't be using them. :)
