FusionDrive seems to not use SSD <body> I'm trying to make a homebrew FD of 500GB HDD and 128GB SSD. I'm using Maverics 10.9.1 and MD101 MBP.  What I did was:  ol liinstall HDD into superdrive bay/li liinstall SSD into HDD compartment/li liuse codediskutil cs convert/code on HDD to make it a CoreStorage Logical volume/li liadd SSD into the logical volume with codediskutil cs addDisk/code/li liresize Logical volume to use all available space on both SSD and HDD with codediskutil cs resizeVolume/code/li /ol  What I can see now is a volume that has a capacity of summary capacity of SSD and HDD, but codeiostat/code shows that SSD load is zero. No matter what I'm doing - copying files around, downloading new files, etc. it remains zero (here disk0 is my SSD, disk1 is HDD and disk3 is a USB drive with TimeMachine backups):  precode          disk0           disk1           disk3       cpu     load average KB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s  us sy id   1m   5m   15m 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00   1  2 96  1.08 1.32 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00   1  1 98  1.08 1.32 1.13 0.00   0  0.00   114.00   2  0.22     0.00   0  0.00   6  3 91  1.08 1.32 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     9.24  29  0.26     0.00   0  0.00   8  5 87  1.08 1.32 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     8.62  65  0.54     0.00   0  0.00   8  5 87  1.08 1.32 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     9.65  88  0.83     0.00   0  0.00  26  9 64  1.08 1.32 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     3.96  78  0.30     0.00   0  0.00  28  2 70  1.07 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00    20.65  94  1.89     0.00   0  0.00  19  4 77  1.07 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00    12.96  47  0.59     0.00   0  0.00  17 11 73  1.07 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00    51.02  89  4.43     4.00   1  0.00  12 12 77  1.07 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00    15.78 148  2.28     0.00   0  0.00  16 10 74  1.07 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00    14.02 273  3.74     0.00   0  0.00   7  4 89  1.06 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00    16.17 146  2.30     0.00   0  0.00   8  5 86  1.06 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00   1  1 97  1.06 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00   1  1 98  1.06 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00   5  3 91  1.06 1.31 1.13 0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00   2  2 96  0.98 1.28 1.12 0.00   0  0.00    12.00   5  0.06     0.00   0  0.00   2  2 96  0.98 1.28 1.12 0.00   0  0.00    31.00   4  0.12     0.00   0  0.00   2  3 95  0.98 1.28 1.12 0.00   0  0.00    52.00   1  0.05     0.00   0  0.00   5  4 91  0.98 1.28 1.12 /code/pre  codediskutil cs list/code:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 8ACC1316-4CD3-44F4-AC77-E6DBB9E8FDCC     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         626939805696 B (626.9 GB)     Free Space:   1335816192 B (1.3 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 1BACBF70-83E2-47C2-9EE1-672920B6CB75     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     499248103424 B (499.2 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume DDD92F99-310F-4204-9C3E-B4EFC8A2C0E6     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     127691702272 B (127.7 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 0062228C-F252-4261-85FB-D595D0EA9BC5         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 93ADABE5-D785-4519-8435-8B5EC7D904B0             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          624999997440 B (625.0 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  Don't think that it's normal, but who knows. Has anyone faced such problem? What have I done wrong?  <answer129529> It seems that the order of the disks is important, when you are adding a SSD after a HDD, the Fusion Drive is not functioning as it should be.  Look at this question: Is there a way to change order of physical disks in Corestorage  <answer172101> Can confirm it's the order of HDD-SSD! I have the same issue on my MBP 13" 9.2  Usually, the instructions assume that you disk0 is the HDD and disk1 the SSD. This should be the case 99% of times, but not in mine (just like with yours).  The DVD-Replacement Hard Disk Caddy I bought only supported SATA2 not SATA3, which caused random errors with the SSD. So the solution was to put the HDD in the Caddy in the SSD in the Hard Drive slot. Problem solved, I thought.  But of course, I completely forgot about it when setting up the Fusion Drive. And now, I have the very same symptoms: it is a CoreStorage LVG, but not a Fusion Drive.  My codediskutil cs list/code looks the same as yours. Usually there should be a mention of Fusion Drive, but not for me.  <comment144160> Didn't found anything useful to solve the problem, so just installed a new system onto SSD and using HDD for heavy non-performance-critical stuff like music, movies and downloads <comment147741> Have the same issue. Didn't find this post earlier so created a [new topic](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126170/is-there-a-way-to-change-order-of-physical-disks-in-corestorage) with my attempts. It seems that the order of physical volumes in Logical Volume Group plays a crucial role here, but I haven't found a definitive answer for that. <comment147812> @almaz I've seen some posts saying that volumes order does play a role and some other posts saying that it doesn't. I'm not going to play with it right now as my current approach works quite well for me, but if you'll find a clue, please let me know
