Window out of visible workspace range / unreachable <body> I'm running strongOS X Lion/strong on a MacBook Air 11", and when I unplug my secondary display, some windows (e.g., emFinder/em) are overflowing at the edge of the screen.br This usually happens on the right-hand side of the [work]space, so I have access to their title bar to drag them back.  But this time, the emMS Word 2011/em window is overflowing out of visible workspace range in a way that makes it unreachable: it's like having a big negative offset on the vertical axis.   ol liI can see the window in emExposé/em, tried moving it to another [work]space (and back), but the window position stays the same./li liThe emthree finger drag/em is enabled, but I cannot reach the window's title bar./li /ol  hr  Researching through other questions, I saw that Afloat counts among it's features the ability to      Move windows from anywhere, not just the title bar.   just like other window management apps.   But I'm primarily interested if there's any strongbuilt-in solution/strong within OS X Lion for this specific issue.  hr  Is there a key combination to move a window from any active area?  Or how can this be solved w/o re-attaching the secondary display?  <answer42813> I have the same problem when using some--not all--external monitors with my 2011 Macbook Pro running Snow Leopard. The only "solution" I've found is the following:  ol liSelect the file that's off screen (from the Window menu in Word), so that the focus is on that file./li liPress cmd+S to make sure the file is saved./li liPress cmd+W to close the file./li liReopen the file./li /ol  The file reopens on my laptop screen and all is well again. It's not pretty, but it gets your file back where it belongs reasonably quickly.   <answer59430> Windows can also be moved by dragging them from the edges. For example dragging a window horizontally from the bottom edge usually moves it.  You could also try selecting the Zoom action from the Window menu.  <answer62281> I experienced the same challenge:  ol liAn external monitor/li liThe external monitor is the desktop /li liMS Word/li liOnly the bottom 1/2 inch of Word was exposed/li /ol  Solution  ol liUnplug the monitor /li liWord was properly positioned on the laptop screen/li liMove Word slightly /li liPlug the monitor back in /li liProblem solved/li /ol  <answer68844> I was puzzled and annoyed by this problem too in Mac Snow Leopard. The application (MS Word) has a solution. Open file that is not visible. Go to menu Window--Zoom Window, which then brings that file up front and center.  <answer89396> None of these worked, then I read about a trick to delete the plist file. That deleted everything including my registration for the app I was trying to gather the main window, which was open, when I last closed it.  Then I tried the following and succeeded: I changed the key MainWindowFrame to s.th. below my screen resolution, in my case:  precode&lt;key&gt;MainWindowFrame&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;**2237**&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;474&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;834&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;704&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  to:  precode&lt;key&gt;MainWindowFrame&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;**1000**&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;474&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;834&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;704&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  That finally did the trick!!!  <answer122152> I had the same problem and literally, just, clicked two times in the icon for the app/program I wanted to use and it brought it right to the center of my screen.   <answer139895> The easiest solution is to change the resolution of the screen, because this resets all window positions.   <answer228371> The solution I found is Window → Arrange all.  <answer229581> I found a workaround.  Spotlight -- Displays -- Scaled -- "More Space".  I was able to move the application and then restored to my original display.   <comment39885> Can you go to System PrefsDisplay and "Gather Windows"? <comment39886> I'm also a fan of [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) for your window-management needs (such as this one), but I realize that doesn't answer the question. :) <comment40685> @daviesgeek I could not find the **Gather Windows** button. Searching, I figured why: it exist _[only](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=8244216&postcount=19)_ when your MacBook has a monitor plugged in. <comment40689> Oh...that's right...too bad...I can't think of anything else. <comment48817> It works for me, thank you! <comment69093>  window is overflowing out of visible workspace range in a way that makes it unreachable <comment69102> It's pretty rare that a window would be bigger than the screen so that all edges would be outside it. Window  Zoom might work in even that case. <comment199845> `Gather Windows` only applies to the *System Preferences* windows you have open. <comment339927> That's a solid approach
