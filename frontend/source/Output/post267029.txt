Can't setup reminder or calendar appointment using Siri on Mac <body> Any idea why I can't setup a reminder or calendar appointment with Siri on the Mac? When I attempt to setup a reminder I just get her saying "One sec". When I press confirm after telling her to setup an appointment I get "Sorry Scott I can't do that". Any ideas? Is there something I have to do to get these useful features working?  <answer267049> In System Settings, stronggrant permissions/strong to access Calendar and Location data for Siri, then disable and re-enable Siri.
