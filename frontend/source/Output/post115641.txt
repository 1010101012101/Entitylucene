“All My Files” in Finder: How to list all files on mounted DASD instead of all local files? <body> I understand “All My Files” option in Finder lists local files only. Is there any way to list all files on mounted Directly Attached Storage Device (DASD) instead, please?   <answer115643> Not using the All My Files option, but yes you can, using your own search criteria.  ol liOpen your volume in Finder/li liSearch for Any Document:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C8oXu.png" width="350"/li liSet the search location to the name of the drive:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vMUbn.png" width="350"/li /ol  Alternatively, for all files (not just Documents like All My Files) you can set the search criteria by size:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xIm4m.png" width="550"  You can change the view to make it match the appearance of All My Files:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wiws9.png"
