What is the difference between Top Grossing and Top Paid in the App Store? <body> In App Store, What is the different between strongTop Grossing/strong and strongTop Paid/strong?  <answer32978> There are three categories: strongTop Free/strong, strongTop Paid/strong, and strongTop Grossing/strong.  In the strongTop Free/strong category, the apps with the most downloads that have a price of $0 make the list.  In the strongTop Paid/strong category, the apps with the most downloads that have a price greater than $0 make the list.  The strongTop Grossing/strong category lists the apps with the highest total revenue (that is, price * quantity sold + revenue from in-app purchases). A $50 app is likely to have fewer downloads than at $0.99 app. The strongTop Paid/strong list will likely include many inexpensive apps that get purchased often. The strongTop Grossing/strong category is to indicate which apps have the highest total spent on them.  <comment37738> I think the Top Grossing category also counts in-app purchases towards the revenue. <comment37740> @Heng-CheongLeong: That makes sense. Does it also include in-app purchases for free apps? <comment40034> Four of the apps in top-grossing right now cost $79.99 or more. <comment40068> @Thilo: That's correct, it measures total revenue including in app purchases and app price. There are several "Free" apps that feature on the top grossing list, this is due to the revenue generated by their in-app purchases.
