Why can't I delete messages from my IMAP account on my iPhone 4? <body> I have an iPhone 4 and have set up mail with an IMAP account. When I delete a message a popup says strongUnable to move message - The message could not be moved to the trash folder/strong.  How can I fix this?  <answer4051> Maybe the trash folder is not correctly set on your iPhone.  Depending on the email-provider, you may have to choose the correct "deleted" folder in your account settings on the iPhone.  (maybe the translations are not literally, i am using a German iPhone): Go to "Settings" - "Mail, contacts ...", choose your IMAP account, choose "account info", look at the bottom and choose "advanced".  Here you can choose which folder is your trash folder.  <answer23062> I was having a problem deleting an email that said "this message has not been downloaded from server." I couldn't move it to Trash either, even after affirming the prompt to "download message from server." I finally forwarded it to myself and was prompted to download message before sending. I answered yes. I then deleted the forwarded message and the original troublesome message and all is well.  <answer164883> I had this problem and the following fixed it on my iphone 6.  go to mail then mailboxes find "trash" and make sure the box is checked.  Solved my problem.  <comment3838> That fixed it. Thanks! <comment322385> [This option is not available in iOS 10.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/257734/4395)
