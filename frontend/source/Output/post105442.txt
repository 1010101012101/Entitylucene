OS X change Admin user to Standard user with command line <body> I would love to send a Unix command through ARD that will change a OS X admin user to a standard user. The only thing I found close is   precodesudo dscl . -delete /Groups/admin GroupMembership USERNAME /code/pre  which does remove the user from the list of admins, but they are still listed as an admin in the user preference panel, and can still use their account to authenticate for admin privileges.  <answer105443> Just fought this battle, you can drop the codedscl/code line and use the following;  Type the commandâ€¨:  precodesudo dseditgroup -o edit -d UserName -t user admin  /code/pre  Where codeUserName/code is their actual AD username.
