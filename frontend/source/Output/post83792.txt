Paste <TAB> into Mac OS X command line <body> I want to paste code&lt;TAB&gt;/code into command line, in order to execute codecut/code command with code&lt;TAB&gt;/code as the delimiter. Everytime I try to do it, it simulates clicking the tab key and completes the command with some file(-s) from the current directory.  Is there any solution (I've tried copying straight from text editor)?  Mac OS X 10.7.5, running bash.   <answer83799> You can insert a literal tab by pressing Ctrl-v (quoted-insert) and tab.  You can insert tabs in strings with code$'\t'/code:  precodecut -f2 &lt;&lt;&lt; $'aa\tbb' /code/pre  Or use pbpaste:  precodepbpaste | cut -f2 /code/pre  This makes tab just insert a tab:  precodebind '"\t": self-insert' /code/pre  If you use option as meta, adding this to ~/.inputrc would make ⌥⇥ insert a tab:  precode"\e\t": "\C-v\t" /code/pre  <comment96445> Is C-v, Command-v or Control-v? <comment96486> C-v is Control-v
