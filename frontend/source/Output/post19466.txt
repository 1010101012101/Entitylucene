Unable to mount an NFS share <body> I'm trying to access my (Synology) NAS share through NFS and always get the same issue.    First, I activated NFS support in my NAS:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3KFe.png" alt="NAS activated"  Then I set the permissions on the NAS:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWJmw.png" alt="NAS NFS permissions"  My MBP has the IP 192.168.1.109. From there it seems OK. a codeshowmount -e 192.168.1.2/code shows the list:br code Exports list on 192.168.1.2:br /volume1/video                      192.168.1.109br /volume1/homes                      192.168.1.109 /code  But unfortunately, my mount always fails: code GroundControl:/ ludo$ sudo mount -t nfs -o rw 192.168.1.2:/volume1/homes /Volumes/homebr mount_nfs: can't mount /volume1/homes from 192.168.1.2 onto /Volumes/home: Operation not permitted /code  The /Volume/home directory is created upfront.  Trying with a non-existing share on the NAS, for example em/volume1/qwerty/em gives a Permission denied error, which is OK.br But what is this Operation not permitted error?  Trying through emDiskUtilsNFS Mounts/em gives the same result.  What did I miss?  <answer20697> Finally found the solution in an old forum thread.       My solution was to mount with "-P" to force the use of a reserved port number, as described in mount_nfs(8) page.    The solution is then to use the code-P/code option to the codemount/code command.br Now works like a charm (but doesn't fix my initial issue!)  <answer77571> Or just use the "resvport" option with the codemount/code command.  precodemount -o resvport nasbox.local.com:/try /mnt /code/pre
