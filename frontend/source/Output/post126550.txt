How to make a duplicate of a photo on iPhone before I crop or edit it? <body> There are many times I want to crop a photo using iPhoto on iOS and post to Facebook, and then possibly crop it another way (like panoramic this time), and post to Facebook, but I don't want to lose the original.  Is there a way to make duplicates of the original and edit it using iPhoto on iOS?  strongP.S./strong I also found that when you crop a photo in the Photos app, the original is not lost.  You can simply re-crop it again (or un-crop it) to get a different cropping or get back the original.  But, it still might be good to have a duplicate if you want to keep 2 different ways of cropping the same photo.  <answer126557> iPhoto always keeps the original. When you go to the edit menu, there's a button to return to the original. And you can always preview the original by holding shift.   Of course you can manuelly use copy-paste or diplicate (cmd+d I believe) if you want to manually duplicate a picture.   <answer146801> This functionality is missing. As a workaround you can email or message the picture to yourself and save it again.  <answer162202> As of iOS 8 there is at least one commercial product which addresses this limitation.  Hopefully Apple will build-in such a function soon.  <answer163374> After this "Copy" action you can "Paste" a photo to any not-system album (not Panoramas or Photo Stream for example).  You can not paste to empty album (at least in 8.1.2, seems like a bug), but you can add any photo to this album on creation or by pressing "+" at the upper-left corner.  But sadly this options creates just a link to the photo, not a copy, so every change spreads to all of "copies" of this photo in other albums. This is just a way to tag photos. So email it...  <answer167647> Copy it and save it to a new album then make the edits   <answer182968> Here's a tested &amp; confirmed way to copy photos without downloading any other apps. You will however need wi-fi or wireless service at the time to do this.  ol liClick the photo, click share, select Message, and send it to yourself (your Apple ID)./li liThen, open Messages and click on the message you just sent yourself. Click on the image, then click Share, and then strongSave Image/strong./li liYou can repeat clicking strongShare-Save Image/strong, for as many copies of the photo as you want./li /ol  When you're done, go back to Photos and find the copies. Each photo is now an individual copy that can edited, cropped, etc. without the changes being applied to the other copies.  <answer195617> Simplest way--Choose your photo, then take a screen shot, and presto, a duplicate photo you can edit! Note that the screen shot will have a lower resolution than the original!  <answer196579> What I do is copy the photo and paste it into the notes app and then save it back to the camera roll, then we have a duplicate and we can edit one of them and still keep the original.  <answer211865> I was looking to make a Photo Editing Extension to Duplicate photos easily, but...  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duplicate-photo/id930534184?mt=8  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ayra8.jpg" alt="http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/9f/7a/46/9f7a466d-4c93-d541-507b-05725da1df82/screen322x572.jpeg"  ... it's already existing =/  <answer216135> Simply AirDrop it back and forth between iOS devices, provided you have two.  It's a kluge for sure, but once you've got the basics down, it's like the Trouble with Tribbles episode from Star Trek!!  <answer225641> I use the "Save to Photo Album" action in the app Workflow, as an extension.  <answer232048> As of iOS 9.3 you can choose to Duplicate photo directly. Pretty convenient.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ycIis.jpg" alt="The Duplicate button is shown after you tap on Sharing button"  <answer246435> I think this is a bit faster and simpler than any of the methods mentioned above:  ul liView the photo that you want to crop, zoom into it as much as you think is the area you want to crop. /li liHit Home button and Power button at the same time to take a screenshot -- new photo will be saved. /li liGo to photos and view the screenshot you took, crop it as you like (remove edges at least). /li /ul  Done!  <comment148278> i didn't downvote you, but is this for iPhoto on a Mac?  I am asking regarding on iPhone <comment148372> Oh, woops. Can you duplicate or copy a photo by holding the finger on it maybe? <comment171973> by the way, I found that after you cropped the photo, you can always crop it again to include more area of the original photo.  In other words, the original photo is kept on the iPhone <comment172952> @動靜能量 - Could you add that as an answer to your question. <comment187651> Keeping the original is not an accurate answer as you only have the ability to have one version of the picture. You cannot create & save 2 unique crops unless you duplicate the original (or the crop). <comment187776> I believe by keeping the original he meant that the file itself is untouched <comment261904> This is not ideal as the Messages app compresses photos. A better solution is to use email and send as "Actual size". <comment261905> This will reduce the quality of the image dramatically <comment279934> @JaydenLawson Not sure if that used to be a thing, or is maybe only a thing when using cellular data, but I just did it both ways over WiFi and the images are identical. <comment285146> @Ryan agreed - just tested it and found the same.
