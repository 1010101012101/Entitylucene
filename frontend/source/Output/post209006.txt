Boot Camp Windows partition lost after El Capitan upgrade <body> I upgraded through App Store, and after the upgrade, the boot select screen no longer shows my Windows partition, nor the recovery disk. Running codediskutil list/code yields the following:   precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *320.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            222.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data                         39.0 GB    disk0s4 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +221.6 GB   disk1                              Logical Volume on disk0s2                              9678D097-D642-4108-813B-E10AF9578FE3                              Unlocked Encrypted /code/pre  Disk Utility first aid passed with no error.   As far as I can remember, I allocated 100GB or so for the Windows partition. Now I wonder how I can get that back without reinstalling a clean Windows.

Had it on for the fist time while installing El Capitan. <comment252078> @klanomath Thanks for your comment.. I updated the question. <comment252079> Probably El Capitan hosed your Windows partition: There is a giant gap of non-allocated disk space (113699624 blocks = 58.2 GB) between your Recovery HD (3)  and the miserable remainders of your Windows partition (4). What does Boot Camp Assistant show after opening it? <comment252082> it just shows two options -- download software, or remove Windows 7 or a later version. When I select the latter and continue, it warns me about wiping out the entire HD and partition it as one disk OS X of 259 GB. Doesn't look good at all. @klanomath <comment252083> Indeed that doesn't look good. The 259 GB are also wrong. BCA should state ~319 GB. I have to search for a gpt listing showing a default Boot Camp install. <comment252267> Thanks, @klanomath. I trusted OS X too much and never made any backups while upgrading.. now the situation is really miserable. <comment252560> I have the exact same issue. After upgrading to El Capitan my Boot camp is lost. I did some stuff that Apple might not expect though. <comment252562> Did you do something similar before upgrading? I had expanded my Bootcamp partition but it looks like El Capitan has reverted the partition to original size? I created a 100GB partition but increased it using the following steps. 1) Disabled FileVault 2) Converted the disk from CS to JHFS+. 3) Resized the partition using Minitool in Windows. <comment252585> @JacobHamacher No. But I did turn on FileVault when asked during setup. There was no warning at all, as I recall. Before that, I didn't use FileVault.
