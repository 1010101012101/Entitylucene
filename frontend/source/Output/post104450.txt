Hotkey for new Finder window <body> On my old MacBook, I could hit kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd + kbdspace/kbd and get a new Finder window with the sidebar (Downloads, Documents, etc…).  On my new Mac, that same command only gives me a Spotlight window which excludes the sidebar.  Is there a way to get the hotkey shortcut going again so that I don't have to kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⇥ tab/kbd to the Finder each time to hit kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdN/kbd?  supI am on a Mac i5 MacBook Pro./sup  <answer104461> Press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd + kbdS/kbd to show the sidebar (or select strongView  Show Sidebar/strong from the Finder menubar).   <comment122935> If you want to assign a keyboard shortcut for focusing Finder (and opening a new window if there are no open windows), see [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20010/can-i-create-a-shortcut-to-open-a-specific-application-on-os-x/20116#20116) for different ways to assign keyboard shortcuts for opening applications.
