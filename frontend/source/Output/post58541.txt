Keyboard Shortcut To Switch Between Opened Windows <body> How do I switch between open windows?  kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd switches between opened applications, but for example, when I open preferences-window of BetterTouchTool I don't get it shown via kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd.  <answer58542> kbdCmd/kbd+kbd`/kbd will allow you to switch between the open windows of the current application. Very useful.  <answer58552> By default (on a clean install of Mountain Lion), there is a keyboard shortcut "Move focus to active or next window", kbd^/kbdkbdF4/kbd, which worked for activating the BetterSnapTool preference window (which is the same deal, activating a window in an app that doesn't have a dock icon).img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSeJR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer74978> Shortcut key to switch between opened windows is Alt+Tab  Regards Shefali  <answer90908> If you want to switch between windos within ONE application, you rather want to use the "Move focus to next window" command, 3 lines below the marked line in the screenshot above.  <comment67375> Yep, I'm familiar with this keyboard shortcut, however it won't help in this situation. <comment67391> @Anonymous What about CMD+? <comment67401> @Anonymous I was trying to write the tilda key, the one that is right above the tab key. <comment74172> Yep, and it does not work on a fresh install of Mountain Lion. I'm also used to the Cmd+` shortcut (Cmd+# on my Azerty keyboard). <comment87061> Are you sure you are not confusing OS X and Windows here? <comment107157> What a useful key combination!Thank you for posting this!
