How do I use my Dell V305 Printer with my Mac Air OS X Lion. <body> I would like to know how to use my Dell V305 Printer with my Mac Air OS X Lion? The printer is wireless, but I usually hook up the cable to my laptop (at least that's how I print from my PC). When I click ADD in Printer Set up, it states that software for the printer is not available from Apple, but to contact printer manufacturer.   <comment40188> Have you checked the manufacturer's website or contacted them for software?
