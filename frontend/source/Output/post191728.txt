Display dialog with current iTunes album cover <body> I would like to display with AppleScript a dialog that shows my current title, artist and album. In addiction to that the icon of the dialog should be the album cover of the current album.  Is that possible?  <answer192576> Yes it is. Here is what I came up with.
