Can you add up front size at Preview? <body> strongPreview/strong is a very useful application on OS X, for example, when I am previewing a .doc document, can I increase the preview's font size? kbdcommand/kbd+kbd+/kbd does not work.  <answer127694> Preview is not actually opening the document for formatting/editing.  It opens a image of it, so no you can not change the font size, but you can increase the size of the image it self.
