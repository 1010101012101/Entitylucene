iCloud Photo Library vs my photo stream <body> Just for my curiosity and knowledge,  Now that the iPhoto iCloud Library feature is available on both iOS and OS X devices, and if I understood good every time I take a picture, the picture goes to the iCloud and pushed back to all my devices, what is the purpose to keep the Upload to My Photo Stream feature? What are now the basic difference between the two services? Why someone should use one vice versa the other one? Or why someone should use only one of them?  Thank you so much and have a wonderful day.   <answer188534> iCloud Photo Library uploads every photo on every iDevice to iCloud and syncs then. My Photo Stream only saves the 1,000 most recent photos. Basically, the only advantage of My Photo Stream is that it doesn't count against your iCloud storage, whereas iCloud Photo Library does.  <answer188636> You'd still use it if you have devices that do not support iCloud Photo Library.
