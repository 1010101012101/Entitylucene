What's the name of the temperature sensor closest to the PCIe slots in a MacPro5,1? <body> What's the name of the temperature sensor closest to the PCIe slots in a MacPro5,1?  I'm concerned that an installed PCIe card is overheating.  <answer256896> This is the full list - from iStat Menus    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FjIOb.png" alt="enter image description here"  There isn't really one anywhere near the PCI slots that's also in the same compartment.  CPU, DIMM &amp; IOH are all in the lower compartment, Drive Bays &amp; PS are in the upper.   I've seen machines reporting a temperature for PCI Slot 1 - but these may have the original graphics cards in them... mine barely has an original anything.
