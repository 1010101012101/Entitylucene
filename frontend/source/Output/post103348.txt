software to create timeline from excel data for mac <body> I'm looking for a free or cheap product to create a timeline from an upload of an excel file, simple data (year and description). Any thoughts?  <answer103351> h2BEEDOCS Easy Timeline or Timeline 3D/h2  Both of BEEDOCS timeline creation software for Mac will let you import a tab-delimited file (which you could export your Excel file as) into a 2D or 3D timeline.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sux8w.jpg" alt="BEEDOCS Easy Timeline - Event Editor"  You can also include photos, audio, or movies in your events, as well as web links and 3D motion graphics.  h2Aeon Timeline/h2  You can also create timelines from data using Aeon Timeline:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78a2b.png" alt=""  <comment121639> What is the difference between your question and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9503/whats-a-good-mac-app-for-making-timelines-gantt-charts ? <comment121641> @patrix I was going to say the same thing, since the [original question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/revisions/9503/1) is almost identical to this one (without referring to the Excel file). However, since the edit referring to Gantt charts made to that question, a simple timeline of dates *is* a different questionâ€¦ <comment121647> Fair point, I would nevertheless prefer if the OP could add some details on what they are looking for and maybe also include a sample image.
