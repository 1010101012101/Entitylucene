iTunes not showing app update description texts <body> I have a very weird problem with iTunes lately. When I go to Apps â†’ Updates, all apps that show up there, don't have an update description text. The app is displayed, its version is displayed, vendor, size, etc., but no text. I tried to clear the cache from within iTunes, but no luck. This is how it looks like:   img src="https://cl.ly/image/2q1f2d1F3A1S/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-17%20at%2000.57.41.png" alt=""  I'd appreciate if someone could help me.  <comment178721> What version iTunes? <comment184286> Please answer this so everyone knows that it's a bug. <comment188439> The problem resolved itself, when Apple updated its App Store.
