How to get designated apps to open on designated desktops <body> I would like to get TextMate and Safari to open in the same desktop, but have looked in System Preferences and can't see where to do this?  Leopard and Snow Leopard had this in System Preferences, but I can't find it in Lion.  Thanks in advance for your help.  <answer37312> When you have strongat least two/strong spaces in Mission Control, you can access the necessary options via right-click on the app icon in the dock:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n6JUz.png" alt="enter image description here"
