Share Keyboard Shortcuts <body> I have about over 100 keyboard shortcuts for my mac, and I want to transfer all those shortcuts to my second computer. Is there a way to do this easily?  <answer224135> Unless this is included in a Time Machine backup (in which case you could restore it with Migration Assistant), then not easily.  See this answer and this answer.     The shortcuts that can be set in System Preferences  Keyboard    Keyboard Shortcuts  Application Shortcuts are stored in   code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code and the property lists   of applications (like code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist/code or   code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.chess/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.chess.plist/code).      The shortcuts for services are stored in   code~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist/code.   <answer224138> The best bet is to change some shortcuts while observing the content of your Preferences folder sorted by modification date.  In my system (10.7.5 Lion) the relevant files are emcom.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/em, emcom.apple.universalaccess.plist/em and empbs.plist/em as well as probably somehow related plists like emcom.apple.systempreferences.plist/em/emcom.apple.ServicesMenu.Services.plist/em.  If both of your Macs have the same system/apps installed simply copy the files you found.
