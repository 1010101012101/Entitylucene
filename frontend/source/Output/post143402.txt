FileMerge for comparing pdf files <body> Is it possible to use FileMerge to compare pdf files.   I found a post that describes the process, but after following every step I just can't seem to be able to compare two simple pdf files.   The preference for FileMerge look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aIdQ9.png" alt="FileMerge preferences"  And the script I wrote under code$HOME/Local/bin/code is simply:  precode#!/bin/sh pdftotext -layout -nopgbrk -enc UTF-8 "$1" - | iconv -c -f UTF-8 -t MacRoman /code/pre  even though I have also tried to replace codepdftotext/code by codexpdf-pdftotext/code as per one of the last comments in that post.   FileMerge tells me the two files I'm trying to compare are equal, but they're clearly not.
