Terminal : needs full path to execute a command <body> Let's suppose i have an application in code/Applications/MacPorts/KDE4/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp/code.  When i use codecd/code to reach the directory 'MacOS' and then issue the command codemyapp/code it says command not found.  But when i issue the command with the full path like code/Applications/MacPorts/KDE4/myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp/code it works.  I had the same problem with mysql inside xampp.  Why is that?  <answer74362> codebash/code in Terminal uses the content of code$PATH/code to look for executables. Usually code./code (for the current directory) is not part of code$PATH/code (primarily for security reasons), to run commands in the current directory type code./myapp/code.  <answer74363> This is because when you type "myapp" is not in the current path, just because you codecd/code into a directory does not mean it will be on the path to run the program.  You need to type ./myapp  or add "./" to your path so that your shell will look in the current directory for "myapp" etc.  <comment86367> I strongly recommend against adding `.` to `$PATH`. A simple malicious `ls` placed in a public directory can lead to a lot of problems. <comment86368> yes that was it. I hadn't thought of that but it is very logical. Both answers are the same. I didn't know which to accept so i accepted the one submitted first.
