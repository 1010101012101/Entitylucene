How can I generate a password-less version of a protected PDF? <body> I have a PDF file that has been password protected.  I know the password.  The password's only use, in our case, is to protect the PDF during email transmission.  Now that I have the PDF, I'd like to remove the password, as it is annoying to have to look-up and type it in every time I want to use the PDF.  In a pre-Lion version of Preview, I was able to print and "Save As PDF" to create a copy of the file that didn't have a password.  However, when I try the same maneuver in Lion, the "Save as PDF" entry is greyed-out.  Is there some other software (preferably free) that would let me save the PDF without the password?  Some other thing I can do to the file to enable Preview to "Save as PDF"?  <answer42225> Open the document in Preview, select File  Duplicate, enter the file location and save a copy.  You can do a similar thing with File  Export.  <answer134524> try "print to file" option :-)  <answer235610> Workaround (Working for most people) : Open the PDF in Chrome (or Firefox) and then Print it to PDF as destination.   <comment47989> +1, simple answer that just works! <comment105786> It keeps asking me for password saying "Without the owner password, you do not have permission to duplicate this document". I am on Mountain Lion, btw. <comment163995> Does not work for me. A workaround that actually works :  Open the PDF in Chrome (or Firefox) and then Print it to PDF as destination. <comment166165> it works on ubuntu 12.04, chromium browser <comment288196> @NitishUpreti for the love of god add that as an answer. That totally worked for me. I used Chrome btw.
