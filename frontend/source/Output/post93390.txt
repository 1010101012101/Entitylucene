Material thickness of Unibodies? <body> As a layman, I am currently working on a mechanical design for something like my own tablet/iPad case. I dream of having it milled from a block of aluminum. Now, I wonder what are the limits of the material. To give me an idea:  emWhat is the minimum material thickness that Apple uses for the cover of the back of the display in any of the Unibody products? Is there a honeycomb structure or similar on the back?/em  If there are precise 3D models of the Unibody shells available on the Internet, then a pointer to the resource would be more than adequate to answer my question!  <comment109579> You really are better to ask around http://www.ifixit.com. This place is more geared towards help than reverse engineering or design specifications. But for what it's worth, Apple likely uses 6061 allow in their designs (pure aluminum is never used, but rather a composite of different metals), which is often called "airplane grade" due to its application on aircrafts. The grade of aluminum supplies the strength, so no additional structure is needed for stability. You can actually measure the thickness quite easily if you remove the shell (most likely just shy of 1mm). <comment109589> Thanks for the insight and for your suggestion to look on ifixit, @cksum! Concerning measuring: I don't have a Macbook at my disposal that I can disassemble without voiding warranty. <comment109610> No problem feklee. Do contact the guys who run iFixit. Since they have personally broken down every known Apple product for the past decade, they might either have the info, or could find it for you. You can also take a look at the breakdowns and likely come close just guessing at the pics. Another alternative is to sweet talk an Apple Genius at one of their stores and see if they have an open one in the back they can have a look at. <comment109832> @cksum Just put a [question](http://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/131442/Where+to+find+low+profile+hinge) in the *Answers* section on their web site.
