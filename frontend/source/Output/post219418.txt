How do I edit keyboard shortcuts in Nano? <body> Is there a way to edit the keyboard shortcuts in Nano?  I would like to change strongemMove to next word/em/strong from strongRight/strong (kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd) and strongLeft/strong (kbdAlt/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd), to kbdAlt/kbd + kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd.  According to this thread on AskUbuntu, one should be able to edit code/etc/nanorc/code. However, on my OS X computer, that file is empty except for this line:   precodeset nowrap /code/pre  Assuming that this is the only file there is, how could I override the keyboard settings here?  <answer219424> You can find a description of commands/settings allowed in code/etc/nanorc/code by running codeman nanorc/code.   OS X 10.11 uses nano 2.0.6 which doesn't seem to support key rebindings.  <answer281580> If you install a more up-to-date version of nano, it has improved keyboard navigation. In nano 2.7, the move word shortcut is codectrl+left/right/code. So you might not even need to do keybindings if you are satisfied with codectrl/code instead of codealt/code.  ol liInstall homebrew: https://brew.sh//li liInstall nano: codebrew install nano/code/li /ol  If you really want codealt/code, then keep reading.  ol liIf using Mac Terminal, you will need to enable the codeUse Option as Meta key/code setting. Otherwise the codealt/code key won't work./li licode/etc/nanorc/code might be ignored, depending on the flags when your codenano/code was compiled. You can use code~/.nanorc/code instead, that will work for sure./li liAdd these lines to code~/.nanorc/code. (It seems that codenanorc/code does not allow left/right arrows for keybindings, so I chose code,/code and code./code since they are the same keys as code&lt;/code and code&gt;/code.  precodebind M-, prevword main bind M-. nextword main /code/pre/li /ol  Now codealt+,/code and codealt+./code will move to prev/next words.  You can find the full list of commands here: https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.7/nanorc.5.html#REBINDING%20KEYS . (You may want to find the exact version of your codenano/code if not v2.7).
