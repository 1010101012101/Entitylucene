Running Ubuntu on MacBook Pro 2015 â€” run natively (dual boot) or run in virtual machine for longer battery life? <body> I currently use Ubuntu in a virtual machine, using VirtualBox software on my host operating system, OS X, on my MacBook Pro 2015.  However, the battery life drains quickly when Ubuntu is used continuously. The battery life only lasts about four hours at the best. If I do not run Ubuntu, the battery life would be about seven hours.  Will the battery life be longer if I run Ubuntu natively (dual boot), or if I run Ubuntu in a virtual machine, with VirtualBox software?  <answer237002> Booting Ubuntu on a dual boot partition has a similar battery life to OS X, perhaps slightly shorter, due to less efficient optimization for the MacBook Pro's hardware.  In a virtual machine, despite lots of "clever" optimizations and CPU hardware virtualization features, there are two complete operating systems, with two kernels, and two display managers* running. There is no way around the fact that these require significantly more processing power, thus, sucking up more battery life.  If you want longer battery life in Ubuntu, try disabling the eye candy. (This, of course, is assuming the virtual machine is not running headless.)  <answer237004> Yes, running Ubuntu natively (dual booting) may be a better way, but you will lose all "pros" of your MacBook Pro 2015 (Mac OS X).  There is another way of "using Ubuntu," which is Docker. I bet you have heard of it, but you may not know that the latest Docker beta uses a native virtualization mechanism, and it does not need VirtualBox, or any other virtual machine software, anymore.  <answer264268> Note that it looks like the VirtualBox in particular has very poor battery efficiency when compared to other virtual machine emulators. I came across this page below that benchmarked different vms and found that running Windows in Parallels or Fusion on a Mac results in the battery lasting nearly twice as long as VirtualBox.

I said dual boot is better, and I just gave him another option <comment291027> What kind of information are you looking for which is not already included in the answers given on May 3rd? <comment291040> Merely a confirmation - I need a reliable opinion/answer on the subject, as it is for professional use. <comment291045> Given how the site works, people usually refrain from answering on their own if an existing answer already states whatever they would have answered. <comment291049> Out of curiosity..what are you hoping to do in Linux that you can't do in OS X? <comment291052> @patrix Certainly, but sometimes a question is overlooked... <comment291108> Have you tested this side-by-side? Which Mac? Which display drivers? My intuition tells me that if you limit VirtualBox to the embedded graphics chip on a dual-GPU MacBook, you'll wind up with longer battery life as OS X can optimize better <comment291143> @Allan Ubuntu on Mac holds a setup similar to an Ubuntu server, and is used to test new developments and configuration settings. <comment291146> It is true I have only tested on the single-GPU 2012 Retina Macbook Pro 13", so that may be the case, but there are some Ubuntu packages that allow switching between embedded and discrete graphics cards on the fly while booted into linux (e.g. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics) <comment291744> Totally out of the scope of your question, but you should look into Vagrant, particularly providers for hosted VMs. If you're primarily using Ubuntu to test deployment, it's super nice to have repeatable, disposable environments, and your battery life won't suffer at all. <comment291746> @JayThompson Thanks for the tips. Although I don't really see how Vagrant can spare some battery life if a VM runs underneath(?) <comment291748> Out of the box, Vagrant just runs VMs locally, but you can use plugins to automate provisioning VMs on hosted platforms, such as Digital Ocean or AWS. You can run a hosted VM for pennies a day on either platform. <comment291877> Ok...just chiming in here with my IT Management hat on as someone who has to sit through countless demos, with a little perspective....  If you are doing *testing* of some sort of application or configuration, how important is battery life; really?  Are you testing configs in an area with no access to AC?  If you are *testing* as you say, your #1 priority is environment, then ease of use, then battery life; in that order.  Ok...Mgmt hat off, propeller hat back on. <comment292124> If you need this professionally as for any benchmark you have to measure it yourself
