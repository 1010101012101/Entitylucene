You cannot partition an external disk, a RAID disk or an internal disk on which FileVault encryption is in progress <body> I'm trying to Boot Camp my Mac Pro (Late 2013, MacPro6,1).     strongYou cannot partition an external disk, a RAID disk or an internal disk on which FileVault encryption is in progress./strong   Restart your computer using an internal disk that is not part of a RAID set or try it again after FileVault has completed.   Well, this is an internal SSD (an OWC Aura), and there's only one intentional partition; so I don't know why it's telling me this.  precode&gt; diskutil list /dev/disk0 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.9 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Kate's HD               1.9 TB     disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3  &gt; diskutil corestorage info disk0 disk0 is not a CoreStorage disk  &gt; diskutil info disk0    Device Identifier:        disk0    Device Node:              /dev/disk0    Whole:                    Yes    Part of Whole:            disk0    Device / Media Name:      OWC Aura SSD     Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)     Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)     File System:              None     Content (IOContent):      GUID_partition_scheme    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 PCI    SMART Status:             Not Supported     Total Size:               1.9 TB (1920080281600 Bytes) (exactly 3750156800 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)     Device Location:          External    Removable Media:          No     Solid State:              No    Virtual:                  No    OS 9 Drivers:             No    Low Level Format:         Not supported  &gt; diskutil info disk0s2    Device Identifier:        disk0s2    Device Node:              /dev/disk0s2    Whole:                    No    Part of Whole:            disk0    Device / Media Name:      Kate's New HD     Volume Name:              Kate's HD     Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /     File System Personality:  Journaled HFS+    Type (Bundle):            hfs    Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended (Journaled)    Journal:                  Journal size 147456 KB at offset 0x37e2000    Owners:                   Enabled     Partition Type:           Apple_HFS    OS Can Be Installed:      Yes    Recovery Disk:            disk0s3    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 PCI    SMART Status:             Not Supported    Volume UUID:              A22B65B2-1BAF-3561-B295-EF8343111867    Disk / Partition UUID:    B85D962F-C97C-4C64-99AC-FD6C2F47F173     Total Size:               1.9 TB (1919220523008 Bytes) (exactly 3748477584 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        710.0 GB (710019452928 Bytes) (exactly 1386756744 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes    Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         No     Device Location:          External    Removable Media:          No     Solid State:              No /code/pre  What steps can I take to install Windows on this volume? Preferably, I'd like to make Bootcamp “just work.”  <answer257178> Install the Aura SSD for Mac Pro driver and you should be good (direct d/l link).  It's obviously required for use with OS X Boot Camp utility.  <comment321016> Boot Camp Assistant will not act on an external disk and for some reason the OWC Aura SSD is showing as an external as noted by the output of `diskutil list`, it states: `/dev/disk0 (external, physical):` <comment321047> Wow. How did I not know about this. You're excellent! (I'll mark this as accepted as soon as I test this.)
