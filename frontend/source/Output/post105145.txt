What are the default special folder names for IMAP accounts in Mail.app (like Drafts, Junk, Sent)? <body> I'm setting up my own email server. Clients will connect to this server using IMAP.  Nowadays it's possible to map the correct 'special' folders on the server to the local client (like Drafts, Junk, and Sent). However, because the majority of the devices connecting to my server will use Mail.app (or Mail on iOS), it'd be nice if the default folder names on the server correspond to the names Mail.app uses (so I don't have to remap the folders on all devices).  Therefore, my question is: what are the special folders names Mail.app uses by default?  <answer105146> I created an empty IMAP account and added it to Mail.app and Notes.app on my Mac running OS X Mountain Lion. After saving some messages, all default folders were created by Mail.app. Then I connected to the IMAP server using Terminal and listed all folders:  precodeA1 LIST "" "%" * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "Sent Messages" * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "Junk" * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "Archive" * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "Deleted Messages" * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "Notes" * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "Drafts" * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "INBOX" A1 OK List completed. /code/pre  As you can see in the raw output, the exact default folder names are as follows:  ul liINBOX/li liDrafts/li liSent Messages/li liJunk/li liDeleted Messages/li liArchive/li liNotes/li /ul  After updating my email server to create these folder for new IMAP accounts by default, I connected a new account to my Mac. As hoped, Mail.app and Mail on iOS automatically used these special folders (I only had to enable "Store junk messages on the server" on Mac).  hr  For those using Dovecot as well, this is the resulting configuration file with the default folders included (code/etc/dovecot/conf.d/15-mailboxes.conf/code):  precodenamespace inbox {   mailbox Drafts {     auto = subscribe     special_use = \Drafts   }    mailbox "Sent Messages" {     auto = subscribe     special_use = \Sent   }    mailbox Junk {     auto = subscribe     special_use = \Junk   }    mailbox "Deleted Messages" {     auto = subscribe     special_use = \Trash   }    mailbox Archive {     auto = subscribe     special_use = \Archive   }    mailbox Notes {     auto = subscribe   } } /code/pre  <answer201346> The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defines that in a proper RFC, the RFC 6154. There you will find a list of special use mailbox denominations:  precode   \All       This mailbox presents all messages in the user's message store.       Implementations MAY omit some messages, such as, perhaps, those       in \Trash and \Junk.  When this special use is supported, it is       almost certain to represent a virtual mailbox.     \Archive         This mailbox is used to archive messages.  The meaning of an         "archival" mailbox is server-dependent; typically, it will be         used to get messages out of the inbox, or otherwise keep them         out of the user's way, while still making them accessible.     \Drafts         This mailbox is used to hold draft messages -- typically,         messages that are being composed but have not yet been sent.  In         some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,         containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with         the "\Draft" message flag.  Alternatively, this might just be         advice that a client put drafts here.     \Flagged         This mailbox presents all messages marked in some way as         "important".  When this special use is supported, it is likely         to represent a virtual mailbox collecting messages (from other         mailboxes) that are marked with the "\Flagged" message flag.     \Junk         This mailbox is where messages deemed to be junk mail are held.         Some server implementations might put messages here         automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice to a         client-side spam filter.     \Sent         This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that have been         sent.  Some server implementations might put messages here         automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice that a         client save sent messages here.     \Trash         This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been deleted or         marked for deletion.  In some server implementations, this might         be a virtual mailbox, containing messages from other mailboxes         that are marked with the "\Deleted" message flag.         Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client that         chooses not to use the IMAP "\Deleted" model should use this as         its trash location.  In server implementations that strictly         expect the IMAP "\Deleted" model, this special use is likely not         to be supported. /code/pre
