Color picker as app in Yosemite <body> As of upgrading to yosemite the apple script codechoose color/code no longer works. The color picker app launches but the eyedropper doesn't function. Does anyone know a work-around for this?  <answer173707> It's probably a bug, but there's a strange workaround. After highlighting the emEyedropper/em icon, click and drag on the color next to it on the left.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FaU12.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <answer196410> You can download application Color Picker and save follow AppleScript code as an Service(use Automator to create).  precodeon run {input, parameters}     --click button to select color from screen     tell application "System Events"         set isRunning to (name of processes) contains "Color Picker"         if not isRunning then             set front_app to (path to frontmost application as Unicode text)             --open Color Picker             do shell script "open -a \"Color Picker\""             delay 2             display dialog "Application Color Picker is running now, please try again" buttons {"OK"} default button 1         else             tell process "Color Picker"                 tell window 1                     click checkbox 1                 end tell                 set frontmost to true             end tell         end if     end tell     return input end run /code/pre  <comment204437> Nice find! Strangely, the eye dropper will appear for 1-2 seconds after you quit but it's futile, by then the dialog has disappeared and the color lost forever.
