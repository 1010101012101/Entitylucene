Ports closed on macOS Sierra Can't Use Apple Services -- Terminal Help? <body> strongOS:/strong Sierra 10.12.2br strongSystem:/strong Macbook11,3 MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB TAM.  I cannot use Messages to sign into my iMessage account. I get:     An error occurred during authentication.   This has been for over a month and I have gone to the Apple store and called support. Support passed it to engineering and it faded away. This is the error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z5RgG.png" alt="image"  All of the ports seem to be blocked, or at least they do not show up on a port scan out of Network Utility. When I use codelsof -i | grep http/codeall I see are Chrome windows which happen to be open.   I left off last time with my pf file being disabled. So that's not it. Any ideas?  Note: I was troubleshooting earlier and made some leeway. This is not the same question as earlier, it has advanced. I am now specifically looking for terminal commands.  <answer269141> Check the ports. This might help -- not sure how to proceed after: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202078  <comment339008> I am aware of that but still unsure how to open the ports.
