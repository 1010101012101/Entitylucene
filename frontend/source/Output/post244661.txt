applescript help <body> I'm trying to make a math addition program, and I have a few questions.   ol liHow do I make it so when it asks the question, it says it on the same dialog box? Such as: "What is the answer of x and y" instead of "what is the answer of x" followed by a new dialog "and y"?/li liIt returns nothing when you type the correct answer in. I want it so when you type in the correct answer it displays "correct" or "Goodjob!", and when you get it wrong it says "Incorrect" or "Try Again"./li /ol  Code:  precodeset num1 to (random number from 0 to 100) set num2 to (random number from 0 to 100) set answer to num1 + num2 display dialog "What is the answer of " &amp; num1 if text returned of (display dialog "and " &amp; num2 default answer "") = answer then display dialog "correct" /code/pre  <answer244666> A few things:  ol liThere should be two dialogs that get displayed:  ul liOne for the question, which should be just one string of text. This will have the codedefault answer/code./li liOne for the result/li /ul/li liIt is not returning/displaying anything because all the answers are "incorrect" and incorrect answers are not triggering anything. To fix this:  ul liYou will need to convert the user input codetext returned/code to a number for comparison with codeanswer/code/li liYou will have to catch incorrect answers using codeelse/code to display the "incorrect" dialog./li /ul/li /ol  The result:  precodeset num1 to (random number from 0 to 100) set num2 to (random number from 0 to 100) set answer to num1 + num2 set question to ("What is the answer of " &amp; num1 &amp; " and " &amp; num2) set dialog to (display dialog question default answer "") if text returned of dialog as number = answer then     display dialog "correct" else     display dialog "incorrect" end if /code/pre  Furthermore, if you wish to allow the user to re-try on incorrect attempts, you will need to use a loop that ends on a correct attempt.  <comment301591> The resulting code seems correct to me! upvoted answer.
