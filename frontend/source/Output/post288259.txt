Remove animation/delay on Command+Tab <body> Is there a way to completely remove the fade (or slide) animation when you switch (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd) to a full-screen app that is on a different space? There is a noticeable delay (and jerkiness) with the animation during which further presses of kbd⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd have no effect. This continues for a fraction of a second even after the animation has finished.  It's very annoying and disruptive to my workflow if keypresses are simply ignored by the OS.
