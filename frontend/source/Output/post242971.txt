Whst facetime data captured <body> On the newest iPhone, do cell phone carriers have access to FaceTime call data (such as which caller initiated and ended a FaceTime call)?  <answer242985> FaceTime only needs Internet connection for audio and video calls therefore the only data your carrier receives is what server you connected to, which I don't think is what you are looking for. strongYou/strong are the only one having access to the FaceTime logs.  <comment299055> It's unclear what you're asking. Can you please clarify what exactly the issue is and what steps you've taken so far to resolve it? <comment299088> I know on the device it shows who initiated the cloud is there a way to find out who ended the call <comment299107> It was either you or the other person, and most applications for communication don't show such information because it seems a little unnecessary. Don't you think it would be much easier to ask the other person whether they were the one who ended the call? <comment299131> Is there a way to determine who ended/hung up  a facetime call.
