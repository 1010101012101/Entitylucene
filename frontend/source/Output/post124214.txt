iTunes remembers my friend's iPhone from when he plugged it in to recharge <body> Every time my friend's iPhone is on the same WiFi network, iTunes asks me if I want to update his phone's OS and then later asks if I want to update his carrier profile or something like that. How can I keep this from happening?  I'm on Mavericks, and this previous question doesn't help and this Mavericks specific question seems to be asking for something different.  His device does not appear in codeiTunes &gt; Preferences &gt; Devices/code, but does show up in codeFile &gt; Devices/code (even when he isn't on the same WiFi network)  strongNew Information:/strong It seems like his device appearing in codeFile &gt; Devices/code was just because that menu keeps the last device connected around. Now that my phone has connected it is the only device in that menu.  <answer130272> Make sure 'Sync with this device over WIFI' in the summary tab is not selected.  <comment145209> Is his account logged in the iTunes store? <comment145211> @Robuust no, it's my account still <comment152635> "Even when isn't on the same wifi network", thus impossible <comment152636> This does not provide an answer to the question.

Thus you misread the issue.
