Microphone not working together with speaker in Skype/Viber calls on iPhone 5 <body> I am trying to make video calls via Skype or Viber on iPhone 5 but the other side doesn't hear me if I use the phone speakers. When I turn them off and use normal phone audio, then it works fine.   Same if I just make audio calls and turn on speaker -- the mic goes off, then turn speakers off and the mic works fine again. Not sure how to solve it.   The apps have permission to access the microphone.   I will try to use bluetooth speakers, but I would prefer to fix the problem so I don't have to use anything extra.  <comment341738> @bmike duplicate? I have mic not working, not the speaker which works fine btw. <comment341754> My apologies. Still could b software so checking with the app developer might be a good idea.
