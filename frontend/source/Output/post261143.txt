hard drive times out ejecting and mounting <body> My external hard drive has ceased to appear in finder and the desktop, has frozen out disk utility, and when I try to force mount it or eject it from my computer it times out.  strongHere is the disk info/strong   precodeDevice Identifier:        disk2    Device Node:              /dev/disk2    Whole:                    Yes    Part of Whole:            disk2    Device / Media Name:      My Passport 0820     Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)     Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)     File System:              None     Content (IOContent):      GUID_partition_scheme    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 USB    SMART Status:             Not Supported     Total Size:               2.0 TB (2000365289472 Bytes) (exactly 3906963456 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)     Device Location:          External    Removable Media:          No     Virtual:                  No    OS 9 Drivers:             No    Low Level Format:         Not supported /code/pre  strongThis is the mounting and ejecting time out/strong  precodediskutil mount /dev/disk2 Volume on disk2 timed out waiting to mount  diskutil eject /dev/disk2 Volume timed out while waiting to eject /code/pre  strongWhen I attempt to verify or repair this happens (I have it partitioned so I'll show both)/strong:  precodediskutil verifyVolume disk2s2 Started file system verification on disk2s2 My Passport [ \   \   \   \   \   \   \   \   \   \   \   \   \   \   ] **&lt;===this just stays there as if loading but never moves on or finishes**  diskutil verifyVolume disk2s3 Started file system verification on disk2s3 My Passport Backup Verifying file system File system check exit code is 8 Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed Underlying error: 8: POSIX reports: Exec format error /code/pre  This last one is the issue partition I think. it is my backup partition and I've been using it for Time Machine which I heard was iffy on a partitioned drive. This is also the partition that doesn't appear at all when I plug in the drive to a friend's macbook. the "My Passport" partition appears fully opened and accessible on other MacBooks and on the rare occasion opens normal on my own computer.  strongI'll also show the disk as it appears under "list" just in case it helps./strong   precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:       Microsoft Basic Data My Passport             1.0 TB     disk2s2    3:                  Apple_HFS My Passport Backup      999.7 GB   disk2s3 /code/pre
