Windows taskbar in Parallels VM <body> I'm running Windows 7 in Coherance mode in Parrellels desktop, and have the task bar visible at the bottom of the screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JGnOO.png" alt="enter image description here" Is it possible to move the task bar down, behind the Mac Dock, without turning on Dock hiding?  Like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRKOk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer22751> As far as I know, you cannot, because the dock tells the window server to reduce the windows max height to : screen height - dock current unmagnified size.   So the taskbar (which is in a window), is automatically placed on top on the dock.
