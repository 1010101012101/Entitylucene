Disable scrolling in iCal and iTunes when apps aren't selected <body> Sometimes I'll have iCal or iTunes open alongside another app, and I'll accidentally scroll up or down while the mouse is hovering over iCal or iTunes and it will actually scroll even though neither of the apps are selected.   How do I disable scrolling on iCal and iTunes when the app isn't selected?
