My Mac isn't locking when I put it to sleep <body> If I go code -&gt; Sleep/code or even hold the power button, my Mac goes to sleep but when I go to wake it up I immediately see the screen I'd put it to sleep on. Before I was asked for my password again upon waking my Mac. I know that you can quickly tap a key after using the power button shortcut to prevent it going to sleep and you won't be locked out, but even after having my Mac in sleep all night last night and waiting a few seconds or minutes before attempting to wake it today I'm not prompted for my password which worries me because I have sensitive information throughout my Mac.  I emhave/em just deleted everything in code~/Library/Preferences//code in hopes it would fix bugs. Was that a mistake? Could that be the reason I'm having this issue? Should I go ahead and restore my machine to prevent other weird bugs which may have come up because of that?  <answer173467> Have you set the password timeout value in System Preferences?        -- System Preferences -- Security &amp; Privacy -- General -- Require password (x minutes) after sleep or screen saver begins   <answer173468> In System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General, make sure you've checked "Require password [x seconds] after sleep or screen saver begins":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1moZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment204071> Deleting EVERYTHING in ~/Library/Preferences is a **bad** idea. In System Preferences  Security & Privacy  General, do you have the "Require password [x seconds] after sleep or screen saver begins" checkbox checked? <comment204072> That was the problem! Thanks. I had a feeling it was a setting neatly hidden away in System Preferences! I'm also never deleting all of `~/Library/Preferences` again. Do you want to post this as an answer so I can close this question? <comment204075> @icondaemon has already helped me with this and found this as the solution. Thank you for your answer! <comment324793> Any idea why this wouldn't work? It was working on the previous version of Sierra but after updating to 10.12.1 it no longer asks for a password. Sometime if I go into these settings and toggle it off and on again it works but does not persist forever. Seems like a pretty major security flaw. <comment325552> @Steiny I had the exact same problem after upgrading 10.12.1. Doing the following fixed the problem. In System  Preferences  Security & Preferences, uncheck 'Require Password .. after sleep or Screen Saver begins." Put the computer into sleep for a while. Wake it up, go to the same screen and check 'Require Password .. after sleep or screen saver begins." <comment343943> I too had this problem in 10.12.3. Toggling “Require password” did not fix it. It persisted even after a reboot. I changed the “5 seconds” to “Immediate”, put the computer to sleep, and it worked. I was then able to change it back to “5 seconds” and it worked again. Preferences corruption? In any case this is a **severe** security vulnerability. There should be no way the password lock ever fails. Especially since you won’t know it failed until the next time you open your computer. <comment349102> @DilipRajBaral: Thank you. Your answer worked for me.
