List of Apple Watch Workouts and Metrics <body> According to Apple, there are 12 different workouts: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9RZaV.png" alt="" The screenshot only shows 4. strongWhat are all 12 workouts?/strong  Also, Apple says you can select up to 5 metrics. strongWhat are all the different metrics?/strong  <answer257170> The 12 workout types are:  ul liCycling (Indoor &amp; Outdoor)/li liRun (Indoor &amp; Outdoor)/li liWalk (Indoor &amp; Outdoor)/li liSwim (Pool &amp; Open Water)/li liElliptical/li liRower/li liStair-Stepper/li liOther (these can be labeled as various activities like emStrength Training/em, but the label is purely cosmetic—it has no incidence on calorie computations)/li /ul  The various metrics are:  ul liDuration/li liCurrent Pace &amp; Speed/li liAverage Pace &amp; Speed/li liDistance/li liLaps/li liActive Calories/li liTotal Calories/li liHeart Rate/li /ul  They are not all available for every workout type. For instance, strongPace/strong is available for strongRun/strong/strongWalk/strong, while strongCycling/strong may show your strongSpeed/strong.  strongSwims/strong cannot display strongCurrent Pace/strong, only strongAverage Pace/strong.  strongLaps/strong are only available during strongPool Swims/strong, whereas stationary machine workouts (such as strongElliptical/strong and strongIndoor Cycling/strong) cannot display strongDistance/strong-related metrics (eg. strongSpeed/strong).  strongPace/strong and strongDistance/strong calculations for strongIndoor Walks/strong/strongRuns/strong are dependent on how well you’ve calibrated your WATCH, and require that you swing your arms throughout the workout. Holding onto the handlebars will cause WATCH to think you are not exercising.  strongDuration/strong, strongActive/strong/strongTotal Calories/strong and strongHeart Rate/strong are available for all workout types.  strongCalorie/strong computations are calibrated over time, as you wear and use your WATCH. They factor in both your heart rate and the weight you’ve recorded in the strongHealth/strong app.  <answer265115> As of watchOS version 3.1, there are twelve workout types.  Each workout type has a default sequence of metrics that the watch displays when using the "multiple metric" workout view. One can edit this sequence, adding or removing metrics and rearranging their order. Note, though, that once you edit the metrics sequence for a workout type, there's no easy way to revert to the default sequence. In the interest of allowing safer customization, let's document the default sequences here, by workout type.   hr  strongOutdoor Walk/strong  ul liDuration/li liActive Calories/li liHeart Rate/li liDistance/li /ul  strongOutdoor Run/strong  ul liDuration/li liCurrent Pace/li liHeart Rate/li liDistance/li /ul  strongOutdoor Cycle/strong  ul liDuration/li liCurrent Speed/li liHeart Rate/li liDistance/li /ul  strongIndoor Walk/strong  ul liActive Calories/li liTotal Calories/li liHear Rate/li liDistance/li /ul  strongIndoor Run/strong  ul liActive Calories/li liTotal Calories/li liHear Rate/li liDistance/li /ul  strongIndoor Cycle/strong  ul liDuration/li liActive Calories/li liTotal Calories/li liHeart Rate/li /ul  strongElliptical/strong  ul liDuration/li liActive Calories/li liTotal Calories/li liHeart Rate/li /ul  strongRower/strong  ul liDuration/li liActive Calories/li liTotal Calories/li liHeart Rate/li /ul  strongStair Stepper/strong  ul liDuration/li liActive Calories/li liTotal Calories/li liHeart Rate/li /ul  strongPool Swim/strong  ul liDuration/li liActive Calories/li liLaps/li liDistance/li /ul  strongOpen Water Swim/strong  ul liDuration/li liActive Calories/li liAverage Pace/li liDistance/li /ul  strongOther/strong  ul liDuration/li liActive Calories/li liTotal Calories/li liHeart Rate/li /ul
