My iMac boots but the screen doesn't work <body> My iMac boots(i can hear the jingle and the CD drive) but the screen doesn't work. Is the screen working and I closed the screen from software by some means.   Model is  iMac12,1 (MC309XX/A) if I press some keys I can hear some sounds.   I have reset the PRAM but it still does the same.  Does someone happen to know this situation?  <answer103198> I'd first try increasing the brightness. kbdF2/kbd or kbdfn/kbd + kbdF2/kbd (depending on user preference settings for the function keys)is the hot key for brightness on the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard.  If that doesn't work, a trip to the genius bar or a repair center would be my next step.
