Force QuickTime Player to auto-play files <body> I want QuickTime Player to auto-play a file when I execute that file from Finder.  The default behaviour is to simply load the file and wait for you to press play.  I found a default pref that you can set to force QuickTime X to play movie files automatically.  precodedefaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGPlayMovieOnOpen 1 /code/pre  How can you force QuickTime to play all its files automatically, regardless of their type (mp3, wav, aac, etc)  <answer242031> Using the default will command QuickTime to start playback of the loaded file.  precodedefaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGPlayMovieOnOpen 1 /code/pre  It's not file specific, or movie specific. It will play all files, regardless of type if you run this command, and restart QuickTime.
