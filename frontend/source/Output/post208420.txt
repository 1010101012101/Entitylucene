bash: ping: command not found <body> My shell can't find ping.  precode$ ping -bash: ping: command not found $ uname -r 14.5.0 $ echo $PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/Users/alex/.cabal/bin $ which ping $  /code/pre  However, codeman ping/code works and displays the manual page for ping.  Is it named something different on OSX?  Or is there an alternative I should use?  <comment251389> You are missing `/sbin` in your PATH variable. <comment251390> If you run `/usr/libexec/path_helper` does the path change? (and is ping found) <comment251391> I'm going to point this to a canonical "my path variable is messed up" and if you don't find a solution there, let's edit the body of the question to explain which answer was rejected and get some more detail... <comment251411> @bmike yep, that helped, as did fd0's suggstions about `/sbin`.  Shall I delete the question? <comment251414> @hoosierEE No - we actually love "closed questions" since someone searching google might use your words as opposed to the words on the duplicate. Also - if you find an edge case, it's better to reopen this after an edit is made to the post.
