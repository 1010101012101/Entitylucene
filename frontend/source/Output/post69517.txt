MacBook Pro Unable to connect to wireless internet at home <body> I am unable to connect to my home wireless internet using my MacBook Pro. I am not the most computer savvy person and my kids are off to college, so now I am helpless. But here is what I know:  ul liMy iPad, iPhone, and PC work perfectly. /li liNetwork is detected by my Mac "5WIRE525"./li liI checked the Proxy settings and none are checked./li liUsing Assistant, "airport" setting shows green light./li liI have tried changing the type from WEP, WAP, WAP2, etc. none work./li liAfter selecting my network, I am promted to enter my password, after this step I get a message indicating that I have entered the wrong password, or network is not working (again, my other devices work fine)./li liAfter checking and reseting options, I take my Mac back to Starbucks and other public places and it works perfectly. /li /ul  <comment80765> Are you absolutely certain that you are typing in the password correctly?  Sometimes it helps to type it out somewhere you can see it (in a blank textedit document, perhaps), then copy and paste it into the password field.
