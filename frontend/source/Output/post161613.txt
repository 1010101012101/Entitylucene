Two versions of the same app in Launchpad <body> How can I have two versions of the same app listed in Launchpad?  For example, I have both Processing 1.5 and Processing 2.0 installed. Only one shows up at once - is it possible to have both?  <answer161621> You can rename them in the Applications folder. I guess both appear there as "Processing", give different names to them.  <answer161629> Simply add the version numbers to the Applications' names in the Applications folder. You can do this by clicking the Application icon, then clicking the title underneath. I have three copies of Xcode in Launchpad like this.  <answer161634> Yes is possible to have two or more versions from the same application.  In order to work, you should rename your apps on Applications folder:  precode /Applications/Processing-1.5  /Applications/Processing-2.0 /code/pre  The main issue with this, is that usually both apps will share configuration files, and sometimes will be a problem.  <comment213412> If one of the below answers has solved your issue, please mark it as the correct answer to move it out of the "Unanswered" section.
