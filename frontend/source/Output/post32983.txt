RAM intermittently not recognized <body> My MBP will sometimes drop 4 of the 8G of RAM I have after recovering from sleep or a reboot.  One (or more) restarts later I'll have all 8G again.  Is this a memory stick going bad?  Could it be something worse?  <answer32985> Yes it could easily easily be a bad connection on the ram chip or just bad connection of the RAM stick with connector on the motherboard. Try to clean RAM connectors with a gum eraser first.  To test memory under load you may also use Memtest86+ CD if your MBP is Core 2 Duo one or Apple Hardware Test from included CD if yours is "Core i" one.  <comment37840> How does one clean the RAM bays with a gum eraser? The slots are very tiny. I might go in there with compressed air. <comment37842> @xanadont I told you to clean connectors on RAM sticks, not on the slot end. <comment37843> Oh, that's not clear, you might want to refer to them as the prongs on the RAM. "Connectors" sounds like the receiving end of it. But, word, I'll give that a try and also compressed air. Is there *any* way to diagnose if the bay is going bad? <comment37844> @xanadont If there is a way to diagnose that I believe it involves some special equipment.
