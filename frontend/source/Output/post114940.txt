How do you edit Internet Accounts in shell? <body> I created two IMAP accounts in Mail app.  However I had to enter two wrong email address/passwords to be able to manually set my hotmail as IMAP.  e.g. one is sdsd@erer.com  When I view them in accounts it shows it as sdsd@erer.com I have already edited Accounts.plist and corrected but that doesn't seem to be the right place.  Where do I go?  <answer114941> I found what I needed in ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.mcc.accounts  It's an XML file and it has 4 occurences of each wrong email. Updated and it works fine in Mail.app
