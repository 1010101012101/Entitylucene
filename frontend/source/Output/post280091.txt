macos sierra install from usb error <body> Today was apple doomsday for me.   I have a mid 2015 Macbook Pro that just stopped booting out of the sudden. Thinking, I'll fix it, I formatted (erased) my hard drive (ssd) and first tried Internet Recovery, which didn't work. Then, using another macbook I made a bootable USB, which works great until I actually try to install sierra. It hangs for like 5 minutes then it shows an error:  precodeFailed to retrieve file:///Volumes/Image%20Volume/Install%20macos%20Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg (Error Domain=com.apple.PackageKit.PKFileDownload Code=3) /code/pre  Any thoughts?   <answer285336> Nevermind, took it to an Apple Store and apparently the issue was that the SSD was broken. Got it replaced.
