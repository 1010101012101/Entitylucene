Apple Numbers using AND in formula to find dupes <body> I don't get it how to use multiple conditions in the following case...  precodeIF(COUNTIF(name,name)&gt;1 AND(ISBLANK(meaning)),"x", "") /code/pre  What this should do is compare the cells in column A (name) for duplicates and also check if column G (meaning) is blank. But it tells me syntax error. Where and how do I use the AND?  <answer194803> Figured it out! AND cannot be used since it's a function itself, instead IF needs to be nested, like this...  precodeIF(COUNTIF(name,name)&gt;1,IF(ISBLANK(meaning),"X",""),"") /code/pre  <comment237096> Glad you found a solution!
