My DIY Fusion Drive works as slowly as a hard disc. How do I fix it? <body> My iMac's Fusion Drive became unfused, so I recreated it using these steps. However, the Fusion Drive is as slow as a hard disc, or worse. Terminal just took 13 seconds to open. Sequential write speed is no more than 110 MB/s, and read, 150 MB/s:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5SNMT.png" alt="enter image description here" This is using using xbench.  Notice that the hard disc is index 0 and the SSD has index 1.

That is, if Fusion Drive treats index 0 as the fast storage, it's caching the SSD onto the HDD.  Alternatively, is it because Fusion Drive merely didn't get a chance to move data between the two disks after it was created? It has been two weeks, and I rebooted a couple of times. Is that not enough for it to work?  How do I verify the placement of data between the two drives? Of the 1.3 TB in the Macintosh HD volume, how much is stored on the SSD and how much on the HDD?  How can I swap the indices of the SSD and HDD within the Core Storage volume without data loss (having to reinstall macOS)?
