Can I force a cache refresh in Safari running on iOS? <body> Most Windows desktop browsers utilize the keyboard combination kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdF5/kbd to force a page specific cache refresh. Mac OS X based browsers tend to use kbdCommand/kbd + kbdR/kbd. Is there an equivalent cache refresh for a single page in Safari running on iOS?  subI realize I can manually clear the browser cache, but I'd prefer to only refresh for the page I am currently viewing./sub  <answer74812> If you force quit Safari (click the home button, then double-click the home button, press and hold the Safari icon in the multitasking bar, then tap the red dot), it appears that Safari will clear its cache.  But this will clear the entire cache, not just a single page.  You can also clear Safari cookies and data in the Settings app.  Under Advanced you can clear data from individual websites, which may work if you know all the sites associated with the web page you want to flush.  <answer138844> you can add random number get to the script or link src like :   code&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css?rand=&lt;?=$rand;?&gt;" type="text/css" /&gt;  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.js?rand=&lt;?=$rand;?&gt;"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;/code  this forces Safari to reload the file, cause it thinks it is a different file.  <answer168497> Double-tap the refresh button.  <answer195353> Force quit did not work reliably for me in iOS 8. What did is using private mode for testing:  ol liOpen the page in private mode (and bookmark it so you can open it later)./li liWhen you need to refresh, close browser "tab" (you can stay in Safari and private mode)./li liOpen the page again (use the bookmark you created in step 1)./li /ol  <answer259865> Long press refresh button. iPhone 6  <comment86907> Is this what you are thinking of? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/73153/how-to-clear-browser-cache-for-just-one-specific-site-in-mobile-safari <comment86911> @bassplayer7 it is close but not quite the same. Command + R only refreshes the resources for the specific page you are dealing with. Meaning that externally linked JavaScript from a CDN would also be refreshed. This excludes resources which are not referenced. It's a very fine grained control afforded to desktop browsers and is ***super*** handy for web development. <comment86912> Makes sense. As a web developer, I understand your point ofhow convenient it is. I'm assuming that you already do, but I can't help not mention it - I use [this app from Adobe](http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/) for my mobile work. And, I believe restarting the Safari - cumbersome as it is - is at least more of a refresh then the button. I haven't messed with it enough to know exactly what it is refreshing, though. <comment86923> Does pushing the refresh button in the address bar not refresh cached content as well? <comment141415> This is not working for me (iOs 7.0.4). <comment141416> With iOS 7, you toss the app upwards from the recent/multitasking list to force-quit it. <comment159599> iOS 7.1 here, I checked via Safari's remote developer tools and it seems that the resources are indeed not cached after force-quitting the app (Timelines  Network requests) <comment163783> How does this work from the user side? <comment233937> Not a great solution, but it seems to be the best that iOS gives us to work with. <comment233938> Does this work for anyone? Double-tap just stops the refresh that I started with the first tap. <comment286943> Yes this was the only thing that actually worked for me.  Not sure if this just kicks safari in the ass but it works. <comment359120> That brings up a menu with "request desktop site" in Phone 7. <comment364165> Append a random parameter to the URL at the top `...?rand=15`
