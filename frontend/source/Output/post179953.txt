launchd using 100% CPU for 20 seconds once per minute <body> I'm trying to track down a problem with launchd on OS X 10.9.5.  Once every minute, launchd spikes to 100% cpu for about 20 second or so, then goes back to minimal cpu usage. So thats ~20 seconds at 100%, ~40 seconds at 0%.  I've tried to look into what is going on by seeing what it's running during those spikes. Comparing the output from codelaunchctl list/code during the high cpu and during the quite (using codediff/code) time yields something like  precode&lt; 37315 -   0x7fa38d403a00.anonymous.launchctl --- &gt; 37316 -   0x7fa391801ad0.anonymous.launchctl /code/pre  which seems ok.  Nothing is showing up for launchd in the system log (I've tried increasing the log level to codelaunchctl log level debug/code but apparently that doesn't do anything), and looking in the /System/Library/Launch* and ~/Library/Launch* directories for anything with a 60-second interval is coming up with only system agents/daemons.  Anybody have ideas on how to track down what is going on? Having one of my CPUs spending a third of its life at full tilt is not something I want to have to live with. It also seems interferes with certain tasks, for instance starting a new shell session (through Terminal or sshing into the machine) will hang until launchd is done doing whatever it's so busy doing.  Thanks!  (Small update on logs: It seems you need to use codesudo/code to have changes to codelaunchctl/code's log level take effect. Setting the log level to "info" yields nothing new, but setting it to "debug" gives me the following three messages repeated emmany thousands of times per second/em in my console:  precode4/8/15 7:57:59.037 AM com.apple.launchd[1]: MIG request. 4/8/15 7:57:59.037 AM com.apple.launchd[1]: MIG callout: 421 4/8/15 7:57:59.037 AM com.apple.launchd[1]: MIG demux succeeded. /code/pre  I don't know if those messages are related, but they make the log file all but useless for debugging.)
