2007 Macbook shows black screen and cursor when woken from sleep. What should I do? <body> When I open the lid from my MacBook, occasionally (not always) it will just show a black screen and a cursor, and the hard drive is spinning, but the log on dialog will never show up.  Sometimes it shows up after a minute or two, sometimes it doesn't, so I close the lid - wait five seconds - and try again.  Does this sound like an issue anyone has heard of before?  <answer626> Yeah, I've had this issue very occasionally on my MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, I've never found a reliable solution to it. Normally I simply killed the machine and rebooted. I've always suspects it's simply an issue of the hardware/software not syncing up quite right on wake, which is something that can and does frequently happen on all manner of Mac and PC hardware.  <answer629> I've had this happen too.  Solutions that occasionally work:  ul liClose the lid, wait for the 'sleeping' light pulses from the front of the laptop, then reopen and try again./li liType my password (I have password protected sleep/screensaver) and hit enter blind./li liWait a few minutes/li liSleep the computer by hitting the power button once (not holding it down), then waking it up./li liSwearing profusely/li /ul  Solutions that almost always work:  ul liForce rebooting./li /ul  <answer633> This often happened with my 2006 Macbook running OSX 10.4 (Tiger), but then went away entirely once I upgraded OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard).  <answer696> I have a MacBook with Snow Leopard and sometimes this is happening to me too.br Usually I just close the lid again, wait a minute or such for the light to begin to pulse, open the lid again and then everything works normally.  <comment563> Ditto, unfortunately. <comment595> +1 Me too! Especially the swearing. And it rarely works (I suspect the Mac's audio-in is still asleep at this point). Briefly blipping the power button works fairly often, though.
