If I upgrade my OS will CS4 still work? <body> I have Adobe Creative Suite 4 running on OS 10.5.8.  If I upgrade to 10.6.6 will CS4 programs still work?  <answer40272> Photoshop CS4 is running fine for me under OS X 10.6.8.    NOTE, for switching the OS it is safest to go into the Help menu to deactivate Photoshop, then activate again the first time you use it after switching.  <answer40273> Yes, I have it running on Lion ( 10.7.2 )  <comment45538> Safest, meaning what? Does this have to do with the software licensing? (I don't have CS4; just curious what this really means.) <comment45549> You are allowed two (I think) copies installed at a time.  Uninstall one to install another.  But under some circumstances (I don't know the details) the new OS may be seen as a new installation.
