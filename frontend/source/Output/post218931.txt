Mac Mini - Mac OSX 10.9.5 no longer recognizes Seagate Backup Plus Portable Drive <body> I recently updated the software on my Mac Mini Mac OSX to 10.9.5 and since then it no longer recognizes my Seagate Backup Plus Drive. The drive is running ( I can hear it ) but the error message says codeSeagate Backup Plus Drive is not available/code.   <comment264786> To which version of Mac OS X did you update the Mac Mini? Also, what model of Mac Mini are you using? What other software was updated? This [Seagate support page](http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/007616en?language=en_US) lists compatibility with this drive and Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11). Perhaps you will need to update the Seagate software, too.  Good luck! <comment265054> It is still OSX 10.9.5. The update was a software update to that system. <comment265056> It is a Mac Mini (Mid 2011) with a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and the software is OSX 10.9.5 (13F1507) <comment265059> As I indicated in my first comment, try updating the Seagate software to the version they recommend. I edited your post to make things a bit clearer. <comment265938> I went to the Seagate Technology download finder and entered the serial number of my Seagate Backup Plus Portable Drive.The response I got was that "No newer firmware is available'.
