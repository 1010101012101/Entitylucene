iPhone 4S cannot send messages <body> I recently unlocked my iPhone 4S from AU KDDI to one of the carriers here in my country. I can make calls, receive messages but i cannot send messages. I checked the registered number under "Messages- Send&amp;Receive" and i have my old japanese number still being displayed, and greyed out( meaning i cannot change it). I changed my personal details in my Apple store account but the number has not changed still. Please help me find a solution how i can change this number to display my current number.  <answer103859> Go to codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Phone/code (or Settings  Phonecode, depending on iOS version), and see what it says under/codeMy number`. Chances are it still has your old number, if it does, change it to your new one.  Does your old Japanese number have a check mark next to it or is it just greyed out in Messages and FaceTime?  What does it say when you try and send a SMS? What error message are you getting?  Is this only for iMessage or ALL SMS?  Is your Data working?
