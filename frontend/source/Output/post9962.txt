What will happen if I restore my iPhone from itunes? <body> So, What will happen if I restore my iPhone from itunes?  <answer9963> Your iPhone will return to factory settings as if you had a new iPhone.  <comment10415> And all your stuff will be synched back from the back up in iTunes. IF you had synced this particular phone before. Isn't that correct? <comment10421> @Per Wikilander: Yes, if you "restore from backup" you may be able to put the info back on your iPhone that was on there last time your iPhone was synced properly.
