Two Calendar alerts not working since iOS 9 update <body> Since the iOS 9.0.x update, I can't set two different alerts on calendar entries.   Whatever I put in for the first or second alert overwrites both time periods.   Is there a fix or workaround for this?  <answer212050> I was able to duplicate this issue on iOS 9.0.2, and these steps worked for me:  ol liTap "Second Alert"/li liSet it to "None" (at the top)/li liTap "Second Alert" again/li liSet it to the desired time./li /ol  <answer212054> This appears to be fixed on iOS 9.1 for me. Do a backup just in case your upgrade goes south, but my upgrades were all 15 minutes of waiting during reboots once the download was done.  <comment256043> Great workaround for people that aren't ready to jump to iOS 9.1 yet. <comment266777> This doesn't work for me... First alert: 1 day, then set second alert to none, then save, then set second alert to 1 hour, and the first alert is replaced with the second alert, and the second alert is now 1 day. Obviously, the second alert should always be closer to the event than the first alert. <comment266788> @Redtopia Updating iOS should fix this problem. <comment266789> I'm all updated, but it may just be confusing because the second alert might be the first one to go off. I read somewhere that the first alert is the closest one to the event. <comment266876> oh, it's just switching them? that's not a bug. This question is asking about a bug when they both become one day.
