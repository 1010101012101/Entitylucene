Is it possible to use a third-party unauthorized charger with an iPad running iOS 7 <body> Is it possible to use a third-party unauthorized charger with an iPad running iOS 7? I have an iPad 2 with a 30 pin connector.  <answer102432> As long as the charger supplies the correct wattage, the version of iOS shouldn't matter.  <comment120602> Do you get the warning ? <comment120627> This is not always true. Software changes can change how fussy the device is about getting precisely the right wattage. Apple also performs other checks sometimes.
