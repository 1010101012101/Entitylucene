Will the new iPad (bought in Korea) work in the USA? <body> I want to buy the new iPad (iPad 3) in Korea with both the WiFi- and cellular service, but I was wondering if this configuration will work on the Verizon Network in the US?  According to Korea's Apple Website the WiFi + cellular specs are:  ul liWi-Fi(802.11a/b/g/n)/li liBluetooth 4.0 기술/li liUMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)/li li4G LTE (700, 2100 MHz)/li /ul  Also, I was wondering if it would be unlocked?   <answer63987> Yep, it will work in the USA. There is no difference in the hardware for a cellular iPad bought in USA or in any other country.   All iPads have been sold unlocked since their release. So yes, it will be unlocked.

In countries without compatible 4G LTE networks, the new iPad will operate on GSM network technologies such as HSPA+ and DC-HSDPA.    When you travel internationally, you can use a micro-SIM card from a local carrier."    <comment74060> Great content to your answer, but is there any way you could add some sources so we know how you know this?
