An error occurred when configuring keychain syncing <body> I'm using MobileMe to sync my keychain between an iMac and a MacBook Air. Since both machines run Lion this error message pops up every other system start (or when waking up from sleep): "An error occurred when configuring keychain syncing." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3RcZN.png" alt="Screenshot"  I have already reset the keychain on MobileMe and on both machines but the error message keeps coming. Is there anything else I can do?  <answer24101> No solution yet, looks like an OSX Lion issue...
