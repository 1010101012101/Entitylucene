How to send letters to all the recipients at once Apple Mail? <body> I have 100 open emails in Apple Mail. There will be one recipient for each email. Such a requirement is very important to me and can't be changed.  How can I automate the process of sending these emails with one or two clicks? I prefer not having to press 'Send' 100 times.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5dQIY.png" alt=""  <answer284072> The send shortcut is ⇧⌘D. Hold this down to send the emails.
