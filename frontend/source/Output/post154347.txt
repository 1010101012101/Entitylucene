My MacBook Pro - snow leopard - won't connect to my network or open internet based apps <body> Randomly, my Mac stopped connecting to my wifi network 2 days ago and now it will also no longer open safari or other internet based apps.  If I plug in an Ethernet cable, I still can't gain internet access - however I am writing to you now off my iPhone connected to my fast wifi - still working well!   My network icon is always 'searching'. I can find my network occasionally and the status will be connected, but the icon remains searching and no internet is let through on to my mac.   I've tried the usual diagnostics but it replies my password or network name is wrong although it is correct. When I look in 'airport', nothing is found. No addresses are in my TCP/IP information, nothing in my DNS tab, no proxies boxes selected.   I have powered down my mac and routed numerous times and turned wifi on and off no end. All other apple hardware connects well.
