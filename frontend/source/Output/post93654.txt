Clean install Mac OS X 10.6.8, using USB Drive <body> I've Mac 10.5.8. I've upgraded to Mac 10.6.8, using USB device. Now I'm thinking of clean installing Mac 10.6.8, using USB device. When inserting Mac 10.5.8 CD, I' getting option to format the disk. But when using Mac 10.6.8 USB device, I'm not able to format the disk.  Any suggestion...?  <comment109863> if you are fairly technical and have backed up all the data you could clean up your hard disk using a mini linux installer from a CD- remove mac, and then re install. But I'm no apple expert, please find out about this from someone else on here first
