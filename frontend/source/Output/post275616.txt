How to distribute beta apps without UDID in iOS <body> I was using TestFligh to distrubute beta releases. it works nicely. but it takes much time to archive and upload to App Store. (cannot send any beta releases as quick as possible). so only for testing purposes we moved to codeFabric.io/code which provides us codecrashlytics/code as well as, support for beta release. but it required Device codeUDID/code. That means we have to add device codeUDID/code when new user came for testing. currently we are using strongapple team account/strong. can we overcome this problem if we buy an strongapple enterprise account/strong. what we actually need is allow those users/tester to send the beta release invitation with only the emiail and withoud adding their codeUDID/code's.      can we overcome this problem if we buy an strongapple enterprise account/strong   or is there any other alternative way to do this.hope your help with this.   <comment346731> You should [contact Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/contact/) directly.
