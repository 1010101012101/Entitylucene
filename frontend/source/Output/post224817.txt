Apple Photos: Add a face when there's no button in the info window <body> The normal way to add a face in Photos is to open the phone, open the info window, and the click the code+/code button that should appear in that window's faces section.  However, on some photos, the button just doesn't appear.  This seems to be the case on burst photos. For these, when Photos automatically recognizes the face, all works well, but when they miss one and you have to add it manually, the button doesn't appear so there doesn't seem to be a way to do it.  Is there a workaround for these cases when the button doesn't appear?
