cloudd and sharing <body> I found an old "answer" to this question, but the OS has changed since that anwer was posted and won't work now.  So, here's the problem.   I changed the Login password of my 2013 MB Pro running Sierra so that it is now the same as my Apple ID password.  However, when I restart, I am badgered by a request to input my password for something called sharingd and cloudd.  Neither will accept the NEW MB Pro login password, only the OLD one.  As a check, when I attempt to reveal any of the hidden pwds in Keychain I need to input the NEW MB Pro password, and not the old one required by sharingd and cloudd.   Many thanks.   <comment349871> What happens when you log out of and then back into iCloud (under system preferences)? <comment349900> When I go to Sys Prefs  iCloud, Noah, and move to log out, I get the notice that if I sign out of iCloud, I will need to create a separate password for this Mac.  That's vague, and I am reluctant to proceed.  Do you know what they mean?  A separate password for what? For iCloud?  I will then have another password in order to log into icloud.com?   Am I in danger of making even a bigger mess by loggin and having yet another password to keep track of?  Thanks for responding.
