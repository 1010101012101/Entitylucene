Sourcing and opening multiple files of same name, in specified folder, in Terminal? Is there a way? <body> Say I open terminal and change directory to folder 'folder', I type  precodecd folder.  /code/pre  Say there're multiple folders within this folder, i.e. data 1, data 2, data 3, etc., and within each of those is an image named 'image_a'. Is there a way to source all of the 'image_a' files, and open them via command line? Or write a script/run a function that does?  This part may be irrelevant, but they're NIfTI gzip (.nii.gz) files that I'll open via FSLview. The syntax to open a single image is  precodefslview &lt;/file&gt; /code/pre  <answer273713> Try each of these  precodefslview image_a*  open image_a* /code/pre  <answer273714> It depends on whether codefslview/code accepts several filenames at once and does the right thing based on that (the documentation/man page should have more details on this). If yes, you can run  precodecd folder fslview data*/image_a /code/pre  to have it open all files at once. If no, you can use  precodecd folder for f in data*; do fslview "$f"/image_a; done /code/pre  or  precodecd folder for f in data*/image_a; do fslview "$f"; done /code/pre  instead (the second option works better if there are codedata X/code directories which don't contain codeimage_a/code).  PS: For a test run, replace codefslview/code with codeecho fslview/code to see which command(s) would be executed.
