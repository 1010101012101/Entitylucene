How to merge 2 iTunes libraries of 2 different devices without messing with data on devices? <body> I have an old laptop, and I always synced my iPod to it. After getting an iPhone I started syncing it with another iTunes library on my current laptop. Now I want to clear my old laptop by moving its app backups, books and music data off to the main laptop.   I know that iTunes remembers the synced state of each device, the checked and unchecked music/books, installed and not installed apps, etc. I also heard that when you'll try to sync your device to another iTunes (which doesn't have the synced data) it'll offer to erase your current data on the device or something like that.  I know I probably could just merge my iTunes Media folder from old pc to a new one, but that's just files and folders. But where does it keep info about what to sync to your specific device anAd what not? I am afraid that without that info it'll just erase my iPod contents and would try to sync my whole merged library to it. Is there some database or some ways to export without overwriting current iPhone sync data on the target iTunes?  Both laptops in question have windows 10 installed.
