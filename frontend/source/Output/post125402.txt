Icons remains the same after I have changed the default program for opening the file <body> I have just uninstalled a program from my new mac. The program was making itself default to open all code.r/code files. I installed a new program, and I maked it default for opening code.r/code files, but the old icon of the files remains. The icon of the old program is stil at every code.r/code-files.  How can I update the icons of the code.r/code-files, so they view the icons of the new program? And why do this icon still exist at my mac, can I remove the icon of the old program?  <answer126526> You can try to rebuild LaunchServices database from Terminal:     /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister   -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user   Path to codelsregister/code on Mavericks is:     /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister   <answer197810> For Yosemite 10.10.4 use:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  <answer260487> strongOn macOS Sierra 10.12.1/strong the codelsregister/code solution provided by @Mateusz Szlosek hasn't worked.  strongBut this solution worked/strong: Reset icon cache on MacBook  Nevertheless, changing the default application for a file type via Finder's "Open with…" causes no immediate refresh of icons on the Desktop and in the Finder windows. This is a bug.  hr  strongSome criticism at the end/strong: As a long time Apple user I always preferred the instant feedback and GUI refresh of macOS as opposed to Windows, where you had and still have to do a lot of manual refreshing &amp; more burdens/precaution for the user due to a lack of cross process sync/awareness (i.e. renaming a file in Explorer while it is open in another app, will cause you problems, still in 2016).  Instant cross process interaction of all stock apps and all apps using standard frameworks is what's so fine on the Mac, i.e. Re-enabling a network interface and Safari automatically loads the content of an idle browser tab, Renaming a file in Finder while it was opened hassle free, Changing an icon and its updated in every view instance (Finder, file dialog of apps, icon in app's title bar), etc.  Hate to see these qualities vanishing. Apple clearly neglects its professional Mac users over its iOS users and their Cloud services. With iCloud Apple perfects cross device sync but does not deliver the perfect synchronism within the Mac as it once did.  <answer286207> the above solution didn't worked for me ... so this is what I have tried and it worked ... I am explaining this here because if the above solution is not working for someone then he/she can just reboot their mac in Safe Mode login and then shutdown and boot in to normal mode ... Problem solved :)    <comment148547> That doesn't work on mavericks' <comment148565> @UpAndAdam I edited my answer. <comment148631> Thanks for the update! Will try tonight and upvote accordingly! <comment238463> Not working for me. <comment238845> Not working for me as well on OS X 10.10.4 <comment261783> This command did nothing until I restarted the machine. After restart, it got rid of the previous association but didn't link the new one. Odd. <comment326115> `lsregister` on macOS 10.12 Sierra exists at the filepath as stated by @florin, and it executes without any error message, but it has no effect. Also restarting the Finder and the whole system brought no effect. I had changed the association of .TXT (plain text) from TextEdit to TextWrangler and back again to TextEdit, but it still shows the TextWrangler icons for the text files. <comment326156> Maybe `sudo lsregister …` would work. Suspect that because the command line contains the argument `-domain system`, which I assume needs admin rights. Though I did not get any error message hinting that way but maybe this `lsregister` is implemented so minimally without any feedback because as a framework helper it's probably not intended for being run non-programmatically. I assume the user caches of LaunchServices were properly cleared, but not the system caches. Nevertheless found a working solution for macOS Sierra 10.12.1, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/260487/11510
