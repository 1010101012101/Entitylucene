Aperture keeps asking about locked keyword file <body> Because I keep creating keywords not in my hierarchy I've taken to keeping the keyword file locked.    I keep getting asked about a keyword that I stopped using earlier this evening, consolidating it into another word.   I get a dialog box   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O5ooQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I click "Do not add Keyword" and it goes away -- for a few minutes until I add a few more keywords.  This keyword, "Autumn -- Fall" was recently consolidated into "Autumn"  This problem has now survived a quit and restart.  It's as if keywords were queued somewhere, but checked against the keyword file only on being written out.  How do I get this to stop nagging me?
