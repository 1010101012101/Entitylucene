(if iCloud is crashing - set up gmail first, etc.) It's less likely the crash is app related and it might be more due to the settings files being corrupt or the actual mail data that is drawn on screen being corrupt.  <comment319981> see if http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/174732/85275 helps <comment320798> Thanks for your comment, I tried everything but I finally ended up installing thunderbird.
