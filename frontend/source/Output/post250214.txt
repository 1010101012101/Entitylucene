Erase and restore of the iPhone from iTunes is possible without this (potentially dangerous) step. Also, erasing it via Find My iPhone will do just that (erase), it will not update the OS or do anything else. So you still need to set it up again (via iTunes or iCloud, whereever your backup is stored) afterwards. <comment310623> @alex Not necessarily, the SIM passcode is different from the iPhone password.
