How do I do a diagonal-arrow keyboard shortcut? <body> Occasionally, you see a keyboard shortcut for something in an app's menus that shows a diagonal-pointing arrow (one that points 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees) rather than your standard up, right, down, or left arrow keys. Here's a screenshot of what I'm talking about:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mwpvZ.png" alt="Screenshot showing a sample diagonal arrow"  How do I accomplish that key chord?  <answer122516> I suggest you to open your keyboard visualizer (by clicking on the flag that is near the clock in the menu bar).  This will make appear a window with a keyboard representation.  If you press the kbdfn/kbd key, you'll see that the kbd←/kbd will become a kbd↖︎/kbd (Home key) in this window while kbd→/kbd will become kbd↘︎/kbd (End key).  That's it: just press the kbdfn/kbd+kbd←/kbd or kbdfn/kbd+kbd→/kbd to obtain the diagonal-arrow.   <answer122531> These are the home and end keys on OS X.  ul liOn full keyboards, there are keys designated to home and end./li liOn notebooks you can press home by pressing fn+left and end by pressing fn+right.     h3Additional key behaviors/h3      ul   liThe Numlock key has been removed on Late 2007 and later Mac notebooks./li   liHome key functionality is performed by pressing Fn (Function) and Left Arrow key./li   liEnd key functionality is performed by pressing Fn and Right Arrow key./li   liPage Up key functionality is performed by pressing Fn and Up Arrow key./li   liPage Down key functionality is performed by pressing Fn and Down Arrow key./li   /ul         supSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3164/sup/li /ul  <answer159577> Following up on @lauhub's answer, you enable the system's Keyboard Viewer in the Keyboard system preferences. In the "Input Sources" tab, check "Show input menu in menu bar." (In older versions of OSX, this is International system preferences' "Input Menu" tab.) The newly-enabled menubar menu includes "Show Keyboard Viewer."  <comment142963> While I haven't used the keyboard visualizer, pressing `fn`+`←` does accomplish the command. Thanks.
