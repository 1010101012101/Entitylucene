Set a default Wifi network <body> I am new on Apple world. I have a MacBook Pro mid 2014. I have an issue and don't know how to solve it.  When I am at home and turn my Mac on, it tries to connect on the first free wifi network which is a low signal one. I want to force it and connect on my home network instead. Now, I do it manually by disconnecting and connecting to the right one.  Is there any solution?  <answer202117> Open up codeSystem Preferences/code. Click codeNetwork/code. After you select codeWi-Fi/code on the left, click codeAdvanced.../code . Drag your home network to the top under codePreferred Networks/code. Click codeOK/code then codeApply/code.  <comment243769> possible duplicate of [How to change network connection order?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45702/how-to-change-network-connection-order) <comment243777> Could you upload a screen shot of how you connect? Is home network an WiFi network or ethernet or something else? <comment243780> It proved that the answer was the right one. Didn't know that there is a preferred list and it was lower that the free one.
