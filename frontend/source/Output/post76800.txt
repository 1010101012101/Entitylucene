Facebook Messenger login data <body> If I uninstall Facebook Messenger from my iPhone and then re-install it from the App Store, it remembers my login. "Login as [Name]? Not you?"  strongWhere does it store this? How can I disable that?/strong I thought deleting the app also deleted the data, including username and password!  I checked iCloud app data, and there is nothing there labeled Facebook.  emNote: that I'm not talking about the full Facebook app, only the official Messenger app, also made by Facebook Inc./em  I do not use the builtin iOS 6 Facebook login, so that shouldn't be the issue.  <comment89100> Doesn't it use the login given with the FB API ? <comment89200> @MatthieuRiegler - I don't use the builtin Facebook capabilities, added that to my question. <comment96484> Did you check whether your login is still displayed/stored in Settings? <comment96662> @patrix ~ Where? I checked `Settings  General  Usage  Manage Storage` for iCloud data. There was nothing. <comment96663> Main screen of Settings, scroll down, should be between iTunes U and aettings for user-installed apps <comment96750> @patrix ~ I said I don't use the built in Facebook, so no. <comment370697> Where is your keychain stored?
