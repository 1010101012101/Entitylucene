Remove folders in ~/Library/Mobile Documents <body> There are some folders in code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code (like codeXXXXXX~com~companyname~appname/code) which seems to be left by apps I already removed from all my devices. However, if I delete those folders, they restored back almost immediately. They are not visible in Finder or in iCloud management in System Preferences. How to get rid of them?  <answer281350> You cannot do that, this is how iCloud works.   These folders are how iCloud is designed to work, so you can stop using iCloud or forget about your intentions for a 'clean system'; sorry for saying this but you are not using a Linux flavor.   So, iCloud is not designed to allow you to micromanage it. The folders will be empty if you have no data in that application.   <comment326005> When I deleted some of mine, the iCloud Drive folder under Finder Favorites also seemed to be stuck forever syncing, through multiple reboots, until I reinstalled those apps and let them fix those folders. I would definitely like to know how to get rid of them. <comment343789> Have you tried signing into icloud.com, clicking the iCloud Drive button, and deleting them from the web interface? <comment345853> @py4on iCloud Drive for web doesn't show those folders. Actually it shows only `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/` and some folders from apps I using, like Automator, Pixelmator, Pages, etc... But there is a bunch of folders created by apps I already removed, and those folders are invisible everywhere except of Terminal `ls -a` command.
