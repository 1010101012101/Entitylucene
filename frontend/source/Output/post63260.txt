How to enable TCP/IP for Postgres on OS X 10.7 Server? <body> The default configuration in code/var/pgsql/postgresql.conf/code says that codelisten_addresses/code defaults to codelocalhost/code, but it doesn't let me connect over port 5432.  Connecting (as root, using sudo) over a Unix domain socket works fine, but I need to enable network connections.  I tried uncommenting the codelisten_addresses = 'localhost'/code line (to make it explicit), and restarting the Postgres process (with codesudo serveradmin stop postgres/code, codesudo serveradmin start postgres/code), but that didn't help.  <answer63263> The Postgres process started by "serveradmin" has command-line arguments added by code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postgresql.postgres.plist/code.  The default includes code-c listen_addresses=/code, which turns off TCP/IP.  Changing it to codelisten_addresses=localhost/code, and restarting Postgres, solved the problem.  (I suppose I could probably also remove the code-c/code argument entirely.)  (One comment I found somewhere suggested that in 10.8 Server, the file you need to edit is code/Library/Server/PostgreSQL/Config/org.postgresql.postgres.plist/code, but I haven't upgraded to 10.8 yet so I can't confirm this.)
