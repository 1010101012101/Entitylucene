Using The Terminal Command and Emacs To Play The Video Game "Tetris"? <body> OS X via the Terminal command and Emacs apparently allows you to access and play a version of the video game Tetris.  How do you accomplish this (and can you play via keyboard controls) ?  <answer103602> To start emacs just type emacskbdâ†©/kbdbr This tells the shell to look for an executable file emacs in a directory listed in the PATH environment variable.  When in emacs run the command tetris that is kbdesc/kbdxtetris   The controls are the arrow keys  Note that something seems to be wrong with the score file e.g. it won't save high scores etc.
