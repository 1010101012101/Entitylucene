How can I enable rEFIt boot volume choice after waking up from hibernation mode? <body> There are pretty clear answers to the question 'How to put my Mac into hibernation mode voluntary', but there is still an issue for me.  I use Bootcamp Windows and rEFIt to select which sistem to load. But when I wake from the hibernation mode I have no option to choose - just Mac OS is loading. How can I enable boot source choose after waking up from the hibernation mode?  <answer8818> Here seems to be a good explanation of the process.br Might be a tad old though :)  http://blog.yasmar.net/2006/05/make-refit-and-safe-sleep-play-well-together/  <comment122967> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment123086> You are totally correct and this is a good example of why that is so, as the link is dead and beyond repair.
