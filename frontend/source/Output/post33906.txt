Alternative to Windows Snipping Tool for Mac OSX <body> Is there something like the Windows Snipping Tool for OSX?   For those, who don't know about the tool, it's an easy to use software to take snapshot of any portion of screen, and is really useful in various situations.  <answer33907> There is now a blog entry about strongTaking Screenshots in a Snap/strong.  hr  It's built into Mac OS.  ul likbd⌘/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd3/kbd captures the whole screen/li likbd⌘/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd4/kbd captures a custom rectangle  (click and drag over the screen region you want to capture)/li likbd⌘/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd4/kbd then kbdspace/kbd captures a specific window (move the mouse cursor over the desired window, then click)/li /ul  Press kbdesc/kbd to cancel.  Screenshots are strongsaved onto your Desktop/strong and timestamped.  By default the image format is strongpng/strong. However, you can change the format by typing in the strongTerminal/strong:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture type image_format killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  Where codeimage_format/code is one of codejpg/code, codetiff/code, codepdf/code, codepng/code, codebmp/code or codepict/code (among others). If you omit the second line, you will need to log out and in again for the change to take effect.

It is located at code/Applications/Utilities/Grab.app/code  <answer33921> If you also need editing capabilities (e.g. like Windows Paint or however it's called these days), Skitch is a good add-on (and it's free).  <answer33936> Macworld magazine's senior editor Dan Frakes just posted a very good short video tutorial (with show transcript) about the screenshot features of Mac OS X.  This includes how to use the Grab app from the Utilities folder.   The video is at:  http://www.macworld.com/article/164123/2011/12/mac_os_x_screenshot_secrets.html.br His show description: "Mac OS X makes it easy to take screenshots—images of your screen or objects on it.

You can download it from Mac App Store for free  <answer123572> Keyboard Maestro can drive Preview to behave exactly like snipping tool  F13 (in the same place as PrintScreen on Windows)  Open Preview.app  Select menu File/Take Screen Shot/From Selection  <answer141100> Of course, the most convenient way to snapshot on Mac is by pressing keyboard shortcuts, however, this traditional method lacks additional features like making annotations, uploading images online for sharing, etc. For this purposes, you can make use of professional Mac screenshot tools that features the same function as Snipping Tool.  strongGrab/strong - A built-in screenshot tool on Mac that enables you to capture anything you see on screen.  strongSkitch/strong - Easy tool that allows for capturing, annotating and sharing screenshots / images.  strongJing/strong - An effective screen capturing program that works for recording screen and taking screenshot.  <comment38736> awesome! the only problem being as a beginner Mac user I'm already overwhelmed with so many shortcuts!!! One more to remember! :D and I guess after the clicking and dragging the region is in memory so where do I paste it now? need to install an image editing program? <comment38737> The screen shot should produce an image file (a .png?) on your Desktop. The built-in application Preview should allow you to open it. <comment38744> @DavidRouse is right. I'll edit my answer. <comment38745> Note the heavy use of "built in" :) <comment38773> Thanks guys! Yes, the captured image is present on the desktop. :) <comment39119> Holding control in addition to the above shortcuts copies the desired selection to clipboard (like print screen on windows) rather than saving an image file to the desktop <comment39120> can you please avoid using apple.stackexchange.com as a replacement for basic googling? <comment39154> Yes, this can be found in **[``System Preferences-Keyboard-Keyboard Shortcuts-Screen Shots``](http://cl.ly/Clxq/Bildschirmfoto%202011-12-21%20um%2007.41.00.png)** <comment39163> @XAleXOwnZX I understand your concern, but I wouldn't expect to find the topvoted answer below, on Google. Moreover, I'm sure others also found it helpful. <comment39256> First hit for "screenshot mac os x" on google is a page with extensive info on the shortcuts and their uses <comment39267> I did Google it, must have used different keywords but all I found was a bunch of third party softwares... <comment39289> Oh well, next person to google this question will find this answer. <comment51553> http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/02/taking-screenshots-is-a-snap/ <comment77580> Snip is great! Thanks for sharing!!! Having a difficult time from a Windows user to a MAC user... <comment144330> thanks for this - if you automate it, it behaves exactly like snipping tool (I put details 4 answers below) <comment186640> The Grab app seems to be forgotten. Search for screen dump apps for OSX and it is almost never mentioned. I see no reason why. <comment227105> +1 for @timothymh 's link, which shows cool actions like **Tools  Adjust Size...** and `^+⌘+A` for adding arrows... <comment289912> @AMomchilov basic googling brought me here though. :) lol <comment316048> Preview's Tools  Annotate menu provides the functionality I was missing from the snipping tool, namely the ability to highlight and otherwise draw on the screenshot.
