How can I remove a ding from the edge of the iPhone 5? <body> I dropped my iPhone 5 and it left a dig on the shiny edge of the phone.  I was wondering what they best way to try to remove the ding would be.  Should I sand paper it with fine grain?  But I'm afraid it'll scratch it up more.  I could sand it with fine sandpaper, and then use a black sharpie to cover it up.  (I have a black iPhone 5.)  <answer71155> You will make it worse, especially if its the black model. Just live with it.
