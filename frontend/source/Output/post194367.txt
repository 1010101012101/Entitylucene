Does the Apple Watch have more processing power than a Cray 2 Supercomputer? <body> I remember growing up in the 80's and my parents would be astounded that the Commodores and Apple II's of the time would be as powerful as a computer that used to take up a room. (I didn't quite get it at the time). At that time the most powerful computer was a Cray.   Now the tables have turned. Moore's Law continues to march and now I'm the one who is astounded.   strongAssumptions:/strong  ul liIn terms of metrics, I'm interested in instructions/calculations per second. /li /ul  My question is: strongDoes the Apple Watch have more processing power than a Cray 2 Supercomputer?/strong  <answer194374> Thanks to the table on Experts Exchange, it would appear to be safe to say that the Apple Watch strongis/strong more powerful than a Cray-2: Twice as fast, twice the memory.  2 excerpts from that table well worth a look in its entirety:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UqHvt.png" alt="A Cray-2 supercomputer is about as powerful as an Apple iPhone 4"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tqwy4.png" alt="An Apple Watch is about twice the power of an Apple iPhone 4"
