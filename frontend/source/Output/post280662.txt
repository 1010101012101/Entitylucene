Connect to remote Server with macOS Sierra through sftp <body> I recently moved from Ubuntu GNOME (16.04 LTS) to macOS Sierra and I wondered how I could mount a Folder, located on a remote Server, using the sftp protocol. Ubuntu GNOME (16.04) comes with Nautilus as a File Manager by default, so I used that one for the purpose of having a gui for viewing remote folders.  [Setup with Ubuntu GNOME and Nautilus File-manager][3]  My workflow on Ubuntu was to open the Nautilus File manager    ul liClick "Enter Server Adress"/li liSelecting the Connection (for example: sftp://user@example.com)/li liClick "Connect"/li /ul  I like to have a similar or even simpler solution for these steps on Sierra. However, the Server shouldn't always be mounted. I just want a simple way to connect to certain remote Folders with different usernames when I need to, through a save Connection.  Any Ideas how to do this with Finder on macOS Sierra? I am kind a new to the whole Apple ecosystem, I don't even have a an idea where to look for recommended 3rd party software.  <answer280663> ⌘+k will open a "connect to server" dialog when you have finder open. Sounds like what you're looking for.  <answer280664> It seems that this is not possible with MacOS Sierra standard tools (sftp via Finder); Macfusion is also no more compatible with Sierra.  As costly alternative you could use Commander Pro, Panic Transmit 4 or Mountain Duck (35-40$). As less costly alternative you could use Flow from the App Store (~5$). As a free alternative you could use webdav with Finder (http://...).  What I did was installing winebottler (comes packed together with wine in one .dmg) and then install WinSCP via it. It was quick and worked, but is indeed rather a weird solution... ;-)  <answer281724> use sftp username@host in the terminal on Mac and you will be sorted  <answer281883> A colleague suggested me to use filezilla: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx It is not a direct integration into Finder but you have a file browser locally and remotely.  <answer282011> Not possible with macOS out of the box. With Finder you can mount only aftp, cifs, webdav and ftp (but only in read-only). It's ridiculous but it's true because even Windows can connect to FTP with read-write access.  There is a free option with FUSE and sshfs and pricy option with mountainduck  <comment354551> Welcome to Ask Different and thanks for your answer! Can I suggest you provide info such as how you think the answer you provided solves the problem and/or why it may be better than using the Finder (as the OP asked). You also have to be careful about assuming what the OP already knows (e.g. about accessing/using Terminal). See [How to Answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-answer) for tips on providing answers here. <comment354584> This doesn't solve my Problem. sftp with terminal isn't an Issue. I am looking for a integration in the filemanager. The remote Folder should be mounted like an external drive in the finder, so i can browse the remote folder with the finder. <comment354585> Thanks for your suggestion, but ⌘+k doesn't support sftp. is there a way that ⌘+k will accept sftp:// connections? <comment355932> I found it odd getting a -1 for this answer. From my point of view it is a real good alternative as the initial request cannot be achieved (as answered below).
