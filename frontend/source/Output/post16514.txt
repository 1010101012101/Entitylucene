How can I set the Mac OS X screensaver when not logged in? <body> When logged in to my user account, the screensaver selected in System Preferences is used. However, when on the login screen before logging in or using fast user switching a different screensaver is used. How do I set the screensaver used on the login screen?  <answer16515> The screensaver for the login screen is the one set for the root (i.e. system) user account. To launch System Preferences as root, use sudo; a Terminal window run:  precodesudo /Applications/System\ Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/System\ Preferences /code/pre  Then you can change the screensaver settings as you normally would. Note that in order to use sudo, you needs to be an admin user.  <comment88861> The receipe look right, but doesn't work on Lion. The `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist` isn't modified. On the other hand, directly editing this file works fine, but I won't advise anyone to play with `plist + vi` on this file :[.
