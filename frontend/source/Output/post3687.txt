Are there keyboard shortcuts for Home, End, PageDown, and PageUp in OS X? <body> How do I set keyboard shortcuts for kbdHome/kbd, kbdEnd/kbd, kbdPageDown/kbd, and kbdPageUp/kbd on a 13" MacBook Pro? Are there default keyboard shortcuts? Or can I do it with Automator (and if so, how)?  I want them to work the same way that kbdHome/kbd and kbdEnd/kbd do on all Windows apps.   hr  I also want general solution I get that Kyle Cronin♦ was do the same in some apps, but what about others? is there any tricky solution?  <answer3688> You can do page up/down and home/end on a Macbook keyboard by using the kbdfn/kbd and the arrow keys:  kbdfn/kbd+kbd↑/kbd is kbdPageUp/kbdbr/ kbdfn/kbd+kbd↓/kbd is kbdPageDown/kbdbr/ kbdfn/kbd+kbd←/kbd is kbdHome/kbdbr/ kbdfn/kbd+kbd→/kbd is kbdEnd/kbdbr/  <answer3698> For Eclipse it appears that these keys aren't even set to anything by default, at least in my installation.  You probably need to set them in the preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XMuWj.jpg" alt="eclicpse page up and page down"  I don't know exactly where the end and home Windows-like functions are in this screen, I couldn't find anything yet that sounds like what they do.  Something like "move cursor to end\beginning of line" was what I was looking for.  If you're talking about Safari's address bar, try kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2192;/kbd and kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2190;/kbd for end and home.  Those work in lots of other apps as well.  <answer3738> I found another solution for you while I was playing around with KeyRemap4MacBook.  Check out the settings pictured below.  See anything you like? :)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ma1Gq.jpg" alt="keyremap4macbook settings"  <answer3754> kbd⌘/kbd+kbd→/kbd works like a PC's kbdEnd/kbd (moves the cursor to the end of the line). kbd⌘/kbd+kbd←/kbd works like a PC's kbdHome/kbd (moves to the beginning of the line). kbdctrl/kbd+kbdA/kbd and kbdctrl/kbd+kbdE/kbd (Emacs-style keybindings) work in most OS X applications as well.  <answer77688> On my MBP it's: kbdCMD/kbd + kbdFN/kbd + kbd&lt;-/kbd for HOME and kbdCMD/kbd + kbdFN/kbd + kbd-/kbd for END  <answer190089> In Terminal, you can use kbd⌥ Opt/kbd+kbd←/kbd for home and kbd⌥ Opt/kbd+kbd→/kbd for end. Although this is on a Swedish keyboard.  <comment3438> @kyle fn + -  and fn + - not work fine for me. in some apps it's work right but in some apps it works strange. <comment3439> The keystrokes Kyle Cronin provided are correct.  Bear in mind that Home and End do not always behave the same way on OS X as they do on other OSes. <comment3440> +agreed.  There's quite a bit of difference from the windows functionality.  Some apps act like windows with these keys, others don't. <comment3442> @calavera How can I define keystroke for home and end to do exactly the same as windows? <comment3443> @am1rr3za: you can't do it in the OS... it's the way the apps themselves are programmed that defines how they handle those keys.  What specific apps are you having trouble with? <comment3444> @calavera I have problem With Eclipse and also Browser address bar <comment3465> +1 for your answer but I want find general solution. <comment3483> For the browser address bar (and pretty much any text situation), command-left and right replicate Windows' home and end.  As a bonus, option-left and right does the same as Windows' control-left and right. <comment3520> +1 for your answer but I don'thave time now to test it, later I test and tell it solve my problem or not. <comment112969> These are the shortcuts I was hunting for. I wanted to jump to the beginning or end of a document. <comment162882> You also have cmd+up and cmd+down, which do the same thing and require one less finger on the keyboard. <comment163221> This doesn't work on terminal, though <comment163295> @Manu Works for me in terminal. The fn+arrow keys work exactly the same as the dedicated home/end/pgup/pgdn keys on my Apple Keyboard. <comment241404> None of those address PageUp/PageDown on a MacBook
