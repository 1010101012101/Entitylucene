How can I add a website to Notification Center after denying its initial request? <body> For example, when visiting eBay.com or cnn.com, a dialogue box pops up asking if the site can send notifications to Notification Center.    If you initially choose deny, but change your mind later, how can you go about adding a site back to notifications (manually or otherwise)?  <answer169507> You can select the site and revert the changes on Safari → Preferences → Notifications.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/37SQ1.png" alt="enter image description here"
