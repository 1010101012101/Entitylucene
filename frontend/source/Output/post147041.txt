How to have TODO list in the Lock-screen of iPhone? <body> I invented a smart idea! I want to have a todo list as a lock-screen on my iPhone like grocery store listing to my lock-screen. Never forget to buy that dxmn toothpaste again :P   strongHow can I have a grocery store listing or todo listing on my lock-screen on iPhone?/strong  <answer147707> U can use Wunderlist or Clear. If you install one of these apps there will be a widget in the notification center. Just drag down the notification center on your lock screen and you will see your to-do-list from one of these apps..  You can also use Apple's Reminders, these will also display in the notification center..  <comment173330> I found an app [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lock-info-lock-screen-reminders/id683108563?mt=8), I find it very very ODD if Apple Reminders app cannnot be used like this?! Is this incorporated in iOS as a basic feature?! <comment173331> take a screenshot and make it a lock screen <comment173341> @Buscarì›ƒ it is not automatic! Lock Info is automatic and testing...looks awesome, not sure whether any better app than this, researching. <comment173353> oh, I see, it has to be automated :)
