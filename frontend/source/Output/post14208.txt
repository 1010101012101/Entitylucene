webcam not working anymore <body> I was using Skype, and suddenly the internal iSight camera stopped working. It's not the first time this has happened. I already fixed this problem with a reboot, but I would like to find a solution without a reboot. Is there a way to push the driver back, or do some more accurate diagnostic?  I have MacOSX 10.6.7 on a macbook 13" unibody.  <answer14245> Since the error message includes "Canon Digital Camera" I assume that your MBP is connected to an external camera. You can try to eject the device (unplug it from the USB port) and replugin to see whether it helps.  <answer14269> I found out that the camera is taken over, somehow, by the google talk browser plugin. I solved by doing the following. From a terminal, I issued the following command  precodeps uaxw |grep Firefox /code/pre  It will show a list of the processes under Firefox. One of them may be something like  precodesbo      21173   0.0  0.1   414040   2492   ??

I then proceeded to kill this process (the pid is the first number)  precode  kill 21173 /code/pre  and the iSight started working again.  <comment15346> "the camera stopped working". What camera is that? The internal iSight or an external Canon camera? <comment15347> @marconcini: the internal camera. Disregard my bug report. I then realized it was due to my photo camera, and has nothing to do with the internal iSight (Initially I thought it was just because Canon made the iSight, so it registered as such to the USB driver) <comment15348> I am referring to the internal camera.

The internal iSight is not working anymore, and I would like to understand why and how to recover.
