Using two bluetooth headsets for stereo audio in iOS <body> If I buy two of a certain bluetooth 3.0 single-ear headset with a2dp support, and wear one on each ear, is there any way for iOS to give me stereo audio (right channel goes to one headset via a2dp and left channel goes to the other headset via a2dp)?  Note: I'm aware that stereo a2dp headphones are what is normally used for this purpose.
