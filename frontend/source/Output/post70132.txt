Set default shell to MacPorts bash in Mac OS X 10.6.8? <body> As a follow up to my previous question, I reinstalled my MacPorts and want to try its newer version of bash again.  I installed the newest bash via MacPorts on my Mac OS X 10.6.8 system, but when I start a Terminal.app session, the "sh --version" command showed I was still using the old bash 3.2.48. This is even when "which bash" points to the newer 4.2.37 installed by MacPorts.  I tried to change Terminal.app preferences to use the new bash as default, changed /etc/shells, and used the chsh command to specify MacPorts bash as the default. However, none of these methods were successful. What am I missing? Thank you very much.  <answer70189> codesh --version/code is probably the same as code/bin/sh --version/code. If the current shell is bash, you can see its version with codeecho $BASH_VERSION/code. If you change the default login shell with chsh, you can keep Terminal's default shell as the login shell.  ol licodesudo port install bash/code/li liAdd code/opt/local/bin/bash/code to code/etc/shells/code/li licodechsh -s /opt/local/bin/bash/code/li liOpen a new tab and check codeecho $BASH_VERSION/code/li /ol  <comment81441> So you broke the shell once already, and you want to see how to do it again?  The reason `which bash` shows the newer shell but you're running the older one is that the shell is launched by absolute path (/bin/bash) and doesn't obey the path.  Which wouldn't matter anyway, since the path isn't set to include MacPorts until .bashrc is run.
