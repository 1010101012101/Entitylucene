How do I make sure I purchase the correct replacement gfx card for my iMac? <body> I have a 24" Early 2009 iMac, and it has a faulty graphics card (detailed here). I'm obviously no longer under warranty or applecare, and I'd like to try to replace the part myself.  I'm unsure about how to search for and select a replacement part, however, especially since my machine is quite old so the original gfx card model is probably not available new. How can I know that any given card listed on a hardware website will work as a replacement?  (A short list of appropriate gfx card model numbers would also suffice.)  <answer117101> If you are going to replace the part yourself, first you wanna make sure you buy the updated version of your graphics card.

What graphics card do you use? AMD? Intel? NVIDIA?
