samba 4.5 not working on OSX 10.3 <body> Unfortunately I have to use an old OSX10.3 System to access files on a Debian Server, that used Samba 4.2 on Debian Jessie.  Since the update to Debian 9 (stretch) the access is not possible any more: I can select the shares, but cannot connect. Although other Windows Clients can Access like before.  What has changed in the update from Samba 4.2 to 4.5?  ul liLast working version: 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u7/li liNew version: 2:4.5.8+dfsg-2+deb9u1+b1 /li /ul  My Scanner also had no write access at the start, but I found out, on the update the smb configuration was changed in code/etc/samba/smb.conf/code  This config options works for Windows and the Scanner:  precode[privat]     path = /media/privat     valid users = @myself     writable = yes     read list = @myself     write list = @myself     directory mode = 0777     log level = 3 /code/pre  (user codemyself/code must exist in code/etc/groups/code and I added the log level 3 to get more output in code/var/log/samba/log.myIP/code)  In log.smbd I get the error when I try to tconnect to the share from the mac:  precode[2017/08/24 12:38:53.018823,  3] ../source3/lib/util_procid.c:54(pid_to_procid)   pid_to_procid: messaging_dgm_get_unique failed: No such file or directory /code/pre  although i didn't specify any folder yet.  I get the same error when trying to connect on the console with  precodemount_smbfs //username@servername.example.com/share ~/sharename /code/pre  <comment374070> seems like the same problem here: https://access.redhat.com/discussions/2973341
