Does iOS 6 turn-by-turn navigation work with satellite images? <body> Without modifications, can a user turn on satellite images for iOS 6 turn-by-turn navigation use satellite images rather than just a simple interface and monochrome 3D buildingsâ€”although it may be distracting?  <answer64530> No, it doesn't seem to be possible.  If you are in satellite mode, it switches back to "standard" when you start the navigation.  It's a shame, that would be pretty cool.  <comment87959> Thanks. Won't be getting iOS 6 until Christmas, so it's good to know.
