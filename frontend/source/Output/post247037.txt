Cannot execute this binary file <body> appreciate any assistance, I'm a Mac Noob  Im trying to upgrade MySQL in MAMP to 5.6 according to the these instructions  When I try to run the .command script as per #2 I get the following output:  precodeSandies-MacBook:~ sandie$ /Users/sandie/Downloads/Install_MySQL_5.6.25.command ; exit; -bash: /Users/sandie/Downloads/Install_MySQL_5.6.25.command: cannot execute binary file /code/pre  I have found this post, but I still get the "Cannot Execute" error.
