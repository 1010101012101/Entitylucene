How to prevent window resize when exiting Target Display Mode <body> Using a macbook pro, with a thunderbolt cable connecting to an iMac, and using Target Display Mode [TDM] to mirror the display. I choose the optimal resolution for the external display, which means more pixels than I have when using the native display. (This is the point. :)  When the iMac is disconnected (using cmd-F2 to exit TDM), the windows all get resized and moved so they fit in the lower resolution screen. I do not want this behavior. I carry my laptop back and forth to work, and have several Mission Control workspaces that are used for work only. Whenever I come in to work and connect to the big display, I have to resize and move the windows back to where they were.  Is there any way to disable this resizing behavior? TIA
