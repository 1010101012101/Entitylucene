Can't find network files over SMB protocol using the Spotlight in Lion <body> I tried to find some files in a network volume mounted in OS X Lion over SMB using Spotlight. Didn't work.  But, when I tried the same search from OS X Snow Leopard it worked perfectly.  What do I need to perform this kind of search? Something to be enabled with the "defaults" command in the CLI?  <answer52524> You might want to try the free app EasyFind, available from DEVONtechnologies or the App Store.  I tried to insert some screen shots for you but I'm strongtoo much of a newbie/strong. :-)  It works just fine on Lion. We've been using it at our school as a Spotlight replacement for the past few years and it has been fully tested for our Lion rollout this summer.  <answer230842> You have to tell Spotlight to index the volume so you can find the files on it.    Open Terminal and issues the command:  precodesudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/&lt;name of the network_volume you want SL to index&gt; /code/pre  This command should work in every from Snow Lion up to El Capitan
