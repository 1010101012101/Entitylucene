How to test if video is local or streamed from net? <body> If i watch video in QuickTime Player, how i can test in my AppleScript, is this video file in my Mac or is it streamed live from net?  Anybody know address of QuickTime live streams i could use when testing this script?  Thanks  <comment109786> Quicktime can stream from any web URL so perhaps you are interested in a specific video? If you have the file, what is shown in Finder when you get the information for that file and look at More Info section? <comment109803> If you're interested, we could edit out the how to test part since that's already covered on the linked question and assume you have a test script ready. If you wanted to know of examples of live stream sites that use quicktime (either RSTP or HTTP streaming), that might be worth reopening.
