iTunes will not connect with Yamaha AV Reciever icon <body> I have just purchased a new Yamaha AV Receiver RX-V675 which is AirPlay capable.  I have everything installed and configured as per directions in the Yamaha manual and according to Windows &amp; and iTunes directions. The iTunes AirPlay icon shows the receiver (with a speaker icon).  However when I click to initiate the Yamaha it will not execute nor will a check mark show up.   Everything seems set up correctly as far as I know.  I am looking for help and a solution.  I have updated my firmware on the Yamaha and set up with the following equipment configuration:  ul liDell Studio XPS/li liWindows 7/li liYamaha is on a hard wired network connection/li liiTunes 10.2.2.14/li liWindows 7 set up for HomeGroup network and sharing/li liRouter  - Netgear WGR614v9/li /ul  Problem is that the Yamaha AirPlay icon in iTunes will not click on.
