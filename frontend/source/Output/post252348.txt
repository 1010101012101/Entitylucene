Free alternative to Charles <body> Does anybody know a free alternative to Charles (an HTTP debugging proxy), preferably with a GUI and similar features?  Features that I'm interested in:  ul liInspect HTTP requests/responses (header, body, etc)/li liJSON syntax highlighting and formatting/li liRequest filter (by host, URL, etc)/li liSearch/li liWould be awesome if it could render HTML (Charles can't do it)/li /ul  <answer252382> You are the two following Charles like :  ol liFiddler/li /ol  Fiddler for macOS runs on mono, so don't expect the same smooth appearance like you get on Windows.  ol start="2" liWireShark/li /ol  Wireshark is more relevant for capturing everything over the wire (and then filtering by protocols) and not directly useful(easily) for scripting HTTP responses on the fly.   <answer291199> You can also check out mitmproxy which even has a web interface. You can inspect HTTP request/responses and even filter requests by certain parameters.   It doesn't render HTML like you asked but it sure gives out the raw response which might be enough.   Another suggestion I can think of is the developer tools in Firefox which render HTML and also support request filtering. You can obviously inspect HTTP requests in Firefox too.   <comment313960> Please read http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2180/how-should-i-ask-about-getting-a-software-recommendation
