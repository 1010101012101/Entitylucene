Drifting mouse cursor <body> I have a Mac Book Retrina Pro.  My mouse seems to drift to the right of screen all by itself. It doesn't matter if I am using the track pad, a bluetooth mouse or a USB external mouse (or no mouse at all).  It makes it very hard to scroll using the scroll bar arrows, because the mouse drifts while clicking.  How can I fix this?  I have searched on Google, but all the threads are from 2011. The consensus was then it was a software issue, but of course the OS is different now (I am using 10.11.2)  <answer220801> Did you try disabling the Trackpad? One of my colleagues had this exact problem, and found out that it's actually an issue with the trackpad.  <comment267326> How do you disable it? There isn't an option in system preferences. <comment267344> Follow this link : http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/disable-macbook-trackpad/
