deleted private/var folder <body> I have done a foolish thing. I deleted codeprivate/var/code folder due to malware I was after. I immediately felt that strange things are beginning to happen so I pressed codecmd+Z/code to reverse action. The computer frezzed so I shut it and rerun it. Now I cant relaunch it, because it shuts down while it is loading into my user account.  So I went to single user mode and and tried to copy the codevar/code folder from code.Trashes/code to codeprivate/code folder. The problem is that code.Trashes/code seem to be empty. Meaning that cmd-Z worked, which would mean that var folder is back in place. But the computer doesnt start. Does codels/code command dosnt show files in trash? What seems to be the problem?   Also, if this doesnt work, I am gonna have to copy important files to external disc from Single user mode. What is the path to external harddrive?   EDIT  private/var does indeed have content. I am now getting confused. Did the system put some content in there for me?  <answer236065> If you assume a malware infection, by all means reinstall the OS by rebooting into the Recovery Partition with kbdCmd-R/kbd and reinstall from there. This should not affect your existing users (or their files).  See OS X: About OS X Recovery for details about the procedure.  <comment288768> How did you delete it. Note that delete does not put things in Trash - in Finder Move to Trash does. <comment288770> with cmd-backspace <comment288771> That would have required you to enter an admin password as well <comment288772> It did. An antivirus program pointed out a file in this folder. I inspected the folder and there were a lot of files that I knew were malware. Deleted the entire folder. I am amazed by my stupidity :D <comment288773> In tat case restore from an old backup - before the malware was installed - I'll delete m=y answer as that changes everything - please put the reason in your question <comment288776> Your answer was good and no reason to delete it. I am wondering, if someone else gave me the private/var folder, and I paste the contents into my private/var..would that work? <comment288778> No. The best way would be recover from your own backup. Parts of private/var will regenerate, but not all & not to the state they were in previously. <comment288779> My answer is wrong - if affected by malware you must assume all executable files are corrupted and start from scratch or from a known good state
