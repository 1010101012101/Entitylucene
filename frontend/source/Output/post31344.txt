How can I extract an .xz archive graphically on Mac OS X 10.4? <body> Recent versions of StuffIt will extract code.xz/code archives, but they will not run on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. And using something like Fink, it should be possible to install codexz-utils/code on 10.4, so that code.xz/code archives can be extracted from the Terminal.  But is there any graphical application that will run on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, and which will extract code.xz/code files?  It's OK if this application supports extracting code.tar.xz/code archives in a single step, but not necessary, because if it extracts the code.tar.xz/code file to a code.tar/code file, even an older version of StuffIt can extract that.  <answer31547> I'd give The Unarchiver a try. It's free, graphical, supports 10.4 and can extract code.xz/code archives.  <answer148835> On a mac, you can open up the terminal and use the command codetar -xzf filename.xz/code if you're not looking to download a new App just for code.xz/code archives  <answer151164> The codetar -xzf/code command didn't work for me, but I installed XZ utils http://macpkg.sourceforge.net/ and then codeunxz filename.tar.xz/code.  Then you can just use the command codetar xf filename.tar/code to open the tarball.  I have OSX Mountain Lion (version 10.8.5).  <answer158559> Not graphically, but this showed up in searches so for those of us who want to do it from the command line using Homebrew:   precode$ brew install xz $ xz -d to-extract.xz /code/pre  <answer233635> I've used the following native command on mac:  precodegunzip filename.xz  /code/pre  it works fine!  <comment38871> The Unarchiver is superb. It's my utility of choice even on Lion. <comment99953> It's also available in the Mac App Store, as noted on the linked page. <comment168977> 3 years later - I just found this answer and used it on an `.xz` file in Mavericks. Still works like a charm. <comment175294> Are you sure about that exact command? The `z` flag for tar tells it an is archive gzip-compressed. On systems where tar supports xz, the `J` flag is typically used for that. Or to extract it can simply be omitted; if tar supports a compression method will usually automatically identify it. But *back when I asked this question, I had tried command-line tar on a .tar.xz archive and it hadn't worked.* Assuming it does now, do you know what version of OS X added it? Back when I asked this question, OS X didn't (seem to) ship with xz-utils: i.e., no `xz`, `unxz`, and no `xz` handling in `tar`. <comment177904> The reason is that the option `-z` specifies gzip compression/decompression. The right option for xz is `-J`. But in fact, modern `tar` implementations do not require you to specify the decompression algorithm. Just `tar -xf` is fine. <comment232844> or via macports: `sudo port install xz` <comment272386> Well done - this worked for me to prepare the debian armhf software for my beagle bone black  using `xz` and then `dd` to dump the disk image to the micro SD card. +1 <comment325827> `gunzip` is only used for `.gz` files. <comment333244> Obviously untrue given the answer above. <comment350165> Good on Sierra. <comment350851> On a Sierra system `gunzip` can definitely decompress XZ files out the box. macOS uses the BSD variant of `gzip` linked against `liblzma`, which gives it support for that file format.
