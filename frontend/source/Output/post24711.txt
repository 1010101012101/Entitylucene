Is there a way to add all of the recipients of an email to a group/folder in contacts from Mail? <body> In mail, I'll get email to a list of about 50 people, all of whom need to be in my address book. Is there a way to add them all at once? I can tell it to add one at a time, but I can't seem to get it to do more than that.  <answer25567> Perhaps an AppleScript like this one can help. Note that I'm not really proficient in AppleScript, so I'm sure this can be improved, but no one has answered so far.  precode  tell application "Mail"     set theSelection to selection     set theMessage to item 1 of theSelection     set theSubject to subject of theMessage     tell application "Address Book"         set theGroup to make new group with properties {name:theSubject}     end tell     set theRecipients to to recipients of item 1 of theMessage     repeat with a from 1 to count theRecipients         set theRecipient to item a of theRecipients         tell application "Address Book"             set theName to name of theRecipient             tell application "Mail" to set theAddress to address of theRecipient             set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:name of theRecipient}             make new email at end of emails of thePerson with properties {value:theAddress}             add thePerson to theGroup         end tell     end repeat     set theRecipients to cc recipients of item 1 of theMessage     repeat with a from 1 to count theRecipients         set theRecipient to item a of theRecipients         tell application "Address Book"             set theName to name of theRecipient             tell application "Mail" to set theAddress to address of theRecipient             set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:name of theRecipient}             make new email at end of emails of thePerson with properties {value:theAddress}             add thePerson to theGroup         end tell     end repeat     tell application "Address Book" to save   end tell /code/pre  <comment28972> I've encountered several other people in real life asking this question in the last week. I can't find a built-in way to do this. People I've talked to seem amazed this requires an AppleScript, but it's the only thing I've come up with.
