How do I regain unaccessible free space after a failed Boot Camp install on a non-Fusion drive? <body> Firstly - I know this has been answered, but I am hoping for a more broken down answer, as I am not quite so technically minded, but I can follow instructions!  So in summary I have tried to install windows with bootcamp.  Something failed and I ended up using Disk utility to try and remove the partition created by bootcamp.  Big, silly error I know!  I have followed the threads about backing up then booting to Recovery Mode (Cmd+R) and effectively wiping my SSD then re-installing Yosemite from internet recovery and then restore from my Time Machine back up. (Seems like it will be a late night!)  (The thread I am working off is the question and the answer here.)  However, in the description by @Klanomath, which seems to be a solution there are some blanks in my knowledge as to what exactly to do....  Which command lines do I use as an example.  Here is an abstract of his solution.  And here is the output of my codediskutil cs list/code:  precodeLast login: Wed Mar 4 23:29:13 on console  christophersmbp:~ ChrisMacBookPro$ diskutil cs list  CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +—- Logical Volume Group F4507310-A4BE-400D-A4F9-C2D6248A216C     =========================================================     Name:          Macintosh HD     Status:        Online     Size:          449686106112 B (449.7 GB)     Free Space:    6381568 B (6.4 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 161E9D0A-9DC4-43C4-821F-8333FD14CEBB     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     449686106112 B (449.7 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 5D38BA94-6BFC-415D-A9F1-D443422CA876         ==========================================================         Encryption Status:         Unlocked         Encryption Type:           None         Conversion Status:         NoConversion         Conversion Direction:      -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:     No         Fully Secure:              No         Passphrase Required:       No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume DC2473AF-0833-4DBD-BF8F-D5D60063554A             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          449327398912 B (449.3 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  as well as the output of my codediskutil list/code:  precodechristophersmbp:~ ChrisMacBookPro$ diskutil list                         /dev/disk0                                                                  #                      TYPE NAME                    SIZE    IDENTIFIER     0     GUID_partition_scheme                       *500.3 GB disk0          1                       EFI EFI                    209.7 MB disk0sl        2         Apple_CoreStorage                        449.7 GB disk0s2        3                Apple_Boot Recovery HD            650.0 MB disk0s3        4                       EFI NO NAME                104.9 MB disk0s4     /dev/diskl                                                                  #:                     TYPE NAME                    SIZE    IDENTIFIER     0:                Apple_HFS Macintosh HD          *449.3 GB diskl                                      Logical Volume on     disk0s2                                              DC2473AF-0833-4DBD-BF8F-D5D60063554A                                   Unencrypted                                 /dev/disk2                                                                  #                      TYPE NAME                  SIZE      IDENTIFIER     0     GUID_partition_scheme                       *62.9 GB  disk2          1                       EFI EFI                   209.7 MB  disk2sl        2                 Apple_HFS Nifty SD              62.5 GB   disk2s2     /code/pre  and my Disk Utility GUI:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5PH3.png" alt="Disk Utility"  the output of codesudo gpt -r -vv show /dev/disk0/code  precodegpt show: /dev/disk0: mediasize=500277790720; sectorsize=512; blocks=977105060 gpt show: /dev/disk0: PMBR at sector 0 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Pri GPT at sector 1 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Sec GPT at sector 977105059           start          size      index   contents           0                 1            PMBR           1                 1            Pri GPT header           2                32            Pri GPT table           34                6           40           409600        1   GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B           409640    878293176        2   GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC           878702816   1269536        3   GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC           879972352    204800        4   GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B           880177152  96927875           977105027        32            Sec GPT table           977105059         1            Sec GPT header /code/pre  To summarize - I'd like to get a thickos guide to achieving the resolution, with the info I have provided.  I would also be interested to know if there is an alternative solution that doesn't require wiping my whole system.  IF there are other command lines in terminal that may let me regain control of my hard drive and rejoin them.  I do not have a fusion drive, but I have a 500Gb SSD.  You may also see "Nifty Drive" in the CS list, that is just a memory card.  Also my first time on a forum, so hello!  <answer175501> This should be one way to regain your unused space. There might be a better (or more elegant) solution, but since i don't have a spare Mac at the moment (and it doesn't work in a virtual environment) i can't figure that out.  The solution outlined here removes any partition which obstructs the expansion of the CoreStorage Volume Group. Then the physical (CoreStorage) volume and afterwards the logical (CoreStorage) volume will be expanded non-destructively to almost full size. At the end the Recovery HD deleted previously will be restored by reinstalling the current system.  Initial state (disk0 is your physical device and disk1 is a "virtual" CoreStorage device - the disk identifier may vary depending on your setup):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KtQCI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Final state:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZZ47p.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongPreparation:/strong    ul liBackup your data./li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite).  Below I assume that the disk identifier of your Internet Recovery HD (OS X Base System) or thumb drive is disk1, disk0 is your SSD, and disk2 your CoreStorage Logical Volume. Disk3 - ~ disk14 are used by Internet Recovery Mode. Don't mess around with them.br LVUUID: UUID of the logical volume.

You need to try reinstalling windows by using bootcamp and then uninstall it. When you ask bootcamp to delete the partition used for windows, it will also "delete" the free space.
