OS X 10.9.4 Apple preview - can you rotate in inserted rectangle? <body> The updated version of Preview has so many features I can use it instead of the complicated photoshop. However I have found there is no way to rotate/angle an inserted rectangle or square. can it be done?  <answer154532> You can only rotate an inserted shape by going to strongTools  Rotate Left/Right.../strong  <comment181810> This rotates the whole image not just the inserted shape
