How to click the mouse buttons with a keyboard shortcut? <body> I have an application without keyboard shortcuts where I have to do a recursive work, in practice I have to insert fields with keyboard and click the mouse button over the codeOK/codebutton so I have to switch between keyboard and mouse very often only to click without moving the mouse. I know that in codeSystem Preference-&gt;Acessibility/code I can enable mouse keys but if I have to press codealt/codefive times before I can use the mouse and then I can't no more type with the keyboard until I disable the mouse keys I lose more time then the first solution.  Put the mouse in the floor and press the button with the foot's finger is an alternative but other users may not approve it.
