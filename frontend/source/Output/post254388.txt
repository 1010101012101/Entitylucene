How to turn off auto response suggestions in iOS 10 <body> I am not referring to the predictive text functionality.  For example, if someone sends a simple question to you like "who are you" the keyboard will automatically suggest your name.  This is because it is scanning your text for such things.  I would like to shut this off.  Any ideas?  <comment316723> @fbara Except that he says he's not talking about the predictive functionality. He's talking about the keyboard making suggestions before you've even started typing something. <comment316737> It might be helpful for us if you can explain why you want to do this or what you hope to achieve. <comment316754> @Monomeeth Yes, and that's part of predictive text. The way it's explained by the OP, that other question & answer is the way to do what they want. <comment316755> @fbara Ok thanks, that's good to know.
