Creating OS X Mountain Lion app from an OS X Mountain Lion DVD <body> I am trying to upgrade an early MacPro 1.1 from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion but the process I am using involves accessing the strongemInstall OS X Mountain Lion app/em/strong which was formerly downloadable from the App Store.   I don't have the app on my hard drive.  Instead, I have a bootable Mountain Lion install DVD. My question is:  can I use this DVD to make an app (which I can put on my hard drive) which is identical to the Install App from the App Store?  In other words, it's the opposite of the process which most people want to do!  (Because my MacPro 1.1 is unsupported for Mountain Lion, I am unable to use this DVD to install Mountain Lion)  I should mention that on the same MacPro I have already successfully installed Yosemite on a different partition.  What I want now is a partition for Mountain Lion.  Please don't ask me WHY!!! Just believe me when I say I am not collecting Mac operating systems!  Thanks for any suggestions or workarounds.   <comment263360> "...but the process I am using involves accessing...ML.app" Please add a link to the description of the "process". I assume it's a hack to include the MacPro 1.1 as a legit machine in the installer. <comment263362> I just looked under Purchased in the App Store and I see it's available for download. So if you've downloaded the OS X Mountain Installer in the past then you can still download it again. <comment263394> thanks for the replies. I am using MLPostFactor to install Mountain Lion on a partition.   Here is a link to the process:  https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0ahUKEwiLveHE5LvJAhWGshQKHc2cCIQQFggpMAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.macrumors.com%2Fthreads%2Fguide-success-install-10-8-on-old-unsupported-mac.1325709%2F&usg=AFQjCNFMo_uB4Q4pLa6mHqOv-ihyZ_341Q&sig2=ci09SN6dvjs3jdhbSkiSig&bvm=bv.108538919,d.d24&cad=rja  But MLPostFactor needs the Mountain Lion Install app.  ... and I didn't download the Installer from the App Store, so can't re-download.
