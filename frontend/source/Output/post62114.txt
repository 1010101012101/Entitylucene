Can I use my Macbook Pro Retina as a monitor for PS3? <body> I want to connect my PlayStation3 to my Retina Macbook Pro so that I can play my games using the MBP's display, is it possible to do it with HDMI port or something else?   <answer62117> No, the video ports (HDMI and Thunderbolt) are output only. The MacBooks aren't designed to function as monitors.  You emcould/em try getting a video capture device that supports live viewing, but the performance and quality are likely to be far from optimalâ€”such solutions are designed for recording video, not live playback or gaming.  <comment187787> Thunderbolt is definitely not output only <comment218788> Just to clarify, Thunderbolt is not output only, but as a video port, it is.
