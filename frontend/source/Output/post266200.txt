Install Windows 10 on VMWare Fusion 8.5.3 <body> I have a MacBook Pro running MacOS 10.12.2. It has VMWare Fusion 8.5.3. I have a Windows 10 strongusb install thumb drive/strong for installing both 32bit and 64bit Windows.  How do I install 64 bit windows into a virtual machine?  I have tried to Google, but it keeps turning up instructions for how to install using an iso image.  I have looked at the USB drive and cannot find iso images.  I have tried:  ol liFile-New ... /li liCreate a custom virtual machine/li liDrop disk image into the file selector window that pops up./li /ol  <answer266248> I ended up downloading the ISO from Microsoft and installing it from the ISO.  I try not to accept my own answers so if someone wants to post this as the definitive answer explaining why the USB drive is not suitable for installation I will delete this answer and accept yours.
