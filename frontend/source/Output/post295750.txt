Firewall program for Java required <body> I am looking for a Java firewall program to run through my compiler as I am not good enough to make my own code.  <comment373505> Welcome to Ask Different! Is this somehow Apple related? <comment373560> Appleâ€™s built-in application-level firewall found in the System Preferences of macOS applies to every Java process as like any other application. Ditto for the packet-level firewall [*PF*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF_(firewall)) built into macOS. Nothing special about Java with regard to these firewalls; Java is just another process or app.
