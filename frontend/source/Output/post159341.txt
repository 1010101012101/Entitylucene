How to turn on voice dictation in Yosemite using a voice command? <body> Is there any way to turn on the built-in voice dictation in Yosemite with a voice command (just like we can do using the voice command "wake up" in Dragon NaturallySpeaking, or "Hey Siri" in Siri)?  <answer159353> Apple says:  Enable Dictation Commands  Before you can tell your Mac what you want it to do, you need to turn on Dictation Commands.     When you enable advanced commands, you can also create your own   commands by clicking the Add Command (+) button. This lets you link a   spoken phrase to an app, a menu item, a keyboard shortcut, or an   Automator workflow.
