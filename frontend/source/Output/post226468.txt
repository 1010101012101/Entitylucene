Is it possible to get contacts from stolen iPhone 3GS? <body> I had an iPhone 3GS that was stolen (I don't remember the iOS version). Is there a way I can get my contacts that were on the phone?  <answer226473> You have a few options.  ol liRestore from backup to another iPhone. If you do not have access to another iPhone, but have a backup file through iTunes locally on your computer, there are applications that can process those backup files. You may have success in browsing through them./li liIf you were using iCloud, then your contacts may have been syncing there. Login at http://www.icloud.com/ to see if they are there. Perhaps you had contacts syncing with another account, like one you used for email? Check there./li /ol
