How to resize the main volume to its original or full size? <body> I followed the instructions mentioned in one of the threads on this community to expand the Macintosh HD volume to its full volume. I rebooted with kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd to Recovery Mode, opened Terminal, entered codediskutil cs list/code and it said: "No Core storage logical volume found". What does that mean and how to get through?   I need to merge the blank space of my HD with Macintosh HD and make it one.

In your case, the drive does not have any core storage partitions. Your question does not contain enough information to determine what hidden partitions may exist on your drive. To determine this you would need to edit your question and add the output from the following commands.  precodediskutil list sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  You should enter these commands while booted normally to OS X. Some commands may ask for your login password. This is normal.  Assuming you just have a EFI partition closely preceding and a Recovery HD partition closely succeeding the Mackintosh HD partition, you can add the blank space to this partition by following these steps.  ol liBoot normally to OS X./li liSetup the Disk Utility application just as shown in your image./li liEnter a new size of 1000 GB, then press the kbdreturn/kbd key. The size should change to the maximum value./li liClick the Apply button. Note: This can take a while if there is a hidden Recovery HD partition./li /ol  <comment255364> @DavidAnderson: Below is the output of your said commands:  MacBook-Pro:~ demo$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            189.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 <comment255365> This is the output of your said command:  MacBook-Pro:~ demo$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            189.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 <comment255426> Actually, if you look above this comment, there is a "edit" label you can click on to edit your question. This is where you should post the output from the commands. <comment255427> Based on the output from `diskutil list`, there is a good chance the steps I gave in my answer will work.
