Is Intel Iris 1536 MB ‘better’ than Intel HD Graphics 4000? <body> I'm looking at a game which gives 'Intel HD Graphics 4000' as one of its requirements. My Macbook Pro Retina mid-2014 has 'Intel Iris 1536 MB'; will that be OK?  <answer275853> Yes, the Iris Pro should be enough for the game. The HD 4000 is included in the Mid-2012 MacBook Pro so yours is newer than it, so definitely will work.  <answer275854> There are 3 types of mid 2014, two with integrated graphics &amp; one with a discrete card.  The integrated chip is Intel 5100 or 5200 so yes, well within spec, even if you don't have the dual-graphics version with a GeForce GT 750M.  Source: Everymac
