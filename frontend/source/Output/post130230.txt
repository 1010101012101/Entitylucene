Guest works for me. Sometimes writing nothing also works for me.  hr  I think you should use an external mouse or another mouse and use a Mac mouse for example the mighty mouse or something like that because you are using a Mac Machine / VM.  hr  My suggestion is that you should follow the steps I provided because, you never know, this might actually work out.  hr  h1Notice :/h1  If you think I posted something wrong on this topic or you need to edit / suggest something please leave a reply.  <answer140048> Username: root     Password: niresh  <comment152572> both user name and password : admin - FAILED <comment152573> both user name and password : guest - FAILED <comment152574> both user name and password : blank - FAILED | Any other idea? <comment152660> Hmm. Did you download the copy from apple or from a website? <comment161596> Because, if you did. The copy, the owner of the copy has the password, contact him. <comment165049> One question per question is the best for the site. Glad someone got you the answer you needed, though...
