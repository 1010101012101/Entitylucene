How can I get my mail rules from Mavericks to Sierra without doing them over one by one <body> Or how can I export them?  Or even just print them?  There are far too many for me to do them over.  <answer276795> There are a couple of things you emcan/em try, but these seem to be a bit hit and miss (i.e. they don't seem to work in all cases).   Before I go any further, Apple Mail rules are stored in a property list at: code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/SyncedRules.plist/code  strongNotes:/strong   ul liThe "~" in the above path denotes your user account name. /li liThe "Library" folder is hidden by default. In order to see it, go to the Finder and while you press and hold the kbdoption/kbd key, click on the Go menu and select emLibrary/em from the drop-down menu./li liIn your case it may not be in the 'V2' folder - it could be in a 'V3' etc, but in Mavericks the default was 'V2' and in macOS Sierra it should be 'V4'./li /ul  strongMethod 1 - copy the SyncedRules.plist file/strong  This is what I'm guessing you've already tried. Namely, find the correct copy of your rules .plist file and copy/restore this across to the correct location within your new macOS Sierra location. By correct location I mean that in macOS Sierra there will probably be a new 'V4' folder - so copy the file into that folder!  strongMethod 2 - create a new user account/strong  This method involves creating a new user account but not enabling iCloud in it so you can access all your old rules.  More specifically:  ul liGo to Apple  System Preferences/li liSelect Users &amp; Groups/li liCreate a new User Account (you may need to unlock the padlock in order to do this)/li liIn Login Options ensure you have emAutomatic Login/em set to off, and that you have emShow fast user switching menu/em enabled/li liExit System Preferences/li liLog into your new user account but strongdo not log in to iCloud/strong (i.e. totally skip this step)/li liCopy across your V2 or V3 etc folder into the Mail folder located strongwithin/strong the user's library folder (see notes at beginning of answer on how to make the library folder visible)/li liNow open Mail/li liThis should start a process to copy across all your Mail data from the V2 or V3 or V4 etc folder you copied across/li /ul  Once finished, you emshould/em be able to see your rules etc. If you can, you can try to copy across this new folder to your other user's account (however, be aware this may not be preferable as you will replace existing data that may be more recent - although you could try just copying across the emSyncedRules.plist/em file. Remember to copy it across to the correct location (see Method 1 above). However, if you have iCloud enabled, you may want to also copy this across to the  If this doesn't work, but you can see the rules, then at least you can now see them if you need to take screenshots etc to recreate them.  Let me know how you go - especially if you feel you're close but just not quite there.   <comment346738> Can you please provide more details re your situation? Are you transferring from one computer to another computer? Are you upgrading a single computer from Mavericks to Sierra? Or are your Mavericks rules data stored in some sort of backup? Something else? <comment346881> I have an old MBP with Mavericks. I have a new MBP with Sierra. I transferred the old mail on the old MBP to the new MBP.

Mail that wasn't in local mailboxes was and is still on imap servers. Local mailboxes all imported perfectly. Folder hierarchy was preserved. Now I want my rules to be applied to my inbox so I can move the mail out and into the local boxes. But there are no rules. I transferred the old rules plist but they are not seen. I have lots of email addresses and lots of rules. Too painful to do one by one again. Especially if I can't see them. <comment348333> Anybody have any solutions?
