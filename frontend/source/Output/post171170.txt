Best way to stream video from iPad or iPhone to Macbook ? <body> I am planning to create some app tutorials (screencasts) using Screenflow on my Macbook   The apps are iPhone and iPad apps so I want to show the live app in the tutorial and mix in other aspects which Screenflow lets you do.  I think therefore I just need to get the iPad to stream to a Window on my macbook - then I can capture it.  I have an Apple TV and I think I read that this is the best way to do this -  but not sure the exact set up - can anyone advise?  <answer171213> If you have an iOS 8 device with a Lightning cable (i.e. no iPhone 4S) and Yosemite, you can do this without an Apple TV.  ol liPlug in your iDevice to your Mac./li liOpen QuickTime./li liClick File  New Movie Recording./li liSelect your iDevice as the input source./li /ol  You can find these instructions online with pictures here.  <answer171241> I use AirVideo to stream to my computers, it does have a minimal cost and works well.  <answer231762> You can use Reflector to do this. I do it my self. It cost 15 dollars and streams to you computer via AirPlay.  Check it out here.  http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/  <comment201392> The Apple TV will not do this is the way that you're asking, the Apple TV is good for connecting to an actual TV or Monitor not to another Mac. <comment201556> Air Video site says it "allows you to stream video from your computer to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch" but I want to go the other direction - will it do that? http://www.inmethod.com/index.html <comment201558> Yes, download the server version for OS X  and your iPhone/iPad will see your Mac as an AirPlay device to stream to. <comment201559> Thanks that is really helpful , there are links there for non Yosemite too. (I need to upgrade)
