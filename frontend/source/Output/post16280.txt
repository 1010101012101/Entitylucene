Dual screens with different resolutions <body> I have my MBP connected to another screen with a smaller resolution. Thus when I want to move a window on the other screen, I have to resize it first to that it fits, then I can make it full screen again.  Is there a more convenient way to do that ?  <answer16282> I recommend that you use a window manager. I use strongDivvy/strong ($14), which lets me press a one keyboard shortcut to move a window to the other monitor and resize it to full-screen.  <answer16284> I'll recommend a similar product Size Up which lets you move and resize windows with keyboard shortcuts.  Its $13 nagware, so free if you don't mind it pestering you occasionally.  <comment17780> Take a look at the different alternatives we've found so far in AskDifferent: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/9659/115 <comment171822> I do this all the time by just moving the window to the other screen and hitting "+" button. Recently, this method started acting funny but then a reboot solved it.  Is this not working for you?  I have OS X 10.8.3 and MBP late edition 2010.
