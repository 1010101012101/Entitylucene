Remove mysql 5.6.26-community <body> I installed this version of mysql with the script here, but I don't know how to remove it. It isn't in the applications folder. It's here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Srvqi.png" alt="enter image description here"  I wish if someone could tell me how to completely remove it. Thanks!  <answer210671> All the paths to where mysql is installed is in the script.  Under code/usr/local/mysql/code the script has installed mysql - so it should just be deleting this mysql folder, that would remove it.  <answer210672> To uninstall all files/packages installed by the shell script simply undo all commands executed in the script logged in with an admin account:  ol liOpen System Preferences - MySQL and stop the service if it's running/li liOpen the folder /Applications and drag SequelPro - if it was installed - to your trash./li liOpen Terminal and enter codesudo rm -R /usr/local/mysql-5.6.26-osx10.8-x86_64/code to remove the mysql folder/li liEnter codesudo rm /usr/local/mysql/code to remove the soft link/li liEnter codecd /Library/LaunchDaemons &amp;&amp; ls/code/li liSearch for the *.mysql.plist (the launch daemon plist of mysql) and remove it with codesudo rm com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist/code./li liRemove the my.cnf file with codesudo rm /etc/my.cnf/code/li liRemove the mysql socket soft link and the superior folder with codesudo rm -R /var/mysql/code/li liRemove all installed mysql package receipts with codesudo pkgutil --forget package-id/code.br Example: codesudo pkgutil --forget com.mysql.launchd/code The name of the other two packages are emcom.mysql.mysql/em and emcom.mysql.prefpane/em/li liRemove the file MySQL.prefPane in em/Library/PreferencePanes//em/li liFinally cd to /usr/local/bin and check the existence as well as the creation/modification date of the file empidof/em. Remove it if both dates match with the installation date of mysql./li /ol  hr  Addendum  To remove the MySQL installation from System Info - Software - Installations (which is a "cosmetic problem" only) remove the MySQL dict entry:  precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;date&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;date&gt;2015-10-13T15:06:35Z&lt;/date&gt;     &lt;key&gt;displayName&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;MySQL 5.6.26-community&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;displayVersion&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;packageIdentifiers&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;com.mysql.mysql&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;com.mysql.prefpane&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;com.mysql.launchd&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;processName&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;installer&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  by editing the file InstallHistory.plist in /Library/Receipts/ with codesudo nano /Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist/code or with TextWrangler.  <comment254209> How did you install it? Drag the App or from a .pkg file? <comment254210> @IronCraftMan I installed with this command: `bash (curl -Ls http://git.io/eUx7rg)` from here [link](http://www.macminivault.com/mysql-yosemite/) <comment254212> going to the GitHub link from the article, it appears as if there's not way to uninstall it. I would recommend staying away from the types of software that can't be removed. <comment254213> @IronCraftMan Oh, I'm new in OS X and didn't know that. <comment254214> also, it appears as if you installed from a .pkg. I can't read whatever language your system is in, but "Instalacions" is fairly close to Installations. Here's an app that will remove the file(s): [UninstallPKG](https://www.corecode.at/uninstallpkg/). If you don't want to pay, this is a link to manually uninstalling it: [article](https://wincent.com/wiki/Uninstalling_packages_(.pkg_files)_on_Mac_OS_X) <comment254215> @IronCraftMan Thanks, I installed. But in the list does not appear nothing with that installation. Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/beBbzLm.jpg?1) <comment254247> For `sudo` to work you need to have administrator rights. <comment254307> @klanomath Hi, thanks for answering. I follow all your steps. But it continues appearing in the System Preferences  Software  Installations I found this file InstallHistory.plist  `dict   keydate/key   date2015-10-12T23:24:29Z/date   keydisplayName/key   stringMySQL 5.6.26-community/string   keydisplayVersion/key   string/string   keypackageIdentifiers/key       stringcom.mysql.mysql/string    stringcom.mysql.prefpane/string    stringcom.mysql.launchd/string   /array   keyprocessName/key   stringinstaller/string  /dict` <comment254310> @klanomath Could it be that in System Preferences  Software  Installations appears that mysql but as a old installation just to keep a history, or it indicates that it remains in the system. <comment254323> @klanomath In step 9 I got this output from the terminal `No receipt for 'com.mysql.prefpane' found at '/'.` <comment254326> @Joseph That's ok. You already deleted them manually. I modified my answer in step 9 expecting that it also changes the installHistory file but it doesn't. Instead you have to do it manually: see the addendum <comment254327> @klanomath It says that its block and I don't have the permision to edit it... <comment254328> @Joseph You may do it with `sudo nano /Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist` or with [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) using your admin account. <comment254338> @klanomath with that I finally could delete mysql! Thanks for answered all my questions!
