Mac/PC: How to change the developer of an Apple Disk Image? <body> I am trying to use a GD-0912-U Intuos Graphics Tablet in OS X El Capitanâ€Ž at a public hackerspace. They will let me install any programs on the iMac, barring that Gatekeeper believes it is from a trusted developer.  I have been able to get this tablet working in Windows 7 by installing older drivers that were found online. This tablet is obviously not going to work with current Intuos drivers.  I have managed to find drivers that will likely work, but I cannot install them unless the OS believes that the app is from a trusted developer. New drivers downloaded from the Wacom website install perfectly, and show that Wacom is the official developer. It seems that the old drivers were created before Gatekeeper existed; therefore, they do not have the proper developer information.  Is there a way to alter developer information on an Apple Disk Image?  Could I take information from recent Intuos drivers and copy it into the .dmg?  <answer237509> No. The developer certificate signs the application and any modification of the seal will make the validation fail.   Basically any trivial cut and paste won't work. You would need to:  ul lisign up as a developer and sign your package/li liget permission from Apple to sign kernel extensions if that is the nature of the driver/li liwork with the maintainers of the lab to find and install drivers for your hardware. /li /ul  <answer237558> You strongcan/strong install the drivers on your Mac (but I dont't know if they'll work properly) All you have to do is to stop temporary Gatekeeper:  ul liOpen the dlmg package/li liPress the ctrl key on your keyboard, and click once on the pkg file, you'll see a local menu./li liClick "Open", you'll see the Gatekeeper alert, but with another button: "Open"/li liClick on open, and the installation will begin!/li /ul
