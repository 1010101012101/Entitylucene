Apple tv works via menu bar but not app specific streaming <body> So I have a Gen 4 apple tv, which works fine in the menu bar icon dropdown. I see my apple tv and it can mirror my screen fine.  However, if I open a video in itunes or use beamer to try and stream to my Apple TV, the device is not in the list of available TV's.  I have no idea why this is.  Any advice or help?   <comment321200> Take a look at [this Apple Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201343) and see if it helps.
