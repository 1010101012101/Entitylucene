How can I temporarily disable my MBP's keyboard? <body> I sometimes bring my external keyboard with me on the go and use it with my MBP. I would like to lay it over the macbook's current keyboard without having to worry about it pressing other keys.  strongIs there a way to temporarily enable/disable the onboard keyboard?/strong  <answer141779> You can use strongKeyboardCleanTool/strong to lock/unlock the keyboard using the mouse.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LkWlE.png" width="560"
