Permitting an application (OmniFocus) to open linked files <body> OmniFocus, a task management application, supports linking to files by pasting the file path in the notes field of a task. The link could be a URL or a file path. Prior to Mac OS Sierra, I was able to click on a link and the file would open. Now I get this error:     The application “OmniFocus” does not have permission to open “Questions about Portfolio for Feedback.txt.”   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zlug5.png" alt="Error Message"  Is there a way in Mac OS Sierra to grant OmniFocus (or any application for that matter) permission to open files linked within the application?
