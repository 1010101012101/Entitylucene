Connecting an iPad to a printer on another (LAN) network <body> I am wondering if it is possible to issue a command to print a PDF file from my iPad (connected to a WiFi network), to a printer which is connected to a LAN, provided I know the (global) IP address or URL of the printer.  I routinely print research papers, and to do this, I have to issue a command from a Mac or a laptop to print the PDF file. But I'd like to be able to do this from my iPad.  Is this possible? I haven't found any app on the App Store which can do this, but I haven't tried all possible apps of course.  <answer249621> For many years, I have been using Readdle's Printer Pro application for iOS. The app costs a few dollars, but seems to do the trick for me. It also works with all other Readdle apps, such as Scanner Pro, and Documents 5.

But according to the app description, it seems to be an interface between your iPad and a Mac connected to the printer. Does this app work if I just have an iPad and the printer is a network printer, not connected to a computer? <comment309713> The app works without a mac interface. It only needs the IP of the printer. Can put up screenshots if needed. <comment309717> http://imgur.com/6cHNWgg
