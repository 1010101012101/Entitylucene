Early '11 MBP battery slowdown <body> I have a weird one for you all.   Early 2011 MBP 15" the battery is shot (unplug and immediately turns off)  The MBP runs unbelievably slow (2009 unibody 13 MacBook runs faster) I did a little research and macs slow their clock speed when there is a battery issue in order to protect the computer.  But here's the odd part: if I open the MBP up and disconnect the battery it speeds back up.  Not sure why? Any insight? Also any way to tell if it's still running at a slowed down clock speed?  Thanks for any insight   <comment336990> Well if you unplug the battery, I'd guess that the computer knows that there is no battery. I'd suggest replacing the battery. It's not that expensive, ~$100 USD, and it might solve both of your problems (lack of battery life and slow computer)
