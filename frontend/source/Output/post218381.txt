Audio from Lightning dock? <body> Is Apple the only company that makes an iPhone dock with an audio out jack (3.5mm) that gets the audio straight from the Lightning port... as opposed to a separate audio plug? See example below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iaaRZ.png" alt="enter image description here"   I'm looking for something that won't bend my cable as I intend to thread it and undo it several times.  <answer219509> I can only find one other manufacturer, but I guess that's sufficient to say Apple are strongnot/strong the only company to make a dock with audio out from the Lightning port.  Henge Docks Gravitas can do this.  It's not completely clear from the web page that there is no separate audio plug going into the phone, but the user guide is clearer.br This structure enables you to have the phone connected to both computer/charger &amp; external speakers, simultaneously.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7guA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment264022> @bmike Thanks... but doesn't this edit make it _more_ about hardware shopping now? My original question was less "what thing should I buy" and more "how come Apple's thing can do something that third party things can't." As mentioned, Apple's dock gets the audio straight from the Lightning port. I haven't seen other docks that do that... so the question really is, can they? <comment264030> I also steered it away from "Why does Apple do X - which also is off topic" - can they is a problematic "ask" for software and engineering. It's all a matter of money, time and constraints. We're here for practical questions that can have answers that objectively are right or wrong. Yes/no type questions are better suited elsewhere... Hit us up on [meta] if you get lost in the weeds on all the "guidance" - comments are too short to convey several posts in [help]. <comment264063> @bmike Ah. Thanks for the clarification.
