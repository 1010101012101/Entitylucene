Networking with a Dual Band Router <body> I recently introduced a dual-band router into my home network, which includes two laptops (mine and my wife's), an AppleTV, and a headless Mac Mini running as a home server. The router is a Linksys AC1200  I initially set the dual band networks up to have the same name and password, but I've found that now the AppleTV, the server, and my laptop (which I often use to control the server via Screen Sharing) are having a hard time finding each other. Do I need to force them to be on the same band? Or should the router be able to handle this, which seems like a pretty common use case?  Thanks for any advice!  <comment208179> didn't it say somewhere they have to be on same network (same channel) <comment208184> No the problem is something else.  The router will handle finding all devices on both wireless networks and any wired devices.  In general, it seems to be best to use different SSID's (i add a suffix of 5 to the end of the SSID for the 5ghz network) so that you can tell which the device is connected to.   Also I had a different linksys EA series router that seemed to have a firmware bug where apple devices would frequently change IPs, the workaround was to set DHCP reservations. <comment208185> CORRECTION: "The router will handle finding all devices on both wireless _bands_ and any wired devices."  They should in fact all be joining the same local network regardless which transport got them connected to it.
