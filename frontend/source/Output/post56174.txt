Why does my terminal show a string like this? <body> When I open my terminal it shows this:  precodewpa-2-602:~ david$ /code/pre  I just curious what the codewpa-2-602/code means? "david" is my user name, and sometimes it was something else. What makes it change?  <answer56176> That's based on the codePS1/code variable set in Bash's initialization. Yours appears to be the default, which is your computer's name, followed by a colon, then the current directory (in your example, that'd be the home directory for your computer [~]), then your username (david).  Here is an article about customizing your PS1, and there are plenty of questions both here and over at Super User about changing and fixing it.  <comment64501> The computer's name will be used unless the dhcp client get's another host name when connecting to a network.  My guess is that the OP is noticing the name change when he's on a network whose dhcp server actually responds to the host name request from his computer. <comment64555> Any particular complaint from the downvoter?
