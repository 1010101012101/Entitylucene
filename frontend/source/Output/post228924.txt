How on earth do I get iTunes to play an album? <body> I tried the old right click and select play on the drop down menu trick. Which didn't work.   Now I'm fresh out of ideas.  I'm using Vista Home and iTunes 12.0.1.26.  <answer228926> ol liOn iTunes set to Music, on the top-right corner, select "Albums"./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/31Ngx.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liChoose the album you want to play./li liPress the "play" button on the screen it will open. This will reproduce the entire album's songs./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Wwjo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment279336> Unfortunately that doesn't work on my pc. I would have thought it would but no. My wife said that she found that her iTunes went crazy if she didn't update it, so maybe that's my problem. I don't see why it would be though, if I'm not updating anything else and it used to work fine. The only thing I can think of is that Apple is telling my iTunes to crap itself so that I'll update it. <comment279337> Which I find quite disgusting. I already hate Macs as it is, since I can't use them and this is just another reason to hate apple, if it is actually the case.
