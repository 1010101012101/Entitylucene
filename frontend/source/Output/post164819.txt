script to preview two .png s side by side? <body> I want to display A.png and B.png together, A left / B right or A top / B bottom.br I can of course  precodepreview A.png preview B.png /code/pre  separately, then resize and move the two windows next to each other, but that's a pain if you do it a lot.  Can it be scripted ?br If not, is there an opensource preview-like that can display side-by-side ?  (I have 10.8.3 . if-preview-app-in-os-x-is-not-applescriptable-why-does-this-work on SO has a comment "Preview does have an AppleScript dictionary by default in 10.9 but not in earlier versions of OS X." )  <answer164820> Open the two files with Preview, then run the following to position the windows:  precodetell application "Preview"     activate     set the bounds of the first window to {0, 0, 700, 1000}     set the bounds of the second window to {700, 0, 1400, 1000} end tell /code/pre  Customise the coordinates as you wish depending on monitor resolution.br Syntax: {ix/isub1/sub, iy/isub2/sub, ix/isub1/sub, iy/isub2/sub}  Enable AppleScript in Preview in OS X â‰¤10.8 by quitting Preview and running:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview NSAppleScriptEnabled -bool true /code/pre  <answer164889> I would do this in Automator as a Service. Using a strongOpen Images in Preview/strong Action and a strongRun Applescript/strong Action.  So I could select the wo files and run the service on them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IX5Od.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Applescript code should get the Size of the screen and set the bound of the windows accordingly.  precodeset bnds to "" tell application "Finder" to set bnds to (get bounds of window of desktop)  set FullWinWidth to (item 3 of bnds) set halfWinWidth to (item 3 of bnds) / 2 set winHeight to (item 4 of bnds)  tell application "Preview"     if (count of windows) &gt; 1 then         activate         try             set the bounds of the first window to {0, 0, halfWinWidth, winHeight}             set the bounds of the second window to {halfWinWidth, 0, FullWinWidth, winHeight}         end try     end if end tell /code/pre  As grgarside points out you can run  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview NSAppleScriptEnabled -bool true /code/pre  to make Preview.app scriptable for something like these simple commands.
