Are there any audiobook apps that will remember where you last left off? <body> As the title suggests are there any apps that will remember where in the audiobook you last left off and pick up from there when you play it?  Also I use the term audiobook here loosely, my books are just mp3 files not ones purchased through itunes or anything. Some of them don't even have meta data that breaks the file into chapters, etc.  So really I just need a simple app that will pick up any mp3 file where you last left off and you should be able to play several mp3 files it will remember where you left off on all of them.  I'm using an iPhone 6S running IOS version 10.3.1  <answer282161> You can use Apple's iBooks app for iPhone/iPad to playback audio books and mp3 files and resume playback. With mp3s you may need to change the "media kind" option from Music to Audiobook in iTunes.  Import your audiobooks or mp3s to iTunes. Select your mp3 file in iTunes, right click and select Get Info from the pop up menu (or just press Command I) to get into the file's properties window. Click on the Options tab then change media kind from Music to Audiobook.  You can then sync your mp3/audiobooks from iTunes to your iPhone if you select to sync manually or sync everything  <comment355221> Plex can be configured in that way
