Finder won't remember window size in Yosemite <body> In previous versions there was a way to set the window configuration as default. But now in Yosemite they seem to have got rid of this option.  There is however a way to make it remember for a while with codeoption + drag/code a new (untouched) finder window. But this won't last long. After a while or a restart the window is back to stock settings.  Is this a bug? Because I can't recall experiencing this in previous versions of OS X. If not, is there a way to set a default window configuration?  <answer154559>   I don't know any way to change the default window size, but you can use a script like this to reset the properties of windows manually:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "Finder"     if number of Finder windows is 0 then return     tell Finder window 1         set toolbar visible to false         set sidebar width to 0         set statusbar visible to false         set current view to column view         set bounds to {960, 22, 1920, 1076}         tell its column view options             set shows icon to false         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment185312> Having this same issue... I tried setting Finder windows to the way I want them and then locking the .DS_Store files. I tried removing every .DS_Store file on the file system. It seems like the Finder is just ignoring settings... Very odd and random. Wish I had something more useful to contribute. <comment197899> For what it's worth, my Finder windows have never remembered their size, long before Yosemite... <comment243116> Performing a full system cleanup with Onyx. Also removing Finder preferences from the Library might help too.
