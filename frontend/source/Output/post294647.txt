looking for the IPSec config 10.12.6 <body> I am trying to get my Ubuntu 17.04 machine to connect to my employer's VPN (using l2tp and IPSec).  My Mac (10.12.6 Sierra) connects just fine, but the Linux box seems to get hung up on Phase 2 (I think).  Is there any way I can see the "hidden" settings that the Mac is using?  Specifically I would like to see the phase 2 algorithms it is using and try to mimic those settings on my Linux box.  I have looked at the ppp.log file but it does not contain the information I need.  Thanks!  <comment371949> Not sure if this will help, but try turning on "Verbose Logging" in the advanced settings of the VPN connection. <comment372049> I gave that a shot but I didn't see anything that might help me. Thanks anyway. I think I'm narrowing down the issue in three Linux side (it is using IKEv2 while my office is still using IKEv1).
