How to sort icons shown with F10? <body> I use a pdf viewer and have tons of open windows. I use F10 to select a document. However, I could not determine the criteria that MacOS uses for sorting these documents. Is there a rule? Can it be changed for instance to sort alphabetically?  <comment99517> Which version of OS X are you using? <comment99518> If you're using Exposé, try pressing cmd-1 after you press F10. I think that was it, but I haven't had a Mac with Exposé in some time. <comment99700> I use 10.8.2. I guess it is not called Expose any longer, but I do not know how to call this view that you get with F10. <comment99709> Mission Control
