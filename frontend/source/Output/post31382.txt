How to tell if it is Wireless-G or Wireless-N that the iMac is using? <body> I sometimes see the iMac copying files from the PC wirelessly at a rate of 1.5MB/s and sometimes 2.5MB/s (by visually examining, because Mac doesn't seem to show what the speed is in the copy dialog).  Is there a way to find out whether my iMac is connected to the wired PC through the wireless router using Wireless-G or Wireless-N?  Can some app show and/or the terminal app show?  <answer31386> kbdOption/kbd + click your menu bar's status icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnCDE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment36130> interesting... quite many of the Mac functions are hidden and can be invoked using the Option key... <comment36195> OPtion clicking the sound icon in the menubar also lets ur easily switch ur sound I/O <comment93481> wow that is so useful!  no need to bring up the System Preferences every time <comment169249> How did you grab that screenshot? <comment169258> Commamd shift 4, then press space
