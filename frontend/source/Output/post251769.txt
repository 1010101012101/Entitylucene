Macbook EFI parition after reFind <body> I have a question about what should be located in the EFI partition of my macbook. A couple of years ago I dual booted ubuntu with reFind, however recently I erased my main partition to clean up my mac. Now I would like to dual boot arch also using reFind, so I mounted my EFI partition and found this:  precodeBOOTLOG BOOTLOG.OLD screenshot__001.bmp screenshot__002.bmp EFI/     APPLE/          CACHES/             CAFEBEEF/                 (empty)         EXTENSIONS/             Firmware.scap         FIRMWARE/             MBP91_00D3_B0D_LOCKED.scap     Ubuntu/     tools/         gptsync_x64.efi          reFind/  /code/pre  So I deleted the ubuntu and reFind directories since I want to start with a fresh install of reFind. My question is were the files contained in the APPLE and tools directories created from the old reFind install, in which case I can delete them, or are they integral to the standard mac boot process (so I shouldn't mess with them)?  <answer251774> You can delete everything from the EFI partition if you wish. OS X will recreate what it needs when the operating system starts. Basically, OS X copies the codeFirmware.scap/code file from the boot partition to the EFI  partition.  The files and folders marked below for deletion are not part of OS X.  precodeBOOTLOG                            &lt;---- Delete BOOTLOG.OLD                        &lt;---- Delete screenshot__001.bmp                &lt;---- Delete screenshot__002.bmp                &lt;---- Delete EFI/     APPLE/          CACHES/             CAFEBEEF/                 (empty)         EXTENSIONS/             Firmware.scap         FIRMWARE/             MBP91_00D3_B0D_LOCKED.scap     Ubuntu/                             &lt;---- Delete (Part of Ubuntu)     tools/                              &lt;---- Delete (Part of rEFInd)         gptsync_x64.efi                 &lt;---- Delete (Part of rEFInd)     reFind/                             &lt;---- Delete (Part of rEFInd) /code/pre  The rest of the files were put there by OS X or related software.
