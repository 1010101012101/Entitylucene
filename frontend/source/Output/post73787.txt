`brew doctor` gives warning for newly opened terminal windows <body> When I run codebrew doctor/code I get this warning:  codeWarning: /usr/bin occurs before /usr/local/bin/code  TONS of people with the same problem, but they solve it by running this:  codePATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"/code  Which fixes it once, but upon closing the terminal windows and opening a new one and running codebrew doctor/code, the warning re-appears.  Is there a permanent fix for this?  <answer73790> Edit your codePATH/code variable in your code~/.profile/code (assuming you have not changed your default login shell). There should be something like this:  precodeexport PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin /code/pre  change it so that code/usr/local/bin/code in before code/usr/bin/code.  If you do not have a code~/.profile/code (or it is empty) type the following:  precodeecho 'export PATH=$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.profile, /code/pre  Make certain that you use code&gt;&gt;/code instead of one code&gt;/code.   Now edit the code~/.profile/code like described before.  <comment85741> My .profile file is empty upon entering `sudo nano ~/.profile` <comment85742> added more information @JacksonGariety <comment85743> Thanks! So my .profile now looks like this and it's saved:  `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11/bin`  But it gives me the same error. Is a restart needed here? <comment85744> close and reopen the Teminal <comment85745> That didn't do the trick. It seems brew isn't using the correct path? EDIT: Yeah, if I `echo $PATH` in terminal it shows me a really weird set of paths many which point to `~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/bin` It definitely is not using the `$PATH` from my .profile <comment85750> Shouldn't that file be called `.bash_profile` instead of just `.profile`? <comment85753> It could be in either `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, or `~/.bashrc` already. <comment86884> My `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, and `~/.bashrc` all have some weird jargon referring to `$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm`. The ~/.profile is the file I made and that has the correct PATH settings. Should I copy that into the other 3 files? What PATH is it using? Where is that stored!? <comment86887> Added my path to every single file and `brew doctor` still tells me to change my path. This is infuriating.
