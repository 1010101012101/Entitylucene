Can I share iCloud Drive folder with other iCloud user? <body> I would like to share a folder like Dropbox does, but under codeShare/code I can not find such an option.  <answer151118> No - iCloud drive and its folder structure is strictly for sharing with one account.  For some iWork documents and photos, you can share them individually or by adding someone to a shared photo album, but that's based on the app design and not a more general folder based file sharing idiom.   You could use Apple's MailDrop feature to email each file to the recipient(s) that need to share the file, but it wouldn't be anything that's hosted and really shared in the sense that a change to the file by one user would then be reflected on the cloud.  For that, you would want to set up Server.app on your Mac and simply enable WebDAV file sharing and then you could run your own dropbox at little expense and not a lot of administrative burden to set things up the first time.  <answer154505> Try using OS X Server for Yosemite or Mavericks.  <answer174940> As it currently stands (March 2015) you cannot share iCloud folder, but you can share individual iCloud files. Even if your recipient does't have iCloud account they will be able to view and edit your iCloud documents.   Open a document on your iCloud site, and click share button on the top toolbar. You will be given a link and some options (readonly vs editing, password protection).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d6W68.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer270474> Jan 26 2017, you still can't share folders.   Try using insync.io you can share the folders in your icloud drive without moving the files from their original location. But it will use your google drive storage.  <comment181785> Can you add some details on how using OS X Server would allow sharing of an iCloud Drive folder? <comment228499> What "share" button? <comment228514> @ybakos: added screenshot for Numbers document for example <comment263826> That's not really 'sharing', it's sending them all a copy each <comment263831> At the time I wrote it actually let them edit the document and I was able to see changes. <comment287505> This only seems to work if there is an App, which supports sharing. One cannot share a zip file from the iCloud folder as far as I can see. <comment289404> By iCloud files, sha means iWork files, i.e., files from Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. <comment339967> ok I added my solution <comment350120> Is insync.io aware of how iCloud Drive optimized storage works? If not, it might destroy your data when it encounters ".icloud" files. <comment352354> Essentially makes iCloud useless. <comment360047> Wow, I can't believe I'm paying for iCloud...
