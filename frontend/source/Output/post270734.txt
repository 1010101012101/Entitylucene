Installed docker and ran a container with mongodb, now brew's mongodb isn't working <body> I recently installed docker and ran a container with mongodb, now my local brew's mongodb isn't working.  I am using a mac and originally installed mongodb using homebrew. brew services list now shows the mongodb service as 'running' but in yellow (apparently this means unknown), and I cannot connect using mongochef. This began happening after only once stopping the service brew service stop mongodb, as it was preventing me from using docker with this project: https://meanjs.org/. I stopped the service because there was a conflict for the mongodb port. Now even after destroying all the docker containers, I can't get mongodb working on my machine. I have tried reinstalling mongodb using brew, and stopping and starting the service.  I have also tried deleting the file in /tmp as here: MongoDB Failing to Start - ***aborting after fassert() failure  Any suggestions about where to look and what to do?
