.csv file strange behaviour on my Mac <body> I have this .csv file I created and I am in trouble when I open it on my Mac. Both using excel or a text editor the file has a lot of new lines in the middle of each line, i.e. a single line is split in several ones.  Strange think is that the .csv file is perfectly ok when I open it with the Preview on my Mac or when I open it on a PC  Anybody knows what it's happenig and how I can fix this problem?
