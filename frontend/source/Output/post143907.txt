How to access a connected iPhone device from within Terminal? <body> How can I access the connected iPhone or iPad from within Terminal on OS X? I want to get all the photos (only photos) from the connected iDevice and save it to any directory in my OS X filesystem. I don't want to use the iTunes and instead just want to do it all within Terminal.  I want to get the file path like code/Volumes/my_iphone_name/code, but for some reasons I didn't find anything such in code/Volumes/code subdirectory. Also, codediskutil list/code didn't get me anything that seems related to the connected device.  So where is there my iPhone detected on the entire filesystem?  <comment169533> I don't know how to do this but if you wan to get access to photos and such I use http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/ <comment169535> You can access a jailbroken iPhone through ssh. Is you iPhone jailbroken? Otherwise, it is impossible for now. <comment169536> Thanks. My iPhone is not jailbroken and I don't like to jailbreak it.
