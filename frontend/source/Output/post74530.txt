detect thunderbolt display connection and switch bluetooth accordingly <body> I have a thunderbolt display that I use as a docking station with wireless keyboard and mouse.  Is there a way to turn on bluetooth when connecting the display and turn it off when disconnecting the display?  <answer74541> ControlPlane can do what you want. It's pretty versatile, but you can certainly build a rule that will turn on your Bluetooth when a specific display is attached.  <comment86569> +1 ControlPlane.  Works great.  I use it to turn my BT, open some websites, etc on when I get to work by detecting a specific magsafe adapter and my TB connection. <comment86633> Works great, thanks.
