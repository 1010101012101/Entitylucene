They are best placed to help you remove the software.  By contacting the developers, you will help prompt them to provide better uninstall support.  h2Manually Removing Easy Tether's KEXT/h2  If Mobile Stream are unable to help, you can manually unload the kernel extension using the following command:  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/EasyTetherUSBEthernet.kext /code/pre  Next, find and remove the following file. You will need administrator rights to delete this file:  precode/System/Library/Extensions/EasyTetherUSBEthernet.kext /code/pre  This assumes you installed the EasyTether - Android Tether Solution driver.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tiAAg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment162652> Manually removing files is not without risk, specialty when using the rm -rf, for NOT experienced user. <comment162653> Thanks. I have updated the answer to remove the use of `rm -rf`.
