That said, I should not be immediately worried about the class of error given in your question.  <answer65483> Yes, the error is caused by enabling File Vault only (Lion OS).  Please disable it and check it.  <comment67009> If you upgrade to Mountain Lion, does Disk Utility continue to display the same limitation? <comment67048> Thanks. Good to know. Oddly if I select the HDD (not the volume) using OS X 10.7's Disk Utility, the above error message appeared. Repeating this using OS X 10.8's Disk Utility, and no error message appeared. Selecting the volume to Verify using Disk Utility works on both OS X 10.7 and 10.8. <comment67050> Oddly the same error message does not appear using Disk Utility on OS X 10.8. <comment67054> In Mountain Lion with FileVault 2, in Disk Utility look closely … where you expect to see a physical disk, you may instead find a logical volume group – [the physical disk may be invisible](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58286/8546). <comment67058> In my particular case, I can confirm it's a LVG. <comment76942> I can also relate this error to FileVault. When I disabled FileVault in Mountain Lion, the error disappeared. Upon re-enabling FileVault, the error came back. <comment76943> I see this error when using FileVault in Mountain Lion.
