Getting admin privileges on a mac with almost no access <body> I have a MacBook Air that has single use mode and terminal blocked off and I want to get admin access because with out it I can do absolutely nothing. I thought maybe I could get into it using another computer or something but I have no clue. Does anyone know how I can accomplish this? I am on the brink of giving up so if anyone has any ideas I'm all ears.  <answer290944> There are three avenues:  ul liget the firmware password or bypass that /li lisocially engineer the person or team that locked you out (try convincing them you have a decent need and can be trusted before you consider trying to blatantly deceive them)/li lihope the os or third party software is unpatched and there is a known privilege escalation vulnerability you can exploit. (Assuming you can’t get the NSA or similar to help you)/li /ul  In short, there is no easy way since you’re up against Apple engineering and trying to defeat the security of the system.

Did you set it up originally? <comment367256> no i didnt...sadly <comment367285> Does your Mac support Target Disk Mode? <comment367300> @patrix Firmware password that restricts single user mode also restricts target disk mode and selecting netboot / alternate OS to bring a new admin account to bear. Perhaps the OP can explain how / why single user mode is blocked in case it's not the logical cause of a Firmware password.
