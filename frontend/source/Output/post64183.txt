iMac display -- can't change screen brightness on bootcamp with Windows 7 <body> I can't change iMac (2011) display brightness on bootcamp with Windows 7. When I press F1 it shows icon and even fill the bar, but nothing happen to display.  What have I tried:  ul liReinstalling support files/li liInstalling fresh drivers from ATI site./li liChanging screen brigtness in windows "Power Options"./li /ul  <answer64184> I solved my problem, but I don't actually know what solved it:  ul liI rebooted manualy without any third-party software like strongBootChamp/strong./li liI was pressing kbdAlt/kbd (option) key when booted./li /ul  <answer167333> I just use the brightness keys on the Apple Bluetooth keyboard. But this is the only way that I know to adjust the brightness on my iMac when running Windows 8 bootcamp  <comment197710> I had the same issue, I was rebooting using command line from mac, because my option key was not working. But rebooting using another keyboard via Alt key worked.
