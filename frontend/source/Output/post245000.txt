Before posting it i went through the following proceedure:  ol liKeep your Apple Watch and iPhone close together./li liOpen the Watch app on your iPhone and tap the My Watch tab./li liTap Apple Watch, then tap Unpair Apple Watch./li liEnter your Apple ID password. If you forgot your Apple ID password, you can reset it./li liTap again to confirm./li /ol  If you can't access your iPhone or Apple Watch, or if your Apple Watch isn't paired with your iPhone and you need to turn off Activation Lock:  ol liOn a computer, go to iCloud.com./li liSign in with your Apple ID, and open Settings./li liUnder My Devices, click your Apple Watch./li liClick X next to your device./li liClick Remove to confirm./li /ol  The customer has recently emailed me to inform me that he cannot connect and it is still registered to my Apple ID.  I have checked my Devices on the website and I don't have it registered to my account.
