How do you put back the command key on a Macbook Pro Retina? <body> I haven't found anything for the command key. They loose part is only the actual key, the white plastic thing and the steel bars are already on. I also tried taking out the steel bar and put it on the key, but no matter how I try, I can't get the key to stick. How do I put it on?  <comment310774> I'm pretty sure your keyboard is broken. It would help to tell us what model you have. <comment310784> @IronCraftMan Macbook Pro Retina 15 Inch Early 2013.
