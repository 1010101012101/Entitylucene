Set up iPhone with broken home button <body> I have an iPhone 5S that I restored to factory settings. Now I would like to restore it from an iCloud backup, however because of iOS 10 I either have to press the home button to set it up or set up via iTunes. In iTunes I don't see any of my iCloud backups and only get the option to restore from a local backup.   What do I do?  Update: I can't get to activate Assistive Touch on an erased iPhone before deciding whether I want to set it up as a new one or restore from a backup(from iTunes obviously).  <comment325733> Downgrading to iOS 9 is no longer a viable method as Apple have stopped signing it. Updated the question to explain why the other 2 solutions wouldn't work.
