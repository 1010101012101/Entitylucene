iPhone won't connect to Internet, even when connected to Wi-Fi and 3G <body> I can't access the internet on my iPhone 4, even though it says it's connected to Wi-Fi. It's not a problem with my home Wi-Fi, and my phone also won't connect when it says it's connected to 3G. This happened yesterday, but it went away after a while. It started again at the same time today, but hasn't started working again like it did last time. I tried turning my phone off and on again, but it still doesn't work.  <comment218654> You need to look at your router It sounds like it has lost connection to the internet <comment218668> been connected to WiFi means you only connected to the router, but the router is not giving you access to the internet.
