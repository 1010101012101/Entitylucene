Snow Leopard Server as a Parallels VM <body> Basic question. I have a licensed copy of Snow Leopard Server, and I want to run it in Parallels 8 as a guest OS. Can this be done?  <answer99371> Yes, you can run Snow Leopard and Leopard Server as a guest. You cannot, however, run Leopard or Snow Leopard NON-server OS as a guest, as it is prohibited via Apple's EULA.  EDIT: See Parallels KB here.
