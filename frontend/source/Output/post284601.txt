Switch between "In Library" and "All Apple Music" in iTunes Search <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut or hotkey to switch between the "In Library" tab and "All Apple Music" tab when searching in iTunes? From my research, the only way I see the ability to switch between tabs is by clicking them.   <answer284604> If you enable All Controls in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts, then you can ⇥tab to the button and use space to select it. There does not seem to be a keyboard shortcut for toggling the option directly.
