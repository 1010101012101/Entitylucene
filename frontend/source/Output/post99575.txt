I'm wondering if my 13 inch MacBook Air is having battery issues? <body> This is my current battery information. Could someone please let me know if I need a new battery or what might be wrong with it?  precodeBattery Information:  Model Information:   Serial Number:           D86221701NNDKRNA5   Manufacturer:            SMP   Device Name:               bq20z451   Pack Lot Code:           0   PCB Lot Code:            0   Firmware Version:        406   Hardware Revision:       000a   Cell Revision:           162  Charge Information:   Charge Remaining (mAh):  6098   Fully Charged:           Yes   Charging:                No   Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 6331  Health Information:   Cycle Count:               60   Condition:               Normal   Battery Installed:       Yes   Amperage (mA):           0   Voltage (mV):            8293 /code/pre  <answer99576> The statistics you print look decent for a lightly used, fully charged Air battery. Most of them have voltages between 8.1 and 8.4 V when fully charged.  I don't have recent full charge capacity numbers, but perhaps someone with an other similar Air will post their numbers. Since all batteries have slightly different charge and voltage behavior, you would need to monitor these numbers through several charge cycles (or see how your numbers are changing over time) to tell how the health of the battery is doing.  In reality, there probably are other things you can do to test your battery (like how long it takes to charge or how long it will run while awake and lightly loaded) and you will need to have a service technician run Apple's battery tests to tell if your snapshot numbers are within our out of spec.  <answer99683> I would recommend using coconutBattery to monitor your battery life and record degradation statistics. For example, my MacbookPro is 21 months old, 142 cycles and has 94% of original capacity (6519 out of 6900). But Pro batteries are different from Airs, they degrade slower.  Here you can see how Air battery degrades over a year (recorded daily). Yours does not look different.  <comment117156> If you add your Mac's model year (Mid 2010) or such, perhaps someone with one will post their FCC numbers for you to compare. <comment117158> What makes you think you have battery issues in the first place?
