I know we can detect our iPhone when we login on iCloud website with same apple id as device login but what if device logout from that apple id. can we still detect our iPhone ?  <answer130684> You cannot logout iCloud without entering the password if strongFind My iPhone/strong is enabled. At least, this counts for iOS7.  With versions prior iOS 7 you can wipe the device without having the password.   <comment153304> ok thanks for detail :)
