How to control AirPort wireless radio from the command line? <body> I want to know how to control (specifically turn off) the networking (specifically AirPort - I want to turn off the radio) from the command line (specifically from bash in Terminal.app, being run by me) as a user (no sudo privileges or admin priviliges). You CAN turn off AirPort as a user, but I need to do this from the command line &ndash; as a user.  <answer46907> See OSX Daily - Enable and Disable AirPort Wireless from the Command Line in Mac OS X.  Quote:     strongTurn Airport Off via Command Line/strongbr   codenetworksetup -setairportpower airport off/code      strongTurn Airport On via Command Line/strongbr   codenetworksetup -setairportpower airport on/code      You wonâ€™t see any confirmation in the Terminal that the command   succeeded or failed, but if you watch the AirPort menu icon you will   see the bars disappear indicating the wireless interface is turned   off, or reappear indicating that wireless is activated again.   strongNOTE:/strong In OS X Lion, use the hardware name above instead of codeairport/code,br e.g. codenetworksetup -setairportpower en1 off/code.  <comment53690> This a great answer, but you should specify that they need to replace `airport` with the network adapter name their computer uses. For my MacBook Pro, it's `en1`. <comment53697> Great point.  The article I quoted to even had a similar comment. <comment53704> Thank you! This was very helpful, a friend of mine is on a computer where when you try to change airport to off it pops something up for the admin password. This seemed easier than fixing that - now he has two workflows for connecting automatically to various networks at times of the day and stuff like that. <comment83677> Beware that it is not always `en1`. To find out what it is on your computer, you can use either `networksetup -listallhardwareports` or `ifconfig`.
