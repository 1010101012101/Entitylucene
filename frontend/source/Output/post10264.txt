Making changes to a Smart Group's distribution list persistent <body> Is there a way to make changes to a Smart Group's distribution list persistent?  h2Problem Description/h2  In Address Book, I right-click on a Smart Group and select "Edit Distribution List".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7BccN.png" alt="Smart Group in Address Book"  I then select a work address for a contact that has multiple email addresses.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mOko.png" alt="Edit Distribution List"  If I close the the "Edit Distribution List" menu and then go back into it, my change from home/other to work for that particular user did not persist.  The problem is that when I send an email using a smart group, I cannot ensure that everyone will receive the email to their work email address.  Any thoughts?  <answer40959> Distribution lists are not persisted for smart groups. On Lion, if you search Address Book help for "distribution list", you will see a page called "Select addresses for group members". Below step 2 is this piece of bad news: "You can't choose smart groups."  Some versions of OS X show smart groups in the codeEdit Distribution List/code window, but as of Lion, this is simply the user interface being misleading.  Speaking of Lion, users who use iCloud for contacts will see the codeEdit Distribution List/code menu item disabled, because this feature is not yet available with iCloud.  <comment10713> For what is worth, I experience the same behavior. <comment10821> It's weird, look at this: http://www.macworld.com/article/158580/2011/03/groupsmailaddresses.html
