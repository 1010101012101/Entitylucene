How do I reference a file in an Automator app where I wish to "open with..." the app? <body> I want to create a simple automator script foo.app which will transform a particular type of file. I would like the script to exist as an app, such that when I ask the Finder service to "open with...  foo.app" it will take the file, transform it, open it, and then close out.  I want to handle the transform with a shell script, but I don't know how to pass the opened file to the shell script. Is this possible?  <comment309957> Yes it is possible. You need to pass the file path from Automator to your script. Not sure if "open with" is possible via an Automator app but I may be wrong.
