Routing traffic internally from Ethernet-Thunderbolt adapter to Ethernet <body> I have  Mac1 connected via ethernet to a router. The Mac1 has the IP 10.0.1.5 On this IP I have a Python-server listening to incoming UDP packets.  Now there is another Mac2 connected to Mac1 via a Thunderbolt-Ethernet Adapter. The IP of Mac1 on this adapter is 192.168.20.1 Mac2 sends UPD packets to this address.  How can i route this traffic internally on Mac1 from  192.168.20.1 to 10.0.1.5?  Both machines are on MacOS 10.10  Thanks a lot!  <answer180225> There is no need to route anything. Just let the python-server also listen to incoming UDP packets at eth2 (192.168.20.1) assuming eth2 is the TB-Ethernet interface.
