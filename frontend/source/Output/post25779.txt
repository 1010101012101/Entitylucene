On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup? <body> In addition to whatever files I may choose to exclude, what files does the system exclude by rule or classification?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NCn12.png" alt="enter image description here"  It might make sense not to backup Trash or Caches, but I'm looking for a way to tell what files are skipped "behind the scenes." Knowing if the system maintains an exclusion list or exclusion pattern would be very helpful in managing larger groups of macs.  <answer25819> You'll probably find this useful - http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080328025026826  Specifically:  sudo mdfind "com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'"  Will return what is being ignored. Apps can tell TM to ignore certain files.  <answer25828> By default, Apple Time Machine does not back up:  ul liSystem log files/li liSpotlight indexes/li liCache files of any type/li liFiles in the Trash (or any other user's Trash)/li liTemporary files/li liSpecific application data that an app may flag for Time Machine to not back up/li /ul  This applies to all versions of Mac OS X which have Time Machine.

Peachpit Press.  <answer25833> There's a built-in list of exclusions stored in code/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist/code. It's a bit too long to paste here comfortably, so I've posted a copy StdExclusions.plist (10.7.1) on Pastebin. There also is StdExclusions.plist (10.6.8 Server) on Pastebin.  Some of the more obvious user file exclusions are Trash, Document revisions and MobileBackups from the local Time Machine store are all excluded. The rest of the exclusions are for system things like caches and databases that exist to index other files where the system can regenerate these databases after a restore.  In addition, apps can use a file's metadata to exclude a file from backups. You can view this list of files by running the command:  precodesudo mdfind "com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'" /code/pre  On my system this outputs the following:  precode/Users/brant/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache /Users/brant/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml /Users/brant/Library/iTunes/iPod Software Updates /Users/brant/Library/iTunes/iPad Software Updates /Users/brant/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates /Users/brant/Pictures/iPod Photo Cache /Volumes/Archive/brant/Pictures/iPhoto Library/iPod Photo Cache /Volumes/Archive/brant/Pictures/iPhoto Library/AlbumData.xml /Users/brant/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Safe Browsing Csd Whitelist /Users/brant/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Safe Browsing Bloom /Users/brant/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Safe Browsing Bloom Filter 2 /Users/brant/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Safe Browsing Download /Users/brant/Documents/Virtual Machines/Visual Studio.pvm/{ae6f7518-762e-4fcd-b166-c7a914fc237f}.mem /Users/brant/Music/iTunes/Album Artwork/Cache /Users/brant/Library/Saved Application State /Users/brant/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History-journal /Users/brant/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Favicons-journal /Users/brant/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Favicons /Users/brant/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History /Users/brant/Library/Icons/WebpageIcons.db /Users/brant/Library/Safari/WebpageIcons.db /code/pre  As you can see, there are a few files here which various apps have told Time Machine not to bother with. Furthermore, on Lion, the tmutil command allows you to query, set, and delete file exclusions from the command line:  ul licodetmutil isexcluded _item_/code will determine if the volume, directory or file is currently excluded./li licodetmutil addexclusion _item_/code sets an exclusion rule so that the item (even if moved to a new location or renamed) will be excluded from future backups./li licodetmutil addexclusion -p _item_/code sets an exclusion rule so that the item path is excluded. This remains unchanged so if the file moves it will be backed up if not at this exact path and also will prevent backing up a file if it comes back in the same location as the rule specifies./li licodetmutil removeexclusion _item_/code removed either type of exclusion rule as appropriate./li /ul  <answer69214> The root folders of snapshots also have a property list with folders that were excluded from the snapshot.  precodesudo defaults read /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/*/Latest/.exclusions.plist /code/pre  My latest snapshot included the folders in codeStdExclusions.plist/code and the folders excluded in Time Machine's preferences. It didn't include files or folders that just had the codecom.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem/code extended attribute.  <answer229631> If you want to check for the presence of the extended attribute codecom.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem/code on a specific file/directory you can use the codexattr/code command:  precodexattr path_to_file_name /code/pre  Or the codemdls/code command (which will also show you the metadata attributes):  precodemdls path_to_file_name /code/pre  But the best way to check if a file/dir is excluded from backup is to use codetmutil/code, as suggested above, since it also checks whether it is on any exclusion list:  precodetmutil isexcluded path_to_file_name /code/pre  <comment29344> That mdfind query is _gold_ - thanks! <comment30030> Dustin, answers that are no more than links are not good answers. When a link answers the question, it is important not only to cite the source, but to quote relevant details.  Sites go down, urls change, etc. <comment80397> ~/Library/Caches/ and ~/Library/Logs/ are excluded from backups, but they still include some cache and log files in folders like /var/db/ and /var/log/. <comment80463> Wow - I better poke at this a bit. Mountain Lion has changed how exclusions are handled when you add them back to the backup set. No longer are folders incrementally backed in this case, instead a full backup of the files happens the next backup covering that file. <comment84105> I would love to upvote you multiple times for this answer :-) <comment160051> Yeah seriously, if I could offer a 200-point retroactive bounty, I would.  Awesome answer.
