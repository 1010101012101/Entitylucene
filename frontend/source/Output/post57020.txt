Is there any way to set Gmail app as the default mail client in iPhone and iPad? <body> I want to be able to one-click email links from apps such as Twitter, Safari and Instapaper. Is this possible if I'm using Gmail and not Apple's Mail app?  Do I have to set Gmail as the default mail client? Is this possible?  <answer57024> To give a very short answer: strongNo/strong, this is not possible.  <answer74791> This doesn't appear possible.  In order to utilize email functionalities from within apps, you will have to enable the Apple Mail app. I recommend turning off all notifications for Mail if you want to use the Gmail app as your primary iPhone mail client.  <answer82672> I do have a jailbroken iPhone 4s and unfortunately I cannot find any app to add this much desired functionality in any Cydia repository.  So at the moment I'd say it is not possible.  <answer104438> This is a nice workaround, it may be a good solution:br Can I use gmail as default client for sharing photos from camera roll or links from safari?  <answer104654> It works if you are using the Gmail app and Chrome browser (i.e. when clicking on the mail icon in a NY Times story you are browsing in Chrome), but I don't think you can enable it by default in other apps.  <answer238697> I just added outlook to the apps when sending from Safari and it now appears as an option. Not quite default but good enough  <comment86869> Is this still true? <comment86870> Also, is there any way to get around this? ie, a workaround so you can "mail links" directly from ios 6 apps such as Twitter, Safari, NYTimes, etc? <comment86895> I'm pretty sure this would be possible with a jailbreak. I am almost to the point of jailbreaking for this feature... <comment108377> [Sparrow+](http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=sparrowplusDp) claims that it can change the default mail app. So technically that is possible.
