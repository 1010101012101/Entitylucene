Google history of Apple iPhone 6s appears on PC? <body> Why would someones iPhone Google history, appear in my Google history on my PC? Has this person synced our Google accounts or something?   <comment318957> When you say "iPhone Google history", do you mean search history under https://myactivity.google.com? <comment318958> Somebody who's sitting next to me just looked up, let's say "Labradors", on their iPhone's Google app. I'm on my PC, and I've gone into my Google history, and low and behold "Labradors" appears in my Google history, and I have never googled "Labradors"! This occurred with a number of websites this person looked up on the iPhone! <comment318959> The only way that's possible is for the Google app on that device to be signed into your Google account. <comment318961> I guess that way, this person can also see everything that I Google on my device??!! How do I sign out of all devices, then change passwords...etc <comment318962> Well, realizing this is really only tangentially related to Apple products, I'm not going to post this as an answer, but I'd start at https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount?ft=2&continue=https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity?pli%3D1 <comment318988> Are you connected through the same router or through the same Wi-Fi access point? Is your PC connected on the Wi-Fi network provided by this neighbour iPhone?
