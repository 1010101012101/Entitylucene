Is this output of diskutil list normal? <body> I just installed and uninstalled Windows using Bootcamp. Now that I look at the output of diskutil list:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            250.1 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +249.8 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  E676E8C7-E3F3-4599-9F9F-7D4EDA02160A                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  I don't remember Macintosh HD being on a virtual disk earlier. Is this normal or did I break something?  <comment314104> Well, you are using Core Storage. This is why you see a virtual drive. Since you are not using encryption and do not have a Fusion drive, you do not have to use Core Storage. Other than that, everything looks OK. <comment314107> @DavidAnderson ah okay, thanks :) <comment314153> Recent versions of the OS X installer (since Yosemite IIRC) set up Core Storage automatically, just in case you want to use FileVault encryption. You can turn it off if you want, but it doesn't really matter.
