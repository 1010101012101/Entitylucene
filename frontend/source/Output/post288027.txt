Adobe Acrobat crashing because of too many checkbox fields? <body> I'm creating an interactive PDF using InDesign, then exporting to PDF and finishing the form in Acrobat. I've made a bunch of them before, with little to no crashing. But everytime I try to go into Form Edit mode and make some changes, Acrobat is crashing. Not just on one computer, because I tested the form on another computer. I read on Adobe Forums (which usually aren't that much help) that this might be because of checkbox and radio button fields, which this particular form has a lot of. But I've used radio buttons before with no issues, so could it be check boxes? Which seems insane, and might mean I had to re-set the document. Has anyone had anything similar happen and found a solution? Not 100% this is a "Mac" question.
