Why does Finder interact so slowly with NAS? <body> I have a strongSynology NAS D213+/strong.  When I want to connect the NAS to my Mac, Finder mounts a new volume which behaves like a normal partition.   But it interacts so slowly - I click on a folder, and it takes a huge number of seconds till it's open. Explorer on Windows is much faster when it comes to network interaction.   What can I do? Change the protocol? It must be AFP, so do I have to change the protocol elsewhere in the kernel?   <answer95427> My advice would be to use NFS. You should also try to manually mount the partition from the terminal, so you can add some options too, like  precode  -nolock,locallocks,rdirplus /code/pre  This made my browsing much faster, even over wifi.   Cheers  <comment87375> I have this same NAS and have noticed FINDER is slow but using ForkLift seems much faster to browse folders and files. <comment94275> I'm using a DS411j running DSM4.1. Like you, it's noticeably slower with Mountain Lion (though it wasn't exactly blazing fast with Lion).  I suspected it had to do with versions support in ML, so what I did was to run tmidiagnose and reported the results back to Apple. <comment106901> You should be able to export the file system as SMB and mount it that way on the Mac.  This often has better performance than with non-apple implementations of AFP
