Can I get the location of my stolen iPad mini 2 with serial number? <body> My friend's iPad Air is iOS 7.1 so the Find My iPhone app can't be installed. How can I find my iPad mini 2 stolen? Can I find with the device's serial number?  <answer199956> Not with the serial number. If you have access to a web browser, you can go to iCloud.com and find your device through Find My iPhone on there.
