EPUB files are not syncing through iCloud for iBooks along with iOS 9.3 <body> Since 21 March 2016, I am able to sync any books via icloud between devices. It works pretty good for pdf. But it doesnt work for strongEPUB/strong files. I have downloaded for my iPhone some strongEPUB/strong file from the website and saved to iBooks, but it didn't appear on my another device, while the pdf did appear.   What is wrong?  <answer232309> In iOS iBooks try tapping the "Collections" selector top center of the app below the system time and turning OFF "Hide iCloud Books".  <answer233348> OK, I actually did the OPPOSITE and it worked -- Turned ON "Hide iCloud Books" and restarted the app and suddenly everything was synced up.  <comment284141> Amazing, it really works:)
