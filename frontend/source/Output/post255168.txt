WebTorrent steals magnet association even when not running <body> For torrents (macOS 10.11), I mostly use Transmission, and occasionally WebTorrent when I want to stream something. Transmission has a button to associate it with magnet links. WebTorrent doesn't really have an option for that, but seems to associate magnet links whenever it runs, which is annoying but wouldn't be an insurmountable problem since I use it rarely.  However, WebTorrent manages to steal my magnet association for Firefox/Chrome emeven when it is not running/em. I use Transmission's button to get the magnet association, and it works for a few seconds. However, after that short period of time, WebTorrent seems to have the association again. How can a program steal association even when it isn't running?  <comment317760> It might have a helper daemon open right now. Try looking at your startup items.
