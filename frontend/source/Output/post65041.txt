Can I use automator to launch a keystroke when program is idle <body> Can I use automator to launch a keystroke (cmd+R) when program PremierePro CS6 is idle for 1 minute. This keystroke would start program to Render videofiles. Many Thanks, Jan.  <answer65054> I don't know how well it would work, but you could try running something like this in AppleScript Editor.  precoderepeat     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Safari"         set p to properties of UI elements of UI elements         delay 10         if properties of UI elements of UI elements is p then             set frontmost to true             keystroke "r" using command down             --return             delay 20         end if     end tell end repeat /code/pre  <comment76487> Hey, many thanks, it works almost perfect. Now it puts the process upfront after a delay of 10 seconds, can this be changed in : after "inactivity" of 10 seconds ? <comment76489> or after 1minute of "keyboard inactivity" ? <comment76491> I don't know any way to really see if an application hasn't been used. `properties of UI elements of UI elements` just checks if properties like the positions of windows have been changed. <comment76512> no problem, many thans, anyway. <comment76513> one last question, I tried to add a "keystroke" cmd+h to hide the program after it did cmd+r. but it seems only to do cmd+h.any idea what i did wrong ? <comment76527> I made a mistake, it works fine now. Many thanks for your help! <comment78427> You might get better answers if you don't restrict the solution space to Automator.
