How do I see what's been changed in a shared notebook in OneNote for Mac? <body> I use OneNote for Mac, and my friend uses OneNote for Windows. I shared a notebook with him, and when I change things, the associated page titles in the right-hand list become bold. I can't seem to achieve the same experience with OneNote for Mac when he changes things in the notebook. Is this an omitted feature?
