Rearrange styles in the Microsoft Word Quick Style Gallery <body> Is there any way to re-arrange the order of the styles in Microsoft Word's Quick Style Gallery?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YS7e4.png" alt="screenshot of quick style gallery"  <answer249997> It's currently not possible to change the priority level of a style in Word 2016 on OS X. The priority level is set based on how styles inherit from other styles and at the moment can't be set directly.  <comment310252> and the priority level determines where it appears in the UI? <comment310257> @vy32 Apologies, I presumed you were familiar with changing the order of the styles in Word on Windows. In Windows, you can [override a style's priority](http://i.stack.imgur.com/65Qa0.png) which defines where it is positioned in the list. In OS X, it's currently not possible to manually override a style's priority.
