Wallpaper that I download <body> How can I save a downloaded image to the folder called pictures that I see in System Preferences/Desktop &amp; Screen Saver/Desktop? I'm assuming that this is a good place to store images that I download for wallpaper. Thanks Gary  <answer126664> Push the code+/code at the bottom of the list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bpsno.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then select a folder or create a new one in your home folder, perhaps inside your Pictures folder.   There may be a way to put a picture inside the Apple desktop pictures folders, but this is the more standard way to go about it.
