Any way to improve text using 11" MacBook Air 2nd display scaled to 1920x1080? <body> I have an 11" mid-2012 macBook Air and am using a 2nd display through my Thunderbolt port with an HDMI converter. The external Samsung monitor is nothing special but it accommodates a 1920x1080 picture. When I use the kbdoption/kbd + Scaling menu in the System Preferences  Display to select 1080p I am assuming this is displaying an actual 1920x1080 signal and not just stretching 1366x768 to fill the larger aspect ratio?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9dPyO.png" alt="enter image description here"  I ask because in all of the options larger than 1366x768 text does not look very good (aliasing, jaggy edges, soft edges, etc.):    Default 1366x768:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGzVw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Scaled 1080p (the screen capture, of course, looks fine, so I took a picture, which softens it somewhat, though you can see the aliasing):    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JdvTs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Reading text like this after a while gives me a headache.  Also, for example, reading a web page in Safari I can magnify the view (kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbd+/kbd) and the text is still awkward but not as painful to look at, of course, then I also lose the real estate I gained with the larger aspect ration.    That said, em1920x1080 HD video/em does look better using the scaling option (as opposed to configuring the 2nd monitor using the "Default for display" of 1366x768.) The 2nd monitor is already a big leg up when working with multiple text apps, IDE's, web pages and such at the same time, but is there a better way to maximize the screen real estate and preserve the text quality?
