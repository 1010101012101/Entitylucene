How can I take a screenshot from all monitors with screencapture or other tools? <body> I wanted to use codescreencapture/code to take a screenshot of all monitors from within a script, but this only seems to capture the main monitor. How can I use codescreencapture/code or any other tool callable from the command line to capture all monitors?  <answer113475> It's poorly documented, but it is indeed possible with the codescreencapture/code command.  precodescreencapture ~/Desktop/screen1.png ~/Desktop/screen2.png [...] /code/pre  Here's the relevant section from codeman screencapture/code:  precode files   where to save the screen capture, 1 file per screen /code/pre  Of course, if you're calling it programmatically, you might not know how many monitors there are, so you'll have to parse the output of codesystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType/code or codedefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist/code to determine how many filename arguments to pass to codescreencapture/code. For example:  precode$ system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep "Online: Yes" | wc -l        2 /code/pre  strongReferences/strong    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20099333/terminal-command-to-show-connected-displays-monitors-resolutionsbr http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?p=695603  <comment133143> I've edited your question to keep it (and potential answers) within the scope as defined in the [FAQ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic). <comment133158> thanks.
