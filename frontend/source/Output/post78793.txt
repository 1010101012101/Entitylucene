Apple Script + VPN + Textbox <body> I have an applescript :  precodetell application "System Events"     tell current location of network preferences         set VPNService to service "VPN (Cisco IPSec)"         if exists VPNService then             connect VPNService         end if     end tell end tell /code/pre  When I execute it a dialog box is showing up and ask me for my password. I would like to automate this process and put directly my password in my script and validate automatically the dialog box.  Is there a way a to do that ?  <answer79125> Here is a simple solution.   precodetell application "System Events"     tell current location of network preferences         set VPNService to service "UJF"         if exists VPNService then             connect VPNService         end if     end tell     delay 1     keystroke "yourpassword" end tell /code/pre  If 1 second delay isn't enough for the popop to open feel free to increase it !   But don't forget, a password *should* NEVER be stored like that.
