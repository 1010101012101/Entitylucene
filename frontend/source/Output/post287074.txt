How can I create Todoist tasks with Siri? <body> I recently started using Todoist as the primary reminder/task management app on my iPhone. However, one feature I miss from Apple's native Reminders app is being able to create reminders using Siri commands. (ie: "emRemind me to buy groceries tomorrow/em")  strongIs it possible to create Todoist reminders using Siri? Or is Siri only able to interact with Apple's native Reminders app?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/APahW.png" alt="Apple reminders with Siri"  <answer287091> For now this feature is only available for Reminders.  In iOS 11 it's possible for todo list apps to use Siri. So you need to wait for iOS 11 and for the developer of Todoist to update it's app to add support for Siri.     SiriKit gives developers the ability to integrate Siri into their   apps, and with iOS 11 it expands to support more categories, including   strongto-do lists/strong, notes and reminders; banking for account transfers and   balances; and apps that display QR codes.   emSource: look for SiriKit/em  <comment362451> You should include the relevant quote from the linked source in your answer.
