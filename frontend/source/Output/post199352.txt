What gets synced if I enable iCloud syncing for Safari but not passbook <body> In my iCloud settings on the iPhone 6, I've selected Safari and deselected Keychain. Which of the following Safari data gets synced via iCloud?  ol liBrowsing history/li liBookmarks/li liOpen tabs/li liAutofill data/li liPasswords/li liCredit cards/li liSafari settings/li /ol  Am I correct in understanding that 1-4 are controlled by the "Safari" option in iCloud, 5 and 6 are controlled by the "iCloud Keychain" option, and 7 is not supported at all?  I'd like everything but (5) synced. Am I correct in understanding that that's not possible?  References: iCloud Tabs, Bookmarks and Reading List, iCloud Keychain.
