"Connect to Server" option missing <body> Running OSX Lion, I have no "connect to server" option listed in Finder  Go menu. Everything I've read about connecting to a Windows file share references that option. Why would it be missing and where did it go? I am trying to connect to a SMB share at work from my personal laptop, so there is no corporate policy file disabling that option on it. The network admin knows of no reason why it would be missing.  I hope someone can help with this.  <answer53626> Make sure that you have Finder in focus and hit "Command K" and you should get the connect to server window.  <answer53700> Chad, Thanks for the link. Petrock had the solution. Here it is:  I used the free Pref Setter app to edit the plist file.     You probably used one of those "set hidden finder features"   apps/utils, didn't you... naughty person you is... If you open up   ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist with Property List Editor   and see an entry for "ProhibitConnectTo", then thats the problem. Set   it to false and save the changes. Then Control-Option-Click on the   Finder icon in the dock and select Relaunch. When the Finder comes   back up, Connect To should be available again.   <answer206859> I have the same issue as you, no "Connect to server..." from Go menu, and Cmd-K also not work.   But I accidently right-click on Finder icon on Dock and see "Connect to server..." option from there. It works for me!  <comment61329> Did you already reboot your mac? And create a new account und log in as the new user for once (to see whether it's a general problem or just with your account). <comment61367> No, I have not tried that, yet. I will, though. Thanks. <comment61369> I'm quite sure finder has focus. cmd-k does nothing. <comment61371> Are you running Onyx on your Mac? A posting here: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1196874 indicates that this may be a problem. <comment61372> I just tried your suggestion. Same result. No "Connect to Server" option. Test account had admin privs. <comment61378> I don't know what Onyx is, so most likely, "no". <comment61386> Note that command will bring up the "Connect to Server" window not fix the drop down menu to have the option listed in there again. I can't confirm for certain since I'm on my work Windows machine but this link will also prove what I say is true: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343 <comment61394> Hmm this might have been a more complicated problem than I frist thought try some of the suggestions in this disscussion, espically the last one. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1735862?start=0&tstart=0 <comment61448> I'm not implying that what you say isn't true. Merely stating a fact that cmd-k does nothing. <comment61565> `defaults delete com.apple.finder ProhibitConnectTo` would have the same effect.
