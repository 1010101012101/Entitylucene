Why homebrew doesn't set environment variables? <body> Why is there no code$JAVA_HOME/code after codebrew cask install java/code, and no code$CATALINA_HOME/code after codebrew install tomcat/code.   ol liWhy?/li liDoes Homebrew always ignore environment variables even though they are required for proper installation?/li /ol  <answer273901> In my experience, homebrew generally installs things into locations that are already in the PATH. At least that seems to be the default. For the Java, cask is a repackage of Java, I'd use the official installer if I were you. For the other package, I'm not familiar with it, but I'm pretty sure homebrew packages define scripts to run after installation. Whoever maintains that homebrew package should make sure their install scripts properly modify .bashrc or .bash_profile or .profile as appropriate.   You should also verify that if those files exist in your home folder, they are being used. Check them, perhaps the installer added the right path variables to a file that isn't used.   I'm a little rusty on the difference between .profile and .bash_profile and .bashrc whatnot but I remember that one of them may not get loaded unless another specifically loads it.   <comment344310> Where would Homebrew set them? Also java is not installed by homebrew but from Oracle or Apple <comment344324> What if your shell is tcsh or zsh? <comment344325> @fd0 you'll have to check out your shell's documentation and the brew documentation. It's possible that if brew defined the path modifications in one of the bash specific config files that those changes wouldn't apply to your shell. In that case, look through them (.bashrc or .bash_profile) and if the path changes are there, move them to where they belong in your specific shell's profile or config files <comment344417> "Why" questions should probably be asked on the Homebrow support site/forum. If you need specific input on getting things to work on your Mac, please rephrase and focus your question on the actual problem you need to solve.
