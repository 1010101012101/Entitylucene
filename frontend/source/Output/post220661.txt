Connect MacBook Pro 2015 to iMac 2015 with HDMI? <body> I forgot to bring my "Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt" cable to connect my MacBook Pro to my iMac screen. I do not wish to spend again all that money to go buy one now.  The only thing I have here is a "HDMI to HDMI" cable and there is a possibility for me to go buy an "HDMI to Mini DisplayPort" which are cheap.  I would like to know if connecting the HDMI strongfrom/strong my MacBook and using the adapter to connect to the Thunderbolt of my iMac will work.   <answer220664> Target Display Mode needs DisplayPort or Thunderbolt. It cannot use HDMI.

Not sure I'd risk it.
