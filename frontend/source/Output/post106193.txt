keynote 3D image transformation <body> I'm trying to produce an effect like shown on Apple's iOS7 website. First you see an image which actually consist of different layers. Then I want to animate the image to turn by 45 degrees and separate the layers so that they become visible like in the image below. Is this possible in Keynote or do I have to use a more advanced program for 3D animation?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXhHm.jpg" alt="iPhone 5S display layers exploded"  <comment360314> Your question is confusing; Keynote is not a motion graphics software. The presentations during which Apple unveils their products are called "Keynote" but it doesn't relate to the software they make called Keynote. You could easily reproduce the image you posted in a Keynote slideshow with a transparent PNG or even by screen grabbing the animation and importing it as a movie within Keynote.
