How do I delete events in my iPhone calendar posted by Apple <body> Apple puts events in my Calendar like "Flag Day"  Is there a way to delete such events?  When I see a "dot" on a date, and go check what it is, it's a waste of my time if it isn't an event that I've posted. Really annoying.  <answer271720> You can disable unwanted calendars in Calendar.app on iPhone with these steps:  ol listrongopen Calendar.app/strong in your iPhone/li liHold your iPhone vertical/li liOn the strongbottom are three buttons/strong visible: Today, strongCalendars/strong, Inbox if you don't see them, go back to the monthly overview)/li liTap "strongCalendars"  Hide All Calendars/strong/li liNow select strongonly the calendars you want/strong to see./li liTap "strongDone/strong" when you're done./li /ol  Let me know if this works for you.  <comment344003> Yes!  that worked.
