Can I make all viewable windows active (responsive to mouse clicks)? <body> For example, if I have 2 monitors and 3 opened browser windows, and I want to click a link on inactive window I have to click 2 timesâ€”first to activate a window and the second time to click a link.  Is there a way to make all viewable windows active so that they respond immediately to mouse clicks without having to be focused first?  I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.
