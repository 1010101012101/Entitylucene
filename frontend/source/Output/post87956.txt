Macbook Air 1,1 power consumption <body> I have the original MBA, and I have extremely high power consumption - see the screenshot (screenshot got while TextEdit only was running) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcRY4.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is is normal for original MBA?  <answer87960> That is on the high site with 1400.  My MBA-13 consumes 1100 without TextEdit and 1200 with.  I do have Chrome and Friefox ect. running.  You might have some background stuff running, so check your Activity monitor and see who is using CPU.  Disable your network or wifi.  <comment102926> No, I have 95% CPU idle. I just runned my MBA and got 1880, but now I have 1331. Is there any methods to reduce this power consumption? <comment102929> Just to compare, I have 98% idle, no programs running from user (other than system information), my power drain is (-) 1000 mAh. So that is the lowest my MBA can do with 100% screen. But i noticed you have new battery! <comment102953> Yeah, just replaced it. But my MBA works only for 3 or 3.5 houts, and this is sad
