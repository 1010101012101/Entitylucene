Persistent do not disturb toggle in Yosemite possible? <body> When Do Not Disturb is on it shows in Notification Center. When it's off, no toggle.  I just want it there all the time so I can flick it on while I focus for an hour or so.  Anyone know how to make that happen?  <answer153706> Scroll up the Notification Center to reveal the switch.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKAYk.gif" alt=""  <answer154563> You may notice that the notification center icon is greyed out when DND is active. You can also option + click the notification center icon to toggle DND on/off.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/eVSqZqx.gif" alt=""  <answer199388> You can also ENABLE the keyboard shortcut for it.  To do so go to the syst pref keyboard shortcuts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QklSs.jpg" alt="on/off"
