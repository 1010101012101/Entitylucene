iTunes crashes quickly after opening, every time <body> I'm running iTunes 12.6.0.100 and MacOS 10.2.3 on a late 2015 iMac. Every time I open iTunes, whether with a brand new local library or an external drive library I've had for several years, the app crashes. It doesn't throw an error or anything, it just closes. I've tried, of course, opening it without a library to create a new one, and also booting in safe mode. Neither of these have helped. I've also tried reinstalling iTunes itself.  I do have iTunes Match on my account, but am not an Apple Music user.  I read somewhere that I could try clearing out the iBooks library, and so I tried this. At first I thought it might be helping, as it took a little while for it to crash, but it still crashed. There does seem to be some inconsistency in how long it takes to crash when it opens, but this doesn't appear to be related to anything I do differently.  What might be happening, and what additional things could I try?
