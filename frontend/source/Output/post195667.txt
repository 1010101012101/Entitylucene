Import OS X Folders into Photos.app on mac <body> Does anyone know to import OS X folders into Photos.app albums? Every time I drag a folder in photos.app, it doesn't automatically generate an album for that folder. Is there a way to force this functionality?  <answer195692> There's an indirect way of copying those photos into the desired album.  That's by dragging that folder into photos.app as usual, then opening Last Import album to select those photos and adding them to the desired album ('+' button  Album).  <comment233722> Thanks - I knew about this solution, but I wanted to do a massive drag-n-drop of folders, not 1 by 1.
