iPhone turns itself off with lots of charge left <body> My iPhone turns itself off when it has lots of battery charge left, sometimes 70% then I cant turn it on at all unless I plug it in to a charger....then the apple logo appears and it turns on as normal with lots of charge?  <answer192981> It appears your battery is faulty.  If you have an iPhone 5, check the iPhone 5 Battery Replacement Program to get a free replacement.  If your phone is under warranty or AppleCare extended warranty, go to the Apple Support webpage, "Start a service request" and fill in your problem details so Apple can help you.  If you have a Mac, you can find information about your battery by plugging into your computer and installing the free CoconutBattery app to check its health.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ACdkB.png" alt="CoconutBattery showing iPhone 5"  <comment229829> What model is your iPhone? I had an iPhone 5 with faulty battery doing the same; Apple replaced those for free. <comment229833> It is a 3G so quite old but has just started doing it. <comment229834> Maybe you should think about replacing the battery. <comment229836> Ok.  Maybe that is the issue.  But it holds charge?  I don't know. Maybe I should go see an apple retailer... <comment229839> Ok thank you.  I will look into it.
