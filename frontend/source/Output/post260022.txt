Camera changing on Mac <body> How can I change my camera on Google Hangouts? I have a macbookpro computer. I can't control the settings on the Facetime camera. I would like to change the camera to either photobooth, or webcam.   <comment325414> By ‘webcam’ do you mean you've connected an additional webcam to your computer, using USB for example? You can't change the camera to Photo Booth because that's an app, not a camera.
