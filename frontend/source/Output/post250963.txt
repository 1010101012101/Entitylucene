Which x10 home automation controllers, if any, don't require additional device drivers? <body> I wish to run an x10 home automation controller on my 15.6.0 Darwin Mac mini, via a USB port. Which x10 controllers, if any, have USB hardware that works without installing additional drivers.   Alternatively I may be able to replace just the USB to serial dongle on an x10 controller I already have. Is there a USB to 4 wire serial dongle, that again has native support? Bonus points for having an RJ11 connector.  As I am sure I will be asked, I don't wish to install device drivers because 1) future OS upgrades may cause the USB driver to stop being supported 2) I don't trust running 3rd party device drivers.
