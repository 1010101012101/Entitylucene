Moving the cursor using the touchpad inserts "C" <body> This problem happens when I use Parallels (Windows) and Beyond Compare. When I move the mouse using the touchpad, it will automatically insert kbdC/kbd in any place that can input characters.  My OS X is 10.10.5.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8hg6.gif" alt="enter image description here"  strongUpdate 2015-12-29/strong I find when I move the cursor, the codeEdit/code will shines, also I imagine kbdC/kbd related to copy. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MhgEM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer231672> After three months, I finally found reason. The codeEudic/code I installed has function called codeZoned word translation/code. When I open this function, the program will automatically copy text when I use mouse to select it. That will be fine in OS X. But in some application like parallel, it will show this problem.  Solution: cancel this function in the codeEudic/code program setting.  <comment267315> You maybe consider GIFing the problem? <comment267324> @nicael Excuse me, what's meaning of GIFing? <comment267325> Please take a GIF of your problem. <comment267329> Do you have any apps running in the background that could be responsible for this behaviour? This is very irregular but apps like Autopairs can modify the usual keyboard input. <comment267331> @Konrad How can I know which program I run in background? I type `htop` but can't have any idea. <comment267334> Hey, that's pretty cool. How'd you make that .gif? <comment268113> @tjt263 I use quicktime to capture the screen and saves into MOV. And then use ffmpeg `ffmpeg -ss 0  -i C-problem.mov -t 30 -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 10 -f gif - | gifsicle --optimize=3 --delay=3  C_problem.gif`
