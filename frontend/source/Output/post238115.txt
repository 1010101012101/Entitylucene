In Applescript, search the web <body> How would I have Applescript display the first one or two options in a google search in a display dialog window? Is there a way to create a functional browser through applescript?  <answer238123> This is very easy:  ol liGet some text to search for. You can use "Ask for text". Or something like the following:/li /ol    precodedisplay dialog "What do you want to search for?" default answer "" /code/pre  ol start="2" liMake a Google search URL. I used this snippet:/li /ol    precodeon run {input, parameters}       return "https://www.google.com/search?q=" &amp; input end run /code/pre  ol start="3" liGet the contents from the webpage. I used "Get text from webpage", which is the easiest way by far. It's also possible to simply get the source of the page and use regexes to extract the data from there./li liDecide how to display the data. A quick and dirty way to do this is:/li /ol    precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "System Events" to display alert "result:" &amp; input     return input end run /code/pre  <comment291891> There is no "Ask for text" or "Get text from webpage" in AppleScript!  The question never mentioned using Automator and your answer doesn't mention it either, while the answer you offer does require Automator! Not a well formed answer! <comment291892> I believe that they all have straight up applescript equivalents. I will see about editing this.
