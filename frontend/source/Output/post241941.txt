Question regarding iFile <body> I was just curious if I copied all of the contents of iFile from like the root folder, and then upgraded my iphone's ios version, rejailbroke my iphone, and redownloaded ifile, if I copied the contents into the new ifile would it basically be like it saved my previous jailbreak?  I know the current ios version doesn't have a jailbreak out, I'm just curious if per say this would work?  <answer242075>    @IronCraftMan No it wouldn't work   Is correct you would be better off making a backup with iTunes and using some tool to save your SHSH blobs so you can downgrade, there are some jailbreak backup utilities but I cannot vouch for the validity or security of them.  <comment297413> No it wouldn't work <comment347164> IronCraftMan is right! Does not work (:
