Window drag delay to move across spaces: Adjust in Yosemite <body> The tip presented here (http://osxdaily.com/2010/02/10/change-the-delay-when-dragging-windows-within-spaces/) no longer works.   Is there a new setting we can use?   I know how petty this sounds, but 1000 milliseconds is far too long to wait.   <comment188485> Not an answer, but if you have hotkeys set up for Space changing [I use ctr/numpad] then you can grab the title bar & hit the hotkey for instant transition to any Space. <comment188490> Yep, I already do this, but I don't really want to use up "valuable" key combo slots for this, plus it's extremely awkward to do any keyboard stuff while actively dragging a window with the trackpad. <comment188492> ah, trackpadâ€¦ work of the devil ;) also, no numpad, so fewer key combo options. Understand. <comment188493> Yup I can use all the space I can get... <comment188494> Agree; there's no such thing as too much desktop space - I have 2x27" 2k screens & still use 6 Spaces ;)
