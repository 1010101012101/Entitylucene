Dock Notifications Displaying Odd Red Icons Instead <body> Having an odd issue. My dock is showing these strange red icons where normal numerical notifications should be. For example, Thunderbird will display a 3 when I have 3 new messages, but instead it is showing this red A? icon. This happens with all the apps in my dock that display a notification.   See attached screen shot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rKKOk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Notice the Thunderbird icon at the top and the Printer icon at the bottom.  Anyway to get my standard notifications back?  <answer13901> This looks like it might be a problem with a system font.  Try this...  ol liOpen Font Book (in code/Applications/code)/li liSelect the "All Fonts" collection in the left-hand pane/li liClick any font in the right-hand pane to focus that pane/li liSelect all the fonts using Edit - Select All or kbdCmd/kbd+kbdA/kbd/li liIn the File menu, click "Validate Fonts"/li /ol  If any fonts are corrupt, this method should alert you to the problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XnpSe.png" alt="Font Book - Validate Fonts menu option"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jVZfg.png" alt="Font Book - Font Validation window"  <comment14821> Looks like a system font problem to me.  Has it always been this way on your Mac?  I presume you have tried restarting your computer...? <comment14823> No, but I don't know what triggered it. And yes, have restarted several times. <comment14845> The glyph looks like one from the [Last Resort font](http://developer.apple.com/fonts/LastResortFont/) that is used when the requested font is not available. Most of the system UI uses Lucida Grande, but I am not sure if this also applies to your particular dock icon badges. Use *Font Book* to check that **Lucida Grande** is present, enabled, and validates correctly.
