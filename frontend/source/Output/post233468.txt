Why does `whoami` give a different answer than Current User in Users & Groups? <body> I don't recall exactly what info I was asked to provide at the time I set the mac up, which is leading to some confusion.  On my mac, when I run codewhoami/code in a terminal, it tells me codeaerovistae/code, my general username. However, if I open Users &amp; Groups, it tells me the current user is codemyFirstName myLastName/code.  Why is this? Is it the same account, and it has two different name properties? What is the difference?  <answer233479> It is the same account. The name displayed in Users &amp; Groups is your full name, the one shown by codewhomami/code is the name of the account as known to the underlying Unix system (and also used as the folder name for your home folder). To check yourself, open Users &amp; Groups, unlock if necessary and then right-click on your user name in the left column. This will show you the technical details behind your account.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/51HFF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
