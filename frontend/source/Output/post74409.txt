How do you change the screen saver at the log in screen? <body> I migrated from Lion on an iMac to Mountain Lion on a Mini. The log in screen uses the clunky default message screen saver. I'd like to change it. I tried logging in as root and changing the screen saver on that account to no avail. Any ideas?  Thanks.  <comment86415> Nevermindâ€”seems to have resolved itself. I did a repair permissions and the changed screen saver now works. Not sure if that did it, but it's all good.
