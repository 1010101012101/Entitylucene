Upgrading RAM/HDD in latest MBP <body> I planning to buy a 13 inch MBP this month. Is it a good idea to stick to the standard 4GB of ram and 500GB harddrive, and upgrade it myself to 8GB/1TB? This would save me about $350. I have experience opening/repairing laptops, but I never had a MBP.. would this void my warranty?  <answer24574> that's an excellent idea. Apple clearly overprices hardware upgrades.  And don't worry, it's super-easy to do (be sure to buy a Philips #00 and a T6 torx screwdriver) and it strongdoesn't void/strong your warranty!  for detailed step-by-step guides you can go to ifixit.com .   <comment27589> Thanks, even with the extra screwdrivers I'll end up much cheaper! <comment27590> Not that this should deter you, but just so that you know; the machine's warranty will not cover these aftermarket upgrades. If either of those parts fail, it's down to you to get them replaced under their own respective warranties.
