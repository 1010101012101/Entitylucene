Is there chance to find file structure with filenames of lost secondary hdd? <body> Recently I've crashed my secondary hdd that was in cd-rom bay and I dont want to recover it. (Its not possible) All I want to know if there a chance to see file structure and filenames of some folder of that dead hdd. My osx and primary ssd disk now is still the same, and still working properly. I'm dj and I really need to know my audio file names. And yes I have Itunes with playlists, but mainly my workflow is to work with folders and files directly through finder! Thank you very much!   <comment337462> Does this mean you did not have a Time Machine backup? If not, then the only way for the community to give you meaningful advice is to know what you've already tried? You state _I dont want to recover it. (Its not possible)_, so presumably you've tried things before coming to that conclusion? Can you clarify this by editing your question and including what steps you've taken thus far? <comment337513> There is chance a to recover my files by giving my HDD to extra hardware gurus, and it will cost me a lot. (maybe I will return to that option later) By now I'm just curious if there a file on my primary SSD left with file structure history of my secondary HDD that is dead by now. Yes, I did not have any backup. Thanks!
