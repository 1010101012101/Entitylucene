Is it possible to set touch bar in F1-F12 mode for a specific app? <body> I am happy with touch bar in general, but when I am working I want F1-F12 keys when editor is open. Is there a way to make touch bar go in function keys mode when editor becomes active?  <answer261681> Yes:  System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts   Select "Function Keys" and hit the plus sign.    Select the app you want to have the function keys display for as default.
