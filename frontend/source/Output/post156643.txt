Keyboard shortcut for switching windows not working in Yosemite <body> While on OS X 10.9 it works nice to switch windows of all apps (not produced by apple) I am using in my work like Google Chrome, SublimeText, iTerm from keyboard using:  kbdcmd ⌘/kbd + kbd`/kbd  On OS X 10.10 it works only with apple apps ;(  Is there something changed, what third-party applications developers should change, or is some other keyboard shortcut to get this working as it should?  strongUPDATE:/strong - I restored all keyboard settings to default, and things started working as expected.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rlkVd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Make sure that this one checkbox is checked:  <answer170442> It seems not to work in full screen mode of apps. Switching to normal mode everything works fine.  <answer184842> I've bought a Macbook Pro with german keyboard a couple of weeks ago. It came with Yosemite installed, I was looking for the same shortcut, I found that Cmd + &lt; does the trick.    <answer261870> Go to system preferences/keyboard/shortcuts/keyboard and then check box to the left of "Move focus to next window' [command `]  Before I checked box, there was no keyboard shortcut to cycle between open windows or tabs on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.  After checking box, command` cycles between open windows/tabs in all browsers  <comment184182> Cmd + ~ is still working in Yosemite to switch windows in non-Apple apps for me. <comment184184> The key combination is cmd - ` rather than cmd - ~. Perhaps on your keyboard these symbols are not on the same key? <comment184185> @amergin Indeed my mistake, I meant of course `\`` and not `~`. But this still does not work for me on non-apple apps ;( <comment196281> This does not work for me. Which keyboard layout are you using? <comment196283> **EDIT** It actually works but I had to press ⌘⇧ and the key next to backspace on my Swedish keyboard. Without ⇧ I get the ´ acute accent, not ` grave accent (or "backtick" as illiterates call it). <comment232807> That seems to open settings on mine (standard keyboard) <comment354567> Thank you! Mine was mapped to ⌘ F1 and I never set it to that. It must be something to do with region settings. Japanese region settings here on a US keyboard. (And previously used a Japanese keyboard)
