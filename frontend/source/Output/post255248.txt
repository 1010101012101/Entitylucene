Movie turned black in iMovie, Help! <body> I've spent hours on a video and all of a sudden the Movie turned black in iMovie, Help! It was imported from a camera and deleted on the memory stick, now its turned black since I turned it off in the timeline I think.  <comment317863> What software versions are you using? <comment317865> Latest: iMovie 10.1.2
