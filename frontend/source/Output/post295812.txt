Can Teamviewer be run without installing on a Mac for controlling another machine? <body> In Windows you can choose to just run the executable without installing it but I don't see this option in the Mac installer. You can run the TV Quicksupport module on the host on Mac without installing but I am asking about the controlling side. Before I have used TV via a web browser but this option appears to have been deprecated now. Thank you.  <answer295813> strongThe following is based on information gathered from the TeamViewer web site and running the corresponding downloads for each:/strong  ul liUnder emWindows/em, strongTeamViewer/strong Installation options, using strongTeamViewer_Setup.exe/strong, are:  ul liBasic installation/li liInstallation to access this computer remotely (unattended)/li liRun only (one time use)/li /ul/li liUnder emmacOS/em, strongTeamViewer/strong requires installation to use it.  ul liThe, strongTeamViewer.dmg/strong file contains the strongInstall TeamViewer.pkg/strong, which is an installer, not the strongTeamViewer.app/strong that gets installed by running the installer package./li /ul/li liUnder emWindows/em and emmacOS/em, strongTeamViewer Host/strong requires installation to use it.  ul liUnder emWindows/em, the strongTeamViewer_Host_Setup.exe/strong installs strongTeamViewer Host/strong./li liUnder emmacOS/em, the strongTeamViewerHost.dmg/strong file contains the strongInstall TeamViewerHost.pkg/strong file, which is an installer, not the strongTeamViewerHost.app/strong that gets installed by running the installer package./li /ul/li liUnder emWindows/em and emmacOS/em, strongTeamViewer QuickSupport/strong does not requires installation to use it.  ul liUnder emWindows/em, the strongTeamViewerQS.exe/strong can be run directly after downloading it and does not install./li liUnder emmacOS/em, the strongTeamViewerQS.dmg/strong file contains the strongTeamViewerQS.app/strong which can just be doubled-clicked to run the application, and does not install./li /ul/li liUnder emWindows/em, strongTeamViewer Portable/strong does not requires installation to use it.  ul listrongTeamViewer Portable/strong is not available for emmacOS/em./li /ul/li /ul  <comment373594> Welcome to Ask Different.  What does success look like. Run team viewer on your Mac to control a remote device or os?  You might need to edit your post if it gets closed or no answers show up. <comment373598> To control a remote macOS install yes. I think the question is pretty clear about it. <comment373625> I see. In reality in Windows you use the same executable to install and run TV without installing it. It is a pity that this is not the same case for Mac.
