Mac AppStore badge does not reset after installing update <body> I am experiencing a strange problem: after I installed a bunch of updates, the Mac AppStore badge was not reset. When I go to "Updates", I get the message "no updates available". I tried to   ul lidelete the AppStore cookie/li lirebuild the Spotlight index (found a recommendation to do so somewhere)/li lilogged out and in the AppStore/li lidelete some of the updated Apps and re-installed them/li /ul  without any effect. Today, I got an update for another application; the update count was incremented and was not reset again.  Any ideas?  <answer74469> A reboot did the trick. Badge is reset.  <answer74485> Rather than rebooting, you can just type codekillall Dock/code from your terminal application. It will reset the dock and clear the badges.  <comment106025> That trick didn't work for me. The badge was removed for a few moments, but popped up again. <comment110560> Did the new alerts pop up because you had valid messages? The killall Dock is something Apple actually recommends on their support site. <comment110618> No, there weren't any updates at that time. After one update was available the problem is now resolved for me.
