Programmatically 'auto hide menubar' in El capitan <body> I really love the 'auto hide menubar' option in El Capitan, but sometimes I like it (private) sometimes I don't (work). Is there a way to show/hide it programmatically by changed it's value in a plist file? If so, in which plist file is that setting found? Any help is appreciated.  strongUpdate/strong   A bit more details about the circumstances: I use applescripts or bash scripts a lot to automate certain mundane tasks, like opening all my professional applications when I arrive at work. Usually I even export an applescript as an application so I can run it with spotlight, thus by entering one simple command in spotlight, all the relevant apps open. I'd love to do be able to toggle the auto-hide feature like this. It doesn't matter that much to me if this is done via editing a plist file with bash commands or automating it in some way via applescript.  <answer210088> Here's how you can set the menubar to be hidden and unhidden using defaults:  To hide:  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain _HIHideMenuBar -bool true /code/pre  To show:  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain _HIHideMenuBar -bool false /code/pre  Once run, logout and log back in. Alternatively, you can run the following command as the logged-in user to restart Finder and show the changes:  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  <comment253223> I think that Stack Overflow will be more appropriate for the programmatically side of your question. <comment253229> Cool, will repost there. Thanks! <comment253285> As long as "programmatically" means AppleScript, shell scripts or similar methods, the question is totally on-topic on AD. Can you describe in more detail under which circumstances you want to show/hide the menu bar? <comment253355> I'm also thinking this isn't a SO question. Much better to keep it here IMO. <comment253476> @patrix I added more details about the circumstances for clarity. <comment253535> Thanks, this did the job. Only downside is the logout/login part (killall Finder works fine, except when you have many apps open, they need to be closed one by one) but I can live with that.
