Why am I getting these errors when trying to install php 5.5.0? <body> So I am trying to upgrade the native php installation on my mac and i keep getting these errors:  precodeld: library not found for -ljpeg clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) make: *** [libs/libphp5.bundle] Error 1 /code/pre  Anybody know what the problem is?  <comment111938> How are you trying to upgrade the php? First thought is  don't, better to install a newer version in another directory and do not overwrite the Apple supplied version. <comment111991> I was just doing it via the terminal as per a Tuts+ premium video I found. How do I install into a new directory and then use that as default? <comment112004> The issue is that you are missing libjpeg.dylib - the easy way I think is tou se a package manager like macports or home-brew <comment112007> Ok so what I have done is home brewed php now and even though i have done it php -v still shows version 5.3.15 any idea how to sort this? <comment112068> change your `PATH` to reflect where homebrew installed PHP.
