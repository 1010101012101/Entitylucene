How to download the Command Line Tools for Xcode without the Downloads for Developers webpage? <body> I'm trying to install the Command Line Tools for Xcode so that I can use homebrew to install some packages I need for some rudimentary programming exercises; I would rather not install the entirety of Xcode (again) as it's pretty bulky for something I rarely use, and I prefer a minimalistic IDE. Supposedly, Apple has released the command line tools separately, but for whatever reason, when I sign into the Downloads for Developers page, I get some sort of weird error where the page will not populate with downloads the majority of the time, and even when it will (rarely) I can't find the command tools I'm looking for. Apparently you can also download the OSX GCC Installer from Kenneth Reitz's blog, but it seems to be obsolete now that there's an official Apple version.  Are there any other avenues I can pursue? What could be going on with the website?  <answer88589> Indeed you can download them from the Apple Developer downloads page.  If the page isn't working, I would follow Matthieu's advice and try another browser or computer.  <answer90163> It seems to have disappeared from the list of downloads. I got nothing using Chrome, then switched to Safari and then the search started working.  But no results for "Command Line Tools"  <answer91794> I experienced the same problem. Just uncheck the filter for "Applications" on the left bar, and you'll be able to see the download list.  <answer93293> I had a similar problem in Firefox, but just cleared the cookies, and it was good.  <answer98764> You can download the XCode 4.x CLTools packages from their official download site via direct links.  Here is a script that will automate the install process for you sup1/sup.  To find updated links for the tools, you can use this command:  precodecurl -Ls https://devimages.apple.com.edgekey.net/downloads/xcode/simulators/index-3905972D-B609-49CE-8D06-51ADC78E07BC.dvtdownloadableindex | plutil -convert json -o - - | python -mjson.tool | less /code/pre  sub[1] Please don't abuse/overload their servers/sub  <answer106716> The command line tools aren't offered via Xcode 5.0.1, but I was able to install them via this terminal command.  precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  It will prompt you that it needs the command line tools and will offer to install them.  Worked like a charm for me.  <answer157226> Once Xcode is installed, the command-line tools can be installed by launching Xcode and following those steps:  ol liXcode  Preferences...

I don't have access to another at the moment, but I'll try as soon as I can. <comment103771> I have tried Chrome, Safari and Firefox (and reset all three of them). <comment103785> One solution could be finding a torrent or Direct-Download link for this ... But It might not be as secure as a file from Apple... <comment103787> I considered that. It seems a bit silly to have to go all the way around when it should be so simple, but you're right, it may be a solution. <comment103789> Or maybe you could ask someone else to download it for you. <comment103840> Just tried to download it, using someone else's computer, and someone else's Apple ID. Still no luck. Very strange. <comment105834> It is there for me, just listed on the downloads page no search needed <comment105841> If you are an admin, you can create another account and test with that. That would avoid any corrupt preferences or cache files. <comment107840> Have you reditered as a developer? <comment109452> â€¦ [to offer general developer website feedback, you can contact Apple Developer Program Support](https://developer.apple.com/contact/). <comment135597> this is silly, but actually works. Thanks! <comment144871> Doesn't work here... says --install is not a valid option. <comment151606> @Matt What version of OS X are you running? <comment151607> By now, 10.9 Mavericks <comment184851> The OP says "I would rather not install the entirety of Xcode " <comment227284> Have had an extremely frustrating time trying to get to the download page on apple (enter un/pw then takes you to a different login screen, enter un/pw and it takes you to update your account details screen). This was the solution that finally allowed me to get the direct download link. Thanks. <comment227826> Yes, I can empathize with this frustration... Apple has decided to keep their download links secret and only accessible to people who have logged into the developer site.  Although there are ways around this that involve either manually logging in & grabbing cookies, or some automation tool that either automates the browser or makes multiple requests to POST to the login form, and allows the final request to use the same authentication cookies... these can be difficult and fragile to implement & base an installation script on. <comment227827> I've found that the most reliable way to automate XCode or CLTools deployment has been to first login manually, then save the appropriate `.dmg` file locally on a fileserver.  Then the automation script can simply download the `.dmg` from the local fileserver "package repo" and proceed with install. <comment227829> @AidanKane: You may also be interested in some of my related answers for more context & scripts: [Install Command Line Tools completely from Command Line](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/190397/46665), [Fully Automated XCode Installation](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27497521) <comment291363> Worked for me on 10.11.4 El Capitan.

I am beginner and so for me it was helpful.
