Can't rewrite CD with 2012 MBP <body> I have a refurb 2012 Macbook Pro still under warranty.  I have watched DVDs on it, and have burned audio onto blank audio CDs.  Ran out of blanks, so I put in a CD-RW that already had one short track on it.  iTunes offered to import.  I said no and played the track to verify I wouldn't mind erasing it.  Launched Disk Utility.  Disk Utility says it is uninitialized and "Erase" is grayed out.  Back to iTunes.  Tried to burn a playlist.  Ejects and asks "Please insert a blank disc"  Put it back in: "This disk is not blank."  Advice?  precodemacOS 10.12.5 (16F73) iTunes 12.6.1.25 Drive: HL-DT-ST DVDRW  GS41N:    Firmware Revision:    UA04   Interconnect: ATAPI   Burn Support: Yes (Generic Drive Support)   Profile Path: None   Cache:    768 KB   Reads DVD:    Yes   CD-Write: -R, -RW   DVD-Write:    -R, -R DL, -RW, +R, +R DL, +RW   Write Strategies: CD-TAO, CD-SAO, CD-Raw, DVD-DAO /code/pre
