You can still use package managers like homebrew and macports to install an alternative GIT.  hr  The code/usr/bin/code directory is restricted by SIP. You first need to temporarily disable it by booting to recovery, starting Terminal, and executing codecsrutil disable/code (then codecsrutil enable/code to re-enable`).  Once you have SIP disabled, you can remove git from code/usr/bin/code.  See Also:  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899 (About SIP)/li /ul  hr  Note: You can check for SIP restrictions with the code-Ol/code flags with ls. If it isn't restricted, you will see a hyphen, and if it is, you will see restricted.  <comment306506> While this may be a way to remove it, the OP should use a package manager such as homebrew to install a newer version instead.
