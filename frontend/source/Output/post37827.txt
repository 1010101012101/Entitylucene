How to troubleshoot when a video won't sync to iPhone <body> I downloaded some videos that I wanted to put on my iPhone (Oredev talks, from http://vimeo.com/channels/oredev, so from the web and not iTunes).  The videos are all seemingly in the right format, and they play using Quicktime and in iTunes.  But when I select them for sync to my iPhone, only a few of the several I've tried have transferred successfully.  The most frustrating thing is that there's no information on why this isn't working.  Is there some kind of log or other place I could look for errors or other messages on why the  item didn't sync?  I'm assuming it's just being very picky about the format, but I'd really like to get more insight before I just start blindly trying things.  UPDATE: I ran the videos through HandBrake, and, while it did seem to help, there's at least one video that still won't sync onto my iPhone.  It's checked for sync in iTunes, and iTunes doesn't tell me anything went wrong.  There must be some kind of log I can check to see why the item didn't sync, right?  <comment42945> What method are you using to sync the movies? And into what application? <comment42948> These are files I downloaded straight off of the Vimeo website.  I'm doing a drag/drop to add them to my iTunes library.  There's nothing that's reporting an error at any step.  I'm probably going to run them through HandBrake to see if that helps, but mostly what I want is for iTunes to tell me why it's not syncing the files to my iPhone so I can fix whatever problem there is. <comment74082> Check the presets to make sure you are iphone compatible? <comment75346> Is there anything in particular to check?  The video does play in iTunes, and others that are compressed with the same settings are loading on to the device with no problems.
