Can I set my Mac to auto-accept Bluetooth file-transfers from my phone? <body> Transferring photos from my Android smartphone to my laptop via Bluetooth is really easy, but the laptop always pops up an "Incoming File" dialog asking if I want to accept the file-transfer. I can choose an "Accept all" checkbox, but that only seems to apply for the current connection -- not future connections.  Is there any way to set my Mac to trust my phone and automatically accept transfers?  <answer27738> Open up System Preferences  Sharing  Bluetooth  You should see the options you can set there; use the drop selection to what you prefer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rBsT0.png" alt="Bluetooth Sharing Options"
