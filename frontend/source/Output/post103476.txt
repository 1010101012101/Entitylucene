Removing non App Store apps <body> I use several apps installed using code.dmg/code files downloaded from other sources rather than direct from the App Store.  When I try to remove them through Launchpad, these apps will not show the strongX/strong button to allow me to delete them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZYxG.png" width="350"br supOn the right: Mac App Store app; On the left: app from external source./sup  Is there any canonical safety way to remove them?  If I put them in Trash, will they disappear from my Mac without any related directories? How can I completely remove an app?  <answer103483> To remove just the app you can drag it to the trash, use kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⌫ backspace/kbd, or right-click → strongMove to Trash/strong the app.  To remove the app, its preference files, and other related files, you will need another app along the lines of the free AppCleaner application.  Here is a Lifehacker article titled "The Best App Uninstaller for Mac", which chose AppCleaner as the best uninstaller for the Mac (in 2011).  <answer193536>    There isn't an app out there which really deletes all of the files   related to a certain app. To be completely sure, you have to do it by   hand.   ol liOpen up the Terminal /li liType in codesudo find / -iname "*YOURAPPNAME*" -print &gt; ~/Desktop/uninstall.txt/code/li liOpen the uninstall.txt file at your Desktop and look at the content/li liNow go through, line by line, and when you are sure a path is related to your app, type this on the command line (emthe path is just an example here/em):/li licodesudo rm -r "~/Library/Application\ Support/APPNAME"/code/li /ol  strongMany apps don't look deep enough, or in favor of security, don't delete all files they find./strong
