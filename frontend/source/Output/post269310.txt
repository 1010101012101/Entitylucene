macOS apache installs on different directory with homebrew, how to start/stop? <body> Im strugling to understand different installations of apache on macOS. As i now can say i have two installations of apache2 one in /private/etc/apache2 -this one seams to be installed by default with the system /usr/local/etc/apache2/2.4 -this one i install with brew  if i codebrew install/uninstall httpd24/code it un/installs a symlink in /usr/local/bin/apachectl that makes the brew server under /usr/local/etc/apache2/2.4 start. But as i read (if i understand correctly) macOS comes with apache in /private/etc/apache2 wich when already running and i install brew it doesn't take the apachectl commands anymore... so im not able to stop it until i codebrew uninstall httpd24/code and then codesudo apachectl stop/code.  i can reach localhost:80 -system apache and localhost:8080 - brew apache  so how can i controll the system apache when i have brew version installed?  <answer270848> TL:DR; Use code/usr/sbin/apachectl/code  The issue is that you have bins for both versions, and as they have the same name. Your code.bashrc/code / code.bash_profile/code configuration will determine the order bin folder are included, which determines which wins.  It's generally a good idea to code/usr/local/bin/code win, as this is stuff you installed yourself and not something that comes with the OS by default.  The location of the codeapachectl/code script for the apache installed on macOS is located in code/usr/sbin/code, so you can run it directly using code/usr/sbin/apachectl/code. Alternately you can make an alias or symlink for this to make a unique command.
