iTunes movies HD Rental advertised as 5.1 surround, but only plays in stereo <body> "The Revenant" is clearly labeled on the iTunes store as 5.1 surround. But after purchasing and playing the HD Rental (yes it was fully buffered) it only output in stereo on Windows 10.  The Netflix app outputs 5.1 surround correctly, and so do games, and so do 5.1 surround sound music downloads played through VLC, so I know my set up is correct.  Am I missing a setting? Also, can I get a refund?  <answer236252> This is a long-term issue for Windows 10.  I've seen problems with all 5.1 sound going back 18 months.  Most posts I've seen say to try this:  ul liGo to your strongWindows Sounds/strong settings/li liUnder strongPlayback/strong, select strongSpeakers/strong and go to their strongProperties/strong/li liUnder strongEnhancements/strong, deselect the codeDisable all enhancements/code checkbox/li liActivate the codeEnable Speaker Fill/code checkbox and click strongOk/strong/li /ul  If that doesn't work, try this:  ul liGo to the sound settings/li liSelect your device/li licodeProperties =&gt; Advanced/code tab then select strong24bit, 96000Hz/strong from the dropdown/li /ul  <comment290319> `Enable Speaker Fill` does create the 5.1 effect, but this is synthesized. Netflix app will play it natively with out virtualization.
