Prevent Network Settings From Changing Automatically <body> How can I stop Network Settings from being able to change without my permission? Couldn't find anything under "Security" in Settings.  hr  OSX 10.9.5 (Mavericks)  strongChanges (broke Internet):/strong Settings - Network - Advanced  ol liTCP/IP - Configure IPv6: "Link-local only" (vs. "Automatically")/li liProxies - Web Proxy (HTTP) emChecked/em (vs. emUnchecked/em)/li /ol  Running emTunnelBear VPN/em (which turns off IPv6 automatically to prevent leakage when using "Vigilant" mode) and emUBlock Origin/em. I suspect they may have something to do with changes.
