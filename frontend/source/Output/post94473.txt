Is there a mail application that would set the account from which the mails will be sent depending on the recipients? <body> I have a question similar to this, but instead of focusing on Mail.app, I am wondering if there is any mail application that can do that.  Ideally, I can tag contacts/emails with different email accounts. For example, I would tag my friends' contacts with my personal email account, and coworkers with my work email account. When I compose an email and put my friends' email in the recipient field, the mail application should automatically set the correct outgoing account for me, or warn me when I press Send.  Does such an application exist? Thanks!
