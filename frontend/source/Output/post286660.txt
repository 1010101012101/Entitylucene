Export PPT as mp4 or mov in PowerPoint <body> I want to export my presentation as video. Followed this: Save a presentation as a movie file or MP4.  But I can't find any video formats in the Export menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FUer1.png" alt="PowerPoint Export options"  Should I install any extension separately to have this work? Is there any other software which does conversion of presentations to video with all transitions and animations.  P.S: I use PowerPoint for Mac Version 15.34 [Office 2016].  <answer286665> From the site you've linked to:     NOTE: This feature is only available to Office 365 subscribers. If you have an Office 365 subscription, make sure you have the latest version of Office.   <answer286684> Sorry to answer this question myself. I had commented on a thread in Reddit who had a similar issue, and thanks to atomicshed, he linked me to another thread at Microsoft's site.  This solution worked for me:     Quit all Office 2016 apps      Rename the file /Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensingV2.plist to something else      Open any Office 2016 application, and sign in again to Activate the Subscription.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIBPD.png" alt="Export Menu"  Now am able to export it as both MP4 and MOV. Thank you guys!   <comment361730> I believe @patrix has the answer.  Looking at the "About Powerpoint" window, mine says `Version 15.33 License: Office 365 Subscription`  I have the ability to export to MOV, MP4, etc on a plain vanilla install. <comment361755> Yes, I do have a Office 365 subscription: https://i.imgur.com/MrCz2RA.png. This issue is so weird. <comment361758> @Allan Though I had Office 365 Subscription, the About Powerpoint window didn't have the words you mentioned except Version. Disabling and Enabling the license helped me link the License properly. Works fine now. <comment361761> Upvoted the answer - I was aware that the O365 version was slightly different than the 2016 version, but I didn't know that a simple tweak of a plist would be the factor.  Great work!  I'm adding this to my notes for future reference! <comment361824> What a weird thing to lock behind a subscription. For anyone who doesn't have Office 365, consider just using Quicktime Player to record the screen. Not quite as painless, but still a fairly quick process vs buying a subscription. <comment361864> Answering your own question is not only allowed, but explicitly encouraged.  https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/07/01/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/ Thanks for following up! <comment362112> Yes, that's a better option.
