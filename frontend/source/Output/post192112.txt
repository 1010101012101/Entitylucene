Cannot connect to LAN with USB Ethernet adapter <body> I had bought a Giga LAN USB 3.0 ethernet adapter for my new 12" MacBook. I just installed the driver required but the MacBook does not recognize the adapter (showing no ethernet connected) and can't connect internet using LAN. If I use the adapter with a Windows laptop, it is ok. Is it due to software or hardware problem?  <comment228392> Please add the model of the USB LAN adapter and a link to the driver you downloaded. <comment228475> If you try and add a connection method in the Network System Preferences pane, is there an option for USB Ethernet?
