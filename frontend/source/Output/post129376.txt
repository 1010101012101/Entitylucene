How to fix npm to find correct node enviorment? <body> I have installed homebrew via boxen. I did not know that codenpm update -g/code is a bad thing to do, as npm runs amok trying to update itself. Hence, npm stopped working. I am now trying to get node and npm back to work again.  I have installed the node via homebrew:  precode$ brew unlink node &amp;&amp; brew link node Unlinking /opt/boxen/homebrew/Cellar/node/0.10.26... 5 symlinks removed Linking /opt/boxen/homebrew/Cellar/node/0.10.26... 4 symlinks created /code/pre  Yet npm claims that   precode$ npm nodenv: version `v0.10.26' is not installed /code/pre  Running nodenv indeed shows that the current version is not found:  precode$ nodenv versions v0.10 v0.10.21 v0.6 v0.6.20 v0.8 v0.8.8 /code/pre  I am confused as to why nodenev shows all the versions it does.  How do I fix nodejs and npm?  <answer129406> I consider this a workaround, if there is a way to get node upgraded the brew way, I appreciate it.  It seems that boxen in its standard configuration only provides v0.10.21 yet once codenpm/code updated itself, it expects v0.10.26.  I tried to reconfigure boxen to install node yet failed.  I then went along and installed NodeJs manually over the pgk provided by nodejs.org and globally installed node 0.10.26. Then codenodenv/code was able to find that version and by setting   precodenodenv global v0.10.26 /code/pre  npm started working again. I then had to reinstall certain packages not expecting that v0.10.26 version, e.g. bower version.  <comment151445> You probably want to uninstall it not just link - note that you can really only use one package manager as they will conflict as shown here
