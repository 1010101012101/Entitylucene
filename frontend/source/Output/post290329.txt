How to know whether Mac has SSD or HDD installed <body> How do I know whether my Mac has a SSD or HDD installed without having to literally open my Mac?  PS. Is there anyway to know it from Disk Utility?  <answer290331> ul liApple Menu - About This Mac - System Report/li liSelect Disk Drive (or however it's called in english) in the Hardware section/li liSelect "Macintosh HD" on top/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yCouX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively you can run codesystem_profiler SPSerialATADataType/code or codesystem_profiler SPStorageDataType/code in Terminal which more or less gives you the same information  <comment366490> Only the terminal command lines worked for me.I have a SSD installed in my Mac. <comment366505> Hold it up to your ear haha <comment366509> Does it start in a second? <comment366618> Yeah it starts in 8 seconds. <comment367497> Disk Utility and then Info tells you as well, as does "about this mac", and the storage tab there. Tells the bus type too (SATA/PCI/USB)
