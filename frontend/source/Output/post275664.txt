The disk is OS Journaled file type 100%. My mate was painting and he moved the drive and caused unsafe disconnect. Now First aid reports problems with Partition map.  What does this mean? How can this be fixed?  <comment346790> Welcome to Ask Different! To make it easier for us to help you, please be more specific about what's happening and what steps you have taken to resolve it. Some good information would be: computer model and year, OS, whether or not this drive has ever worked before, what you have tried to do, etc. <comment346791> disk1s1 usually neither is HFS nor journaled but EFI (FAT32), so fsck_hfs as well as replaying journals won't help here. <comment346793> I am on OS X El Captain.

I know how to use terminal so if anyone can give me the right commands this should be quick to fix. <comment346806> @klanomath output posted above <comment346808> @klanomath same return: sudo gpt -r show disk1 Password: gpt show: unable to open device 'disk1': Resource busy <comment346809> diskutil verifyVolume disk1 Error starting file system verification for (bad disk ref): Disk object invalid or unable to serialize (-69810) <comment346810> @MarsSpiders gpt and diskutil are two different tools. `gpt` reads(/writes) the partition table of a disk and requires a disk as argument. `diskutil verifyVolume ...` requires a partition (volume) as argument. Therefore `sudo gpt -r show disk1` and `diskutil verifyVolume disk1s2`. Simply copy & paste the commands! If the disk is stubborn detach and reattach it. You have to get a possible new / different disk identifier of the drive with `diskutil list` before entering`sudo gpt ...` or `diskutil ...`. <comment346813> @klanomath see above UPDATE 2
