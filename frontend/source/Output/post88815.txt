Apache VirtualDocumentRoot, MAMP, .local domain & xip.io? <body> I have a problem making xip.io works. I have set up my machine to use virtualhosts with MAMP code.local/code domain name.  this is my httpd-vhosts.conf file:  precodeNameVirtualHost *:80 UseCanonicalName Off  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     VirtualDocumentRoot /Users/&lt;myusername&gt;/Sites/%-1/%-2+/build     &lt;Directory "/Users/&lt;myusername&gt;/Sites"&gt;         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews         AllowOverride All         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     &lt;/Directory&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  When I try to access for example codehttp://project.local.&lt;my local ip&gt;.xip.io/code it doesn't work while codehttp://project.local/code works. How can I fix this?  Also, I have read that the code.local/code domain on Mac can cause some problems, is this true?  <answer101427> I use MAMP Pro and the file codehttpd-vhosts.conf/code does not contain this setting, but in the app I have this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6kXF.png" alt="ServerAlias example.*xip.io"  The host is codehttp://plugins.dev/code and if my memory serves me well, it's all that's needed to have it working.  <comment104102> On OSX .local is used by Bonjour for local discovery of ips by name without using DNS (see [RFC 6762](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) <comment104155> Have you edited the hosts file? <comment104234> yes, my Hosts file is edited
