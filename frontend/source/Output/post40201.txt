What's the equivalent of windows explorer? <body> The documentation says that Finder replaces windows explorer.  However I have gone to my home directory in a terminal and created a directory with  precodemkdir temp /code/pre  How can I browse this directory using Finder?  At the moment I cannot see it at all.  <answer40205> ul liYou can access the finder via the Dock:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LXTnQ.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liWhen in the terminal, you can open the current directory in the terminal via:  codeopen ./code/li /ul  Here's a finder window. I've created the directory code~/temp/code like you said.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mEqvX.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also kbd&#x2318;/kbd-click the info icon at the very top to see the path:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Mn3z.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment45453> what software do you use to make screenshots with arrows like that? <comment45454> @Michiel I make the screenshots using the [build-in feature](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/33907/13414) of the OS. Then I edit the pictures using the free app [Skitch](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skitch/id425955336?mt=12). It's very easy to use. <comment45455> This works as expected for me (I'm using Mac OS X Lion). If I `CD ~` (to the home directory) and enter `mkdir temp`, a new temp folder appears in Finder. One way you can view the contents of the Home Folder in Finder is by clicking on the Desktop background and then pressing the `Shift+âŒ˜+H` key combination. Are you confusing the Desktop with the Home Folder? Which documentation are you referring too? <comment45458> Skitch! That's the one! Thanks <comment45461> Preview can also make some arrows on screen shots as well, but Skitch makes it much nicer. <comment45471> Just to be precise, the Finder doesn't replace Windows Explorer; Windows Explorer was Microsoft's attempt to duplicate the functionality of the Finder. The Finder was a feature on the Mac in 1984, long before Windows Explorer. <comment45501> For screen shots, I use SnagIt for Mac, from Techsmith. <comment45503> @Daniel, these kids today just don't understand. :-)
