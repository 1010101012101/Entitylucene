How bad is a runny nose over a MacBook Pro? <body> Happy cold season, everybody!  Or at least, it'll be happy if you guys can tell me that my computer will survive it. I've got an early 2011 13" MacBook Pro and an annoying cold. My nose decided that the best time to start running would be as I was leaning over my keyboard, and that's how I ended up with a drop of snot on the left Control key and the area of the chassis in front of it. I wiped it up pretty quickly, of course, but not before a moment of utter fear for the fate of my computer.  So, how bad should I expect the damage to be?  <comment275107> See [this link](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/you-just-spilled-water-or-coffee-on-your-laptop-heres-what-you-should-do/). Unless your snot was very runny, and/or copious, so long as you wiped it up quickly, I'd not worry much. <comment275112> My Macbook is a heavy traveller and it sees more types of coffee, soda and sauce juices than a kitchen sink.  Never had problems with it really. <comment275149> Give your MacBook Pro two aspirin and call the Doctor in the morning if it's sneezing.
