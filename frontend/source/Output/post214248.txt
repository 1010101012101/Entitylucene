Can an 2013 MacBook Air run a monitor at 144hz? <body> Apparently 2013 13" MacBook Air has Intel HD Graphics 5000.  Is it possible to run a monitor at 2560x1440 at 144hz?  <comment258647> Why would you want to run a monitor at 144Hz? <comment258657> It's for gaming. I know the settings would need to be set for very low quality. <comment258665> Don't be dragged in by gamer nonsense. You can't see over about 60FPS. Maybe 90FPS if you want to rock out a bit. 144Hz is completely useless. <comment258793> but @WilliamTFroggard - why be happy with *only* 90 when you can have more? - [These go to 11...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xgx4k83zzc) (couldn't resist;) <comment260924> @WilliamTFroggard - I'm not sure why you say I can't see over 60FPS. I have a 144hz monitor, and there is a huge difference. <comment344132> What happens when you try to run it at 144Hz?
