Making it so programs aren't restored after startup from a forced shutdown <body> Whenever I boot up from a forced shutdown (aka holding down the power button), OSX restores all the programs I had open before the forced shutdown. Is there a way to disable this? If my computer turns off for whatever reason, I want it to boot up fresh.  <answer21234> Log out once and uncheck the strongReopen windows when logging back in/strong toggle.  It should stick and cover you next time you have to crash land your mac.  Do be sure to check this setting in the General preference.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wSMno.png" alt="enter image description here"  Lastly, some more tacky per-app solutions are running around like locking the folders where state is saved. OS X Lion: App-Specific Resume  <comment69463> If by "more tacky" you mean "more robust in the face of crashes" then yes, [that](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/20508/9388) works :-) <comment69464> NO, that is NOT a solution! That only regulates regular restart. Kernel panic does not honor that checkbox. <comment69492> @mee I would say a kernel panic is different than a forced shutdown, but perhaps that's my training and the OP is really looking for a solution when the OS misbehaves so badly that the OS pulls the plug and doesn't even shut down. You could ask a similar question if you are looking for a derivative of what the asker here has accepted as an answer to their problem.
