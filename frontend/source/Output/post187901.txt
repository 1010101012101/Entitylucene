iPad air 2 screen rotation <body> I just got an iPad Air 2. I would like to lock the screen rotation but it doesn't have the rotation lock switch. I also checked this community and tried someone's answer, which was to go to control center. This didn't work because I didn't see  rotation lock control in control center.  <answer187907> On an iPad Air 2, to access the screen rotation controls:  ol liTurn on/unlock iPad/li liSwipe up from the bottom of the screen/li liTap icon which shows padlock with rotating arrow around it - White is on, Grey is off./li /ol  Source: Apple  There has also been a noted issue on iOS 8 (pre-8.1) with the rotation lock. You may, if you haven't already, try updating to iOS v8.1+ should the above steps not work.
