Mac doesn't recognize hosts on local network <body> I have a Linux server in my cupboard. My Windows machines can connect to it via its hostname. I have never configured any DNS server; all I did was assign the Linux box a name when I installed Ubuntu on it. It's running a Samba file server.   My Macbook Pro doesn't recognize the host name. How can I make my Macbook find the machine the same way the Windows machines can? The Linux machine's IP is dynamically assigned via DHCP so I don't want to add a permanent entry to a hosts file or similar. (Despite this, the Windows machines can always find it.)  Update: I can't ping the machine, but nmblookup can find it.  precodegrahamb@pickle:~$ ping fry ping: cannot resolve fry: Unknown host grahamb@pickle:~$ ping fry.local ping: cannot resolve fry.local: Unknown host grahamb@pickle:~$ nmblookup fry querying fry on 192.168.1.255 192.168.1.8 fry&lt;00&gt; /code/pre  <answer14702> I believe what you want to do is to make the linux machine announce itself using mDNS. But then it's not a Mac question anymore, but a Linux question.  <comment15810> nmb isn't in OSX's resolver by default. Though someone else will have to elaborate, because much of this stuff STILL eludes me. <comment15813> I believe what you want to do is to make the linux machine announce itself using [mDNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_configuration_networking#Name_resolution). But then it's not a Mac question anymore, but a Linux question. <comment15815> Great. Even though it may be off topic, would you mind briefly telling us what you did to solve it? <comment15816> On the Linux box: sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon <comment15817> Thanks, after executing "sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon" on the Linux machine, the Mac can now see it as fry.local.
