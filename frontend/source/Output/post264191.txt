Why is /System/Library/User Template protected? <body> Why can't users read code/System/Library/User Template/code?  Is there anything in there that is sensitive and should be protected against reading?  If code/System/Library/User Template/code were not protected against reading, it'd be useful to see how a freshly created user home looks like and to restore parts of it in your own home.  <answer264194> code/System/Library/User Template/code is protected not only by its permissions, but also because of System Integrity Protection as it's under code/System/code  A common troubleshooting method used by system administrators is to create a new user account and see if whatever problem the user is happening is also happening there.  If, for example, a malicious Program were to infect the computer it could use the user template to perform a variety of things on all new users that are created.  It's permissions are not really meant to prevent anything sensitive from leaving, but rather prevent anything malicious from entering.  <comment331053> A User can read `/System/Library/User Template` by using `sudo`, e.g.: `sudo ls  '/System/Library/User Template'` <comment331059> @user3439894, that's what I did, but it seemed too much. Plus ordinary users cannot use `sudo`. <comment331060> Good point, but my question is about it being protected against *reading*, not *writing*.
