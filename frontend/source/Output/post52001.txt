The system preference panes will not load <body> When I open strongSystem Preferences/strong and click on an item it says 'Loading Users &amp; Groups' at the top of the window, but will not load the pane.  I've tried deleting the property list file:   precode /library/preferences/com.apple.systempreference.plist  /code/pre  I also tried clearing the PR and booting in Safe Mode. Anyone have any other ideas before I wipe and re-install?  thanks mcgrailm  <answer52002> Have you looked in the console? Maybe you'll find some error messages there which can narrow the problem down. You can view log files in Console, located in /Applications/Utilities.  Have you tried to check (and maybe repair) the file rights. You can do this with disk utility.  About Disk Utility's Repair Disk Permissions feature  <answer180968> Boot in single user mode (Hold down SHIFT key right after hitting the power button until the Apple Logo appears), Login, Launch System Preferences, Load the Preferences Pane that is not working, Restart Mac OS X.  That worked for me when nothing else did.  <answer285878> Restart, Hold Shift key right after your screen shut down to run safe mode, go to display preferences again to check if is can be opened, and then restart - Done, I tried and it worked on OS 10.12.3.  p/s: I found out this solution of Claeton in this post. Thanks a lot!  <comment59460> yes rean disk utility first fixed all sorts of problems there gonna look at console now <comment59462> logs says "PreferencePanes folder is missing" I guess that can't be fixed without re install ? <comment59463> To be honest i am not sure. Haven't tried to delete my prefs folder :). Maybe you can use Time Machine to restore the folder? <comment59464> ha good point , doubt they had time machine running but thats a good thing to try thanks for your help <comment59465> just checked: directory for system PrefPanes is : /System/Library/PreferencePanes <comment215106> Shift is actually Safe Mode, but the rest is certainly worth a try. <comment319732> I'm adding the text "Could not load Time Machine preference pane.", copied verbatim from the sheet I see on System Preferences when this happens to me.  I hope that will help people searching. <comment319734> After Yosemite, we no longer have Repair Disk Permissions. <comment319735> This does not usually work, but today, the problem did go away when I quit System Preferences and tried again.  El Capitan 10.11.6 on a MacBook (13-inch, Early 2009). <comment319741> Edited to explain single-user mode based on content from Mac Help. <comment366670> While I was able to get back into the preference panel the issue returned again but a few moments later I tried and was able to open Time Machine Preferences. So I can't say this is a resolution.
