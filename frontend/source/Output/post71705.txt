How can I remove a program from "Open With"? <body> I recently installed VMWare Fusion and added Windows 7.  Now when I right-click on a text file and choose Open With, there's an option to open with Notepad in Windows 7.  This is not something I want enabled.  How can I remove this choice?  <answer71706> One solution is to install RCDefaultApp and change the file association for text files.  Another solution is to disable Windows application integration for that virtual machine. To do that open the virtual machine, go to the emVirtual Machine/em menu and select emSettings.../em. Change the settings for emDefault Applications/em. You likely want to uncheck emRun Windows applications from you Mac's Applications folder/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Prxe7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment83276> Looks handy, thank you.  Unfortunately it appears that it's no longer maintained; at least one commenter notes it doesn't work with Mountain Lion. <comment83277> Hmm, I use it with Mountain Lion. <comment83284> Nice, @Hair.  Changing the settings via Fusion is the right answer.  I've been all through those settings, but didn't see that.  Note that a reboot is required for the changes to take place.  Thank you!
