Replace "search with google" with "search with bing" in context menu <body> Is there a way to replace this context menu item to search with Bing instead of Google? I looked under codeKeyboard shortcuts &gt; Services/code but can't find how to change/add this option.  <answer207890> You have to change it in safari :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FybBs.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h3Q6M.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment250811> Good!
