How can I modify activity (health?) data on my Apple Watch / iPhone? <body> I have had an Apple Watch for two years now and have quite a history built up. I am very motivated by the fitness rings and constantly challenge myself to improve my streaks and averages I use the excellent Activity++to view streaks and averages. It also allows me to export a CSV of the activity data. When I view that data, there are several dates reported with all zeroes. A few from before my watch even arrived, and two with dates in '69 (only dates with 2 digit years are shown).  It may seem crazy, but I would love to be able to remove these dates and see accurate averages. The app is simply reading the data stored by Apple, it's not proprietary to the app, so I'm looking for a general way to edit this data.
