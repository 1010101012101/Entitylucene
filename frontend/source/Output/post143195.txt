launchd with high disk usage <body> launchd is producing a lot of I/O activity. In the last day and a half it managed to write 12 GB of data while reading 500MB.  I the logs I do not see anything suspicious. Any suggestion at where could I look?  <answer143388> Try to use lsof utility  precodesudo lsof -p 1 # or  sudo lsof -p $(ps -U root | grep -w "/sbin/launchd" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}') /code/pre  EDIT There are can be other user launchd processes with different pids, run  precodeps aux | grep sbin/launchd /code/pre  To check pids of other instances of launchd.  It should list opened files by launchd. Try to find there something suspicious. Also try app called fseventer it shows read/write events on filesystem, or use app like Grand Perspective or Disk Inventory X to find this newly created huge file and investigate further what it is.  <comment168839> You can use "live" tracking of R/W events of launchd with: `sudo iosnoop | grep launchd`. Some will be listed as *Unknown*, but maybe You'll find some big writes (5th column is size). <comment168842> GrandPerspective is the new Disk Inventory X - http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net <comment168843> Is launchd always running with PID 1? <comment168846> System-wide launchd (as far as I know) always have pid 1. BTW, see edit, there are can be other instances of launchd with other pids <comment168946> Could you edit this to include some details? What version of OS X? How are you measuring the IO of the launchd process? <comment168963> @user1855732 though launchd (1) will still be the parent process of the other instances. <comment168999> Instances of `launchd` are the parent process of __all__ processes on OS X; `launchd` itself does very little but launch and manage other processes. Is it possible the measurement tool is mis-attributing disk activity of a child process with the parent `launchd` process? <comment169012> fseventer is a huge help! Thanks
