What is the format of a .xip file <body> As Xcode 8 beta is available to download, I see it's distributed with a code.xip/code extension, codeXcode_8_beta.xip/code.  What is the .xip format? What's the difference between previous .dmg format?  <answer242987> According to the codexip/code manual page:     A XIP file is an analog to zip(1), but allows for a digital signature to be applied and verified on the receiving system, before the archive is expanded. When a XIP file is opened (by double-clicking), Archive Utility will automatically expand it (but only if the digital signature is intact).   Essentially, an code.xip/code file is just a code.zip/code with a signature to verify that the file has not changed since its creator saved it. This protects from both damage from a disk error and from a third-party tampering with the file.  <answer248838> To my knowledge xip is a xar derivative using gzip compression, with a toc header xml containing checksum, timestamp, certificates, user id/name, creation/modification/access date&amp;time etc.  <answer248841> The code.xip/code file format contains an archive (codexar/code containing a codegzip/code archive and metadata) and a signature of the archive.  To decode an code.xip/code file, use the following commands:  precodepkgutil --check-signature &lt;xip-file&gt; xar -xf &lt;xip-file&gt; tar -zxvf &lt;xar-file&gt; /code/pre  See the following links where developers discuss this format and its implications:  ul liSparkle issue #821 - Add codexip/code support for signed, compressed, application updates/li li“End-of-central-directory signature not found.” when installing Xcode 8 beta xip file/li liTheUnarchiver source code: "Kludge support for XIP files to XAR parser"/li /ul  h2Not for Public Use/h2  Apple has since removed codexip/code from public use. The format has been reserved for Apple's exclusive use in the future, see TN2206:     strongImportant:/strong Starting with macOS Sierra, only XIP archives signed by Apple will be expanded. Developers who have been using XIP archives will need to move to using signed installer packages or disk images.   <comment313785> That didn't work for me for Xcode_8_GM_seed.xip. After using xar, I was left with what appears to be a pbzx file instead of a gzip archive. <comment313830> Apple have removed `xip` from public use. The format has been reserved for Apple's exclusive use in the future – see https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/issues/821#issuecomment-242902676 <comment315283> xar -xf Xcode_8.xip has produced zero files under 10.11.4 <comment318977> So, how you install that file Sir? I am downloading this file now.. <comment322775> Where the command result files stored Mr Graham? <comment322827> If the `xip` can be expanded, the files will be in the same folder as the original. According to @AntonTropashko it is likely no files will be produced. <comment367274> It sure looks like XIP files are varying by date produced, I was able to get a "Contents" and "Metadata" file extracted, with Contents having seemingly raw data that wasn't xz compressed. <comment367282> My first guess would be that the contents of the `Metadata` file indicates the compression used for the raw data. Given Apple have re-appropriated the format for private use, they are able to change it without public documentation.
