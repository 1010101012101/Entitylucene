Applescript-how can I expand a list view window's contents so everything shows hierarchically and expanded <body> Given a root directory upon selection, I need to traverse the directory and all other subdirectories, expanding all subfolders, so that everything shows hierarchically in the finder's list view.  This answer select-all-non-folders-in-an-expanded-list-view-window acts to select all items in an expanded view.   I need to expand all subfolders, until all subfolders from the root directory have been expanded, showing the contents of the root folder and all subfolders hierarchically.  <answer259975> You can expand all sub-directories with an alt-click on the arrow left of your directory. img src="https://i.imgur.com/6j2V8Dq.png" alt="Directories"
