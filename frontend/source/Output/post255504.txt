How to check the VPN setting created by an app on an iOS device? <body> Many VPN apps would create VPN profiles on the iOS device. Unlike VPN profiles create by the user, they cannot be edited, and therefore the user cannot see the setting of said profile. With a jailbroken device, is there a way to hunt down such profile and read the setting in file?  <answer255512> strongYes you can on a jailbroken iPhone using an app called OpenSSH./strong  It will allow you access to all the system files and in normally conditions you can simple change the extension to .txt and open it with textedit for example.  strongWhat youâ€™ll need:/strong  ul liA jailbroken iPhone/iPod Touch with Cydia installed./li liOpenSSH Cydia Package./li liWi-Fi and Internet access on the device./li liMac/PC on the same Wi-Fi connection/li liSuitable FTP/SSH clients like Cyberduck, Transmit etc./li /ul  Here is the guide on CultofMac  Also a link to the OpenSSH Cydia Package  strongBasic Instructions:/strong  ol liinstall the OpenSSH package  ul li(click, Install, Confirm, Close, Back)/li /ul/li liopen Wi-Fi from Settings/li liclick your network's /li liread the "IP Address" field  ul li(example: 192.168.1.100)/li /ul/li liopen Terminal on desktop  ul li(open Spotlight, search for "Terminal")/li liOr if you're on Windows, you can use a desktop terminal application such as PuTTY(http://www.putty.org/)./li /ul/li lirun "ssh root@[insert IP Address]"  ul li(example: ssh root@192.168.1.100)/li /ul/li liwait a few minutes (just once)  ul li(it's generating some crypto keys)/li /ul/li liaccept new computer host key  ul li(if it doesn't ask you, that's fine)/li /ul/li lilog in with password "alpine"  ul li(you should change this now)/li /ul/li /ol  <answer255610> You won't need to use OpenSSH at all whatsoever. The VPN settings are saved in /var/preferneces/com.apple.networkextension.plist file. Open it with a text editor. It's not encrypted. The passwords are saved in the keychain instead of inside this file. You cannot access the keychain on an iOS device and decrypt it easily but you can do it over a macbook that shares the keychain with your iOS device (if you enabled it). Type in your master password to view the saved passwords.  <comment318246> This is just an instruction of the basic tool OpenSSH. How do you use OpenSSH to read VPN setting created by an app on an iOS device? <comment318257> @JamesWayne That depends on the app. Once you have access to the filesystem, you can search for it. I have no idea where it is located, but you should find it on your own. If you want some help, you have to provide a lot more information (like the app and whatever you have found and the file structure). Also, even if you do find the settings, I'm sure you won't find how to parse the file and make sense of those. They may be in SQLite3, JSON, plaintext, yalm, csv ... And the files may be even encrypted! I have no idea and only the developers of the app could say (**IF** it is possible!). <comment348984> How do you read this folder without a jailbroken device?
