How to copy the "Local Items" Keychain to a new mac? <body> I copied my whole HDD from MBPOld to MBPNew, but saw the "Local Objects" Keychain is empty.  I then saw there is a folder in code~/Library/Keychains/code named like the UUID of the Mac. (which can be retrieved with codesystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'Hardware UUID' | awk '{print $3}'/code).  I restarted the Mac in recovery mode (by holding down kbdCmd/kbd + kbdR/kbd) and opened up Terminal to rename the folder from OldMBP-UUID to NewMBP-UUID but still the local objects keychain is empty.  Is there any way to get this done?  <answer219527> FYI: I just managed to get my keys to my new mac (this only works if you still have access to the old Mac and can boot it up):  ul li(on the old mac) Remove your current user's password/li liCreate a new keychain (without a password)/li liCopy all keys in "Local Items" to your new keychain/li liCopy the keychain to the new mac/li li(on the new mac) Remove your current user's password/li liAdd the new keychain file/li liCopy all keys in the new keychain to "Local Items"/li liDelete the new keychain/li liDon't forget to set a password again after that/li /ul  It's a bit annoying as you have to click "Allow" for EACH item in the keychain but well, it's the only thing I found that works.
