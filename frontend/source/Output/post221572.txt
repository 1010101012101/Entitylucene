Why can't I download photos from iCloud onto my computer? <body> My iPhone has 4,000 photos on it. iCloud is only backing up some of those even though i have plenty of space. I would like to put all of those photos on my computer so that I can print and use them for scrapbooking and physical albums.  How can I get all my photos into iCloud?  <comment268457> to upload the photos that were in your device before you used photo stream you'll need to connect your device to iTunes. Also iCloud has some limite on the number of photos per time : https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202299
