How can I get the rest of my pictures off a power circling iPhone 4? <body> I've been trying to get pictures off my iPhone 4. The only thing it will do is turn on and you can see the apple sign and turn right back off or it wont even turn on. I've been to apple a few times but they wanted to reset my phone with the possibility of me losing all pictures. Can anyone please help me?  <comment187109> You don't have them backed up on computer or iTunes?
