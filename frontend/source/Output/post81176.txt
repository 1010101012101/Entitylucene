Mac Mini + Thunderbolt Display+ Additional Display? <body> I just purchased a 2012 Mac Mini to use with my Apple Thunderbolt Display.  The mini also included an HDMI to DVI converter.  I have a DVI-connected ViewSonic montior that I'd like to use as a secondary display.  Is it possible to use the HDMI-out port as a secondary monitor output?  Like so: (excuse the horrible art)  precode     Thunderbolt Port          HDMI Port     /*****************|------|**********\_________    |                  | Mac  |          |         | ---------------       | Mini |          | Other   | | Thunderbolt |       |------|          | Monitor | |   Display   |                         |_________| |_____________| /code/pre  <answer81182> Yes, that will work just fine.  <comment93622> Awesome, thank you.  Accepting as the correct answer, or I'll forget to come back.  Haven't tried it yet though :) <comment93623> if you have all the parts, why not just try and see if it works?.. <comment93624> My DVI Cable vanished, so I didn't want to buy one if it wasn't going to do me any good. It's funny how I can spend $1000 on a monitor and another $1000+ on the Mini... but that last $5 is just too much. ;P <comment93722> Yup, worked like a charm.  Thanks!
