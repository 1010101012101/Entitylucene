Access denied on TimeMachine after formatting OSX <body> I formatted a Mac and installed the latest OSX. This Mac was using Time Machine with an external hard drive.  Now, I am unable to access folders on that disc that were created before the formatting.  In Finder they appear with a red stop icon and trying to open these folders give me an access denied error.  Trying to codechmod/code or codechown/code them gives me an error as well (with codesudo/code obviously).  Here is what codels/code says about one of those folders:  precodedrwx------+ 11 502  staff  -        816 20 ao√ª 19:11 Dropbox 0: group:everyone deny     add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown /code/pre  I've also tried: codesudo chflags -R nouchg Dropbox//code, it did not give any errors but did not fix anything.  Also:   precodesudo chmod -N Dropbox/  chmod: Failed to clear ACL on file Dropbox/: Invalid argument /code/pre  <comment260883> I'm confused as to how you restored toe Mac. Can you give more details on the restore process you used? <comment260885> I accessed the Recovery tools during the booting, erased disk and re-installed OSX. I then upgraded to Yosemite (before doing anything else). <comment260899> Ok so why is there a Dropbox folder you can't open? When Dropbox creates it, it has the right permissions. Did you use a different method to install Dropbox? <comment260900> This folder was just an example, there are hundreds of folders. And again, this was working before the format. So sure permissions were fine. <comment260902> Hmmm ok. That's very weird folders get their permissions get changed.
