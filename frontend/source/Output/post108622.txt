OS X 10.9: Deleting Keyboard Input Sources <body> This is really similar to: How to remove or disable a default keyboard layout? However, I am new here and have no ability to comment or make remarks towards this to voice further problems.  In OS X 10.9, I need to remove input sources in System Preferences  Language and Region  Keyboard Preferences  Input Source.  To be clear, I want these gone completely; if I were to click the add button then I want there to be nothing but the basic English layout available.   hr  **Edit: The solution can be as dangerous as editing near-/root-level files in the OS as long as there's a possible solutions  If no possible solution can be found can anyone recommend third-party software or a way to lock system preferences?**  <answer108632> I not completely sure that's what you're looking for. But if you want to remove some input sources. You just have to select them then click the "minus" button.   You can delete them all but one. There has to be a least one input source. In your case one of the english input sources.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nv4zW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Edit : OP want's to remove all the input source from the list (accessible by clicking the "+" button). And that's not possible.   <answer127979> If others got here searching for how to disable all input sources except a custom keyboard layout, you can edit the codecom.apple.HIToolbox/code plist:  ol liChange the current input source to your custom keyboard layout./li liOpen code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code (in 10.9) or code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist/code (in 10.8 and earlier). You can convert the plist to XML with codeplutil -convert xml1/code./li liRemove the input source or input sources you want to disable from the codeAppleEnabledInputSources/code dictionary. If there is an codeAppleDefaultAsciiInputSource/code key, remove it./li liRestart./li /ol  <comment127317> From @user61808 : No this does not delete the input sources. This just removes them from the list but they can still be re-added via the plus button. They need to be deleted, not hidden. <comment127322> In that case can anyone think of any third party options for locking system preferences? Thusly, does anyone know the root of the input sources to where I could simply delete them (I understand this would be os/root level and is dangerous). <comment127356> System preferences  Security & Privacy  Advanced  Require password to access system wide preferences. <comment135993> Why would you want to do that anyway? <comment172897> if you have Xcode installed, you can directly `open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist` (in 10.9) from a terminal konsole. The items I had to remove to get rid of the keyboard layouts are those with `InputSourceKind` equal to `Keyboard Layout`
