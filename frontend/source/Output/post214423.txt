Keynote 6.6: How can I make an object wider by animation, but not higher <body> I want to animate a block to be wider, but not higher.   from this:  precode____________________ |    Some Text      | --------------------- /code/pre  to this:  precode______________________________________ |             Some Text               | -------------------------------------- /code/pre  The scale animation seems to work only with locked ratio and can't figure out how to do it.   <answer215173> One way to accomplish this is with the strongMagic Move/strong animation.  ul liCreate your object on one slide./li liDuplicate the slide./li liResize the object in the second slide to the desired width./li liSet animation on the first slide to strongMagic Move/strong/li liChange the animation duration and/or acceleration to the desired result./li /ul  h3Slide one:/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/acyuI.png" alt="First slide demonstrating Magic Move"  h3Slide two:/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B63GS.png" alt="Second Slide"  h3Resulting animation:/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wt7dk.gif" alt="Animation"  <comment258947> Looks like it can't do it. Maybe overlaying a black bar (or whatever your background colour is) over the top and bottom of the shape would be good enough? This wouldn't actually scale the text but the background to the text would appear to just be resizing horizontally. <comment258994> I thought on that, but the problem is that my shape has a border line. will try to do it somehow then. <comment259855> Have you tried two objects and a Magic Move? <comment268383> Was this helpful?
