How to connect an iPad to a digital projector <body> What do I need in order to connect an iPad to a digital projector?  I have tried nothing, because I have no idea what to try.  <answer97424> It is actually very simple.  You just need the right cable.  Depending on Projector type you might use the Lightning to VGA Adapter if your Projector is of that type. Note: it does not support Audio!. Look at your Projector to see if the plug looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/evILf.png" alt="enter image description here"  If your projector has HDMI plug use the Lightning Digital AV Adapter  Look at your projector if the plug looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BtgVx.png" alt="enter image description here"  The projectors normally have 16:9 = wide screen (for movies) and you iPad does not, so you will see a black stripe on both sides, that is normal.  PS: if it has both plugs pick the second one "Lightning Digital AV Adapter" since you can use it to plug in to your LCD TV :)  <comment114279> Do you have the digital projector already? if yes, what type of plug does it have?
