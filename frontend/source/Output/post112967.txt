Has someone an idea how to resolve this issue or how to track it down?  h2Edit/h2  Here is all log-information which can be accessed through ⌘L. Unfortunately, the complete list you see below is already printed embefore/em I press the Install button. This means, after pressing Install simply nothing seems to happen.  precodeDec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: LSExceptions [0x7fd8eaa009a0] loaded Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: @(#)PROGRAM:Install  PROJECT:Install-845 Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: @(#)PROGRAM:Installer  PROJECT:Installer-721 Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Hardware: MacPro4,1 @ 2.92 GHz (x 16), 16384 MB RAM Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Running OS Build: Mac OS X 10.9 (13A603) Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/tbb/lib:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/compiler/lib:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/ipp/../compiler/lib:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/ipp/lib:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/compiler/lib:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/mkl/lib:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/tbb/lib Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: TMPDIR=/var/folders/km/9hdvqhk90p3gn3bm1f0xmytr0000gn/T/ Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: SHELL=/bin/bash Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: HOME=/Users/patrick Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: USER=patrick Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: LOGNAME=patrick Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/launch-HOL3Ae/Listeners Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render=/tmp/launch-EpWqi0/Render Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: COMMAND_MODE=unix2003 Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: __CHECKFIX1436934=1 Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Env: __CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING=0x1F5:0:0 Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: JDK 7 Update 45  Installation Log Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Opened from: /Volumes/JDK 7 Update 45/JDK 7 Update 45.pkg Dec  6 17:09:26 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: Product archive /Volumes/JDK 7 Update 45/JDK 7 Update 45.pkg trustLevel=202 Dec  6 17:09:36 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: LSExceptions [0x7fd8eaa009a0] unloaded Dec  6 17:09:38 sheldor.local Installer[12875]: InstallerStatusNotifications plugin loaded /code/pre  <answer125457> You could always proceed at your own risk to install the package using Pacifist, a free download that asks you to donate, as I have done before with Java. It just places the files in and doesn't ask questions, and then you reboot… Really, proceed with caution if you do that. It worked for me on the JDK, but I was in a slightly different situation.  <answer125470> I could solve the problem in the meantime. Some days after posting this question, I tried to install a new version of the Adobe Suite and I noticed that I was unable to uninstall the old version with kind of the same behaviour as described for the Java installer.  Therefore, I decided to make a fresh install of Mavericks. After that, not only the installing issues were gone, but additionally the emFinder freezes/em don't appear any more.  Concluding, it seems to me that making only an update when switching to Mavericks shouldn't probably be done if making a backup and fresh install isn't too much work. Looking back, it would have saved me a lot of time.  <comment132591> Open the installer, press ⌘L to show the logs, then change the Detail Level to Show All Logs. Try to install and see what the log says. <comment132594> @grgarside I have added the log messages to the question. Unfortunately, they don't help very much. <comment146838> Thanks for this answer. I completely forgot to give feedback on my question here, because I already solved it. It seemed that my system was heavily damaged after the update, because what I noticed later was that I'm not only unable to install Java, I was even unable to uninstall the Adobe Creative Suite. Therefore, I reinstalled the system completely and now all those issues are gone. <comment146839> Btw, you get a +1 because I didn't know about Pacifist.
