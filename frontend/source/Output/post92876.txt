Spotlight's cache is huge; can I make it smaller? <body> I forced a Spotlight delete and reindex in Terminal with the command:  precodesudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  Now Spotlight seems to not only constantly index, but also create huge (10+GB) cache files over the course of just a couple weeks.  Is there a way to "reverse" whatever that command did to Spotlight, or simply to fix this excessive caching issue?   <comment108945> Are there any relevant messages showing in Console.app? <comment108988> Do you mean files in `/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V*/*/Cache/`? Have you already tried running `sudo mdutil -E /` again? <comment108991> *"create huge cache files"* is **not** the same as *"caching huge files"*.  Which did you mean?  Please be precise.
