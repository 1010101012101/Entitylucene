How do I remove domains from the network browser? <body> When I go to the network browser (in the Finder, hit command K, then click the "Browse" button, or just shift-command K), I see three domain names from a network I used to connect to six years ago. The appear in a list with dropdown trinagles to the left:  example.orgbr example.bizbr example.combr  How can I remove those? The computer was bound to an Active Directory domain, but nothing I try in the Directory Utility seems to remove them.  This was true on 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, and now on 10.8.  I will not wipe the system and start virgin for something like this that is not causing a problem but annoys me.   <answer66098> When this periodically happened to me, it had to do with permissions being incorrect in the following areas, preventing me from making changes:  In strongSnow Leopard (10.6)/strong and later  ol liOpen code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist/code in a plist editor/li liFind the section codefavoriteservers/code/li liRemove listings for those stubborn locations/li /ol  In strongTiger (10.5)/strong and earlier (if I remember correctly)  ol liNavigate to code~/Library/Favorites/code/li liAdd/Remove the files with the pesky server names/li /ol  Hope this helps
