2011 i5 27" imac wired keyboard does not power up <body> I have tried 3 keyboards and every one does not get power until after OS X starts it's boot sequence, it seem the USB bus is not getting power until about a minute after startup. I am therefore unable to launch diagnostics, reset NVRAM, PRAM and all the other good stuff I need at present because my SSD is dying and I'd like to upgrade it's firmware  Any ideas?  <answer179494> Plug out the iMac (from power) for 15+ seconds to reset SMC.   <comment212767> thanks for the suggestion, I should have mentioned that I tried that already <comment212769> Does holding the alt key work when starting? Maybe a firmware password is enabled and that's why PRAM reset doesn't work. Also try all USB ports and plugging in nothing but the keyboard. <comment212776> keyboard is the only thing there, I could try to disable the camera and bluetooth but then my mouse won't work and I'm screwed. Otherwise I'll maybe buy a powered hub and see if that helps me. Nothing works on the keyboard pre gray screen so no boot combinations <comment212778> Hm, very strange. For your SSD upgrade in the mean time. You can also select your boot device in system preferences  startup volume <comment212790> yes. I guess I could burn the ssd firmware boot onto the 1TB HD, the remains of my failing fusion drive but how do I get back? I'm booting from a thunderbolt Seagate goflex at present which is ok... thinks out loud - I'll build the SSD firmware boot onto a SATA via the goflex on my MBP and then use the goflex to boot the iMac.....
