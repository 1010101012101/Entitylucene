iPhone 4 (iOS 6) keeps unchecking calendar <body> I have an Exchange account that is set to Email, Contacts and Calendars, but for some reason it won't work correctly after upgrading my iPhone 4 to IOS6.  I've deleted the account and added it again, just to make sure I start from nothing. After adding the account the calendar events won't show up. If I reboot the phone, they show up, but after maybe 15 minutes (Which is what I set the update interval to. I've also tried using push), the calender has been unchecked. If I check it again, the events won't reappear, and after some time (maybe 15 minutes, haven't timed it) the calendar is unchecked again.  Any ideas?  <comment92262> I had the same problem and Apple support suggested I reset the device settings Settings  General  Reset, reset all settings. This fixed the problem for a few days, but it came back. <comment92435> @JayKruemcke Yeah, that's what I ended up doing as well, but it lasts somewhere from 5 minutes to a few days. Which is useless. Easier to just sell the damn thing and buy a different phone.
