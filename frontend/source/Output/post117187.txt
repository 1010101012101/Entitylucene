How much does replacing the screen of iPod touch 4th gen cost in India? <body> I have an iPod touch 4th generation, 32GB. Broke the screen and since then it doesn't even charge. I am in Hyderabad, India, and I would appreciate a locally available answer.  <answer118638> Try www.irepair.in also avl @ Hyderabad. Original screen replacement costs approx 5k. Apple will replace the product if it's out of warranty for 9.2k.  <comment138387> This question appears to be off-topic because it is primarily a shopping question
