MAC OS X 10.8.4 Login Stuck on password - Restart logind service? <body> I have a remote MAC that is stuck on the login screen for the local user. The login screen is stuck right after the password was entered. I can login to the remote MAC with ssh and run commands. This MAC is hosting a database for other users so I would rather not restart it if possible.  Is there a command I can run that would restart the core service logind so that I do not have to restart the computer?   If the answer is no, can I restart the computer using sudo shutdown -r now remotely over ssh?  <answer97803> It seems like you could run codekillall loginwindow/code to restart the login window process which should stop the authentication attempt.  And yes, codesudo shutdown -r now/code should force the remote Mac to reboot immediately.  <answer97804> Log in as an admin user via SSH and run  precodeps aux | grep -i loginwindow /code/pre  Look for the PID of the login process of the local user and then do  precodesudo kill -9 &lt;PID of user's loginwindow process&gt; /code/pre  to terminate it.  <comment114781> `killall loginwindow` will log out *any* user already logged in <comment114786> After running the killall command, how would I restart the process, or does that happen automatically? <comment114788> @MichaelA. I believe the process will restart automatically since it's one of the main processes.  This is the case when you run killall on Dock, Finder, etc.. <comment114798> The command worked to kill the process but it did not release the console. I ended up restarting the computer. Restarting remotely also hung so I had to hold down the power button. I was able to shutdown the database program remotely so I was happy about that. Thanks for all your help!
