How do I know what to put in DefaultKeyBindings.dict? <body> I am trying to create a few system level key bindings. I know about code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code but I am not sure what to put in there/or how to go about finding the commands and codes.  I would like keybindings to    ul listrongOpt &lt;-/strong   //Move cursor back a word  /li listrongOpt -/strong   //Move cursor forward a word  /li listrongOpt Cmd/strong &lt;- //Home  /li listrongOpt Cmd/strong - //End  /li li(the same commands, but adding Shift to select instead of just move/li /ul  Is there a good resource to help me figure this out?  <answer127027> I found an application (KeyBindingsEdit) that is a nice UI for building it.
