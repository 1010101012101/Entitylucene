The volume "ok" could not be repaired <body> my macbook air 2011 just doesnt show the login window, after running fsck -yf it shows  precode... Failed to issue COM RESET successfully after 3 attempts. Failing... disk0s2: no such device disk0s2: media is not present. ... **** The volume "ok" could not be repaired /code/pre  So what I could do now?  <answer88943> At this point, the drive either has failed and needs to be replaced or needs a total erase, start from scratch, and load the files and OS from a backup copy.  You might be able to keep running on it, but it's like a bridge with cracks in it - it's best to collect your toys and get it repaired.  You could try a third party tool like Drive Genius or Disk Warrior, but most people don't need to spend $$ and can just do a backup / restore. I'd rather you spend $100 on a new backup drive than software that may or may not repair the issue.  On one hand - you have a backup drive that you can always use. On the other, you have traded $100 to roll the dice and see if software will fix the issue or if you still need to do the backup. You also want to budget for a potential repair, since many drives with this error are failing and need to be replaced. (emAnd you won't know that until you try to erase it and restore to put it back into service/em).  <comment104357> Hi there, thanks for the response, luckily for me I have buyer this drive (256 6Gb from owc) so I have my old 64Gb drive and I replaced it. So I now have the 256 SSD plugged via USB... so I can erase it and see if works... but I have some "important" files inside it... is there a way that I can retrieve them?
