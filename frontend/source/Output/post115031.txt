Cannot ping my IP <body> How can it be that I cannot ping my own IP on Mac OS?  precode$ ifconfig -a lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384     options=3&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM&gt;     inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128      inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000      inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt; gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether b8:e8:56:46:d4:4e      inet 192.168.1.100 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255     media: autoselect     status: active en1: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 72:00:00:df:26:10      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive en2: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 72:00:00:df:26:11      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive bridge0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=63&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether ba:e8:56:64:03:00      Configuration:         id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0         maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200         root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0         ipfilter disabled flags 0x2     member: en1 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 5 priority 0 path cost 0     member: en2 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 6 priority 0 path cost 0     media: &lt;unknown type&gt;     status: inactive p2p0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2304     ether 0a:e8:56:46:d4:4e      media: autoselect     status: inactive  $ ping 192.168.1.100 PING 192.168.1.100 (192.168.1.100): 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 /code/pre  I disabled both the firewall on my Mac and on the wireless router which gives me the dynamic IP on en0.  <answer115032> Your wireless card must not be configured to respond to ICMP requests.I haven't ever had this issue with actual ethernet cards, but instead with routers whos outside facing adapters would not respond to pings in the interest of security.   Can you ping your loopback (127.0.0.1)? My second question would be, are you running any software that would interfere with this (little snitch would be my first guess)?  Edit: Have you checked to see if "Stealth Mode" is enabled? I know you've turned your firewall off, but this setting however has exactly that effect.  <answer115649> Looks like I had some firewall configurations set up by my company. So basically the firewall buttons in the GUI interface had no effect.  This revealed the problem:  precodesudo pfctl -s all /code/pre  Reinstalled the OS, overriding the presets, and problem solved. Thanks everyone.  <comment134680> This is a local address. The configuration of the wireless card has no effect on local traffic. <comment134683> So you're unable to ping 192.168.1.100? are you able to ping your loopback, as well as the gateway? <comment134695> Which IP address are you referring to? People do not have IP addresses, neither have computers, network interfaces do. <comment134697> Yes, I can ping 127.0.0.1 and the gateway 192.168.1.1. I haven't installed little snitch and I disabled the firewall in System Preferences - Security & Privacy - Firewall. <comment134731> Please add a section to the question showing what syntax you are using to issue ping and what the tool says. <comment153946> I think I'm having a similar [problem](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/131042/unable-to-access-simplehttpserver-with-ip?noredirect=1#comment153812_131042). How did `pfctl` reveal the problem? How do I interpret its output?
