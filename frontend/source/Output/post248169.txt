Having to hold links and webpages to open them <body> I'm having to hold and press links in Safari to open the pages - I used to just touch it and it would open. I prefer the latter but how do change it back? I can't find any info online (probably because I don't know the correct terminology to perform an effective search).  <answer248173> Have you checked your settings in General  Accessibilities? For most people, most of the options should be disabled (except for shaking the screen to undo an action which is by preference).  I have a possibility. Are General  Accessibility  Touch Accommodations  Touch Accommodations + Hold Duration both turned on? Because they make it so that you have to hold on the screen in order to register a touch. That seems to fit your context because they should be off in general.  <comment306386> Is this on iPhone or a Mac? <comment306387> Thanks so much for answering. It's iphone iOS 9.3.2 <comment306390> @user194756 I can't think of a way why this would happen. You should just by default tap quickly on the link to open the webpage. Is it pure iOS or jailbreak? Have you checked GeneralAccessibility. Tell us what is turned on in there from the list of options (most should be off). <comment306392> I love you guys! I went to General - Accessibility and saw 3D Touch (which I turned off). Problem solved. It's not jailbroken for info if that helps anyone else. <comment306393> Most importantly is [GeneralAccessibilityTouch AccommodationsTouch Accommodations + Hold Duration] both turned on? That seems to fit you context because the should be off in general. <comment306395> @user194756 wait. Let me post this as an answer so you can accept it. The comments section is not the proper way to answer, but more for clarification p. <comment306396> Yes you're right, they were all turned on. This has been driving me mad for over a year! Thanks :) <comment306398> Spot on! Solved - thanks so much for your time. <comment306400> @user194756 I also thank you for ticking answers that answer your question.
