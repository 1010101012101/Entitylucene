Why aren't my bootable OS X installer flash drives working (or working unreliably)? <body> I recently purchased some Staples USB 2.0 27987 8GB flash drives to create some bootable OS X installers. I have found them to be unreliable.     strongThe problem:/strong   ul liLag on boot. After I tell the boot loader to boot from the flash drive by holding codeOption/code on startup and selecting the flash drive. (takes forever and by forever, I mean 3+ hours before I force shut it down)./li liFailing to recognize the flash drive as bootable (when holding codeOption/code on startup). The drive doesn't show up in the boot options./li liFormatting failures (disk utility will sometimes give me error messages saying it wasn't able to format correctly)/li /ul  Maybe one of ten attempts to create a bootable flash drive results in success.     strongMy Macs:/strong   I have access to three macs: iBook G4 late 2005 which was running OS X Leopard 10.5.8 (which I found in the trash. I think the hard drive failed earlier today. I found the hard drive in my friend's 15+ year old Dell machine and it was being held in with duct tape so I'm not surprised), Macbook Pro late 2008 (this is actually my Mom's but she doesn't use it anymore) which was running El Capitan 10.11 until earlier today when I downgraded to Leopard v. 10.5.8, and the "school" computer which is a late 2012 iMac running macOS Sierra 10.12.     strongMy Install Media:/strong   I know the Leopard DVD is good and works because I used it a while back to install Leopard on the iBook G4 (PPC obviously) and on my Mom's Macbook Pro (which originally came with the disc). The integrity of the disc is good.     strongWhat I've tried:/strong   ul liUsing Disk Utility to restore directly from the DVD to the flash drives. I use strongGUID/strong with strongMac OS extended (Journaled)/strong or as strongApple Partition Map/strong with strongMac OS extended (Journaled)/strong for PPC macs./li liUsing Disk Utility to create a .dmg file from the DVD which I later mount and use to attempt creating a bootable flash drive installer. I always format the drive as strongGUID/strong with strongMac OS extended (Journaled)/strong or as strongApple Partition Map/strong for PPC macs./li liUsing Disk Utility to format the disk and using Carbon Copy Cloner v. 3.4.7 (the free version) to copy the contents of the .dmg file to the flash drive. Carbon Copy Cloner v. 3.4.7 is only available for Tiger and Leopard so I downgraded the Macbook Pro./li /ul     strongThe result:/strong   Only one in ten bootable flash drive creation attempts is a success. These are brand new Staples 8GB USB 2.0 27987 flash drives bought at a local Staples store. What is causing all of these issues? I've deducted that the flash drives are likely at fault. My heavily used 16GB/32GB Sandisk flash drives don't give me nearly the trouble despite being almost 4 years old. Suggestions? I've spend nearly 18 hours trying to do this and it has become very frustrating!  Thank you :)
