MacBook Pro speakers dust <body> The holes of the speakers in the MacBook Pro (the recent model) are closed by dust. Is there a good way to clean them?  <answer286006> if you have a small vacuum cleaner, like the portable ones for cars or furniture I would suggest you try that. Or even a regular vac if your careful.  <comment360805> Have you tried a vacuum or [compressed air](http://amzn.to/2r2w5Zr)? <comment360806> I thought of that, won't it make the dust particles to stick harder and deeper in the tiny speaker's holes? <comment360807> Not in my experience - especially if you use a vacuum.  There are even a [Micro Attachment Kit](http://amzn.to/2r2Juk9) that can be used on Shop Vacs.  Works every time.
