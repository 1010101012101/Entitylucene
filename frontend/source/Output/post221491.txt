Why is the Force Touch "taptic" TrackPad not clicking/selecting on 2015 MacBook Pro? <body> I have a 2015 MacBook Pro running El Capitan with the new taptic force touch trackpad thing. Which, I must add, is fantastic!  However, this morning I started it up to discover it would not click/select anything. What is this madness? How do I fix it? How do I stop it happening again?  strongThings that work:/strong  ul liTyping with the keyboard./li liMoving the mouse around./li /ul  strongThings that don't work:/strong  ul liTouch to click (I had enabled that setting)/li liPress to click (track pad makes a clicky sound but does nothing)/li liDeep press (track pad makes double clicky sound)/li liTwo finger press (for right click)/li /ul  strongHave Tried:/strong  ul liRestarting the Finder/li liRestarting my Mac/li liMaking sure it is pugged in at the wall/li liVigorously tapping the trackpad in frustration/li liUsing expletive language/li /ul  Unfortunately, I had no success with the above.  Previously, there were no issues with the trackpad. This mac is relatively new, I cannot think of any installed software that could be causing this issue. Any help much appreciated. Thanks.  <answer221517> The issue was solved by connecting an external mouse via blue tooth and just clicking around the screen.  This mouse had previously been set up, so it only required turning on the mouse to connect. The MacBook's inbuilt TrackPad then started responding to clicks again and everything works as expected (presses, clicks, and deep clicks, etc).  The cause of this problem remains unknown, therefore I have no idea how to prevent it. Note: it has not happened again since.  <answer224686> Same issue here but I resolved it with a PRAM reset.  <answer244738> Got this this weekend, I was starting to go a little cranky when I saw my 2015 MBP wouldn't click. Tried restarting, to no avail.  At one point, I unchecked 'tap to click', big mistake because I couldn't click anymore, so I connected a USB mouse to regain tap-to-click, but still no trackpad clicking.  I came across this answer from user jbjose80 on Discussions.Apple, recommending instead of rebooting, to strongshut down and boot back up/strong. Sounded silly, but worked like a charm.

Other functions (trackpad, single tap, scrolling, etc.) were working.

Force touch and haptic feedback were back when the system turned on.  subsubDo I recommend this? No. It's an unclean shutdown. Did it work? Yes it did./sub/sub  <comment268206> If you have a more complete answer or explanation please feel free to post it. I may have solved my issue but the question is still not fully answered. Have a fantastic day!
