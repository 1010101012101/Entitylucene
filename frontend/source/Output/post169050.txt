Which generation is my iPod touch ? <body> It has 64gb and its model no is a1367, does anyone know what model this is?   I have tried to type in the serial no but it is saying its not valid. I want to sell this as I dont need it anymore however I need to know what gen it is.  <answer169051> Probably you have 4th generation of an iPod touch (at least google says so)  <answer169052> It is a 4th generation iPod touch.  <comment198479> Did you even bother to do a Google search for `a1367`? About 400,000 items that clearly state what generation model it is. <comment199301> @JakeGould The person stated that they typed in the serial number and were unable to find any information on it. <comment199302> @L.B. Model number and serial number are two different things. A quick search of the model number shows exactly what the model is and what generation it is. There's no need for the serial number aspect. <comment199303> @JakeGould Got it :) Just wanted to make sure.
