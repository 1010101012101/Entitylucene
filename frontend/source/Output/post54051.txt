Sendmail Error on OS X Mountain Lion <body> I get an error when trying to run sendmail. I am on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.  precodesendmail: fatal: chdir /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool: No such file or directory /code/pre  <answer57515> Just execute in terminal  precodesudo mkdir -p /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool sudo /usr/sbin/postfix set-permissions sudo /usr/sbin/postfix start /code/pre  That did the trick for me.  <answer59157> The solution appears to also fix an error in 10.8 where the fax service has stopped sending emails after the 10.8 upgrade.  <answer64433> In order to get rid of all warnings I had to do the following:  precodesudo mkdir -p /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool sudo gzip /usr/share/man/man1/{postalias.1,postcat.1,postconf.1,postdrop.1,postfix.1,postkick.1,postlock.1,postlog.1,postmap.1,postmulti.1,postqueue.1,postsuper.1,sendmail.1} sudo gzip /usr/share/man/man5/{access.5,aliases.5,bounce.5,canonical.5,cidr_table.5,generic.5,header_checks.5,ldap_table.5,master.5,mysql_table.5,nisplus_table.5,pcre_table.5,pgsql_table.5,postconf.5,postfix-wrapper.5,regexp_table.5,relocated.5,tcp_table.5,transport.5,virtual.5} sudo gzip /usr/share/man/man8/{anvil.8,bounce.8,cleanup.8,discard.8,error.8,flush.8,local.8,master.8,oqmgr.8,pickup.8,pipe.8,proxymap.8,qmgr.8,qmqpd.8,scache.8,showq.8,smtp.8,smtpd.8,spawn.8,tlsmgr.8,trivial-rewrite.8,verify.8,virtual.8} sudo /usr/sbin/postfix set-permissions sudo chmod 700 /Library/Server/Mail/Data/mta sudo /usr/sbin/postfix start /code/pre  <answer105802> strongTLDR/strong: Change the codequeue_directory/code variable in code/etc/postfix/main.cf/code to code/var/spool/postfix/code.  strongFull answer:/strong  The codemkdir -p/code approach likely works, but I suspect there's a simpler solution. Fair warning, I am new to Postfix, and this may all be incorrect.  It seems various editions of Mac OS X use one of two root directories for mail:  ul licode/var/spool/postfix/code/li licode/Library/Server/Mail/code/li /ul  These two seem to have been muddled over time. (Note code/var/code is actually a symlink to code/private/var/code, so you often see those used interchangeably.)  From what I can tell, code/Library/Server/Mail/code is a directory that Mac OS X Server uses for its Mail services, which depend on, but are not the same as, Postfix. code/var/spool/postfix/code, on the other hand, is the preferred directory (p. 14)  for Postfix's internal operations.  There are two major configuration files which references these directories:  ul licode/etc/postfix/main.cf/code/li licode/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist/code/li /ul  You're seeing the "No such file or directory error," I suspect, because the codequeue_directory/code variable in Postfix's codemain.cf/code refers to code/Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool/code, which does not exist. On regular Mac OS X (unlike Server), the entire code/Library/Server/code directory doesn't exist. Instead of creating it, try correcting the codequeue_directory/code variable to be code/var/spool/postfix/code.  A second point of inconsistency is in the default settings for launchd, Mac OS X's daemon manager. It isn't necessary to run Postfix all of the time, as launchd can watch a directory for outgoing mail and only run Postfix when there's something to send. To make sure this will happen, the codeQueueDirectories/code key in codeorg.postfix.master.plist/code needs to list the codemaildrop/code subdirectory of the directory in codemain.cf/code's codequeue_directory/code variable. For example, I changed my codeorg.postfix.master.plist/code file to include:  precode&lt;key&gt;QueueDirectories&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/var/spool/postfix/maildrop&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  With these two directories consistent, Postfix should launch. You should be able to watch code/var/log/mail.log/code while you run:  precode$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist $ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist $ sudo launchctl start org.postfix.master /code/pre  The last of these commands kick-starts Postfix, so you can watch codemail.log/code for immediate debugging feedback, but again it isn't necessary to execute on a normal basis. Launchd will run Postfix as needed. (If you are certain you want Postfix running all the time, use the codeKeepAlive/code key detailed in the codelaunchd.plist/code man page.)  <comment66205> Thanks tried that, mail not going out and getting the following error:    postdrop: warning: mail_queue_enter: create file maildrop/609676.26828: Permission denied <comment66269> I had to do sudo /usr/sbin/postfix set-permissions      as well and now it works <comment66614> Chris, thank you for your suggestion. <comment70060> Thanks a bunch, this worked like a charm even though it threw some odd errors and warnings out. <comment73669> I followed  sudo mkdir... and it works. Thanks for the solution. <comment76247> I don't think zipping the man pages is necessary. <comment80210> Zipping the man pages is necessary to avoid this warning when running set-permissions: `chown: /usr/share/man/man1/postalias.1.gz: No such file or directory` <comment83035> This worked like a charm, just pasted it all in and good go to.  Thanks @Jasper!
