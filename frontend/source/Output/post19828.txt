File management iPad app <body> I am looking for some free File management iPad app. It should be an offline file viewing app, with features to open common file types and also extract zip or rar files.  It should be exactly like Filer app, if u have used that, but without any file limitation.. Please suggest.  <answer19858> GoodReader may well be just what you are looking for. However it does not unarchive .rars. But it has great File Management, opens most files, and is just amazing. I use it on my iPad for reading journal articles from JSTOR at uni. Great markup tools too.  <comment21916> Yes, I know GoodReader , but guess I'll have to download the paid version, as the free one has certain limitations...I am lookinmg for some free app.. <comment21921> Ah, of course, I'm sorry, I should have read more closely. But in this case it is perhaps best to brace yourself and spend however little it is.
