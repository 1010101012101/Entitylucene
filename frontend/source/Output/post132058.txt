Mavericks Internet Sharing Ethernet to Wifi suddenly stopped working <body> I'm using Internet Sharing to convert Ethernet into a wifi hotspot through my Macbook Pro. I'm using the latest version of Mavericks, and today suddenly my internet sharing stopped working. I tried looking for people with similar problems using Google but couldn't find any completely similar stories. Things I tried:  ul liset up Internet Sharing again using a different setup (e.g. different channel)/li lichecked /li /ul     sudo launchctl list | grep bootp   in the terminal (found that using Google), but it was set on anonymous already  ul liunplugged my ethernet cable, although my internet on the Macbook works just fine/li /ul  Maybe something that helps: whenever I try Internet Sharing the corresponding icon very briefly appears but then goes on into a icon indicating looking for wifi.  ifconfig gives me:  precodelo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384     options=3&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM&gt;     inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128      inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000      inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt; gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=10b&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,AV&gt;     ether a8:20:66:4b:c1:8d      inet6 fe80::aa20:66ff:fe4b:c18d%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4      inet 192.168.0.6 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect (100baseTX &lt;half-duplex&gt;)     status: active en1: flags=8823&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether 5c:96:9d:91:4c:53      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect (&lt;unknown type&gt;)     status: inactive en3: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether d2:00:12:7b:27:00      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive fw0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 4078     lladdr 10:dd:b1:ff:fe:27:b2:70      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive p2p0: flags=8802&lt;BROADCAST,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2304     ether 0e:96:9d:91:4c:53      media: autoselect     status: inactive bridge0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=63&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether aa:20:66:b4:91:00      Configuration:         id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0         maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200         root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0         ipfilter disabled flags 0x2     member: en3 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 6 priority 0 path cost 0     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: &lt;unknown type&gt;     status: inactive /code/pre  Please let me know if you need additional information!  <answer204285> Try changing the password for the Internet Sharing WPA2 Personal.  I had the same problem where the Internet Sharing icon (WiFi with arrow) would flash for a moment in the menu bar, and then go back to the usual WiFi icon (signal bars.)  Resetting the settings for the Internet Sharing network fixed it.  (I was messing around with some settings files somewhere inside OS X's directory structure...so serves me right.)  <answer214426> For me, this worked:  ol liStop Internet Sharing/li liTurn Wi-Fi Off/li likill bootp (codesudo pkill -9 -f bootp/code on the Terminal)/li liStart Internet Sharing/li liIt asks if you want to Turn Wi-Fi On. Say Yes./li liUp Arrow icon!/li /ol  <comment155203> question: did you change anything on the access point (router)? <comment155204> please use 'ifconfig' in Terminal and report the results here, that will tell you the settings for each network mode. <comment155206> there is also a answer here that might work for you: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/113123/46541 <comment155342> Thanks for your time Buscar, here's a reply to your three questions/suggestions: 1. I did not change anything on the access point 2. I added the ifconfig output in the question above. 3. To be honest, I did see that other post but I couldn't understand how I should use that answer there, please care to explain it to me? <comment246790> I currently do not experience this problem anymore, must have been a Mavericks bug. However, hopefully your comment will be helpful for others experiencing this problem!
