How do I succeed setting sublime text 3 as a default text editor on Yosemite? <body> It's a matter of principle for me as I'm struggling with it for a long time. I had this issue back on Mavericks and now on Yosemite 10.10.5.  brWhat I'm trying to do is to set Sublime text 3 as a default text editor for all plain text files (my target were files with . and without extension, e.g .bashrc).  Here is an extract of ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist after I used this Replace Text Edit as the default text editor advice:  precode{     LSHandlers =     (                 {             LSHandlerContentType = "public.plain-text";             LSHandlerRoleAll = "com.sublimetext.3";         }     ); } /code/pre  In Finder when I press kbdCommand/kbdkbdO/kbd on e.g .gitconfig file it still opens with TextEdit.  Any help would be appreciated.  <answer204330> The best results with setting default applications I have achieved with a little tool called strongRCDefaultApp/strong.  It installs as a preference pane in System Preferences. Open strongSystem Preferences  Default Apps/strong and change all the applicable extensions and/or UTIs to Sublime Text.  <comment245038> Did you read the comments in the cited answer and already performed a dual reboot? <comment246185> What about simply selecting a file of the type you want to change, and do a Get Info, In that window, you can choose a preferred app for the file and also select Use this app to open all such files. I find that choice holds, even in Yosemite. <comment246250> Doesn't work through Get Info on file as files doesn't have an extension, multiple reboots didn't work either. But made it with this **duti** answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/123954/140831 <comment246254> How do you set if the extension or UTI is not known? This is the question <comment246266> RCDefaultApp hasn't been updated since 2009. That's generally not a good sign. <comment253721> Thanks Arthur. Any ideas what the reason for the downvote was? (And its a shame this problem is so widespread yet Apple has refused to fix it. I know for certain they know about it because I filled a RADAR on it years ago). <comment253873> @jww Not sure to be honest. I have fought with this problem for the longest time as well. RCDefaultApp finally did the trick for me.
