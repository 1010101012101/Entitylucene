How to permanently stop "A new iPhone software version..." notifications <body> I jailbreak my phone and therefore can't always update to the newest iOS version as soon as it is released.  How do I permanently remove all notifications about iOS updates?  <answer222034> As referenced in this forum, you can use Mikoto from cydia.angelxwind.net to disable iOS updates, which should stop giving you update notifications.
