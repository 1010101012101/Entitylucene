How do I upgrade git on Mac OS X? <body> I have codegit/code on code/usr/bin/git/code (I think was Xcode install) but it is 1.7.5.4 and I want to use the current version 1.7.7  Is there a way to uninstall that version and use the new one?  <answer28615> You can install codegit/code from source using Homebrew, and just point your PATH to use the new one instead of the xcode/system version.  There's a little video tutorial here. http://vimeo.com/14649488  It's for an older version but it will get you started, let me know if you need more info.  sup(You can also use MacPorts, Fink or the Git OS X installer, to upgrade.)/sup  <answer28669> If you want to use git itself to update git run the following commands :  This can be run from anywhere codegit clone git://github.com/gitster/git.git/code then you want to codecd git/code then run this codesudo make prefix=/usr install install-doc install-html install-info/code  This will install Git into your /usr/bin folder for global use.  <answer72524> None of the current answers will upgrade Xcode git. They will only install a newer version of git.  Xcode have has changed its mind several times about the best git location. Depending on how long ago you have been installing Xcode you will see git binaries at:  precode/usr/bin/git /usr/local/git /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/libexec/git-core/git /code/pre  Even if you update the PATH, Xcode will stick to its version. The only way I know to force it to use the newer version is replacing those git binaries by a link to the new one you installed.   precodeln -s /opt/local/bin/git /usr/bin/git /code/pre  Repeat for the other path. Notice I use a symbolic link, not a hard one. Otherwise Xcode would replace your other installation during an upgrade  <answer72536> If you want a newer git than the one in Xcode then you need to install it, this install should be to another place as if you update code/usr/bin/git/code then an Apple update will overwrite this version.  There are several ways to do this but as noted by @FranciscoGarcia they won't necessarily change the one used by Xcode just the command line version.  The easiest is to install the binaries from the git site.   If you want code then use a package manager e.g. Fink macports, Homebrew.  If you want the bleeding edge latest install from git's own repository.  <answer111693> You can install the latest git using macports:  precodesudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb /code/pre  <comment131324> It's never a good idea to overwrite system binaries.  Much better to install into `/usr/local/bin` or `$HOME/bin` or similar and adjust your `PATH` accordingly. <comment190233> I understand that this might not be the best answer, but why is this -2? <comment314174> Yeah, everyone says "just make sure PATH is in proper order", but that doesn't work with Xcode binaries, it seems. <comment314201> As SystematicFrank said, even if you update the PATH, Xcode will stick to its version.
