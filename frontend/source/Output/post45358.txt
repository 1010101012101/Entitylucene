What does setting Media Kind to Audiobook do? <body> If I change the strongMedia Kind/strong option on a track to strongAudiobook/strong, what does effects does that have on my iTunes library?  How does it change the presentation and functionality of the track?  <answer45359> Jesse Hollington wrote a great guide to Audiobook handling "The Complete Guide to iTunes Books, Podcasts + iTunes U" at iLounge. Basically it comes down to separating AudioBooks from music and providing different sync and management options within iTunes.  Your sync differences are obvious, you get a different sync category enabling you to sync all or selected Audiobooks. One really interesting difference is that on iOS devices, media kind Audiobook lets you adjust playback speed. I haven't tried setting a music track to audiobook and then changing playback speed - might be useful for learning guitar tracks if pitch is maintained.  <answer46180> If an MP3 has its strongMedia Kind/strong set to strongAudiobook/strong (in the strongOptions/strong tab):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9jHIG.jpg" alt="Media Kind = Audiobook in iTunes Options for a track"  then iTunes will do some different things, compared to strongMusic/strong type tracks:  ul liAudiobooks will appear in their own section of the iTunes library, rather than in the strongMusic/strong section. For me, it was a huge improvement to get these items out of my Music library.  /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oagID.png" alt="Audiobooks in the iTunes library"  ul liIf your Audiobook is a .m4b file, you can play it at twice the regular speed./li /ul  The strongRemember playback position/strong option isn't solely a property of Audiobooks, but if you're importing Audiobooks you might want to check that this is enabled.
