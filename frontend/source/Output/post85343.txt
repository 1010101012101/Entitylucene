How can I do a full text search of plaintext files in my DropBox folder? <body> I understand that Spotlight will search the full text of files in any folder and will show files that contain instances of the searched text. But I would also like to see highlighted instances of the searched text within the text file. Command-f in a text editor accomplishes this.  The problem is that I have to perform a two-step process which can be very time-consuming when I have a lot of files to search through:  ol liUse Spotlight to locate files that have instances of the searched text in them/li liOpen each file in a text editor individually, command-f, and locate the instance of the text within that file./li /ol  Is there any way of combining these two steps into one on OS X? Is there a feature of Spotlight I am missing or an app that will do this? I can do this quite easily on the iPad with the search bar in Daedalus Touch but would love to find out an OS X equivalent.  Thanks for reading.  <answer85362> I found an app (paid) that will do the above: SearchInFiles. Disclaimer: I haven't tried it yet.  <answer85419> I often do such search, but I do not use fancy GUIs for that. If you are interested, then read on.  Unix has a great tool called codegrep/code which will search for patterns within files. It even supports regular expressions if you use codeegrep/code.  Example searching the word "hello" with all case mixture in the Dropbox folder:  precodecd /Users/name/Dropbox grep -Riw hello * /code/pre  That is it. Oh, I forgot to mention you have to use the codeTerminal/code application before typing these commands.  If you look for two words "hello" or "bye", you can do:  precodeegrep -Riw "hello|bye" * /code/pre  If you are looking for every words that contains "ell" (such as hello), you can do:  precodegrep -Ri ell * /code/pre  And finally (but read the manual page if you want more), matching every file that have the word "iOS" with this particular case:  precodegrep -Rw iOS * /code/pre  <answer277116> You can try to use Ambar (https://ambar.cloud). It's a cloud solution to search through content of your Dropbox files. Once you connect Ambar to Dropbox it's sync files from Dropbox and allow ultra-fast intellectual search. With free plan you can index up to 2000 documents.  Quick review is posted here  emP.s. I work for Ambar./em  <comment98531> Thanks. I found the grep tool in my own research. Although I don't like 'fancy' GUIs either, I do prefer GUIs. I don't know what I'm doing in the Terminal app. <comment98549> I understand. I can like fancy and non-fancy GUIs, I feel comfortable with all types including command line. So I try to use the easiest tool for each task. I do always have a terminal open ;-) <comment348809> The community here tends to vote down overt self-promotion and flag it as spam.
