iTunes sync podcasts <body> Is there a way to sync iTunes podcast subscriptions across two iTunes installations; one on a Mac and the other on a W7 ?  <answer32613> You can copy the list of subscriptions between them, but I don’t know how to keep them in sync.  ol liIn the sidebar of the first iTunes installation, select codePodcasts/code, right click, then click codeExport/code. I use the OPML file type, but others might work. (Let’s call it codePodcasts.opml/code)./li liUsing a USB stick, Dropbox, or some other method, transfer codePodcasts.opml/code to the computer with the second iTunes installation./li liSelect codeFile/code  codeAdd to Library/code, and find codePodcasts.opml/code. Once you open it, your second iTunes installation will have the same podcast subscriptions as the first./li /ol  Two comments:  ul liThis won’t keep them in sync; if your podcast subscriptions change, you’ll need to repeat the above to carry the changes across./li liThere may well be a much easier method, using something like Home Sharing or Dropbox, to keep the single library file synced between the two machines./li /ul
