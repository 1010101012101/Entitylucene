What happens when two user accounts on a single mac authorize to two different Apple IDs? <body> iTunes authorization is machine based, not user based. So how does Apple handle the situation where same-machine user accounts have different iTunes (Apple Store) Apple ID authorizations?  I'm guessing a single machine can have multiple authorizations simultaneously, but each user account can have only one authorization at a time. (Of course a single authorization may be used on multiple machines -- up to a limit of roughly 5 Macs and sundry devices.)  Can anyone confirm this? I'm a bit reluctant to experiment.  <comment341533> Actually, reading this thread I'm even more curious as to what happens...  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4504983?start=15&tstart=0
