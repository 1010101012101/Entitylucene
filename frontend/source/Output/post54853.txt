Code-signing issue. Getting a Build failed, with no specific error <body> I have just signed up for the Apple Developer Program (ADC), and did all that is necessary to make an app run on the device itself.    emI created an empty project and succeeded in running it on my device./em  I am using RouteMe for my project, and inside my project are several sub projects.br The problem now, is after I build the project, I can run it on the Simulator, strongbut not on the device/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d2vBo.png" alt="enter image description here"  It is weird that no reason is given. Anyone knows what this could be?  Thanks!  <answer54861> Take a look at the build log. This will show the error causing the build to be marked as failed.     strongXcode/strong  strongView/strong (menu)  strongNavigators/strong  strongShow Log Navigator/strong   Within the log navigator, click on the last build. You will be presented with the build steps; control-click on one of the steps and select strongExpand All Transcripts/strong.  At this point, you will see everything the build system did and the output from each command. The error will be within this text.  <comment62893> Questions about programming, development, and listing your apps on the App Store are off topic for Ask Different. <comment63018> Great ! thanks!
