iPod classic 80GB won't charge from usb power adapter <body> iPod classic 80GB 2007 [Model No.:A1238] won't charge from LG usb travel adapter (output 5.0V, 0.85A). It normally charged from Apple 5W USB Power Adapter [Model No.:A1299] (output 5.0V, 1A), and normally charged from macbook USB port and required just 0.5A for charging.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NZaPG.png" alt="iPod current required"  Why it won't charge from LG adapter whose output current (0.85A) actually is between laptop USB port (0.5A) and Apple USB Power Adapter (1A)?  <answer100650> I looked into the amount of current available from a USB charger when investigating how to charge multiple iPhones / iPads simultaneously.  Below is something I learnt that emmight/em be relevant.  There are several different ways that a charger can "tell" an iPod how much current it can provide - the iPod can't determine this directly.  If the charger is a computer, it will communicate this through a data transfer (similar to transferring MP3 file data).  But a simple charger won't use this method.  Instead, there are various standards (some proprietary, I believe!) which specify how much current can be provided, by providing certain voltages at the data lines.  USB has four pins: one ground, one power, and two data.  For example, apparently 2.8V on one of the data pins and 2.0V on another means "you can draw up to 1 amp".  See this link for some detail, although I think some of that is out-dated.  I'd guess that the LG adaptor doesn't provide the signalling that the iPod expects.  I don't know a way to resolve this, other than to try a different adaptor - sorry.
