how to use the + on the numeric keypad for "+p in vim, Mac Os X <body> Under Mac OS X, in vim, when I issue the command code"+p/code using the numeric keypad for the code+/code in normal mode, instead of pasting stuff from the system clipboard Vim enters insert mode and inserts the letters codekp/code.  The same kind of thing happens to me under Linux when I have the Numlock off, however, my Apple Keyboard (usb keyboard) does not have a Numlock key, instead it has a Clear key.   Does anyone have any ideas of how to get around this and so that I can use the keypad for entering the code+/code in code+p"/code?    <answer115672> It’s Vim, feel free to remap anything to anything you want.  To detect what you numpad code+/code sends to Vim press codeC-v/code then code+/code on numpad – you will see something like  precode^[Ok /code/pre  code^[/code is escape, so you may command your Vim  precode:map "&lt;esc&gt;Ok "+ /code/pre  Now it should work as expected by you.  However, it would be better to do this kind of mappings not in Vim but in your terminal emulator (which you have not mentioned) by two reasons:  ul liIn Vim you have to map all possible prefixes explicitly. You can perform code:map &lt;esc&gt;Ok +/code but it won’t affect code"&lt;esc&gt;Ok/code./li liMapping code&lt;esc&gt;Ok/code to something will add a delay in processing single code&lt;esc&gt;/code press (see code:h timeoutlen/code)./li /ul
