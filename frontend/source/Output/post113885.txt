Is there a way to hook up my IPhone to my Windows computer to make and recieve calls and texts? <body> Basically what I am looking for is something similar to Phone Amego from these questions, but for Windows. Also my desktop doesn't have Bluetooth so a solution that works over WiFi or by plugging my phone into the sync/charging cable would be preferable.  <answer113953> Without a jailbreak, what you ask is not possible (Even on Mac OS).  <comment133599> Are there any apps exclusive to jailbroken phones that can accomplish this?
