Mac app store Xcode stuck on install/installing <body> After a couple of false starts trying to download Xcode, I downloaded the dmg instead and succesfully installed Xcode 7.3 but in the App Store, it shows up as installed or installing like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8TwwG.png" alt="enter image description here"  I deleted the download in the Applications folder, deleted all instances of store in code~/Library/Caches/code and the contents of com.apple.appstore directories in code/private/var/code. I signed out and in and restarted. I just want to get Xcode back to it saying get, or is it just not worth the trouble?
