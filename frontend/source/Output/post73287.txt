How can I rollback to iTunes 10? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How can I downgrade iTunes 11 to 10.7 in Mountain Lion?       I really miss iTunes DJ. Its all I use, and I'd like to roll back to iTunes 10.  I guess my Library has been upgraded (didn't see a notices) so I'm not hopeful, but does anyone have a suggestion?   I have a timemachine backup, but thats all.  (I've seen the worthy answer: With iTunes DJ gone from iTunes 11, what&#39;s a good replacement solution?, but I had a groove, and I want it back!)   <comment88512> Does the duplicate answer and question help or perhaps are you on windows and we should reopen this? <comment88560> thanks @bmike, I've made peace with v11.. the awesomely detailed instructions at the linked post are too much for me to justify :) thanks for checking!
