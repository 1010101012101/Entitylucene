Start menu + taskbar for Mac OS X <body> I am looking for a start menu and taskbar for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) with as many following features as possible (approximately ordered by descending importance):  Start menu:  ul liMulti-column application list (i.e. no need to scroll)/li liApplications shouldn't be split into different categories/li lino menu delay (i.e. the delay for opening submenus when the mouse hovers over a folder item should be 0.)/li lishow the X recently launched applications/li liclicking on a non-leaf element of the start menu should have no effect/li /ul  Taskbar:  ul lican be configured to have several rows/li lidoesn't let other windows to go under the taskbar/li lidoesn't combine windows belonging to the same application/li liis not transparent/li /ul  Is there any other great option? I am basically looking for an equivalent of Classic Start Menu (Windows).  It's okay if the suggested application provides only the start menu or the taskbar.  hr  I am aware of uBar but it does not present applications in a multi-column application list, clicking on a non-leaf element opens some folder,  and maximized windows overlap with the uBar's taskbar.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/irthM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   I am also aware of iTaskbar but it has the same issues as uBar: it does not present applications in a multi-column application list, and maximized windows overlap with the taskbar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWa1o.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Lastly, Fantasktik is no longer maintained and doesn't work with my OS X.  <answer220246> You can try this, Start Menu for Mac OS X:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tCnnz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment208671> Why do you want a start menu on a Mac? I use the Dock to keep my most used Applications in and the rest I do `CMD+Space` which opens up spotlight and type in the name of my app then click enter to load it. IMO it is much faster then clicking on the 'start menu' and then looking for your application that way. <comment208696> @aPyDeveloper Sometimes I don't want to use a keyboard. <comment208731> Ah, ok. Finder? (I am aPyDeveloper [changed name]). Also keyboard is quicker. <comment266562> Thanks, do you know whether it has any of the features mentioned in the question? I failed to find more details on the website.
