Unable to determine the Mac OS X version on the targeted disk (-69831) <body> I recently moved my home folder to another internal HDD on my MacbookPro (early 2011 OSX 10.9.4). I'm having an issue where in-app file dialogs cannot display my new home directory or its contents. I thought about trying to repair disk permissions but the option is greyed out in Disk Utility and I get the following error when trying to run it in terminal  precodesudo diskutil repairpermissions /Volumes/Data Error starting permissions repair for disk1s2 Data: Unable to determine the Mac OS X version on the targeted disk (-69831) /code/pre  I also tried rebooting into recovery mode and using the repair option in the resetpassword dialog but the /Volumes/Data disk does not appear, only the main boot volume.  <answer136574> Make sure the strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong  strongAdvanced Options/strong options for your moved user account is correct.  ol liLaunch strongSystem Preferences.app/strong/li liSelect strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong/li liUnlock the panel/li likbdControl/kbd + Click on the moved account and select strongAdvanced Optionsâ€¦*/strong/li liUpdate strongHome directory:/strong to the correct, full, path to your moved home folder./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqK4B.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups on Mac OS X - some details redacted"  <answer136579> This resolved it:  precodesudo chflags nohidden /Users /code/pre  <comment162029> Hi. Yes, this is how I moved my home folder in the first place. Everything seemed to work except for this odd behaviour which prevents me from selecting the folder from within applications. <comment162053> Good to hear you found a fix.
