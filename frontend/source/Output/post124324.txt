Missing Groups After Syncing with iCloud <body> I lost all of my groups when syncing Outlook 2010 with iCloud sync on Windows.  How do I get them back?  <answer124326> If you do backups look for the .pst-file (office identity) and restore it from a backup.  <comment145388> This question is probably going to need more detail for someone to answer it. Are you syncing on a device? A computer? What version of iOS or OSX are you using?
