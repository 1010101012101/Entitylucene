Where can I find statistics on download amount on OSX? <body> I'd like to buy a mobile broadband service, but there's a limit in gigabyte per month I can download.   Before i buy, it would be great to know what i currently consume, bandwidth wise. Is this statisti available anywhere on a vanilla OS X system? Should I get an additional application?  <answer72359> Activity Monitor will show your network usage for the current session, but this gets reset when you reboot. However, if you're just looking for a rough estimate of how much data you use before you get your mobile service, this may suffice. After you get your service, you will probably find that your carrier has a way of checking via a website.  Regarding bmike's answer, I believe he's talking about iOS.  <answer72373> emOSXDaily/em had an article on this very topic. It will answer your question.  <comment84040> Short of tethering your Mac to an iPhone or iOS device that measures this more easily, you might ask the carrier if you could borrow equipment and pay for a metered amount and see how long it takes to burn that first allocation. Then you could buy with confidence. <comment84045> A search for `bandwidth` on the App Store shows as the the top result a free app called [Bandwidth+](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bandwidth+/id490461369?mt=12) that sounds like it'll do about what you want. <comment84058> please summarize the contents of your link so your answer remains valid even if the link expires.
