How can I find out which process causes network traffic on Time Machine volume / NAS? <body> I have a NAS (Synology disk station), which offers  ul lia Time Machine volume/li lishared folders (smb://)/li lian administration web interface (https://synology/)/li /ul  I recently upgraded my Macbook from OS X 10.8.6 to 10.11.  The Synology Disk Station is configured to enter sleep mode after 15 minutes. Since the upgrade, this never happens while my Macbook is running. It used to work before. So there must be some network activity (Time Machine, Finder, Spotlight, Browser, â€¦?) in macOS 10.11 that prevents sleep mode.  How can I find out which process causes the traffic?  <comment318909> So the disk station problem went away after re-installing [DSM](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/). Anyway, I'll leave the question here.
