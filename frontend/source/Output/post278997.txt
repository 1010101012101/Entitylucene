How to differentiate between repeating events in Apple calendar? <body> I have a list of repeating events in my Apple calendar that are set to run an AppleScript at certain times. However, if I happen to be away (vacation etc.) then when I switch my Mac back on it runs all the scripts that did not run while the computer was off. Annoying and long.  I tried to use some AppleScript code that checks that the script that wants to run is the one for today and today only (not for the days before etc.), but I could not find a way to discriminate between repeating events: they all have the same properties!  Anyone has a way around? macOS 10.12.4  <answer278999> You can store the date the script was last run and only run your script if the script hasn't already been run today:  precodeproperty prev_date : "" set curr_date to date string of (current date) if prev_date is not curr_date then   set prev_date to curr_date   -- your existing code here end if /code/pre  <comment351149> It'd be helpful if you included the applescript code in your question (or, if it's too long, a link to it).
