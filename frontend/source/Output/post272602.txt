Upscale video from 60fps to 120fps or more <body> I have some 60fps footage from my iPhone 6 that I would like to upscale to 120fps using my MacBook Pro, similar to the MotionFlow technology used by Sony and other TV manufacturers.  Basically I want to have my Mac calculate the frames that would be between the existing frames and add them in for smoother video.  Is this possible?
