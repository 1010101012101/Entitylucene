Can't establish VPN with Mac Cisco <body> I am trying to connect to Universities VPN. I am using Cisco anyconnect.  That is the error I have:  precodeThe VPN connection is not allowed via a local proxy. This can be changed through AnyConnect profile settings. /code/pre  I have checked Cisco troubleshooting. And modified the file Remote.Access.xml.  precode    &lt;ProxySettings&gt;IgnoreProxy&lt;/ProxySettings&gt; /code/pre  Instead of:  precode    &lt;ProxySettings&gt;Native&lt;/ProxySettings&gt; /code/pre  When leaving the file after the mods I used codesudo chmod 444 Remote.Access.xml/code to prevent changes, because each time I try to make a connection the file changes back to code&lt;ProxySettings&gt;Native&lt;/ProxySettings&gt;/code. What am I doing wrong?  <comment325344> If you are having problems connecting with your University's VPN, have you approached the University's IT department for help? <comment325347> @IconDaemonyes, sure. They say that everything must work.
