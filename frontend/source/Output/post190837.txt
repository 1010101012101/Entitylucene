How can I identify the cause of this SSL error in Safari 6? <body> I was seeing an SSL error in Safari 6.1.6 (8537.78.2) on OSX 10.8.5 when visiting a website, and the debug information provided from the developer tools didn't indicate the source of the issue. The issue was reported by multiple users of OSX 10.8, and was resolved for those users by restoring TLSv1 in the server configuration (config change at bottom of question).  The error message in Safari developer tools was     Failed to load resource: An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made.   In Safari, there was no additional information under the "Requests  Network" tab (which I saw referenced on other answers).
