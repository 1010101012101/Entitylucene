How can I manipulate several security settings from terminal? <body> I want to change these behaviors from terminal:  ul liAuto-login/li liShowing password after screensaver and sleep mode/li liGo to sleep mode after x minutes/li liEnable screensaver after x minutes /li /ul  <answer27059> The osascript command and the System Events application are your friends here. Basically, you will be calling AppleScripts from the command line.  For instance,  precode  sudo osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set delay interval of screen saver preferences to 30'   sudo osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set automatic login of security preferences to false'   sudo osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set require password to wake of security preferences to true' /code/pre  The first sets the screensaver to 30 seconds after the last action; the second disables autologin. The third requires a password for exiting the screensaver or waking from sleep (the settings for the two are linked). Exploring the System Events dictionary will help you put together the specifics you are looking for.  <answer27086> strong1) Auto-login/strong  That one is tricky. The default is saved in  codedefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser/code  But in order to turn it on or off, you need to do it as root.  Set it:  codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser ShortName/code  Delete it (turn it off):  codesudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser/code  strong2) Showing password after screensaver and sleep mode/strong  I've been trying to get that one to work, and I can't  You will see a lot of hints telling you that the answer is  precodedefaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword 1 /code/pre  or variations like  precodedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 1 /code/pre  and that emshould/em work, because if you turn it off via System Preferences, you will see:  precode% defaults read com.apple.screensaver {     askForPassword = 0;     askForPasswordDelay = 0;     tokenRemovalAction = 0; } /code/pre  and then if you turn it back on via System Preferences, you will see  precode% defaults read com.apple.screensaver {     askForPassword = 1;     askForPasswordDelay = 0;     tokenRemovalAction = 0; } /code/pre  emstrongBUT/em/strong if turn it OFF and the quit System Preferences and change the setting using 'defaults write', when I re-launch System Preferences, it does not reflect that change.  I'd really like to know the answer to that one (preferably without osascript, but if there is no other way, I'll accept it).  strong3) Go to sleep mode after x minutes/strong  Assuming you mean "have the computer go to sleep after x minutes" you want:  precodesudo pmset sleep 20 /code/pre  You can also use different settings specifically for when you are on battery (for MacBooks):  precodesudo pmset -b sleep 10 /code/pre  If you want to specify never sleeping when plugged in, use  precodesudo pmset -c sleep 0 /code/pre  strong4) Enable screensaver after x minutes/strong  @Daniel's recommendation worked for me:  precodesudo osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set delay interval of screen saver preferences to 30' /code/pre  You can use 'sudo pmset displaysleep X' to have the display sleep instead of using the screensaver.  <answer56105> h2Screensaver Settings/h2  code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist/code contains the system-wide settings which apply when a user account does not already have a setting for a given feature in code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.MACADDRESS.plist/code.  To write to the system-wide file in code/Library/code use  precodedefaults write Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver /code/pre  To write to the current user's file use  precodedefaults write com.apple.screensaver /code/pre  The value for a given setting in the user's file has priority over the value for the same setting in the system-wide file.  <answer261406> Enabling auto-login using codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser ShortName/code no longer works in macOS Sierra.  Try this instead: https://github.com/xfreebird/kcpassword  <comment30987> The first one worked to set the Screen Saver delay, but the other two did not work. <comment30999> They all worked on my machine. I suspect control panel locking might be the culprit. I'll research this further. <comment31145> It's strange, in fact, that `defaults write … ` doesn't effect the System Preferences app in that case. <comment31146> http://hintsforums.macworld.com/archive/index.php/t-14085.html hmm… the same issue but still no solution. <comment64416> The preference for asking for a password after waking up is stored in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist` though at least on 10.7. It's also the file read by `defaults read com.apple.screensaver`; adding `-currentHost` would read the one in the ByHost directory. <comment64417> And the string at the end was a MAC address in 10.4 and earlier, but it's now the hardware UUID shown by `system_profiler | grep 'Hardware UUID'`. <comment94645> You should note that `delay interval of screen saver preferences` is in seconds even though the GUI is in minutes. So, setting it to 30 may give you unexpected results. <comment94646> Also, version of OSX that have a slider will reflect the changes in System Preferences. Mountain Lion has a dropdown and does NOT reflect the changes. However, they work.
