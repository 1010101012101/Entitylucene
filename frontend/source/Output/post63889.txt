How should I go about restarting a custom Apache install? <body> I'm working on a server that was configured by a former employee and I need to restart Apache.  Unfortunately, it's not the default install and it's in a different place and apachectl doesn't exist and launchctl doesn't even seem to know that this apache is installed or running.  I don't want to break anything and was wondering if there was a graceful way of restarting this custom Apache instance in order to update the configuration files to account for new SSL settings.  <answer63929> Assuming you know where Apache is installed, you should be able to gracefully restart it like this:  code kill -USR1 `cat &lt;apache_dir&gt;/logs/httpd.pid` /code  (Untested, but based on the Apache docs).
