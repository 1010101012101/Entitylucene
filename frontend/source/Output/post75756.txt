Why won't iTunes download HD movies? <body> I'm running iTunes 11 on a retina MacBook Pro, and when I try to download HD movies, iTunes shows me a dialog alert saying "This  cannot be played in HD on this computer." The dialog goes on to imply that I have a choice to proceed or to but the standard def version, but I don't see a way to buy the HD version.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQQtj.png" alt="What&#39;s wrong with iTunes?"  Why can't iTunes 11 play HD movies on a retina MacBook Pro? Where's the "I wanna download it anyway" button?  <answer274445> Open iTunes  go to Preferences  Downloads. Ensure that the checkbox which asks if you want HD footage to be preferred over SD is ticked. Also, check your storage and make sure you are using a screen resolution that isn't too far off from the default. If this does not work, turn off the computer, then press  kbdshift/kbd + kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdoption/kbd, then press the power button (but don't hold). Then once you have done that, power on the computer. Some users who had this bug have reported that as a solution.  <comment87976> My guess is that this computer is not powerful enough to decode HD in real-time. <comment87978> We're talking about the most powerful Mac laptop ever. Really? <comment345048> Is your laptop full of data? <comment350385> This has happened to me before when I try to buy HDCP-enabled movies on non-HDCP devices. Solution was to buy the movie on my iPhone, cancel the download on iPhone, then download on my Mac.
