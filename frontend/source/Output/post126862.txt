Spotlight not indexing secondary drive <body> I have two drives on my MacBook Pro. One is a SSD with the root (/) partition, and the other is a hard drive with a home directory partition (/Users). Both partitions are HFS+ format.  When I make a search using Spotlight, nothing on the /Users partition is searchable, since it is not indexed.  Trying to use mdutil to start indexing the drive does not work:  precode## Attempt to enable indexing and flush any existing index $ mdutil -i on -E /Users /Users:         Indexing and searching disabled.  ## Attempting the same as above to all volumes $ mdutil -i on -E -a /:         Indexing enabled.  /Users:         Indexing and searching disabled. /code/pre  <answer126863> ol liOpen strongSystem settings/strong/li liClick strongSpotlight/strong/li liClick strongPrivacy/strong/li liOpen a finder window and navigate to /Volumes/li liDrag the harddrive to the available space as you can see on image below/li liClick the strong-/strong to remove the disk and it will start indexing again/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHQdy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer126869> Turns out this is due to having the codenobrowse/code mount option set for the affected partition. Removing this option for the partition's /etc/fstab line fixes this issue.  <comment148613> I tried adding and removing the root partition and the /Users partition, and that did not work. <comment148623> You did not name this in the question, did you?
