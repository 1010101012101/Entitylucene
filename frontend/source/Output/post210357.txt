Password prompt diologue box <body> Sometimes, when one is installing a programme, a dialogue box will appear asking for an administrator password to allow the installer to ‘make changes’. That seems fine, but wouldn’t it be easy for an installer to fake this and send the password back to the author (and the IP etc.)? Is there a way to make sure this diologue box is indeed from the OS? (And see what exactly is being allowed?)  <answer210395> I just wrote this Apple Script that tests if:  ol liSecurityAgent is running./li liSecurityAgent is displaying something./li liSecurityAgent lives at the correct location./li liSecurityAgent is unmodified, meaning code signature is undamaged.  precodetell application "System Events"     set processList to get the name of every process     set saWindows to {}     if processList contains "SecurityAgent" then -- does it run?     set saPath to POSIX path of application file of application process "SecurityAgent"     if saPath is not "/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/MachServices/SecurityAgent.bundle" then -- assume this location is protected enough to be geniune         tell application "Finder" to display dialog "There is a SecurityAgent, but it's the wrong one!" with icon stop buttons {"OK"}         return     end if      try -- is it signed         set saSignature to do shell script "codesign -d /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/MachServices/SecurityAgent.bundle/Contents/MacOS/SecurityAgent"     on error         tell application "Finder" to display dialog "Signature broken!" with icon stop buttons {"OK"}         return     end try      set saWindows to every window of application process "SecurityAgent" end if  if saWindows is {} then -- Does it display a dialog?     tell application "Finder" to display dialog "No official password dialog is opened." buttons {"OK"} with icon stop     return end if end tell  display dialog "Seems legit." with icon note buttons {"OK"} /code/pre/li /ol  <comment253911> Similar: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/229064/how-to-tell-if-console-login-is-genuine
