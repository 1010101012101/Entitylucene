Auto pairing MacBook with iPhone (networksetup) <body> I'm trying to automatically tether my MacBook to my iPhone (the laptop is too old to make use of Apple's proprietary features in this regard), but I can't seem to figure out how to make this happen via the terminal.  The obvious way to connect to wireless networks is   precodenetworksetup -setairportnetwork NETWORK_NAME NETWORK_PASS /code/pre  When I call this with my credentials, however, I get     Nick's iPhone is not a Wi-Fi interface.br   ** Error: Error obtaining wireless information.   Are there any alternate ways to connect to networks? From what I can tell I can't do it with code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport/code. Does anyone have experience with this?
