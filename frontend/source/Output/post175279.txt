Hide Shared Network Drive in Finder <body> Is there any way to hide a shared network drive in Finder? I don't want to hide all shared drives, just one. I am using an NAS server for backup purposes and I don't want users to be able see or eject the drive in Finder. I know how to hide mounted network shares with chflags, but I want to hide the drive too.  <answer190615> The only way I found so far is to map the share manually to /Volumes/.hiddensharename.  <comment302867> Is this still the case?  I'm having a similar issue.
