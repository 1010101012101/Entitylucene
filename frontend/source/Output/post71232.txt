How do I find what packages I've installed via terminal? <body> I've been learning the shell for a few weeks and have installed several packages. I know/remember what some of them are, like oh-my-zsh and emacs 24 (which was a nightmare to upgrade to), but not sure sure about what else. I've used different methods like curl, wget and Macports.  My question is, if and when I want to do a clean installation of MacOS, how do I backup or script a fresh installation of these packages? In other words, when I do a new install of MacOS I won't be restoring from Time Machine using Migration Assistant: rather I'll install the system and manually restore files. How do I know the installation paths and dependancies of what I've installed in my previous installation using the command line? Is there a txt file somewhere that the system maintains to keep track of what has been installed?

If you want a list of the binaries your terminal has access to, you can run the following commands to check the most common spots, and output the result as a text file:  precodetouch ~/Binaries.txt ls /usr/bin &gt; ~/Binaries.txt ls /usr/sbin &gt;&gt; ~/Binaries.txt ls /usr/local/bin &gt;&gt; ~/Binaries.txt ls /usr/local/sbin &gt;&gt; ~/Binaries.txt ls /opt/local/bin &gt;&gt; ~/Binaries.txt ls /opt/local/sbin &gt;&gt; ~/Binaries.txt /code/pre  Alternatively, if you just want to get the packages installed by MacPorts, run the following (strongthis is probably the one you want/strong):  precodetouch ~/MacPorts.txt port installed &gt; ~/MacPorts.txt /code/pre  And for Homebrew:  precodetouch ~/HomeBrew.txt brew list &gt; ~/HomeBrew.txt /code/pre  And finally, for all packages installed by Installer  precodetouch ~/InstalledPackages.txt pkgutil --packages &gt; ~/InstalledPackages.txt /code/pre  To restore, for example, your MacPorts ports from the list generated above, use the following:  precode port install $(cat ~/MacPorts.txt) /code/pre  <comment82747> This is an excellent answer, thank you. <comment82772> No problem! Please mark it as accepted if it solves your problem :) <comment84459> Isn't it better to run `port list requested` rather than `port installed`, so that MacPorts installs only the dependencies that are in use and in the right order?
