How to reset to default permissions <body> During development and debugging I have changed permissions of various files and folders using chown and chmod on my local system (I didnt maintain the list of changes). Now that I have fixed the issue, i fear of security consequences. Any way I could restore the default permissions and/or find vulnerabilities in terms of network security or other potential loop holes that might create due to my changes.  <answer239964> For system installed packages you can run the following command in Terminal.app to find permissions that differ from the default:     sudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs /   If you want to just apply those permissions to your system as a whole, run the following command:     sudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --verify --standard-pkgs /   Or you could individually fix the permissions that you have changed yourself using chmod/chown.  For everything else, you need to have used either a package manager that can verify permissions, or have a backup you can use for comparing permissions before and after the event.  <answer239965> It depends on your OS.  strongYosemite/strong  ul liUse Disk Utility to reset System permissions.  /li liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLs using OnyX  - Maintenance tab/permissions, tick the box at the top then Execute.  /li liFor belt &amp; braces, apply [or-reapply if already up to date] 10.10.5 using the 10.10.5 combo update, not the delta from App Store/li /ul  strongEl Capitan/strong  ul liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLsbr This has become more complex since El Capitan because of System Integrity Protection, but is still possible by booting to Recovery Mode...    ol liAt boot, hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd R /kbd at the chimes/li liAt the recovery screen, open Terminal from the Utilities menu.  /li liType in coderesetpassword/code and hit Return\Enter.

However, that will only verify, to fix you'd need `sudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs /` <comment294777> This answer is not correct, as this will only fix permissions on the user's home folder. As the question is related to security, networking, etc. - it is vital to check the permissions on systems folders as well. In addition, the question specified El Capitan, so the answer for Yosemite cannot be used there. <comment294778> @jksoegaard I didn't spot that el cap was tagged - tbh, mentioning it in the tag only is not the accepted AD method, it should also be in the question body. However - re-applying the combo update will fix system perms, which makes the answer actually correct ... & more complete than verifying system perms only. <comment294888> No, it actually doesn't. Applying the combo update will only fix permissions for the stuff included in the combo update. All other installed packages (i.e. optional packages, packages from third parties, etc.) would not have their file permissions fixed with the combo update. With the repair_packages command I wrote about, any changed permissions would be shown for files coming from a package install. <comment294889> Yes, I'm aware that it only shows the changes. This was intentional as the user did manually change some permissions, so I assumed he would be able to tell afterwards which of the changes were due to his own actions, and which were already changed before he did his thing. But I'll include it in the answer!
