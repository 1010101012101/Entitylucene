Diff application with posibility to input text manually <body> Is there some application, which allows you to open just 2 blank panes and paste there text manually, so I don't have to save them into files before comparing them and I can edit files directly in panes?  And I would like comparison like Kaleidoscope or something similar, which can hilight what's different in particular line, not just hilight that this line was changed and I have to spot the difference manually  Meld for Linux is capable of doing so, but I didn't find any native apps for Mac  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Etwao.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer65818> If you can't find an alternative to codemeld/code, consider installing it via MacPorts:  precodesudo port install meld /code/pre
