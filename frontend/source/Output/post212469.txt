Mail Script that moves messages with download links to a folder <body> I am a music supervisor and I receive lots of emails with links to download new music.  I'd like to sort these into their own folder automatically.  Is there anyway to sort emails that have links to certain websites like box.com or dropbox?  I would sort them by the person that sends them but then I'd miss the personal emails that they send me as well.  Any suggestions of how this could be done?  <answer212602> I assume you're wanting to use a trigger in mail to triage messages as they come in. You will create a local mailbox named "Music" or whatever, and then set the mailbox property of the message to "Music" if its source data contains any of the trigger URLs. Set up the rule using a script like this:  precodeproperty urlList : {"box.com", "dropbox.com"}  using terms from application "Mail"     on perform mail action with messages theSelectedMessages for rule theRule         repeat with thisMessage in theSelectedMessages             set theSource to source of thisMessage             repeat with thisURL in urlList                 if thisURL is in theSource then                      set mailbox of thisMessage to mailbox "Music"                     exit repeat                 end if             end repeat         end repeat     end perform mail action with messages end using terms from /code/pre
