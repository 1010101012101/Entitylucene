Unable to boot from USB Mac <body> I am running OS X 10.9.2 on a late 2011 Macbook Pro. I created a Windows 7 install usb using bootcamp successfully but the startup screen is not recognizing the usb on reboot. Please help.  Note: I had to create a 30 GB windows partition manually as the bootcamp option for the same was disabled.  <answer122755> According to this Apple Support Communities thread, some USB drives don't work.     Not all USB sticks allow you to make them bootable (apparently).  I initially tried one stick = no luck, so I had this other novelty 8GB stick that looks like a little Darth Vader (I bought it mainly for its looks), however I tried to use Bootcamp setup to make this USB stick bootable and it worked!   Try with a different drive to see if that works.
