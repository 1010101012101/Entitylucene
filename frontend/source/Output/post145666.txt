How can I test a display resolution that's not listed? <body> I'm planning to give a talk at a conference, and I've been told that slides will be displayed on a screen with a resolution of "2048 x 1080 (16:9 aspect ratio)".  I want to see how my slides look at that resolution. I have a Macbook Pro (non-retina screen) running OSX Mavericks and no external display.  In System Preferences, I can choose between only two "scaled" resolutions: 1280 x 800 and 1024 x 640.  Is there a way that I can use an unlisted resolution?  <answer145668> To see all graphics supported modes use the kbdalt/kbd key before clicking on Scaled in display preferences.  To see it in 19:9 use a Thunderbolt cable to a TV. (assuming you have those)  If you have a Mac like I do (MBA 2012) then using the Thunderbolt you can get up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on your HDTV.  precodeIntel HD Graphics 4000 Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors /code/pre  <comment171689> hold the "alt" key before checking (clicking) the display modes, it should come up with all supported resolutions <comment171690> If you have a TV and Thunderbolt cable test it on it. at least for the size. <comment171691> @Buscarì›ƒ That's awesome! Unfortunately, the resolution I want isn't listed. <comment209539> Is this still applicable when using Yosemite 10.10.1? I'm not seeing any changes when holding down Alt before clicking Scaled <comment209540> I would not know. I do not have Yosemite. <comment247730> You should hold "options" when clicking Scaled in the display preferences on Yosemite to see the full list of available resolutions.
