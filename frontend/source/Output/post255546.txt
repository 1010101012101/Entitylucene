How to find "file-release" in OS X El Capitan 10.11.6? <body> I can not find file-release through command line on OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6. On my virtual machine in Ubuntu I can do "ls /etc/*release" and it shows me two files with all needed information:  precode$ cat /etc/redhat-release  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.0 (Maipo)  $ cat /etc/os-release  NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" VERSION="7.0 (Maipo)" ID="rhel" ID_LIKE="fedora" VERSION_ID="7.0" PRETTY_NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.0 (Maipo)" /code/pre  No idea how to find the file with release information on Mac. Please give me a hint or a hint how to search it?  <answer255551> The file(s) code/etc/*release/code contain OS specific informations like distribution name and version mainly in Linux distributions.   One of the purpose of the file(s) is to help software to detect the distribution type.  A file which contains similar informations doesn't really exist in OS X/macOS but can be mimicked with the following shell script:  precode#!/bin/sh  OS=`uname -s` REV=`uname -r` MACH=`uname -m` if [ "${OS}" = "Darwin" ]; then     OIFS="$IFS"     IFS=$'\n'     set `sw_vers` &gt; /dev/null     DIST=`echo $1 | tr "\n" ' ' | sed 's/ProductName:[ ]*//'`     VERSION=`echo $2 | tr "\n" ' ' | sed 's/ProductVersion:[ ]*//'`     BUILD=`echo $3 | tr "\n" ' ' | sed 's/BuildVersion:[ ]*//'`     OSSTR="${OS} ${DIST} ${REV}(SORRY_NO_PSEUDONAME ${BUILD} ${MACH})"     IFS="$OIFS" fi echo ${OSSTR} /code/pre  Executing the script in my system will yield:  precodeDarwin Mac OS X 13.4.0(SORRY_NO_PSEUDONAME 13F1911 x86_64) /code/pre  hr  In OS X/macOS the file is not needed because the requirements of a software package are determined by other means:  ul liInfo.plist in an installer app (e.g. emInstall macOS Sierra.app/em requires LSArchitecturePriority=x86_64 or LSMinimumSystemVersion=10.7)/li lipreflight scripts in an installer packages which use codesw_vers/code or similar commands to determine the OS version./li /ul  <answer255553> Setting aside that linux has a different release structure than macOS - you can use the native tool and files to catalog macOS versions for all OS X prior to 10.12 as well:  precode /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist /code/pre  And the manual page for codesw_vers/code documents the above as the source for build and OS naming.  precode$ sw_vers ProductName:    Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.12 BuildVersion:   16A323 /code/pre  Also, the javascript documentation seems a little more detailed if you don't need a bash / shell / command tool: https://developer.apple.com/reference/installerjs/system
