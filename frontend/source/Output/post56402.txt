How can I remove old SMB connections? <body> Whenever I start up my old Mac Mini, I get an error indicating that it can't connect to an SMB share that I set up a long time ago:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I3kTS.png" alt="Non-existent SMB connection error"  So that this question is findable via Google, the text of this error message is:     strongConnection failed/strong      The server "PROSECCO.STUDY.LOCAL" may not exist or is unavailable at this time.  Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try again.   I'd like to remove this connection, so that the Mac never tries to connect to the Samba share on the other (long-since expired) computer, but I can't find where to do this.  Can anyone tell me how to do this?  (The share doesn't appear in the Finder anywhere that I can find, and it's not shown anywhere under codeSystem Preferences ... -&gt; Networking -&gt; Advanced.../code)  (This Mac Mini runs Mac OS X 10.6.8, and is one of the models that isn't upgradeable to Lion.)  <answer56414> It depends on how this was set up to launch.  From boot, Go  Connect to Server  (click the dropbox) and select clear recent servers, if not using any.  Then go to System Preferences  Accounts and see if there is something set up in the Login Items tab related to the server and clear.  Restart and test.  If it continues I'd check Macintosh HD  Library  LaunchDaemons for a file related to mounting the server.  <answer56417> A user's SMB configurations can usually be located in:  precode~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf /code/pre  <answer101510> Here's how I solved this problem - the scorched earth method - find all preference files with the server name and remove them.    Replace server_name with the name of the server giving you grief, replace file_name with the name of the preference files you find:  ol liin a terminal:  precodecd ~/Library/Preferences/ sudo grep -R "server_name" . /code/pre/li lifor each file returned:   precodemv file_name ~/Desktop/ /code/pre/li lirestart/li lirejoice/li /ol  <answer249242> Go to the finder, keep going up by "cmd + up arrow" till you reach this screen  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nsHQL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now right click and Eject.  <comment64763> Thanks for your answer, but I'm afraid that file doesn't exist - in fact, `find ~ -iname '*smb*'` doesn't find anything... <comment64764> There was nothing listed under "Recent servers" (and no "Clear Recent Servers" option), but under the Login Items tab of `System Preferences  Acounts`, there was one with "Item" `MARK` and "Kind" `Unknown`.  I removed this by clicking the `-` button, and on restarting I no longer get the error!  Many thanks for your help. <comment259325> I'm unable to remove it for myself  - likely due to a server profile that was added that is no longer enabled.   :( <comment298015> "Accounts" is now "Users and Groups"
