How do I connect a late 2013 MBP Retina to two DVI monitors? <body> I thought this Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter would allow me to connect two of these monitors to my Retina MBP.  Does "Dual-Link" mean that two monitors could be connected?  It had not occurred to me to question that before I bought the adapter.  <answer127332> The Dual Link DVI adaptor is for connecting screens ~30" â€“ not for connect multiple screens.  You would need to connect one via the Thunderbolt port and one via the HDMI port.
