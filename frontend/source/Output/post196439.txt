Impact of Spotlight search information removal on Keynote presentation <body> OS X Spotlight search information was removed. What does this mean for my Keynote presentation made in iWork '09?  <answer196440> Nothing. The file's contents won't be modified by the deletion of the Spotlight index. It's still in the location that you saved it to.  <comment234644> I've attempted to edit the title to clarify the question based on the body, but feel free to edit further.
