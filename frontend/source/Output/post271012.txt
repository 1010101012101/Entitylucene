iPhone 5s deleted iMac emails while charging <body> I got a new (used) iPhone 5s. The first time I plugged it into my computer to charge, it wiped out all my sent emails except the past 5 days and it wiped out all my draft emails (100+). Why did this happen and how do I get it back? This isn't the first time an iPhone has wiped out my emails on my iMac. I don't know why this is happening.  <comment340648> You're going to need to provide more details. At present it's not clear why connecting your iPhone to your iMac would result in anything like this. (1) Do you happen to know whether you have a POP or IMAP email account? (2) Was iTunes running on your iMac when you connected your iPhone? (3) Is the same email account also set up on your iPhone? (4) What version of macOS are you running on your iMac? (5) What version of iOS are you running on your iPhone? (6) What email software are you using on your iMac and your IPhone?
