iPhone iCalendar erased quiet a few things in my calendar! <body> Noticed last week that several long message reminders were missing from my iCalendar that I have been keeping for quiet a long time and simply moving as I procrastinated! Tried to get help but could only go back to April 25? and couldn't find anything so I guess it was before that... today I realized that even MORE was erased and I'm pissed! What happened?? How can I recover my iCalendar messages from many times over several days??  <comment358789> Welcome to Ask Different.  It helps if you provide the iPhone model and the iOS version you are running.
