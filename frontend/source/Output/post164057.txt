Cmd-` with full-screen windows on one monitor <body> kbdCommand/kbd-kbd`/kbd switches between windows of the active app, but it doesn't work if the windows are full-screen.  According to this question, this was added in Yosemite if the windows are on separate monitors. Great!  Is there any keyboard shortcut that switches between full-screen windows on a single monitor?  <answer164070> I have outlined below what you should do. In short, strongemyes/em/strong it is possible, because I use it everyday  ol liGo to System Preferences → Keyboard → 'Shortcuts' tab./li liClick on the 'Mission Control' option in the left sidebar./li liNow on the right sidebar you will see a Mission Control heading with a disclosure triangle next to it. Click on the triangle to show additional options./li liYou will see predefined options for you to select from; however, the keyboard shortcuts can be edited as necessary. I have mine set to kbdCommand/kbd-kbd→/kbd to switch between spaces./li /ol  Visual aid: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NaoPu.png" alt="Screenshot of Keyboard Shortcuts preferences with steps labeled"  strongIf this doesn't work for you, it's because you don't have your displays segregated./strong If you're running more than one monitor:  ul liGo to System Settings  Mission Control and check 'Displays have separate Spaces'./li liYou will have to log out and log back in for it to take effect./li /ul  Additionally, for further desktop organization you can set your apps to only appear on a certain window or space, so that way that application only populates in the space you designate. You can do this by going to System Preferences → Mission Control and check "Group windows by application" so there isn't cluttering of applications.  strongNOTE/strong  This is not OS specific (works with Mavericks or Yosemite) and is not prejudiced to full screen apps. In other words, since you're switching spaces it doesn't matter what's in the space or how it's displayed; it will switch regardless. Lastly, it functions regardless of your screen output, setup, or format. I have three monitors and it only affects the active display.   <answer164367> To summarize the set of keyboard shortcuts with the addition of @soulshined's input:  ul liIf I have two windows from emdifferent/em apps I can switch with kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbdTab/kbd./li liIf I have two windows from emthe same/em app I can switch with kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbd`/kbd./li liIf I have two emfull-screen windows/em from the same app then kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbd`/kbd doesn’t work, but I can switch with kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd-kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd (or kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd-kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd; I chose kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd-kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd to avoid conflict with browser back/forward shortcuts)./li liIf I have two full-screen windows from the same app emon different monitors/em then kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd-kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd doesn’t work but kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbd`/kbd does./li liIf I have two full-screen windows from the same app on different monitors emand the target window is currently not in front/em then kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbd`/kbd and kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd-kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd both fail to work. I have to kbd⌘ Command/kbd-kbdTab/kbd to another app that is on the target monitor, then kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd-kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd  to the target window. emCorrection/em: kbd⌃ Ctrl/kbd-kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd scrolls through spaces on the strongemoriginal/em/strong monitor, not the target monitor, so there's actually no way to do this that I know of./li /ul  Aside: if I enable the keyboard shortcuts for “Switch to Desktop 1” and “Switch to Desktop 2” and use two monitors, the shortcuts won’t work if the specified desktop is not assigned to the current monitor.  I've entered a usability bug with Apple, number 19363102.  <comment192676> Great suggestion, @soulshined. <comment192678> @AshleyG  Thanks. It doesn't emulate the command but if both windows of the same application are full screen and in different spaces it essentially emulates the effect. <comment192692> Exploring this a bit more I've found a situation where I can't get a window visible using keyboard shortcuts. I've summarized everything in a new answer as comments don't allow the length and formatting required.
