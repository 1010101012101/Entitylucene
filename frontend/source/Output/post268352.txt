How to use 'cut' with null delimiter <body> This question basically is exactly the same as this question in Stackoverflow.  Using the syntax of codecut/code the specification codecut -d '' file/code should actually work and (given the answers to the question) it seems to work on Linux systems. However, on Mac Os X I get codecut: bad delimiter/code.  My question is: strongis there a way to specify a null delimiter in codecut/code on Mac Os X?/strong  (I know that one could just something else than codecut/code but I am just wondering now ...).  <answer268353> The standard codecut/code on macOS doesn't support this, but you can get the GNU version (which does) by installing codecoreutils/code through Homebrew.
