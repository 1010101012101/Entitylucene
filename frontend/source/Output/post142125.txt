MacBook Air: Two external displays using CadDigit Thunderbolt Station <body> I need to connect two external displays to my 2013 Macbook Air. Each external display has  one VGA port and one DVI port. After some search, I found that my best option is the CalDigit Thunderbolt express. This is because I can use one Thunderbolt port (with a VGA adapter) and the HDMI port (with a DVI adapter). However, I'm not sure if this configuration works because I read that there was a hardware limitation to the thunderbolt. My configuration will be as follows:  precode                                                  |-&gt;Thunderbolt-to-VGA &lt;-&gt; ext disp 1 Macbook Air &lt;--&gt; Thunderbolt Cable &lt;-&gt; CalDigit &lt;-|                                                     |-&gt;Belkin HDMI-to-DVI &lt;-&gt; ext disp 2 /code/pre  My questions are:  ul liIs this configuration possible? /li liIf yes, will there be any performance or speed issue?/li liIf No, what is my best alternative to us two external displays with my macbook air?/li /ul
