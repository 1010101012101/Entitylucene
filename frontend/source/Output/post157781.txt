How can I stop synchronization between chrome on PC and safari on iPhone? <body> For the first time I opened iCloud on my PC. All of the bookmarks in Chrome are synchronized to Safari on my iPhone. I don't want this. And when I delete from Safari, I don't want the deletion to sync with Chrome.   How can I stop synchronization?  Another thing, how can I see how much space bookmarks, favorites take on iPhone?  <answer157802> Uncheck Bookmarks in the iCloud control panel.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GRE3s.png" alt="enter image description here"  &amp; point 2... not much at all; wouldn't worry about it.  <comment271585> Sounds easy.  But how do you open the iCloud panel?  I don't see an iCloud app icon or menu anywhere. <comment271626> Get it from http://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/pc.html if you don't already have it
