Users application shared data <body> I have an application which requires some data to be shared between multiple users who may use a machine.  I understand there is a /Library/Application Support/ directory where shared information can go. Is this the correct place for application shared files.  How do I write to this file on application install? I have a Objective C plugin but I dont seem to be able to write. I think it could be something to do with new permissions on the Library folder.
