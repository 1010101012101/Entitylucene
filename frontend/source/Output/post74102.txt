Lauchd - Run task multiple times between time interval <body> I want to run a script every 15 minutes between 12:00 AM and 4:00 AM.  Is there a way to do that with launchd?  I know you can specify and array of dictionaries using StartCalendarInterval to accomplish this, but I would like to easily be able to change the interval if I so desire.  I was thinking something along the lines of combining StartCalendarInterval with StartInterval, but I don't know how I would specify a stopping time.  The other alternative is to check the time in my script I'm running, but once again, I think I'd rather use launchd to accomplish the task in case I want to add more scripts.  I'm pretty sure this can be done with cron as well (We could put it here for reference if anyone knows how), but I want to stick with launchd since Apple seems to be phasing out cron.  <answer74114> You can print the StartCalendarInterval dictionaries with something like this: codefor h in {0..4}; do for m in {0,15,30,45}; do echo "&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;$h&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;$m&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;key&gt;Second&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;"; done; done/code.  You could also run the script every 15 minutes but exit it depending on the time:  precodeh=$(date +%-H) m=$(date +%-M) [[ $h -gt 4 || $h -eq 4 &amp;&amp; $m -ne 0 ]] &amp;&amp; exit /code/pre  Or run codeEDITOR=nano crontab -e/code and add a line like code*/15 0-4 * * * ~/bin/script/code.  <comment91879> +1 for this because vi was set as my default editor and kept failing to save the crontab file. Error was `crontab: "/usr/bin/vi" exited with status 1`
