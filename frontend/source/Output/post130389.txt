Invalid Argument using ditto <body> I'm using a backup script on my server that uses ditto and I keep getting the following error:  precodeditto: /Volumes/BKP/Daily_bkp.051114/VM Share/Machine/Backups/backup_copies.cmd: Invalid argument /code/pre  This is my code  precode/usr/bin/ditto -V --rsrc "$VMSHARE"  "$DLY_BKP/VM Share" &gt; $DLOG 2&gt; $TMPLOG err=$? /code/pre  I'm using double quotes to deal with the spaces in the directory name and this file is the only one ditto is having an issue with. I checked the backup and it actually backed up the file no problem, so I'm stumped as to why I keep getting this error. The file doesn't ever change and I've made sure nothing is using it at the time of the backup.  Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.  <answer131267> I solved it, the file in question had extended metadata on it and that is what caused the problem. I attempted using the --norsrc and --noextattr flags, but this didn't work. I removed the extended metadata and it is now working without any errors. I don't know if there is a better approach, but to get rid of the metadata I did  precodecat backup_copies.cmd &gt; tmp rm backup_copies.cmd mv tmp backup_copies.cmd /code/pre  <comment166717> Easier way to do it     xattr -c file
