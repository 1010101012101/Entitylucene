How do I generate a random even number with Applescript? <body> I'm trying to create an Applescript that will change the MAC address of my router automatically. Some fields need to be even numbers but I can't figure out how to generate even numbers only. Heres what I have so far ..  precodeset rand1 to (random number from 10 to 98) as string set rand2 to (random number from 10 to 98) as string set rand3 to (random number from 10 to 98) as string set rand4 to (random number from 10 to 98) as string  tell application "Safari"     activate     open location "router-address/WanMAC.asp"     tell application "System Events"         delay 1         keystroke "login"         keystroke tab         keystroke "password"         delay 1         keystroke return         delay 1         keystroke tab         keystroke rand1         keystroke tab         keystroke rand2         keystroke tab         keystroke rand3         keystroke tab         keystroke rand4         submit via javascript?     end tell end tell /code/pre  Pretty rudimentary I know. But the basic idea is to fill in my login credentials, tab to the form fields that need to be changed, inputs a valid MAC address and then submits the form. Can anyone help? Thank you.  <answer90838> You can just multiply by 2:  precode(random number from 5 to 49) * 2 /code/pre  <answer90855> precodeset rand to (random number from 0 to 99) if rand mod 2 is not equal to 0 then     set rand to rand - 1 end if /code/pre  <answer90857> Here is another option:  precodeset rand1 to randNum(10, 98)  on randNum(low, high)     (random number from low to high)     tell the result to if it mod 2 = 0 then return it     randNum(low, high) end randNum /code/pre  <answer91526> I thought this was a handy bit of code to tidy up and expand on a bit.  precodeon evenRandomNumber(low, high)     repeat         set randomNumber to (random number from low to high)         if randomNumber mod 2 = 0 then exit repeat     end repeat     return randomNumber end evenRandomNumber  on oddRandomNumber(low, high)     repeat         set randomNumber to (random number from low to high)         if randomNumber mod 2 â‰  0 then exit repeat     end repeat     return randomNumber end oddRandomNumber /code/pre  <comment106755> Ahh how simple. I feel like an idiot .. thanks :-)
