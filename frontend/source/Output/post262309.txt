When Using Apple News App Data Icon Spins Constantly <body> I love the updated Apple News App. But I find every time I use it, the spinning data icon next to the wifi signal spins constantly. It never stops! My iPad heats up and drains the battery fast. Why is this happening? Is the app poorly designed?   <comment328606> Because it's Constantly. Loading. News. Which it's supposed to be doing.
