New drive in the mail. I tried using a 4-5 yr old Lexar 8GB and got this vague error.  Since I just bought a new SanDisk 16GB I'm thinking maybe I needed a newer drive, but no go, same error. Have tried to erase, partition, repair, etc both USB drives in Disk Utility.  <answer140456> Mavericks needs 8 GB space.   Not sure your Lexar 8GB drive has that space free.   Check for it.  I use following process to make a bootable USB.  Format it, using Disk Utility, as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) drive, named Mavericks.  This can be done from the Erase tab within the app; make sure the USB drive strongdoes not/strong have multiple partitions (that can happen, so turn to the Partition tab to verify and correct this).  Open Terminal and Copy/Paste following.  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Mavericks --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app --no interaction. /code/pre  The process....

Done.  <answer140462> There is an automation tool called DiskMaker X. All you need for the program to work is the disk image that you are trying to make a usb of. It does all the work for you. Just make sure that you have a full image and not a partial one.
