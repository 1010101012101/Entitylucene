I have an Apple keyboard that isn't recognized by my Mac <body> I have the wired Apple keyboard that has the numeric keypad. When I try to use the command or control keys in Cs4....they don't work. When I checked the keyboard input area in my preferences..it shows a keyboard that looks nothing like the one I'm using. How can I get my Mac to recognize my keyboard. Thanks for your help.  <answer274388> Have you tried re-running the Keyboard Setup Assistant? First, get macOS to "forget" your keyboard:   codesudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist/code  and then reboot your Mac. If it still doesn't recognize the keyboard, you can try manually running the setup assistant  codesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/KeyboardSetupAssistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Keyboard SetupAssistant/code  to see if it detects any keyboards it's not sure about.   <comment344956> Have you tried a different USB port? Or trying the same keys in a different application?
