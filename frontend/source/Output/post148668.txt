How to open a file as plain text in TextEdit? <body> I have a *.rtf file which I want to open as plain text. How can I do this?  <answer148669> TextEdit  Preferences  Open and Save  Check "RTF-files as RTF-code instead of formated text" and reopen the file.  <answer148675> If you want a plain text version (without seeing all the RTF encoding) open the file, then Format  Make Plain Text (shift-command-T).  This is going to change the original in the file system, so if you do not want to lose the .rtf version, make a copy first.  <comment175087> Thanks for your answer. You can leave it for others. I wanted to see all the RTF encoding.
