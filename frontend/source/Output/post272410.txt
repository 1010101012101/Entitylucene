Inserting blank lines into RTF file with AppleScript <body> Can someone tell me what is the best way that I can automatically insert a blank line at the top and bottom of these newly-created .rtf files, for these two separate pieces of code?  First piece of code (for when the clipboard contains rich text):  precodetry     set richTextfromClipboard to get the clipboard as «class RTF » on error eStr number eNum     display dialog eStr &amp; " number " &amp; eNum buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with icon caution     return end try  try     set fileHandle to open for access theRichTextFilepath with write permission     write richTextfromClipboard to fileHandle     close access fileHandle on error eStr number eNum     display dialog eStr &amp; " number " &amp; eNum buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "File I/O Error..." with icon caution     try         close access fileHandle     end try end try /code/pre  Second piece of code (for when the clipboard contains HTML):  precodetry     do shell script "osascript -e 'try' -e 'get the clipboard as «class HTML»' -e 'end try' | awk '{sub(/«data HTML/, \"3C68746D6C3E\") sub(/»/, \"3C2F68746D6C3E\")} {print}' | xxd -r -p | textutil -convert rtf -stdin -stdout &gt; " &amp; quoted form of theRichTextFilepath on error eStr number eNum     display dialog eStr &amp; " number " &amp; eNum buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with icon caution end try /code/pre  The blank lines do not have to be of a predetermined font type or font size; the blank lines should simply match the style of the surrounding .rtf file (that is, the style of the rich text on the clipboard).  <answer272697> You can use this Cocoa-AppleScript:  precode-- Cocoa-AppleScript-- you need these lines in your script use framework "Foundation" use scripting additions  on insertTextInRTFFile(f) -- the parameter must be the posix path of an existing file, example  --&gt; "/Users/someName/Desktop/xyz.rtf"     set myText to linefeed -- the text to insert in the rtf (a blank line as example)     tell current application         set fileURL to its (NSURL's fileURLWithPath:f)         set myOption to its (NSDictionary's alloc()'s initWithObjectsAndKeys_(its NSRTFTextDocumentType, its NSDocumentTypeDocumentOption, missing value))         set {attrString, docAttrib, err} to its ((NSMutableAttributedString's alloc())'s initWithURL:fileURL options:myOption documentAttributes:(reference) |error|:(reference)) -- get the attributed string from the RTF file         if attrString is missing value then error err's localizedDescription() as text -- not a RTF file or not a valid path          -- it use the string in the 'myText' variable to create an attributed string          set firstline to its ((NSAttributedString's alloc())'s initWithString:myText attributes:(attrString's attributesAtIndex:0 effectiveRange:(missing value))) --  create an attributed string with the style of the first character         set lastline to its ((NSAttributedString's alloc())'s initWithString:myText attributes:(attrString's attributesAtIndex:((attrString's |length|()) - 1) effectiveRange:(missing value))) --  create an attributed string with the style of the last character     end tell     attrString's insertAttributedString:firstline atIndex:0 -- insert an attributed string (blank line) at the top     attrString's appendAttributedString:lastline -- insert an attributed string (blank line) at bottom     set rtfData to attrString's RTFFromRange:{0, attrString's |length|()} documentAttributes:docAttrib -- create the data from an attributed string     rtfData's writeToFile:f atomically:true -- write the data to the RTF file end insertTextInRTFFile /code/pre  After your script will have written to the RTF file:  just call the codeinsertTextInRTFFile()/code handler with the strongposix path/strong of the RTF file as parameter.  <comment342740> I'm going to have to start learning this Cocoa-AppleScript, as the last two answers you posted to rubik's sphere's questions are very interesting! +1
