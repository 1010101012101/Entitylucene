Postfix Not Accepting Commands on OSX Lion - Timeout Occurs <body> I am building a web application on my MacBook Pro which needs to send email. When the application attempts to send, the connection times out. I am running postfix and I I followed the directions found here.  To troubleshoot the server, I used telnet to manually connect to localhost on port 25. I was able to connect to it successfully, but I received no response as I typed commands. Here is a transcript.  precodeBenjamin-Brames-MacBook-Pro:LaunchDaemons bbrame$ telnet localhost 25 Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. helo bbrame mail from: ben@benbrame.com rcpt to: ben@benbrame.com /code/pre  I connected to working mail server and typed the same commands. The mail server gave a response to each command I typed as expected.   precodeBenjamin-Brames-MacBook-Pro:~ bbrame$ telnet smtp.newnorth.net 25 Trying 66.133.129.10... Connected to relay.glb.frontiernet.net. Escape character is '^]'. 220 relay03.roch.ny.frontiernet.net ESMTP Postfix helo bbrame 250 relay03.roch.ny.frontiernet.net mail from: made_up_email@frontiernet.net 501 5.1.7 Bad sender address syntax. See http://postmaster.frontiernet.net /code/pre  The mail log on my MacBook shows that it recognizes when I connect, but doesn't register any subsequent commands.   precodeDec  1 18:53:50 Benjamin-Brames-MacBook-Pro postfix/postscreen[21354]: CONNECT from [127.0.0.1]:56145 Dec  1 18:53:50 Benjamin-Brames-MacBook-Pro postfix/postscreen[21354]: WHITELISTED [127.0.0.1]:56145 Dec  1 18:54:08 Benjamin-Brames-MacBook-Pro postfix/smtpd[21359]: fatal: open /etc/postfix/submit.cred: No such file or directory Dec  1 18:54:09 Benjamin-Brames-MacBook-Pro postfix/master[21176]: warning: process /usr/libexec/postfix/smtpd pid 21359 exit status 1 Dec  1 18:54:09 Benjamin-Brames-MacBook-Pro postfix/master[21176]: warning: /usr/libexec/postfix/smtpd: bad command startup -- throttling /code/pre  Any guesses why the connection is timing out?   Thanks!  <answer32833> The last three log messages turned out to be the culprit. Googling for them turned up this page;  In order to fix the problem your console is displaying, you should:  ul liCreate a codesubmit.cred/code file in code/etc/postfix/code directory (codesudo touch /etc/postfix/submit.cred/code will do)./li liCreate a header for that file: codesudo echo "submitcred version 1" &gt;&gt; /etc/postfix/submit.cred/code/li liAdd as many lines as the number of users you want to enable to submit mail, in the form codehostname|user|passwd/code: codesudo echo''hostname|username|password" &gt;&gt; /etc/postfix/submit.cred/code/li liGive the file the appropriate permissions: codesudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/submit.cred/code/li /ul  Once you've done this you could restart postfix and everything sould run smoothly.  I created the file /etc/postfix/submit.cred and set the permissions to 0600. Everything started working after that.   <answer99510> Just comment out the codeimap_submit_cred_file = /etc/postfix/submit.cred/code in the code/etc/postfix/main.cf/code file. Then you don't have to configure any usernames and passwords. And Postfix listens to localhost only by default.
