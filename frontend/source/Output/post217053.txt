Keyboard shortcuts for Terminal <body> I am trying to add a shortcut to the menu bar actions in the Terminal app, (specifically to create a new window with my own theme.) Here is a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IxaiV.jpg" alt="Here is a screenshot"  However when I try to add the shortcut via the System Preferences Keyboard Shortcuts page,   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VqjrF.png" alt="enter image description here"  the Terminal app does not show up as one of the options for apps that could have more shortcuts. I looked in the "Other..." section of apps for Terminal, but Terminal was grayed out and unelectable:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOpSy.png" alt="enter image description here" Is this even possible, to add a shortcut to the menu bar in the Terminal app, and if so, how would it be done?  <answer217055> You can simply add codePresentation/code to you keyboard shortcuts list in codeSystem Preferences/code and that should work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDZTn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer217056> At the bottom of the dropdown to choose an app, there should be an Other... option (this is for apps that are not listed).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9uEw2.png" alt="The Other option"  From there you should be able to just type "Presentation" into the dialog, because that is the first occurrence in the Terminal menu.  <comment262377> I tried this, and searched for Terminal, but it was grayed out and unselectable. <comment262378> In `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`? That's really odd... <comment262379> Yes. I added another screenshot to the question.
