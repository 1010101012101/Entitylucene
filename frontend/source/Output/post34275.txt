How can I fix Firefox's jagged scrolling on Lion? <body> I noticed that scrolling in Firefox on Lion is not very pleasant experience.  Is there a way to optimize it for better performance?  I tried smooth scrolling setting - but it didn't do anything.  <answer34288> Go to configuration by type codeabout:config/code in address bar and press enter key then enter scroll in filter box, now you can change all scroll options.  <comment39127> How are you scrolling? I use FireFox, on 4GB iMac with Magic mouse, no problems. <comment39162> I use built in track-pad <comment78045> Works fine for me: Mac Air trackpad, 10.7.4, FF 15.0.1.
