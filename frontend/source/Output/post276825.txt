Python path added to $PATH -- cannot find origin <body> I just installed Python 3.6 from python.org on macOS Sierra.  Somehow, the path to python's codebin/code is added to my every code$PATH/code but I can't figure out how:  precode22:15 : echo $PATH                                                                           /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin /code/pre  Now, code/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code is the default value in my code/etc/paths/code and the codeX11/code, codegit/code and codeTeX/code parts come from the 3 files in code/etc/paths.d//code. But I have no Python-related file in code/etc/paths.d//code.  And there is nothing related to Python in my code~/.zshrc/code.  Does anyone know where the Python bit of code$PATH/code is coming from?  <answer276829> Check ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile  <answer276891> zsh reads from up to 4files on start up      If ZDOTDIR is not set, then the value of HOME is used; this is the usual case.   precode$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin /code/pre  You need to look in all of them.   .zshrc is read every time a shell or sub shell is started. .zprofile is read when you start a login shell - ie the first shell you start through terminal, and this is where I would put the PATH changes   <comment348472> hat is in  ~/.zprofile and  ~/.zlogin and does this PATH show in a new shell? and what is in ~/.bashrc <comment348477> What are the results of `cd; grep 'PATH' .z*`? <comment348478> `.bash_profile` (`.bashrc` isn't common on macOS) is specific to Bash; the OP appears to be using Zsh. <comment348479> Last time I had the same issue, I found I sourced bashrc in zshrc <comment348482> @aahung zsh and bash languages differ .bashrc might cause syntax erros - much better to keep them separate <comment348484> You made a point. It was long time ago I did this when I was not familiar and chased convenience. And recently I notice when I installed a new version of Python, the installer append to bash-files instead of zsh-files. Maybe he/she has the similar situation <comment348516> @Mark: bingo, Python modified (actually created) ~/.zprofile!! If you make it an answer I'll accept it.
