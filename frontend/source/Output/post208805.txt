A simple script to automate functions in Safari <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JJVZB.png" alt="clear history"  I can navigate a script to control specific "Menu" items... but I can not find information on directing a script to find and click a specific button on a drop down sheet such as the one shown  h1Im just too inexperienced to know the proper naming and path commands .. any pointers to relevant information is appreciated./h1  Here is some more information.  Using Automator and Script Editor I made two scripts, saved them as Applications and set them each with a command key.  The result was that I could quickly open and close Safari and have the browser reset each time... works like a charm until Apple modifies Safari enough where the scripts need to be adjusted for the new path to the same function.  This time the control to reset is the "Clear History" function with I believe also clears the website data as well. Safari can be set to open in Private mode by default now so that helps a lot for keeping the cache clean  So once the user hits the menu item "Clear History"... instead of a pop up anything... there is a drop down.??..sheet?  h1I have gotten the script to get as far as that... the script seems to have located the "sheet"... but can not locate the button I want it to click./h1  What I have so far that gets .. to.. the button that I want clicked:  precodetell application "System Events" tell application process "Safari"     tell menu bar 1 to tell menu bar item "Safari" to tell menu 1 to tell menu item "Clear History…" to click end tell /code/pre  end tell  I tried to insert something like:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Safari" to tell sheet 1 to click (button whose description is "Clear History") /code/pre  end tell  the error result looks like:  error "Can’t get button whose description = \"Clear History\"." number -1728  Now I’m actually surprise the script got this far as I’m just hacking lines I saw in other scripts that I thought might work.  So basically I just can’t make my little script take the jump from controlling a few menu items to getting pointed to some type of drop down and making a button click for me.  Thanks in advance for your time and efforts.  <answer212686> The following script works for me:  precodetell application "Safari"     activate     close every window end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "Safari"         click menu item 6 of menu "safari" of menu bar item "Safari" of menu bar 1         delay 0.5         click button 2 of window 1     end tell end tell  tell application "Safari"     make new document     set the window_width to 1680     set the window_height to 1575     set the bounds of window 1 to {0, 22, window_width, 22 + window_height} end tell /code/pre  <answer212742> Thank you very much....  asa...  your answers very helpful.  The current result does work as needed(great and thank you)... but I am confused at the beginning where Safari is told to "close every window".. it seemed to be an unnecessary step but I was unable to make the script function without it.  I made two scripts.. one to open Safari, but this one isn't really necessary but it can be used to quickly close a standard window and replace it with an open "Private" window.  The second script resets Safari to clear out the History and website data then quits Safari to give you a fresh clean browser when next opened.  hr  Here is the "Open" version:  precodetell application "System Events" tell application "Safari"     activate     close every window end tell tell process "Safari"     click menu item 6 of menu "safari" of menu bar item "Safari" of menu bar 1     delay 0.5     click button 2 of window 1 end tell tell application process "Safari"     tell menu bar 1 to tell menu bar item "File" to tell menu 1 to tell menu item "New Private Window" to click end tell /code/pre  end tell      hr  and to reset AND quit Safari:  precodetell application "System Events" tell application "Safari"     activate     close every window end tell tell process "Safari"     click menu item 6 of menu "safari" of menu bar item "Safari" of menu bar 1     delay 0.5     click button 2 of window 1 end tell tell application "Safari"     quit end tell /code/pre  end tell  hr  In Script Editor I saved each script as an Application and placed then into the users "Application" folder. Next I opened system preferences/Security &amp; Privacy and selected "Accessibility"  Once unlocked I selected the "+" and added only one of the Applications(scripts),then closed the preference window to save it.  Then I repeated with the second application?script. Now they are both in the Application folder and have been given Accessibility.  hr  Next I opened Automator and created a new "Service" for each App.. again.. one at a time  Lastly I assigned both new services a separate keyboard shortcut. To do this open system preferances/Keyboard...  I choose to use the F1 &amp; F2 keys so I needed to check that selection in the keyboard panel. Next I went to the "Shortcuts" panel, selected the "Services" tab on the left side...found the two newly created services and assigned them each a shortcut.  hr  from this point it's a simple (command F1) to open.. and (command F2) to close...   <comment251792> With script you mean AppleScript? Can you please add a short version of what you have already tried and where it fails?
