Is it possible to invoke play button using terminal? <body> I want to control my media player (iTunes, Spotify, etc) using terminal. My goal was simply to trigger press on play/pause button using script. Is that possible?  <answer229545> I'm not certain about Spotify etc, but for iTunes if Doug's Applescripts for iTunes can't do it, it probably can't be done. It's got to be the longest running &amp; most comprehensive site for all things iTunes.br If that's not enough, there are half a dozen apps too.  <answer229550> You can control iTunes using AppleScript:  precodetell application "iTunes" to play /code/pre  To run it directly from Terminal command line, you can use codeosascript/code:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "iTunes" to play' /code/pre  To figure out what commands are available in iTunes, use the ScriptEditor app and open the dictionary of iTunes, see How do I find out the applescript commands available for a particular app?  <comment280041> Yup, that one using apple script. Thats why I want to trigger the play/pause button. My idea, maybe, just maybe, we could trigger the hex code of the button. http://www.kbdedit.com/manual/low_level_vk_list.html <comment280043> Why do you need to do it from Terminal? Would it not be easier to set up the script as a Service & hot-key it?
