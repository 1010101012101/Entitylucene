iPhoto 9.5.1 update <body> I have been trying to update iPhoto through App Store on my iMac, but I constantly fail. It always downloads the whole package - 1.15GB, then it does its mumbo jumbo, but everytime it looks promising, it shows a red sign - emAn error has occurred/em.  strongOf course I have tried rebooting the computer! :-)/strong  I have a 2010 iMac with Mavericks installed...anybody encountered the same problem?  <answer117699> Try deleting code~/Library/Caches/com.apple.storehelper/*/code and code~/Library/Caches/com.apple.installer/*/code  You might have some sort of permissions problem on the existing copy of iPhoto so you might also try deleting it manually before you download the new one.
