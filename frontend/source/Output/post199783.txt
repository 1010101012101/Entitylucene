strange entry in my Finder "Shared" list <body> I have several Macs on my home network, running different OS's. Let's call them "computer1", "computer2", computer3", etc. All of them show up in the Finder lists as "Shared", as they should. But all the machines (even "computer2") show another item in the Finder list called "doug_(computer2.local)". (I'm "doug".) Whazzat?  When I click on "computer1", "computer2" and "computer3", I'm automatically connected to those computers with my account, as I want to be. When I click on "doug_(computer2.local)" I get a "Not Connected" message, though am offered the opportunity to share the computer2 screen, using my computer2 password.  So where does this "doug_(computer2.local)" item come from? It just looks out of place in the Shared list. How do I get rid of it?  I have, BTW, rebooted my router and cleared the device list, but that doesn't make that Finder "Shared" list entry go away. Also, BTW, "doug_(computer2.local)" doesn't have it's own entry in that device list. So it isn't a "device".   When I reboot "computer2", both "computer2" and "doug_(computer2.local)" reappear in everyones Finder "Shared" list. So something in computer2 is set up to offer two separate shares.   This is obviously not a big problem, but it is somewhat annoying as I don't know why it's happening.   <comment240574> One share on afp the other on smb perhaps? Check system prefs  Sharing  File Sharing - then under the "File Sharing: On" see if afp *and* smb addresses are shown. If you have no Windows users, you can disable smb in Options... <comment240581> I unchecked smb and ftp sharing on "computer2", and that odd share is still there. Do I have to reboot? <comment240582> possibly. I work on a dual-platform network & the number of times I see old or temporary machines listed is so common I tend to just ignore them, they go away eventually
