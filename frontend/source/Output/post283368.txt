Wifi network option is not showing up <body> I have a problem with my Wifi driver. I get the message  codeWi-Fi: No Hardware Installed/code, which is like the one described here: Wi-Fi: No Hardware Installed  I followed all the instructions given on that page, and from other sites including Apple support. Finally, I tried to remove Wifi from the system preferences and add it back. Unfortunately, adding back a network has no option for Wifi.  I tried codenetworksetup -setairportpower airport on/code as well. This gives me an error of: codeYou cannot set Wi-Fi power because all AirPort network services are disabled./code Any help will be deeply appreciated.  strongEDIT:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VwBum.png" alt="Wifi option not displaying in the Network options."  I updated an screenshot with Wifi not displayed in the wifi setup in system utility.  I tried these approaches:  ul liApple hardware test (Short term): No issues found./li liLogin in safe mode and then reboot, check system preferences same issue./li liDowngraded to OSX El Capitan (I thought there might be some issue with the upgrade), but the same issue still existed./li liAgain upgraded to OSX Sierra but the issue persisted./li /ul  One thing I noticed, when booting from USB, There were no errors like codeWi-Fi: No Hardware Installed/code but the spinner was continuously moving and searching for the networks and it had blank dropdown (without any results). My router was on and WiFi for other devices on the network.  Thanks in advance!  <answer284978> strong[This answer not final until this sentence removed]/strong  Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires quite a bit of patience. Let's proceed as follows.  strongHave you followed Allan's advice?/strong  I'm assuming you've already booted into Safe Mode and used Apple Hardware Test (as suggested by Allan in his comment on May 11)?   ul listrongIf you haven't,/strong then please follow the steps below for booting into Safe Mode and Running Apple Hardware Test./li listrongIf you have,/strong can you please edit your question to provide the results of performing both actions. Then skip the steps below for performing these actions and try the Terminal commands I suggest./li /ul  strongRun Apple Hardware Test/strong  ol liShut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liPress and hold the kbdD/kbd key before the gray startup screen appears./li liAfter a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start./li liWhen prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. /li liWhen the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the "Perform extended testing" checkbox before you click the Test button./li liYour test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console./li /ol  Take a note of the result and report back.  strongNote 1:/strong The extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back.   strongNote 2:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. do you see the Wi-Fi option in System Preferences  Network?)/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li liCheck System Preferences  Network again/li /ol  Once you've booted into Safe Mode, let us know how you went.  Now, assuming you still have the problem after already booting into Safe Mode and running Apple Hardware Test, let's proceed with the following course of action.  strongRun these Terminal commands/strong  Let's confirm what macOS believes the status of your Wi-Fi service is. To do this:  ol liLaunch Terminal/li liEnter the following command:  codesudo networksetup -listallnetworkservices/code/li liPress kbdEnter/kbd/li liEnter your password (note you will not see the cursor move, nor the characters appear on the screen)/li /ol  Now, in the list that appears I assume you will see an asterisk (*) next to the Wi-Fi service. This denotes that it is currently disabled. Assuming this is what happens, let's try enabling it as follows:  ol liMake sure you're still in Terminal/li liEnter the following command:  codenetworksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi on/code/li liA popup will prompt you for your password - enter it and click on the kbdModify Configuration/kbd button /li liNow enter this command:  codenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on/code/li liRestart your Mac/li liNow check System Preferences  Network again/li /ol  Let me know how you go.  <answer285211> Can you specify which Mac model &amp; year you're using?   I suspect that this is a hardware issue that needs repaired. These steps will tell if you that's the case.  First try an SMC Reset. You'll find the instructions for this here and an NVRAM reset, instructions here.  Then boot into Recovery Mode by holding CMD + R during startup. This is going to take a bit longer than it normally would to boot - let it run it's course even if takes around 15 minutes.  If the wifi doesn't work there either even after an NVRAM/SMC reset you can be confident that it's a hardware issue. Recovery Mode is overlooked a lot of times as a test bed but it's essentially another installation of OS X that's never been touched or modified, so if it persists you can be sure it's not caused by a faulty kext/program you might've installed.  If the issue is resolved in Recovery it was either by the SMC/NVRAM reset (in which case it will be resolved altogether) or there's an application in your user account causing it, where Safe Mode or creating a new test account in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups are good next troubleshooting steps.  <comment357243> Go to System Preferences  Network, select the Wi-Fi network in the left pane, and click the negative sign ( â€“ ) at the bottom (to the left of the gear icon) and delete the network. Click the Apply button. Next, Click the plus sign ( + ) and create a new Wi-Fi network. Click the Apply button. **Restart!**  Does it work? <comment357245> I can't access That wifi option. I am updating the post with attached Image of it. <comment357255> Did you try booting in Safe Mode?  Also try running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected. <comment359279> It doesn't seem like your Mac is recognizing any Wifi hardware. What does the System report show? Go under the Apple Menu to "About this Mac" Click on "System Report" and then "Network-Wifi"  Is there anything there? <comment359638> I would like to point out that Apple Hardware Test is not actually very helpful for hardware troubleshooting. It takes a long time & doesn't provide much info. <comment359639> This is true, it does take a minimalist approach in terms of what's reported back to users. However, it's the one tool available to all Mac users (at least in theory). And, when it does detect an error it's extremely accurate and provides enough info to isolate potential problems. That said, it's certainly not my tool of choice for specific hardware tests (e.g. for memory). It's a good place to start for a quick test, but you do often have to use other tools to run much more thorough tests. <comment359728> That all doesn't solves the issue. Hardware test doesn't seems to display any issue with the computer. And I tried all the steps mentioned but it doesn't seems to work. <comment359741> Do you have the ability to boot up from another system (including Recovery HD) to see if WiFi is working there? It's entirely possible that your WiFi radio is not functioning, and that further troubleshooting of software on that system may be futile. I'd recommend booting up from something else, and determining if WiFi is working so that you aren't spinning your wheels with software fixes (when the issues may be hardware-related). <comment359762> When you say _it doesn't seem to work_ can you clarify that? For example, when you go through the process of entering the `sudo networksetup -listallnetworkservices` terminal command (followed by entering your password), what happens? Do you see a list of network services? If so, is Wi-Fi listed? If so, does it have an asterisk (*) next to it? <comment359768> Wi-Fi is not listed there. <comment359773> Ok, can you advise whether you've tried the steps suggested in the answer by @fuccboi ? These are all things I'd have suggested as we continued to work through this, so you should try them (although forget the last paragraph re: creating a test account for now). If you already have, what did you find? If you haven't, please do this now and let me know how you go. By that stage we will have eliminated a lot of possibilities. <comment360089> Agree with @MERM and Eddie Kelley. You need to check to make sure you have a physical device for the software to talk to, and if you don't try to determine why the hardware isn't working (could be it's not connected fully, or is just not working). If you follow MERMs advice you should see something like: https://www.dropbox.com/s/87wps97tkzkwa8r/Wifi.png?dl=0 <comment360130> Any update? How'd you go with fuccboi's steps?
