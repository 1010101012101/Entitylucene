Lock screen timed lockout <body> Is it possible to configure the Mac lock screen to refuse to accept login attempts for a certain amount of time after the lock screen is activated?  <comment312511> Eh, I think not. Why would you want that? <comment312526> As an extra security precaution for corporate machines (I'm in infosec). <comment312553> Ok, it's a great thought but I have no idea how that would be possible. Maybe just set a stronger password?
