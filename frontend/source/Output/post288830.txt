Can't run Jupyter Notebook after updating python on MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 <body> So I had codepython 3.5/code installed on my MacOS Sierra and got jupyter notebook installed via codepip3/code and run properly. Recently, I updated to codepython 3.6/code and whenever I tried to run jupyter notebook and start a new notebook, the Kernel Error was happened with the following message:  precodeTraceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/notebook/base/handlers.py", line 516, in wrapper     result = yield gen.maybe_future(method(self, *args, **kwargs))   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1055, in run     value = future.result()   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/concurrent.py", line 238, in result     raise_exc_info(self._exc_info)   File "&lt;string&gt;", line 4, in raise_exc_info   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1063, in run     yielded = self.gen.throw(*exc_info)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/notebook/services/sessions/handlers.py", line 75, in post     type=mtype))   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1055, in run     value = future.result()   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/concurrent.py", line 238, in result     raise_exc_info(self._exc_info)   File "&lt;string&gt;", line 4, in raise_exc_info   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1063, in run     yielded = self.gen.throw(*exc_info)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/notebook/services/sessions/sessionmanager.py", line 79, in create_session     kernel_id = yield self.start_kernel_for_session(session_id, path, name, type, kernel_name)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1055, in run     value = future.result()   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/concurrent.py", line 238, in result     raise_exc_info(self._exc_info)   File "&lt;string&gt;", line 4, in raise_exc_info   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1063, in run     yielded = self.gen.throw(*exc_info)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/notebook/services/sessions/sessionmanager.py", line 92, in start_kernel_for_session     self.kernel_manager.start_kernel(path=kernel_path, kernel_name=kernel_name)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 1055, in run     value = future.result()   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/concurrent.py", line 238, in result     raise_exc_info(self._exc_info)   File "&lt;string&gt;", line 4, in raise_exc_info   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 307, in wrapper     yielded = next(result)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/notebook/services/kernels/kernelmanager.py", line 94, in start_kernel     super(MappingKernelManager, self).start_kernel(**kwargs)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jupyter_client/multikernelmanager.py", line 110, in start_kernel     km.start_kernel(**kwargs)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jupyter_client/manager.py", line 257, in start_kernel     **kw)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jupyter_client/manager.py", line 203, in _launch_kernel     return launch_kernel(kernel_cmd, **kw)   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jupyter_client/launcher.py", line 128, in launch_kernel     proc = Popen(cmd, **kwargs)   File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py", line 707, in __init__     restore_signals, start_new_session)   File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py", line 1326, in _execute_child     raise child_exception_type(errno_num, err_msg) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.5' /code/pre  I've tried to uninstall codepython 3.6/code and install codepython 3.5/code via codeHomebrew/code.

In particular, Pythons installed to /Library can interfere with other software installs. /code/pre  However, only python 2.7 is installed in that directory on my system. And I'm not sure if it's conflicted with python 3.6  <comment364807> First step if your Homebrew setup gets confused: `brew doctor` <comment364811> @patrix I updated the question to show the brew doctor message
