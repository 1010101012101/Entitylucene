Pages Exports oversized PDF documents <body> I produce a quarterly newsletter for an organisation I belong to. I have been using Pages '09 until recently, but now use Pages version 6.2. Once completed I Export as PDF for distribution.  I noticed the PDF for the latest issue was larger than usual, and in fact is stronglarger/strong than the pages file! The Pages document is principally text, with a couple of small images (logos) exported with image quality "Good".  The pages file is 359,571; the exported PDF 658,283. I then used the Print option, which produced a file 257,543.  Examined in Finder, the Resolution of both files is identical.  Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any setting to restore normal performance?
