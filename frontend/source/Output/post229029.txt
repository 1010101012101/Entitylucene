security command gives out passwords without prompting for the keychain password <body> When I try to access a keychain password using the keychain access GUI, I always get a dialog box for inputting the current keychain (login) password.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tvm9O.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, when I try the same thing from the command line using commands like the following  precodesecurity find-generic-password -gs site_name  /code/pre  there is no such dialog for password input and the password is just given without any form of validation.  Is there any way to change this?  <answer271229> First try to unlock the keychain with codesecurity unlock-keychain -p :the_keychain_password: :path_to_keychain:/code
