How to create ~/.bash_profile and ~/.profile <body> So, I don't have code.bash_profile/code neither code.profile/code in my home folder. How do I create them? After that, what should I do so every time I open the terminal these files get read?  <answer99836> You can use the codetouch/code command.  For instance,  precodecd ~ /code/pre  to go to the home directory.  Now we will create a file called code.bash_profile/code (the dot means that it will be hidden).  Then use codenano/code or codevi/code in the Terminal. Unless you know what codevi/code is, just use codenano/code. To open up these files, you would use:  precodesudo nano .bash_profile /code/pre  codesudo/code makes sure that you will be able to save these files. Here, you can add codealiases/code. codenano/code or codevi/code will automatically create a new file if it does not exist in your current directory in Terminal.  After you are finished, press kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdO/kbd, kbdEnter/kbd, and kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdX/kbd to save and quit. Finally, use  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  to reload the Terminal and it will read what you put in those files.  Of course, you can alias that too if you want. :)  To answer your final question, these files will automatically be read every time you open the Terminal. However, if there is an error (For instance, don't put spaces between aliases), it will tell you.  h2More Information/h2  As George pointed out, code.bash_profile/code will run only on login shells. For non-login shells, you would need to create a code.bashrc/code file with:  precode    sudo nano .bashrc /code/pre  h2Links/h2  .bash_profile vs .bashrc  Importance of .bashrc  <answer99900> I prefer to use GUI text editors such as BBEdit or TextWrangler.  These text editors can handle invisible files such as .profile and .bash_profile and they have the advantage of having a GUI interface, unlike nano which is a console interface.  TextWrangler  BBEdit  <answer99915> You can also use a GUI text editor like TextEdit:  precodetouch ~/.bash_profile open -e ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  codeopen -e/code is a shortcut for codeopen -a TextEdit/code.  You don't necessarily have to create .profile or .bashrc. Terminal and iTerm 2 open new shells as login shells, so bash doesn't read .bashrc. If both .bash_profile and .profile exist, bash reads only .bash_profile when it is invoked as an interactive login shell. .profile is read by ksh when it is invoked as an interactive login shell and by bash when it is invoked as sh as an interactive login shell.  I have actually told iTerm 2 to open new shells as non-login shells, and my .bash_profile just contains a line like code. ~/.bashrc/code. tmux and the shell mode in emacs open new shells as non-login shells by default. .bash_profile is still read when I ssh to my computer.  <comment117558> Why are you using `touch` to create empty files first? `nano` does this automatically anyway. <comment117564> Also, you probably don't want both ~/.profile and ~/.bash_profile -- if bash sees .bash_profile, it doesn't bother with .profile. Finally, it'll only get run for "login" shells; nonlogin shells run ~/.bashrc instead.

And if you have both, what do you have inside `~/.profile` that can't be done in `~/.bash_profile`? <comment117651> Let me see if I got that... You have both `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile`? And you also have `~/.bashrc`? <comment117660> @ThiG: I wouldn't have one be a copy of the other; you're likely to add something to one, forget to add it to the other, and get confused. See my recommendations on [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4493063/best-practice-for-bash-start-up-files-on-a-mac) for what I'd consider best practice. <comment117705> I don't have a .profile, and my .bash_profile just contains `. ~/.bashrc`.
