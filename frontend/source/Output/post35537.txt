Can I type in inverse case, lIKE tHIS, with caps lock on? <body> Every so often, I have to type some text consisting mostly of uppercase letters, but with an occasional lowercase letterâ€”essentially, sentence case, but inverted. On Windows, I would simply have caps lock on the entire time, and pressing Shift would give me a lowercase letter. On OS X, however, if caps lock is on, I only get uppercase letters, whether Shift is pressed or not.  So, I can either hold down Shift the entire time I'm typing, letting go of it briefly to type a lowercase letter, or press Caps Lock twice for each lowercase letter I type. Neither works as well as what Windows does.  Is there a way to get Caps Lock to behave as it does on Windows, where pressing Shift while caps lock is on produces lowercase letters?  I am running 10.6.  <answer36400> From what I have experienced, it cannot be done in OS X. None of the keyboard reconfiguration utilities I have tried seem to be able to do it either. Sorry. :(  <answer37012> h2See Update below.../h2  It seems (only) the input source "French - Numerical" will behave like Window Caps Lock (with iNVERSE sHIFT):    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OtJbc.png" alt="keyboard layout French - Numerical"  Found that info here.  But note that this will come with a rather unusual keyboard layout (at least for me).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZcj5.png" alt="keyboard layout French - Numerical1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AkLMn.png" alt="keyboard layout French - Numerical2"  h2Update: Using Ukelele this can be applied to all keyboard layouts:/h2  Thanks Daniel for pointing the right direction.  Open Ukelele and save your (current) layout to a file (e.g. by "New from current input source" and "Save"):    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eXwy7.png" alt="New from current input source"  Open the code.xml/code file in a text editor and find the codemapIndex/code that you want to use for the combination kbd&#x21E7;/kbd + kbd&#x21EA;/kbd (shift + caps-lock). For German I used codemapIndex="0"/code. Insert this line:    precode&lt;modifier keys="shift caps"/&gt; /code/pre  Find all other occurrences of this combination and comment them out (or delete the lines). Again for German it's:    precode&lt;keyMapSelect mapIndex="1"&gt; &lt;modifier keys="anyShift"/&gt; &lt;modifier keys="shift rightShift? caps? rightOption? rightControl"/&gt; &lt;modifier keys="shift rightShift? caps? rightOption rightControl?"/&gt; &lt;!--&lt;modifier keys="shift rightShift? caps rightOption? rightControl?"/&gt; --&gt;     &lt;/keyMapSelect&gt; /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wwOEk.png" alt="shift caps"  Re-open the modified file with Ukelele.    Here is a comparison of the "German" layout before and after the modification:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xTADp.png" alt="layout 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b1uT5.png" alt="layout 2"  Follow the instructions in Ukelele to create a new input source (Name, ID, installation).    I didn't test the modified file, should work though.  <comment42171> Which suggests that it's a feature that could be added to other layouts as well. I'm sure it can be done in Ukelele, but I haven't learned how yet. <comment42191> Thanks @Daniel for that comment - I figured it out. I'll add the procedure to my answer. <comment61758> This, however, will prevent you from using the !@#$%^&*() keys (Shifted top row number keys). To use those, I created [a custom layout which replicates exactly the "PC" behaviour on OS X](https://gist.github.com/2946420). Do note that this is for the US layout only, if you use another you'll have to do it yourself :)
