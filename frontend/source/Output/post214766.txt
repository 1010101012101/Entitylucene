Downloading additional voices from command-line <body> I am using a MacOS X server (to which I only have command-line access) to convert text to speech which is saved to sound files (using PyObjC). I would like to install some of the optional OS X voices (for example codecom.apple.speech.synthesis.voice.tom.premium/code) but I need to be able to do this through the command-line rather than via the System Preferences. Does anyone know a way to do this?  <answer214799> You can predownload the voice files to your App/Python package (or however you are distributing your app), and then write a script to move or copy the voice files to this folder:  precode/System/Library/Speech/Voices/ /code/pre  So:     ol   liDownload the voice files on your development machine/li   liWrap them inside an codeassets/code folder or something like this/li   liPart of your Travis script can be to move the files first in the Voices folder on the mac/li   liAnd after that, you run your tests/other scripts/li   /ol   <comment259379> Why can't you use Sys Prefs? <comment259384> I need to do this as part of a Travis (http://travis-ci.org) job, and therefore this ideally all has to be done via the command-line.
