Control-key behaves like F10 <body> The control-key on my MacBook Pro (OS X 10.8.4) has started behaving strangely. When I press it it acts in the same way as F10, bringing up Application Windows. This is a nuisance, as it affects key combinations that include the control-key.  I have no idea how this started, but I'd like to be able to stop it!  --Malcolm  <answer100884> Open strongMission Control/strong in System Preferences. You should check if strongLeft Control Key/strong is being used to call Mission Control. Try to remove it from selections.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HE1oL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
