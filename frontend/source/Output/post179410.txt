To install Gnufind in OSX? <body> I run  precodebrew search gnufind /code/pre  and I get  precodeNo formula found for "gnufind". Searching pull requests.. /code/pre  so no gnufind with the request.   I think it must have a different name. I run  precodebrew search find /code/pre  and I get  precodeffind        findutils    frag_find    pathfinder findbugs     flawfinder   fuzzy-find   rdfind homebrew/games/robotfindskitten Caskroom/cask/a-better-finder-attributes Caskroom/cask/a-better-finder-rename Caskroom/cask/easyfind Caskroom/cask/find-any-file Caskroom/cask/findings Caskroom/cask/keyfinder Caskroom/cask/neofinder Caskroom/cask/path-finder Caskroom/cask/qfinder Caskroom/cask/refresh-finder Caskroom/cask/totalfinder Caskroom/cask/xtrafinder /code/pre  I browse the commands by codebrew info [package]/code and find that the package emfindutils/em is maintained by GNU.  I run codebrew install findutils/code.  The package provides commands such as emfind/em and emlocate/em, docs here.  I do codehash -r/code but no commands updated in my system like emg'find/em or emfind'g/em.   strongHow can you install gnufind to your system?/strong  <answer179427> Follow instructions on this page to get the full suite of GNUTools on macs: http://goo.gl/IFE83i  I did this myself a while back.  It's essential you add the following line to your code.bashrc/code / code.bash_profile/code file:  codeexport PATH="$(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"/code  <answer179428> The commands are provided with a g prefix:  precodeMithos:~ verence$ ls -l /usr/local/Cellar/findutils/4.4.2/bin total 1328 -r-xr-xr-x  1 verence  admin  233400 Nov 13 05:03 gfind -r-xr-xr-x  1 verence  admin  143620 Nov 13 05:03 glocate -r-xr-xr-x  1 verence  admin  229704 Nov 13 05:03 goldfind -r-xr-xr-x  1 verence  admin    9837 Apr  3 15:09 gupdatedb -r-xr-xr-x  1 verence  admin   49796 Nov 13 05:03 gxargs Mithos:~ verence$ type gfind gfind is /usr/local/bin/gfind /code/pre  If this is the first time you are using codebrew/code to install software, make sure to include code/usr/local/bin/code in your codePATH/code. There is no need to add other paths for codebrew/code.  <comment212680> You are right! I had this in my PATH. For some reason, the indexing is not working in my Yosemite perfectly. The hashing did not take immediate effect. Now, I can see those commands in my command line after 5 hours waiting. <comment212681> Glad to hear it works now. Indexing isn't required to call a command in Terminal though, but know that it's working for you it doesn't really matter. <comment212682> I've rolled back your edit: Rehashing/indexing is not the issue here, also the sites works better if you don't put the answer into the question text. <comment212684> For me, it matters! I opened a new thread where I summarize the problem which I have noticed in two occasions in my system in nearly low memory states. http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/179448/15504 <comment212685> New thread here http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179448/slow-indexing-and-hashing-in-nearly-low-memory-yosemite
