How do I disable double-vibration when I dock my iPhone? <body> How do I disable double-vibration when I dock my iPhone (6 Plus)?  I am running latest version of iOS, sometimes even the beta one and using Cydia is not an option.  <answer228237> Short of disabling all vibrations (General  Accessibility  Vibration) in Settings, there is no way to accomplish this when running stock iOS, at least AFAIK.
