iPhone 5 doesn’t connect or show up in iTunes <body> I am using a Dell Inspiron 15 3521.  I replace my iPhone 5 with Apple, and my new phone doesn’t show up or connect in iTunes. It doesn’t even show any device as attached. I’ve reinstalled iTunes three or four times, but I’m still having the same problem. Can anyone help?  <answer121591> ul liMake sure that you have correctly entered the pin code and deactivated the device auto-lock feature/li liDo not use a USB hub.
