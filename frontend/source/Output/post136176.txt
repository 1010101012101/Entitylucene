Open port 8888 for HTTP traffic from local network <body> I have my OS X 10.9.3 Application Level Firewall turned on (emFirewall: On/em in emSystem Preferences/em | emSecurity &amp; Privacy/em with emFirewall Options: Block all incoming connections/em).  codeipfw show/code lists a single rule (code65535 0 0 allow ip from any to any/code), which I guess is the normal default (although I wonder if I should impose restrictions also on this level).  Given this initial setup, how can I open port 8888 to HTTP traffic from other devices on my local network (e.g. from code10.0.0.3/code to code10.0.0.2/code) without compromising security unnecessarily?
