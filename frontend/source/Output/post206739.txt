Automate Yosemite Upgrade <body> I want to be able to launch the Yosemite Installer app from the Applications folder and install the upgrade with commands.  When I look inside the InstallESD.img there are many PKG files, I am unsure how to script al this.  I have a way to get the Installer app to the machine and way to launch it. Problem is navigating the options for choosing a volume to install on and the "Continue, restart and agreement" buttons that need clicking.  What automation or scripts exist to simplify this upgrade?  <answer206740> After a search, the open-source munki tool has the script I need.   ul lihttps://github.com/munki/createOSXinstallPkg/li /ul  This works perfectly for my needs. Also, you could do far worse than AutoDMG which does a similar task for restore based workflows.  ul lihttps://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG/li /ul  <comment249209> In many ways, munki is better than the commercial MDM solutions - especially searching and reusing parts you might need.
