Is it possible: Automator workflow for date based file import? <body> I'd like to know if the following is possible with Automator.   I want to be able to move any files, but in my special case videos and photos, from any possible device ( iPhone, iPad, SD card, but perhaps also from other directories) to my NAS, ordered by date. Each file type should have a separate directory, eg.   precodeNAS://imported/video  NAS://imported/photos  /code/pre  What it should also do: within those separate directories, there should be a folder for each date a photo or video will be moved to(and it would also be important that you can customize the date format to codeyy-mm-dd/code , codedd-mm-yy/code or the like, before you run the workflow )   precodeNAS://imported/video/2014-11-04  NAS://imported/video/2014-11-05  /code/pre  Now every video made on november the 5th should be moved to codeNAS://imported/video/2014-11-05/video_file1.mp4/code  I know that it is no problem to move files by type into certain folders, but I dont know how to create date-specific folders for each file before the move-command....   I'm on MacOS 10.10 (Yosemite)  <answer154631> This will be difficult with Automator but it is possible. You will need to augment your Automator workflow with strongRun Script/strong steps involving some other scripting language. That language can be shell script, AppleScript, or another command line capable tool such as perl.  Alternatively, you may find a third party tool like Hazel is able to help:     strongHazel/strong watches whatever folders you tell it to, automatically organizing your files according to the rules you create. It features a rule interface similar to that of Apple Mail so you should feel right at home.   <comment181727> This will be difficult to achieve with only Automator actions. You will likely need some shell script or another scripting language embedded within a **Run Script** action. Are you comfortable with shell script, AppleScript, or another language? <comment181764> Oh what a pity... Well i know some (Korn-)Shell, but not enough to Code something for this use case. Depends on how much world be Automator and how much Shell. But what i reilly not Understand ist hat there is no native OS Solution for Mobbing files likes this (not even in a picture importer like Image Capture). <comment181927> Thanks for the hint to try Hazel, that might be just what i was looking for.
