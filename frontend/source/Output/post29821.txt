Weird renderings of folder names in Finder sidebar <body> I've just upgraded to OSX Lion from Snow Leopard, and started to notice these today in the sidebar of Finder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bwu8J.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you click on them, they go back to normal.  What's going on here?  <comment34206> Have you tried a restart? This kind of glitch is frequently cleared up by something as simple as that.
