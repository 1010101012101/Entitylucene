Macbook Pro Connecting to External Monitor <body> I am wondering why my MacBook pro retina screen gets cut off from the sides while connecting an external monitor. My monitor is LCD 1280 x 1024 resolution connected via display port to VGA adapter. Other monitors I have used with same resolution do not give same issue. Other monitor I tried was bigger in screen size but same resolution. Please explain. I have attached image of what happens. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QN0gI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer285923> From what I can see of your other monitor, it looks like you're in mirroring mode. Go to System Preferences  Displays  toggle "Mirror Displays", or press kbdCmd/kbdkbdF1/kbd (maybe kbdCmd/kbdkbdFn/kbdkbdF1/kbd).  <comment360705> Are you mirroring your output?
