Screen suddenly turns black and comes back to normal operation after about a minute <body> So I was just working as normal when my screen suddenly turned black. I removed and replugged the power adapter, I pressed the on/off button several times, nothing happened. After about 1-2 minutes, the screen comes back to normal operation, as if nothing happened. All programs where open as before, that was not a restart or something.  ul liMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)/li liOX X El Capitan 10.11.6/li /ul  strongWhat was that? Is it a sign for a failure in the near future?/strong  <comment333134> What OS version are you running? Might help to troubleshoot. <comment333153> "comes back as if nothing happened" meaning the screen was just how you left it, or all your apps/documents re-opened from what you were last doing?  You don't have "hot corners" set up by any chance to put the computer to sleep, do  you? <comment333163> It was exactly like I just turned screen brightness instantly down to zero and back to normal after a minute. It was not sleeping probably, as I did not have to enter any password.
