Do I need an developer Account to try Yosemite developer preview (not the public beta)? <body> Do I need to have an active developer account to install and use the current Yosemite Developer Preview 7?    I don't mean the public beta.  <answer144729> strongYes./strong  See developer.apple.com for all the details including information about how to enroll as a developer.  <answer144762> I just tried it and it worked. So you wont need to be listed as developer to install and use the Apple Developer Preview / Beta Builds.  <comment170499> Yes, I saw that and I know how to enroll as developer. But afaik I was able to install & use Mavericks beta as well without an dev account. And apple even didnt hint that it was possible so I asked. Ty <comment170505> You asked for the developer preview. The Mavericks beta versions are more like the public beta of Yosemite. <comment170516> Just tried it. It worked ;-) <comment170517> What URL did you use to download the DP7? (Or perhaps did you redeem a code for it before your developer account expired and are just updating that even though the year has expired?)
