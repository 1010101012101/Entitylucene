Strange wifi behavior across two Macbook Pros - Slow connection, changing available networks <body> I am having intermittent wifi connectivity issues with two Macbook Pros (mid 2012) on my wireless network. I have slow connectivity (request timeouts, dropped packets, etc.) that is always accompanied with a drop in the number of available wifi networks in the wifi drop-down menu. There are usually 10-15 or so visible. When the connectivity problem occurs, only 2-3 will be available, and sometimes the only visible network will be my own. The connectivity issues persist until other networks appear.   I recently replaced the router to try to fix the problem and now have a dual broadcast 5G/2.4G router. This did not fix the problem. It occurs when connected to either 5G or 2.4G. Resetting the router may or may not help (it helps some of the time, but doesn't help enough of the time that I think resetting may not actually do anything).   I have changed the broadcast channel, I have used auto-scan, neither seems to reliably fix it.  <comment81148> Does it happen - or not happen - at specific times of the day?  It sounds like there might be a nearby source of interference.. <comment81153> @Jonathan There's no reliable time component to it. I also suspect it's interference, but why would something interfere across both spectra and why would that mask the number of visible networks? <comment81159> I don't know why it would interfere across both spectra (are you certain that your devices are connected via 5 GHz?)  As for why it would mask the number of visible networks - if the interference is stronger than the base station signal, I don't think it's inconceivable that your computer would lose sight of them. <comment81185> @Jonathan Yes, I've verified that they're connected via 5 GHz. Very frustrating! I'll move the router again and see if it helps, but I'm in an urban area with lots of devices and only one live cable jack.
