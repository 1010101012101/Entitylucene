Failed to mount partition of Mac OS Extended (HFS+) <body> As a matter of fact, my 1 TB External hard disk has three partition: "MAC OS", "NTFS" and "FAT32". All of the partitions worked very well in the past.  However, I just discovered that my Mac OS Extended (HFS+) formatted "MAC OS" partition could not be mounted, although the other two partitions were seemingly fine. I tried to repair the partition with Disk Utility but it failed. I have no idea why this had happened to my hard disk, since I have not done anything disruptive to my hard disk and my MAC OS partition.  I have only done two things before I discovered that my MAC OS partition was no longer working:  ul liI installed the Apple Security Update 2015-002 when my hard disk was plugged into my Macbook air./li liI tried to move some files from my "NTFS" partition to another external hard disk. But it failed because of unknown reason./li /ul  emThis is what I got when I did the "diskutill info" on Terminal:/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Cgam.png" alt="enter image description here" emThis is what I got when I tried to repair my partition:/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n7mzg.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I solve the problem and recover my "MAC OS" partition and get my data back?  <answer176690> Got it back when giving even the hfs+ partition a drive letter in Windows drive-management, did a chkdsk there. (It was an external usb-drive 3Tb)  <comment208600> Looks like the kind of fail I'd hope to have a backup forâ€¦ or at least have [Disk Warrior](http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/) to have a go.
