Autofill password not working on iTunes Connect? <body> Every time I connect on iTunes Connect (OS X 10.10, Chrome) I have to fill in my password, which is very tiring. Chrome autofills all my passwords, why doesn't it work there? Even with the 'remember me' check  <answer218979> The new login of iTunes Connect uses an AJAX form for signing in but does not use a code&lt;form&gt;/code tag for it which prevents Chrome from saving the password.  I was so annoyed that I built a tiny Chrome Extension to fix this issue and allow Chrome to save the password.  <comment265019> it is not working on my side... how can I help make it work ? (Im an experienced programmer but no experience with chrome extensions) console gives two errors : Invalid 'X-Frame-Options' header encountered when loading ... and Unrecognized Content-Security-Policy directive 'frame-options'. <comment265023> @Thomas thanks for helping on this! The error messages originate from the website, not from the extension. Could you please right-click on the email address field and choose "Inspect"? Then in the HTML tree which just opened you go upwards until you find the first "body". It should look like the following image, including the "form": https://www.dropbox.com/s/q2ge336g53qn42k/Screenshot%202015-12-11%2010.08.14.png?dl=0 <comment265170> still not working and yet I see the same as on your picture <comment265173> So the extension is working yet Chrome doesn't offer to save the password? This will be difficult to fix since it works for me without problems. The obvious approach would be to double-check everything, starting with http://superuser.com/a/573625. Also make sure that on chrome://settings/passwords no apple.com website is on the "Never saved" list. Beside that I can only suspect that either a bug or another extension is causing the issue. <comment265180> actually it did ask once to save the password but doesn't autofill it anymore <comment265189> Does it when you select the account's email address from the drop-down list? <comment265293> yes !! thanks for the tip
