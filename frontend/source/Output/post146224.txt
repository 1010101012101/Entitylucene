iPhone 4 Filters won't show up on Instagram <body> When I take a photo with my camera and use a filter, I try to upload it to Instagram but it doesn't recognize the filter. It just shows the pic without the filter.  <answer146231> This is a known behaviour for pictures edited from camera or photos app on iOS. When you try to load the picture onto Instagram, It loads the original version of the picture (emwithout any filter/em) that was taken.  If you want the picture with iOS Camera filters - Screenshot the picture once you apply the filter and load the screenshot-ed picture on Instagram.
