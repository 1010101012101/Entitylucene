iCloud file permission keep switching from 0400 to 0444 <body> I have some files on my iCloud account that need codechmod 400 filename/code, but iCloud keeps switching the rights back to code444/code.  ol liWhy it is doing that./li liIs it possible to set a file permission once, and force the system to keep it that way?/li /ol  Tech spec:  ul liEl Capitan/li liv10.11.6 (15G1004)/li /ul  <comment313374> When you say "on [your] iCloud account", do you mean files that are in iCloud that you are changing permissions on locally through iCloud Drive? <comment313522> Correct.
