Deleting srt files from vlc app in iPad Mini <body> I have installed VLC app in my iPad Mini and have been enjoying movies. But the srt files I have transferred to my iPad cannot be removed even after I have deleted the movies from my iPad.   Before there were only some files, so it was not a problem for me but now it's been a mess. I tried to delete it from the iPad but the files aren't visible there. I don't have Macbook. I tried to delete via Windows, but the delete option doesn't work.
