Looking for solution to make iPad kid-friendly <body> We have an iPad, which is used by my wife and me as well as our two kids.  We would like to prevent the kids from using certain apps, and restrict browsing to certain websites.  The "Restrictions" feature basically works, but it's utterly impractical to have to go into the Settings every time after our kids use the iPad.  ol liIs there any way to quickly toggle restrictions on/off with a passcode?/li liFailing that, is there a way to "lock down" certain apps so they cannot be opened without a passcode? (There is such an app, but for jailbroken devices only; is there one for non-jailbroken?)/li liIs there a browser alternative which allows restricting sites, but allows access to all with a passcode? (In the past I used the "K9 safe browser" but it was ugly as sin.)/li /ol  Note: We do NOT want to jailbreak; I know that with jailbreak there are all kinds of solutions, but jailbreaking caused too many issues.  Ideally we need user profiles ... which amazingly iPad does not have. Might need to switch to an Android tablet.  <comment145888> To be clear: `Settings  General  Restrictions  Enable Restrictions` is impractical? Or are there more steps than that? <comment145891> Yeah, that's way too much hassle. It's like six taps to disable, then again to enable. I wish there were a little toggle in the quick settings pull up from the bottom. <comment145895> I was hoping there'd be a way using url schemes, but it looks like Settings access via "prefs:" has been removed for a while (like since ios 5) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4496813/call-the-official-settings-app-from-my-app-on-iphone
