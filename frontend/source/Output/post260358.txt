Upgraded to Sierra - Where did all of my files go? <body> I've upgraded to Sierra a little while back. I wasn't a fan of using iCloud drive, so I did my best to have it not back up my files there. I only use the Mac for iOS Dev, and I was able to program after I first upgrade. Last night I did the next recommended Sierra update but emdidn't/em turn on iCloud and ALL of my project files in Documents went emmissing/em.  So, I re-enabled iCloud hoping they would pop back in. They did not. My dev folder in Documents contains the folder structure of what the project directory looks like but all of my source files are gone.  All My Files in finder reveals that there are still files emsomewhere/em.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/94hq3.png" alt="enter image description here"  But Get Info shows they are in a weird place that I have no idea how to get to.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/39s1E.png" alt="enter image description here"  I also cannot see these files in my iCloud drive. So the question remains, where did all of my files go?  <comment325947> When you login to iCloud.com do you see them there?  Maybe they're still syncing to the cloud servers? <comment325949> @fsb Negative. iCloud.com shows the same results as my computer. There is a folder structure but the folders are all empty. <comment325960> As far as I know, the update actually automatically turns it on again - if you have chosen not to enable having desktop and documents in iCloud Drive. Unfortunately :-(
