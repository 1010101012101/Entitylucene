Inverting mouse axis using Karabiner <body> Karabiner seems like an extremely versatile piece of software, but I can't seem to find a way to invert the mouse axis with it. For example: When I move the mouse downwards I want the cursor to go upwards, and when I move the mouse to the right, I want the cursor to go left.sup(*)/sup  Right now I'm using USB Overdrive for this purpose, but I need Karabiner for other stuff, and it would be nice if I could get away with just one program.  sup(*) This sounds so strange that I feel I owe you an explanation: I have a trackball mouse which, due to it's form factor forces me to turn it 180 degrees on my desk. By inverting the axis in software, it still moves naturally./sup  <answer267710> To flip cursor movement you can use a third party tool: Karabiner. Karabiner isn't compatible with Sierra at the time of writing (January 2017).  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;3rd-Party Pointing Device&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Reverse Vertical &amp;amp; Horizontal Cursor Movement&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;reverse.mouse.movement&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;           __FlipPointingRelative__           Option::FLIPPOINTINGRELATIVE_HORIZONTAL,           Option::FLIPPOINTINGRELATIVE_VERTICAL,         &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  If you already have other items in private.xml omit the first two and the last line of the above code./li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the remapping.

Example (sorry, only an Apple external keyboard):  precode&lt;devicevendordef&gt;     &lt;vendorname&gt;Apple&lt;/vendorname&gt;     &lt;vendorid&gt;0x05ac&lt;/vendorid&gt; &lt;/devicevendordef&gt; &lt;deviceproductdef&gt;     &lt;productname&gt;ExternalKeyboard&lt;/productname&gt;     &lt;productid&gt;0x0256&lt;/productid&gt; &lt;/deviceproductdef&gt; ... &lt;device_only&gt;DeviceVendor::Apple, DeviceProduct::ExternalKeyboard&lt;/device_only&gt; /code/pre  You get the various device IDs by opening Karabiner  Misc. &amp; Uninstall  EventViewer  Devices  <comment335963> Karabiner lets you modify how your keyboard, keys, keyboard layouts, and key combinations behave. It is not designed to modify the mouse. <comment335968> @timothymh Wrong! it works after some investigation! <comment335970> Why the downvote? I've done a lot of research before posting, the question is clear, judging from other questions and meta-discussions it seems on topic. <comment335971> Amazing. You found it. Precisely what I was looking for. Tested it and confirmed that it works.
