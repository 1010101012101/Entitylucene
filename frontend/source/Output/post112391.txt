iPad email client doesn't refresh the "new" count in icon <body> I had a bunch of old emails in my email client on iPad (v3, iOS 7).  I wanted to delete them all, so I marked them and accidentally selected "mark as unread". Ok, no biggie I thought. I marked them again and then finally clicked "delete".  It turns out that now I have 0 emails (0 in incoming, 0 in trash, 0 generally), but the client says I have 164 unread messages. It writes this in the app and in the icon (as the overlay number). Why?  I tried restarting the app and the iPad â€” nothing. I just have 164 messages according to the email client that I can't find.
