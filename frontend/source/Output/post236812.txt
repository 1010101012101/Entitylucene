My Mac Mini HD been wiped out <body> Here is the scenario: I was bouncing music and got a warning Macintosh HD is almost full! By the time I empty the trash my my froze. So I restart it and that infinite white progress bar below the gorgeous Apple never end progressing.  I reboot in single user and tried a fsck check but in seem to only check for OS X base system which appear OK.  Tried the verbose and got stuck within a pause.  Then tried to reach for my users in terminal within recovery booting and there was nothing there, no users, no hidden files, nothing but a .forward and a Library. I didn't cried !  I'm ok with the reality of a Hardware failure. I'm not so ok with the fact of loosing music that I made that came out of the blue from spontaneous inspiration. So for this last part, I will do everything necessary to get to those files.  So I started my OLD MB Pro (2007) and FW target boot from it. Here's what disk Utility have to tell about it;  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2q2L.jpg" alt="Disk utility lecture of my Mac-mini from my MBP"  Any cue is more then welcome   <answer236825> Use Internet Recovery on your Mac Mini and try repairing codeMacintosh HD/code with codeDisk Utility/code.br If that fails to fix the boot issue, connect your Mac Mini in target disk mode to a mac running OS X 10.8 or later and see if you can at least copy the files off your Fusion Drive.br In the future, set up a Time Machine.  <comment289896> Is that a Fusion Drive? <comment289897> I'm wondering if those _incompatible format_  are in there because Disk Utilty on my old Mac cannot read new disk format ? <comment289899> Fusion Drive is supported starting with OS X Mountain Lion (2012). <comment289901> @Nikita probably but in 2 Volumes ? <comment289903> '/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    0:      GUID_partition_scheme  *121.3 GB   disk0    1:         EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:         Apple_CoreStorage Internal Drive          121.0 GB   disk0s2    3:         Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3' <comment289904> '/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    0:          GUID_partition_scheme             *1.0 TB     disk1    1:          EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Internal Drive          999.3 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3' <comment289905> /dev/disk2 (disk image):    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +2.1 GB     disk2    1:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        2.0 GB     disk2s1 /dev/disk3 (internal, virtual):    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +1.1 TB     disk3 Logical Volume on disk1s2, disk0s2             DBB5212A-2FA1-4EF4-B282-862BD5AD19A5             Unencrypted Fusion Drive <comment289906> Well that's the idea of a Fusion Drive, isn't it? You get two devices—an SSD and an HDD—in a single volume. Looks like you have a 1TB fusion drive and your MacBook doesn't recognize it since it seems to be running 10.5 Leopard, not 10.8 Mountain Lion. <comment289907> I just don't know Fusion drive architecture, but to make it short I see that there is a An Apple boot recovery HD. Does this mean that there is still life on my HD ? <comment289908> I don't know how the internet recovery works but I supposed that if my HD is dead it just cannot take room on my HD no matter what ! <comment289911> There's a recovery partition and there's [internet recovery](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314), two different things. Internet recovery doesn't use your disk and stores it's image in memory. <comment289913> That's what i'm trying to figure out. If I can see that recovery partition it means that my HD still work somehow <comment289914> I tried Internet recovery, it don't see the disk :-( And unfortunately I was working on too much big files so I needed to redo my rules for my TimeMachine but this happen before I had the chance to do it. <comment289915> Does anyone know a way fix that blinded partition ? <comment289917> Without the disk utility app
