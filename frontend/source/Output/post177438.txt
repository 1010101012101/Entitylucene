Restore whole system on 10.10 with time machine <body> I realized that I somehow deleted some very important files on my computer. I am working with QGIS and I deleted (in my python system's native folder) some eggs and other things which led to the inconvenient outcome that my QGis is not working anymore...  Luckily, I have a backup from yesterday night.  My question: Can I restore my whole system from that backup? Basically, I want a clean set up with 10.10 and then, all my installed C++ compilers, libraries for Python, plug ins and so forth back on it again.. Is that possible? If so, how?   <answer177476> Restart, hold down kbdCommand/kbd + kbdR/kbd while booting to get to the restore screen. You can pick your backup from there.  From support site  <comment210053> thanks! never touch a running system.... That just went good.
