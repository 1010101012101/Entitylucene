IOS messages - contacts with both IOS and text messaging <body> So my kids all have "dumb" phones and iOS devices (iPods, iPads). Currently, I only have one contact per person, with both their iOS device and regular phone number as part of their contact.   Unfortunately, I can't tell if I'm getting a message from their phone or iOS device. If they are on their iOS device, I can send them links, images, etc... but if their are on their phone, I can only send text messages.   Apart from creating 2 contacts for each person (one for their phone, one for their iOS device) is there any other way to tell these apart?  <answer124926> So long as your children have iMessage turned on codeSettings.app &gt; Messages &gt; Turn iMessage *on*/code, you can determine which device you are messaging based on the strongcolor/strong of your message bubble backgrounds or, in your specific example, the "Send" button color (while typing):   strongGreen/strong = non-iOS dumb phones.   strongBlue/strong = iOS devices.   <comment146210> Not quite sure that’s what you’re asking, but the background of a text message is green text messages while its blue for iMessages. <comment146214> I can't believe I never noticed that before! thanks for the great explanation!
