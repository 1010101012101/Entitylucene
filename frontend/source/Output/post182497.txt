how long does it take to synch across devices <body> I've imported 1,000 photos into Photos on my Mac, and my settings are "Store in iCloud", it is over an hour since I did the import and when I log into iCloud.com via Safari I can see the photos there in Photos however they do not show on my iPhone 6 (logged into the same iCloud account) which has iOS 8.3 and uses Photos. I wonder how long does it take to synch to my devices or is there another step I need to take to get it to synch.  <comment217296> Just to clarify, you also turned iCloud Photo Library on in Settings  iCloud  Photos on your iPhone 6? Just being logged into iCloud does not enable iCloud Photo Library. You must explicitly do so on each device where you wish to use it. <comment217303> Yep, thx, it was switched on, interestingly it said Low Disk Space,18 item to upload, I freed up some space (now have 400Mb free) and it says "18 items to upload". I wonder if it needs to complete this first before it will start to synch with the rest. <comment217304> In my experience it uploads before downloading, yes.
