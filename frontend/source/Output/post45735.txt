Can sudo use my existing aliases? <body> How can I let codesudo/code use my existing aliases in my .bash_profile (or .bashrc, .profile â€¦)? For example I want to be able to use codell/code instead of codels -laGF/code as codesudo/code.  <answer45743> No. Sudo draws from the root account and won't consult your user's code~/.bash_profile/code.  But you can workaround this problem by adding the following alias to your profile:  precodealias sudo='sudo ' /code/pre  *Note the space after the command. From then on, codesudo/code will work normally and you'll be able to use your user's aliases without issue (both normally and with root privileges).  hr  strongExplanation:/strong http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Aliases says:     If the last character of the alias value is a space or tab character, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.   <answer97275> alias sudo='sudo su -i ENV=/home/myuser/.profile'  <comment52115> I suppose you meant to type `alias sudo='sudo ', since that works! Change your answer accordingly and I will accept it. <comment52144> @Asmus yes sorry. Fixed.
