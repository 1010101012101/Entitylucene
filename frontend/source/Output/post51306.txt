ls output does not have color while SSHing to another machine with iTerm2, but does with Terminal <body> Just as the title says, when I codessh/code to my work Fedora server with iTerm2 I don't get color codels/code output. When I codessh/code to the same server with OS X's default Terminal app, codels/code color output works just fine.   EDIT: All other codels/code output is colorized properly. Both iTerm2 and Terminal display codels/code locally as colored, and Terminal works properly when SSH'd over to the work machine.  The only time I'm not getting colorized codels/code output is when I use iTerm2 to SSH to my work machine. Terminal produces colorized codels/code output when SSH'd to my work machine and so does PuTTY on Windows.   When SSH'd into my work machine from iTerm2 'ls -G' also makes no difference. Still no coloration on ls output.  Also, when SSH'd to my work machine from iTerm2, the emonly/em thing I'm not seeing color on is the output of codels/code. My prompt is colorized, codevim/code works with color, and if I codeecho $TERM/code I see codexterm-256color/code.   Any ideas?  <answer51307> codels/code output with colors (codels -G/code) is not the default option. Run the following command in your terminal to enable ls colors by default:  precodeecho "alias ls='ls -G'" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc /code/pre  This and all future terminal sessions will now display colors correctly.  hr  If you're still not seeing colors on your remote (or local) session follow these steps:  In iTerm verify that you're sending a terminal type that supports colors. Open the preferences window - Profiles - Default - Terminal. I'd recommend putting codexterm-256color/code as the Terminal Type.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bziz2.jpg" alt="Terminal Preferences"  While connected to the remote machine, run codels -G/code and open the iTerm preferences again: preferences window - profiles - Default - Colors. Adjust the ANSI Colors, and turn the emminimum contrast/em down until the colors in the terminal window start to show color.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RevNl.jpg" alt="Terminal Colors"  If the remote system supports codels --color=always/code, remove any existing aliases in ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc and update as follows:  precodeecho "alias ls='ls --color=always'" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc /code/pre  <answer54770> I had the same problem. I found that the color theme I used in iTerm (solarized) redefined the colors codels/code used on the ssh host making them impossible to tell apart.  You can try the following to check whether it's not the case for you:  precodeLS_COLORS="di=07;31" ls    # this will list directories as black on red  /code/pre  If this does show colors, you might need to redefine colors on the linux machine. The following command defines (some) ls colors to be similar to the OS-X defaults:  precodeLS_COLORS="di=00;34:ln=00;35:so=00;32:pi=01;33:ex=00;31:bd=00;34" ls /code/pre  To edit the colors on linux, see the dircolors man page. You can also read the following on how to set colors from .bashrc: https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized#installation  <comment58649> Sorry, I should have been more specific. I've edited my post accordingly. <comment58652> Yes, I am currently reporting `xterm-256color` as my terminal. I'm updating my original question again with further info. <comment58654> See my latest updates, concerning ANSI colors and the minimum contrast settings. I had to do something similar, IIRC I adjusted the "Bright" ANSI colors to match "Normal"... or maybe the other way around. Give it a shot and let me know if that fixes it. <comment58655> Minimum contrast is already at lowest setting, what do you mean by adjusting the ANSI colors? Should I just try moving them around until I see some colored output? <comment58656> That's what I would recommend, again, I think I had to do the same thing when connecting to an Ubuntu machine running under screen. If that works I'll update the answer with how you fixed it. <comment58670> Any further ideas? <comment58671> What version of iTerm are you using? <comment58676> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/3431/discussion-between-aaron-lake-and-pumpinglemma)
