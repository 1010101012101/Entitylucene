Set custom resolution to external monitor <body> I've just bought for few euros an used pivot monitor.   The problem is that if I rotate the monitor of 90° using display preferences I get black rows on top and on the bottom.  I would like to know if there's a way to solve this problem from terminal.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fsNa0.jpg" alt="black rows"  <comment287467> Have your tried setting the Rotation to 270° in System Preferences  Displays, for that Display? <comment287468> It's the same result on tje other side of course
