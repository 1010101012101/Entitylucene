I have found an old list, from back in 1998 before OS X. It might help you in the right direction even though it isn't quite the exact answer you're looking for.  If an errorcode is deprecated it won't be replaced by a new cause, because that would only make it much more difficult to keep track of these numbers used in OS X and prior.   <answer147938> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CjSjl.jpg" alt="Apple Internal Document on Shut Down codes"  This is the codes we used to use when I worked there  <answer195236> I filed a bug report with Apple about the cryptic numbers, and eventually got this response:     Engineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based   on the following information:      If your looking for more sleep/wake related info, "pmset -g log" is   the place to go, not the system.log everything behaves correctly.      If you have questions regarding this resolution, please update your   bug report with that information.      We are now closing this bug report.      Please be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates   that might affect this issue.   In summary: they recommend using the command codepmset -g log/code to diagnose sleep issues rather than looking at the system log.  <answer219505> So the kbase articles on System Error codes date back to the days of PowerPC processors, which apparently needed a lot more bits to report all of the potential hardware errors that could cause a shutdown. Starting with the advent of Intel boards, all shutdowns are tagged with an 8-bit code, if the normal software shutdown flags are not recorded. A positive code indicates a software or HID initiated shutdown, while a negative code (in the range of -1 to -127) indicates hardware-related Intel SMC-initiated shutdown. A -128 shutdown code indicates a hardware-related shutdown of unknown cause.  The 0 shutdown code resides in a liminal space between the hardware and the user; it signifies a sudden loss of power which can either be caused by a hardware failure or user action (if you want to demonstrate this for yourself, try popping the battery out of an old MacBook or MacBook Pro while it's on and unplugged, or pulling the power cord out of an iMac while it's running, then rebooting the computer and checking Console.app. A 0 Sleep Cause results when a MacBook/Pro/Air puts itself into SafeSleep using the last bit of reserve battery power before full system shutdown in order to preserve the contents of RAM in the  precode/var/vm/sleepimage /code/pre  file. Unless you happen to connect your MagSafe adapter immediately after the computer goes to sleep, this code is pretty well guaranteed to be followed a 0 Shutdown Cause in the system.log.  Some of the hardware shutdown codes are unique to specific models of computer depending on their configuration because they refer to a specific sensor or device that exists only in that model– when I worked for Apple we were told that Intel was responsible for assigning the codes and wasn't particularly free with the information sharing on that count, even with Apple Engineering. So we pretty much had to figure out the obscure ones on our own.  Previous Shutdown Cause 5 and 3 are holdovers from the PowerPC days- because they're initiated by the user, the OS is still responsible for reporting them.   Code 5 is a clean, user initiated software shutdown, e.g. by selecting Shut Down from the  menu, or pressing the power button and selecting Shut Down in the pop-up window, or holding down kbdcontrol/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdeject/kbd, or typing  precodesudo halt /code/pre  at the command prompt. Similarly, a Previous Sleep Cause of 5 indicates any clean user-initiated sleep, from the  menu or a hot corner or the command line or closing the lid and triggering the hall-effect sensor in the top case of a MacBook/Pro/Air.  Code 3 is a "dirty" Shutdown, which can be caused by any user-initiated Reboot of the computer, or by forcing a hardware computer halt by holding down the power button for 5+ seconds.  <answer255401> The precise meaning of the codes is not publicly documented, although according to @grgarside's website for strongShutdown Causes/strong, the causes for the ones listed in the question are:  ul listrong5/strong/li /ul     strongCorrect Shut Down./strong Shutdown was initiated, from the OS X Shut Down menu or other shutdown command.

The most recent edition of that old list is probably [Macintosh: System Error Codes Explained](http://support.apple.com/kb/TA44464), archived by Apple. <comment148306> @GrahamPerrin you could make your comment in to a answer! <comment233081> I would doubt McOS =9 info is relevant to anything here - the kernel etc was running as NeXT from 1989 and I think would use these values rather than changing to the OS =9 <comment265594> Thanks! So 3 would result from a forced restart (Command–Control–Power button), yes? <comment279330> Those are unrelated — they're classic OS (now Carbon) error codes. They're used for application-level API error codes; even in the classic OS they weren't used to identify system crashes.
