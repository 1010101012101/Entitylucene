AppleScript curl response is always empty <body> I am sending user input to my server via an Applescript:  My curl is sending the user input correctly and I am checking against my database to see if there is a match.  I am returning true or false in my PHP script.  On my server when I enter the correct email and productKey it returns true but when I display the response of the curl in my Applescript it always returns empty.  And then it displays "Failed" from my if statement.  It seems even though my server shows a true response that my curl is not grabbing that value as its response for some reason.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.        strongAPPLESCRIPT/strong  precodeset email to the text returned of (display dialog "Enter in your Email:" default answer "") set productKey to the text returned of (display dialog "Enter in your  Product Key:" default answer "") display dialog "Email: " &amp; email &amp; " Product Key: " &amp; productKey  set domain to "myurl.com" set keyURL to domain &amp; "/product.php?email=" &amp; email &amp; "&amp;productKey=" &amp; productKey &amp; "" set curlURL to (do shell script "curl " &amp; keyURL)  open location keyURL display dialog keyURL display dialog curlURL  if curlURL = "true" then  display dialog "We made it"  else display dialog "Failed"  end if /code/pre  strongPHP/strong  precode&lt;?php  if(isset($_GET["email"]) &amp;&amp; isset($_GET["productKey"])) {  $email  = $_GET["email"]; $productKey = $_GET["productKey"];  }  if(!empty($email) &amp;&amp; !empty($productKey)){  $query = "SELECT * FROM users where email = '".$email."'

Does the fully qualified `curl` commands match and does the manually executed `curl` command in Terminal return the expected value? Also, does it make any difference if you use `the quoted form of keyURL` vs. just  `keyURL` in the `do shell script ...` command? <comment353143> @bjbk, In regards to your comment... As the `set keyURL to domain & ...` command is written, it is not at all necessary and it makes absolutely no difference that it's there as it's literally concatenating nothing to the end past the value of `productKey` in the `set keyURL to domain & ...` command. <comment353144> @user3439894 thanks. <comment353149> Ive tried it both with and without the empty string concatenation...still the same result. <comment353159> @Nick, The concatenation at the end of the `set keyURL to domain & ...` command is not at al relevant as it does absolutely nothing to begin with anyway, as I mentioned to bjbk, however please answer the questions I've asked in my first comment.
