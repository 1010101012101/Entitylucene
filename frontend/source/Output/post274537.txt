MacBook doesn't boot from Windows 10 External HDD, but other macs do <body> So I followed all the instructions on Alex Labert's answer here: Is it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?  I had installed Windows 10 to an external HDD for booting with any computer. It has so far worked on my mac mini perfectly fine, and two 2 windows laptops. My macbook detects it as a bootable source when I hold alt at startup, but all I get is a black screen when I actually boot from it. Any ideas on what I should do? Any help is appreciated.
