Issues with charging my iPhone 5C <body> So I recently I have had various issues with charging my iPhone 5C. Some troubleshooting led me to these conclusions: first symptom I noticed is that it will only charge once the battery is dead. The other symptom is that I tried a non-Apple USB to charge my phone and it will only charge from dead to about 4% battery life, and using my damaged cable charges the phone just as fine, but also after the batter's been dead. Using an Apple charger with non-Apple USB cable also seems to work and charge the phone okay. I'm really confused as to what's going on with my phone, but I'm confused.  Thanks in future for any help!
