Getting "Invalid year." error while trying to Apple ID password from my iPad <body> I'm trying to change my Apple ID password from my iPad, but I'm getting an error saying "Invalid year.":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5vXsK.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can't find any information on that error from Google, only a few threads where people are complaining about the same problem.  The date and time on my iPad are correct - April the 7th 2014 at the time of this question, so it's not that.  <comment148504> You've checked the one thing I would on iPad. What happens if you log in to appleid.apple.com from a browser and check the personal details on the account in question? <comment148514> @bmike I can log in, but what should I look for? There's a [menu](http://imgur.com/FCF1cfh) with various info. <comment148552> Being able to log in is the main test. Sorry it wasn't something easily fixable on the server side.
