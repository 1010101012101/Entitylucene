How to uninstall individual Office365 components in Mac OS X <body> There is [un]surprisingly little or no useful information I could find on uninstalling individual components when you install the full Office365 suite on your Mac.  All I want is Word and Excel, and want to get rid of the rest. Shall I just send the apps to the Bin? Thanks  <answer171523> Just trash the apps you no longer want.  Office 2011 no longer uses a dedicated uninstaller.  See this Microsoft support document for more information.  <comment201805> Does that also applies to the Office 365 ? <comment201808> are you the Office365 administrator? https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn745895.aspx <comment201951> It does, you simply need to deactivate your license first. <comment204974> Marked it as answer, I trashed the apps I didn't use and nothing exploded. I don't get how Microsoft can get away with being stuck in the 90s and survive in this time and age. <comment204976> from the link I gathered that that option is for installing office 2013 and thus it's meant for Windows
