How can I enlarge the Macâ€™s preview window? <body> Pressing codespace/code on a selected file in emFinder/em evokes a preview window. Can I enlarge the size of this window emby default/em to get a larger preview e.g. of images?  <answer229918> You should be able to click/drag the corners of the Quick Look window. I at least know you can in OS X El Capitan.  <comment280560> This works once but the question is about setting a default.
