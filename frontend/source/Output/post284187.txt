What's the difference between "loving" a song and clicking a song's heart in iTunes? <body> I'm finally experimenting with an iTunes Music subscription, hoping to find music I like based on what I already like.  iTunes seems to have two ways to express my opinion on a song I'm listening to in iTunes Music:  ul liI can select a song and, two-finger click on is and select either "Love" or "Disklike".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qxMlp.png" alt=""/li liSeparately, I can hover to the left of the song and a heart outline heart will appear, and I can click this, which fills the heart in with red. Clicking again toggles it back.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIX7r.png" alt=""/li /ul  These two actions seem to be independent. "Loving" a song doesn't turn the heart on, turning the heart on doesn't "love" a song.  What do these two things indicate? Which one, if either, will make it more likely that iTunes Music will suggest songs that I might like?  <answer284188> It's the same thing. Unfortunately there appears to be a bug where the UI doesn't update one when you select the other, but it's stored the same and will appear the same next time iTunes refreshes that playlist/etc.  <comment358360> How does one get iTunes to refresh the play list? I went elsewhere in the interface and returned to the playlist, as well as quit iTunes and went back to the playlist. My "loves" were retained, but not the hearts. <comment358362> @Chuck I've just tried it and I had to quit iTunes completely and relaunch it. It's definitely a recent bug which should mean it'll be fixed soon.
