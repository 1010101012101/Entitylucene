I how to do I keep my Apple Watch's screen on longer? <body> Sometimes my Apple Watch's screen dims while I'm still using it. How do I keep the screen on longer?  <answer206786> On watchOS 2, you can change the duration the display stays on.  The setting is in the codeSettings/code icon on the Watch itself and in the codeWatch/code app on the paired iPhone. Go to codeGeneral &gt; Wake Screen/code and you can switch between 15 or 70 seconds under the codeOn Tap/code section (you will need to scroll down on the Watch).   <answer206788> Watch OS 2.x allows two options.  (Perhaps in future this can be a single dynamic option with a min-max setting.)  ul liGo to strongWatch App/strong on strongiPhone/strong/li liTap strongGeneral/strong/li liTap strongWake Screen/strong/li liSelect the strongON TAP/strong Wake setting desired  ul liWake for 15 Seconds/li liWake for 70 Seconds hr / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qbUDcl.png" alt="Watch OS General Settings Wake Screen"/li /ul/li /ul
