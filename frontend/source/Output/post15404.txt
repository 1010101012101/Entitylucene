Optimal keyboard shortcut for keyboard layout switching on OS X? <body> Considering that Spotlight is already using kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdspace/kbd and that you cannot use combination of modifiers alone, I would like to see an ergonimic alternative.  I can't use the following combinations due to conflicts with other software  ul likbdctrl/kbd+kbdspace/kbd - auto-complete in IDEA/li /ul  <answer15405> I use kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd\/kbd (next to Enter). Works fine for me.  <answer15407> I use kbdctrl/kbd + kbdspace/kbd which is may be the best option I found out to be useful and ergonomic.  <answer15411> I'm using kbd&#x2325;/kbd + kbd&#x2318;/kbd + kbdspace/kbd as it doesn't trigger autocomplete in Eclipse, Idea or Quicksilver/Spotlight/Alfred.  <answer15417> I use kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdC/kbd to trigger my clipboard manager.  I haven't found it overlapping any other keyboard shortcut, and the keys are close enough to be pressed using one hand (the thumb for the modifiers and the index for "C")  <answer19825> I use kbdctrl/kbd + kbd&#x2325;/kbd + kbdspace/kbd. It's typeable via left hand, doesn't collide with the search window shortcut (as kbd&#x2325;/kbd + kbd&#x2318;/kbd + kbdspace/kbd does) and I haven't found any other overlap yet.  <answer19993> How about kbdctrl/kbd + kbd`/kbd (backtick)  Easy to type that with your left hand.  <answer19999> What's wrong with the default kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E5;/kbd? (or kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E5;/kbd to switch in the opposite order)?  It's perfectly ergonomic to have your thumb on the kbd&#x2318;/kbd key and use on of your others to press the kbd&#x21E5;/kbd key.  <answer20374> I use kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd for "global" keyboard shortcuts.  kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd +kbdS/kbd seems like a good "switch" shortcut.  You could probably also use kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdF[1-12]/kbd key if you install Apptivate [$3 on the Mac App Store].  <answer20386> I've always been using kbdCmd/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbd//kbd and been pretty happy with it. I don't remember having any conflict with any app.  <comment16711> I was hopping to a combination that uses only the left hand :) <comment16713> @Sorin: it's possible to press it with right hand altogether, using right-Cmd and right-Shift keys :-). I've just tried it, but I have to admit, it's not very "hand"-friendly (I use left hand for cmd and shift keys). <comment16715> Unfortunately this conflicts with Eclipse/XCode code completion :-( <comment16719> I assume you have and addional `\\` key on your keyboard between Shift and Z ... but this is not my case. <comment16722> @Sorin: I have additional \ key next to Enter key, just above right shift key (http://i53.tinypic.com/2jdkiew.png) I think this is what Apple calls "International keyboard layout". <comment22057> that's the default to open a knew finder search window...
