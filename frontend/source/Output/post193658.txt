Wi-Fi Network only appears after I connect to another Wi-Fi network <body> This is a very intriguing problem. Every time I'll connect my MacBook Air mid 2013 with OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 to my wi-fi network at home, I can't, cause it won't be available in the list of networks available.  What I do? I turn no my Android tethering hotspot, and only after I connect to this network, my home wi-fi will be shown.   What might it be???  <answer193661> The first part is for testing.  You need to use the terminal and manually connect to it.  Turn On  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on /code/pre  Find (you can skip this if you already know the Name)  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport scan /code/pre  Connect  precodenetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 WIFI_SSID_I_WANT_TO_JOIN WIFI_PASSWORD /code/pre  Enter/replace your WiFi name and password in the above.  This should have connected you to your Network.  ul liIn your Network settings your home network should be in the top of the list. /li liOpen your router settings and change the network name to test if problem with naming. While in Router setting, change the channel to #5 (usually the least crowded one) to eliminate interferences./li liFinally, run WiFi diagnostics, by holding the "alt" key and clicking on the WiFi icon, then selecting the WiFi Diagnostics./li /ul
