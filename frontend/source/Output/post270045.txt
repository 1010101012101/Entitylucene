How make Safari open XML file instead of downloading it <body> I'm on MacOS Sierra.  When I click on a link to XML file, Safari downloads it.  Instead I want to view the XML right in the browser.  Is there a way to accomplish this?  <answer270298> Safari emdoes/em open XML files, unless the server specifically tells Safari to download the file.br It's currently not possible to override the server's instruction to download instead of view.  <comment339307> Safari seems to show XML files as XML, at least for me. Could you try viewing [this](http://mesu.apple.com/assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_SoftwareUpdate/com_apple_MobileAsset_SoftwareUpdate.xml)? <comment339322> I was able to view it!  Oddly, when I try to open any maven-metadata.xml in my company's internal Artifactory repo, it promptly downloads it.
