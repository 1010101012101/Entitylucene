Combine sound such as MP3 to video MOV in OS X? <body> I need to combine a movie without sounds and a MP3 file. How can I do it in OS X? I have Adobe After Effects but it is not at all intuitive to use -- or better I need to find some button to render the sounds with the movie but now no time -- is there some easy fast-to-use software for OS X to combine sounds and videos?  <answer91454> strongAdobe After Effects/strong  I remembered now how to do it in After Effects: codeComposition &gt; Add to Render Queue/code and then click codelossless/code and put the cross to the audio thing. Now specify the target and then hit codeRender/code.  A good video here how to do it.  <answer91455> iMovie is the obvious choice. It's very easy to use and fairly reasonable in price. You might have it already if you have a newish mac or else it's $15 I think.  http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/  <answer91520> ffmpeg supports combining video and audio without re-encoding:  precodeffmpeg -i input.mov -i input.mp3 -c copy -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -shortest output.mov /code/pre  code-map 0:0/code means input file 0, stream 0. code-c copy/code copies video and audio codecs. code-shortest/code makes the combined file as long as the shorter file.  <comment107412> Yet this solution is taking pretty long time do, hopefully someone able to provide a more casual way. <comment107413> Awesome! Thank you so Apple way, clever -- worked like a charm without After Effect's slow rendering. Not professional thing but works :) <comment262826> The best and fastest choice to combine or merge audio and video files without re-encoding. Really useful. Thanks a lot!
