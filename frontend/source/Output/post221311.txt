Install Mavericks on Mac Mini with a completly formatted hard disk <body> I have an older Mac Mini with Snow Leopard installed on it. When I was upgrading to Mavericks, the installation was stuck and the MacMini didn't start any more.br I didn't know about Recovery etc. So I've formatted the whole hard disk in order to reinstall Mavericks following this tutorial. I've downloaded it from the AppStore with my other Mac to do all the stuff explained in this tutorial.br So I've restored the InstallMaverick.dmg, which is contained in the InstallMavericks.app, on a usb stick with disk utility and tried to boot it on my screwed Mac Mini. But with the StartUp-Manager that I've started with the alt-Key there were no disks visible.br I only see the WiFi-Selection, but nothing more!br Does someone know what to do to get Mavericks or Snow Leopard reinstalled on a Mac Mini like mine, that has no recovery partition any more?br Thanks in advance!br strongEdit:/strongbr I don't have the Snow Leopard DVD any more. Just borrowed my former boss of a company I've worked before and never get back. I've downloaded strongInstall OS X Mavericks.app/strong from the AppStore. And the real name of the DMG-File is strongInstallESD.dmg/strong, which is in the package in the ShardSupport-Folder.br You'll see what I've tried if you have a look on the tutorial:br http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/17/make-bootable-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion-usb-install-drive/br I wonder why I can't see no disks when I start the startup manager by pressing the alt-Key.br Even the hard disk is not listed!br PS: I'm that desperate that I've even tried to install Windows 8 just to have any use for that device. emThank God, that I have two other Macs (Mac Mini Late 2012 and MacBookPro)./em  <comment267961> Do you still have the DVD with the original OS? <comment267964> There are no legitimate files named "InstallMaverick.dmg" or "InstallMavericks.app". <comment267977> @user3439894 I've edited my post and wrote the real file names in bold letters. <comment267980> Have you tried using [DiskMaker X](http://diskmakerx.com) to create the USB Installer?
