Restore TimeMachine emails from Mavericks Mail app to Snow Leopard Mail app <body> Early 2008 iMac 4GB RAM was running Mavericks.  Due to memory limitation, I've gone back to Snow Leopard.  I'm trying to recover email folders that were "On My Mac" in Mavericks Mail app from TimeMachine.  I can get the .mbox files from the Library directory in the TimeMachine backup back into Snow Leopard Library, and Mail app in Snow Leopard shows the folders...but there are no messages showing in those folders.  I can open individual message files (.emlx files) from Finder, but is there some way to get Snow Leopard Mail app to read the Mavericks mail folders?
