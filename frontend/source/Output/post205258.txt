Mystery "Menu Extra" <body> Can anyone identify this menulet please? I can't drag it off the menu like others and I can't see it in any of the locations that a google search has suggested like /System/Library/PreferencePanes/. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPSxz.png" alt="enter image description here"  It doesn't appear for other users on this machine.  Thanks  <answer205263> Never seen that icon, but there are many questions on how to guess the icon on the site.  Here's how I would track it down where in your case, it's isolated to one specific user account.  ol liLog out all users/li liLog in as a new user (without the icon) and dump the process table to /tmp `/li liRepeat for the other user/li liCompare the two files to see what is different./li /ol  I use Kaleidoscope/ksdiff, buy you can diff the files using other tools if you prefer:  precodeps -u `id -u` | cut -c 32- | sort | uniq &gt; /tmp/user_ps_cleaned_`id -u` /code/pre  So, if your user ids were 501 and 502, you could:  precodediff /tmp/user_ps_cleaned_* /code/pre  <answer205278> h2opensnoop/h2  You can also use codeopensnoop/code to get more info on the icon. codeopensnoop/code is a Terminal app, it is pre-installed on your mac. When run with no options, codeopensnoop/code just prints all the files that are accesed on your computer in real-time  ol liopen Terminal./li litype codesudo opensnoop/code, your console will fillup fast./li liclick the icon./li lilook at the console to see which PID or which program get triggerd when clicking on the icon./li /ol  <comment247523> I also tried using Accessibility Inspector from Xcode, but it revealed nothing when cursor over mystery icon. <comment247533> This answer reminds me of an app that returns the PID of each GUI item the mouse hover over. Unfortunately, forgot the name... <comment247534> For me it looks like none of the os ones so it must be from an Application - On most of the Menu Extras from Applications you will get a Pane if you click on the sometimes you need to ctrl-click/right-click to get the Pane - Most of the time you will see a option to quit it and somewhere the name of the Application or at least a info/help option. <comment247537> @CousinCocaine That would be an awesome extension. I wonder if it calls some sort of responder chain to work backwards from anything that expects a click? <comment247544> the app is called `xprop`, but is only available on Linux. <comment247545> `opensnoop` does a quite similar job on OS X. <comment247943> Well that's odd - I was all set to try these great looking tools only to find that the bloody icon has now gone. Thanks for taking the time to help, and if I ever do discover what it was I'll post right back here! N.
