Can't delete .plist files from Trash <body> I have a program which, when deleting any app, also deletes the extra files and junk as well; including .plist files. Normally this works great though, this time around I've had a few files which won't allow me to empty the trash.  I get the following when I click on "Empty Trash":     The operation can’t be completed because the item   “com.justinmind.prototyperfree.plist” is in use.      The operation can’t be completed because the item   “com.marketcircle.Billings3.plist” is in use.      The operation can’t be completed because the item   “com.opendns.osx.DNSCrypt-Menubar.plist” is in use.      The operation can’t be completed because the item   “hewgill.com.Stack-Exchange-Notifier.plist” is in use.   I tried the following without success:  codelaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.justinmind.prototyperfree.plist/code and codelaunchctl unload /Users/myname/.Trash/com.justinmind.prototyperfree.plist/code  Not sure how to stop these things so I can empty the trash. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!  emOS X 10.9 (13A603)/em  <answer113502> I'm not sure if I will continue running into this issue or not and or if this was the "correct" way of doing it though, the following worked to delete the files:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/24122/33469  <answer113504> When you have problems to empty the trash, coderm -rf ~/.Trash/*/code in the terminal does the job for you.   Edit :  You have to keep in mind that there might be multiple code.Trash/code directories. br / For example on a USB stick or a external Drive, OSX will create another code.Trash/code at the root of the drive. So you might need to use  coderm -rf /Volumes/DriveName/.Trash.*/code   <comment133178> `rm -rf ~/.Trash/*` should do the work. <comment133183> Great, thanks Matthieu! This is a more direct way of deleting vs the solution I found in my answer. <comment133191> Thanks, please also consider my edit.
