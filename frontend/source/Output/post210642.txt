.pkg for installer hangs on verify <body> I'm trying to install the Mono MDK, and downloaded the .pkg for 4.2.1 (about 200 MB), when I double click on the package, it opens a "verifying xxxxxMDKxxxxx.pkg" window, which does nothing for over an hour while the Installer icon bounces on the dock. Is there a way to bypass the verification or force it to verify?  Or, alternatively is there a way to install the Mono MDK using the command line?  I'm running a early 2011 Macbook Pro on OSX 10.11  <answer214549> Not a verified answer but I can't comment: try to disable Rootless System Integrity as indicated here.  Source: OSXDaily says "Mac users may need to disable rootless SIP protection in OS X before being able to successfully install Java, but you can enable it again after it has been installed. If you get stuck on “verifying…” during the installation process of Java, it’s because of rootless."  <answer240201> Ran into this with some other software, but wanted to pass on a tip I picked up.  In finder, launch code/System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app/code. It will prompt you to locate a code.pkg/code file to install. Navigate to the code.dmg/code volume you've mounted, and select the codexxxxxMDKxxxxx.pkg/code file.  Installation should proceed normally from there.  <answer249293> This might help   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG11m8ykuH8&amp;feature=youtu.be  That video worked for me, at least.  <answer249331> precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app /code/pre  For installer:  ol liOpen the Finder/li liNavigate to Go menu/li liSelect the Go to Folder submenu./li liCopy the file path into it./li liPress kbdEnter/kbd/li liLocate the code.dmg/code or code.mpkg/code package./li liVoila you are done./li /ol  <comment295557> Worked for me on El Capitan, thanks! <comment300330> Why does this happen? <comment301325> Not Mono pkg specific - I've seen it twice now (same computer) with Virtualbox. Still no idea what's causing, suspect some bug w/ Gatekeeper. <comment303317> Works on El Capitan 10.11.5 <comment309172> Welcome to Ask Different.

Never seen such silly bugs in OS X on previous versions. After descovering a lot of issues in all versions of OS X after Yosemite - I tried to stay on it as long as possible, but unfortunately latest macbook doesn't support earlier versions - now have to heck with this Capitan degradation :(
