Set layout for pictures in Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac <body> I'm working in a huge text-box in Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac.  When I insert a figure I can't find settings for the layout in order to fit the figure in between the text of the textbox. Therefore if I add a new line/word/sentence in the text I have to replace all the figures and the content.  Is there a possibility to merge and fit the picture in the text?  <comment271247> At the moment I'm not at a system with PowerPoint on it so I have to ask when you say "When I insert a figure", what exactly is "a figure"? <comment271255> An image or picture from the tool: insert image from file.
