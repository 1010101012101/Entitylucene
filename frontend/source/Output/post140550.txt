Internet Sharing from Ethernet over Wifi results in self-assigned IP address <body> I have OS X Mavericks with a Thunderbolt Ethernet connected to the internet with IP code192.168.0.1/code (which is a subrouter of code192.168.1.1/code).  I set up internet sharing through the Sharing interface and I am able to connect to the network and see it from my iPhone 5. My iPhone 5 is assigned an IP address in code192.168.2.*/code, but it can't connect to the internet. On my Mac, the Wi-Fi interface shows a self assigned IP address.  I tried manually setting the WiFi to code192.168.2.12, 255.255.255.0, 192.168.2.1/code with DNS code192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1/code as per (Mavericks Internet Sharing over Ethernet stopped working), but I haven't had any success. Does anyone have any ideas?  <comment165639> Show us what your sys pref sharing screen look like. <comment165647> This? http://i.gyazo.com/8c87f79120532c7291615c808ced0d2d.png http://i.gyazo.com/525aecb4510df7f766c1823c2c58e99a.png
