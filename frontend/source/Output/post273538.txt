JavaScript for Automation grinding to a halt <body> This concerns JXA on a Mac Pro with Sierra 12.3 and iTunes 12.5.5  I have created a JavaScript that uses for..in... etc to iterate through about a dozen playlists, checks if folders need creating or modifying for each track etc. It works and does what I need, but the problem is it just gets slower as it runs.  I wrote some fancy logging to see what's going on and when the script first runs, it processes about 40 tracks per second. This decreases for each playlist it processes until it's down to about 4 tracks per second - and then it starts the biggest playlist of all :-(  So I'm wondering, WTF is going on here. It makes me think it's most likely some memory problem. A portion of memory used for AppleEvents is getting filled up? Just a guess, but would make sense. However is it a problem with iTunes, the JavaScript core engine, the JXA 'bridge' or the underlying AppleEvents system built-in to MacOS? Anyone here got any thoughts on this?
