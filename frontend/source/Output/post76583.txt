Why is the VPN switch sometimes missing from settings on my iPad? <body> There is a VPN switch in settings that often appears below the wifi option in settings on iOS:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NzpIl.png" alt="enter image description here" (the above image is from a website and not my iPad, as I can't seem to get my iPad to show VPN right now)  The trouble is, it seems to be missing: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/enMUt.png" alt="enter image description here" (this image is from my iPad)  strongVPN switch present:/strong  ul liin all circumstances prior to installing an AT&amp;T sim card, including when a Telus sim card was installed/li liwhile using wifi with an AT&amp;T sim card installed but in a region with no AT&amp;T coverage and no data roaming disable by AT&amp;T (ie.

Does the connection/sim card/network somehow determine whether VPN is available?  Is there something else altogether I need to check?/strong  <answer76588> h2Check for a VPN Profile/h2  Turns out the missing VPN switch had nothing to do with which connection was used.  What seems to have happened is that all the VPN profiles were deleted.  When that happens, the VPN switch seems to disappear.  To check for or create a new VPN profile, go to settings-general-network-VPN:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/saszo.png" alt="enter image description here"  Once you create a VPN profile, the VPN switch reappears in the root of the settings screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bqvx9.png" alt="enter image description here"
