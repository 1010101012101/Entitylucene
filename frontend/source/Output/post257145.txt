Apple ID compromised and illegal purchase <body> Lets say, someone managed to log into my Apple ID and then bought an iPhone from the Apple Store.  I did not notice the purchase because i got mailbombed (on the email account behind the Apple ID) that day and had to bulk delete my emails (common approach to hide activity, rather sophisticated though).  What i know:  ul liI see the purchase in the shop history, i see where it got shipped to (unknown to me address)/li liDate of purchase/li liItem: iPhone 6S/li liSerial number (is stated on the bill)/li liA second iPhone (other than the one i do really own and use) is listed under "my devices" with a count of days until the Apple ID can be changed (every 90 days i think). Only option there is "remove./li /ul  What i did already:  ul lifollow knowledge base/li lichange password of Apple ID/li lichange answers to security questions/li lienable 2-factor auth/li lienable 2-step verification/li licontact credit card company/li liopen issue with Apple/li licheck "Find my Phone". Its not activated/does not show up in device list/li licheck "Activation Lock"/li /ul  What other options do i have? Will contacting police authorities lead anywhere? Is there a way to access the phone remotely even though i never touched it?  <comment320966> Contacting the police won't really lead anywhere but you'll need a report number for insurance and maybe Apple.  I don't think you can access the iPhone but Apple will probably disable it via their methods. <comment321008> @fsb is correct. You should most definitely report it to police so you have a record of it, especially since you don't know what may come of this later. And yes, Apple have their way of dealing with the other iPhone. <comment321050> If the receipt has the IMEI it maybe worthwhile reporting it in the country of the origin of the thief. I do not remember clearly the details, but I could swear we have a nation wide IMEI blacklist here. Which just means they ship it normally to Mozambique, Angola or Brazil due to ties and affinity of language...
