iWork Numbers evaluate string <body> I have a cell with the following content code2262/4121/code. I want to have a cell next to it that contains the result of that expression. Is there a function for that?  <answer27100> You can use the VALUE() function for that. Its only argument is the cell that you want to evaluate.  <comment31004> On the spot. Thank you a bunch. <comment111386> It only works if the source text cell contains a mathematical expression in the form of "a/b". Any other operator such as +-* fails. Also multiple operands such as "a+b+c-d+e-f+g" are not possible.  I would like to have my source text cell with i.e. "1+2+3-4+5-6.7+8.99" and another cell evaluating the content of that source cell. <comment151251> Anyone with a solution for evaluating a cell with multiple arbitrary operands?
