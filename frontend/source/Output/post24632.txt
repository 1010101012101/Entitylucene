Is it safe to upgrade Bash via Homebrew? <body> I'm new to OS X. I'm running OS X Lion on a MacBook Pro. Is it safe to upgrade the bash shell using Homebrew:  precode$ brew install bash /code/pre  If safe, how do I make it the default instance of the shell I run through Terminal?  Thanks!  <answer24633> Well before you do anything, back up your current file (of course, but always deserves to be said)  precodesudo cp /bin/bash /bin/bash.3.2.bk /code/pre  Then create a symlink to the bash executable that Homebrew downloaded. I think it will be in /usr/local/Cellar, like so  precodesudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/bash/4.2.10/bin/bash /bin/bash /code/pre  Now /bin/bash points to the file in your usr/local directory  <answer24634> I could be wrong here, but as far as I know codebrew/code would install it's own instance of codebash/code, since brew works under code/usr/local/bin/code while the system defaults works under code/bin/code (and code/usr/bin/code).  About Terminal, you can make shells open with your own, custom command. Go to Preferences  Startup and select strongShells open with: Command (complete path)/strong. Simply type the path to your new codebash/code and vuala!  Hope it helps!  BTW: Backup! Best advice in this situations!  <answer24635> Binaries in code/{,usr/}{,s}bin//code should not usually be replaced with other files. Other programs expect them to be the versions that came with OS X, and they are replaced by OS upgrades.  After running codebrew install bash/code, you can change the default shell safely by:  ul liAdding code/usr/local/bin/bash/code to code/etc/shells/code/li liRunning codechsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash/code./li /ul  Settings in Terminal or iTerm 2 don't normally have to be changed. Both of them default to opening new windows with a login shell of the default shell.  The default shell can also be changed from System Preferences or with dscl, but all three options just modify code/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/$USER.plist/code.  <answer230071> I think it is safe if you just launch  precodebrew install bash /code/pre  and then add it as your default shell  precodechsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  since you are only modifying your current user. However, I noticed that my default em~/.profile/em is  precodeif [ "/bin/bash" == $BASH ]; then     source ~/.bashrc fi /code/pre  so it needs to be updated. I changed it to  precodeif [ "bash" == $(basename $BASH) ]; then         source ~/.bashrc fi /code/pre  <comment27652> Looks like it worked, and if I experience any issues it should be easy to roll back! Thanks! <comment27656> The downside of plopping a new bash in for the system version is any update of the OS can erase your preferred shell. Presumably the OP wants to use new features which could break if the OS installs a "newer than old OS" but "older than custom" version of bash. Better to change the default path or change the user shell variable. <comment27665> well, you could just create a new simlink since it wouldn't overwrite the version of bash in your usr/local directory. but you are correct, Daniel's way is prob better <comment27666> Ooh - edit your answer please to put that first (and keep the original idea if you prefer as a second alternative - I like that much better and would love a chance to reverse my vote :-) <comment27667> hmm, well that /is/ what I said, but I edited to try to clarify what each step does a little better. Still think top rated answer is prob better though :) <comment27669> did not know that advanced option page was there. Sweet! <comment27672> This seems like a pretty dangerous way to go about changing the system shell. <comment27718> why? it can be reversed at any time. <comment46543> The bit about editing `/etc/shells` to include the brew-installed bash is required. Otherwise (at least on my machine) Terminal will refuse to start. <comment147665> The third command (csh -s) appears to no longer be necessary on Mavericks 10.9.2. <comment173129> hey, you know what, this answer actually works like a charm <comment173137> I just had to `brew install bash` for this to work. (i.e. didn't have to modify `/etc/shells`) <comment173265> This question has suddenly become extremely relevant, [see Shellshock](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=au&tbm=nws&authuser=0&q=shellshock&oq=shellshock) <comment173435> If you do this, you should really point to the version-independent /usr/local/opt/bash/bin/bash instead of the versioned Cellar path. <comment280767> See other answers for why `chsh` alone is not enough. Also it your updated .profile snippet looks identical to the original one <comment280773> Yes. 10 c h a r s <comment280935> @patrix: thanks to point it out, I updated the second snippet. It would be nice if `brew install bash` would not require any further action. With the updated profile I shared, it does not. I hope this can help others.
