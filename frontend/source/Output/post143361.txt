List extensions that are opened with a specific application <body> Is there an easy way to find all the extensions that are opened with a given application?br I'm asking because I have two versions of a software installed (Sublime 2 and 3), and some extensions still open with Sublime 2 because by the time I specified that Sublime 3 was not available. I then have to quit Sublime, change the program that shall be opened by default for this extension and relaunch.  I would like to end this once and for all and change it for every remaining extension. Does anyone know of an easy way to do this? Thank you!  <answer143364> If you want all files with a certain extension (not the 1 specific file) to be opened by a certain app, do the following:  ol liRight click the file and click codeGet Info/code (or highlight file and hit kbdcmd ⌘/kbd + kbdi/kbd )/li liChange codeOpen with:/code to preferred app/li liClick codeChange All.../code/li liClick codeContinue/code in the confirmation box/li /ol  Is this what you meant to do? This is different from right clicking a file and choosing the 'Always open with' option. That seems to only apply to the specific file, not all files globally.  You will have to repeat this for each extension.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e17ji.png" alt="Get info screen" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y1SIp.png" alt="Confirmation box"  <answer143385> Open the file code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.‌​plist/code in Xcode. The file contains all the bindings for extensions to applications.  Find/replacing the values did not work for me, since the file was overwritten every time. But you can use Find to get a list of all the extensions that are opened with a particular application and then change it by hand.  <comment168816> In terminal, execute `defaults read com.apple.LaunchServices.plist  ~/Desktop/defaults.txt`. Open up the text file and find the keys matching each sublime property list. Once identified, you can set those opening with 2 to open with 3. See [here](http://superuser.com/questions/273756/how-to-change-default-app-for-all-files-of-particular-file-type-through-terminal) <comment168833> Thanks for your answer, but I do know of this way. The problem is that I do not know which extensions are bound to Sublime 2. <comment168836> Couldn't you simply 'override' all extensions you want opened with Sublime 3 using this method, once? <comment168837> @nijbot: Thanks for the tip, it brought me on the right track. When I execute your command, it returns an error "Domain com.apple.LaunchServices.plist does not exist". However, there is an additional file `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist`, that I opened with Xcode. You can change the default programs there. <comment168838> Sure, but I run the risk that I forget one and end up being annoyed later when I find one I forgot. <comment168954> you're welcome. there's not a simple way at all (AFAIK, or at least from what I looked into) to return the desired information using commands like `grep` `sed` or `awk` since you're matching multiple strings over multiple lines. The easiest way, as you note, is in Xcode. Also, not sure why `secure` is prepended to the extension, perhaps this is the behavior if you use filevault and your drive is encrypted (I don't), but that's the same file for sure. BOL. Cheers. <comment168955> Also, why do you have both versions installed? Uninstalling Sublime 2 and then manually removing it's `.plist` would solve the immediate issue. <comment168964> In my original comment, follow the instructions in the link. You need to change these values using the terminal. <comment168965> The problem is that the domain can not be found, thus I did not get it to work via Terminal. <comment168968> edit the domain to `com.apple.launchservices.secure.‌​plist` <comment168969> @njboot yes, I already tried that, same result. The weird thing about all this is that `default domains` actually does return `com.apple.LaunchServices`, even though the manpage specifically states that it only considers domains in the space of the user. <comment168975> you may need `sudo` to edit the `plist` in that case, even though it's in your user library. Are you running filevault? Also, what happens if you `touch ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.launchservices.plist; mv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist ~/Desktop/`. Log out then in. does secure regenerate in your library? are you able to `defaults write` to the one you created? <comment168976> [See this discussion](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/50004/why-is-a-command-line-change-to-library-preferences-com-apple-launchservices-p) <comment169006> First of all, yes, I'm running FileVault. Second, `sudo` is not helping for the `secure` domain. I moved the `secure` file to the Desktop (it is, however, stored in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist`), and as you assumed, it gets regenerated. I can write with `defaults write com.apple.launchservices.plist test 1` and then `defaults read` it afterwards, too.
