How to sent the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination via iTerm2? <body> We use the Apple "Pro Keyboard", which is a USB keyboard with model number M7803, and iTerm2 build 1.0.0 with "ipmitool sol activate" running.  Our goal is to sent the kbdControl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd key combination to the remote host.  We tried this by: iTerm  Preferences  Keys  [+]:  ul liKeyboard Shortcut: ⌃⌥Del→ /li liAction: [ Send Hex Code ]/li liHex code: 1d 38 53 b8 9d/li /ul  This configuration does not sent the kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdDel/kbd key combination to the remote host, Debian 6.0.6 running kernel 2.6.32-5-amd64 #1 SMP, at least the machine does not reboot as it would do when pressing kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdDel/kbd on a local attached keyboard.  How to issue a reboot command on the remote machine using kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdDel/kbd key combination via iTerm?  <comment93824> Usually you can do this just on the local console and not remotely. Which system do you have on the other side? <comment93825> Debian 6.0.6 running kernel 2.6.32-5-amd64 #1 SMP <comment93826> Any reason why you are not just typing "reboot"? In any case take a look at http://serverfault.com/questions/50277/send-ctrl-alt-del-over-ssh <comment93845> @Matteo We don't type reboot because there is no prompt in the GRUB2 version 1.99 menu. <comment93867> Do you mean that you want to connect to the host before the system is loaded and the Grub menu is present? How do you connect to the remote host? <comment93905> @Matteo: We connect via Serial Over LAN as described in the question with the partial command "ipmitool sol activate". <comment93912> OK I missed that ...
