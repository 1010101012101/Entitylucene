OS X Mountain Lion shortcut menu <body> I just switched from a PC (Ubuntu 12.10) to a Macbook Pro (Mountain Lion). I'd like to know if there's a way to have a similar shortcut menu on the dock as I had on Ubuntu's sidebar? Basically I made a clickable menu to run a bunch of expect scripts so I wouldn't have to do it through the terminal. Here's how it looks in ubuntu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uKf3X.jpg" alt="ubuntu desktop script"  I used a .desktop config file to add each menu item and then dragged it onto the sidebar. So my question is - what are the ways to have something like this in OS X?  <answer86270> You could have a look at one of  ul liAlfred      Alfred saves you time when you search for files online or on your Mac. Be more productive with hotkeys, keywords and file actions at your fingertips. /li liKeyboard Maestro     Keyboard Maestro 5 is now available with control flow, variables, calculations, file actions, image manipulation, macro library and more.       Keyboard Maestro is a powerful macro program for Mac OS X Mountain Lion, Lion and Snow Leopard which has received glowing reviews.  /li /ul  Especially Alfred works like a command line for O X and gives you the option to control most of your system interaction with simple text commands. If you prefer menus and mouse clicks, Keyboard Maestro might be the better choice.  <answer86274> FastScripts is a menu bar application for running scripts:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUoBB.jpg" alt=""  Automator services aren't really usable in 10.8 or 10.7, but see this question for other ways to assign shortcuts to scripts.
