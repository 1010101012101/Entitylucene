Why does only half my monitor light up sometimes <body> Sometimes when I wake my MacBook Pro (late 2013) from sleep I only get the right half of the screen lighting up while the left is dark with a hard line dividing the halves (see image below). I can fix this by power-cycling the monitor but its annoying. Can anyone tell me what is happening and how I might fix it? My monitor is a 32 inch Samsung and I have a dual HDMI cable connecting it to my MacBook.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBvY0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer267865> There are three possible causes in a situation like this:  ol liAn issue with the MacBook Pro/li liAn issue with the monitor/li liA faulty cable/li /ol  Trying to identify the problem involves a process of elimination and some patience.  strong1.

There may be other things to try (e.g. changing screen resolution, changing mode, etc) but I'd reset the SMC and NVRAM first and try using the monitor as usual to see if that resolves the issue.  strong2. Monitor/strong  You don't specify your exact model of Samsung monitor, but regardless of model you will be able to reset the monitor. The instructions for doing so will be in your manual.   Most recent Samsung monitors can be reset by holding down the Source button for about 20 seconds, while older models will have specific instructions. If you don't have your manual, accessing the monitor's Menu and browsing the options should provide a reset option. In some cases you may need to do multiple resets (e.g. Geometry reset, Colour reset, etc).  You can also try changing some of the monitor's other settings to determine what difference this makes.  strong3. Cable/strong  Testing for a faulty cable is straightforward as it simply involves trying another cable. However, unless you happen to have access to a spare cable, I would try the above steps for your MacBook Pro and monitor first.  <comment336171> Could it be an issue with the monitor, as this only happens when the monitor is plugged in and becomes fixed when you power cycle it?
