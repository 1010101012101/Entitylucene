iPod touch 4th Gen stopped working with iHome iP90 <body> I have an iPod touch 4th generation that I had been using with my iHome iP90 until today.  All of a sudden today I get a message saying that "This accessory is not supported"  Then when I remove my touch the sound no longer works.  When I reboot my sound returns.  Any ideas?  Really confused because all was fine until today.  <answer10815> I stuck it in another older IP90 and it worked fine. So then I blew it and the IP90 out with compressed air and now it works. I'm not convinced it was the air though, we will see if it returns. Thanks.  <comment11302> Did you recently upgrade the firmware on your touch, say to 4.3? <comment11303> I updated a few weeks ago but it was working fine after that <comment11304> That's odd. Is the connector at the bottom bent? Does wiggling it while docked help? <comment11305> I stuck it in another older IP90 and it worked fine.
