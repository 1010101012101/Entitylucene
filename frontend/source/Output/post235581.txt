Safari: Anyway to initiate pinch-to-zoom without trackpad? <body> Command + (Zoom in) and Command - (Zoom out) are different from pinch-to-zoom on a trackpad. The former changes the layout of the page, whereas the latter just enlarges the page as if a magnifier was used.  Is there any way to initiate pinch-to-zoom without a trackpad? Any methods such as a keyboard shortcut or an API.  <answer235582> My mouse has a scroll wheel as its middle button. For zoom out or in I can use command with scroll up or down.    I don't remember if that was the default behavior, or I selected it at some past time.  strongadded/strongbr I guess this is set at: System Preferences  Accessibility  Zoom  <answer235596> Hold down CTRL and Scroll on your mouse !!   <comment288159> If you looking for an API, Apple has the trackpad API here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/HandlingTouchEvents/HandlingTouchEvents.html <comment288235> No, it just scrolls the page. Added: after reading the comment of 'GEdgar'', I found this answer to be the same as his. <comment288236> This seems to enlarge the entire screen as a bitmap. The difference is that pinch-to-zoom enlarges the web page's text as vectors. So the former makes the text blurry, but the latter does not. <comment288237> I am not familiar with OS X programming, but on Windows, you can simulate mouse movements by sending the events to the application using `SendMessage()` or `PostMessage()`. Is such thing possible with OS X? I want to send the some kind of  'pinch-to-zoom occurred' event to Safari.
