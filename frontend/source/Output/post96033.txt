Each time you emrestore/em an iOS device's OS, Apple strongmust/strong sign as valid the version you are trying to install, and once a version has been considered as emdeprecated/em, which usually is a couple of weeks after a new iOS version has been released, Apple stops providing a emvalid certification/em for it.
