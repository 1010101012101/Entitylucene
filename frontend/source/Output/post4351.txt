How can I type Chinese on MacBook Pro? <body> I would like to know how to type Chinese (simplified), using Pinyin, on my MacBook Pro.   I went to System Preference  Language &amp; Text  Language, moved Chinese (simplified) on the list right after English, and then under the Input Sources tab, I check Chinese simplified and English.   After all these steps, I still have no clue how to type Chinese. (When I open TextEdit, I don't see any language selection.)  <answer4352> After select pinyin in your input language you can open any editor like textEdit:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IahcJ.jpg" alt="alt text"  when you start typing you see the box (like below box) and can select your desire word.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/60POS.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer38906> For this and other useful info, there's a whole site:  http://www.yale.edu/chinesemac
