New phone making me start a new game <body> Got me a new phone New iPhone  6+ is  Making me start a new game but I already have a game I'm level 83 how can I get my game back   <answer150461> Even some games are linked to facebook .. So all you have to do is sign into face book abd link the game to it ..   <comment177057> It would help to know which gameâ€”some games store data in Game Center (where you can just sign in), but others store it on your phone (where you'd have to restore from backup).
