Is there a way to see a list of all the apps available on the app store? <body> I know that there are several ways to browse the App Store. You can see the featured apps, which I assume are featured by Apple staff. There's genius, which is based on your prir purchases. Then there are the Top Charts, which I guess are based on consumer choices. Categories allows you to see apps by category.   All of these are insanely great, but is there a way to just see an alphabetized list of all 500,000+ apps? Perhaps on iTunes on Mac OS X?  (Incidentally, it would take a hundred thousand iPhones to see all the apps at once.)  <answer44363> I'm not at my computer, so I can't test it in iTunes at the moment, but here's how to do it on iOS.  ol liGo to the Featured section of the App Store./li liSelect the Release Date tab at the top./li liChange sort method to Name./li /ol  <answer44385> As far as I am aware Apple itself limits this to category. I think they have specifically not included this option to make browsing the AppStore a simpler process for not technical people, which is the bulk of their target market. Therefore even iTunes doesn't have an option to do this yet.  I use an App called AppShopper which allows you to search for specials, and also specify which categories you want to see. I haven't used it in a while but if I recall it does have an option to list all applications in all categories.  <comment50409> I believe this is an iPad only feature, since I don't see a "Release Date" tab on my iPhone. <comment50411> Oh, sorry. I'll try to find a way to do it in iTunes tomorrow. <comment51833> HAve you had a chance to look? <comment51988> @Moshe Not extensively, but yes, and I haven't found anything so far. Will let you know if I discover anything.
