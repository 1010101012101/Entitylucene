Move folder to finder favorite bar not possible - bug in OSX <body> Just in case someone runs into the same problem and is banging his had on the wall as there seems no solution ... OS X 10.11.3 still contains a bug where it sometimes is not possible to add a folder to the favorite side bar root. It always tries to add to another folder, but does not let you drop the folder directly to the root element.  The solution is to right click the folder, services, reveal in finder. Go back to the original window and ... you can add the folder/alias to the side bar root.   <comment274257> Please can you let Apple know directly. The best way is by [logging a formal bug](http://bugreporter.apple.com) and by providing [feedback to the OS X team](http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html). <comment274258> Done. Bug ID: 24455740
