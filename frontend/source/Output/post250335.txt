HiDPI Mode not respected by iOS Simulator <body> I turned on HiDPI mode in my OS X El Capitan and now facing the issue: iOS Simulator screen shows only part of its contents. Please see the picture below.  If I turn HiDPI mode off then everything gets back to normal.  What can I do to have both HiDPI mode on and proper iOS Simulator screen?  I am using Xcode 7.3.1 and iOS 9.3 simulator.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQCC1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer252809> The issue is gone after installing Xcode 8.  <comment310805> This seems more like a bug that should be reported to Apple.
