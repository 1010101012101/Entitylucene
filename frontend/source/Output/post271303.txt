itunes is stuck backing up my iphone 5c, maybe stuck in sync <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nIRp9.png" alt="enter image description here"  The progress bar shows full the whole time.  When I try to quit itunes it says "iphone is still syncing so maybe there is a problem with the sync?  It doesn't tell me how much time is left or anything.  I've tried rebooting both devices as well as tried backing up to iCloud.  I have the latest version of iTunes as well.  <comment341044> What version of iOS is it running <comment341045> I think 10.1.  It asks to update and when I try to it tries to back up which gets stuck.  I cant do it through my phone either because I dropped it and now the screen is permanently black
