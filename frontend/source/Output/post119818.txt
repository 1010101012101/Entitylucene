Why are my Terminal.app colors different from iTerm? <body> I have set the ANSI colors of both terminals to be the same (see 1st screenshot), but the colors for Terminal.app are really bright, and almost unreadable, and not like the colors I set at all.  It's not just the prompt as well. Even with Vim the colors are different.   EDIT: It's like in Terminal.app, something is overriding colors.

As for Terminal it relies on the Bash profile configuration file. It is usually found in /User/USERNAME/.bash_config.  Here is an example of mine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L6GiT.png" alt="enter image description here"  For a bash ls colors generator as seen on line three in this image visit here: http://geoff.greer.fm/lscolors/  <answer263378> There has been some discussion on the web about iTerm2's color accuracy being off,  ul lihttps://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues/257/li lihttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7278267/incorrect-colors-with-vim-in-iterm2-using-solarized/li /ul  Including a bug report on iTerm2 issue tracker, https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/3989.  Sounds like it might just be a iTerm2 issue.  <comment139763> It's a completely different program? Do not expect every application to use all color-schemes exact the same way. <comment139777> Umm, why would I not assume that? <comment139786> I don't have a .bash_config, and both screenshots use the same .bash_profile. I tried copying your LSCOLORS expecting it to at least change the `ls` colors, but they're the same. <comment139796> In OS X, `.bash_profile` is used in lieu of the traditional Linux `.bash_config` and by default, it does not exit, the user has to create it.
