MacBook pro boot Kernel panic no kext summary <body> Yesterday my Mac crashed and after trying to turn it on again I recieved a message like this:     panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff800667b0b2): "VM page 0xffffff800ad5fad0 should not have an error\n"@SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2422.1.72/osfmk/vm/vm_kern.c:457   Debugger called:   Backtrace(CPU 0), Frame : Return Address   ...   ...   ...   Can't perform kext scan: no kext sumaryczny   BSD proces name corresponding to current thread: unknown      Mac version:   Not yet set      Kernel version:   Darvin Kernel Version 13.0.0: thu sept 19 22:22:27 pdt 2013; root:xnu-2422.1.72~6/release_x86_64   Kernel UUID: ...

I can't access Recovery HD. When I try to do it by hitting kbdCmd/kbd-kbdR/kbd or kbdAlt/kbd while booting, Mac freezes and does nothing except generating a lot of heat around CPU. I can only turn it on, do nothing and wait for the kernel message above.  What can I do?  <answer110199> I'd advise you to boot your Mac from the system DVD and check the internal disk. The coincidence of codekext scan/code failing and the coderecovery HD/code unreachable let me diagnose a major disk (and not just filesystem) trouble. The CPU overheating emmight/em be a consequence of a fool's codefsck/code.  If you don't have a system DVD to boot your Mac (which is the case since Lion), I advise you to ask a colleague who have the exact same MacOS X version to build you one.  <comment129862> Do you think that formatting hard drive and installing OSX from scratch can solve those problems? I'll try that. I've installed a new SSD drive maybe 2-3 months ago. I fear it can cause those problems. But it started after i installed OSX Maverics. It worked well with OSX Lion <comment129873> I would first analyze the disk from another one. If you have Mavericks on a DVD or on an external HDD, start with this. BTW, when booted from an external disk, you might also check for any errors collected before the crash within `/var/log/system.log`. These error messages may help you target the real problem: hardware or software. <comment272986> General advice on troubleshooting kernel panics is here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/199737/what-is-a-kernel-panic-and-what-does-it-mean
