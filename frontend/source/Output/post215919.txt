Enable Multicast on Mac? <body> Following enabling-multicast-on-your-macos-unix, I am trying to enable multicast on my machine. Firstly, I checked if my network interface supports multicast by running below command:  precodeifconfig -a /code/pre  Output I got is:  precodeen0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=10b&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,AV&gt;     ether 68:5b:35:d5:26:76      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect (none)     status: inactive /code/pre  Then, I added the codemulticast/code address, using command:  precodesudo route -nv add -net 228.0.0.4 -interface en0 /code/pre  Then, I checked if multicast IP is visible in my route table, using command:  precodenetstat -nr /code/pre  And yes, there is an entry in my codeRouting table/code:  precode228.0.0.4/32       68:5b:35:d5:26:76  UmS             0       10     en0 /code/pre  Then I run the below command on my mac:  precodeping -t 1 -c 2 228.0.0.4 /code/pre  Gives me below result:  precodePING 228.0.0.4 (228.0.0.4): 56 data bytes ping: sendto: Network is unreachable ping: sendto: Network is unreachable Request timeout for icmp_seq 0  --- 228.0.0.4 ping statistics --- 2 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss /code/pre  Then, dropping the IP from Routes Table as follows:  precode sudo route -v delete -inet 228.0.0.4 /code/pre  and added an entry with interface to strongen1/strong:  precodeen1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether a8:bb:cf:20:fb:1a      inet6 fe80::aabb:cfff:fe20:fb1a%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x6      inet 192.168.2.124 netmask 0xfffffc00 broadcast 192.168.3.255     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect     status: active /code/pre  then there is an entry in my codeRouting table/code as below:  precode  228.0.0.4/32       1:0:5e:0:0:4       UmLS            0        0     en1 /code/pre  Running codesudo tcpdump -ni en1 host 228.0.0.4/code gives me:  precode tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode  listening on en1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes  15:51:21.962437 IP 192.168.2.124 &gt; 228.0.0.4: ICMP echo request, id 21017, seq 0, length 64  15:51:22.966098 IP 192.168.2.124 &gt; 228.0.0.4: ICMP echo request, id 21017, seq 1, length 64 /code/pre  And running codeping -t 1 -c 2 228.0.0.4/code command, gives me below result:  precodePING 228.0.0.4 (228.0.0.4): 56 data bytes  --- 228.0.0.4 ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss /code/pre  Can anyone help me in enabling the codeMulticast/code.  Thanks!  <answer215925> No IP-address is visible/configured and the status of your en0 is eminactive/em.  Adding a route to en0 is obviously possible though. It's still impossible to ping an inactive interface/unreachable network.  Configure an IP-address for en0 and attach it to a network and you should be done. If you have a second Mac configure the same multicast address and check the outgoing pings from the first Mac with codesudo tcpdump -ni en0 host 228.0.0.4/code.  <comment261038> I tried with active interface and still not able to ping. I also updated the question with steps I followed. <comment261053> @Arpit The result of your ping should be correct now and multicast is enabled. Just check it with tcpdump! <comment261061> `tcpdump` gives me result as posted in updated questions, why I am not able to ping the address `228.0.0.4`? <comment261068> @Arpit That's exactly how multicast works! I'll extend my answer as soon as I'm at home again. <comment261367> I am having multiple tomcat servers(running on different ports) on the same machine, and when I am starting any of them, I am getting error - `org.apache.catalina.tribes.membership.McastServiceImpl start SEVERE: Unable to join multicast group, make sure your system has multicasting enabled. org.apache.catalina.ha.tcp.SimpleTcpCluster startInternal SEVERE: Unable to start cluster. org.apache.catalina.tribes.ChannelException: java.net.SocketException: Can't assign requested address; No faulty members identified.` <comment261384> @Arpit Would you mind asking a **new** question about the Tomcat servers. With some background information... <comment261386> sure, will ask a seperate question, just one thing to confirm one thing, any idea why I am not able to ping multicast address? <comment261387> @Arpit I'm still investigating this. Until now I think there is just nothing (e.g. no service running) at "multicast host" 228.0.0.4 which could reply. You can try to ping 224.0.0.251 (that should work) which is tied to Apple Bonjour (running on almost every Mac host). <comment286034> make sure you plug in the network cable so that en0 gets active
