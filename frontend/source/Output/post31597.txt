Why can't I paste a password into a password form on a webpage? <body> On my Snow Leopard Mac, I can't seem to paste into a password field on login pages to Apple sites, (developer.apple.com for example). I thought is was a browser issue but it's happening with Safari, Chrome and Firefox so it must be the System.  I assume this is somebody's idea of a security feature, though I fail to see the logic and it's very annoying.  Any ideas on how to fix, turn off or work-around this?  <answer31601> Right-click on the password field and under the menu that appears, select "paste" (it happens to me in Firefox and that is my fix).  <answer37689> Use the Web Inspector in WebKit based browsers and remove the codeonpaste="return false;"/code attribute and you'll be able to paste your password.  <answer53781> This is exactly why I have a keyboard for Safari to disable JavaScript and that feature is one reason why I prefer Safari.  It is also handy on sites which try to block the 'copy' command or otherwise abuse JavaScript.  I can enable/disable JavaScript just by pressing ⌘ + J   h3The GUI way/h3  ul liLaunch Safari/li liGo to Preferences/li liGo to 'Advanced' preferences/li liClick 'Show develop menu in menu bar./li lilaunch System Preferences/li ligo to Keyboard preferences /li liselect 'Keyboard Shortcuts'/li lichoose 'Application Shortcuts'/li liclick the + button/li liset Application to 'Safari'/li liset the Menu Title to 'Disable JavaScript' (note that Capitalization emis/em important, it must be exactly the way it is shown in Safari)/li liset the keyboard shortcut to something like ⌘ + J/li /ul  h3The Command Line Way/h3  If 12 steps seems like a lot of hassle, try these two (Note: Safari must emnot/em be running when you make these change)  codedefaults write com.apple.safari IncludeDevelopMenu 1/code  (That is the equivalent of the first 4 GUI actions.)  codedefaults write com.apple.safari NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Disable JavaScript" '@J'/code  (This is the equivalent of the last 8 GUI actions.)

I eventually determined that disabling JavaScript (JS) allowed me to paste into the password field.  There are now simple apps for your browser that allow you to quickly and easily toggle JS.  ul liChrome has an app called 'Quick Javascript Switcher'./li liFirefox has QuickJava./li liI found this for Safari but I haven't tested it/li /ul  <answer155203> I just had this problem with Firefox 33 on Costco's site. I disabled javascript with NoScript and was able to paste (cmd-v) my password and log in. BUT when on the page for a product whose price I wanted to see, it acted like I was not logged in even though I enabled all javascript. When I clicked 'Sign in to Buy Now', it just took me to my account page.  On to Safari 6.2. I was able, no problem, to right-click--Paste into the password field (cmd-v did not work). This time I could see the price and the tell-tale 'Sign Out', indicating that I was signed in. Simple solution.  <comment36237> It's not the system, its the field. Apple added JavaScript which disables pasting into it. (jackJoe's answer probably indicates a bug in Firefox, since that shouldn't work.) <comment36245> Ah, that makes more sense. I always forget about that pesky js. <comment36253> @ughoavgfhw actually it used to work, probably on a different version of Firefox or a different javascript than before, because I just tried it with FF 4 and no luck... It does work in other cases, I suppose Apple's javascript in these pages is more clever now.
