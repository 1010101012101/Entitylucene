Spotlight Euro Exchange rate seems stuck to 2 weeks ago <body> I use Spotlight to currency conversions several times a day.  E.g. I type into Spotlight  100 EUR to GBP or 500 USD to CZK   However I have just noticed that the exchange rate is stuck to that of 2-3 weeks ago  For example, spotlight returns:   1 GBP = 1.34 EUR --- should be --- 1 GBP = 1.39 EUR  1 USD = 0.66 GBP --- this is correct  1 EUR = 136.45 YEN --- should be --- 1 EUR = 132.19 YEN  The strange thing is that Spotlight's data source is Yahoo, but checking directly the exchange rate with Yahoo the correct rate is returned. So it seems like there's an issue with Spotlight.  Can anyone try it from their end? And if it's only an issue that affects me, any ideas of what to do to get it fixed?  <answer213480> Rebooting the machine sorted out the issue, but not sure if it's only at bootup that OS X refreshes the exchange rates. So the problem might happen again if I don't reboot the machine for a long time
