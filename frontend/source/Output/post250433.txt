Random alarm clock <body> Are there apps or tools or ways, on a Macbook Pro, to have an alarm clock going off at random times? Apparently there is an iOS app, but nothing for Mac OsX. Any alternatives?  <comment310969> What do you mean by "random times?" I use [Clock Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clock-pro/id1107473342?mt=12) for alarms. <comment310972> Which I do not choose and that change every day randomly. <comment311044> @usumdelphini Give us an idea of why you'd want that. <comment311076> Because I want to remember to do a certain thing as many times as possible, while working on my computer (say, assume the right position on the chair)
