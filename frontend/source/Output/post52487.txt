Internet Sharing on Mac via LAN <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Internet Sharing is grey out       My Mac is connected to internet using WiFi and its working fine. I want to share the internet connection via LAN but I am unable to select the port (Ethernet) to be used for sharing in the internet sharing menu. Please see the screenshot attached.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OrK4h.png" alt="Internet Sharing Mac Problem"  Any solution to this problem?  <comment65346> What type of computer are you using? <comment84136> How is your WiFi connection configured? Have you tried removing the Ethernet interface from the list of network devices and readding it? <comment84195> I was having this problem when i was using MacBook Pro in my office. I am no longer using it. So cannot do further experiments with it.  @MacLemon: I almost never used Ethernet Interface (i am assuming that by removing/readding the interface you mean plugging/unplugging the ethernet wire). <comment84230> No, I actually meant removing the interface from the System Preferences  Network  Interfaces list on the left. Had I meant to unplug/replug the cable I would have said so.
