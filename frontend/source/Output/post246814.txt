Download Apps on loaned iPhone <body> Can I download some apps if Apple loans me an iPhone?     Apple is repairing my iPhone so they loaned me a device to use while mine is being repaired.   <answer246820> Login with your AppleID in codeSettings &gt; iTunes and App Stores/code and then run the App Store. Look in the codeUpdates &gt; Purchased/code tab for all the apps you can download.   In-app purchases can sometimes be re-enabled, but not all app developers handle this. Your milage may vary.  Make sure you go to codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Reset/code and Erase all Content and Settings before you turn in the loaner.
