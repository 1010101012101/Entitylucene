localhost MAMP OS X 10.8.4 upgrade tips <body> Follow the instructions exactly at http://documentation.mamp.info/en/mamp/installation/updating-mamp... 'COPY' and do not drag folders across to htdocs or from one folder to another. I dragged a folder out of htdocs and found it had been wiped.  I found this guy thinking it had something to do with MAMP...http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/install-and-configure-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-osx-108-mountain-lion and thought it was the answer... it is an answer but MAMP and MAMP PRO is separate completely and is the 'easy' way for a server on your machine.  I discovered Apache is on the system already and that is what the above tutorial refers to and has nothing whatsoever to do with the MAMP set-up.  I bought MAMP PRO but struggled with: 1. turning off the built in Apache - discovered I don't need to...see below comment! 2. getting my databases to show up in PHPMyAdmin even though they are in htdocs in the folder db.   It seems there are TWO PHPMyAdmins - one in the free MAMP and one in MAMP PRO - I have discovered that they do not 'merge' with each other in any way as I expected.  So I exported the tables from free MAMP as 'custom' which then allowed them to be saved as .sql files. Then in MAMP PRO created a database with nothing in it and imported the .sql file - it worked!  <comment113183> When you get the error 'Safari can’t connect to the server “localhost”', what is the ***exact*** URL you are trying to connect to? Do you restart Apache using `sudo` like this: `sudo httpd -k start`? You need to if Apache binds to a port below 1024. Could you restart Apache and post the output of this command: `tail -n 30 /var/log/apache2/error_log`? <comment117896> My apologies jaume for not replying - only saw your reply today as I did not set up the email notification correctly. I may have to start a new post because I have MAMP PRO but the databases are not showing... tried to turn off the system Apache with sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist but get launchctl: Error unloading: org.apache.httpd. <comment117897> If I post output code as you suggest, I would have to put it in the main post I take it? Thanks <comment117958> According to the documentation MAMP "the web server starts by default on port 8888. This port must be specified when calling the local web page in the browser, e.g.: `http://localhost:8888`". Is this the URL you are connecting to? I don't think you need to stop the built-in Apache: "MAMP will not compromise any existing Apache installation already running with your OS X. "  I'd suggest that you install MAMP PRO from scratch following the documentation to the letter. Should you run into any problems, rewrite this post accordingly and explain clearly what help you need. <comment118146> This is all very interesting. From your advice I stopped messing with the built in Apache which was a relief! I opened MAMP.app and not the MAMP PRO.app and discovered the databases in PHPMyAdmin! I was under the impression MAMP PRO would automatically 'merge' or 'communicate-with' the free MAMP - which is not the case!...unless I am missing something. They have separate PHPMyAdmins - which means you have to Export the database and then re-import to MAMP-PRO. It must also be exported as 'custom' if its to be automatically saved as a sql file. <comment118153> Woah - if you've solved your dilemma - we would love it if you pasted what is currently the question into the answer section and then edited down both so that the question is a simple statement of what's broken and the answer has the solution and thinking needed to get to the solution. <comment118194> OK bmike...I am no expert and what I have said above I figured out although there may be a better way. I was waiting to be corrected by greater minds than mine like your good self! If what I have said is correct and I am not enlightened further by some kind soul, then I'll make the post make more sense and it'll have some validity with it.
