Keyboard shortcut to delete row in Numbers <body> I can add rows conveniently using kbdOption/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdUp Arrow/kbd (insert above) or kbdOption/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdDown Arrow/kbd(insert below).  Is there a keyboard shortcut to strongdelete the current row/strong?  <answer114088> h3By default, no, there's no shortcut./h3  You can create one yourself though:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongShortcuts/strong → strongApp Shortcuts/strong./li liClick the strong+/strong button to add a new shortcut./li liSet the strongApplication/strong to strongNumbers.app/strong, and the strongMenu Title/strong to strongDelete Row/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eoetv.png" width="400"/li liSet your keyboard shortcut and press strongAdd/strong./li /ol  <comment133777> Thank you! I set it to Cmd+Shift+D. It doesn't seem to conflict with anything at the moment. <comment197673> This doesn't seem to work in Numbers 3.5.2 under Yosemite
