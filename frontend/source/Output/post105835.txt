Tool to Consolidate Data on Multiple Hard Drives and List Differences Between Filesets <body> I have several hard drives I've used throughout the years to backup my data. Each one has a different folder structure and fileset. I now have a massive NAS that I want to consolidate all my data onto. I've created a new folder structure on the NAS and have moved over most of my data.  Does anyone know of a tool that could index my NAS and then compare any other hard drive, folder, or other media and list what folders/files are not on the NAS.  I believe I could write a script that would md5/sha1 each file on the NAS and put that data into a database. Then the script could compare using those hashes and list differences. I'm hoping for a better solution if one exists.  <answer107695> To close out this question, I didn't really find anything out there already.  I ended up writing a python script that read all the files on the drive and saved an MD5 hash of each one in a database.  Then I created another script that would read the contents of the drive to compare and lookup the MD5 in the database to see if the file already existed. It's not perfect, but it worked.
