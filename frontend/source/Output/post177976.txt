Greek letter shortcuts in Keynote 6.5 <body> I recently switched to Keynote for writing scientific talks. I use tons of greek letters and need a fast way to type them in. I have seen on other questions and forums that people just change the auto-correct settings to replace things like \lambda with the Greek letter. However, in Keynote 6.5 I cant seem to find the auto-correct settings to do this. Its looks like they moved it out of the preferences menu. Anyone know where this is, or have another solution?  <answer177978> Using the Keyboard System Preference, in combination with the Greek keyboard, I was able to get this to work.  Open System Preferences  Keyboard  Select the Keyboard tab and check Show Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar. The flag of your default language should now appear to the right of the Date/Time menu item.  Select the Input Sources tab  Add Greek keyboard  Select the Text tab  select then add code\lambda/code to the Replace field  From the Character Viewer menu bar item, choose the Greek keyboard  Select the With field and type the 'l' key. This should insert the Î» character in this field.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IDvql.png" alt="enter image description here"  From the Character ViewSwitch back to the default keyboard.  Now, whenever you type code\lambda/code you will see this replacement pop-up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLVsS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Repeat with other characters.  <comment210869> This worked great. Only weird thing for me was when I checked 'Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar', it showed some other symbol that brought up some sort of softKey window. Then when I unchecked this box the American flag popped up and everything worked as described. Maybe due to some other setting I have on somewhere. Thanks!
