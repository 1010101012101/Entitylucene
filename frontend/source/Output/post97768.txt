Can an iPad be charged while acting as a USB host? <body> I have an iPad that I would like to leave semi-permanently connected to a USB hub (connected to a couple of MIDI controllers and some USB speakers).  As it stands, I have to remember to unplug it periodically and plug in the charging cable.  I've been looking for a solution that would let me keep the iPad charged while also keeping it connected.  Thinking about it, I realized I don't know if this something supported by the USB standard (let alone by the iPad specifically).  Is it even empossible/em to charge an iPad while it's acting as a USB host?  <answer171200> Personal experience, I've never it.  But USB specification actually has defined such standard, under USB On-The-Go (OTG). A connector named Micro-AB plug will allow a device to be charged and enter host mode. This is also mentioned here on another Stack Exchange site.  Back to the question, is it possible? Probably no. According to this Wikipedia article about Lightning. A lightning-enabled device can act as host to power accessories or as client to be charged, but it uses either...or, so not at the same time.  <comment201403> An accessory does let iPad charge when in used, the 30-pin to HDMI adapter for iPad, but the HDMI signal comes from 30-pin, not USB protocol. <comment201406> Normally an iPad will charge when the usb cable has enough power, maybe your hub doesn't have enough power to also charge your iPad? <comment288960> What iPad are you using?
