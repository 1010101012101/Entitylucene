Pages has stopped continuing a list on Enter <body> Can't figure out how to resolve this issue. The previous behavior is that when creating and editing a list when you press enter you will drop to a new line with a new numbered item.  Somehow, the settings got messed up and now hitting enter on any numbered item will give me a line break but does not continue with the list. I have each one set to "Continue from previous" but it doesn't work for me at all.  How can I set it back to continue all lists when I hit enter?  Edit: Here is an image of the format on a list item:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVnYq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer282537> With your cursor at the end of a list item, Go to the Format Inspector (Paint Brush) and toward the bottom you should see a strongBullets &amp; Lists/strong disclosure arrow.  Check that in the drop down you have selected a bullet style and not strongNone/strong.  strongCAUTION:/strong Hitting kbdReturn/kbd twice will stop the numbering or bullets.

Some apps treat those as separate commands, though idk how that works for laptops with only one key. <comment355972> What do you see under Bullets & Lists in the Text settings in the inspector? <comment356000> Added an edit to show what my page's format looks like.
