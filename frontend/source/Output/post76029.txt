Create stacks on dock and rename category in `Lauchpad` <body> How can I create icon stacks on dock? For example, I want stack the icons of codeWord/code, codeExcel/code, and codePowerpoint/code.  Next is can I rename an application category in codeLauchpad/code?  When I drag &amp; drop an application icon onto another, a new category will be created named codeProduction/code(or codeProduct/code? I can't remember exactly, and no Macs at hand currently). I want to rename the category to something meaningful.  <answer76061> You can rename a category by opening it and clicking the title:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqDMO.png" alt=""  Stacks are just folders. Put aliases to a folder and then drag it to the Dock:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbNYg.png" alt=""  <comment88220> Rename the Launchpad categories, by opening the category, and simply clicking on the category name. You can then edit it. <comment88268> @bassplayer7 Thanks, it works! <comment88277> Thanks, it works! Could you please suggest any mac tutorial for a layman :)? Thank you again.
