Applescript - Open password protected excel file <body> Is there a way for Applescript to open an Excel workbook (.xls) that is password protected?  I see that in the library there are functions to check if a workbook has password, but I do not know the proper syntax for opening a wb with password protection.  precodeTell application "Microsoft Excel"   -- set theWb to path of .... etc.   open theWb with password "abc" ? &lt;--- what should go here? end tell /code/pre  <answer242992> There is a way to open a Excel workbook (xlsx, in my example) which is protected either the workbook and/or the sheet. You can use the following script:  precodeset passwd to "1234" -- whatever you want set theWbpath to "/Users/xxxxx/Desktop/number1.xlsx" -- example path set theWb to "number1.xlsx" -- example file set theSheet to "sheet1" -- example name of sheet tell application "Microsoft Excel"     open theWbpath                     unprotect workbook theWb ¬ --&gt;          password passwd        --&gt; workbook part, can be left out     unprotect sheet theSheet ¬ --&gt;          password passwd        --&gt; sheet part, can be left out end tell /code/pre  <comment299067> I don't know what the sign ¬  means in the AppleScript context so you may have to revise the formatting <comment299087> @klanomath, `¬` is: [The Continuation Character](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/conceptual/ASLR_lexical_conventions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH214-SW9) <comment299692> tell application "Microsoft Excel"  open "Macintosh HD:Users:user:Desktop:fileName.xls"       it stops at this point, and doesn't continue to do the next line of code which is unprotect workbook theWb <comment299693> does it only work for xlsx files? <comment299809> It could be related to the Excel version you use; I tested it with v.15 (actual v). What do you use? I could try it with different Excel versions on some other Macs. <comment299863> I'm using 14.6.4 excel version. <comment301194> Now I tried to solve it for the Excel 14.6.4 version; there are some differences in the protection techniques this version uses compared to the 15.xx one. You can protect the opening process itself; I added a script for this below <comment301195> set theResult to "" set passwd to "1234" -- whatever you want set theWb to "/Volumes/yyy/workbook1.xls" -- example file tell application "Microsoft Excel"  set theResult to open workbook workbook file name theWb ¬   password passwd end tell
