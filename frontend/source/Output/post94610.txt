macbookpro/wireless vlc/qt to a projector <body> Airfoil, connects nicely to my speakers and the 3 macs + pads/phones in the studio connect nicely to it but what about wirelessly sharing the projector?  is there anything (NOT an apple tv) which can connect my projector (has only hdmi/vga/composite) to the rest of the network?  Perhaps a dongle, or wireless thing I can plug in to it? I really dont want an apple tv, just some hardware w. software which i can install to project from any device wirelessly.  Seems simple but I cant find anything ?  Surely there's an answer? Google's not giving me much.  <comment110910> Is your projector WiFi capable ? What projector ? <comment110912> nope its a 'dumb projector', plug something witha signal in an it will work <comment110913> Does your Projector has a USB plug ? <comment110914> Take look at the WUSB (wireless USB to USB connection, that is not WiFi) set up, if your projector has a USB plug. <comment110947> no usb sadly. :-(
