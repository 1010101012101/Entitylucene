Dislike track or playlist recommendation <body> On iOS I have the option to tell Apple Music that I don't like this recommendation. In iTunes this functionality doesn't seem to be present. Is this indeed not possible within iTunes or am I missing something?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvn9J.jpg" alt="I do not like this suggestion -- music app iOS 8.4"  <comment234144> Where are you seeing this don't like option? <comment234285> @unknowndomain tapping and holding on a suggestion on the for you section opens up a menu that offers the "dislike" option.
