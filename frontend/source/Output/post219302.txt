How to turn off Notifications Sounds when OS X is in Do Not Disturb mode? <body> Toggling "Do Not Disturb" blocks banners/alerts for Notifications, but I still hear the little blip and see the app jump up and down when I, for example, get a message.   Is there any way to mute the Notification sounds without muting the entire computer?  This is happening to me on OS X 10.11 El Capitan.  <comment265254> Those aren't notifications, they're alerts. You'd probably have find each app's separate settings if they exist to stop those. <comment265260> So when I get a message, the messages app gives me both a notification AND an alert? Seriously? <comment265266> It shouldn't I use Messages, and it only gives notifications, and added badge count on the icon. It doesn't require my attention, so it shouldn't bounce, make sound etc... <comment265285> In the notification settings I have the option to toggle sounds on a per-application basis. Somehow, when I go into Do Not Disturb mode, these sounds are NOT muted.
