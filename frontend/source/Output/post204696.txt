Why are subscribed podcasts appearing more than once on my iPod touch 5g? <body> After c. 5 years, I 'upgraded' from a 3g touch to a 5g model. I soon noticed that the list of podcasts shown on the iPod was getting longer and longer. There were at least 3 copies of each podcast source in the list.  I'm on iOS 8.4.1 and I just deleted all the podcasts from the iPod and then also from my iTunes and resubscribed to the podcasts I regularly hear.  It's only been a few days but the iPod now shows 2 copies of each subscribed podcast.  Is there anyone who can explain to a simple software engineer what I might be doing wrong? After all I'm not new to the iPod but I cannot figure out what's going wrong here.  <answer210447> I had this issue with multiple copies podcasts on iOS 8.  sThe new version on iOS 9 seems to have fixed this if you also make sure the podcast is subscribed on both iOS and iTunes./s  The alternative is downcast to old iOS which had podcasts as part of Music as that worked perfectly for me.  <comment246807> What version of iOS are you running? That establishes the version of the podcast app for us. <comment246809> @bmike - don't have it with me at the moment. I bought it about 3 weeks ago and updated the OS almost immediately. I'll add the exact version nr this evening... <comment246813> @Mark if you reproduced this on iOS 8 please flag as a duplicate. <comment246829> @bmike I can't close as dup as there is no accepted answer (and I should not answer due to NDA and the probabilty of it changing before release) <comment246925> @Mark - you seem like you're in the know. How do you work around this issue? I only really use the iPod for podcasts and the current handling sucks. Do I have to remove all podcasts from the device before syncing? :-/ <comment254222> I took the upgrade to iOS 9 and the podcasts function much better than iOS 8. I'm not thrilled about the new layout etc but at least each podcast only appears once. <comment254245> @paul - it has got worse for me now which is why I struckout the answer
