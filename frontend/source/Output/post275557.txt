Apps folder: View settings are always being reset <body> I have a small problem with my apps folder (/Applications/).  Whenever I change the view settings, for example, the size of the text, and click "Use as standard", it works fine.  But after some time, definitely after reboot or logout, those settings are not applied anymore and the old, ugly style is being used.  I heard that the file .DS_Store contains these settings. There is none in my apps folder, so I created one, but it didn't even save, no warning or error was given.  In all other folders, this works fine.  Does anybody have an idea to make my apps folder to stick to the chosen view settings permanently?  <answer275560> strong[not solved before I remove this line]/strong  First of all, you can't create the .DS_Store file yourself. Only Finder can do that (and usually will create it after you have first accessed the folder).  In case of the /Applications folder, it might be that you don't have administrator privileges which might prevent saving the .DS_Store file.  So you should emcheck the permissions/em on this folder and set it to writeable by your user. This is not possible however if you're not the owner of your system.  I've searched the net and found other people having similar problems like you.   First thing suggested was to delete the Finder permissions file:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist /code/pre  can you try to do that, then logout/reboot and tell me in a comment if the view settings persist?  <comment346665> Thanks for your answer. I've tried deleting that file, changed the view settings and logged out. When logged back in, it was reset, just like before. BTW: I'm the only user on this machine. How do I set the proper permissions for that folder? <comment346666> CMD + I  on that folder to get the Info window, check Sharing & Permissions part. If you're the only user you're the Admin. Then check if Admin is set to 'read & write' or 'read only'. When it's already read & write the problem is likely not solved in this way.
