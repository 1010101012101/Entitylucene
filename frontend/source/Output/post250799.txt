How to turn off smart lists in Notes app? <body> I'm trying to find a way to disable formatting list in Notes app that is installed on MacOS by default. I go to codeEdit/code - codeSubstitutions/code and there are codeSmart Lists/code, but that option is gray, so I can nor enable or disable it. Version is codeVersion 4.2 (555.10.42)/code. Is there a way to turn off smart lists? I just want to write simple notes purely and not to need to make the codespace/code first, then return to first position and make a codedash/code and then to return to last position.
