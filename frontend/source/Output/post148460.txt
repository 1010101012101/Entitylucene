iCloud back up on iPhone 5c <body> If I back all my data on to iCloud will this free my memory on my phone as I only have 8GB and would like more pics songs etc , hope people can help!   <answer148464> Backing up to iCloud is only a backup, it will not free up space on your iOS device.. you'll need to free up space manually.
