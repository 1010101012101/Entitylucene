How to fix error code -43 (copying files to my samba shares)? <body> When I copy strongsome/strong files/apps to my samba shares (1 running FreeBSD and the other is running Debian Linux), I get an error code -43.   this is the text of the error message  precodeoperation cannot be completed as one or more required items cannot be found /code/pre  This doesn't happen to all apps. I've encountered the problem copying calibre/ripit/textwrangler and possibly more. But I strongdidn't/strong get the error copying Chrome/VNC viewer and possibly more as well.  I've searched the net and I found an Apple support article but I don't think it applies to me.  Any ideas on how this can be avoided or perhaps a workaround? At the moment, the only workaround I can think of is to tar my files first before copying to my network shares.  thanks very much for the help :)  strongupdate:/strong  I tried copying the files using the cp command and I was getting "cannot copy extended attributes" error. After removing the extended attributes via  precodexattr -rc calibre.app /code/pre  and confirming the extended attributes are gone by running   precodexattr calibre.app /code/pre  and I am still getting the same error. I tried copying Google Chrome which I don't have any problem with copying using drag-and-drop and I get no errors at all.  <comment149674> Please post your smb.conf <comment280930> I had a similar situation - copying files between volumes and getting error -43 from the Finder.  But it wasn't Samba shares, it was between partitions on one hard drive.  The linked support article was very suggestive.  After I renamed the target partition to another name, then back to the original name, the problem went away.
