What maximum OpenGL context do the Macbook Pro's support on Bootcamp Windows <body> I'm Looking to get MacBook Pro. Is there a max OpenGL context? I understand that on OS X it is 4.1, does this change when booting in Windows, and is this diferrent or the same for the three models?  Models 2015: 13 inch integrated,  15 inch integrated,  15 inch with amd graphics.  <answer235690> 13 inch integrated: Intel HD graphics - supports OpenGL 4.5   15 inch integrated  Intel iris pro 5200 - supports OpenGL 4.3  15 inch discreet: AMD radeon r9 m370x - supports OpenGL 4.5  <comment285594> It's helpful to provide as much info as possible.  For example, which model years are you referring to? <comment285600> totally missed that - the current versions - 2015 <comment285601> Edit your question to reflect that info.
