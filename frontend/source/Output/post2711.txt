What are some good options for a protective Macbook case? <body> I have a 15" MBP after upgrading from an older 13" Macbook.  Previously I had a http://foof.com.au case which is essentially a lambs wool sleeve.  It made it very handy to constantly slip the laptop in and out of my backpack.  The case would obviously not offer much protection from a fall but it was enough that the laptop didn't get scratched from living in the backpack.  Does anyone have any favourites. I'm particularly interested in lightweight and rugged cases as the 15" is a lot more expensive and I'm going to be a bit more precious about it.  Some sort of rubber such as I have on my 3G iphone seems fairly sensible to me.  Anyway Cheers  <answer2714> Speck  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/id6Wc.jpg" alt="Speck case"  <answer2715> http://twelvesouth.com/products/bookbook/img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ORIhO.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer3181> I can't say enough good things about the various booq cases and sleeves. I have the 17" version of this particular sleeve for my computer and love the pants off of it.  http://www.booqbags.com/laptop-backpacks-laptop-bags/15-inch-macbook-pro-bags/Vyper-M3-macbook-pro-sleeve  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gkboc.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer13898> I am going to shy away from specific recommendations but compare the two models and let you decide what makes more sense in your case.  Unibody mac book pro are made of aluminum which is more prone to scratches, gouges and pressure wearing if grit or sand gets between a rigid case and the mac when compared to older MacBook Pro and similar era plastic MacBooks. (but not nearly as soft as the current shiny when new unibody MacBook construction) This coupled with the great increase in strength due to the unibody makes vinyl stickers a more practical case than with the older macs. (you don't need so much hard shell protection and a thin layer of cosmetic protection might be all the protection you need to invest in)  The new macs are more prone to break rather than bend like the old macs would and they take a whole lot more abuse before showing it in practice. I have seen many portables of both era that basically flew out of a speeding car and landed suddenly on pavement. (Don't forget your mac on the roof of your vehicles, people, even if it's in a nice case.)  Since the 15" mac is larger and heavier, so more padding in a bag or case is needed to protect from drops. Especially drops from waist or chest high to hard ground. It is also more expensive to repair your new mac than a smaller portable. The repair costs for 15 and 17 inch models are capped at $1250 (US prices from Apple for substantial internal and external damage). The 13 inch and smaller macs repair top out just under $800 for equivalent damage. You might consider investing more in a protective case or bag based on the potential for increased repair costs.   Don't forget that even in a cushy padded bag, high G forces or bending can still break internal parts or the glass screen/trackpad even if the external case looks barely marred. The forces needed to leave a half millimeter bend in the case is enough to snap internal parts due to precision design packing maximum function in a minimum space.  <comment2834> +1. Maybe not so high on the "practicality" scale, but oh, OH so gorgeous. <comment14824> Very nice name even though it looks highly impractical for anything other than disguise. <comment14827> I would say go with this or a light vinyl sticker. Your new mac will survive most falls without needing extra protection. Put the rest of your money in a nice padded bag or an insurance rider to cover an accident. <comment14834> "Let's go shopping" questions are off-topic, per our FAQs. Closing.
