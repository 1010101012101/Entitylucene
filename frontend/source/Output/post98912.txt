Is there a systemwide .bash_profile file? <body> The order of directories in my path is messed up, and I'm trying to correct it. Some of the path seems to be coming in from somewhere other than my user bash config files (I'm using both .bashrc and .bash_profile).  Is there a system wide bash_profile (or other config files?) file which is executed before user specific ones? If so, where is it located by default?  <answer98913> The answer seems to be yes.  Check out the FILE section of Bash Man page  precodeFILES    /bin/bash           The bash executable    /etc/profile           The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells    ~/.bash_profile           The personal initialization file, executed for login shells    ~/.bashrc           The individual per-interactive-shell startup file    ~/.bash_logout           The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits    ~/.inputrc           Individual readline initialization file /code/pre  In addition to that, shell paths are also loaded from code/etc/paths/code and the files (if any) in code/etc/paths.d/code by code/usr/libexec/path_helper/code (which is executed as part of code/etc/profile/code).  <comment116248> The path can also be set in `/etc/paths`, files in `/etc/paths.d/`, or in `/etc/launchd.conf`.
