Apple iPad Pro 10.5 Pencil issues <body> I have recently purchased the new 10.5 inch iPad Pro while also owning the 9.7 inch model.  I am an avid user of the pencil, which I use daily for note taking.  Upon switching to the new device, I noticed odd behaviour of the pencil. For example, upon first installation, the Nebo app will ask you to scribble some text using your pencil. Anything I write there looks extremely jittery (although the latency is low, the lines are very jagged):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wXDYl.png" alt="Jittery text"  The exact same thing happens in Microsoft OneNote:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0VOkz.png" alt="New iPad"  On the Old iPad, same apps, same pencil, ... things look decidable smoother:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cx4UI.png" alt="Old iPad"  More detail:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ppda5.png" alt="More detail"  There are two options:  ol liThe new HW, with the newer screen polls the pencil more frequently and apps are not fully optimised for that somehow./li liMy hardware is faulty/li /ol  It would be nice if the community, specifically 10.5 owners could try this out in the apps mentioned.  If my HW is faulty I would like to know sooner rather than later so I can return it.  I have tried all the usual options like device resets, changing pencil and even changing pencil nibs... It is likely not that.  strongEdit/strong  In the Apple Store, display units also run OneNote but this is an older build (15.27 - 160930) vs the most recent App Store build (16.2.1 - 170616).  At least on those units, I do not see the effect.
