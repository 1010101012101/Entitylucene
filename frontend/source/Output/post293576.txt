How to install TexMaker on Mac? <body> I want to install TexMaker 4.5 on Mac OS X 10.9.5. On the official page, I clicked on codeTexmaker 4.5 for MacosxLion (64 bits)/code and opened the folder that is downloaded. It contains the application codetexmaker/code.  I double-clicked it and made a small MWE. If I want to compile it, it says  precodeCould not start the command. "pdflatex" -syntex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex /code/pre  What should I do? Do I have to install LaTeX separately befor installing a compiler?  strongUpdate/strong  I have installed LaTeX separately according to Monomeeth's answer below. Apparently, TexMaker 4.5 did not find them or it was not the correct version.  Next, I installed a version of MacTex manually according to this site, namely the 2016 version. Now TexMaker 4.5 is able to compile a file.  <answer293591> It's not 100% clear to me what you've actually tried, but give this a go:  ol liLaunch Terminal/li liEnter the following command:/li /ol  coderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" &lt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null ; brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask 2&gt; /dev/null/code  ol start="3" liPress enter and wait while the command runs/li liWhen it's complete, enter: codebrew cask install texmaker/code/li /ol  Let me know how you go.  <answer293592> Texmaker is only an editor, you need to install TeX/LaTex separately and configure Texmaker to find the correct binaries. From Configuring the latex related commands:     Texmaker can't compile yours documents if the paths to the LaTeX related commands are wrong.   The default settings should work with the recent and standard LaTeX distributions, but you should have to modify them ("Configure Texmaker" - "Commands").   There are several TeX/LaTeX packages for macOS out there, I'm using MacTeX for several years now.  <comment370465> Completed the 4 points successfully. When I open a `.tex` file, texmaker crashes. In the crash log, I see that TexMaker 5.0.1 was installed, but I need version 4.5 for Mac OS X 10.9.5. So I installed TexMaker 4.5 manually as mantioned in the OP.
