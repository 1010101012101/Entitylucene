Add permanent Allow rule to Firewall without "Allow signed content..." <body> I'm working on an OS X 10.5 PowerMac machine. I want to add a permanent emAllow/em rule for an updated OpenSSH server located at code/usr/local/sbin/sshd/code. I have a firewall rule for it in the Firewall App, but it appears its not persistent. Each time I reboot the machine appears to forget the rule.  This question is similar to How can I permanently allow a firewall rule in OS X Mountain Lion?. However, if you notice, the accepted answer does not really answer the question posed in the title. The difference I am experiencing is I emdo not/em have em"Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections"/em.  How do add a permanent Allow rule to the Firewall without the em"Automatically allow signed software..."/em?  hr  Related, I emdo not/em have em"Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections"/em because I want to ensure some of the signed apps, like Keychain and Social Media apps, do not enjoy the privilege.  At the moment, its not clear to me what the breadth of that setting is, other than emCore Service apps/em. The Keychain is listed as a core service, but I see no need to allow the Keychain to field incoming connections. Also, I don't participate in the social networking experiments, so there's no need to allow the communication. (Related question: What are the services Apple's Firewall considers essential?)
