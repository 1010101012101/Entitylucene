Can I use Airplay without Apple TV or Airport <body> I have my PC, IPad and a AirPlay compatible speaker  My question is:  Can I use AirPlay to hear my IPad music in my speaker only with ITunes software only, or I need necessarily to buy AppleTV or an AirPort in order to use AirPlay?    In order to use AirPlay is necessarily to have AppleTV o an AirPort??  <answer111148> Rogue Amoeba has a few applications that work together for this sort of thing. Check out Airfoil: http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/  <answer111185> If the speaker supports AirPlay then it should show up as an available destination device in control center regardless of what brand of router you are running.   <comment130817> Not direct answer to your question but  http://www.airserver.com/ makes it possible to beam your Ipad back to your mack or PC  got it as part of a bundle a while back seemed to work but have not used extensively try the free trial <comment280431> I run iPad and MBP output to a Denon amp, over an ASUS router.  AirPlay compatibility seems sufficient.  Note however that Macs are occasionallt glitchy wrt selecting AirPlay outputs - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/85623/can-not-select-airplay-device-in-osx/229795#229795
