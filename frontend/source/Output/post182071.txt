Create plist through command line <body> Forgive me if there is a better way todo this, but I have an app that is generated without a plist, this is partly due to the build system that is cross platform. Is there a way to generate a plist from the command line? I looked at codedefaults/code but I can't seem to generate one. I need to be able to set one key codeCFBundleExecutable/code.  Thanks.  <answer182081> The following example creates a codecom.domain.programname.plist/code file in:  code~\Library\Preferences/code  precodedefaults write com.domain.programname CFBundleExecutable $value /code/pre  If you want an codeInfo.plist/code file this example creates one on your Desktop:  precodedefaults write /Users/$USER/Desktop/Info CFBundleExecutable ExecutableName /code/pre  You could set the path to inside the code.app/code bundle, say it's in Applications:  precodedefaults write /Applications/AppName.app/Contents/Info CFBundleExecutable ExecutableName /code/pre  For other permutations read: codeman defaults/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f6p3q.png" alt="Info.plist file"  <comment216604> Plist files are simple xml or text (or binary representations of them). Please check [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27379507/creating-and-writing-into-plist-with-terminal-or-bah-script) <comment216605> Why can't you have plist file on other platforms? It doesn't have to be in binary format. <comment216611> @klanomath Yep I will do that if there is a less error prone method. <comment216612> @MateuszSzlosek I guess there is nothing wrong with having a plist on every platform but that could lead to confusion with developers on Windows/Linux. <comment216613> What do you means by "I looked at `defaults` but I can't seem to generate one."?  I have no problem creating a `.plist` file using `defaults`.  Did you read then man page for it? <comment216614> @user3439894 Yes I did, I must have missunderstood something. I tried `defaults write ...` but it produces nothing, not even an error. <comment216615> @user3439894 I think I messed up on the path for that. If you push that as answer I'll select it. <comment216624> If you want the `.plist` file in a specific location use the fully qualified pathname.  Don't use `~/..` as it might still end up in `~/Library/Preferences`.  The man page example `defaults write  Ìƒ/Desktop/TestFile foo bar` doesn't end up on the Desktop as it says it will (under 10.8.5 anyway).
