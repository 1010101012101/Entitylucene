Lost Contacts icon <body> My wife has lost the Contacts icon on her iPhone 6. Contacts are still listed uner the telephone icon, but there is no Contacts icon. We have looked in the Extras folder and it is not there. We have done a sesrch for Contacts as suggested and there is no indication of what folder it might be in. We also re-set her home screen to factory settings and still nothing. Are there any other ideas? Thanks  <answer280166> It may have been removed.
