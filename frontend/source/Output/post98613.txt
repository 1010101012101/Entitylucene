Open contact group on Mac <body> I just want to use AppleScript to open an existing group in Mac Address Book (v7.1).  precodetell application "Contacts"     set selected of group "friend" to true     activate end tell /code/pre  above is the sample code for what I want.  <answer98733> This probably isn't the best Applescript code ever written but it did work for me to list the people in a specific group (on 10.8 mountain lion).  precodetell application "Contacts"     activate     set grp to first group where (name = "friend")     tell grp         get people     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment117560> tell application "Contacts"  set selected of group "Name of Group" to true  activate  tell application "System Events" to keystroke (key code 99) end tell <comment117561> **I just updated the code for what I want, it's workable for Mac Address Book (v7.1) now.**
