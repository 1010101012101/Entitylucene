Using Applescript to make selections from dropdown menu and Apply <body> I'm trying to write an Applescript that will open a webpage, change the selection in 2 dropdown menus and then click on a button to Apply the changes. I've extracted the IDs for the 2 dropdown menus and the button using Inspect Elements on the webpage but when I try and set the values in the Dropdown menu I get a 'missing value' error.  I'm trying to set 'Daylight Saving:' (DaylightSaving1_ddlDaylightSaving) to be '1 hour' (Value 2) and 'Max Graph Size' (DaysPerGraph1_ddlDaysPerGraph) to be '1 day' (Value 1), then click the Apply button (btnModsApply)  What have I done wrong in the script?  precodetell application "Safari"     tell window 1         set current tab to (make new tab with properties {URL:"http://www.ukho.gov.uk/easytide/easytide/ShowPrediction.aspx?PortID=0036&amp;PredictionLength=7"})     end tell delay 0.1     tell document 1         do JavaScript "document.getElementById('DaylightSaving1_ddlDaylightSaving').value=2;"         do JavaScript "document.getElementById('DaysPerGraph1_ddlDaysPerGraph').value=1;"         do JavaScript "document.getElementById('btnModsApply').submit()"     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer248508> You can use Automator instead of debugging javascript if you prefer that option.  In Automator.app you can set it up to open a new safari tab and then you can use the record feature (red button in the toolbar) to change the dropdown menu and press the button.  <comment307932> Automator doesn't work reliably - selects iTunes instead of Safari. <comment307933> the problem is the last line of javascript is throwing an error - you might need to get to stack overflow to figure out why the page you are looking at is throwing the ["Submit is not a function" error](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/833032/submit-is-not-a-function-error-in-javascript)
