How to use iostat with AppleRAID volume? <body> When I try codeiostat disk5/code, I get the error:    precodeiostat: could not record 'disk5' for monitoring /code/pre  codeIostat/code works with my other drives, and with the individual disks which make up the RAID volume.  How can I get the speed of disk5, which is an AppleRAID volume?  <answer118501> BSD iostat - yeeeecchhhhh. There are some things that Gnu/Linux just does better.  What happens when you try codeiostat -d -n 9/code - that should give you an iostat on the first 9 drives hooked up (if you have 9 drives).  <comment138311> It omits the RAID volume, and it shows each of the 4 disks that make it up. <comment138355> Yes, I was afraid of that. The drive system sees the physical disks not the logical drive. You may be stuck.
