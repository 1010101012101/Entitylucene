Change "add to bookmarks" location under "share to" Chrome in iOS <body> When on iOS mobile and you "share to" Chrome you can save the thing (URL) under "read later" or "add to bookmarks". If you select add to bookmarks, it only saves is under mobile bookmarks though. How can you choose to save it to the bookmarks bar for example? I don't use mobile bookmarks and want easy access to the URL later on my laptop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9bXP.jpg" width="320"
