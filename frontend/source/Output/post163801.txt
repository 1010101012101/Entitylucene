How to unblock extensions in Safari so I can install adblock? <body> I'm trying to install AdBlock Plus so pages like beliefnet.com won't have so many ads. Safari says my extensions are blocked.  HELP?  <answer163806> Make sure Safari has Extensions turned on by going to Safari  Preferences  Extensions and slide the On/Off switch to On.  <comment191825> And in Safari, the Help menu, searching "extensions" didn't get you an answer?
