Reclaiming the display interface of laptop mainboard using external display <body> Instead of replacing a my macbook's broken display, I would like to utilize the Macbook mainboard's display interface with an external monitor.  In what ways is the Macbook's built-in display interface usable without using displays designed for this purpose?   This is a MacBook Pro (Late 2009) 15 inch.    emExample: Is it possible to pin out the mainboard interface to HDMI or DVI?/em  strongImportant: The motivation for this question is that I currently believe that a broken built-in display on a Macbook reduces the number of maximum supported displays by one. I am aware that the external display ports can be used even if the screen is broken, and I am using all of them. I am still at a loss for the missing display in the mean time./strong  <comment221020> You cant use the pin out method. It is for LCD display. Why are you not using the build in external display ports ? <comment221497> Can you share the model of MacBook you have? <comment221685> MacBook Pro (Late 2009) 15"
