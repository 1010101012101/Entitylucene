Globally move mouse pointer and click using VIM keystrokes? <body> I'd like to be able to hit a hot key, and enter a mouse movement mode where I can move the mouse pointer around the screen using VIM keystrokes - regardless of the app I'm in (ie globally for all apps)  For example, just say my mouse mode key was SHIFT+COMMAND+M  ul liI hit SHIFT+COMMAND+M to enter mouse mode/li liI use h,j,k,l to move the cursor around the screen, and possibly some other keys to jump from monitor to monitor/li liI hit the enter key to click, and leave mouse mode, or hit esc to exit mouse mode./li /ul  Are there any apps out there that would let me do this? I'm aware of "Mouse Keys", but I really want to be able to customize:  ul lithe keys I use to move around/li lithe amount of movement that's done by the mouse when a key is pressed./li /ul  <answer139187> A tool that might just help you is Cliclick. With it, you can read the mouse position using the codep:./code command, move the mouse using the codem:x,y/code command, and click using the codec:./code command.  This is a bit of a hack, really, but regarding the multi-monitor support, you can use Slate, where you can programmatically call Cliclick with the coordinates of the mouse in a different monitor. I'm sure there are other alternatives, though. I also used Slate to bind the other first calls to Cliclick.  The "mouse mode" is a bit tougher. In Slate you can create "modal hotkeys" pressing two hotkeys in succession (like ^W in Vim), but no support for whole modes. You could, however, dynamically edit the code.slate.js/code binding file to contain "normal mode" or "mouse mode" bindings each time you change the mode.  I did something similar yesterday, so hope this helps. :)  <answer164283> I use the nifty app: Karabiner: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/  It's useful for major keyboard remapping, and there are packaged config options for using the keyboard to move the mouse, click, and even scrolling!  <comment164045> See [OS X Mountain Lion: Control the pointer using Mouse Keys](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11263) which also works in Mavericks. This is not like Vim but same. <comment164046> It doesn't fulfill the customization requirements listed in the questions though. <comment164047> Thanks for the feedback - I was already aware of "Mouse Keys" but that doesn't work for me as I really want to customize the keys that are used to match VIM.
