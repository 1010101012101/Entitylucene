Is there a music app that lets me start/pause playback by tapping anywhere on screen? <body> I'm looking for an iOS app where, once the music is playing, I can touch anywhere on the screen to pause it, and then start it again.  <answer142521> The CarTunes Music Player app does what you need - there are no buttons, just taps and swipes for all music controls.   Tapping is play/ pause, swiping is next/ previous track etc. Even volume can be adjusted by holding and dragging up/ down.   The app is not free at the moment but does fluctuate in price and is sometimes even free, as can be seen in the App Activity sidebar on App Shopper  <answer142557> Beat Music Player is free at the moment and uses a double tap anywhere on screen to start/stop music  LeechTunes LT is also free and a single tap starts/stops playback (there is a paid version as well)  <comment140326> Are the earplugs an option? If you click on them, the music will stop?
