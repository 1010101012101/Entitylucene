Get specific version macports dependencies <body> Some ports have several versions installed, for example:  precodesqlite3 @3.7.17_0 sqlite3 @3.8.0_0 (active) /code/pre  How do I get dependencies per strongeach of them/strong?  precode$ port deps sqlite3@3.7.17_0 Full Name: sqlite3 @3.8.0.2_0 Library Dependencies: libedit $ port echo depof:sqlite3 and version:3.7.17_0 $ port echo depof:sqlite3 and version:@3.7.17_0 $ /code/pre  No success at the moment.  P.S.: wanted the codedependencies/code tag for this question.  <answer103982> You can't.br Macports dependencies are between ports and not versions.  Only one port used at a time that is the active one Variants and versions of a port can depend on different ports. But different ports and/or variants cannot depend on variants see the Macports FAQ  <answer103983> That looks like either a bug or a limitation with the codedeps/code command to me. A quick look in the MacPorts Guide, and codeport help deps/code doesn't specify any such limitation, though that's not very conclusive.  I'm not sure if you should be able to see dependencies for different strongversions/strong, though I can definitely see different dependencies for different strongvariants/strong.  I have two versions of codeboost/code installed (note the different python variants, but same version):  precode% port installed boost The following ports are currently installed:   boost @1.54.0_0+no_single+no_static+python27 (active)   boost @1.54.0_0+no_single+no_static+python33 /code/pre  And I can check their dependencies independently by referencing them as codeportname@version+variants/code (version &amp; variants being optional):  precode% port deps boost @1.54.0_0+no_single+no_static+python27 Full Name: boost @1.54.0_0+no_single+no_static+python27 Library Dependencies: zlib, expat, bzip2, libiconv, icu, python27  % port deps boost @1.54.0_0+no_single+no_static+python33 Full Name: boost @1.54.0_0+no_single+no_static+python33 Library Dependencies: zlib, expat, bzip2, libiconv, icu, python33 /code/pre  But I also have two versions of codeglib2/code and codepango/code installed at present:  precode% port installed glib2 pango The following ports are currently installed:   glib2 @2.36.4_0   glib2 @2.38.0_0 (active)   pango @1.34.1_1+x11   pango @1.36.0_0+x11 (active) /code/pre  Yet, likewise, cannot see the deps of the inactive versions:  precode% port deps glib2 @2.36.4_0 Full Name: glib2 @2.38.0_1 Extract Dependencies: xz Build Dependencies:   libxml2 Library Dependencies: gettext, libiconv, zlib, libffi, perl5  % port deps pango @1.34.1_1+x11 Full Name: pango @1.36.0_0+x11 Extract Dependencies: xz Build Dependencies:   pkgconfig Library Dependencies: glib2, cairo, gobject-introspection, harfbuzz, Xft2 /code/pre  Both show the newer (active) version rather than the older one, even with the code--index/code argument to deps.  <comment122453> What are you trying to do with this info? <comment122454> There seems to be some difference for *versions* and *variants*, so it may not be quite that simple...? I'm able to see different dependencies for two different installations of boost (same version, different variants). See my answer for specifics. <comment122531> I think the variants can depend on different librariess/binaries etc but they cannot depend on a specific variant of a library <comment122572> @Mark, I want to make a simple Ruby script to draw me a dependencies tree to find if I can deinstall smth useless for me.
