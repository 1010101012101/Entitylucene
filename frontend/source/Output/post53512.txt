How do I install Linux on an Intel iMac with no OS nor CD drive <body> What I want:   ul liLinux on an Intel iMac (Core Duo)./li /ul  What I have:  ul liAn empty PC (17" Intel iMac) with broken CD drive. It's model A1173./li liThis PC with Ubuntu 12.04 and an old Windows Vista partition./li lia USB flash drive and an Ubuntu ISO./li /ul  Problems:  ul liNo CD means the only boot drive I could use is USB./li liThere is no BIOS on Macs, so I can't set boot settings or even see if it detects my USB drive. When I start the machine and press kbdOption/kbd, the first and only thing I see is an old corrupted Windows XP partition and not a single option or additional information./li liSo assuming blindly that the Mac hardware/firmware works normally, I don't have any Mac OS to use any of the tools that I found on different tutorials for building a bootable drive for Macs./li liI can't find much software on Linux/Windows to substitute to those tools, for example among others converting an .iso file (Win/Linux) to .img (Mac I guess). Which makes me think that the scenario where someone like me has Mac hardware but no Mac OS is extremely rare./li liSo other than finding someone that has a Mac I have no solution. So I ask, what would you do? The only thing is it should not involve any money (I know Mac software is rarely free) which also excludes getting any Mac OS unless I can use a free macos.img for VM or restore the original Mac for free./li /ul  <answer53514> Looks like you have all you will need already, you were just missing the following bits of information.  ol liYou should checkout a Ubuntu instructions for Intel Macs, so no need to worry about a BIOS your running EFI. Ubuntu for Intel Macs and additionally the Ubuntu Intel Mac CommunityHelpPages looks to be loaded with lots of resources that you might find helpful./li liSince your iMac is an intel one, you can use a standard Ubuntu ISO built for any x86 PC. However since your iMac is a Core Duo it will need a 32bit Ubuntu as noted on Ubuntu's Mac Community documentation. /li /ol     ... If you have a Core2 Duo Mac (as oppossed to the Core Duo), it is capable of using the AMD64 (64bit) CD otherwise you have to use the standard version...   The standard version meaning a 32bit version.  ol liPick and download a 32bit version of Ubuntu , the Mac documentation pages say going with the latest version should be a good move, yet pick which one works best on your iMac, this may require trial and error./li liFollow the standard How to create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu using the Ubuntu ISO you downloaded above./li liBoot the iMac with the USB stick inserted, if the iMac does not boot into the Ubuntu installer you may need to reboot and hold down the "option" key, and then selcted the USB stick to continue booting into the Ubuntu installer./li /ol  <answer211525> If you have a recovery partition still you could reinstall the OS with no cd by Holding both the Command and R keys on the keyboard once rebooted when you hear the chime noise.  once OS X is back installed follow the guide below in the link.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7osgsM20Nkc  This is the correct way to make a Linux installer USB for use on Apple hardware.  This method to create installer will REQUIRE access to a working Macintosh with an OS installed and working.  download the iso from the following location:  http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop (PLEASE SELECT 32bit iso)  once you create your installer/live USB reboot your computer  hold option at the chime and select the usb.  <answer247735> I think what the issue is here is the EFI intel booting.. first off, I understand the Box in question.. I have and early intel iMac that also has the intel core Duo (two cores but not much shared between the two. You essentially have a machine with two 32bit processors. that live to serve separately.  Without special features of the "soft bios", that is, no Bios Chip on the motherboard the iMac will only boot with certain linux loaders that handle EFI booting properly. I am happily using super pup linux. I have tried booting with 20 differing linux packages and 17 of them have no clue what CDrom "type" I'm using and refuse to boot at all. Cool! soft BIOS..stupid BIOS.  Since the original issue was, no internal CDROM, an external works just fine. I know, I just piked another up at a Good.. second hand store for $3. It boots my iMac at holding the option key. If you are looking for pure 64 bit computing from the core duo.. probably not gonna happen.. beside the memory capacity of the machine is limited.  <comment61212> iMac G5s are PowerPC, not Intel, and there is a BIOS *per se*: it's called Open Firmware and you can do way, way more stuff in there than in any BIOS. <comment61213> Also, .iso and .img are basically the same, and Macs are quite happy to handle .iso images. <comment61411> Question on Super User: http://superuser.com/questions/435866/imac-g5-with-no-os-nor-cd-drive <comment61517> @CajunLuke 1) I meant a usable BIOS, if you KNOW there is one, please tell me how to use it. 2) My g5 IS an intel PC, you shouldn't have edited that out. 3) .iso images may be handled but they still need to be converted to .img even though they're so similar. <comment61518> @sinekonata If it is a G5, it is by definition not Intel, as G5s are PowerPC chips. If it is an Intel iMac, then it's not a G5 iMac, it's an Intel iMac. <comment61521> CajunLuke edited my PC specs out saying it's an intel mac so sorry about that but this answer won't fit. I don't worry about BIOS I worry about not being able to follow [this](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx) tutorial since my lack of macos. And thanks for the 2nd link it'll be useful. <comment61523> @sinekonata Either pick Intel or G5. It's not both. <comment61524> @CajunLuke why don't you believe me? I have the serial number and you don't, the model # I gave should be enough proof... <comment61525> @sinekonata Intel Macs use EFI - use that as the basis of your searches for BIOS-level stuff. <comment61526> @sinekonata I missed the model number the first time, and you mentioned G5 more than Intel, so I assumed you got it right more than you did wrong. I've edited the question to say Intel everywhere and not G5. That's why everyone (including me, MrDaniel, and everyone over at Super User) assumed PowerPC: it looked like the one reference to Intel was a mistake. <comment61575> I think sinekonata may be confusing the two because they actually looked very similar, this is the first Intel iMac. The enclosure and screens look identical between the G5 and the first Intel ones. <comment61580> There is a major error in this answer! The USB creation which you link **only works on Ubuntu** and will not EFI boot on a Mac. However, the [instructions for OSX](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx) are not working on many Macs either. <comment61581> @sinekonata Please report what solution works for you. I've attempted several installations as well, but managed only an installation via USB using BIOS Emulation (no EFI boot). I've used [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) and had to manually create a MBR partition on the flash drive. <comment61584> The instructions as far as I can tell all end in the same results and that is that the contents of the Ubuntu ISO are put on a usb flash drive. Ubuntu is the platform that the OP has now that is working in order to create a USB boot drive. Hence why the link to the Linux instructions. <comment255709> Your description is rather confusing and probably not applicable to all Intel Macs. Also it's unclear how this relates to the problem described in the question. <comment255715> I am not sure I understand your response. installing Linux on an Intel apple could not be easier. I think the question is little vague. are we dual booting here? are we running linux as the main and only OS? My answer does work on all Intel macs. (resolving graphics issues are usually the second step of the install) followed by just getting other proprietary hardware to run correctly. (some macs require additional programing to turn on fans/sensors... ECT) <comment255717> The question talks about how to get a bootable Linux onto Mac hardware. Resolving any post-boot issues would be another question (and off-topic on AD). As for missing details: "You will need the 32bit ISO" - which one, where from? Do I want to run 32bit Linux on a 64bit CPU? What do I do with it once it's downloaded, how do I make a bootable stick? Does pressing Option automatically boot from the stick? How do I use `nomodeset? <comment255730> ok I understand. I will remove the tips that he will need down the road. sorry and I will update with a link to the correct ISO.
