Errors in R console <body> I've recently upgraded to a new MBP (2015 series) and migrated my old machine via a time machine backup. Since the upgrade, I have been receiving error messages in the console of codeR/code at more or less random intervals. The warnings usually appear when I start the codeR.app/code, occasionally when I switch from another app (like codeTextMate/code) back to R.app, and then even more occasionally just on random.   The messages typically look like this:     2016-12-12 10:35:18.696 R[2635:12228] IMKInputSession presentFunctionRowItemTextInputViewWithEndpoint:completionHandler: : emNO/em NSRemoteViewController to client, NSError=Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4099 "The connection from pid 0 was invalidated from this process." UserInfo={NSDebugDescription=The connection from pid 0 was invalidated from this process.}, com.apple.inputmethod.EmojiFunctionRowItem   or this:     2016-12-06 15:05:02.067 R[87426:4480089] IMKClient Stall detected, please Report your user scenario attaching a spindump (or sysdiagnose) that captures the problem - (imkxpc_presentFunctionRowItemTextInputViewWithEndpoint:reply:) block performed very slowly (59.22 secs).   I had already posted a question on Stackoverflow about the latter problem, but have not received any replies. I was hoping that you guys at Ask Different might have an idea of where this error comes from, and how I might be able to fix it.  <comment331543> When you upgraded did you chnage version of macOS? and how was R.app installed <comment331592> My old machine was on the most recent version of Sierra and I updated the new MBP before migrating data via the Time Machine backup. R was migrated via Time Machine. I reinstalled since then, using the Mac Installer from CRAN. I was hoping that would fix the issue but it did not. <comment354053> I also get the same problem on Sierra. Whenever I run code in the terminal in R, open a Quartz window to visualize a plot, then click on the plot, I get the following message in the terminal: IMKInputSession presentFunctionRowItemTextInputViewWithEndpoint:completionHandler: : *NO* NSRemoteViewController to client, NSError=Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4099 "The connection from pid 0 was invalidated from this process."
