Spotify output to AirPlay speakers on iPad <body> I don't see the AirPlay speaker selection gadget on the Spotify IOS client.  ol liIs AirPlay support something the App developer must provide explicitly?/li liIs there a way to force the default audio output from an IOS device to an AirPlay speaker at the system level?/li /ol  <answer17485> D'oh! The AirPlay icon is available in the Spotify client. It is on the emInfo/em page rather than the top page.  That's where volume control is, too.  <comment228368> I get lost in the Spotify.app all the time. Just one of those worthless apps you can't get around when you want a specific service.
