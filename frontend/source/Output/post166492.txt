Using SSHFS with launchd <body> I have a Raspberry Pi I want to automount on my Desktop (Yosemite 10.10.1).  I've installed OSXFuse (with the MacFuse option) and SSHFS both from https://osxfuse.github.io/.  I'm using the password method for now and will establish certificates after I get this problem solved.  The following command works fine from Terminal:  precode/bin/mkdir /Volumes/RaspPi ; echo "mypassword" | /usr/local/bin/sshfs myuserid@192.168.8.16:/ /Volumes/RaspPi -o workaround=rename -o password_stdin -o allow_other -o defer_permissions -ovolname=RaspPi /code/pre  Placing it into a launchd plist worked the first day.  The volume would get mounted and if I ejected it, launchd would remount it.  But subsequently it has failed with the error:  precodekernel[0]: OSXFUSE: user-space initialization failed (4) /code/pre  The RaspPi mountpoint gets created in /Volumes, but the volume doesn't get mounted.  The plist contains these lines:  precode    &lt;string&gt;bash&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/bin/mkdir /Volumes/RaspPi ; echo "mypassword" | /usr/local/bin/sshfs myuserid@192.168.8.16:/ /Volumes/RaspPi -o workaround=rename -o password_stdin -o allow_other -o defer_permissions -ovolname=RaspPi&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  I reviewed a lot of discussion about OSXFuse working via Terminal and not in launchd, but none of the solutions dealt with "initialization failed (4)".  They all seemed to deal with a socket problem and error 57.  I tried a few of those solutions, but they did not help.  Any suggestions?  <answer191462> I got it fixed by adding   precode&lt;key&gt;AbandonProcessGroup&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  More info about it can be found here OSX run script to mount sshfs at login with a plist file  <comment334199> I spent an hour yesterday debugging a sshfs plist I wrote. Adding this fixed it! Thanks!
