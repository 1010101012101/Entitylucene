You will probably attract better answers over at [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com). <comment178184> Like "Digital Color Maker" the System Os X app ? <comment178194> Questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved. Include attempted solutions, why they didn't work, and the expected results. <comment178203> AppleScript questions are on-topic here, so I don't see a problem with having this question on AskDifferent. If you can add some details about what you have tried so far, this would be great. Also, if you want us to move the question to StackOverflow if you don't get good answers here, just flag it for moderator attention.
