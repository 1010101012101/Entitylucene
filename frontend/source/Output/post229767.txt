iPhone Animations Not Playing <body> I'm using an iPhone 6S, iOS s9.2.1/s 9.3.1.  At (seemingly) random times, the animations of the icons falling into the home screen, apps moving up when multitasking, and various other animations stop playing. Everything just appears instantly.  However, the page sliding animation that plays when I press the home button on any page other than the first page still works.br strongEdit:/strong animations within apps still work fine.   Other animations that don't play:  ul lifolders on the home screen/li liopening the control center or the Notification Center from assistive touch /li lithe control center going away when I tap outside it/li liopening an app from multitasking/li linotifications appearing/li linotifications going away/li /ul  Has anyone else experienced this? The only solution I've found is restarting my phone.   However, this is time consuming and intrusive, as I might be doing something when this starts happening.   Does anyone have any other solutions? Simply locking and unlocking does nothing.
