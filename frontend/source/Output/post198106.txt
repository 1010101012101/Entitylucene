Does Spotlight keep a search history? <body> Occasionally, I use Spotlight to quickly compute some expression because I'm too lazy to do it in my head, on paper, or fire up some program. Sometimes I would like to view the result again, but when hitting kbdâŒ˜/kbd-kbdSpace/kbd again, it has disappeared. I'm not sure if this happens only when you search for something else in the meantime or also after some period of time.  The question is, can I somehow cycle back through my previous searches?  System info: strongOSX 10.10.4/strong  <answer245596> I don't think Spotlight keeps a search history. I have confirmed this with numerous web searches. Sorry.  <answer265944> No it does not.  That might be a useful feature.  You can go to http://www.apple.com/feedback/ and click on "macOS" and give feedback/make your suggestion.  <comment302804> Welcome to Ask Different.
