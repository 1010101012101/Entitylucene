OS X El Capitan - How do I specify individual sets of Hot Corners for different Virtual Desktops? <body> I would like to have one virtual desktop where I have the "show desktop" hot corner, and second one where this is disabled, so that I do not always have to change the settings.   Can I customise virtual desktops with individual hot corners, or is there only one global setting for all virtual desktops?  <answer217369> Hot corners are independent of Spaces &amp; are unaware of which Space you're in.  I would say 'it can't be done' but it would be nice to discover I'm wrong :-)  <comment262766> You can add a key to it, such as the command key + hot corner to stop accidental activation. <comment262771> oh, wow, I never spotted thatâ€¦ though I haven't changed my hot corners in 10 years... <comment263027> That's indeed very useful, thanks!
