Notes.app on OS X crashing whenever I make an edit in the iOS app <body> Notes.app on OS X crashes whenever I make an edit in the iOS app and it syncs back down to my Mac. When it crashes, I just open up the app again, and everything is synced up and works perfectly. The crashing is obviously super annoying, though. Has anyone else seen this problem?  <comment147576> Any corrupted notes inside your Notes.app? <comment147579> Possibly... What might make a note corrupted? <comment147580> A crash like that ;) Maybe you can check if one of the notes contain "weird" information or weird characters. -- Do you have many of them? Else you could recreate most of them to check. <comment147644> Thanks! That's a good place to start.
