Forward iMessages and SMS to e-mail? <body> I want to forward all SMS and iMessages received on my iPhone to my e-mail address. I have tried IFTTT, but can't see a way to do it. Has anyone else managed to do this?  <answer171046>    you need to have your email address turned on for iMessage on your   iPhone in order to enable Text Message Forwarding. If you don’t, the   numeric access code will not appear on your iPad or Mac during the   setup process. As soon as you enable your email address for iMessage   (you only need to do this on your iPhone) the numeric access codes   appear as expected. Once you have text message forwarding setup you   can disable your email address again in iMessage as it seems to only   be necessary for the numeric access code setup step, not the actual   text message forwarding itself.`      To enable your email in Messages, grab your iPhone and head to   Settings  Messages  Send &amp; Receive. There, you’ll find all of the   addresses at which you can be reached via iMessage. Enable your iCloud   email address by tapping on it, then head back to your Mac or iPad and   again request the pairing verification code from the Messages app.   This time, you should see a box appear on your iPhone in which you can   enter the code.
