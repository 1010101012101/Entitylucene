How do I turn a Safari Webarchive file into a folder? <body> I understand a Safari webarchive is a single file with the source code and other resources from a web page concatenated into a single file. I found a Macworld article from 2006 describing a program that does just this, but the link to the program is no longer current.  Is there any currently available software that can convert a Safari webarchive file into a more standard format?  <answer123439> There is actually a software. The software is almost as the same as the one in the link you provided.  https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20643/webarchive-folderizer  Mac OS X 10.2 Or Later : Intel / PPC  <answer123615> h2WebArchiveExtractor/h2  I recommend WebArchiveExtractor. You can drag .webarchive files to this app which will extract the file into its individual files in a folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UOb67.png" width="215"  You can customise the output in Preferences, including setting a custom index file name:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GM9M1.png" width="325"  supWebArchiveExtractor is open source on GitHub/sup  <answer187242>    Is there any currently available software that can convert a Safari   webarchive file into a more standard format?   If you are comfortable with command line, there is a tool codetextutil/code on Mac OS for converting webarchive file to txt, html, rtf, rtfd, doc, docx, wordml, or odt.  Example:br codetextutil -convert html /Users/USERNAME/NAME.webarchive/code  hr  For converting webarchive file to pdf, try "Wondershare PDF Editor for Mac". http://www.wondershare.com/pdf/how-to-convert-webarchive-to-pdf.html  <comment243243> The `textutil` command line tool only extracts the top-level html file, and not the CSS or scripts that are also part of the webarchive. (Which is really the whole point of the webarchive.) I have not found a good alternate way to do this from the command line. <comment243247> @Stephen WebArchiveExtractor has an Automator action which can be scripted through the shell. <comment262130> It worked great for me on El Capitan. <comment270517> Despite the caveats, that's the kind of answer I was looking for. A GUI bases solution is quite useless when you would like to convert hundreds of webarchives on a server. <comment364707> This doesn't even extract the original HTML file, but converts it. It's really more like opening an HTML file in TextEdit and reexporting it.
