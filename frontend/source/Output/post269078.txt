iOS Calendar App: Recurring Event Not Showing Location <body> I want to ask this question here to see whether anybody has seen or resolved this problem.  I have a number of recurring (weekly or fortnightly) events in an iCloud calendar entered from my iMac Calendar App. This includes a location address which shows up on the map preview in the calendar.  On more that one iOS device, the events appear, but they do not show the location. When I start to edit the event on the iOS device, the location field is empty.  I have tried refreshing calendars, but it doesnâ€™t help. The worst part is that on some other days, the locations emdo/em appear.  Has anyone seen this or resolved this?
