Wireless keyboard with USB receiver doesn't work <body> I'm trying to connect a wireless "Logitech office cordless desktop 2.4ghz" keyboard with a USB receiver to my Mac but I can't get past this step of the keyboard identification:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/65KHs.png" alt="OS X keyboard pairing dialog"  Also the key next to the left shift is the key with the "&lt;/" on it.  How I can connect the keyboard to my Mac?  <comment231927> On the back of the keyboard it says: "logitech office cordless desktop 2.4ghz" I don't think that's a model name but i can't seem to find any other sort of a name. Also the key next to the left shift is the key with the "/" on it. <comment231939> i don't think the 2.4ghz has anything to do with the WIFI. <comment231940> @Buscar웃SD I don't think it is a wifi keyboard, the OP stated it has a USB receiver. <comment231941> What is the layout of the keyboard? I'm guessing nothing happens when you press the key indicated by the dialog? Have you checked the batteries? <comment231945> They are brilliant instructions. You can immediately identify a generic keyboard type from that key, as it changes from ISO to ANSI, or Mac to PC. On my Mac, it's ` on my PC it's \ Both are EU keyboards. It changes for short or extended keyboards too. <comment231946> The problem wouldn't seem to be what key it is, it's that it's not recognising any keypresses at all. Would that be closer to what you're asking? <comment231947> You could try http://support.logitech.com/en_us/software/logitech-control-center-for-macintosh-os-x but Logitech's Mac support is atrocious for anything other than their dedicated mac-compatible product lines <comment231948> Yes, it just doesn't do anything. <comment231950> @JaimeSantaCruz correct me if I am wrong but the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth both occupy a section of the 2.4 GHz ISM band that is 83 MHz-wide. <comment231960> @Buscar웃SD your absolutely right, just that the OP stated that he had an USB receiver that wouldn't be necessary if the keyboard was Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled. I'd suppose it would state to be compatible with either if it was the case. For what I can see in [one manual](http://download01.logitech.com/web/ftp/pub/pdf/keyboards/office_cordless_desktop2.4ghz_faq.pdf#page4) that may correspond to the keyboard the OP is using, it's some kind of proprietary wireless protocol. Also, [various other devices](http://www.wired.com/2010/09/wireless-explainer/) populate the 2,4GHz band. <comment231972> @JaimeSantaCruz see for your self here http://www.logitech.com/images/pdf/roem/Advanced_24_Unifying_FINAL070709.pdf <comment231973> Exactly, I quote your source: "Logitech Advanced 2.4 GHz proprietary wireless technology" <comment232037> I think, basically, you're screwed. Proprietary hardware & no Mac drivers. Unfortunately, that's Logitech through & through. <comment232851> Ok, i'll just forget the keyboard then. Thanks for the help guys.
