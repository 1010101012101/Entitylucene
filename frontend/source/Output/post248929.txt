Add pronunciation to text to speech <body> Is there any way to add a pronunciation to OSX text to speech service? I've google for the last few hours without a solution.  <answer248955> Yes, you can affect macOS's text to speech pronunciation. Everything you need to know is in Apple's Speech Synthesis in OS X.  Try these two commands in Terminal.app:  precodesay "cat" /code/pre  Now to have the individual letters spelt out:  precodesay "[[char LTRL]] cat [[char NORM]]" /code/pre  See Use Embedded Speech Commands to Fine-Tune Spoken Output for a long list of modifiers.  If you need to speak in another language, be sure to use an appropriate voice.  <comment308634> How do you go about adding it permanently to the text to speech dictionary? Like if I do `say "cat"` again it doesn't spell it out again. <comment308637> Please could you [ask this as a separate question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask). Feel free to link back to this question to provide additional context. <comment308638> Sorry, I didn't properly ask what I wanted, I'll modify the question. <comment308639> A separate question would be better. The answer here is useful and may help others. A new question can then directly address the other aspect, how to permanently store these changes. <comment308641> Are you selecting text and running the contextual menu Start Speaking command? You could create an Automator service that replaces text within a selection before passing it on to be spoken. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/204299/french-narrator/204301#204301 for a service that speaks. <comment308645> I'm currently doing it with automator, just wondering if there's a more natural way. <comment308647> Alright, I posted my other question
