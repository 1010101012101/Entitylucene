Downloading apps <body> I'm trying to update my apps on my phone but it isn't working at all. So I tried to uninstall my messenger 2 days ago and install it again but I can't install it  I don't know why. It always shows that "waiting" it isn't even loading. Now I don't have messenger  Pls help. Thanks   <answer246489> iOS has one central download queue for all system tasks. Check iTunes Store-Downloads and Podcasts-Downloads to see if you have something tying up your downloads.  <comment303786> Did you try to log out of and back into the App Store again (in Settings)? <comment303788> Yes I've tried:( <comment303794> Hi Rey, welcome to the Apple Stack Exchange community!

Start at https://iforgot.apple.com <comment303845> Definitely agree, make sure you recover it first, check the [iForgot](https://iforgot.apple.com) page. <comment303847> And please make sure to tag me using @Leonardo in your comments so I'll get a notification when you write me! <comment304171> Hey guys my messenger is back and I don't know how but THANK YOU!!!!! ☺️☺️
