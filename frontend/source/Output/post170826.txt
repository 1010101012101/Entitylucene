How do I make local camera preview bigger in FaceTime on OS X? <body> In FaceTime on OS X, I'd like to make the little corner preview of the local camera feed bigger in size. Dragging it by the edge doesn't work.  know that there are various hidden configuration strings for FaceTime (for auto-accepting calls, etc.) that control different aspects of the app -- I was wondering if this could be accomplished via one of those?  <comment200908> and using the menu bar - window -zoom is not big enough? <comment200933> @Buscarì›ƒ: That changes the size of the whole window, but the size of the preview of the local camera feed stays the same (it's the little sub-window in the corner, not the whole window). I want to make that little sub-window bigger.
