How does one execute scripts within script bundles? <body> I am trying to make my completely enormous script more comprehensible by splitting it into a main script with bundled scripts to run when called, but I don't seem to understand how to run a bundled script from the main script. What am I doing wrong?  precodeset temp to display dialog "enter desired year (january)" default answer "" set yr to the text returned of temp  set e to yr mod 3  if e = 1 then set SUNyear to "A" if e = 2 then set SUNyear to "B" if e = 0 then set SUNyear to "C"  display dialog SUNyear with title "mainscript result"  set myPath to path to me as text set resPath to myPath &amp; "Contents:Resources"  if SUNyear = "A" then run script "TestRes1.scpt" in scripts folder if SUNyear = "B" then run script "TestRes2.scpt" in scripts folder if SUNyear = "C" then run script "TestRes3.scpt" in scripts folder /code/pre  the problem obviously is that the bundled scripts won't run... Help, anyone?  Oh, and I'm using AppleScript Editor 2.4.3, by the way in case it makes a difference  <comment113256> If you replace 'scripts folder' with the actual path where the scripts are located, does it work? If you replace *run script "TestRes1.scpt" in scripts folder* with something like *display dialog "SUNyear is A"*, does a window show up?
