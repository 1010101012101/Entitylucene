Wake Other Computers from Mac OSX <body> Is there a terminal command within Mac OSX that will allow me to use WOL (Wake On LAN) to wake up other computers? Windows has wolcmd, is there an equivalent within OSX?  I am trying to wake a computer from my rMBP, within my network. My rMBP is connected via WiFi normally, but can also be connected via Thunderbolt GbE connector. The target computer is a Windows machine that I want to wake up before I connect to it using a remote desktop connection.  <answer95255> wolcmd is available for Mac: http://www.depicus.com/wake-on-lan/wake-on-lan-for-apple-mac.aspx  GUI version for $1.99, terminal version is free. Usage is just the same as its Windows counterpart.  <answer121328> The codewakeonlan/code command for command-line can be added to OS X using the homebrew package manager.  <answer229596> Install the wakeonlan package using Homebrew:  code$ brew install wakeonlan/code  (It's a Perl script for waking up computers via Wake-On-LAN magic packets.)  When installed, you can send a "magic packet" from your Terminal to any device using its IP (Internet Protocol) and MAC (Media Access Control) address.  Here's an example of a typical use:  code$ wakeonlan -i 192.168.1.255 -p 1234 01:02:03:04:05:06/code  The scripts takes 2 arguments, the MAC address of the NIC, and an IP address.     Note: The IP address argument is tricky and isn't what you'd think.      For a NIC on your local subnet, use the broadcast-address of this subnet. (e.g. subnet 192.168.10.0 with netmask 255.255.255.0, use 192.168.10.255)   For example, I have a Synology NAS manually configured with the IP address of code10.0.1.100/code with a subnet mask of code255.255.255.0/code and a router address of code10.0.1.1/code.  strongThe correct IP address to use is emnot that of the device/em, but instead the embroadcast-address of the subnet/em./strong  Continuing on my example, I used the following command to successfully wake up my Synology:  code$ wakeonlan -i 10.0.1.255 -p 7 01:02:03:04:05:06/code  em(Naturally, substitute the actual values of your device and network for your situation.)/em  You can get more information from the wakeonlan man page, codeman makeonlan/code, or a quick glossary of commands from codewakeonlan -h/code.  <answer262936> It's probably possible to be installed through the MacPorts package manager as well, but I don't have it installed, can't test it.  <answer287814> Python comes with OS X per default. So you could use this small Python 2 script to send the wake on lan package. Save it as codewakeonlan.py/code or something you like:  precode#!/usr/bin/env python  import socket import sys  if len(sys.argv) &lt; 3:     print "Usage: wakeonlan.py &lt;ADR&gt; &lt;MAC&gt;     (example: 192.168.1.255 00:11:22:33:44:55)"     sys.exit(1)  mac = sys.argv[2] data = ''.join(['FF' * 6, mac.replace(':', '') * 16]) sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1) sock.sendto(data.decode("hex"), (sys.argv[1], 9)) /code/pre  Use it like this:  precodepython wake.py 192.168.1.255 00:11:22:33:44:55 /code/pre  Modify the IP address and MAC address accordingly. The IP address should be the broadcast address of the network.  For easy access you could make this script executable and add it to some directory in your path.  <comment111697> $ ~/bin/wakeonlan server-mac-address-here <comment111703> @Buscar, On my mac (OS X 10.8.4), I get `-bash: /Users/Dygear/bin/wakeonlan: No such file or directory`. <comment111704> Thank you sir! Just what I was looking for! <comment111705> Glad I could help :) <comment313882> I read somewhere, that it will only wake your mac from sleep, and not when it completely powered off. And maybe it also only works on LAN, not WLAN. <comment351129> this should be the accepted answer. Cheers man
