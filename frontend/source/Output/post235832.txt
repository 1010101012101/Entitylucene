How can I stop VLC from lagging when playing mp4 files? <body> VLC tends to have a video lag playback when playing mp4 videos, specifically the ones from railscasts.com. The video will be playing just fine but then the video will freeze, the audio will continue playing, and eventually the video comes back but it is occasionally briefly pixelated. Is there a way I can fix this or better diagnose the issue?  <comment288995> in vlc go to window-Errors and warinngs, and messages. And see the output when the video lags. <comment289078> Thanks @incBrain, I'll look when I get home tonight.
