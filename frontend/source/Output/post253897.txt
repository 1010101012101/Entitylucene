iCloud Drive storage is full <body> I've just upgraded my OS to Sierra and have turned on the "optimize storage" option for iCloud Drive. But strangely I now get a "your iCloud storage is full" message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AFghy.jpg" alt="info size" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tk1ww.jpg" alt="total size" When I checked my local drive, it seems the total size of all folders inside wasn't the same as the iCloud Drive information. When I dive into iCloud preferences the Document size is insanely huge. How do I find out which ones are the large files?  hr  strong[UPDATE]/strong  I don't have any large files in my Documents folder. But it's strange: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IX4bS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment316047> How big is the actual Documents folder on your hard drive? (username  Documents) <comment316050> it's only 786 megabytes @tubedogg <comment316051> Do you have anything else in iCloud storage, such as iCloud Photo Library or a device backup? <comment316052> No I don't think so. I've updated my screenshots. @tubedogg <comment316053> Something's clearly taking 4.7 GB. Login on icloud.com, click Settings on the main screen and there will be a bar categorizing what is taking up room in your storage.
