Watch youtube moview on a Mac using QuickTime <body> Is it possible to watch youtube videos on a Mac using QuickTime as it is on iOS?  How to force Safari to render youtube video stream in QT plugin.  <answer76013> I don't think you can since youtube videos are flash based (or in some cases HTML5 player based).  I did find a link that might help you a little:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2015789?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer76014> I use Videobox  I often have to use Videobox's mini browser. I copy the URL from the YT site to the mini browser.  I set the Videobox output to a QT format. you can even batch downloads. I hope this helps.  <answer76016> Thereâ€™re a couple of Safari extensions that will do this. ClickToPlugin and ClickToFlash.  http://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/  Both versions will swap out the Youtube Player for a standard HTML5 player. The extension also allows you to download the Youtube video.  <comment88301> good work around, but it is quite complicated - copying URL ald watching video in other app. <comment88314> it's not so bad, and I can make a queue to download and convert. But I hope you find something that works for you.
