iPhone backup restore SMS <body> I have had to restore my iPhone 4S to factory settings - wiping everything on the device. Fortunately I have frequent backups so I was able to restore most of the settings and stuff.  However, is there a way (on mac) to restore SMS messages from the backups. I just don't know how to get them back on the device.
