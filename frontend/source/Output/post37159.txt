How to get wiki and profile manager to run on different port <body> Currently the wiki and the profile manager runs on port code443/code (ssl).  We have other services using port 443 on our network, and therefore I cannot port forward that port to my Lion Server.  How can I get the wiki and the profile manager to run on a port other than port 443?  <answer37162> This is only possible in Snow Leopard server and not Lion Server (I think).  <answer37168> So I decided to research "Apache" without specifying "OS X" in my research.  I found that you can change the listen port in a conf file  precode$ mdfind httpd-ssl.conf      # Found     # /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-ssl.conf  $ cd /private/etc/apache2.extra $ sudo nano httpd-ssl.conf      # ctrl + w     # 443      # Change Listen 443 to Listen 4444     # ctrl + o     # ctrl + x /code/pre  emnote: enabling coderoot/code would allow you to listen on port code444/code/em  <comment42175> It may only be possible via a GUI on Snow Leopard, but I'm fairly confident that changes can be made via Terminal since both OS's use Apache to serve web. <comment42181> I can `sudo nano httpd.conf` and change the default listen port for `80` but I can't find the directive for `443`. <comment42187> found it - see my answer.
