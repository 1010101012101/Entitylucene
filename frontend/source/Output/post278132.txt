Command + Backtick broken on macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and 10.12.4 <body> In OS X 10.10, Cmd+` worked flawlessly. Now it's intermittent at best. I haven't changed my workflow or anything--but now the shortcut fail.  If I go into keyboard settings and change the shortcut mapping, it works again for a little bit, but then fails and I have to go change the shortcut again to make it work.  Anyone have any ideas how to diagnose (or fix!) this issue?  <comment350027> What shortcut is Cmd-`?  Is it something custom or specific to an app?  Missing some key details in the is question. <comment350059> CMD+` cycles between all open windows in the active app. It has always worked flawlessly for me. I would try downloading the combo updater for 10.12.3 & installing to see if that fixes the issue. <comment351156> Update didn't fix it, unfortunately.. it's still intermittently weird.  Now on 10.12.4 (16E195)
