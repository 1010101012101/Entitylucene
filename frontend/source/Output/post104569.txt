MS Office for Mac 2011 installed in Russian, can I switch it to English? <body> I have MS Office for Mac 2011 installed in Russian in my MacBook, can I switch it to English? Is it possible? ... or I would have to buy and install English version of MS Office for Mac?  <comment123073> I think you just download the English version and the key for your russian version will work with it.
