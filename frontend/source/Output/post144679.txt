Prevent Spotify using 3G on iPhone <body> On the Spotify iPhone app, there is a manual setting to turn offline mode on or off. Ideally there would be a feature that automatically switches to offline mode as soon as a wifi connection is dropped, and switches back to online mode when connected again. Is there another way to achieve this?  <answer144722> You can switch off cellular data per app. Go to codeSettings/code - codeCellular/code and scroll to the bottom, tap to turn off cellular data for an app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O64kR.png" alt="Image from Apple page"  <comment170463> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about Spotify.
