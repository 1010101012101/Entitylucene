Flash Player Bug? <body> I was trying to listen to some music on MySpace, and it told me img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kzA9j.png" alt="Screenshot"  I refreshed the page, but it still came up with this. I restarted my browser, but the same thing happened. When I tried updating my Flash Player, I noticed that it was version 10.3.183.18. When I tried installing it, it told me that it wouldn't install because I had a newer version of flash installed.  emWhat the heck is going on?!!/em  <answer48235> It's possible that the newer version installed and is waiting for a reboot in order to finalize the update. if not i would say completely uninstall flash as it's decided to bug on you, reboot then reinstall the latest version. Hope this helps! -theternalnoob  <answer48243> You should try running Adobe's Uninstaller then reinstalling Flash.    Once you have, check your installed Flash version and make sure it's 11.2.202.228.  <comment55263> The Flash plug-in doesn't require a full restart, just for the browsers that use it to quit and re-open. <comment129694> Correct question. An intelligent software should provide one working advice. An information which starts with "try the following" looks like a robot random answer.
