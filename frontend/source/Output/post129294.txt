Can't mount a CIFS volume <body> I'm trying to mount a remote volume with cifs. Whenever I try to codemount -t cifs .../code, I get an error saying codemount_cifs/code can't be found. Where can I find it? Or how do I install it?  I'm using OS X 10.9.2 .  <answer129295> i think youÂ´re looking for codemount_smbfs/code :) or codemount -t smbfs .../code  <comment151324> Well, from an Ubuntu machine I use mount -t -cifs and not smbfs (cifs superseded it). <comment151325> CIFS and SMBFS are the same but it depends on the manufacturer of a OS how he will spell it. And OSX are based on FreeBSD which called it SMB. If you need more details please have a look at [Microsoft](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365233%28v=vs.85%29.aspx). <comment151326> From Apple's manual page "Note: You should always use the system mount command and never call mount_smbfs directly." - https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/mount_smbfs.8.html
