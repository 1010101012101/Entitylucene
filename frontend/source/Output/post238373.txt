Auto-correct on my iMac is checked so why is it not working in Apple Mail? <body> "Correct Spelling Automatically" box is checked in Keyboard settings. "Check Spelling As I Type" is checked in in Mail preferences.  With the proper boxes checked, why is iMac Mail not correcting misspellings in emails? Auto-correct is working in Safari when I type this post. On my Macbook Air I am getting autocorrect when typing up emails. On my iPhone it is working. Why not on iMac Mail? Anyone have any ideas?  <comment292338> You also need 'Correct Spelling Automatically' set in Mail. It's not global. <comment292341> Where are you finding that setting? I only see "check spelling automatically as I type." <comment292342> (In Mail itself) ... Edit  Spelling & Grammar  <comment292346> Thx. For some reason that option is greyed out and not available to me. <comment292347> It's only available when you have an email open that you're about to send
