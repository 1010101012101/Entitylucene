bash process stays 20% CPU usage after boot <body> I migrated from a 2011 MBP to a 2012 MBP via Migration Assistent and Time Machine.  Now, when I boot the embash/em process goes to ~20% and stays there forever, with it emlaunchd/em for root and my user. I also notice, that the trackpad really gets unusual responsive. If I force quit the embash/em process, it restarts and does nothing and the system gets back to normal.  What can I do?   I already checked the permissions.   <answer56472> Select that embash/em process in emActivity Monitor/em and click emInspect/em, then switch to emOpen Files and Ports/em tab. This should give you some clue on how that process was started and what it is doing. Otherwise update your question with that info, someone surely will help you here  <comment64840> Can you add the output of `ps aux |Â grep bash` or similar? Most probably `bash` is executing some shell script which eats a lot of performance. Has Spotlight completed the initial indexing already?
