Any way to edit metadata of MKV files (without re-encoding)? <body> When watching a MKV file from the web in VLC, the title bar (see "#1" in image below) seems to be pulled from metadata, not the filename.  If you open the “Get Info” panel in VLC, you can change the title (“#2”) and then click “Save Metadata” (“#3”), but when the file is re-opened, the old information is shown.  I have not found any other Mac apps which can edit MKV metadata. Several offer to edit mp4 metadata, but that isn’t what I need.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vI4AA.jpg" alt="VLC annotated screenshot"  <answer219837> I have found a way to do this using codemkvpropedit/code which is part of mkvtoolnix.  codemkvpropedit "foo.mkv" -e info -s title="This Is The Title"/code  There is a GUI wrapper for this app and other Mac installation instructions available at the official website.  <answer233786> MetaX for Windows will tag MKV files (as well as MP4, M4V, WMV, and AVI's).  It also searches the internet for the information to use for tagging (cover art, actors, ...)  <answer273021> As an addition one could use codemkvpropedit/code in a bash script to set the title of all mkv files in a directory. (Given the filename is the desired title.)  precode#!/bin/bash  # This script takes all mkv files in the current directory and sets the filename # (without .mkv) as its title in metadata  for mkvfile in *.mkv; do     mkvpropedit "$mkvfile" -e info -s title="${mkvfile::-4}" done /code/pre
