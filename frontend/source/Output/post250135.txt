What's the best version of SoundFlower for 10.9.5? <body> So, surprise, surprise, there is no "one" version of SoundFlower. There are many.   I had thought that SoundFlower came from Cycling. But going over there on GitHub (https://github.com/Cycling74/Soundflower) shows that it is now assigned to RogueAmoeba, which in turn was forked from akhudek, which in turn comes from a Google Code repository.  See https://github.com/akhudek/Soundflower/network for this in a visual graph.  So, which is the best version for 10.9.5?  Goals:br 1. No spamming the console! (YC's fork does this; oddly, it's not in the github picture).br 2. No sudden failures or audio loops. This is happening to me on the version I have, dated aug 6 2012 (a 1.6.6 modified for about 6 devices instead of 2)br 3. Ideally, doesn't start at volume 0, so I don't have to manually adjust the volume up at reboot (this was emso/em annoying to track down).  Bonus points:br 1. Does not use the sandbox restrictions. I use Jack Router, which uses unix-domain sockets, which is blocked by the sandbox.br 2. Works well with OBS (OBS apparently has two ways of reading a soundflower device, but only one of them works with the version I have.)
