How to Speed Up Guest OS in Macbook Air 2013-Mid? <body> I followed the post here about emSolution for Slow Ubuntu in VirtualBox/em.  It is not targeted for OS X.  I am feeling rather slow video play (not native) in the system emMacbook Air 2013-Mid/em.  I feel that some of emdefault/em settings of VB5 may not be appropriate for the system, especially in the video play.  My settings  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pK3Lo.png" alt="enter image description here"  where   ul liless RAM for guest OS than host OS (2 &lt; 8 GB)/li lidynamic space 50 GB so does not end too early/li liSystem  Acceleration  Nested paging On; PAE/NX On; Paravirtualization Default (here, the new VB5 choses KVM automatically); /li liSystem  Processor  1 CPU (so Host OS has two)/li liDisplay  Memory  128 GB (can be too much, slowing the system)/li /ul  h2Video play results/h2  Playing just youtube video in Guest OS makes the OS X run in its max where the first process is emVirtualBox VM/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0YTv3.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2USB/h2  I let USB be 1, although the VB5 should support USB3.

VB is not the only choice. Native run is the best case scenario. You need to have some benchmark. VB does badly at the moment. <comment288521> "Suggestions for future improvements" doesn't sound like a question somehow. <comment288522> @patrix It is body. Question is at the end. Current answers about the topic are very bad. You need to have some benchmark to rate those. Native is the goal. If you cannot measure, you lose. <comment288524> There are no answers here at all?! How does the edit you made about running natively make it easier to find answers in any way?
