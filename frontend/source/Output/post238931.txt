How can I monitor network in OS X? <body> I met a problem recently.  Sometimes the Google shows me a page says that my computer is sending frequent requests to Google so that I must enter the number in the picture to continue to use Google's services.  Obviously, I would not do such thing.  The applications installed in my Mac are all from trusted sources(e.g. official websites).  I have no idea 'who' is doing such thing.  How can I monitor the network to find out the 'worngdoer'.  <answer238932> Try typing netstat in terminal.app First I would type codeman netstat/code to get a better understanding of how it works and what it is capable of and what the results mean.  Try searching a tutorial about the command on stackexchange or youtube.  <answer238944> I have found out the reason.  Since I am in China, for some formidable reasons, I use the Shadowsocks with a strongpublic account/strong to connect to the Google.  <comment293098> What connection to the Internet do you use? If it was some kind of shared network with a proxy for multiple nodes, it might not necessarily be the problem with your computer. <comment293099> Yep, I've seen this if there's too many hosts on a single IP (NAT), especially if everyone searches the same thing all at once, like in a classroom. <comment293750> This is not the answer to your question, but to your problem.
