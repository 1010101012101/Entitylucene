How to restore iMac with Time Machine? <body> I'm trying to restore all my content. On boot I press &amp; hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd R /kbd.br This takes me to the Internet Recovery option, yet I want to restore from my Time Machine backup.   What could be the problem?  <answer213710> If the drive is completely empty &amp; doesn't even have a recovery partition, then the Mac will automatically go to Internet Recovery if you hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd R /kbd at boot.  To prevent this, hold the kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd key at the chimes &amp; choose your Time Machine volume to boot from. You should then find the option to Restore from Time Machine Backup.
