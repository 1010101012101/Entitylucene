Is there a command similar to Linux's command-not-found? <body> Most Linux operating systems have a package like codecommand-not-found/code (http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/command-not-found), which provides suggestions when a shell command was not found, e.g. because the command was misspelt.  precode➜ puthon No command 'puthon' found, did you mean:  Command 'python' from package 'python-minimal' (main)  Command 'python' from package 'python3' (main) /code/pre  Is there similar functionality for OS X, e.g. through Homebrew?  <answer181767> Searching Google for "homebrew command-not-found" (without the quotes) one of the results was: Ubuntu’s command-not-found equivalent for Homebrew on OSX  I have not personally tried using it, so I cannot comment on how well it may work.  <answer181804> One option is to use codezsh/code, which has a codeCORRECT/code option that will suggest commands with a "nearby" spelling. Personally, I use codezsh/code and codeprezto/code, which results in this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RkuJN.png" alt="zsh and prezto auto correct"  It's nice because the command is red while typing if it's not a valid program name, which means I usually catch the typo before I even press enter. Valid command names are green, though, so I know when I've typed it right.  codezsh/code can be installed via homebrew, and then adding something like codeprezto/code on top of that is easy (it's just a codegit clone .../code, codeln -s .../code, and codechsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh/code).  <answer202055> I created Homebrew-command-not-found just for that. It works exactly as you would expect, and supports 4800+ Homebrew formulae. We currently support Bash and Zsh, and there’s an open pull-request for Fish support.  However it’s currently limited to correct spellings, e.g.:  precode$ ghc The program 'ghc' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:   brew install ghc $ ghv ghv: command not found /code/pre  Install it with codebrew tap homebrew/command-not-found/code, then add the following line to your code~/.bashrc/code/code~/.zshrc/code:  precodeif brew command command-not-found-init &gt; /dev/null; then eval "$(brew command-not-found-init)"; fi /code/pre  We’d welcome a PR for misspelling support, though.  <comment243679> `Homebrew-command-not-found` creator here. It works well but doesn’t support misspellings.
