Safari handling of feed: URLs <body> When clicking on feed: links (e.g. feed://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index/), newer versions of Safari (guess it's since version 8) keep asking me, whether I want to add the feed to my Safari sidebar. On older Safari versions in contrast, my Feed app was opened to handle the feed subscription (which currently still happens, when clicking "Cancel" in the shown dialog).  Is there a setting to disable the Safari-integrated feed handling and directly hand the link to my external RSS reader?
