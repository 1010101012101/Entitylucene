iOS Music: Some albums are unable to play/download from iTunes Match <body> I've used iTunes Match for about 4 years.  The phenomenon I'd explain below hadn't been observed before, but had been observed since I bought a new iPhone 7 and try to play music on it.  (I'm actually unsure.  It might be longer ago than I guess.)  I recorded the video to explain what I've experienced:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IneM71vCIYY  Some albums are unable to play/download.  These albums are all uploaded to iTunes Match, and these can be played/downloaded on iTunes on Mac.  (These cannot be played/downloaded on Apple Music for Android either.)  The following facts are what I doubt if these caused the problem:  ul liI currently use both of Apple Music subscription and iTunes Match at a time./li liWhen I used only iTunes Match (Apple Music subscription isn't released yet at that time), I hadn't observed any problem.  I used iPhone 6 last year, and there was no problem â€” the albums currently I can't play/download were okay back then./li liMy next phone was Android, and I started to subscribe Apple Music then.  However, I'm not sure whether these albums were okay at that time, because I immediately switched to iPhone 7 again.  My first observation of the phenomenon was experienced at that time./li liiTunes on my two Macs have no problem with these albums (which I can't play/download on my iPhone)./li /ul  I haven't find any common features between the albums having the problem.  I firstly doubted Japanese music, but I observed the same problem on non-Japanese albums as well.  Some of them were bought using my other account of iTMS Japan, and some of them were ripped from discs I have.  My primary account is of iTMS US.  iTunes Match and Apple Music subscription belong to my primary account (iTMS US).  Is this a problem that only I experience?  What solution would be there?  <comment333700> I once had problem with downloading specific track and iTunes support resolved that issue.
