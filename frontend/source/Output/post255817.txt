Outlook 2016 Reminders in Mac Notifications <body> Mac version: 10.11.6  Outlook for Mac version: 15.26.1  I have reminders as a separate app, but I would like show them in native Mac notifications (i.e coming from top right corner) How can I do that?  Thanks!  <comment318741> How do you mean you have Reminders as a seperate app? It's build in Outlook right? <comment318742> One option is to load up your agenda in the Calendar app, that will show notifications on the top right of MacOS
