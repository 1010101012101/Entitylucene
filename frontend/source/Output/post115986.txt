iOS Still showing 3G up to 30 seconds after WiFi connection <body> I created a hotspot with hostapd (CU8188CU) + dnsmasq on my Raspberry Pi (running Raspbian) and test the connection by various device.  It seems that iOS (tested on iPhone 4S 6.1.3) takes up to 30 seconds to connect to this hotspot even when the IP address arrives in around 2 seconds but the network icon still remains 3G. Android (tested on Nexus 4 AOKP 4.4.2) takes around 5 seconds to connect and OS X (tested with 2011 15" MBP OS X 10.9.1) and Arch Linux on a ThinkPad E130 also result in mostly same result.  I tried switching my Pi to ArchLinuxARM with newer version of hostapd for CU8188CU but end user reported longer connection time.  The iPhone tested could connect to my home router almost instantly.  I suspect that iOS is performing internet connectivity check. Is there any way I could skip this?  Hotspot settings:  ul liChannel 4/li liNo authentication/li liIP 172.16.0.10 - 172.16.0.250/li liTried both giving out no gateway address and with one/li liThere are no internet connectivity, only intranet./li /ul  <comment136088> I believe it checks for a connection to the configured DNS server. <comment136436> The DNS server is working fine as Android phones can resolve the DNS correctly. I tried spoofing apple.com/library/test/success.html but got mixed result. Also it seems that even with 3G icon on I can access intranet site with IP address, but not the DNS name.
