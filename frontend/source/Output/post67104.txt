eclipse RCP juno 64 bit crashes on Mac OS X <body> I'm trying to install eclipse RCP 64 bit version on my Mac (10.7.5).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5KnKe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Whenever I tried to launch eclipse, I got this crash screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3F8E.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I tried to start eclipse using command line, I got codeSegmentation fault: 11/code error message.   What might be wrong? RCP 32bit works fine, and eclipse classic 64bit version works also fine.   And it is just OK to use RCP 32bit version on Lion?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QkhjJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer67206> The problem was from extracting downloaded tar file. I used pathfinder for untar it, but something might be wrong. I used codetar xvf/code and now everything works fine.
