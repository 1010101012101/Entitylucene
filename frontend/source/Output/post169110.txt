Microsoft word 2011 not correcting words in OS X <body> I am using Microsoft Word for Mac 2011.   Recently, I have noticed that the application is not highlighting my typos and spelling mistakes, neither autocorrecting it.   I have checked some online helps but nothing is helping at all.   Anyone using Word on Mac facing the same issue?  Any resolution?   OS: Yosemite  Office 2011  <answer169438> The solution to my question is here:   Go to strongTools/strong  strongLanguage.../strong  Select your preferred language. For me it was strongEnglish(US)/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/532FI.png" alt="enter image description here"
