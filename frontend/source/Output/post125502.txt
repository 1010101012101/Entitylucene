Cron job keeps running, not in any crontabs <body> Some time ago I set up a cron job that would run a shell script to update my dynamic DNS. I've since done the proper Mac thing and switched over to launchd to handle that job and any other scheduled tasks I might have. As part of this process, I removed all cron jobs from my user's crontab (the only user on the machine) and also checked to make sure root's crontab was empty (it is).  However, the cron job keeps running. I know this, because I'm always greeted with "You have mail." when I open a terminal window, which then has tons and tons of messages from cron announcing that it couldn't complete it's job.  Here's a sample of the mail subjects:  precodeLast login: Tue Mar 25 12:19:31 on ttys002 You have mail. imac:~ dongohuber$ mail Mail version 8.1 6/6/93.  Type ? for help.

I'm afraid I'm not sure exactly how often (I just deleted the last giant batch of them -- I'll update this when the next one comes in), but they're definitely emnot/em appearing at the rate the cron job was set for, which was strongonce every 5 minutes/strong. Of course, this could be a function of the mailer daemon and not the phantom cron job, so I don't know if that matters.  And the messages themselves look like this:  precode    Message 1: From MAILER-DAEMON  Mon Mar 17 18:57:27 2014 X-Original-To: dongohuber@server.homenetwork.private Delivered-To: dongohuber@server.homenetwork.private Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2014 18:57:21 -0400 (EDT) From: MAILER-DAEMON@server.homenetwork.private (Mail Delivery System) Subject: Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender To: dongohuber@server.homenetwork.private Auto-Submitted: auto-replied MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/report; report-type=delivery-status;         boundary="0A1C11B3DE54.1395097041/server.homenetwork.private"  This is a MIME-encapsulated message.  --0A1C11B3DE54.1395097041/server.homenetwork.private Content-Description: Notification Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii  This is the mail system at host server.homenetwork.private.

I have no idea where this cron job is coming from or how I can stop it. Here's what the computer reports for the crontabs for my user (which is also the one named in the mail, unless I'm totally misinterpreting it) and root:  precodeimac:~ dongohuber$ crontab -l crontab: no crontab for dongohuber imac:~ dongohuber$ sudo crontab -l crontab: no crontab for root imac:~ dongohuber$ /code/pre  Where the heck is the cron job coming from and how can I get rid of it? If it matters, I'm running Mavericks.  <answer125571> You may want to check the following location, as this is where OS X stores crontabs:  strong/usr/lib/cron/tabs//strong  There may be a crontab which is stored there which is running your job. This is a directory that needs root privileges to access, so you may need to drop into a root shell using the codesudo -s/code command before you'll be able to go into this directory.  <comment146886> I note that the 10 emails you show were all sent at the same time - how many did you get when you has this running normally? <comment146888> I'm honestly not sure -- when it was running normally, the script file was in the place that it was supposed to be, so it wasn't mailing me. However, that question made be realize something about the time, which I've updated my question with. <comment146894> Why is mail connecting to port 10024  ? <comment146895> Does `sudo ls /var/cron/tabs` find any crontab files? <comment146896> Gordon, nope: `ls: /var/cron/tabs: No such file or directory` <comment146897> Mark: I have no idea. To the best of my knowledge, mail has never been configured in any way on my machine. I'd never seen it show up in Terminal until this incident. <comment146910> Check `/etc/crontab`. That is the system crontab. It is separate from the per-user crontab you would get for `crontab -l` as root. <comment146911> As near as I can tell, this doesn't exist in Mavericks. Or am I missing something? I get this: `cat: /etc/crontab: No such file or directory` <comment146912> It's not there by default, but if it were there, it would read it. I thought that might be it....
