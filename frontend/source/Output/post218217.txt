Change output color of terminal (in Mac) to be different from typed text color <body> I know how to change the color of ls output, but I would like to change the color of all terminal output. To make clear what I mean, below is a picture of my terminal. My text color is orange. However, I would want the code-bash: p: command not found/code, codetest/code, and the output of codedf/code to be a different color, so that it is easier to see the difference between what I type. Is this possible?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MVsl.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  This is how it looks with @jmhindle answer. You can change the number after setaf for a different color (e.g. 2 for green).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vXm99.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer218736> I think you can do this by installing a DEBUG trap in ~/.bash_profile.  See the answer to this superuser question.  I added the following:  precodepreexec() {      tput setaf 4     : } preexec_invoke_exec() {     [ -n "$COMP_LINE" ] &amp;&amp; return     local this_command=`HISTTIMEFORMATE= history 1 | sed -e "s/^[ ]*[0-9]*[ ]*//"`;     preexec "$this_command" }  trap 'preexec_invoke_exec' DEBUG /code/pre  tput setaf 4 changes foreground colour to blue.  <comment264564> Thanks! I'll update my question to include how it looks now <comment282609> `while :; do [ "${i:=0}" -lt 8 ] || i=0; tput setaf "$i"; sleep .5; : "$((i++))"; done &`  A good (and non-destructive) prank.  ;)  (To get rid of itâ€”`kill %1` followed by `tput setaf 7`.)
