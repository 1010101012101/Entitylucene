How can I prevent iTunes from automatically downloading podcasts? <body> I listen to podcasts, but almost always on my iPhone (by downloading them on the iPhone directly) and almost never on my computer through iTunes. I do sync my iPhone with iTunes. However, any time I open iTunes, it tries to automatically download new podcast episodes. Is there a way to prevent this?  I tried plugging in my iPhone, going to the Podcasts tab, and unchecking Sync Podcasts, but this resulted in a dialog box asking if I'm sure I do not want to sync podcasts, and informing me that if I continue, all existing podcasts on my iPhone will be deleted. That's not my desired result, of course.  <answer101619> What you observe is the default setting for podcasts in iTunes, which is to download the most recent episode of a podcast.  To avoid this, follow these steps:    ol liGo to strongPodcasts/strong in the iTunes Library pop-up menu.  /li liSelect a podcast.  /li listrongRight click and choose "Settings"/strong (or alternatively, click on the gear icon next to the podcast title on the episode list on the right)./li liIn the strongPodcast Settings/strong dialog, under the "strongSettings for:"/strong dropdown, select strong"Podcasts Defaults"/strong (this would apply your changes to all podcasts).  /li liIn the strong"When new episodes are available:"/strong dropdown, select strong"Do nothing"/strong (the default option being em"Download the most recent one"/em).  /li liClick OK./li /ol  With this change, iTunes will never download new episodes for any of your podcasts. If you wish to change this setting only for specific podcasts, you can do so by selecting the specific podcast in the "Settings for:" dropdown and/or by changing the defaults.  <answer258821> For anyone coming across this now, in the latest version of iTunes (~v12.5.1) it's much easier to prevent downloads for all podcasts you're subscribed to.   Steps:  ol liGo to "Podcasts" in the menubar dropdown. /li liIn the second column of your subscribed podcasts, at the bottom there's two buttons, "Refresh" and "Defaults...", click "Defaults..."/li liIn the popup, set "Download Episodes" to "Off". /li /ol  <answer266522> For Windows iTunes I've found the setting here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b5zWr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment119710> That seems to be working perfectly, thanks! <comment179388> @M K  I think this setting is per podcast only. How to set it automatically for all existing and future podcasts I would subscribe <comment323658> Does this override podcasts adding before changing the default setting? <comment323823> @tubedogg if there are podcasts already downloaded, it asks you if you'd like to keep or remove them. <comment334157> Funnily enough, I cannot get that page to display anymore. Maybe it's only on first visit.
