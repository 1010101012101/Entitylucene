Connect New MacBook (USB-C) to Apple Cinema Display 30" (DVI) <body> Because Apple Thunderbolt Display reflects the whole room, I still use the matte 30" Apple Cinema Display.

Here is one that I found:  https://www.amazon.com/CableCreation-USB-C-Adapter-Macbook-Chromebook/dp/B0125TZW24/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467348424&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=usb-c+to+dvi+adapter  On the link it says that it should work with the new USB-C MacBook.  <answer260281> You need to find a USB-C to dual-link DVI adapter.  The first hit on Google, for example, is this:  StarTech USB-C to DVI Adapter CDP2DVI  <answer261623> I believe there's current no way of doing this :(  <answer265496> After trying at least 9 different adapters, I finally found one that worked! USB-C to MiniDisplayPort: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CJHHTR8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  You'll also need a USB to USB-C if you want to use your Cinema as a USB hub as I did. As far as I can see, there are no USB+DVI to USB-C adapters except this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MD0XXMI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  It works, but only up to 1280 x 800.  <answer271949> there IS a solution to this Problem, I searched and purchased quite a few adapters but finally I got it to work:  strong1) Purchase this USB-C to Display Port adapter:/strong https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00YBH6WDM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  strong2) Purchase this Display Port to "Active Dual Link DVI". It is important that it is an active converter and not a passive one:/strong https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00856WJH8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  Sorry for the German pages but I am sure you find it also in other countries stores.  Connect that combination and also don't forget to connect the active converters power through USB.  If it starts with a scaled resolution, don't worry, there is a key combination (option or command scaled resolution) and you get the highest one.  Works like a charm! I know its pricy but I love my 30" Cinema Display. I also got my old MOTU Firewire audio interface with apples TB3 to T2 and then TB2 to FW and an additional FW cable from Belkin to run.  Now I use my exact same setup as with my old MacPro but its the MacBook Pro 15" with Touch bar. Logic Pro with a Project of 40+ Audio Tracks does put a load of 50% to the system :-)  If you need more info just answer here, I can help :-)  Andreas  <answer271968> You'll need a USB-C to DVI adapter to connect the 30" Apple Cinema Display to your USB-C Macbook. This $22 one, by Cable Matters, supports resolutions of up to 2560x1600 (the same as your monitor) and works with Thunderbolt 3 and the new 2016 MBP.  I'm sure a commenter will be quick to point out that it's not a dual-link DVI adapter, but it doesn't have to be: it allows all 2560x1600 resolution through its single link (well enough, in fact, to trick most reviewers into thinking it's dual-link). It will still push 2K resolution to your Cinema Display.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zR348.jpg" alt="Image of the adapter"  strongEdit:/strong If you don't have a DVI-to-DVI cable (which you'll need to connect the monitor to the adapter), I recommend this gold-plated one.  <answer272111> After weeks of trial and error, I have finally achieved 2560x1600 resolution on my Apple 30-inch Cinema Display connected to my MacBook Pro,15-inch, 2016 laptop.  The trick is to go from USB-C to Mini Display Port (MDP), then to dual-link DVI. Unfortunately, this does take two adapters, but at least the full monitor's resolution is supported.  I used the following adapters:  ul liUSB Type C Adapter (Amazon Link)/li liDual-link DVI adapter (Monoprice Link)/li /ul  Also to note, the DVI adapter needs to be powered by the attached USB connector, and the monitor break out cable USB also needs to be attached to the MacBook.  A bit of a cabling challenge, but everything is now working 100%. Andreas came up with a substantially similar solution, but with different brands and gets the answer bonus!  <comment325802> Note:  this is ***NOT*** a dual link DVI adapter, it only supports up to 1080p resolution <comment327611> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed. <comment334814> Unfortunately the CDP2DVI does not provide a "true DVI-D Dual-Link signal" - I'm not sure why they say it "supports dual-link video resolutions up to 2560x1600" - more info at https://www.startech.com/uk/AV/usb-c-video-adapters/usb-c-dvi-adapter~CDP2DVI <comment341222> Thanks, but I wouldn't agree that getting 1280x800 on a 30" cinema display is "working". <comment341858> Let me know how my answer is, if it helps or not! I'd be happy to help more/modify it with new information. <comment341980> Sorry, but the product page you linked has this warning from the manufacturer: USB-C to DVI uses DisplayPort Alternate mode to convert the signal to DVI. Older displays such as the Apple 30-inch Cinema Display may require a true DVI-Dual Link signal and not support the maximum video resolution.   This answer does not allow the Apple 30" Cinema Display to display its full resolution. I wish it did. <comment342018> I actually ended up with the same approach, just different brands of adapters using mini display port rather than full size display port. This is the best solution to date. Thanks! <comment344806> @owlswipe can you confirm this works with Apple's 30 inch cinema display? <comment344905> @TJez I can't, sorry :/. I don't have a cinema display. You can [look at matching reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Thunderbolt-Compatible-Adapter/product-reviews/B012B58JRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&filterByKeyword=cinema+display) though, which seem kind of positive. <comment362361> The monoprice link is dead. Can you provide details for the adapters so we can search on other sites? <comment362903> The link is still working for me. The complete product name is "Mini DisplayPort 1.1 + USB to Dual-Link DVI Adapter" <comment368165> I would not expect that to work. It says it supports up to 1920x1200 but you actually need 2560x1600.
