The Purchased page in the iTunes Store isn’t the place to download your past purchases. Instead, go to Music: My Music and wait for everything to show up after logging in to the iTunes Store. After your music library have loaded, press Command–A, right-click, and choose Make available offline. This will fetch everything in one go..
