How launchd StartInterval behaves after long sleep? <body> I have a 21,600secs (4hours) job using launchd.plist.  I have 2 mac, main and sub.  With main mac, my plist works fine.  But with sub mac, which is wakes up 3~4 times per week, my plist does not seems to run properly.    Apple's man page for launchd.plist describes:     If the system is asleep, the job will        be started the next time the computer wakes up.  If multiple intervals transpire before the computer is        woken, those events will be coalesced into one event upon wake from sleep.   But if sleep time is longer than 86,400secs (1day), I can't find out how the counter works.    Does anyone know how startinterval works after over a day?
