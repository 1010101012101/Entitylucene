Is there a way to hide the unread count badge in Mountain Lion's Mail.app? <body> Mail.app used to have the ability to hide the unread count badge, as shown on this 37signals blog post:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zHQjS.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seems that Apple has removed this in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Is there any way to restore this functionality and remove the badge?  <answer58006> With the advent of Notification Center, the display of badges on any app can now be managed alongside display of banners, popups, and other notification-related settings.  Go to the codeNotifications/code preference pane in codeSystem Preferences/code, and select the Mail app from the list - the option to turn off the Dock badge should be there.  You may need to restart Mail for this change to take effect, though on 10.8.4 I do not.  <comment66779> There must be a way as I had the Dock count turned off before the upgrade and it is still off after the upgrade. However, I don't see any further options. <comment66788> That *totally* works, and didn't even occur to me. Many thanks. <comment83073> Works for Skype as well! Awesome! <comment162218> It turns out you need to quit Mail and restart for the Notification Center changes to take effect.
