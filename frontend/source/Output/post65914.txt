missing Login Items for managed account <body> MacBook Air running 10..8.1.  I have a script that I'd like to add to the Login Items for a managed account.  When logged in as the Administrator, the Login Items button is present.  When I select the managed account, the Login Items is missing.  Parental Controls are enabled for the managed account.  How can I access the Login Items for a managed account?  <answer65936> A managed account (despite being named emmanaged/em) can only have Login Items set when logged in. It cannot be managed from a separate Admin account.  I had to promote the account to Admin, log in as that account and add the items to the Login Items, then demote the account back to manage.
