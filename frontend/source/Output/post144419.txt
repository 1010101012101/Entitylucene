Having trouble with Google Applications on my iPhone <body> I have an iPhone 5 and I have been using Google Hangouts as well as Google Voice for quite some time but both apps have suddenly stopped working. I deleted the Google Hangouts App and reinstalled it but when I open the app and click on the Get started button a little bubble pops up that says Unable to add account. The Google Voice app still send notifications when there is activity but there is no content when I open the app and when I click on settings I get an error that simply says Network Error (0). The Hangouts app still rings when I am receiving an incoming call but I cannot answer it. I did not chagne any settings. I downloaded the Google Plus app to see if I could get it to work but I had no luck with that, when I open the Google Plus app I get an error that says Can't connect to Google. Please check your network connection and try again, but my internet connection is just fine. all other apps and websites are working just fine. I CAN go to Google.com but I cannot go to Plus.google.com or Google.com/voice. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVlOW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
