How do I connect my Mac to wifi automatically? <body> I have a Macbook Pro running Os X, but it doesn't connect to Wifi automatically. If I turn Wifi on, I then have to manually select the network. Is there some way to change this behaviour?  <answer8999> Mac OS X should automatically join any known networks, as reported in the network applet. After you select the Airport service in the list of the network connection, you can click on the emAdvanced/em button, which will show a dialog that allows you to select your preferred networks, and to sort them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dC78C.png" alt="first screenshot"    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwYIO.png" alt="second screenshot"  The Mac will not automatically connect if it doesn't find any of the preferred networks, or if the preferred network requires a "password" that is unknown to the Mac.  <answer61256> In the Wi-Fi preferences, go into the advanced tab and drag your home Wi-Fi network to the top of the list. Remember to lock your settings once you are done. This should auto-connect once you switch on your AirPort.  <comment9545> Sorry, I should have added that the network is in preferred networks and that the password should be correct as it was auto-entered (I opened up the screen above, then added a new network by selecting a network I was already connected to) <comment9593> If there are more networks available, it is possible the Mac doesn't understand to which you want to connect (even though it should follow the priorities given in the preferred networks). Verify the password is the correct one; if you entered one already, remove the network from the list of the preferred networks, and try again to connect. Also, verify the router is not blocking the computer basing on its MAC/IP. <comment58006> I'd like to add that the same happened to me (with MBA 2011, 13", 10.7.2) when I switch from work to home: at home, the MBA can't automatically connect to my own —preferred— network, because there is another more "powerful" that is shown first in the list of networks. (Although this is randomly…) <comment343636> did you ever find a fix for this?  My laptop has started acting like this the last few months.
