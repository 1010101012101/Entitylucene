How to determine what process controls key combinations? <body> I'd like to determine which process is handling a particular key combination. I've looked through the System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts list. I've also looked through another utility (Alfred) I use and cannot find the key combo in question listed.  Anyone know of a tool that will show which processes are registered as global hotkey handlers?  <comment105565> Several menu bar apps have the ability to launch or activate using a global hotkey. What does the global hotkey in question do if I may ask? <comment105625> It's currently bringing up an app called Dash. I checked Dash's options though and no global hotkey is set. <comment105899> If it's the same app in the App Store (the documentation snippets app), did you try looking at Preferences  General  Global Search Shortcut?
