Is there a way to access/see all files stored in iCloud to one account? <body> I am aware that there is a online view under icloud.com, and there is a OS X and iPhone app for iCloud.  Why I am asking, is:     I deleted all of my iCloud files (so I thought), and emptied the whole   drive. One year later, I installed 1Password on my Mac, activated   iCloud Drive again, and there it was: "Do you want to use your old   iCloud file?"   So there are hidden files which stay there, no matter what.strongI thought I deleted everything, but somehow there were files missing or still there./strong     So what is the best way to view the iCloud Drive content?   <answer239094> All of your iCloud Drive content will be shown here: https://www.icloud.com/#iclouddrive.   strongHowever, 1Password does not store data in iCloud Drive/strong: it stores your passwords (encrypted) in iCloud Documents and Data, which is a separate part of iCloud.   To access your Documents and Data, on an iOS device: open the Settings app, go to iCloud, tap Storage, and tap Manage Storage.  You'll see a section called Documents and Data under the Backups section if you do indeed have documents and data stored in iCloud. You can edit/delete the data of each app here.
