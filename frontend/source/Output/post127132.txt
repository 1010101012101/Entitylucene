Changed user name but files are now unaccessible <body> I changed the home user name using http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1428 and now search in Mail and Finder only show me files I've accessed since the change. This is a major issue for me.   How can I fix this OR revert back safely?   I use Time Machine but my attempt to restore to the time before I made the change did not work.  <answer127137> Go to Macintosh HD&lt; Users&lt; you should find your account name here &lt; desktop&lt; right click get info&lt; give your self permission  then apply this permission to all encloused items   <answer127144> Make sure that all the permissions are correct on your home folder.br You can use the ACL tool on the Recovery HD to do this:  ol liBoot into the Recovery HD using ⌘R./li liRun coderesetpassword/code in Terminal (available from Utilities → Terminal)./li liSelect your account from the drop-down list./li liClick the Reset button for strongReset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs/strong./li /ol  <comment148991> Just to be clear, did you change the account name, the user folder name or both? <comment149014> I'd tried the above but when I go to mail - search I still only get mail I've opened since I made the change in the results list, same with finder. Is there possibly an index file or something that needs to be deleted or re-indexed. Idk - it's a stretch but I'm really at a loss... <comment149022> It's been a few days so what I can say for sure is that I followed the guide above. <comment149046> I've tried to do this a few times but the command doesn't boot me into Recovery HD or at least when I go to terminal and type in resetpassword the command isn't recognized...? <comment149056> Try to re index the HDD, this could be done if you go to Apple system prefrences spotlight privacy then, drag the HDD from desktop and then drag it out, this will trigger the re indexing for your hard drive. <comment149206> I'm sorry I don't understand "drag the HDD from the desktop" drag it to where? Thanks. <comment149276> forget about the drag in and drage out. all what you have to do in spotlight privacy  tab is to add your hdd then remove it and this will trigger the re indexing <comment149283> Ding ding ding winner winner! Thank you! Worked for both finder and mail. Happy camper, thanks again.
