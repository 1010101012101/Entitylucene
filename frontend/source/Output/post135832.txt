Empty files been generated under user root directory <body> I have noticed today that 8 weird files appear under my user root (~/) directory. When I did a ls command these file names appears to be in time format (hh:mm:ss) followed by a comma, some numbers and a question mark. When I opened these files in text editor it appears to be empty. Also the file name seems to be empty when view under Finder.  Here are those files:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/aq1gDZS.jpg" alt="random files generated"  and what they look like in Finder:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/KCpTIC4.png" alt="random files generated Finder"  I'd been scanning the net but cannot find anything relevant to my problem. If it helps, on 12th June 9:11am(when those files were generated) I was playing with .tmux.conf, and working on a rails app, also I think I have been switching ruby between 1.9.3-p547 and 2.1.1 . (I'm on OSX 10.9.3.)  <comment161044> This question is off-topic for stackoverflow for a few reasons, but primarily because it doesn't really involve programming, at least, not the way it's phrased.

Normally, if I'm paying attention, I'll `cd /tmp` first, but if I forget then I dump junk into `~`. I wouldn't be surprised if you did this and then forgot about it. <comment161048> This question appears to be off-topic because it is not about programming. Perhaps [Super User](http://superuser.com/) or [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/) would be a better place to ask.
