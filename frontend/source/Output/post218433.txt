New icons come up as default file icon in El Capitan <body> I'm not able to properly set icons, I've tried with *.icns and *.pngs.  I'm on a El Capitan, MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)  Does this seem familiar to anyone?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BnI2K.gif" alt="enter image description here"  EDIT: I should mention I don't want to disable any security  <answer218447> Try changing the icon using Liteicon.  It's a simple application solely able to change icons for applications and some system icons. And if you are changing icons for several applications it should be a simpler and faster way to do it.  <answer218534> In El Capitain you have to:  1. Open the "new" image you want to set as folder icon on Preview 2. Select the image from the window 3. Copy/Paste in the Get Info folder Icon Worked for me :)img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cj4c0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer218557> Try opening the icon in Safari then dragging it from there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a7WrS.png" alt="Dragging the image from Safari"  <comment264059> You are supposed to copy and paste the actual picture of the icon not drag and drop the file there. <comment264075> Unfortunately Liteicon doesn't play well with El Capitan :( https://github.com/tinalatif/flat.icns/issues/216 <comment264076> You can actually do both (or in my case, can't actually do either :P ) <comment264079> The problem you're linking too only applies to system apps - which the app in your example (Spotify) isn't - so that should work for you. <comment264080> Ok, I guess its an option. For me _personally_ I'm looking for a fix to OSX rather than an app as its just a single icon I want to change. But thanks for the suggestion. <comment264081> However if you are trying to change system apps icons I don't believe that can be done anymore (neither manually or with Liteicon) because of the new security settings referenced in your github link. <comment264082> Yeah sounds like this is just a bug. Oh well. <comment264199> This method is analogous to clicking and dragging an image on the _Get Info_ icon (which should also work for you). Unfortunately on my system, this does not work. <comment264228> I'm very surprised but it worked perfectly. <comment264232> Glad to hear. I remembered having this problem back in 10.6 so it's definitely not something new!
