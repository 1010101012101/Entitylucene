Apple ID Password requirements <body> As you know, the Apple ID Password must meet some minimum requirements, such as having at least one lower case letter, one capital letter, one number, etc.  So, how come sometimes I see a customer putting in a password just 4 characters long?  I am thinking probably if it is a very old password, never changed before, it can be still used as a valid Apple ID Password? Or what?  <answer128832> It's most likely the case that they have a very old Apple ID and haven't changed their passwords since creating their account. I don't know if Apple had lower password requirements in the early days of iTunes/Apple ID, right now they require 8 character passwords as a minimum it seems.  <answer153735> There are two types of passwords, the strongdevice/strong passcode and the strongappleid/strong password.  The device passcode gives you access to unlock the device, and it can be as short as a 4 digit PIN.  The AppleID password must be 9 (I think. It's either says "8" or "more than 8") or more characters long, contain at least one capital, one lowercase, and use at least one number or special character.
