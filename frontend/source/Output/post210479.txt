Undeletable directory with several subdirectories <body> I have noticed a folder on / called "Previous System". After checking that it did not have anything I need, I moved it to the trash. However, when emptying the trash, I get a "file in use" error.  When I attempt to use coderm/code in the Terminal to perform the delete, this happens:  precode# rm -rf .Trash/Previous\ System rm: .Trash/Previous System/private/tmp/coreutils20150822-26525-1gnqu7f/coreutils-8.24/confdir-14B---/&lt;SNIP&gt;confdir-14B---: No space left on device &lt;several "no space left on device" errors removed&gt; rm: .Trash/Previous System/private/tmp/coreutils20150822-26525-1gnqu7f/coreutils-8.24/confdir-14B---&lt;SNIP&gt;/confdir-14B---: Directory not empty rm: .Trash/Previous System/private/tmp/coreutils20150822-26525-1gnqu7f/coreutils-8.24/confdir-14B---: Directory not empty rm: .Trash/Previous System: Directory not empty /code/pre  The unedited output shows an error for each 'confdir-14B---' recursion. They are directories, not symbolic links.  Free space is not an issue, codedf -h/code reports I have 56 GiB available.  <answer210481> Found the solution here: https://superuser.com/a/981772  Basically, codecd/code to the start of the recursive folders, and repeatedly run  codefor FILE in $(ls); do mv $FILE a; cd a; done/code  This will rename the next folder to  "a" and codecd/code into it. Eventually, this should reach the end of the recursion and/or allow deletion.  <comment254039> Did you already try? <comment254041> I see that you found an answer that works, but I was going to suggest trying this after rebooting as soon as you can get a terminal window open or trying in Single User Mode as root. <comment254216> @rubynorails while I didn't mention it, I did try deleting the directory in Single User Mode, and the same result occurred.
