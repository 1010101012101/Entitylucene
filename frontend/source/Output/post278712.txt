Application monitoring software? <body> I'm running Fiery Command Workstation on a Mac and it tends to crash every couple of days.  I've been looking in the Console but it shows any events for FCW that are a few days old, not for the days I know it crashed.  Can anyone recommend software that can monitor specific apps so that when they hang or crash, it gets logged (and as a bonus, send out email notifications)?  <comment350877> What version of macOS are you using? <comment351070> El Capitan, 10.11.6
