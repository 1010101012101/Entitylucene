Finder wont copy all files <body> I'm trying to copy all files from an SD Card DCIM folder in to a folder in my Documents.   What I do step my step (in Finder): Open SD card  Open DCIM folder Press Command + A (select all), then do Command + C (copy)  Open another Finder Window, go to Documents, find the folder, do Command + V (paste)  After operation is complete, in the status bar I view the number of files. The folder has about 300-400 less photos than the DCIM folder in the SD card.  So I repeat the copy procedure, click Skip duplicates, and again it copes some files, but not all.  After repeating the procedure 2-3 times, both folders have the same number of files.   No erorrs are reported when copying.   Why is it not copying all the files the first time around?  <comment332435> 1. Are you giving it time to actually list everything in the folder before selecting all? 2. Have you considered using Image Capture to do the task instead? It has an import all option & doesn't require you to dig around in DCIM <comment332436> 1. Yes, copy dialog disappears, presuming completed. 2. I dont need the photos in my Photos app, I need them in my Documents folder (dont ask...). <comment332439> 1. that's not what I asked & 2. That's the default, but not the only destination available. <comment332442> To clarify - Image Capture is the 'magic' behind Photos, it's the actual importer. It saves having to dig around in DCIM at all, it just finds all the photos, can import them to wherever you tell it & optionally delete afterwards. I use it daily to import up to 16GB of 30MB RAW files from my DSLR; it's never failed me once. Digging around in DCIM is for Windows users ;) <comment332453> Right, but in this case we have to rename the photos, and it's just complicated... It's complete reverse of what a normal photographer would do :) <comment332455> Your call - but I'd say a copy operation is just that... a copy. Afterwards you can do what you like. <comment332462> Is there any reason you are copying and pasting (using the clipboard) as opposed to dragging? Select all the images and drag them to the destination folder. This will make a copy of them in the destination folder without the difficulty of copying them first to the clipboard. <comment332508> Coming from a more advanced window user, where shortucts are faster. I can try the drag and drop to see if it will change things.
