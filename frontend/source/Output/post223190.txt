MacBook Pro, Yosemite: change Finder shortcuts <body> I want to reassign kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd F /kbd to a custom command, but Finder reserves it to open 'All My Files'.  I have looked around Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts, but the Finder shortcuts do not seem to be listed, so I cannot remove them.  Is there any way to remove the Finder shortcuts so I can assign them to what I want?  Many thanks,  Will.  <answer223221> You first have to assign 'All My Files' to something else [choose some complicated junk you'll never need]br You cannot remove a default, only reassign it.  Then you can add your chosen alternative with kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd F /kbd .br I used Documents to demonstrate, as it was just below  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ra56P.png" alt="enter image description here"  System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts.br Finder [in fact no app] will not exist as a listed app until after you make the first shortcut for it.br To set up the first one, click + then select Finder from the drop menu; add your menu title, "All My Files" then your 'junk' key command.br After that, selecting the 'Finder' header from the list will auto-populate the app drop menu, making subsequent entries quicker.  <comment270651> Thanks for the reply.  My problem is that I cannot find 'All My Files' (or the parent 'Finder') in the Shortcuts tab of the keyboard preferences.  What do you select in the left-hand pane in that tab (unfortunately obscured in your screenshot)? <comment270730> It's App Shortcuts. Finder won't exist as an item in that list until you add the first key command for it. I'll update the answer.
