Notes - iCloud.com vs me.com <body> I am having a problem seeing all of my notes between my devices. Unfortunately, my primary iCloud account is @me.com. When my newer computer was set up, it was set up with @iCloud.com since @me.com is no longer around. I have the iCloud account as an alias and it works for everything but Notes. I can't figure out how to change my Notes on the Mac to integrate into my mobile devices. If I could just Airdrop, I could at least have the critical ones come through. Any advice?  <answer294691> As @Tetsujin said, iCloud.com, me.com and mac.com are all the same, the latter two are alias' of iCloud.  In Notes on the mac select View  Show Folders. You should now see where your notes are being saved and will have a heading for "iCloud" and "On my Mac". If you don't see "On my Mac". Select from the menubar Notes  Preferences and check the box "Enable the On My Mac Account".  You can now drag notes from the list in the middle to the groups on the left.   <comment371803> me.com is still around... so is mac.com if you owned one of those addresses way back when <comment371818> on the left of your notes app do you have option to use your iCloud or your computer? <comment372136> On my Mac side, all of my Notes are under iCloud saved to the iCloud drive with the iCloud.com On my iPad & iPhone, the Notes are saved to iCloud with the me.com address. The iCloud.com is listed as an Alias under the me.com (primary) account. In Notes on the Mac, I do not have NotesPreferences with a box for enable the On My Mac Account. All I really want to know is why, if they are all saved to iCloud with both extensions on the account, they are not syncing. iPhone & iPad sync together but neither with the Mac.
