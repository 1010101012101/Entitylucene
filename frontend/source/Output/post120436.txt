how do i "check" my songs in Itunes <body> I'm on PC with Microsoft Windows Vista.  iTunes was stuck for forced it to close.  When I reopened iTunes all 5000 of my songs were unchecked.    How do I put the check mark back on all of them?   <answer120437> Select all the Songs:  Then kbd crtl/kbd click to get the contextual menu.

I selected about 20 songs to test, checked the box at the top,  and it check the whole 5000.  Is 5k song a lot to manage with I tunes?
