Can't download Google Chrome on my Mac! <body> I'm on the page http://google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html  There is a large blue button "Download Chrome" and below it "For Mac OS X 10.6 or later".  I click on the button. Result: the whole screen goes gray, and all links are de-activated, like a "lightbox" effect, and nothing else?!

You should get a pop-up with terms to accept next, then the download after that. <comment205707> your safari's out of date, btw, though idk if that makes any difference; as is your OS, if that really is 10.10.0 then that would be first thing to do, get it up to date. <comment205910> My OS it out of date? I'm really surprised, because this is a brand new 3-month old computer! <comment205912> I did try rebooting. Didn't help. <comment205913> Check System Prefs  App Store. I'm guessing you have Updates switched off. Or look at the App Store app itself & select the Updates tab at the top. There have been 2 bugfix Yosemite releases since 10.10.0 - current is 10.10.2 - also updates to Safari, current is 8.0.3 (10600.3.18). <comment253524> In my case it was the AdBlock safari plugin, I had to disable it for the chrome installed to start downloading.
