How to ask for a mail folder in applescript? <body> I apologise in advance since this will be a long question. I hope that somebody with applescript knowledge can help me. I am transferring whole of my Windows machines to Apple and I am stuck with one last little annoying thing. Within Outlook I had a macro running that asked me where to file a mail after sending it. I am used to file projects in separate folders and have the incoming and outgoing mail there together. Most of the items I send BTW go into the trash folder. In other words, my sent items folders is always empty.  For reference purposes I attach the original macro below.  I tried this through rules but now understand that Mail does not support rules on sent items. Then I ended up with the automator and applescript. I have found some examples on the internet that move selected mails to a specific (preset) folder. That is however not what I need, I need the script to ask me every time what folder to use.  The next thing I cannot found is some kind of automatic trigger when I send a mail. It would for instance be possible through an option "when a mail gets stored in sent mail". Or something similar. The next best thing is just a key board shortcut that starts the macro although this is pretty close to doing it manually by just moving sent mail to a specific folder.  Anyway, I hope my question is clear and some intelligent applescript guru amongst you has a way to deal with this.  Thanks in advance!
