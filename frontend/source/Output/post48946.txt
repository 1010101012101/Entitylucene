Swipe To Delete songs in a playlist <body> Is it possible to delete a song from a playlist with a 'swipe to delete'? I thought this was possible, but I am not able to do this. I'm running iOS 5.0.1.   <answer48959> Swipe to delete only appears to happen in the 'Songs' tab of the Music app. To remove songs from a playlist I only get the option of hitting Edit at the top of the playlist, then using the red icon on the left of the song name. - iOS 5.1  <answer48965> You're right. You strongcan't/strong delete songs in a playlist with a swipe. Only the way Nathan described. Hit the "Edit" button on top of the window, and remove the songs with the familiar red emroad sign/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9u0Cc.png" width="320"    You should be able to do this with a swipe on a whole Playlists, Artists, Songs, Albums, â€¦  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vKghv.png" width="320"    And make note you can't delete songs with a swipe from iCloud.
