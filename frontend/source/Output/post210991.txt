rm all mdfind results, handling pathnames with spaces <body> I already solved this with sed, but there must be a better way to handle spaces. I have run into this with some my scripts as well.  precodemdfind '(kMDItemFSName=*.ipsw)' /code/pre  returns  precode/Volumes/disk/november 2014/Users/someuser/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates/iPhone4,2_6.1_12B411_Restore.ipsw /code/pre  when trying to pipe this, it breaks because of the spaces. i tried several methods including  precoderm $(mdfind '(kMDItemFSName=*.ipsw)')  mdfind '(kMDItemFSName=*.ipsw)' |xargs rm -vf /code/pre  the only solution i found was  precodemdfind '(kMDItemFSName=*.ipsw)' |sed -e 's/ /\\ /g' |xargs rm -vf /code/pre  but there must be a better way.  Thanks for your help!  <answer210995> You can use codemdfind -0/code to print a null character after each path.  Then, codexargs -0/code to parse the list on each null character instead of using the default whitespace.  <comment254769> it works, what more can i say <comment353568> I'm having this same issue, could someone please elaborate on this answer?  I don't understand what exactly to do with the information. <comment353638> @JonathanvanClute, what is the trouble you're having?  If you need help with mdfind, I'd suggest opening a new question.  This one is mainly concerned with running a command on each of the results of mdfind (in this case, the command is "rm -vf"), when the mdfind list has pathnames which contain whitespace.  By telling mdfind to put a null character at the end of each item it finds, and telling xargs to look for the null character when deciding which results to run the command on, the original question was solved. <comment353639> I'm having an issue with spaces in a path and mdfind, but seem to have fixed it by quoting the variable that stored the path that contained a space.  My problem was that I have little idea what the answer is talking about.  I'm not a programmer so this answer is essentially a fragment, which while appearing to address my exact issue, was not fleshed out enough for me to have any idea how to use it.  I think I'm already set though so, thanks anyway!
