What is the latest version of OS X that I can run on a Black MacBook 4,1 (Early 2008 model?) <body> I would like to run OS X El Capitan on an older, black codeMacBook 4,1/code (Early 2008 model with 2GB of RAM).  However, after looking at the El Capitan specifications, it appears that OS X 10.11 requires at least a "strongLate 2008 Aluminium/strong" unibody MacBook.  My strongfirst question/strong is:  ul liDoes anyone here have OS X 10.11 running on a codeMacBook 4,1/code?/li /ul  Probably a more realistic strongsecond question/strong is:   ul liWhat is the latest version of OS X that I can get running on a codeMacBook 4,1/code Early 2008 model?/li /ul  <answer212930> As you mentioned, OS X El Capitan will run on the MacBook (13-inch Aluminium, Late 2008) model, known as codeMacBook 5,1/code.   The stronglatest version of OS X/strong that you can get running on a codeMacBook 4,1/code (strongEarly 2008 model/strong) is strongMac OS X 10.7.5/strong. El Capitan will strongnot run/strong on the non-Aluminium 2008 models (Early or Late).  I have verified this information against the Mactracker app (not affiliated with Mactracker in any way).  <answer217416> you can use this hacked EFI to boot 10.11 on older 64bit CPUs with 32bit EFI https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader  <answer242197> I did run the mac 4.1 on El capitan, it runs very smooth, however I not sure what I did wrong , my mouse and key board were not functional, again with 2 GB of ram the elcapitan ran better then I expected, I downgraded with a clean install of the mountain lion after that 10.6.0 as the computer ran 10 times faster on it.  bottom line elcapitan was possible, the EFI was not working , so I had to use options in my boot.  any ways it does run and I am not an expert.    <comment257299> Correct. The reason for the OS X Lion 10.7.5 cutoff is the hardware uses a 32-bit EFI. Mountain Lion and later require a 64-bit EFI. <comment257301> As AruAkise correctly states, Lion is the latest you can install. With only 2GB RAM, you will find Lion to be a painful experience, i.e., incredibly slow. The MacBook4,1 unofficially handles a maximum of 6GB RAM. If you're planning on sticking with such old hardware, it's a good upgrade, as is an SSD. It's worth noting that Apple will no longer repair this system in case of breakage (outside of Cali.) and Lion no longer receives security updates. As such, it might be time to consider a newer system. (Written on an Early 2008 MacBook4,1, 6GB RAM, 960GB SSD.)
