Fully charged MacBook Air turns off when power cord removed <body> I have a Macbook Air, 2009, with a recently replaced apple battery in December 2012. Recently, when power cord comes off, the computer shuts down. Also, usually will not restart unless power cord is attached. Any help with this would be appreciated. DH  <answer254180> h2The battery is dead./h2  The computer (in this case your MacBook Air) turns off because there is no more charge in the battery.  When you try to turn it on and can't unless you have your power adapter plugged in is a sure sign that the battery is completely discharged.  There are a number of utilities that you can get (paid and free) that will look at your battery status:  ul licoconutBattery/li liWatts/li liBattery Health/li /ul  These are all good, but in my opinion, I would much rather use built in tools to get this info.  Using Terminal, just issue the command:  precodesystem_profiler SPPowerDataType /code/pre  That will give you all the power settings related to your Mac.  The info you need will be at the top.  You can limit it to just the battery info by tweaking the command as follows:  precodesystem_profiler SPPowerDatatype | grep -i "charge information" -A 10 /code/pre  strongResults:/strong  precodeCharge Information:           Charge Remaining (mAh): 3433           Fully Charged: Yes           Charging: No           Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 3517       Health Information:           Cycle Count: 941           Condition: Service Battery       Battery Installed: Yes       Amperage (mA): 0       Voltage (mV): 12343 /code/pre  (I have a MBP with the exact same symptoms you have).  Here we can see that the battery is in need of service.  The key here is that under "Amperage" we get a "0" which means there is literally no current coming from the battery.    If we unplug the power adapter, the battery has nothing to supply so the computer shuts off.  h2The Fix/h2  You just need a new battery.  I have used this MacBook Air replacement battery previously with excellent results. They offer a 12 month warranty and of the 5 or 6 that I have replaced, not a single one has yet to have a battery problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eJ0HX.png" alt="MBA Replacement Battery"  To replace the battery; it's actually very simple.  Just remove the screws holding the back cover in place.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqiyI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then, just remove the screws holding in the battery and swap.  strongemJust be careful when disconnecting the battery from the logic board./em/strong Don't yank it off, use a spudger or similar tool to disconnect the molex connector by "wedging" it off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pzClk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Reverse the procedure to reassemble.  Make sure you note where each screw comes from as they are different.  That's it.  Your MBA will now be able to hold a charge like it did when new.  <answer258443> Your battery gets not charged properly. This can mean different thinks. Start inspecting all the different components involved.  Try resetting SMC first and only after a SMC reset did not solve your problem you should think about replacing your battery.   The other two answers already explain everything you need to know about each of those steps very well.  But you should also check all the components and connections your current passes through: power adapter, MagSafe connection pins, MagSafe connection at your laptop. If, for example your MagSafe connection is not stable, your SMC could get into trouble: are all the pins ok or is one stuck? This happened to a MacBook Pro we have and as a result we had to buy new Batteries continuously until we found out, that the pins apparently did not have a stable connection. A screwed up SMC could be at the cause of all your troubles and in that case the question is: why did it screw up?  In our case the MBP stopped holding charge and did not charge. A SMC reset + MagSafe cleaning helped in our case, but we will probably have to buy a new power adapter.  When your MagSafe connection works you should get proper feedback from the LED.  ul licheck all the connections, what is the condition of your battery? Is it starting to increase its volume? Do you have a stable power connection at power outlet or at the MagSafe?/li lido a SMC reset./li litry to charge after SMC reset/li lidoes it charge? What does the MagSafe LED say: green, orange, off?/li liin case SMC reset does not solve your problem you should consider a more thoroughly inspection of your battery./li /ul  From experience I can say that a screwed up SMC can put excessive stress on a battery and destroy it in a very short time.  Good luck!  <comment146111> Have a look at **Applications  Utilities  System Profiler**. There, look underneath **Power Supply**, more specifically the info about the battery. What does it says? <comment146125> Please perform a SMC reset: Shut down the computer. Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected. On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time. Release all the keys and the power button at the same time. Press the power button to turn on the computer.   Note: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.
