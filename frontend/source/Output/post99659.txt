Where is a full (complete) list of defaults domains and parameters? <body> I found several long lists with defaults, settings, but never a complete one with a reference to developers.apple.com. Is there any such list to find? If not, which is the longest/systematic/complete list with defaults?  h1Update:/h1  I'm interested more in the system administration point of view on the collection of the defaults settings, rather than in the developing an application  h1Update2:/h1  Interesting could be something like TinkerTool collection in the form of Application, but using only the terminal  h1Update3:/h1  e.g. all defaults keys from codeNSGlobalDomain/code  <answer99662> Here is the list of all defaults parameters that [I think] you are looking for.  Here is the link I got it from.  Looks something like this, but a stronglot/strong longer :) :     NSBundleIdentifier = "com.apple.Stickies"; NSBundlePath =   "/Applications/Stickies.app"; NSKeyEquivalent = { English = Y; default   = Y; };                       NSMenuItem =                     { English = "Make New Sticky Note"; default = "Make Sticky"; };                       NSMessage = makeStickyFromTextService;                       NSPortName = Stickies;                       NSSendTypes =                     ( NSStringPboardType, NSRTFPboardType, NSRTFDPboardType);                       NSUUID = &lt;8d4e24fb c97345b3 89d26400 baabea39;                                               },   h2If The Above Is Not Sufficient/h2  Try searching for what you want here. It is a database of hidden, secret settings for NSGlobalDomain.  <answer99665> I believe this may be what you're looking for.  <comment117250> thanks for the answer and for the remark, but I'm currently interested more in the system administration point of view on the collection of the defaults settings. (updated the post) <comment117252> I'm still not quite sure I understand. [TinkerTool](http://www.bresink.com/osx/300321023/Docs-en/pgs/0240-Standalone.html) does seem to be using only the Terminal. It is called `TinkerTool System Release 2 Standalone Utility` and it seems to be running in Terminal. Is [this](http://www.bresink.com/osx/300321023/Docs-en/pgs/0240-Standalone.html) what you were looking for? <comment117253> didn't found that page before. but I don't see a defaults manipulation there <comment117255> :) this is what I already found and noticed in the post with (many/several lists). But they are only user collection without any references (and there is not so many NSGlobalDomain settings listed). Still thank you very much for trying to help! <comment117256> Well, it was a good exercise for me as well. I have use for a compilation such as this. I think O'Reilly should adapt a Pocket Reference on this subject. (I'd write one myself if I had the time.) <comment117257> hm, I think I saw somewhere a book by O'Reilly "osx for the unix geeks". a good point to search references <comment117258> Static, please take a look at my update and see if it meets your requirements. <comment117259> awesome! :) I think they are still not all (or not all actuall - it's related to 10.7.4) but still its really great collection!
