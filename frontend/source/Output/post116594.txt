Play/Pause buttons - different application? <body> Given the age of this question, and the fact that it's about the remote, I think there's merit in asking this again, and separately:  On a Mac keyboard the kbdF8/kbd key is also a play/pause button. By default, it controls iTunes. I would like to use it to control another program (specifically Vox)  ol liIs this possible?/li liIs it possible emwithout/em third-party software?/li /ol  <answer116598> It's possible, but not without third-party software or scripting.  You can use the Vox preference pane to set this though:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5JT1D.jpg" alt="Vox Preferences"  (go to Vox → Preferences → Controls → Setup)  <comment136380> Very helpful, thank you! Great to get further away from iTunes.
