Where is the Launchpad database stored and is there a way to edit it directly? <body> When exploring the new Launchpad feature, at first, it would seem as is it draws it's content primarily from the Programs folder.  It seems to be the case, however, that the Launchpad database is drawn from somewhere else.   For example, when installing a game through Steam, the game itself will not show up in the Programs folder, but emwill/em show up in Launchpad. In this particular case, I emwant/em it to be in Launchpad. The emdrawbacks/em, however, are that I am unable to remove the game from Launchpad and am unable to change the icon.  strongWhere can I emdirectly/em view and modify emevery/em Launchpad occurrence?/strong  <answer18553> The Launchpad database is located at code~/Library/Application Support/Dock/*some-hex-name*.db/code  To edit it, you'll have to use SQLite. You can do this on the command line, or with a graphic interface.  See this Ask Different question for recommendations for a GUI app.  <answer89801> Apologies for tacking this on to a 2-year old thread, but FWIW the value for emsome-hex-name/em is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.dock.emanother-hex-name/em.plist as "LaunchPadDBName".  It seems like the number itself is not important, and may in fact be random; but, it may probably needs to conform to the UUID format.  Changing this value for a user, then logging in, will result in a new .db being created if it does not already exist.  You can use this to set multiple accounts to use a pre-defined LaunchPad configuration, etc.  "emanother-hex-name/em" is the UUID of the computer  <comment20325> Thanks, this indeed is the location of the database, although not every table is really readable. Apps seem to be primarily stored in the table `apps` and renaming there should probably work. Editing the icons, though, should prove to be a bit harder. <comment331268> Update for 2016: I'm running macOS Sierra 10.12 and there is only one file under my `~/Library/Application Support/Dock` directory called `desktop picture.db`. I can't find the dock database.
