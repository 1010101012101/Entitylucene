Unable to select individual songs to play on iPhone. Songs will only play on shuffle mode <body> Up until today I was able to select and play any of the songs that I downloaded to my iPhone. Then for reasons I am not sure, songs no longer played when I selected them. They are not faded, so I think the songs are still available, they just won't play. I can only play songs if I select the shuffle mode. I have an iPhone SE.
