OpenCV library not installing after using cmake <body> I use Yosemite 10.10, and I need to build and install the OpenCV library using cmake-gui. I was able to configure and generate the binaries readily. But when I try to 'make' the library using the terminal      codesudo make -j4/code in the binaries folder, I get the following error -   precodeBuilding CXX object modules/core/CMakeFiles/opencv_core.dir/src/parallel.cpp.o In file included from /usr/include/os/object.h:27:0,              from /usr/include/dispatch/dispatch.h:48,              from /Users/imecindia/Desktop/Downloaded Libraries/opencv-3.0.0-beta/modules/core/src/parallel.cpp:106: /usr/include/os/base.h:113:20: error: missing binary operator before token "(" #if __has_extension(attribute_overloadable)                 ^ /usr/include/os/base.h:119:54: error: missing binary operator before token "(" #if __has_feature(objc_fixed_enum) || __has_extension(cxx_strong_enums)                                                   ^ [ 45%] Building CXX object modules/core/CMakeFiles/opencv_core.dir/src/pca.cpp.o In file included from /usr/include/dispatch/dispatch.h:51:0,              from /Users/imecindia/Desktop/Downloaded Libraries/opencv-3.0.0-beta/modules/core/src/parallel.cpp:106: /usr/include/dispatch/object.h:325:20: error: missing binary operator before token "(" #if __has_extension(c_generic_selections)                 ^ /usr/include/dispatch/object.h:363:20: error: missing binary operator before token "(" #if __has_extension(c_generic_selections)                 ^ /usr/include/dispatch/object.h:391:20: error: missing binary operator before token "(" #if __has_extension(c_generic_selections)                 ^ /usr/include/dispatch/object.h:423:20: error: missing binary operator before token "(" #if __has_extension(c_generic_selections)                 ^ /usr/include/dispatch/object.h:143:15: error: expected unqualified-id before '^' token typedef void (^dispatch_block_t)(void);            ^ /usr/include/dispatch/object.h:143:15: error: expected ')' before '^' token /usr/include/dispatch/object.h:362:3: error: 'dispatch_block_t' has not been declared dispatch_block_t notification_block); ^ make[2]: *** [modules/core/CMakeFiles/opencv_core.dir/src/parallel.cpp.o] Error 1 make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs.... make[1]: *** [modules/core/CMakeFiles/opencv_core.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2 /code/pre  I get that in multiple places in this particular file,  Also I specified the compiler for using gcc/g++/gfortran that came with MacPorts. It's mandatory that I use the MacPorts compiler btw.  Can someone let me know what I can do?  <answer156985> I'm sorry but I could fix it myself.  In Cmake GUI WITH, I just enabled codeWITH_OPENMP/code.  I'm leaving this question here though just in case someone else faces the same issue later on.  <answer167113> I'll add another answer, piggybacking on yours, but in the case that someone emisn't/em using the cmake gui.  In this case, If you want to enable codeWITH_OPENMP/code look in codeopencv-2.4.10/CMakeLists.txt/code.  Search for codeOpenMP/code and edit this line and change codeOFF/code to codeON/code.  precodeOCV_OPTION(WITH_OPENMP         "Include OpenMP support"                      ON) /code/pre
