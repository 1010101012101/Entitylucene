How to update nodejs on mac? <body> I'm trying to install nodejs on mac using homebrew, but when I run the command:  precodebrew install node /code/pre  I get the following error:  precodeBeginning with 0.8.0, this recipe now comes with npm. It appears you already have npm installed at /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm. To use the npm that comes with this recipe, first uninstall npm with `npm uninstall npm -g`, then run this command again.  If you would like to keep your installation of npm instead of using the one provided with homebrew, install the formula with the `--without-npm` option. /code/pre  but when I run:  precodesudo npm uninstall npm -g /code/pre  I get:  precodesudo: npm: command not found /code/pre  When I run the command codenpm/code, I get:  precode-bash: /usr/local/bin/npm: No such file or directory /code/pre  so I'm not sure whether it's actually installed or not.  My node version is 0.8.22 (I have no idea where it came from). How should I update it to the latest version?  <answer93974> Is code/usr/local/bin/npm/code a broken symlink? That would make codesudo npm/code print an error like codecommand not found/code and codenpm/code print an error like codeNo such file or directory/code.  You could try creating a new symlink for node:  precode$ rm /usr/local/bin/npm; brew unlink node; brew link node Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/node/0.10.5... 4 links removed Linking /usr/local/Cellar/node/0.10.5... 5 symlinks created $ sudo /usr/local/bin/npm uninstall npm -g /code/pre  Or use code/usr/local/opt/node/bin/npm/code:  precode$ ls -l `brew --prefix node` lrwxr-xr-x  1 lauri  admin  21 Jun 14 18:27 /usr/local/opt/node -&gt; ../Cellar/node/0.10.5 $ sudo /usr/local/opt/node/bin/npm uninstall npm -g /code/pre  <comment110170> If you use homebrew just use it and nothing else. I would try to uninstall using brew first. Also did yiu install node via home-brew? <comment138433> If `brew list` shows both node and npm, just delete both and start again? <comment146507> I don't have enough understanding of this [thread on homebrew on how npm became broken](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/27479) when installed, but it might help you with some documented workarounds like the One-line npm install `npm_config_prefix=/usr/local/lib/node_modules; curl -sSL https://npmjs.org/install.sh | bash`
