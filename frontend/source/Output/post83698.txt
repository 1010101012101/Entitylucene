Background shape for paragraph styles in Pages <body> I was wondering if it was possible to achieve this in pages.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/egePW.png" alt="enter image description here"  I would like to have a background shape for a paragraph style (heading 1). Currently I place them manually but it would be much better if they could be set in the style and added automatically.  <comment96709> Don't think so I'm afraid.
