Why do subtitles not work when streaming via AirPlay to Apple TV? <body> Whenever I use AirPlay to watch strongstreamed content/strong (emstreaming from the web/em (via an app or Safari), that is, not from a downloaded movie) from my iPad to my Apple TV, subtitles are never carried over. Why is this? Is there some obscure setting to enable subtitle support in AirPlay/Apple TV?  <answer95781> try Beamer app, it makes subtitle configuration much easier. I never managed to get subtitles on my iTunes - TV via airplay. Beamer made it easy. Well worth the $15  <comment107701> What devices are you streaming from? What format is the video you are playing? What format is the subtitle track? <comment107891> I'm streaming from various official TV channel apps as well as movie rental apps (like Netflix, for example). I have no idea what format the video or subtitles use.
