Show same stuff on external screen as my screen <body> When I'm lecturing I want the exact same stuff that shows on my MacBook Air's screen to show on the external screen. How do I do that?  For just slides the regular settings are fine, but when I'm coding/compiling/debugging live they are a hassle like no other.  (Ps. would like suggestions for better titles/tags in the comments. Or if your rep is high enough just go ahead and modify whatever you'd like.)   <answer63195> You did not specify the OS you are using but in general in the display preferences (System Preferences &rarr; Display) you should look for a strongmirroring/strong option.
