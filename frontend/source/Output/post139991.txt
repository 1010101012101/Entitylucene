Tunnel all traffic over HTTP <body> I often end up in a situation where I connect via public Wi-Fi connection, and it's severely crippled (HTTP only, no SSH, no SMTP).  I want to set up some kind of HTTP tunnel for all traffic in the system (OSX) and bypass the restriction. I have a bunch of Linux boxes on AWS that can host the server-side bit.  What are my options?  <comment164961> I first tried running SSH on port 80. <comment165118> I don't think it's possible. But I would setup server-side terminal web app. So you can have terminal access to all of your servers, at least.
