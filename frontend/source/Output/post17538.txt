Samba is removed from Lion. How is the role of auto_master changed <body> I used to use the /etc/auto_master file to load SMB shares in Snow leopard Mac OS X  Now that Samba is removed, I wonder what should be the correct way to auto mount windows shares.  <answer17551> Mac OS X never used Samba's SMB client. Mac OS X has always used an SMB client implementation based on Boris Popov's codesmbfs/code for FreeBSD. I don't think that's changing in Lion, so its relation to /etc/auto_master probably isn't changing.  As for the SMB server side, Samba is surely being replaced with a different SMB server software package.  <comment19141> Let's wait until it's officially released before asking people to break their word about NDA publicly here. The apple developer forums are a better place to talk about pre-release software. <comment19148> Questions about pre-release software is off-topic per the FAQ. <comment21092> reopen them, dude. they are released software :D <comment21313> It seems to me that the entire setup is better in Lion, but I am still unsure of what the best practise is to map windows shares to Lion.
