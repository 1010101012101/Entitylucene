OS X El Capitan: Change the direction of text <body> I remember I used to change the direction of text using keyboard shortcuts (like codeCommand-Control-Right Arrow/code), but it doesn't work anymore. How can I re-enable it? I found this page about this topic from Apple, but none of these work.  <answer285015> Go the System Prefs/Keyboard/Input Sources/Arabic  (or whatever script you are using) and make sure the box for Enable Keyboard Shortcuts is checked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DSmR9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment359393> What app are you using?
