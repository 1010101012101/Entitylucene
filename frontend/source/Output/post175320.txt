Why is my hostname resolution taking so long? <body> Several months ago I noticed that my text editor (emacs) and IDE (IntelliJ) were taking a really long time to start up. The time appeared to vary based on the DNS servers OS X was using.  I was able to isolate the issue when a project's test suite was running slowly. I found the (higher level) culprit to be a call to codesocket.getfqdn()/code.   Running the following command in the terminal on OS X 10.10.2, demonstrates the problem:  precode$ time python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()' python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'  0.02s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 5.122 total /code/pre  I traced the code that runs when codesocket.getfqdn()/code is called and the delay is caused by codegetaddrinfo(3)/code. I wrote a small program that isolates the problem and codegai_strerror(3)/code provides this message:  precode$ time ./hostinfo Hostname: MacBook-Pro.local getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known ./hostinfo  0.00s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 5.101 total /code/pre  It seems like the delay is waiting for the DNS query to time out. The above results were using Google's public DNS servers. If I use my ISP's DNS servers, however, the time increases to 30 seconds:  precode$ time python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()' python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'  0.01s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 30.114 total /code/pre  (curiously the C program codehostinfo/code still takes just above 5 seconds)  What is causing this issue? Is my hostname invalid or causing problems?  precode$ hostname MacBook-Pro.local /code/pre  This problem doesn't happen on a Macbook Air on the same network.  The major difference I can see is that on the problematic machine, the following DNS confiugration is listed:  precode$ scutil --dns DNS configuration  resolver #1   search domain[0] : Home   nameserver[0] : 8.8.8.8   nameserver[1] : 8.8.4.4   flags    : Request A records   reach    : Reachable  DNS configuration (for scoped queries)  resolver #1   search domain[0] : Home   nameserver[0] : 8.8.8.8   nameserver[1] : 8.8.4.4   if_index : 4 (en0)   flags    : Scoped, Request A records   reach    : Reachable /code/pre  On the Macbook Air, several extra entries are included that relate to mDNS. For example:  precoderesolver #2   domain   : local   options  : mdns   timeout  : 5   flags    : Request A records   order    : 300000 /code/pre  This seems to be significant. Interestingly, the timeout listed above is about the same as the runtimes above.  I should note that I'm connected to the internet using WiFi and the problem only exists when trying to resolve my computer's host name.  <answer175756> I was able to fix this issue by explicitly setting the codeHostName/code using codescutil/code to be the same value as codeLocalHostName/code:  precode$ scutil --set HostName $(scutil --get LocalHostName) /code/pre  Now:  precode$ sudo scutil --set HostName MacBook-Pro $ time python -c 'import socket; print(socket.getfqdn())' MacBook-Pro python -c 'import socket; print(socket.getfqdn())'  0.01s user 0.00s system 86% cpu 0.016 total /code/pre  I was confused before because of the following:  precode$ scutil --get LocalHostName MacBook-Pro  $ hostname MacBook-Pro.local /code/pre  But:  precode$ scutil --get HostName HostName: not set /code/pre  <answer223051> Had the same issue, but your suggestions didn't work for me.  Eventually, I fixed it by doing this once I did this:  precodesudo scutil --set HostName uranus.local /code/pre  My machine host is 'uranus'. I only had to add '.local' to it.  <comment206736> Welcome on board n°67590. Please add in your question how your MBP is connected to the Internet (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth…). Did you try a basic `ping my_ISP_DNS_server` & `ping Google_DNS_server`? <comment324143> As stated in the [other answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/223051/25990) it seems like to fix this not only must it be set but it must contain `.local` as well (or maybe just a `.` in general).
