Re: Windows 7 on BootCamp cannot start upon a fresh installation (OS X 10.10.5) <body> I have followed along with the other questions related to this and have not been able to re-install Windows 7 on my MacBookPro11,3 with Yosemite 10.10.5. I tried the suggestions given in "Windows on BootCamp cannot start upon a fresh installation," but had no luck.   It seems to me (I could be wrong) that the Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621 suggested by David Anderson is only a partial version. I tried first using it alone, and then merging it with the latest version, but it still doesn't work for me.   Has anyone been successful with this, and if so, how did you do it? I've wasted five days on this so far.  <comment247978> In your question, you refer to a "latest version". Which version is that exactly? Also, did you try [version 5.1.5640](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1721?locale=en_US). I suggest Omega try this, but I am still waiting for a reply. Also, is your MacBookPro11,3 the MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) model or the MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) model? Apple has your model listed twice. Please, better describe the error(s) you are currently having. <comment247983> Mine is a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014.) It seems I got the wrong BootCamp downloaded. I got BootCamp 5.1.5621 instead. I'll try 5.1.5640 and report back. <comment247987> It's missing AppleSSD. Which version of BootCamp support do I need to pull it from? <comment247990> Click on the link. (Click on the blue colored text.)
