Graphical Ping Plotter, similar to Perfgraph? <body> On Windows, I use a program called Perfgraph, which, among other things, showed a visual graph of ping latency to various hosts in my Task bar. Here's an example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NMgDq.png" alt="Perfgraph 3.0 from CodeFromThe70s.org"  The ping metric is the graph on the far right.  Does anyone know if something like this is available for OS X? I use it to ping my router and my DNS name server so that I always have a graphical indicator on my connection quality, and if there are problems I know if the source is inside or outside my router.  So far, the only "alternative" is the CLI codeping/code command, which just doesn't present the information in as easily digestible format as Perfgraph.  I don't need all the other functions of Perfgraph, I just want that ping plotter!  Thanks all!  <answer10458> I have a nice CLI solution - it's called mtr. It's installable via homebrew or ports.   Here is a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vv92C.gif" alt="text interface mtr"  <answer87388> codeNagios/code does install with ports on MacOS X.  Have a look at these performance graphs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FSehE.png" alt="enter image description here"  I must quote here the final message of Nagions installer:     But Nagios is a complex program so you should read the documentation online at   http://www.nagios.org or locally at /opt/share/nagios/docs/index.html to fully understand Nagios.   <answer104645> Some time ago I wrote small app called Lagometer which shows ping to selected host (you can set it in preferences) as a graph in menubar. It works only with one host, but should work for you.  <comment11030> Thanks, though not as graphical/colorful as I'm looking for. It really helps when you can see at a glance when something is above normal range just by seeing graph spikes, or color coding. Try to determine variation in a list of black on white numbers is (for me) not very efficient. <comment102579> thanks daniel, i will take a look at this. i've been interested in playing with nagios for a while now. <comment102596> â†’ Ian, I also started testing `SmokePing`: http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/ and I'll add this answer if it's as rock solid as other tools from Tobias. <comment123156> Thanks! Some time ago I actually tried that, but at the time it just showed a colored dot icon. Looks better now. :)
