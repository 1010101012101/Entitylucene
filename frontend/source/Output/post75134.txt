Does the iPad 3/4 charger use a standard C7/C8 interface? <body> The new iPad chargers are sort of a brick containing the transformer, with a detachable corner piece containing the appropriate mains plug for wherever you bought it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tSI1r.jpg" alt="An iPad 4 charger with corner detached lying on its side"  The corner piece looks like it connects to the brick with a standard unpolarized C7 socket / C8 plug:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fPogq.jpg" alt="A standard C8 plug."  I'm going from Europe to America and don't have an official bit to swap in on the charger, but I have a dozen C8 mains cables from other electronics. Can I just use one of them?  <answer75172> I happen to have a C8 plug from my PS Vita charger, and my iPad (3rd gen) charger here.  I plugged them into each other, and plugged in my iPhone.  Sure enough, it started charging my phone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T7KJv.png" alt="picture showing c8 plugged in to ipad charger"  So yes, this does work fine.  C8 plugs will plug into the iPad 3 chargers.
