Opening Chrome icon flashes up then disappears <body> A friend has just downloaded and installed Chrome for Mac OS (current version 51).  When they click to open Chrome the icon appears briefly in the dock, then disappears and Chrome closes.  The behavior is replicated if you try to launch Chrome form the command line using  precode/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome /code/pre  They get an error  precodeFailed to create /Users/NAME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/SingletonLock /code/pre  If they run with codesudo/code they are able to start Chrome.  precodesudo /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome /code/pre  How can we fix this? We've tried reinstalling Chrome and the problem persists.  <answer250346> We fixed this by deleting the lock file in code~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/SingletonLock/code and everything else in the profile running  precoderm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome /code/pre  Seems related to the Chrome is not opening on the Google Chrome Help forum.  <comment310817> Welcome to Ask Different.
