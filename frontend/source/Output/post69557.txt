What is the Apple / OS X name for "Alternate Data Streams"? <body> On old Macs before OS X files already could have two "forks" - a data fork and a resource fork.  According to Wikipedia, at some point the HFS+ filesystem of OS X gained the ability to have an arbitrary number of forks, much like Microsofts "Alternate Data Streams" (codeADS/code).     HFS Plus permits filenames up to 255 UTF-16 characters in length, and n-forked files similar to NTFS, though until recently, almost no systems software takes advantage of forks other than the data fork and resource fork.   I want to know what the official term is for these forks or streams. I guess it's possible they're just called "forks" but that term has several meanings already in computing. I've done some searching but can't find a definitive answer.  <answer69561> Apple uses "multiple fork" or the shortened form "multi-fork" consistently through its documentation, so it seems it is the official term. I list here a few examples:  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/General/Conceptual/SLGlobalGlossary/Glossary/Glossary.html (Last updated: 2010-07-09)     HFS+  Hierarchical File System Plus. The Mac OS Extended file-system   format. This format adds support for filenames longer than 31   characters, Unicode representation of file and directory names, and   efficient operation on very large disks. strongHFS+ is a multiple-fork   volume format./strong   https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/io_porting/io_porting.html (Last updated: 2012-06-11)     (...) some Mac applications also take advantage of the HFS+ file   systemâ€™s ability to handle strongmulti-forked files/strong.   https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/AboutBundles/AboutBundles.html (Last updated: 2010-07-08)     Bundles can reside on volumes of many different formats, including   strongmultiple fork/strong formats like HFS, HFS+, and AFP, and single-fork formats   like UFS, SMB, and NFS.   When talking about "fork" in computing I can only think of either HFS+/HFS forks or the system call for creating a child process.  <answer241980> I've just become interested in this topic again and started poking around.  This time I've noticed that the term strong"named fork"/strong is widely used for forks other than the data fork and resource fork.  I'll provide some links when I find the best ones ...  <comment80809> What a great answer - thanks for your effort! (-: <comment80810> You're welcome! <comment80811> Yes there is forking child processes and also forking projects, especially open source projects, as happened to OpenOffice-LibreOffice and WikiTravel-WikiVoyage. There may be other uses I don't know of too... <comment80822> Oh God, I forgot fork in software development, thanks for pointing that out.
