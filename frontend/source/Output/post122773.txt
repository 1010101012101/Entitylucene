keyboard shortcut to jump to the non-whitespace first character in a line <body> kbdcontrol/kbd-kbda/kbd is pretty close - it moves the character to the first column. kbdcommand/kbd-kbdleft/kbd does too.  if my keyboard had a kbdhome/kbd key this would likely move the cursor there, but it doesn't.  similar to this question, i'm trying to get vim's kbd^/kbd behaviour without moving my hands too far. unfortunately kbdalt/kbd-kbdm/kbd outputs Âµ instead of giving me the goods.  i'm hoping for something i can use system wide, i'm not sure if os x has this though.   <answer122863> There is no shortcut for it by default. As a hack, you can create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{   "~m" = (moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, insertText:, " ", moveLeft:, selectWord:,    moveRight:, setMark:, moveToBeginningOfParagraph:, deleteForward:,    swapWithMark:, moveLeft:); } /code/pre  Then quit and reopen applications to apply the changes. code~m/code is option-m, which is bound to codeback-to-indentation/code in Emacs.  I copied the macro from https://github.com/ttscoff/KeyBindings/blob/master/DefaultKeyBinding.dict. codemoveToBeginningOfParagraph:, selectWord:, moveRight:/code would not work with lines that don't start with spaces or tabs. codemoveToBeginningOfParagraph:,moveWordRight:, moveWordLeft:/code would not work with some lines where the first non-whitespace character is a special character.  DefaultKeyBinding.dict does not work with some applications like Xcode or Firefox.
