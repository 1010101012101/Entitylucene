Can I still set my account picture to an image from disk in OS X Mountain Lion? <body> I can't seem to browse my hard disk for a custom image to use as my account picture anymore since installing OS X Mountain Lion.  The new popover shows that I can now only choose from the default set of pictures, pick something I've recently used, or take a new one with my Mac's iSight camera:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jtoe9.png" alt=""  sup(I have no real inclination towards golf.)/sup  There was always a Choose button in the panel dialog in previous versions of OS X, but now it's gone. Is there no way to browse my disk for a custom image anymore on Mountain Lion, or is there hopefully a codedefaults/code switch somewhere that I need to flip to enable it again?  <answer60731> You can drag in any picture from the Finder into the Preference Pane to change the custom image. Not as convenient as using the Open Dialog though...  <comment69932> Strange why I hadn't thought of that â€” I'd just done exactly the same thing an hour ago, except with a login item. Thanks! <comment70812> Good to know... I just switched from the Windows world a couple of weeks ago and there are little things like that that throw me off at times.  I'd say I strongly prefer the Open/Save dialog on Windows though (for everything). The one in Finder has a few shortcomings in comparison. <comment336867> I've been using OS X for 5+ years now and I still trip over these "intuitive" interfaces pretty frequently.
