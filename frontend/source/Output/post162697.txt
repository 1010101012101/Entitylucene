What adapter(s) do I need to connect a Retina MacBook Pro Thunderbolt output to a 2560x1440 NEC monitor? <body> I've got a 13" Retina MacBook Pro and an NEC PA241W 2560x1440 monitor.  What adapters do I need to connect them at full resolution?  <answer162700> Mini Display Port to Display Port.  http://www.colorwiki.com/wiki/NEC_PA241W_Review#VIDEO_CONNECTIONS  Thunderbolt is in effect Display Port plus more functionality.  <answer162703> Just get a Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter.  From there, use a DVI cable to connect to the monitor.  <comment190278> why? When the MBP has Thunderbolt/mini DP already & the monitor has DP already. What's the point of paying 30 bucks for an adapter plus however much for a cable when all you need is a cable? <comment190280> I was not aware it had a DP connection.  99% of the monitors out there have VGA/DVI inputs, and a number of them contain HDMI inputs as well.  Also, Eric doesn't mention if he already has a DP cable or a DVI cable.  If he has a DVI cable, my solution works.  If he has a DP cable, your solution works.  That said, was a downvote truly necessary? <comment190286> I don't want to get into any argument over it. I did some research, posted my answer, you didn't, & posted a more expensive answer; hence my downvote. The monitor ships with 3 cables - http://www.necdisplay.com/p/desktop-monitors/pa241w-bk?type=support <comment190304> Thanks very much!  My monitor does in fact have a displayport input, so it looks like the mini DP to DP solution will be less expensive than mini DP to DVI.  And thank you for explaining that a thunderbolt output is just mini DP enhanced.  That's very useful. <comment190306> BTW, I would have voted you both up, but I'm brand new on this site and I need 15 reputation to vote up!!  Thanks again. <comment192142> No worries, best of luck.  If I may suggest, check into an SSD.  I had a 2010 13" MBP where I removed the optical drive, put the original 250GB rotating drive in it's place via a kit, and installed an SSD for the main boot volume.  Once you enjoy 14-second boot times, you'll wonder how you ever survived without it.  Here's the kit:  http://bit.ly/1bo3X72
