Why can't I type 'e' in terminal? <body> It beeps when typing the lower case of e .Tried to change the VT100 mode, still doesn't work.  <comment197188> Are you using the built-in terminal app, or a third-party terminal? <comment197201> What keyboard layout are you using? <comment197211> @jer-el it's just a built-in terminal. <comment197212> @IanC. It's the Mac Pro keyboard <comment197214> Yea, but what layout/language? `System Preferences  Keyboard  Input Sources` -- what language and layout are you using? Is `e` mapped to something else? <comment197325> @IanC. It's U.S. NO I've already deleted every shortcut related. With     'bind -p'      I can see      '"e": self-insert'       was missing <comment197477> My email is emanonzhou@gmail.com    anyone would like to help me there? Thank you so much! <comment197794> Wow, it heals itself! I don't think I did anything but it's acting normal now. Thank God!
