Can I transfer my TextMate 2 settings to another Mac? <body> I am switching to a new Mac and want to bring my TextMate 2 settings with me from my old Mac. I don't see an obvious way to do this, and searching hasn't brought anything up. Do I really need to re-set everything up again from scratch?  Or is there a way to export/copy TextMate 2 preferences/settings from one computer to another?  Thanks!  <answer215548> TextMate 2, which is still in Beta, places its Preferences Settings in code/Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.macromates.TextMate.preview.plist/code although I suspect that "empreview/em" will be dropped from the filename once it goes gold. Copying this file to a different User/System should, to the proper location, transfer the Preferences Settings.  <answer215555> I've managed to get pretty far on my own, so I'm posting an answer.  If someone else has a better way, I'll be glad to accept their answer.  I ran into some gotchas along the way, so I wanted to share those as well.  Here are the steps I took.  ol liMake sure TextMate is not running on your new Mac./li liOn your old Mac, tar up the TextMate and Avian folders under ~/Library/Application Support:/li /ol  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"code$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support $ tar cfz TextMate.tgz TextMate $ tar cfz Avian.tgz Avian /code/pre  (You may or may not have the Avian directory.  If not, skip instructions related to that.)  ol start="3" liCopy those two tar files to your new Mac and place them under ~/Library/Application Support, and then extract them:/li /ol  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"code$ cp TextMate.tgz ~/Library/Application\ Support $ cp Avian.tgz ~/Library/Application\ Support $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support $ tar xfz TextMate.tgz $ tar xfz Avian.tgz  /code/pre  ol start="4" liCopy the TextMate .plist files from ~/Library/Preferences on your old Mac over to the same locations on your new Mac.  For me this was the following two files:/li /ol  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"code$ cd ~/Library/Preferences $ ls | grep -i textmate com.macromates.TextMate.preview.LSSharedFileList.plist com.macromates.TextMate.preview.plist $ /code/pre  ol start="5" li(Here is the 'gotcha' which took me awhile to figure out.)  You need to emunquarantine/em the files you just copied over to your new Mac.  Do this (on your new Mac) by clearing the extended attribute codecom.apple.quarantine/code as follows:/li /ol  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"code$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support $ xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine Avian $ xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine TextMate $ cd ~/Library/Preferences $ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine com.macromates.TextMate.* /code/pre  The code-r/code and code-d/code options to codexattr/code say to handle all files in those directories (recursive) and delete the attribute specified.  If you get a bunch of permission errors, place codesudo/code in front of the xattr commands.  The above appears to have restored the majority of the TextMate "behaviors" from my old Mac to my new Mac.  I still had to open up the TextMate - Preferences menu and do a side-by-side comparison, checking and unchecking boxes for various settings that did not transfer over with the above steps.  emUpdate:/em  If you have a .tm_properties file, e.g., code~/.tm_properties/code, you'll also want to copy that over to your new Mac.  <comment260359> If there is a specific `.ini` file in the `~/.config` folder you can copy from a pc to the other.  `.ini` file contains all the setting of an application. <comment260365> @Mattia: thanks, but this is on a Mac. <comment260366> Yes, I was referring to a Mac pc!! ;-) <comment260367> More precisely, if you are able to find a file called: `texmate.ini` or something like that you can copy it and use again in the other Mac Pc. <comment260370> @Mattia, Have you been using a Mac for long?  `.ini`  files are typically used under Windows **not** OS X! Under OS X most normal settings are stored in `.plist` files. <comment260373> @user3439894 I did what I suggested once but with an other application. I don't know if this is possible in this particular case. ;-) <comment260375> @Mattia, If you're not positive of something then please do not post unveted information as it only serves to confuse rather then to provide valid help. <comment260385> @user3439894 I just wrote a comment not an answer!!!!
