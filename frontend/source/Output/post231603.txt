Can I use the battery from an early 2014 MacBook Air in a mid 2012 Air? <body> I just bought a used mid-2012 MacBook Air to replace the early-2014 model my dog killed but the battery life is terrible comparatively.   Can I take the battery out of the 2014 and use it in the 2012 safely?  <answer238134> The short answer is strongYES/strong  Apple is going to use different part numbers but essentially they are the same battery.  The easiest way to see if the batteries are interchangeable is to take a look at the aftermarket battery replacement.  For example, this particular battery made by GreenBox Innovations and found on Amazon fits Macbook Air Models from Late 2010 through Early 2014  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nxisk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment282834> Have a go hopefully it should work. <comment282835> @RACING121 Yeah, it's worth a try. Apple products are funny about stuff like that. One I was repairing a CDMA iPhone 4 by replacing the dock connector, but the place where I bought replacement parts sold me a dock connector for an iPhone 4s by mistake. Surprisingly, though it didn't fit inside the phone right, it worked just fine. However, I don't know how it worked in the long run, because the seller switched out the part for a proper one. Anyways, that battery shouldn't harm you or your MacBook, but you can compare the specs of them anyways. <comment282836> @RedEagle2000 Apple... ;) <comment282838> I'd contact Apple to be sure however from what I looked at on the Internet at several sites that offer parts and in particular the battery they are not the same between those years.
