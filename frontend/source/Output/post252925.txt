Siri suggestion still showing after turned off <body> I had install iOS10 and i don't like siri suggested app, so i had turn it off according to this, but it didn't work. It still shows on notification center.  I tried restarting it as well but nothing. Is there any other way around?  <answer252934> On the Notification screen, scroll to the bottom and tap codeEdit/code.  On the list of apps, tap the red circle next to codeSiri App Suggestions/code, then tap codeRemove/code.  On the top right of the screen, tap codeDone/code.   This should remove Siri App Suggestions from Notification screen immediately, no need to reboot.
