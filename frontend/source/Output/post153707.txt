Lit./ Humanities Student asks Evernote Vs. Onenote and Macs and tablets or kindle <body> I'd like to be able to extract text from a pdf into a new note file on one note or evernote so I can organize myself on themes, as well as change the font of the text.  Do these tools allow that function? If not, what iOS apps do?  <comment180925> Welcome to the Stack Exchange network. We have some guidelines in the [help] section as well as in [meta] to ask recommendation questions that are useful to the scope of the internet. In short, focus more on the tasks you need to accomplish and not on who or what "class" of people are using it since Lit/Humanities students could be 80 years old and software engineers or they could be 18 years old without any formal training elsewhere. <comment180926> Also, one question per question is best. I've isolated one decent recommendation and look at http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2180/how-should-i-ask-about-getting-a-software-recommendation if you want to edit this or ask follow on recommendation questions.
