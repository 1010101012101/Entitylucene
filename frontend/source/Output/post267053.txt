I need to transfer videos from my iPhone 6 to my Mac <body> I want to be able to transfer some videos from my iPhone to my Mac so that I can create a YouTube video. The problem is that I can't insert a cable into my Mac because it only has inserts for a charger and headphones. Is there any way I can email or use Dropbox to get the pictures and videos into my Mac?  <answer267073> Based on your description I assume that you're talking about MacBook what only has only one USB-C port.  For transferring media from your iPhone to your MacBook you have multiple options:  ul liUse AirDrop/li liUse Lighting to USB-C cable/li liUse iCloud or any other cloud provider (Dropbox, Google Drive or Dropbox)/li /ul  <comment334996> Have you tried Airdrop? <comment334999> To be able to help you, it'd be good to know your exact model of Mac and what OS you have installed?
