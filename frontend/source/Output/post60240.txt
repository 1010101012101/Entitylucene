Safari won't open after Lion? <body> I just finished upgrading to Lion from SL and Safari won't open. When I click it, the app bounces in the dock for a moment then a box pops up and says  strongcodeSafari quit unexpectedly./code/strong  precodeClick Reopen to open the application again. Click Report to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple. /code/pre  I tried going to the apple website to download safari but http://www.apple.com/safari/ doesn't contain a download link on the page (to me, at least) and http://www.apple.com/safari/download just redirects to http://www.apple.com/safari/.  I can't find a Safari version for Lion anywhere.  <answer60311> Found this pkg to Safari 6:   http://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/37/23/041-5058/lr5tynbldi18zcrqo8a8uq88 rnjushqliu/Safari6Lion.pkg  <answer60381> You need to delete the  two Webkit folders under system folder. Then run updates and all will be well  <answer96795> I had this exact issue and error and was able to fix it. To be specific to the previous answer of what to delete:  Open finder and navigate to /System/Library/StagedFrameworks/Safari  Delete the two WebKit folders located in the Safari folder:  ul li./WebKit.framework/li li./WebKit2.framework/li /ul  Run Software Update and reinstall Safari when prompted.  I have the same problem with Java (before and after the reinstall) so off to fix that now.   <comment69364> Is there anything "interesting" in `/var/log/system.log` (or in Console.app)? <comment69365> 8/10/12 1:13:58.069 AM ReportCrash: Saved crash report for Safari[26717] version 5.1 (7534.48.3) to /Users/jack/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Safari_2012-08-10-011358_jackss-MacBook.crash <comment69366> I'm not sure what is interesting, should I post the full report, its pretty long. <comment69367> I found this in the report `Application Specific Information: objc[26717]: garbage collection is OFF *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Invalid parameter not satisfying: (index = 0) && (index  [_itemArray count])'` <comment69368> From the crash report only the first approx 30 lines are interesting. Did you look at `system.log` as well (search for the time stamp of the crash (01:13 - 01:14 probably)) <comment69369> Any plugins/extensions installed? <comment69370> @patrix, nope. Is there a mirror to Safari 6 somewhere? <comment70342> Can you please add a bit more details? Which specific folders should get deleted, which updates should be run afterwards? <comment71311> That's as specific as is possible other than doing it for you myself.  Ring apple, it'll take 5 mins to fix. <comment71320> the idea of this site to document answers in a way which allows others to use the answer to resolve similar issues in the future. If I have to do the research again there isn't very much value in the answer in the first place.
