It's not displayed in updates section...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2iOk9.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFGSa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253714>    Did you look in your applications folder? Usually it downloads there. If you open your strongApplications folder/strong there's an app called strongInstall macOS Sierra/strong   Found at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/53qqnp/macos_sierra_downloaded_but_not_installed/  <answer253715> After downloading macOS Sierra it doesn't appear in the Updates section of the App Store app. Instead it is downloaded to your disk and usually can be found in /Applications. If you have downloaded a public beta or a developer beta and moved it to a different folder previously, it may reside there instead.  Depending on your system language the name is emInstall macOS Sierra/em (English) or a name translated to your language accordingly.  <answer253716> It's in the applications folder  <answer254103> Yes I had the same issue go to applications and click the file that was downloaed. It is working now as in the past it froze on me.  <answer254195> or just do a spotlight search for sierra  <comment315835> @grgarside Wasn't aware that quoting was 'illegal' :) Thanks though! edit: oh, now I notice: you prettified it for all of us.

Not quite sure what the previous commenter found wrong with the answer. <comment363259> If you have moved it to another folder it will be updated there if you choose to download it from the App Store again. It will not be downloaded to the /Applications folder a second time.  I usually move my OS X installers to another disk and I have encountered this several times.
