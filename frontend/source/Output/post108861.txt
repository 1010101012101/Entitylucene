Can OS X dump cores in the working directory instead of /cores? <body> I don't know when it started, but at some point, OS X started dumping cores into a special folder (code/cores/code). This is a pain since they get jumbled together and it's hard to keep track of which core files goes with which execution. Is there an environment variable or special flag I can set to have cores dumped into the working directory (as with other operating systems) instead?  <answer124080> I finally figured this out. It turns out that this is a kernel parameter controlled by codesysctl/code. You can set this on a per shell basis to dump in the current working directory with:  precodesysctl -w kern.corefile=core.%P /code/pre  Since I never wanted my core dumps to end up in code/cores/code, but always in the current directory, I added this codeplist/code to code/Library/LaunchDaemons//code:  precode&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;sysctl&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/sbin/sysctl&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-w&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;kern.corefile=core.%P&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  strongUPDATE:/strong  Since I wrote this, it looks like the codesysctl/code command changed. I've updated the examples above, but if you were previously using codekern.core_pattern/code, that doesn't work anymore.  <comment144892> I'm actually not that concerned about stopping the dumps. That's relatively straightforward and easy information to find. The real question I was targeting here was the location change. I did find the answer, but it's longer than a mobile post. I'll put it up soon. <comment144894> You can stop the cores in several ways: - delete the /cores directory - set `ulimit -c 0` or limit core file size to some value that's small enough that you don't mind small dumps <comment144895> I thought OSX always dumped to /cores so I assumed you had none previously.  We can host the "how to stop them entirely" answer on a different question. <comment145014> This changed at some point. Either Lion or Mountain Lion I think, I don't remember. Previously, it behaved like every other OS and dumped them in the current working directory.
