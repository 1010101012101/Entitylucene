Does DevonThink Pro Office support the Macbook Pro Retina display? <body> I'm considering getting a Macbook Pro with retina display, but I can't seem to figure out if DevonThink Pro Office, which I use for my research, will support the retina display. Since it is a program which primarily processes text I will be very disappointed if it doesn't display properly.  <answer94524> The manual, on page 9, states that retina graphics were added in version 2.5 (the current version is 2.5.2). So you should be ok.
