Where's launchd.conf gone in Mountain Lion? <body> Or is this page outdated? As codeman launchd.conf/code still shows the man file as before.  <comment86364> What makes you think the page is in error? Many daemons ship with no configuration file and let the user create them on demand if and when you need them. Without access to the source and checking, we can't really tell if the man page is out of date or the code to support reading those files still exists.
