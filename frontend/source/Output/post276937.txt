Issues with getting iTunes Media folder into iTunes after clean install <body> I've recently done an upgrade form OSX to 10.8 to 10.10. I did a clean install and then copied over my various documents, photos, and iTunes folders. All applications where manually re-installed.   I'm having an issue with getting my music folders to show up in iTunes. In iTunes preferences I have set it up like this (see screenshot below). I have also tried this with the folder location at codeUsers/Max/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/code (with music added at the end).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DDLD6.png" alt="itunes preferences screenshot"  When I look at my folder tree its like this (see below screenshot).   Any ideas where I have gone wrong here ?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/chYrO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment348667> Did you try `Users/Max/Music/iTunes` instead? Mine is on another drive, so it lists the volume too, `/Volumes/drive name/iTunes_Remote` but doesn't go any deeper than that first level. Also, my library xml & itl files are in their standard location. Launching iTunes whilst holding Alt should make it ask where that is.
