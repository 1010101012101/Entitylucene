Cant see MacBook in Windows Network <body> I'm trying to access my MacBook from a Windows PC over the network. The computer is connected to the router, the MacBook is connected to a WAP, which is connected to a switch, which is connected to the router.  When I click on Network on the PC, the MacBook doesn't show up. It has done previously. Sometimes the Windows computer shows in the Finder sidebar and sometimes it doesn't.  How can I make the MacBook show in Network [Places] on the Windows machine? And how do I make the Windows machine stay in the Finder sidebar?  <answer37230> In my experience there is no quickfix way to get windows and mac machines to emalways/em be visible in the others networks list.   The best thing you can do is enable Samba filesharing on your mac, then when you want to connect you just type codesmb:\\Jonathan's MacBook Pro/code (minus the quotes) into the address bar in Explorer (or into the run dialogue).  strongTo Enable SMB sharing on your Mac:/strong  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences  Sharing  File Sharing/strong/li liSelect strongOptions/strong /li liTick strongShare files and folders using SMB (Windows)/strong/li /ol  This has always worked for me with networking windows machines in Mac environments.   <answer40701> Another issue is you might not be in the same workgroup. To fix this go to   System Preferences - Network - Advanced - WINS:  Make sure his Windows box is set the same. What OrangeBox suggested must be done as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ukg8k.png" alt="workgroup setting"
