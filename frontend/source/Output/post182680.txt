My iPhone front camera won't work (it freezes) <body> I dropped my phone in the water and everything works, except my front facing camera. When I go to change from back to front, it freezes and won't let me go back to the back camera, and it's blurry.  <answer284607> Deleted Pinterest, suddenly works for me  <comment217594> Guess you better take it to the store and get a new one. <comment217595> You are a good candidate for Apple Store to get some repairs done, since there is nothing we can do for you. <comment218040> Take it to the nearest apple service center and replace it.. You dont have any other option.. <comment358903> Welcome to Ask Different.  Please see [answer] for tips on providing a good answer.
