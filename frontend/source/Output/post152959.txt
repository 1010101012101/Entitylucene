Is there open source or free software to use my touchpad as absolute touch? <body> I'm running OS X Yosemite, and don't want to spend money on a Wacom tablet. Is there free software or code that can disable the acceleration of the touchpad so I can write effectively with a stylus?  <answer152964> I just found a app called Inklet.  I did not try it my self, but will consider it for any pen drawing work where the use of mouse or trackpad is difficult.  It does cost $20, but it might be worth, but there is a free demo version to try first.  <comment180093> I know you said free, but is $20 to much ? <comment180095> No. If the software is good enough, $30 is a max.
