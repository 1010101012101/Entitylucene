Command line utility to create screenshot <body> Is there some command line utility to create a screenshot of the my screen and store it as png? (Preferably one in the system, without need to install anything new)  <answer28850> It sounds like you're looking for the command codescreencapture/code, which, according to its codeman/code page, is to "capture images from the screen and save them to a file or the clipboard".  It's been a standard part of OS X since 10.2.  <comment33149> Thank you very much! Exactly what I was looking for. <comment33151> May I ask why you need a command line utility instead of using the godly shortcuts for taking screen shots in OS X? <comment33162> @XAleXOwnZX: I'd like to automate the process. I want to have screenshot per minute for 'screenshot journal'. (Like TimeSnapper, but on Mac). <comment33164> in which case you can make an automator script that presses the keys <comment33206> @XAleXOwnZX: pressing the keys may interfere with my work. Simple shell script works great (https://gist.github.com/1306977), and I've added resizing to smaller image to save some space (using ImageMagick).
