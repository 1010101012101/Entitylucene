Are there any keyboard shortcuts to switch between tabs in terminal?  <body> Are there any keyboard shortcuts to switch between tabs in terminal?   <answer37746> Select Next Tab: kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd}/kbd (selects the tab to the right of your current tab)  Select Previous Tab: kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd{/kbd  (select the tab to the left of your current tab)  These are the shortcuts listed under the Window menu, but I think it would make more sense to say kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd]/kbd, since that's actually what you type.  Since there are menu items that these shortcuts trigger, you can use codeSystem Preferences-&gt; Keyboard-&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts-&gt; Application Shortcuts/code (or codeApp Shortcuts/code on newer OSX versions) to reassign the shortcuts to whatever you want. For codeTerminal/code, choose codeOther.../code, then, under codeApplications/code, go to codeUtilities -&gt; Terminal.app/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U98cT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer148716> kbd&#x2318;/kbd + kbd&#x21E7;/kbd + arrow keys is also a valid option.  Enjoy!  <answer196047> If you want to choose your own shortcut for switching tabs in terminal:  codeopen /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Keyboard.prefPane//code  Application Shortcuts  (Add)  Application (Other...)  Applications/Utilities/Terminal  Menu titles:  precodeSelect Next Tab Select Previous Tab /code/pre  I've chosen, for example, kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdALT/kbd+kbd&#x21E6;/kbd and kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdALT/kbd+kbd&#x21E8;/kbd.  <comment42829> On a German keyboard the combos are: CMD+Ä and CMD+Ö (yes, with the 'Umlaute') :) <comment42830> I'm curious, are those located just above and to the left of the right shift key? <comment42831> Diagonal to the top left. So I guess it's the same location! <comment111694> Defaults seem so foreign (but I'm not a heavy mac user...), Chrome and my text editor use Meta + Alt + Arrows to flip through tabs, but Terminal.app is a special snowflake I guess. <comment175157> Not sure why this was voted down. Works for me. <comment175180> no source, no reference, bit short on explaining ect.. <comment177052> From the screenshot, to modify the Terminal app, the Application should be Terminal.app (under Applications  Utilities). <comment182028> Doesn't work for me on Mavericks. <comment190691> Works great for me on Yosemite. This is a far better answer for people with non-english keyboards where the braces are hard to type. <comment195235> Works for me on Yosemite as well. You can use Command + arrows to switch terminal windows and add shift to switch tabs inside the window. <comment270354> As of OS X El Capitan, the Menu Title is now **`Show`** Next Tab. <comment286348> Is `Select Next Tab` a reserved command on Mac?  I mean, I don't get how the OS will understand this. <comment292819> Yea, this is what I would like to set my Terminal shortcut to be too since every other application with tabs uses this. But it doesn't work when I add it in shortcuts.... How does mac know what command to do? <comment292822> If a new OS X version has changed the `Terminal` app menu item titles, then change it accordingly. <comment350572> If you have attached an external keyboard the shortcut can not be registered.
