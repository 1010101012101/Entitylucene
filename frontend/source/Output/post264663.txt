Shutdown "no tty present and no askpass program specified"? <body> I'm trying to run a shutdown script remotely on multiple Macs. The command I use to start it over ssh is:  precodessh ADMIN@mac123 'bash -s' sudo &lt; ./documents/ShutdownUPTIME.sh /code/pre  Of course it asks me for an sudo password, which I type in correctly. The only message after that is: codesudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified/code  Any ideas how I can fix this? My user is definitely a super-user  <answer264667> The error message appears when you try to run a command inside your bash call with codesudo/code and, although the user codeADMIN/code on the destination system codemac123/code has permissions to run commands with codesudo/code, the option codeNOPASSWD/code is not specified for this particular user (in code/etc/sudoers/code).  System would have to prompt user and wait for the password to be provided from the keyboard, however as no terminal is attached, the prompt would hang forever.  As a measure against such situation, system fails with the error message you got.  hr  If you took time to understand my yesterday's answer:     provided ADMIN has strongpasswordless/strong sudo permissions for shutdown or all commands on macxxx machine)   You wouldn't run into this problem.  You should modify your script:  precode... if [ $DAYS_UP -ge ${MAX_UPDAYS} ];then     echo Mac is going to shutdown      sudo shutdown -h now else ... /code/pre  And edit the sudoers file on codemac123/code, so that it contains, for example (it must match the command in the script):  precodeADMIN ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown -h now /code/pre  Bear in mind that you strongmust do it using codevisudo/code/strong program, otherwise you will likely break your system completely.  hr  Alternatively you can use codeSUDO_ASKPASS/code environment variable and point it to a script providing the password (the second part of the error message). I do not recommend this method.
