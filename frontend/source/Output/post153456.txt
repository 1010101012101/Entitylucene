Black screen when open Time Machine on Yosemite <body> I use a 13 Macbook with a thunderbolt display on Yosemite. Since the installation of last osx version, if I try to open Time Machine I can only see a completely black screen on laptop screen. The other screen remains with previously opened windows. So, time machine is completely unusable. I can only use ESC to exit.  Any ideas of what can be happening here?  If I don't connect my second monitor, works fine.  This is my displays configuration: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxN3S.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181465> If you have this issue using Yosemite, i found a turn around:  ol liGo to Preferences - Mission Control/li liUncheck "Displays have separate Spaces"/li lilogout and login/li /ol  This will fix Time Machine to display black screen in one monitor. The side effect of this is you loose the abilitty to use monitors as separate spaces but isn't that bad.  <answer191715> Yes, happens identically to me. As the second monitor is operational try ESC (if not, hold the off button for three seconds, the option menu will appear on your second menu, click sleep then space bar to exit sleep and primary monitor will return). Now switch off and unplug the secondary monitor, try again, voila, all (should) works fine.  <answer197649> Unplugging my second display 'solved' the issue. Not ideal, but an adequate solution for me to get into Time Machine quickly on the odd occasion.   <answer255279> Running OS X Yosemite on a Mac mini and simply hitting the off button on the secondary screen worked just fine.  No need to unplug or logoff.  <comment180596> and it works without thunderbolt screen? and what are your settings in display ? <comment180599> Without the second display attacked, works fine. I updated the question. You can see my displays settings there. <comment180610> Great, thank you, just one more, does it work with other apps (excluding TM) this is to narrow it down to TM or not. <comment180611> Yep, all works fine. The only issue is TM app. <comment225517> What also might fix the issue is opening Mission Control and close the extra desktops (hit the x icon in the corners). Then open Time Machine and the interface should display. <comment257681> Unplugging my second display (Thunderbolt) immediately fixed the issue for me as well. <comment313610> It is amazing how Apple don't give a crap to a 5 years old bug!
