Trackpad gets stuck in select mode <body> I'm experiencing the problems  described here, basically the trackpad has spurts of spurious input, but the problems are fairly intermittent.  I've kept the system usable by deactivating many non-critical gestures, like zooming, three finger drag, etc.   Are there any visualization or tuning tools for the Mac Book Air's trackpad?  It'd be useful to simply get a graphical record of the trackpad's input over a period when it was miss-behaving.  Are there any such tools under Linux if not under Mac OS X?   <answer49680> To be able to see what your trackpad "sees", you can use FingerMgmt.   As for your problem, do you have tap-to-click on? If so, does turning it off solve the problem?  <comment56871> I'm trying that now since finding the thread I linked.  An Apple tech suggested switching hands and resting one on one side of the case, suggested there is a ground connecter there that occasionally comes loose.  Thanks! <comment56888> Interestingly, FingerMgmt has ocasional crashes when running under the Trackpad, but not under Magic Mouse.  If it's actually related, maybe that'll give some information.  Thanks again!
