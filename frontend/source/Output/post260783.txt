mail application - not working <body> when trying to open mail.app it doesn't open, it says 'Application not responding'. I am running Sierra on my MacBook Pro 13inch (early 2015)  <comment326547> Actually the question itself is closer to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/207231/user-account-on-imac-wont-allow-applications-to-open/207245#207245 though the answer is the same, but that one has no upvotes.
