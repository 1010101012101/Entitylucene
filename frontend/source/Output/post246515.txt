Failure to Empty Trash <body> I have an iMac20 with OS 10.6.8 and an external hard drive. It appears that recently the Trash has an large amount of items. When I try to use Secure Empty Trash it counts the number of items to be deleted, then starts the deletion process and fails after a short time.  <answer246519> You could try using terminal. I suppose that you can not remove the files from external drive trash (Mac use separated trashed for each drive).   In order to remove external drive files try this:  ol liOpen Terminal/li liWrite: codecd /Volumes/{Your External Drive Name}/.Trash/code/li liCheck that your files are there with: codels -la/code/li liRemove them using: codesudo rm -rf ./*/code/li liIt will ask your password/li /ol  With that you should be able to remove your files. You can do the same for your local drive but the code.Trash/code folder is on your user folder instead of the drive root.  <comment303998> If you disconnect the external - does trash empty then? <comment304017> +1. Exactly what I would answer :) <comment304219> Yes, it appears that the problem is with the external hard drive <comment304228> Having established that the Trash was on the External Hard Drive I connected such to another newer Mac and was able to empty the Trash from there.
