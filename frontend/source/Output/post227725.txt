Enable UI for root based processes <body> I've noticed that processes that runs under root privilege doesn't show any UI on the screen. I'd like to get "unexpected termination" window for some background processes I've made, and cannot so do as long as they're running under root.   is there any way to enable UI for root account based processes?  <comment277563> It can't be done because they are running in different bootstrap context, see the Apple Technical note: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003794-CH1-SECTION9 <comment277588> You would need to log in as root to see this. There are guides online which show you how. I'd advise logging back into a normal user as soon as possible, however.
