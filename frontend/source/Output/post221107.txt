Use Magic Trackpad 2 with Google Chrome? <body> I was wondering if there's a way to take advantage of the gestures of my new Magic Trackpad 2 while using Google Chrome on OS X El Capitan.  The force touch is completely useless there, and Chrome is the app I use most of the time when I'm at my desk :(  Thanks.  <answer221214> Chromium is working on :  https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=550484  https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=481890     UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_4)   AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/44.0.2376.0   Safari/537.36      Steps to reproduce the problem:   1. Use a Macbook Pro or Macbook (2015) with an Apple Force Touch Trackpad   2. Click on a hyperlink, and push down (i.e. to trigger the second link)      What is the expected behavior? Apple has recently introduced new   trackpads on their machines that have multiple levels of "click":      https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204352      In Safari, when you click hard (Force Click) on a linked page, a popup   window will appear, showing a preview of the hyperlinked page.      When you Force Click on a link image, the image will appear in a   popup.   <answer221230> If you need to try this technology with experimental library you can do it on Firefox (Gecko):  developer.mozilla.org.  Note that this is an experimental technology, so syntax and behavior could change early in future versions.
