I am sharing my iMac's ethernet connection as a WiFi hotspot. Who is connected? <body> I would like to monitor who connects to my iMac's WiFi hotspot.  I have protected it with a password, but WEP is easy to crack. Is there a utility for OS 10.7.3/Lion to see who is connected?   <answer44105> You could use a network map like Nmap to 'map out' your connection, and see who is connected. Alternatively, Little Snitch should let you see what they do (ie what they visit).  <answer44106> codearp -a/code  gives a list of connected interfaces on the same network.  ul licodeen1/code is Wi-Fi/li licodeen0/code is Ethernet (on the Macbook Air this is Wi-Fi)/li /ul  h3How to use/h3  Type this command in the Terminal located at code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/code. To learn more about this command, type codeman arp/code in the terminal.  <answer49534> Here is a command I let in an codexterm/code (or codeTerminal/code) running to be aware of neighbour attempting to enter my WEP strongunprotected/strong Wi-Fi network:  precode/usr/bin/sudo tail -f /var/log/system.log | grep 'bootpd.*\[en.\]' /code/pre  When this window starts to scroll, I know I got a new uninvited guest at home.  If I want to know afterward who attempted to access my network, I can find it with:  precode/usr/bin/sudo grep 'bootpd.*\[en.\]' /var/log/system.log /code/pre  <comment50110> In hindsight, this is a better option. <comment50111> But does Little Snitch also show who's connected? <comment50112> I've actually never tried. I wouldn't imagine so though - just the data flow in and out. <comment50113> I use little snitch. When someone first connected, it gave me one prompt. After that, there is nothing showing a list of clients. Further, there are legitimate clients whose traffic I don't want to monitor. I simply want to know if additional clients are associated. I'll check out nmap too, but as you noted on the other answer, arp works well. <comment57250> Everyone should be aware of who is using his network, and that WEP is just… **false** security. <comment265308> The Apple way would probably to keep a Console.app window open. Note that there’s Filter kbd⌥⌘F/kbd and Find kbd⌘F/kbd available, but no regular expressions. <comment265310> @danielAzuelos At least in 2012, Apple didn’t offer anything better than WEP in OS X. Some systems, e.g. first Intel-powered Macs (32bit), are limited to 10.6 or lower.
