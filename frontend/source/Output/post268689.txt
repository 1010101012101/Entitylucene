How to find folder/mailbox buried in hierarchy? <body> I have a very large number of folders/mailboxes in OSX Mail, including folders inside folders inside folders, etc.  Lately, some of the formerly top-level folders have somehow ended up within other folders.  I'm not sure whether this is due to a bug in Mail (a bug in Mail! how could that happen!?) or due to me inadvertently doing something with the mouse that caused the change (i.e. a bug in the user :-) .  When I know that a folder is missing, I can search for it using the search box in the upper right corner of the main window and find all emails in that folder.  However, I still don't know where the folder is!  I want to drag it back to the top level.  Is there a function in Mail that will show me where the folder is in the folder hierarchy?    (I suppose I could probably go out to the corresponding hierarchy on the disk and figure this out, but it wouldn't surprise me if there's a way to do it inside Mail, and that would be easier.)  The specs: El Capitan 10.11.6; Mail 9.3 (3124).
