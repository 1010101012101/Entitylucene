Not enough storage for El Capitan; no way to free up space <body> I wanted to upgrade my Macbook 2008 from Yosemite to El Capitan.  Unfortunately, when I downloaded it and restarted my computer, on the "select the disk on which to install" page the only location, Macintosh HD, didn't have enough space (by about 2 GB).  It doesn't seem like there's a way to free up space from this startup menu, though.  I can open Disk Utility from this menu, and it seems logical to put some method of freeing up disk space from there, but if there is, I can't find it.  Is there a way to get out of this startup menu so I can free up space, or a way to free up space directly from the menu?  This is pretty frustrating because it seems like a major design flaw if it tells you you don't have enough storage for a certain thing, but it doesn't let you free up the storage to download the thing.  There's already a question exactly like mine: Stuck in update boot (not enough disk space) But no one has answered it, so I think it's okay to ask it again.  EDIT: I can also access Terminal which I could potentially also use  EDIT AGAIN: Nevermind, it looks like Macintosh HD is read-only while I'm in this boot menu.  At least terminal says "read-only file system" when I try to use rmdir on something.  <answer234397> Boot to Recovery Mode (hold kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while booting). In the menubar open Utilities - Terminal.  Now change your working directory and go to /Volumes:  precodecd /Volumes /code/pre  List all volumes:  precodels -l /code/pre  Move to your main volume  precodecd name_of_main_volume /code/pre  Now you can move forward to a directory to remove files and folders with codecd folder_name/code.  Appropriate paths to remove files or folders without touching your own data are:  precode/Volumes/name_of_main_volume/cores /Volumes/name_of_main_volume/var/vm /code/pre  Then remove files with coderm file_name/code or coderm *.*/code after making sure you are in the proper directory with codepwd/code and checking all files with codels -l/code.  The folder emcores/em may be empty, emvm/em usually contains a sleep image and/or swap files which are all disposable.  If this doesn't suffice go to your applications or your user folder and remove files/folders.  To remove a folder use coderm -R folder_name/code. In this case application files (e.g. Maps.app) are also folders!  <answer253832> So the same thing happened to me , and here is how I solved it. Go in the Recovery menu (hold cmd+r), in the top left corner, you should see the Apple logo.Click on it and select the boot disk, which should appear as your internal hard disk, you will be prompted to enter your password to decrypt it and you should be good to boot into your old system.  <answer265346> THANK YOU klanomath for getting me started with a solution that worked!!!  As someone with no knowledge of using Terminal who found this on the web, here is what I just did-  I was installing El Capitan from Snow Leopard.  After taking a few hours to start installing, it popped up and said the installation failed, and to click restart to try again.  I clicked restart, and it restarted, then asked me what disk I wanted to install El Capitan on, and I picked Macintosh HD and it said not enough space - which surprised me, because I had checked before downloading El Capitan and starting the install that I definitely had enough space.  I think the partial install had taken up a lot of space.  I couldn't get back to my normal functioning Snow Leopard, every time I turned on the computer it would take me to the El Capitan install screen.  After getting no help from Apple Support, who told me I was going to need to erase my hard drive, I started googling and found this.  Turn off computer using the power button.  Hold down command+R, click the power button, keep holding down command+R until the apple logo appears, let go.  This starts recovery mode. On the very top of the screen, went to UtilitiesTerminal.  The goal was to find big files I could delete.  Type in  emcd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD//em  to get to your main disk, if it's called Macintosh HD.  The back slash you have to put before any spaces.  If you type  emls -1/em  it tells you a list of everything in the folder you are in.  To get to my documents, I could use  emcd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/firstnamelastname/Documents/em  I think that was the path, but you can navigate around by doing  emcd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD//em  emls -1/em  it shows you a list of folders then get to the subfolder by either  emcd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Subfolder//em (typing full path)  or  emcd ./Subfolder//em  (shortcut where the . is wherever you are now) to go up a folder use  emcd ../em  Then once you're in a subfolder with some files you're considering deleting, you can use  emls -lh/em  to get a list with file sizes, so you can identify the big ones After I navigated around a while and couldn't find many big files, I googled and found I could do  emfind / -size +500000 -print/em  to get a list of paths of all files bigger than 500mb  Then I could re-navigate to them so that I could delete them  to delete use  emrm filetodelete.ext/em  (be careful you type the file name right, you don't want to accidentally delete other stuff, this can't be undone as far as I know)  To check the directory you are currently in use  empwd/em  I deleted some big video files I had and freed up several GB of space.  Check the space with   emdf -h/em  Look for Macintosh HD in the list (if that's the name of yours) and there should be some stats about % of space full, GB used vs. free, etc.  Then, in the very top left of the screen, the picture of an Apple, I clicked that and clicked "restart," my computer restarted, started the El Capitan install again, took forever, but actually finished!  And now I am happily running El Capitan and did not need to erase my hard drive.  I will be backing up some of my stuff now, lesson learned :)  <answer285744> I found a solution for me (El Capitan MacBook Air), as the above did not work in my situation because all that I could acces through Terminal in recovery mode (what it brings you to as described above) are the Sierra installers (could not eject them, no Macintosh HD). So there was no way I could delete files to free up more space.  I spent a lot of time trying to get the Terminal solution to work.    Finally I called Apple and asked to be transferred to a higher tier supervisor.   She knew exactly where I was and suggested a simple fix:  ol liOpen Disk Utility from that main menu.  /li liSelect your hard drive.  Not the name below, but the parent "Apple SSD ****" or whatever it's real name is.  /li liSelect "First Aid".  /li liOnce done, reboot.  /li /ol  In my situation my reboot brought me right back, as if I just hit "cancel" on the update. It was a super simple fix!  <comment286585> First is to find out what is using your disk and then delete it - you could start by Emptying Trash - see questions e.g. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63170/how-to-check-what-applications-are-using-the-most-disk-space/182446#182446 <comment286586> Except that I'm stuck in a boot menu, so there's no way to "empty trash" or anything like that. <comment286587> OK going Terminal and use du to find which directories use space or reboot again into your old OS and then do the check for space <comment286589> How would I reboot into my old OS? <comment286590> Doesn't just rebooting take you back? <comment286591> No, whenever I restart it shows me the menu for installing El Capitan <comment355262> Lindsey I seriously can't thank you enough for your in-depth tutorial. I spent hours on this (as a terminal newbie) and your description helped every step of the way. Not a single detail was missed, and some helpful tips included in there too. You ought to be paid for such generosity. In the end I removed a whopping 31 gigabytes of useless files. Thanks a bunch for saving my, and many others' macs. :) For others still doing this, here are extra tips in the deleting process: -Press "Tab" to auto-type the file name after typing the first few letters of the file. -If "rm" does not work to delete <comment355263> This does not provide an answer to the question.
