Cmd + Up makes Finder Jump to Root Directory <body> I've had this problem for a while in all types of Finder windows including open and save dialogs in Mac programs, that when I'm trying to navigate one directory up, by pressing Cmd + Up, Finder will jump to the hard drive root directory. It seems to happen mostly when I'm in "Column" view. Has anyone else experienced this glitch, or have any solutions? Thanks!  hr  OSX El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1217)  <comment344534> What have you done, thus far, to try and resolve this issue? It's a bit hard to offer solutions without knowing what you've already tried. <comment344551> Cmd/up will return to the 'top' of the window as you opened it. For instance, if you're digging around in the lower echelons of "Pictures" it will return to the top level of Pictures. In column view, left arrow is 'up a level'. <comment344620> @Tetsujin According to Apple [link](https://www.macissues.com/2015/04/20/remove-caches-to-fix-a-slow-finder-in-os-x-10-10-3/) Command–Up Arrow is supposed to "Open the folder that contains the current folder." While it does this sometimes, other times it jumps to the root directory like you described. <comment344621> @Monomeeth I’ve tried clearing the Finder cache, but that hasn’t fixed anything. If you have any other ideas, let me know, thanks! <comment344652> @JustinTaylor - link is to something unrelated on MacIssues. <comment344661> @Tetsujin my bad, meant to post this one: [link](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) <comment344663> hmm... that just looks plain wrong to me. What works in one view doesn't necessarily work in another... nor has it ever iirc.
