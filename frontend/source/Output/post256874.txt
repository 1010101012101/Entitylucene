Migrating from .photoslibrary stored images to external drive with symlinked images <body> Good day. Currently I have a Photos library with all images stored within the library itself (codePhotos &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Importing: Copy items to the Photos library/code is checked). I have a four month old, and I'm saving raw (.ARW) images at roughly 25MB per image, thus this is quickly becoming a storage issue (currently ~130GB). Previously, I was copying the files via python script to my HD, importing the raw files into Photos, then converting to jpeg and importing that into Flickr (Flickr won't accept .ARW, but has a free 1TB). I don't like the fact that I have to alter the original images for my cloud archive, so I've decided to migrate my library to Backblaze B2. Their API is nearing completion, so soon we should see software like Mountain Duck and ExpanDrive supporting their service, or you could just as easily roll your own. Now, you can't just copy over the codePhotos.photoslibrary/code over to a mounted bucket because the Photos app will just complain because the bucket isn't HFS+. So, I want to extract and upload the original images found in codePhotos.photoslibrary &gt; Masters/code to the cloud, turn off importing for future images, and use the cloud images as a mounted volume which Photos will use as the source. My concern is that edits I've made to certain images, tags, and datetime corrections will all be lost if I just copy the Masters and then import into a new library.    How can I move the Master images to a new location (such as a mounted B2 bucket), get Photos to recognize them and retain edits that I've made all in the same breath?    Much obliged to those who give suggestions.
