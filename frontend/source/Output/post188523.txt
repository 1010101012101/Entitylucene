Right click, text selection and window drag stops working <body> I have MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). Since yesterday I have been unable to drag windows, select text, or use the right corner click to open the context menu using the built in trackpad. Any idea what could cause this?  <comment224372> Can you test with an external trackpad or mouse? <comment224373> External mouse works <comment224375> What is connected to the computer?  Can you test with everything unplugged? (power, usb, monitors, etc.)  This article may be a help: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT203146. <comment224376> I dont think its that problem, cause the trackpad is responsive, only the clicking does not work anymore.
