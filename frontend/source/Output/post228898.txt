Open addresses in google maps instead of apple maps <body> Street addresses in Messages, Calendar, etc appear as links to click.  But when I tap on these links, they open in Apple maps.  I prefer to use google maps (or citymapper, where available).    How can I configure my iPhone so that it's opening addresses in the maps application of my preference?    <answer228904> Unfortunately, you can't (unless you jailbreak your iPhone). Anyway, from iOS 8, you are allowed to use your preferred navigator, once Maps has been opened:  ol liOpen an address (it will open with Apple Maps by default)./li liTap the "car" button, as you do to get directions./li liTap the "share" button, then tap "Transport apps"./li liChoose the app navigator you prefer, among the installed ones (i.e., Google Maps). You will be redirected to the one you chose./li /ol  It's not as changing the default, but it's surely easier than typing an address manually in your preferred app.  <answer282283> Copy address, open Google Maps, paste address.  <comment279165> Hi!  Thanks but that's a lot of tapping .. it's really impossible to change the default maps app???  But that seems like such a basic and obvious feature.. <comment279166> As far as I know, it is for customers, maybe not for Apple board director :-)
