USB-Stick (Format: FAT) retaining incomplete files <body> I'm having a problem deleting files from a USB-Stick, which is formatted with FAT.br I tried transferring files from my Mac to the USB-Stick, and if I remember correctly, removed it from the USB-port before it finished transferring the files. Therefore some files weren't transferred entirely, resulting in this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCOtV.png" alt="Image"  The three bottom folders haven't been transferred completely, hindering me from accessing them. The top two folders contain files, which weren't transferred entirely.  If I try to delete the folders, by simply selecting them and pressing ⌘⌫ it deletes them for about a second, but then they return.br I have tried formatting the USB-Stick:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XdeBV.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...but I get the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gu0KT.png" alt="enter image description here"     strongDeletion of the following medium has failed/strongbr   Following error has occurred, while trying to delete the following medium:br   The medium couldn't be deactivated.   hr  Is there any way I can delete the entire content, so I have a completely clear USB-Stick?  <answer193326> It seems as if Disk Utility can't lock the device. This is usually because some other process has open handles on a mount point that resides on the drive. As it's an USB pen drive, I guess you already tried plugging and reinserting it. Thing is: As soon as it gets mounted, something immediately seems to request a lock. This MIGHT be Finder. If you want to know which process is responsible for this, execute codesudo lsof /Volumes/Stick/code from terminal. This shows you all open handles and their respective owners affecting code/Volumes/Stick/code.  Try disabling auto mount. Unfortunately it's a bit complicated.  ol liPlug in your supposedly faulty stick. Open a terminal and wait until Finder recognizes the drive./li liEnter codemount/code. You will see something like code/dev/disk3s1 on /Volumes/Stick (exfat, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)/code. Note down the first part which refers to the device and the first part in brackets, in this example code/dev/disk3s1/code and codeexfat/code, the filesystem on that drive./li liRun codediskutil info &lt;device&gt; | grep "Volume UUID"/code in terminal, where code&lt;device&gt;/code must be replaced with the device you noted down in the second step, so you'll end up with something like codediskutil info /dev/disk3s1 | grep "Volume UUID"/code./li liThe output of this command is a UUID. It should read something like codeVolume UUID:              03D819D9-49E0-387E-AC9E-2CB54BF0DDD9/code/li liNow unplug your USB drive and run codesudo vifs/code. If you are not used to codevi/code you want to put a codeEDITOR=nano/code afterwards. Edit the last line of the file making it read codeUUID=&lt;UUID&gt; none &lt;filesystem&gt; noauto/code, e.g. codeUUID=03D819D9-49E0-387E-AC9E-2CB54BF0DDD9 none exfat noauto/code. Exit the editor./li liNow plug it back in. If you done the steps correctly, the drive won't be mounted automatically. /li liTry to format it again using Disk Utility./li /ol  <comment230315> Sounds like you tripped the firmware into locking the device. This is often irreversible, designed to protect existing data in the event of a write error. if you have a Win or nix machine, try formatting on that. <comment230316> so I can basically throw the USB-stick away? <comment230317> I'd wait to see if someone has a neat trick from terminal etc before doing that - but it's highly possible. <comment230343> It is NOT locked. It reads "Schreibstatus: Lesen/Schreiben" (that German for R/W). Does `diskutil reformat /Volumes/Stick` output some more information? Besides "The Ghost Inside" ist ein schon ziemliches gutes Lied ;) <comment230346> Are you sure it is FAT not ExFAT? <comment230351> Complicated: yes. Pretty clearly explained too :). <comment230372> @MaxRied - thanks… my German's not all that good ;) <comment230374> @MaxRied: "The Ghost Inside" is a band, not a song :D   And yes, it is FAT at the moment. <comment230375> Little bit off topic, but to me it's a song by Broken Bells. <comment230378> For me it's a Hardcore band ^^ <comment230381> Thank you! When I have access to the USB-Stick I'll try it (and hopefully accept your answer). <comment230530> I'm having a problem running the `sudo` command. The Terminal prompts me to enter my password. I don't have a password set for my computer, so when I log in I only press `ENTER`. But when I simply press `ENTER` for the password in the Terminal, it says it's incorrect. Why? <comment230531> Are you sure you don't just have auto login enabled? If so, you have to have a password set. Have a look at Systemeinstellungen-Benutzer und Konten. Set one for this procedure.
