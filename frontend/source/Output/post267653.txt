Internet Speed slow on Macbook Pro 15" Retina <body> I have a Macbook Pro 15" Retina Mid 2014 model running macOS 10.12.2. These past few months I've been experiencing super slow Up and Down speed on this machine. I have between 1-2mbps down on this machine atm.  However, my PC and iPhone connected to the same WiFi get around 29mbps. All of these devices including the mac is not about 1 Meter from the router. I feel like this issue appeared after I updated to Sierra. I've even tried running a fresh install on the Mac with no luck there either.  Any ideas on what might be causing the issue?  Thanks guys!
