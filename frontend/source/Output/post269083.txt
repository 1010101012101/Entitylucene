Change ssh connection info for Remote Login <body> I've been setting up an array of Mac Minis running Sierra, and I'm trying to be consistent about naming them.  However, for some reason, some of their ssh name@hostnames are different.  For example, the Computer Name and account names are all consistent, eg: Mini Kiosk 02 "mini-kiosk-02".  But their ssh info is sometimes different.  Some are "ssh mini-kiosk-02@mini-kiosk-02" while others are "ssh mini-kiosk-04@mac-mini".  I'm not seeing how I can change, eg, the part after the @ sign.  I thought codescutil --set HostName/code etc might do the trick, but that doesn't seem to change anything.  h2Update/h2  As you can see from the screenshot, codehostname/code does not seem to correspond to what is after the code@/code in the Remote Connection settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FuWNY.png" alt="Screenshot showing terminal window after hostname command showing &quot;mac-mini&quot; as hostname, with Sharing dialog open showing ssh mini-kiosk-02@mini-kiosk-02&quot; in the Remote Login settings"  <answer269086> Your command should work:  precodesudo scutil --set HostName YourHostName /code/pre  Since OSX 10.9 Maverick, it's possible to change it with hostname command. Without code-s/code it will be a temporary change, adding the code-s/code will set it up permanently:  precodesudo hostname -s YourHostName /code/pre  To verify it, you may type codehostname/code and observe the return.   h2Update/h2  OSX uses different variables to name the machine. You may need to reset them as well.  precodescutil --set HostName YourHostName scutil --set ComputerName $(hostname -s) scutil --set LocalHostName $(hostname -s) defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server NetBIOSName -string $(hostname -s) /code/pre  <answer269184> This looks like a DNS issue.  Be careful to check the DNS settings on one machine at a time. Focus on the machine with the terminal doing the initial ssh. Let's call that strongtestmac/strong  Compare the codessh user@host/code with codessh user@IP.address/code to see how the DNS server is giving you information on the strongtestmac/strong.  Once you're sure the DNS on one machine is working, then you can know if you need to change your DHCP server to update DNS when the Mac in question (the target of ssh - not strongtestmac/strong) received a DHCP lease. Or you could hard code things in DNS and make DHCP reservations to match what you have set up in DNS.  Trying to codescutil/code or codehostname/code your way out of DNS issues usually is ineffective at best. The Mac .local names are for mDNS so you could ssh to host.local to avoid needing to mess with DNS. Depending on how many Macs are being run or if you have viable control over DHCP/DNS that might be a fair option for some situations.  <answer269337> Did you see that you can also set the hostname via the hostname command?    So on a server try   precodesudo hostname kiosk-99 /code/pre  and then   precodehostname  /code/pre  However, if your final intention is to access the computer from another machine as  precodessh user@kiosk-99  /code/pre  this will be (as the other poster suggested) a DNS issue, because the other computer (where you type the ssh command) will need to translate kiosk-99 into that machine's IP address, i.e. it's the same as trying to   precodeping kiosk-99  /code/pre  and getting the right IP back from the name server.  Reasons then could be that you have multiple DHCP servers in the network, so when a kiosk asks the network for an IP address it gets some from different computers.    Have you checked if the IP addresses of the different miniMacs are similar?  <comment338137> Unfortunately, no. See attached screenshot in my updated answer. <comment338144> Here are the different steps I use when setting up a new mac. Does this solve your issue? <comment338148> Thanks for this angle. Just so I understand (DNS is far removed from my area of expertise) are we talking about our router that is assigning a DNS name to a machine based on its MAC address? Should I be logging into the router then? When you ask me to compare the user@host with user@IP what exactly am I comparing and how would I go about doing that? Through terminal or by looking at my router settings? <comment338170> Yes. The router does DHCP and DNS for most home and small networks. To get the IP address, look in networking preferences or use `host mac-mini` for example, @TomAuger <comment338754> There's nothing going on at the router. It's showing the same hostname, with no aliases. It must be something else. I'm starting to think Bonjour? <comment338755> Why would I have multiple DHCP servers? I only have one router, and I checked it and it's not doing anything special. It's showing the same hostnames as the ones I'm trying to change...
