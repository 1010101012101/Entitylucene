Automating document creation in Pages <body> So my actual question is broader but I'll focus on a specific example to start:  I created a Pages document with some sample text displayed in each of the available fonts for comparison. To do this I ended up having to copy/paste the text over and over, manually selecting a different font for each instance.   How would I go about automating this? Through the Terminal? And, more broadly, how do I automate repetitive tasks like this in any application? Will it depend on the application I'm using or is there a general solution for most cases?  Thanks for your help  <answer267450> As a graphic designer, a huge part of my jobs are logo recreation.  Most of the time, these logos have text that I need to identify what fonts are used.  I actually wound up creating a small AppleScript application for auto scrolling in FontBook. For my purposes, I usually have the original design with their font on one side of the screen and Font Book window right next to it so I can visually compare.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwnmd.gif" alt="enter image description here"  I actually posted a question on stackoverflow regarding the script I wrote (which nobody replied to LOL) Applescript for auto scrolling in Font Book  In that post, I have the full AppleScript code with a complete explanation for all of its functions. It's a great little script for font comparisons and such.  Maybe it could be of some use to you.  <comment335531> it's not really a task you can automate - nor is doing it in Pages really a good way to do it. Why not either use Font Book, or get a better Fonts utility, there are quite a lot around. They are made for exactly that task. Font Explorer Pro & Suitcase are the ones I've used before. <comment335536> Comparing fonts is a not a great example, because there are so many better ways to do that.  Is there some other reason you would want to automate creation of Pages (or TextEdit or Word) docs?
