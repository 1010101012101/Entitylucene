Reinstall a clean copy of Mavericks AND migrate my Apps and Settings? <body> strongBackground:/strong I bought a new laptop with Mavericks installed and used Migration Assistant to restore my environment from a Time Machine backup. It worked fine except that all the bungling I've done trying to get a working Python dev environment set up also got restored, along with a bunch of other system level junk I've installed.  Trying again for a clean system, today I wiped the drive, reinstalled Mavericks and made sure not to check "Computer and Network Settings" in the Migration Assistant dialog but I still ended up with a bunch of system level stuff I don't want (e.g. Python framework installed in my user 'Library' folder (not Apple's Python in the codeSystem/Library/code but what got installed from Python.org installer).  strongMy question:/strong I'd like to be sure I am starting fresh. Is there any way, short of rebuilding my settings and environment manually to get a clean Mavericks install?  <answer132708> I advise the following:  ol liMake a backup of the current state of the machine, this time using strongTime Machine's Exclusions Option/strong to remove the offending files (e.g ~/Library/*/python) from the backup.  /li liHolding down kbdCommand/kbdkbdR/kbd at the startup chime, boot into OS X Recovery and erase the startup volume using Disk Utility./li liCleanly reinstall OS X on the empty volume/li liOnce complete, use Setup Assistant (not Migration Assistant!) to restore the Time Machine Backup./li /ol  strongNotes:/strong  ul liYou can only restore complete backups -not incremental. The TM backup mentioned in (1) must be a complete backup. /li liBe wary of what you exclude and only exclude what is necessary. For example, excluding the /System folder will prevent you from performing a full restore via Setup Assistant. /li liWhy not Migration Assistant? It's prone to cause problems when doing a clean restore./li liThe Pondini links provided are for Mountain Lion. All the instructions work emexactly the same/em in Mavericks and are completely applicable./li /ul  <comment157888> Thanks. I think I am going to start fresh and rebuild manually â€“ too many items which I may have installed, etc. I've cloned my drive so nothing will be lost. Just chalk it up to spring cleaning.
