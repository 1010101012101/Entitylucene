Can you play the sound from an iOS device (eg ipad/iphone5) while airplay mirroring a game / video to an AppleTV? <body> When using Airplay to send a video or game from an iOS device like an iPad/iPhone to an AppleTV, is it possible to have the audio (from the video or game) coming from the iOS device so I can plug my headphones in and listen to the audio from that source rather than from the AppleTV's audio output?
