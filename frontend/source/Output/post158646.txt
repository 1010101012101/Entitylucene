How to determine what macport (if any) containing an specific file? <body> For some reason looking for an macport package what containing an specific file, in this case looking for the file:  precodesapi/embed/php_embed.h (probably should be somewhere in the `/opt/local/include/...`) /code/pre  and some php package should contains it.  I have installed the codephp55/code macport but it doesn't contains the above file.  Unfortunately the codeport contents portname/code show only the content of already installed packages.  Is possible to show (or find somewhere) what files containing some macport packages without installing them - e.g. how to find what package i need to install to get the codesapi/embed/php_embed.h/code file?  <answer158652> Answer from Stackoverflow:     Unfortunately MacPorts currently (2.3.1) only supports that if you have the port installed, i.e. if you want to find out which port installed a file on your system. In this case, you can use port provides .   The answer also suggests to use a Linux distribution (e.g. Debian) to search for the file and choose a similar Macports port with the found Debian package name:  Here is a search engine for Debian: search package content  Example:br Result for ".../sapi/embed/php_embed.h":  precodeFile                                        Packages /usr/include/php5/sapi/embed/php_embed.h    php5-dev /code/pre  <comment186475> Please check the answer at [so](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25456982/find-a-macports-package-given-a-file-name) <comment186476> @klanomath That sucks. Thanks anyways! ;) :) <comment186478> debian [content search](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages.en.html#search_contents) <comment186484> Accepting this, unfortunately macports hasn't php-dev and searching an particular file is painful. Macports is great, but terribly sucks sometimes... ;(
