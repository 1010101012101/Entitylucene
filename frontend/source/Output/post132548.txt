Connection through telnet only works in safe mode <body> I'm running Xamarin's iOS Build Host app on my machine. It uses telnet on port 5000 to allow connections to it. Suddenly, this connection no longer works.  precodetelnet localhost 5000 HELO /code/pre  returns nothing.  However if I boot my Mavericks into safe mode and do the same, I first get a question if "mtbserver" should allow incoming connections. Afterwards, the telnet connection succeeds.  Back in normal mode, I have already tried to disable the firewall but without success.  Any tips?  <answer154680> I had AirServer installier which uses port 5000. It won't be started in safe mode.
