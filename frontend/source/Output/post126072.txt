How do I remove extra extension when creating a PDF? <body> Since upgrading to Mavericks, I've noticed that when creating a PDF from another file, such as Pages, the file extension is included in the file name. Is there any way to turn this off?  For example, let's say I create a Pages document called "Proposal.pages". When I'm ready to e-mail the proposal, I'll create a PDF of the document by selecting CMD+P and then "Save as PDF".  The default title that will be chosen is "Proposal.pages.pdf". Fairly simply thing to change, but when you generate PDFs all day, it becomes bothersome.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GjSWg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone know of a way that I can remove the ".pages" extension when creating the PDF file?  <answer126091> Looks like the "Save as PDF" option in the Print dialog just takes the document title (which is set to the document name by Pages) and adds a code.pdf/code suffix to it. As the new Pages doesn't seem to offer an option to change the title within Pages you might be out of luck here.  Alternatively you could use the "Export to... PDF" menu entry to export to PDF directly.  <answer178032> When you click "Save as PDF," you get a window with a top row starting as "Save as."  On the right side of that row is a downward pointing arrow.  Click on it to expand this window to see all your options.  At this point, at the bottom left of the window is a "Hide extension" button.  <comment147624> I just tried this and I cannot reproduce.  What version of OS X are you using? <comment147625> @AlanShutko the OP is using the "Save as PDF" option in the Print dialog, the name defaults to "document.pages.pdf" there. <comment147626> Why do you use the "Save as PDF" option via the Print dialog and not the "Export to ... PDF" menu entry? <comment147627> I tried that, but I admit I'm running a beta OS. Just tried it on a bog-standard Mavericks 10.9.2 (in textedit, since pages was not installed there) and it didn't keep the rtf extension.  I wonder if LaunchServices db needs to be reset? <comment147638> Thank you for all the comments!  Using the "Export to..." option doesn't include the .pages extension, so that could work. However, I have muscle memory for ⌘P and then ⌘P again to generate the PDF, so I'd still like to find a solution if at all possible.
