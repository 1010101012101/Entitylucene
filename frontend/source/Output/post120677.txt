Dictionary: Syllable-hyphenation interpuncts (dots) missing <body> This is regarding the Dictionary app (New Oxford American Dictionary) that comes with Mac OS X. I currently have version 2.2.1 (156) in Mavericks (10.9.1).   In previous versions (Mountain Lion, Snow Leopard, Tiger…), words were shown with interpunctual dots between hyphenate-able syllables—and now they're gone.   These were very useful for copyediting…is there any way (keyboard shortcut, Terminal command) to bring them back? Thanks!

The dots are still present in the Japanese-English dictionary (Dictionary → Preferences):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKWFD.png" width="300"  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul  <answer142575> You can install the old dictionary from your old OS X install disk.  Here's what I did with my Snow Leopard disk on my Mavericks installation:  ul liQuit Dictionary/li liTurn ON hidden file visibility in Finder by typing this into Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles Yes /code/pre/li liRename strong/Library/Dictionaries/New Oxford American Dictionary.dictionary/strong to something like  strongNew Oxford American Dictionary-orig.dictionary/strong, since you'll be putting the older OS X version of this dictionary here./li liGrab the application Pacifist from http://www.charlessoft.com and run it/li liPop in your old OS X Install disk to your DVD Drive/li liFind the dictionary package.  I found mine here:    precode/Volumes/Mac OS X Install DVD/System/Installation/Packages/OxfordDictionaries.pkg /code/pre/li lidrag this package into Pacifist/li liWithin Pacifist, find your dictionary folder named strongNew Oxford American Dictionary.dictionary/strong/li liDrag this folder into /Library/Dictionaries/li liStart up Dictionary/li liOptional: Go into preferences and enable/disable the dictionaries you want.  The just-copied dictionary is probably already enabled, since it has the same name as the original dictionary.  But you can also enable the original dictionary so that both are active./li liYou can turn off HIDDEN FILE view by typing into Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles No /code/pre/li /ul  Now, I have the syllables displayed on Mavericks!  <answer179308> Just try to select in the Preferences of Dictionary app (v.2.2.1 in OS X 10.8.5) unselected "New Oxford American Dictionary" option. Hyphenation dots will show to you after this, if in Dictionary you'll search for words with "All" tab or "English (USA)" tab for results.  <answer193935> I had the same problem in OS X Yosemite, but I found a quick workaround for finding out where the syllables break. Open Dictionary, go to the Dictionary menu, select Preferences and turn on the Korean-English source. I can't read the descriptions but at least it has the "dot" breaks.   <comment140714> I don't know of any way to change the way a dictionary displays things, but the Japanese-English dictionary still has the older dots I think. <comment212539> Mac OS X version 8.5 is Mountain Lion. This issue only exists in post–Mountain Lion versions (Mavericks, Yosemite).
