Random system alert, I don't know what it might be <body> From time to time I receive this alert from mac osx img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PnN52.jpg" alt="Speech Downloader is trying to modify your system settings."  I never gave authorisation to continue, but I'm a little afraid it might be something nasty. Does anyone know what it might be?   <comment331802> See [this question](http://superuser.com/q/1131498/584424) on SuperUser.
