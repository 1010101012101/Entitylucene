Where in iOS 9 Beta 5 is the iTunes Store App? <body> Iam a verified developer and have downloaded the latest iOS 9 Beta 5 from https://developer.apple.com/ios/download/. But my other colleague has same version 9.0 (13A4325c) but he has the iTunes Store app but mine doesn't have a word of mention about the iTunes Store app.  Has it been marinated into ï£¿Music or is this a bug??  <answer204984> Ensure that Restrictions (Settings  Restrictions  iTunes Store) is enabled.  <comment247169> Did you try searching for "iTunes" via Spotlight? <comment247172> Yup searched for iTunes in spotlight and no results, even if I click on an iTunes link it doesn't load iTunes app or do anything <comment247173> Did you turn it off under Restrictions? If not, a full restore is probably the best way to move forward <comment247174> Restrictions! that did it i forgot that was on! Thank you!
