Is there an application like OneNote for Mac/iOS? <body> I'm looking for a notetaking app that is similar to Microsoft's OneNote. The main feature that I'm looking for is being able to tap/click anywhere on the document to add a text block, unlike most text editors. I'd like it to be more like handwritten notes, where you can write anywhere onscreen, rather than being forced to used tabs/spaces.br I am also looking for a Mac/iOS syncing experience, but I'm open to almost any suggestions.  <answer106500> You can try: br - Curio 8 or br  - Growly notes or &lt;- emThis is closest to Microsoft one note/embr - Circus Ponies Notebook  <answer106507> Growly Notes is the closest program I have seen compared to OneNote.  But if you're like me and want the real thing, I've setup a very lightweight virtual machine dedicated just for one note. VMWare Fusion has a feature called unity mode which integrates the Windows application windows into OSX's native window managing functions such as Mission Control just like it's a Mac app in itself.  The only downside is that VMWare uses quite some power even when idling and drops a 13" Late 2012 MBP's advertised 7 hour battery life down to 5 hours and starting up VMWare takes up to 30-60 seconds for me on average so it's kinda annoying to start up all the time.  But as mentioned before Growly Notes is the next best thing to the real deal. It's up to you as to what you really prefer.  <answer116644> Outline 2.0, released on the Mac App Store ($40) in December 2013, seeks to mimic OneNote and even sync with OneNote notebooks hosted on SkyDrive. It has a companion iPad app too, sold separately on the App Store. Polarized set of reviews though.  Also, Microsoft Office 2014 for Mac may include OneNote.

It is available in the App Store for users with OS X 10.9 or later.  <comment125157> Very good. I'm looking for freeform…but it's missing the syncing…I'll wait a little, then accept this. Thanks so much!! <comment136714> Thanks! Kinda pricey but I'll check it out! <comment148361> It's extremely limited in features however and restricts your files to only SkyDrive. In my opinion it's a complete failure
