Using Console.app - how to find disk force eject logs? <body> I've been having a number of issues with external disks force unmounting (most often while waking from sleep).  Where can I look in Console.app to track down the potential issue?  <answer169762> Choose All messages on the sidebar.  Filter by mount (or unmount)   and that is it  for example on my OS X 10.10.2 Mac mini  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0eJa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment199644> Brilliant, is there anyway to narrow that down further — looking for only improperly ejected mounts? <comment199645> If you could define improperly :) <comment199959> Any unmount that wasnt ejected properly, as in the drive was in use and or mounted when it became unmounted - thus causing an error notification about it not being ejected properly.
