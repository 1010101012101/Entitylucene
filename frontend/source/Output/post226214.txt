Whatsapp Restoring Backup not working :/ <body> Im having some real problems with WhatsApp. I have restored my iPhone from an iCloud backup and now wanted to get my WhatsApp history back, so I choose to restore from iCloud within WhatsApp, it loaded pretty slow actually but never finished.. it went to 96%, or 99% but then back to 95% and was behaving really weird. I have also tried to delete WhatsApp, restart iPhone and reinstall it, but it still continues at 95% and doesn't finish :/ does anyone know how to reset it and start downloading the backup from beginning? I really need the data of the backup...  <comment274710> I don't know if this is coincidence, but the stores were having issues at the moment you posted this. http://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/ <comment275481> I'm not sure, but I restored my complete iPhone backup again, and then somehow all Whatsapp Data was already there after the restoration finished :) Seems like whatsapp is (at least in 9.3 beta) saving the data both in the iCloud Backup as well as a Whatsapp iCloud Backup...
