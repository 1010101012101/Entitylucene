Apple Reminders make no sound <body> I make use of Apple Reminders on my iOS 10 iPhone SE but there never is any sound when the reminder is due. Do not disturb mode is turned off but it doesn't seem to matter. Anyone else who has had this issue?  <comment350263> You’ve tried going into **Settings** → **Notifications** → **Reminders** → **Sounds** and selecting a different tone? Your ringer is not muted?
