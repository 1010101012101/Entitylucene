Maverick's Mail Stops Receiving Messages from Gmail accounts <body> Once in a while (hours or even a day or two) mac Mail stops receiving messages from gmail accounts attached to it. Messages from iCloud accounts are delivered properly.  In order to solve that issue I have to restart the app or take the account offline and then back online.  Is there a way to permanently solve that issue?  <answer119889> As of Feb. 3. 2014 from the source.  OS X: New email messages not received until Mail is quit and reopened Symptoms  For some email providers, new email messages in Mail may only appear to arrive when Mail is first opened. No new email arrives until Mail is quit and reopened.  Resolution  Quitting and reopening Mail forces it to re-establish a connection to the email server. You can use these steps to receive new mail messages without quitting Mail:  Choose Mailbox  Take All Accounts Offline. Choose Mailbox  Get All New Mail. As a shortcut, you can also add the Take All Accounts Offline and Get Mail buttons to your Mail toolbar.  Choose View  Customize Toolbar. Drag the Take All Accounts Offline button to the Toolbar if it is not there already. Drag the Get Mail button to the Toolbar if it is not there already. Click Done To receive new mail messages, click the Take Offline button, then click the Check Mail button.
