How to replace an old iOS backup? <body> I'm not able to create an iCloud backup for my phone, due to insufficient space. I have 20 GB of iCloud space, currently mainly used by the backup of my iPhone (11 GB):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/glpX7.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't really understand what the problem is, since the current backup should be replaced by the new one. Do I really need to have twice the amount of space to do a backup?  I may have the problem since upgrading to iOS 8 but I'm not sure.
