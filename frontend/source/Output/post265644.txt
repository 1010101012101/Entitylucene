Is it possible to have iTerm2 restore the session history? <body> Currently when re-launching iTerm2 I'll get my window setup back, but they all share a common history. I.e. whatever is in code~/.bash_history/code. Can I get it to restore my sessions with the actual session history for each individual window instead?  <comment334098> Maybe the answers to this questions help: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/75571/62251 and http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/261003/62251 ?
