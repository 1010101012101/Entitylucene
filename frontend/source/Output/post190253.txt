How do I extract the contents of a specified text field within a webpage using applescript? <body> How can I use Applescript And Safari to extract the answer from this site: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=whats+the+meaning+to+life%3F   I'm attempting to extract the answer in copyable plaintext. That is, code.txt/code format.  I get this error:    precode"Can’t make text items 2 thru -1 of "missing value" into type text. /code/pre  When implementing the following script:  precodeto getInputByClass(theClass, num)     tell application "Safari"         set input to do JavaScript "         document.getElementsByClassName('" &amp; theClass &amp; "')[" &amp; num &amp; "].innerHTML;" in document 1     end tell     return input end getInputByClass  to extractText(searchText, startText2, endText)     set tid to AppleScript's text item delimiters     set startText1 to "x"     set searchText to ("x" &amp; searchText)     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to startText1     set endItems to text item -1 of searchText     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to endText     set beginningToEnd to text item 1 of endItems     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to startText2     set finalText to (text items 2 thru -1 of beginningToEnd) as text     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to tid     return finalText end extractText  getInputByClass("popup ui-draggable", 0)  set theText to getInputByClass("r", 0)  set theResult to extractText(theText, "&lt;pre&gt;", "&lt;/pre&gt;") /code/pre  <answer190301> Although the page you supplied is returning an image of the answers which means you cannot return text from it.  The source of the page holds the answer in text form in a javascript function.  This applescript is using one of my old methods to get the text between pattens.  I would probably now do this using ApplescriptOBJC but thought it better to keep it in Applescript with a dash of shell. As it may be more understandable.  precodetell application "Safari" to set theString to (source of document 1)  (* Strip the text and only return the last line*) set input to do shell script "echo " &amp; (quoted form of theString) &amp; "|sed -n \"/stringified/,/mInput/p\" | sed '$!N;$!D'"    global answer  set offSet1 to "\"stringified\": \"" set offSet2 to "\",\"mInput\""   my strip(offSet1, offSet2, input)  return answer on strip(offSet1, offSet2, thedata)     (* Use the offsets of the pattens to match the text # thru # *)     set textNumber1 to (offset of offSet1 in thedata)     set theData1 to text -1 thru (textNumber1 + (count of offSet1)) of thedata     set textNumber2 to (offset of offSet2 in theData1)     set textString2 to text from word 1 to (textNumber2 - 1) of theData1     set thedata to theData1     set answer to textString2 end strip /code/pre  hr  strongUpdate./strong   The OP has pointed out that there is an option to have a popup show the answer in plain text.  This is not obvious to anyone who is not familiar with the site. The popup does not exist in the page source until you click this option, which is the reason I could not find the classes the OP was referring to in the page source.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLUqj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The first script above does not need you to click any option or get the popup.  But if for some reason you do then you can use this script which will require you to have the popup on display first.:  precodetell application "Safari"     set input to do JavaScript "theclass = document.getElementsByClassName('popup ui-draggable')[0]; theclass.getElementsByTagName('PRE')[0].innerHTML;" in document 1 end tell /code/pre  <comment225836> From the looks of the website. The answers are all actually images. So you cannot extract text!! <comment225866> Yes, but there is an option to get the answer in copyable plaintext form... and the text is located in the html code where it was specified in the script above <comment225887> It would have been good if you had explained that nugget clearly in your answer. We all do not use the site. But anyway luckily my main answer works better as it does not require you to go clicking around.. I have updated my answer though just in case you do. <comment225893> @rob  This post is asking about Applescript.  Although it would be better on stackexchange. Are you sure it is off topic: Here is a quote from: http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic  “`Code-level programming questions (cocoa, LLVM, etc…) **are off-topic here**. We do encourage AppleScript, Automator, and UNIX shell scripting questions as well as how to use tools like Xcode for non-language specific tasks.`"
