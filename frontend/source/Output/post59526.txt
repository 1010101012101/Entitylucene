Set terminal window title in a script <body> I would like to change the entire title of the terminal window for a particular bash script. I googled out but I couldn't find much more than this suggestion:  precodeprintf "\e]0;My Custom Title\a" /code/pre  After running the line above, my terminal window's title becomes so:  strongft1 — My Custom Title — bash — 80×24/strong  But I would like it to become just like this:  strongMy Custom Title/strong  Any ideas?  <answer59534> Open the preferences for Terminal and untick the following flags  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DYTST.png" alt="enter image description here"  If this alone doesn't solve the problem  ul licodeunset PROMPT_COMMAND/code/li licheck whether PS1 (the prompt string) changes the window title as well/li /ul  <comment68582> Actually I was looking for something that only affects the terminal that is running the script, not the global settings. Thanks anyway for your help. <comment68583> You can create a new profile and assign this to the terminal tab/window in question.
