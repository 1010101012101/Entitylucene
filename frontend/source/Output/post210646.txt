Windows 10 partition no longer boots after El Capitan upgrade <body> I have a triple boot MacBook Pro (mid-2014 model) with separate partitions for Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux, and Windows 10 (recently upgraded, without any issues, from Windows 8.1). Before, everything booted just fine via rEFInd.  After upgrading to OS X 10.11 El Capitan, rEFInd no longer launched at startup, but I resolved that issue by reinstalling rEFInd and then running codecsrutil disable/code while in OS X recovery mode. At that point, both OS X and Ubuntu would boot up perfectly again, but when Windows (or "Legacy OS," as rEFInd calls it) was selected, the screen would turn black and say "No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key." If, instead of using rEFInd, I held "option" to get to the Startup Manager, only "Macintosh HD" would show up, none of the other disk partitions. The 350GB Windows partition still existed, but all attempts at booting from it or mounting it within OS X or Ubuntu failed.  Here's the message I got when attempting to mount the Windows partition in Ubuntu:  precodeUnable to access “350 GB Volume”  Error mounting /dev/sda4 at /media/david/a56637cf-430b-3b7e-91fb-7d710c665bac: Command-line `mount -t "hfsplus" -o "uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid" "/dev/sda4" "/media/david/a56637cf-430b-3b7e-91fb-7d710c665bac"' exited with non-zero exit status 32: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda4,        missing codepage or helper program, or other error        In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try        dmesg | tail  or so /code/pre  Someone suggested I add a "boot" flag to the Windows partition, so I did so (from within Ubuntu). The Windows partition then showed up in the Startup Manager, but selecting Windows there or in the rEFInd menu still resulted in a black screen, this time with a message saying "Missing operating system." (I have since removed the "boot" flag.)  I've also attempted to fix the issue by adjusting the hybrid MBR partition table. Using rEFInd's "hybrid MBR tool" (i.e., codegptsync/code) didn't seem to change anything, but it produced some interesting output:  precodeCurrent GUID partition table:  #     Start LBA      End LBA   Type  1            40       409639   EFI System (FAT)  2        409640    780652247   Unknown  3     780652248    781921783   Mac OS X Boot  4     781921784   1465518671   Linux Filesystem  5    1465780816   1921269095   Linux Filesystem  6    1921531240   1953947935   Linux Swap  Current MBR partition table:  # A   Start LBA      End LBA   Type  1             1    781921783   EE  EFI Protective  2     781921784   1465518671   83  Linux  3    1465780816   1921269095   83  Linux  Status: GPT partition of type 'Unknown' found, will not touch this disk. Error: Not Found returned from gptsync_x64.efi /code/pre  The disk slice of interest is #4, which, as you can see, is now being interpreted as a "Linux Filesystem" for some reason. That may be the root of my problem, but my research has not yet revealed enough about safely changing that sort of thing to have any confidence in doing so on my own, so please let me know what (if anything) I should do about that!  In any case, since codegptsync/code didn't help, I manually reset the MBR via codegdisk/code, following the same process I used when setting up my triple boot in the first place, but this didn't help either. So, again, I'm eager to hear some advice as to what I should try next.

I should also mention I've tried booting from a Windows USB to see if that could help me do some repair work, but to no avail. Also, rEFInd does not give me the option to attempt to boot the Windows partition in recovery mode.  If I have to reformat the partition and reinstall Windows, I can accept that, but I'm hoping there's still a way to recover the partition instead. Any assistance will be greatly appreciated!
