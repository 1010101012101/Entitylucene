Is there a shorcut for the 'plus' symbol on every mac window <body> On every window, there are 3 buttons colored red, yellow, and green. When you hover over the green, it becomes a plus sign. I want the keyboard shorcut for that. I know that cmd+w seems to be the red one. It does not always work but most often than not, it will close the window. Cmd+H is minimize. What is the third one?  <answer92926> You can assign a custom shortcut for the Zoom menu item in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nUXdN.png" alt=""  Or if you want to always maximize windows to fill a screen, see this question.  <comment109101> Instead of Command-M, which conflicts with the shortcut assigned to Minimize, use something more exotic, like CommandOptionControl-M. Needless to say, instead of M you can use a letter of your choice, like Z (for zoom).
