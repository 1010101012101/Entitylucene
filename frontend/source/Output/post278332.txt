Replaced HDD in fusion drive and now cannot partition or run bootcamp <body> I sent my iMac 5k with 1TB fusion drive to get it fixed and have somebody replace the internal HDD with a 500GB SSD. They were able to restore the fusion capacity with the drives; however, now when I try to partition the drive or install Windows on bootcamp, it keeps telling me I do not have enough space. I believe it is pointing to the internal 24GB SSD instead of my new 500GB SSD. How can I fix this so I can run bootcamp?  This is the error I get when I try to run bootcamp (Every time I try to free up space to that number, it increases):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKT9h.png" alt=""  This is what my disk utility shows. Notice how the listed drive size is only 24GB:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OgjWn.png" alt=""  And when I try to partition 100GB, the error says: "The request would shrink one of your Core Storage physical volumes to a size of zero. Try a more modest change in size.
