What is the best way to test Metal - MBPr late 2012 <body> I just finished upgrading from 10.10 to 10.11 and so far its allot more smooth and responsive.   I was just wondering if theres any particular games or apps which utilise the new Metal gfx technology which I can checkout now. Anything that really showcases the new technology :)   I play Guildwars 2 a little, will non Metal games benefit?  And/or is there a way to know if my Macbook is using Metal or not.  Thanks  <answer208622> As yet there aren't any games from the big dev companies utilising Metal, although companies like Blizzard are testing support and will update theirs accordingly in the 'next 6 months'  Those running 10.11 El Capitan can check whether their GPU supports Metal with this app: Metal Capability Test App
