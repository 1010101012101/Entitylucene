Block prompts when sites detect I'm using iOS <body> On many forum web sites, if you go to the site on an iPhone/iPod/iPad it prompts to install an app for the site.  But 90% of the time when I visit a forum site, it's because I'm following a search result; I never ever want to install the app. Is there some setting in iOS that disables this kind of prompt?  <answer14550> These sites are using JavaScript to detect Mobile Safari's user agent and displaying an alert.  You can disable JavaScript in Safari's settings but it's probably not worth the lost functionality.  <comment16095> On the plus side, there's probably some web proxy software that lets you change the user agent on a site-by-site basis. If your Wi-Fi network has a computer on it that's always on, you could set it up there and then just put the proxy in your Wi-Fi settings on the i-device. <comment16096> I'm assuming the user agent would be detected on the server side. <comment16097> You might be able to do something like that with [Glimmerblocker](http://glimmerblocker.org/). <comment16107> on a jailbroken iPhone, you can download [User Agent Faker](http://modmyi.com/cydia/package.php?id=3207) and change the user agent to another browser
