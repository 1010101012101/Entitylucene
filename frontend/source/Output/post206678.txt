Non-Breaking Hyphen Sequence Interpreted as Cmd-hyphen (Zoom out) <body> I'm trying to insert a non-breaking hyphen into a web app in Google Chrome. The key sequence is ⌘⇧-. Whenever I type this key sequence into a program (tested Notes, Textedit, and Chrome itself), it is interpreted as ⌘-, which is mapped to either reduce text size or zoom out. How can I enter non-breaking hyphens without using the character viewer and why does this peculiar behaviour occur?  <answer207835> To enter a non-breaking hyphen in Google Chrome just enter code&amp;#8209;/code: &#8209; em(&lt;- check the source by opening my answer in the edit mode)/em.br The underlaying web app has to support this though.  A universal method to enter a non-breaking hyphen for all apps is to enable "Unicode Hex Input" from System Preferences - Keyboard - Input Source, choose it in the menubar and enter kbdalt/kbdkbd2/kbdkbd0/kbdkbd1/kbdkbd1/kbd.  For Apple and probably some other apps you may set up an auto correct entry like nbhy - ‑. You have to type kbdn/kbdkbdb/kbdkbdh/kbdkbdy/kbdkbdspace/kbdkbddelete/kbd to add a non-breaking hyphen then.  With apps like Karabiner or Ukelele you may reduce the effort by remapping key strokes.  hr  I still have to investigate the behavior to add an explanation why this happens.  <comment251002> Good ideas! Also, I could use the source editor/inspect element an insert said code if the app doesn't support it being directly inserted.
