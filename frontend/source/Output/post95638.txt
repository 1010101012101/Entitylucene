Lowering volume on iphone 4 when button is broken <body> My iphone 4 volume button is broken.  Is there another way to lower the volume of streaming music and/ or videos?  <answer95640> Get something like Activator and set it up.  Using the set up gestures you can control your volume on screen.  <answer95643> Double-click the home button (to show recently used applications) and swipe the bottom toolbar to the right twice. The first swipe will show you playback controls, the second one volume controls.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvMTh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer95644> Use the remote on the headphones !   <comment112215> What player are you using.
