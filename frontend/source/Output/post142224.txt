Problem With the Click Command - AppleScript <body> I'm trying to do some GUI scripting with AppleScript but every time I try to use the click command, it will work but cause an error. If I use a codetry/code statement it works fine, but I shouldn't have to do that. Here's some code that I started to turn on Speakable Items:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"     reveal anchor "SpeakableItems" of current pane end tell  tell application "System Events"     click radio button "On" of radio group of tab group 1 of window 1 of application process "System Preferences" end tell /code/pre  The 'On' radio button gets clicked, but I get this error aswell:  precodeerror "System Events got an error: radio button \"On\" of radio group of tab group 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" doesn’t understand the “click” message." number -1708 from radio button "On" of radio group of tab group 1 of window 1 of application process "System Preferences" /code/pre  Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?  <answer142233> It seems that even though the UI Element shows up as coderadio group/code in 'Result', you need to specify coderadio group 1/code for the click command to work.
