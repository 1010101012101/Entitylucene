mac save dialog not showing up for TextEdit/Word/Powerpoint/Excel <body> I'm facing the weirdest issue and have spent hours googling a solution but returned empty-handed. I have a Mac early 2015 laptop with OS X Sierra(10.12.5) installed on it. Whenever I try to save a word/ppt/xls/txt file with Word/Powerpoint/Excel/TextEdit, the dialog box doesn't show up. There's no confirmation of whether it's been saved or not and I have lost hours of work because of this issue. Has anyone here faced this issue before?  Thanks  <answer294882> ul liStep1: Open a textEdit and add some text into that (fig1)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ysEWg.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liStep2: press codecmd+s/code and the following window will popup(fig2)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wDQg.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liStep3: enter filename and specify the location to save (fig3)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8b1Gr.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liStep4: press save button at the bottom of the window/li liStep5: Now this text document is saved and the code- Edited/code in the title is disappeared(fig4)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OFhtU.png" alt="enter image description here"  from now onwards when you want to save some text or documents you can press codecmd+s/code and for conformation you can check whether code- Edited/code is there in the title or not. If code- Edited/code is still there means the document or whatever it is not saved. Hope this helps. By the way, i am using Mavericks hopes its the same with OS X Sierra  <comment372156> I know this is kind of the obvious one, but is the dialog box still not showing up after a reboot? <comment372159> I tried all ways to save but it doesn't work ... the window you mention won't show up <comment372160> yeah, it's not showing up <comment372163> What happens if you Save As...  ? <comment372231> Nothing ... no dialog box shows up
