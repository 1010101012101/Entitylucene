wlan0 on a Mac? <body> I am trying to use my Mac (I have a 2010 MacBook Pro) with emettercap/em, sniffing and MitM software, but I do not have a wlan0 card. All of the tutorials and recommendations I see for these "hacks" require wlan0. I have read that if you have an older card on your Mac it would be lo0, or local loopback, but that didn't make much sense to me considering all of the traffic I was getting from emWireshark/em.   So could somebody please help me on how you are supposed to set this up? Would I need to buy a wireless card for sniffing?  <answer250111> Nothing strongrequires/strong codewlan0/code; that's just an alias for your network device.  To see what alias your system is using (most likely codeen1/code), just issue this command in Terminal:  precodesystem_profiler SPNetworkDataType | grep Wi-Fi -A10 /code/pre  This will output the system info section related to Wi-Fi.  In my case, I get the following:  precodeWi-Fi:    Type: AirPort   Hardware: AirPort   BSD Device Name: en1   IPv4:       Configuration Method: DHCP   IPv6:       Configuration Method: Automatic   Ethernet: /code/pre  (I have blanked out my MAC address for security reasons)  The device will be what is denoted by "BSD Device Name," in this case, codeen1/code  So, if I wanted to issue a command specific to my wireless card, I would use that alias.  For example:  precodeifconfig en1 /code/pre  <comment310422> The web page where your read that "if you have an older card on your Mac it would be lo0" is a nullity record. On a MacBook Pro, this card is named `en1`.
