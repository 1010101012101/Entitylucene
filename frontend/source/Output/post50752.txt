iTerm2 terminals close immediately with "argpath=login error=No such file or directory" <body> Whenever I try to open a new terminal window in iTerm, it closes right away after displaying this:  precode## exec failed ## argpath=login error=No such file or directory /code/pre  Does anyone know what is causing this? Thanks!  h3Notes/h3  ul liThe codeterminal/code is working fine/li liThe default command for new iTerm sessions is set to kbdLogin shell/kbd/li /ul  <answer50799> Not sure why it didn't work with strongLogin shell/strong selected, but I changed it to  kbdâŒ˜ command/kbd and invoked codebash -l/code or code/bin/bash -l/code to make it work the same way. Hope this helps anyone else who has the same problem!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P5EWB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer127502> I had the same error, and the cause was that my PATH variable wasn't set correctly (I had meddled with it). Restoring a proper value using setenv fixed the issue. If you have meddled with your launchd path, you must edit it with launchctl.  In a terminal:  precodelaunchctl setenv PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin /code/pre  You may have to add the path to your /etc/launchd.conf file, and restart your computer as well.

Changing the preferences as described by CMDabado fixed my problem. I've updated the answer to include a screenshot.
