Dongles to connect 2 monitors to a 13" mid-2010 MacBook Pro (mini DisplayPort)? <body> I won't be using the integrated display. Right now, one external monitor is connected through a mini DisplayPort to VGA adaptor. How should I connect a second?  <answer42640> An option for this MacBook Pro is to add a USB Video adapter to get that 2nd external monitor. They are available in a wide range of resolutions and connectivity. Not sure which is the best one to buy but here is an example of a USB 2.0 to DVI Display Adapter.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EYuZv.jpg" alt="USB to DVI adapter Example"  <answer42641> Another option to to use a display multiplexer, like the Matrox DualHead2Go DP.  This will have much better performance (frame rate / snappiness) than the USB solution, at about 4X the price.  It's best with matched dual external displays - or triple; there's also a 3-monitor solution.  I haven't used one personally, but have recommended it to clients with success.  The reviews are quite good.  <comment48481> Remember that these solutions are not good at graphics: you'll be able to use Excel or text editors but you won't be playing games. <comment48743> I agree! I just bought a DisplayLink adapter and tested it today... It's unusable to me :( I wish I had known about this earlier
