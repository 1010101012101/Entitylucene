MacBook Pro 2016 Trackpad Issues <body> Sometimes when clicking my trackpad it does not really click on the object I want to open/select. Only hard restart works.  Anything I can do about this or anybody else experienced this issue before?  <comment372805> Have you tried [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected?  Also, does the problem present in Safe Mode (hold Shift while booting)?  Be sure to include specifics like what version of the OS, which MBP specifically and where this happens the most.
