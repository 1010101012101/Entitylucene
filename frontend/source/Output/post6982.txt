Alternatives to MetaX? <body> I'm trying to rip some DVDs on my Mac, the boxset for a TV show, using Handbrake. I'd also like to automatically fetch metadata - show name, episode name, etc. But MetaX isn't getting any metadata for me for this particular TV program. Any other Mac apps I can use that do similar?  <answer6988> You can try strongHandbrake/strong. Hands down, the best I've tried.  <answer7415> Some that I've found:  ul liiFlicks.app/li liVidalin/li liiDentify/li /ul  I've yet to find one that does emeverything/em I want.  iFlicks.app comes close, but the feature I want that's missing is the ability to tag chapters.  You can always use more than one app, but I don't like the idea of different programs overwriting my metadata.  <comment7404> What sort of metadata are you hoping for that it won't provide? <comment7405> Right, I'm already using Handbrake to rip. But that has nothing to do with automatically fetching metadata. I'll edit the question to clarify. <comment7406> Name of show, episode, description, season #, etc. <comment20307> iFlicks is the best I've encountered. Recommended. <comment285876> I use iDentify pretty religiously. I'll have to take a look into iFlicks. I wish they had a free trial run. <comment324339> [MetaZ](http://griff.github.io/metaz/) is the spiritual successor to MetaX, and I just tested it on macOS Sierra successfully. Not that iDentify is no longer maintained, Vidalin points to some expired domain, and iFlicks seems somewhat minimally maintained (as of 2016).
