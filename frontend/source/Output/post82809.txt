Which low cost server device is compatible with iOS VPN on demand? <body> There is a question on "What is VPN on demand, and how do I get it to work with iOS?", however its accepted answer stronglacks detail/strong.  Envision a small business usage with only 1 or 2 iPhone/iPad devices needing VPN on demand access. This scenario has a preference for low cost and maintenance, for example it prefers an entry level device with low power consumption, self-signed certificates with long expiry dates.  Which stronghardware/strong and (specific) strongfirmware/strong, stronglicenses/strong, external certificates, modules, strongetcetera/strong on the Cisco IPsec compatible routing device are needed?  To make the question more concrete, which of these Cisco VPN boxes would be sufficient?  ol liRVS4000/li liRV180/li liRV042/li /ol  And are there step-by-step configuration setup guides, starting from stronghow to create the Cisco IPsec authentication certificate/strong on that device, to creating the corresponding profile in the Apple configuration utility?  <answer82898> A Cisco box is not required, as there is the open source strongStrongSwan/strong.  Only a device that is able to run strongLinux/strong (Debian, Ubuntu, etcetera) is sufficient.  FreeBSD or MacOSX are strongnot ok/strong as those builds only support IKEv2 only, and the iOS built in client needs strongIKEv1/strong.  Here is how to setup the iOS device for StrongSwan: http://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IOS_%28Apple%29   <comment95498> This question may be more on topic at Server Fault (www.serverfault.com), or at least you may get more Cisco people lurking there.
