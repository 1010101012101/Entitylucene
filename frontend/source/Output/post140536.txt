How do I mount Ext4 using OS X Fuse <body> I installed codeOS X Fuse/code on OS X 10.9.4  as outlined in http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/20/mount-ext-linux-file-system-mac/  Unfortunately it does not mount any of my Linux filesystems (on external HD or SD card), either directly or with codeDisk Utility/code  Has anyone had any success with this? I note a few others seem to have similar problems.  Is any other package required?  NOTE I can read the data on a Linux machine, so do NOT want other suggestions, but it would be convenient to read on my Mac.  <answer150241> Download and describe FUSE-Ext2 as described here and then run something like  precodemkdir /Volumes/Linux sudo mount -t fuse-ext2 /dev/disk2s6 /Volumes/Linux /code/pre  You can figure out the device from looking at the output of codediskutil list/code.  <answer263770> I use ext4fuse to do this job. It can be installed by issuing the following command:  precodebrew tap homebrew/fuse brew install Caskroom/cask/osxfuse brew install ext4fuse /code/pre  after installation, simply run:  precodemkdir /Volumes/Linux ext4fuse /dev/diskXsY /Volumes/Linux /code/pre  where diskXsY can be found by entering the command codediskutil list/code.  <comment165618> Did you also try it via Terminal as said here (https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/Ext/_history) under Useage. quote: "fuse-ext2 device|image mountpoint [-o option[,...]]" <comment181847> I had already done this, and it works. I really don't understand why, the `OS X Fuse` link seemed to imply it worked without, and I didn't want `ext2`. <comment218698> I get this error.. "FUSE-EXT2 could not mount because the following problem occurred: dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/fuse-ext2 Reason: image not found" Anyone else facing this? <comment218699> Nevermind, figured it out.. That was due to missing  compatibility layer. Reinstalled fuse to fix it <comment281405> Can't install fuse-ext2 on latest Mac OS :( <comment307889> On the latest Mac OS, you'll want to get fuse-ext2 from this fork that changes the install locations to be compatible with SIP: https://github.com/gpz500/fuse-ext2/releases/ <comment334884> MacBook-Pro:~ myuser$ cd /Volumes/Linux   -bash: cd: /Volumes/Linux: No such file or directory  ...before i did sudo mkdir /Volumes/Linux ... sad day :( <comment338705> It's weird, I'm also getting exactly this error :( <comment338707> Ah I've figured out what's causing it! You need to make sure you're in a superuser environment other it just won't see it. Use `sudo su` and then try to `cd` into the directory again :D <comment363421> Anybody figured out how to mount it with user permissions? Only works with sudo.. <comment363423> **IMPORTANT**: with ext4fuse by default you'll only be able to mount and see your files with sudo. To mount as regular user add your user to the `operator` group with  **`sudo dscl . append /Groups/operator GroupMembership your-user`**. Once you've done this you will be able to mount as a regular user and see the files from Finder.
