Keyboard Shortcut to manipulate window position <body> I'm looking for a 'Bring all to back' command.  In fact, I'm using Magnet and I have many superposed windows, and I would like to put the front window strongA/strong to back in order to see the window strongB/strong just below the window strongA/strong.  Actually, I'm using Mission Control (http://imgur.com/Or1bi5e) to select the window strongB/strong but I'm sure that is not the fastest way and I would like to create a Keyboard Shortcut to put the window strongA/strong to back.  Any help will be much appreciated.  strongEdit:/strong   I can resumed by: "How to put a window back of the screen" instead of the feature "Bring to front"  strongEdit 2:/strong  Screen aspect:  [strongBack/strong A B C D E F G strongFront/strong]  Screen content:  ul li[] is screen/li liA B C D E F G are windows/li liA &amp; C are from Finder/li liB D F are from Safari/li liE is from Notes/li liG is from Reminder/li /ul  Then:  ol liG is strongactive/strong/li liPut G to strongback/strong/li liGet F on strongfront/strong/li /ol  So:  If I put successively G F E D C B A to strongback/strong I will retrieve G on strongfront/strong  <answer262108> I will assume that you want to bring forward the next window of a specific application that is currently open.  Example:  ul liThree Finder windows are open in the same space/li liEach Finder window is emnot/em minimized/li /ul  Go to strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Keyboard  "Move focus to next window"/strong. Click the Shortcut displayed to the right. Enter your Keyboard shortcut.  Now you can press your shortcut to cycle through your application's windows.  <answer262130> macOS is strongnot/strong Windows!. There is no universal shortcut which sends window A to the back and window C to the front assuming window A (front) and B (back) belong to app1 and window C (front) and D (back) belong to app2 to get the window sequence C - A - B - D finally. macOS' window management always "groups" windows of the same app and you will get the following sequence C - D - A - B (in this case executing kbdcmd/kbdkbdtab/kbd).  <comment328317> Are windows A and B of the same app or different apps? <comment328332> @user3439894 different ;) <comment328334> That's working if windows are from the same application. Here, windows  A and B are from different applications and B isn't on top of the screen but below A one. However, it's a good shortcut, tx :) <comment328335> What about using CMD + Tab instead of Mission Control? <comment328336> Is there a reason you cannot use the default command-tab keyboard shortcut to toggle to the next app? <comment328337> CMD + Tab will open the last used app's window. But I want the one below. Btw I supposed that if you can bring to front, there is a way to bring it back <comment328338> @MrMojoRisin Pressing command-tab once brings the previously active app forward which should be the app window under the current app's windows. You might need to edit your question providing a better explanation and example of what you actually want then if this isn't it. <comment328339> @user3439894 I can resumed by: "How to put a window back of the screen" instead of the feature "Bring to front" <comment328363> This is an extremely poor question! The simple answer to your A-B question is either cmd-tab (inter-app) or e.g. in the Finder cmd-~/cmd- (intra-app - the shortcut depends on the keyboard layout and the app). But your question suggests ("I have many superposed windows,...") that app1 - appY have open windows windowA - windowX. <comment328374> @klanomath Look at my scnd edit... I can't provide a better explanation
