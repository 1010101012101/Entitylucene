Extension for Safari to enable Google Translation WITHOUT adding a button? <body> In the safari extensions there is a cool extension to use google translate on the current web page: "Translate".  However I don't like the fact it is adding a button to the bar. I would like to make it work as in Chrome, where the bar automatically appears when a website is in a foreign language.  thanks  <answer16523> There's an extension called Translate, you can download it here: http://sidetree.com/extensions.html (second from the bottom)  <answer16538> I'm using Franker. Translate only what i want (selected text or whole page), inject translated text into the page, no button (right click menu).  <answer81996> You can drag the toolbar button off the menu bar and still get the context menu to translate a page. This is how I use it (I also use Franker for some inline translations)  <answer81998> You could also add a custom search like codehttp://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=auto&amp;u={query}/code to Alfred, or assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "Safari" to URL of document 1 do shell script "open 'http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=auto&amp;u='$(ruby -rcgi -e 'print CGI.escape ARGV[0]' " &amp; quoted form of result &amp; ")" /code/pre  <comment18046> Isn't that what @Patrick is referring to in his first sentence? <comment18049> @Dori It is. <comment94533> There's now also an option to add a "Translate this Page" context menu item, so you can remove the toolbar item. <comment94737> If memory serves, that is an option in the extension settings. Have you checked there? <comment94738> I haven't seen any other option: http://cl.ly/7vWb <comment94739> I see we are talking about different extensions. This is the one I am talking about and it has the option to load automatically (when viewing a website in a foreign language). http://chrisgordon.ca/plug-ins/53-safari/87-google-translate-bar.html <comment94740> Ok I've added the extension and I've selected the "Load automatically" option: http://cl.ly/7vgC  However if I go to a website with a foreign language (not english), nothing happens. I've safari 5.0.5 <comment94741> Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately I have no other suggestion. <comment260456> i have just tried Translate and it looks promising. But somehow it cannot translate anything (page is unchanged), or safari said `Sorry, this page can not be translated. Extensions can not access local pages.` Do you have any solution for that? <comment302580> Seems not to be available anymore.
