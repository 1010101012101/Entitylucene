iMessage unread count on Mac <body> I use iMessage/SMS on my Mac linked from my iPhone, I have been having issues with it on my Mac lately with the unread count being incorrect.  It says that there is a message unread when its been read on both my phone itself and my Mac. I have even deleted the conversation from my Mac but the count is still there.  It seems to be from the SMS messages I receive, I have tried enabling and disabling iMessage on Mac but that did not fix it.  (I have the latest versions of Mac OSX and iOS installed)  <answer170420> ol liQuit Messages/li liOpen Activity Monitor, find the process called "Dock", then hit the top left "X" icon to force it the Dock process to quit. The dock should disappear and then reappear./li liReopen Messages. Your unread count should be reset!/li /ol
