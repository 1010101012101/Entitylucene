cmd + tab randomly switching to other monitor <body> I have my MacBook Pro plugged in to a monitor. This monitor is the primary screen, with my MacBook screen as the secondary. I'm running Mavericks, so the menu bar is visible on both screens.  Sometimes, very randomly, the kbdcmd/kbd + kbdtab/kbd panel switches to my MacBook screen, when the primary screen remains the other monitor. I have to unplug the monitor and plug it back in again to get the panel back over to the right screen.  Anyone else having this trouble? Anybody know how to fix?  <comment131695> Not a solution but a duplicate question without an answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107419/task-switcher-moves-to-non-primary-display-on-mavericks
