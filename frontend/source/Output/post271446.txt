Can I set parameters for ios Photos automatically created videos? <body> I love being able to automatically generate videos from both albums and memories in the iOS photos app. I know I can do that by creating my own album, but I was wondering if it was possible to set parameters and have it automatically create a video for me. For example. I would like all the pictures taken of a specific person in a specific year.
