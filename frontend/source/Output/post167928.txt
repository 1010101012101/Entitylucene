Where does MacOS store remembered Wi-Fi Names? <body> My mac knows about 50-100 different Wi-Fi network names. I'd like to know where they are remembered, I can't find it. I've searched.  I understand that there is a GUI for editing this information, but it is horrible.  I want to know the file where the data are stored. The Apple user interface is horrible because you can't search or sort. I have more than 100 names.  <answer167934> Ah. I finally found it. The file is code/Library//Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist/code and it's under the codeKnownNetworks/code key.  <answer167935> or alternatively, the best way to do it is to use the Keychain Access app  <answer168261> I saw that you already found a way but I wanted to teach you an easier way.   System Preferences  Network  Wi-Fi  Advanced  Wi-Fi  Use the Plus and Minus button to add/remove networks.
