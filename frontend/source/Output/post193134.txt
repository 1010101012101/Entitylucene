Organizing TV Show with automator & tvnamer <body> Previously I used Hazel (http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) and tvnamer (https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer/) to sort and rename my TV Shows Collection.  I'm trying to simplify the process by using Automator instead of Hazel, but the tvnamer script won't work as it did in Hazel  As I'm not an expert in scripting, can anyone help me out :D  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2ckw.png" alt="My current Automator workflow"  My current Automator workflow  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uvga.png" alt="The script in Hazel"  The script in Hazel  If anyone could help out will be appreciated. Thank you!  <comment230091> What isn't working? Is tvnamer being called correctly but not working? <comment230696> Hi @mjturner, when I try to run the process, it says **The action “Run Shell Script” encountered an error. Check the actionʼs properties and try running the workflow again.** I figured I might have written the code wrong or sth. <comment234793> anyone care to help? Thanks
