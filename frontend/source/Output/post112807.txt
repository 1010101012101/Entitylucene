Install Apache Module X-Sendfile <body> I wanted to install the Apache-Module X-Sendfile as shown in http://elivz.com/blog/single/mod_xsendfile/ on my Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) setup.  After downloading and unpacking the files, I've used the command  codesudo apxs -cia mod_xsendfile.c/code to run the install.  After fixing the Error "Not a directory" by creating a symlink (shown in this answer), a new problem occured :  precodelduer:mod_xsendfile-0.12 lduer$ sudo apxs -cia mod_xsendfile.c Password: /usr/share/apr-1/build-1/libtool --silent --mode=compile /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/OSX10.9.xctoolchain/usr/bin/cc    -DDARWIN -DSIGPROCMASK_SETS_THREAD_MASK -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/apache2  -I/usr/include/apr-1   -I/usr/include/apr-1   -c -o mod_xsendfile.lo mod_xsendfile.c &amp;&amp; touch mod_xsendfile.slo env: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/OSX10.9.xctoolchain/usr/bin/cc: Not a directory apxs:Error: Command failed with rc=65536 /code/pre  I haven't found any solutions by searching the web with the error code.  strongEdit 2013-12-13:/strong I want to mention that the requested Path where the Error emNot a directory/em occured (env: code/Applications/[...]/bin/cc/code)is a symlink, linking to the file "clang" in the same directory. Maybe this helps to answer the question.  <answer118397> Here's how I installed the module:  ol liDownload source code from [mod_xsendfile github repository)[https://github.com/nmaier/mod_xsendfile/releases]/li liInstall a newer Apache via homebrew, i.e. codebrew install httpd/code (note: it will not remove or damage your current, Apple-provided apache install)/li liGo to codesbin/code in apache dir, i.e. code/usr/local/Cellar/httpd/2.2.23/sbin/code/li liCompile the module (as fat-module variant):   precode./apxs -cia -Wc,"-arch i386 -arch x86_64" -Wl,"-arch i386 -arch x86_64" /path/to/mod_xsendfile.c /code/pre/li liRestart apache./li /ol  <answer147049> ol licreate your own codeapxs/code script: https://gist.github.com/dnozay/a08d4ee903af37832174 this will fix the CC path that is hardcoded in the codeapxs/code and codelibtool/code script./li lirun codesudo ./apxs -cia mod_xsendfile.c/code/li /ol  <comment133126> At the risk of 'Me too' did you figure this out? Having the same problem with Mavericks server. <comment133364> I haven't found a solution yet.  I've edited the question and added some additional informations - maybe someone can help?? <comment138175> Yes, the "secret" here is to give up trying to modify the Apple installed Apache and put your own in place. It is then **much** easier to get extras working. Always my first advice.
