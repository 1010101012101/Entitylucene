Troubleshoot sleep problems <body> My MacBook seems not to got to sleep probably. The battery is drained over night almost 25%. What is the best way to troubleshoot this?  I have a Retina MacBook Pro 13" (MacBookPro12,1) with 10.12.2. I already did SMC and PRAM/NVRAM reset.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/upQ6P.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment332083> What happens if you boot into Safe Mode and then try putting your MBP to sleep overnight? Does it show the same level of battery drain? To start in Safe Mode, hold down the Shift key while your computer is starting up.
