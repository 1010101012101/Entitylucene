I can no longer set up an Apple ID <body> I have taken over my daughters iPhone 4s and she has restored it and remove get apple and iCloud id. When I tried to set one up for me it says I can no longer set up a free apple/iCloud id on this device. What can I do?  <comment198496> use the create apple id button at https://appleid.apple.com/ then sign in on the phone.  I'm not really sure why apple limits that on devices
