Lion resolving DNS names when querying server directly, but not when used in a command or app <body> I've recently (as in minutes ago) added a hostname and reverse (A and PTR) records for a hostname on my internal network, using a Bind DNS server. For some reason, i can both codedig/code and codenslookup/code this new name successfully, but codeping/code and my GUI applications can not resolve the name.  I have attempted flushing the DNS cache on my local machine with codedscacheutil -flushcache/code to no effect.  Here's an example of my session (names, IPs changed for security):  precode$ nslookup newbox.internal server     10.0.0.2 address    10.0.0.2#53  Name:    newbox.internal Address: 10.1.1.1  $ ping newbox.internal ping: cannot resolve newbox.internal: Unknown host /code/pre  WTF? Okay, I'm sure my DNS is set up correctly though:  precode$ dig newbox.internal  ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; newbox.internal ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 33812 ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 4, ADDITIONAL: 4  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;newbox.internal.

As a side note, DNS works fine otherwise on my system. At this moment, this new hostname is the only one I'm having trouble resolving. My system is configured to use the 10.0.0.2 DNS server as it's primary.  strongEDIT/strong   Killing mDNSResponder fixed this issue.. but why?  <answer95370> From man nslookup and man dig:     Mac OS X NOTICE       The strongnslookup/strong command does not use the host name and   address resolution or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other   processes running on Mac OS X.  The results of name or address queries   printed by nslookup may differ from those found by other processes   that use the Mac OS X native name and address resolution mechanisms.    The results of DNS queries may also differ from queries that use the   Mac OS X DNS routing library.   man host has the same notice.  ping however does not.  More information and possible solution here:  DNS lookups fail with e.g. `ping`, but work with `host`  <answer133144>    Killing mDNSResponder fixed this issue.. but why?   Because you flushed the local DNS cache!  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5343  A direct lookup command will query the DNS server directly, however the resolution mechanism for just about anything else is that mDNSResponder process you killed.  dscacheutil -flushcache is deprecated as per the KB.  <comment157901> I did not know that was the official method. Neat, and thanks for the pointer!
