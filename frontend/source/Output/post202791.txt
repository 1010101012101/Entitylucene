How to turn on message notification while im on the phone call? <body> I'm using ios 8.4 When I'm talking on a phone, I hear a message notification, I immediately take the phone away from my ear to read the message but it never shows. So I only get the message sound but dont see the message itself (until i end the call). How do i fix it? Coz i remember in the previous update i had no problem with it and i could see the messages while talking on the phone. sorry for my bad english and i hope someone knows a way to resolve this.  thanks
