Random slideshow of pictures and videos without saving to Photos <body>    How can I view a randomized slideshow of photos and videos on an SD   card without copying files onto my hard drive?   Please correct me if I'm wrong, but strongPhotos/strong requires one to import images before you can view them. Both strongQuick Look/strong and strongPreview/strong allow us to view multiple images without copying them to hard drive, but with a fixed-order (slideshow or manual flicking). I googled some 3rd-party apps, but all seem to either not support videos or also require one to import files.  In sum, what I'm looking for is a way to:  ul liDo random slideshows of both photos and videos./li liWithout having to copy files to hard drive./li liPreferably from strongFinder/strong, but if not possible, happy to do it within the GUI of another app./li liIf 3rd-party software, preferably free, but happy to pay if free ones don't exist or are too buggy./li /ul  Thanks for any ideas!
