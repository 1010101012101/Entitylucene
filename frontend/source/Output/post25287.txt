How do you prevent a process from automatically restarting? (specifically, sophos antivirus) <body> I am required by my VPN software to have Sophos anti-virus installed and running.  However, when I'm NOT on VPN, I don't want it running at all - I want it dead.  However, killing the tasks is ineffective:  precodeps -ax | grep -i soph 40972 ??         0:07.34 /Library/Sophos Anti-Virus/SophosAutoUpdate.app/Contents/MacOS/SophosAutoUpdate -d 41069 ??        28:08.48 /Library/Sophos Anti-Virus/InterCheck.app/Contents/MacOS/InterCheck -d 41078 ??         0:02.42 /Library/Sophos Anti-Virus/SophosAntiVirus.app/Contents/MacOS/SophosAntiVirus -d $ sudo kill 40972 41069 41078 41084 $ ps -ax | grep -i soph 44344 ??         0:00.03 /Library/Sophos Anti-Virus/SophosAutoUpdate.app/Contents/MacOS/SophosAutoUpdate -d 44345 ??         0:00.02 /Library/Sophos Anti-Virus/SophosAntiVirus.app/Contents/MacOS/SophosAntiVirus -d 44347 ??         0:03.03 /Library/Sophos Anti-Virus/InterCheck.app/Contents/MacOS/InterCheck -d /code/pre  It just automatically restarts.  What do I need to do to prevent that?  <answer25291> This means that there is another monitor process which relaunches it.    You can check out who is the parent process: select the process in activity monitor and use the Info button, or via terminal with codeps -ax -O ppid/code if I recall correctly.  ul liIt might be another process by Sophos but with a stealth name, or maybe even your VPN software. In that case you can just codekill/code'em all./li liThe other possibility is that the process is being kept alive by the launch daemon codelaunchd/code. In this case you will find an entry (a plist XML file) for your antivirus in either code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code, code/Library/LaunchAgents/code (likely) or code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/code (I dearly hope not).  /li /ul  If the second is the case, you can either:  ul liEdit the file, and change the KeepAlive parameter, either removing or changing it (you can do nifty things, see the docs for more)./li liJust ask launchd to do the stopping for you. Unfortunately you can't just tell to codelaunchtl stop/code since the process would just respawn. You'll have to use br codesudo launchctl unload /path/to/the/plist file/code /li /ul  <answer25349> I'd comment on Agos' post, but I'm too new to do that. So:  As far as I remember they should have a launch agent in code/Library/LaunchAgents/code. I'd just ask you to do a codels /Library/LaunchAgents/code, codels /Library/LaunchDaemons/code and codels /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/code. Something strongwill/strong show up.  Also you could open code/Applications/code and check Uninstall Sophos.app with codeShow Package Contents/code then check out the uninstall script.  <answer25382> You can also control which Launch Agent and Daemons run and when with the useful app Lingon, available through the Mac App store and online.  <answer26136> precodeman launchctl   launchctl list |grep -i 'sophos' /code/pre  to unload a daemon permanently, but not uninstall it  precodelaunchctl unload -w /full/path/to/file.plist /code/pre  <answer217821> To find out which codelaunchd/code job is spawning things back, codetail -f /var/log/system.log/code and codesudo kill -9 &lt;pid&gt;/code the process you are interested in.  Suddenly, codelaunchd/code will tell you exactly which job is responsible:  precodecom.apple.launchd[1] (com.sophos.managementagent[83911]): Exited: Killed: 9 /code/pre  You can also try increasing the log level to precisely determine what's happening: codelaunchctl log level debug/code  Bear in mind that some jobs will be run as coderoot/code, so codesudo launchctl list/code might show you some extra jobs running on your machine.  <comment28570> It is possible there is a preference in the Sophos software to turn it off? <comment28583> Thanks Agos, that's exactly the advice I was looking for.  However, I can't find the darn thing!  There are no PIDs with numbers near (the original, pre-killed) Sophos Anti-Virus that I can associate with it.  Nothing turned up in the LaunchAgents directories (though all I did was a simple regex check in /System/).  Is there any log file in which launchd would record restarting a process?  I've checked system.log and others without luck... <comment28584> Not as far as I can tell; if it's there, it's hidden. <comment28666> Thanks Ghost.  The directory Agos left out was /Library/LaunchDaemons, which has the plist file.  I gave you a +1, but Agos the answer, since he got most of it. I greatly appreciate the assistance! <comment28671> Make sure you run spotlight to look for Sophos files left  behind after the 'uninstall' mdfind -name Sophos <comment29788> @chiggsy why would he do that? He doesn't want to uninstall the application but prevent it from restarting every time he kills it. <comment29800> That's it? That's all he wants? <comment29855> This is the "better" answer because it will also prevent it from loading ever (-w) <comment207202> sophos hides.  This doesn't work on sophos. <comment295076> The file for me was here `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sophos.common.servicemanager.plist` - you can find via `mdfind -name Sophos`. Removing the Keep Alive parameter worked.
