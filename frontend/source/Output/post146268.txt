Monitor which website my applications are trying to connect to <body> I am looking for a way to monitor my network so I can know which website that specific application is trying to connect to.  <answer146269> h2Little Snitch/h2  Whilst it's mainly a firewall, it alerts you when an app connects to a certain domain, and lets you allow/block the connection.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/teKgu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, you can allow all connections and just monitor them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JUD1p.png" width="300"  h2Rubbernet/h2  Rubbernet is also a good alternative, providing the additional feature of remote monitoring of Macs on a network.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6a85w.png" alt="Rubbernet monitor"  <answer146270> An excellent monitoring tool for this purpose is Little Snitch.  http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html  Macworld gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars ( http://www.macworld.com/product/1250383/little-snitch-3-0-1.html )  <comment172342> I'm presuming OS X; if you meant iOS please edit your question.
