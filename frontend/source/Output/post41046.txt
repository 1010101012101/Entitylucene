Shuffle songs in playlist only <body> Is there a way, in an 80GB iPod video (I think that's what it's called) to shuffle only the songs in my playlists?  In other words, when I drop into a playlist I want the songs to be shuffled, but when I drop into an album, I want to hear it in order.  Is that possible?  It seems like my only three choices for the codeshuffle/code setting are codesongs/code, codealbums/code and codeoff/code.  Is there some other way that I'm missing?  <answer41080> Shuffle is a global setting. You can't turn it on for playlists but not for albums.
