Can I use Firewire or Thunderbolt cable with this hard drive dock? <body> I'm an external hard drive docking station: http://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-BlacX-eSATA-Docking-Station/dp/B001A4HAFS/. I'm currently using the USB2.0 cable that comes with it. I wonder if I could use Firewire or Thunderbolt or USB3.0 to speed up data transfer with it.  <answer167061> From the link provided:  ul liSupports eSATA Transfer Speed up to 3Gbps/li liSupports USB 2.0 Transfer Speed up to 480Mbps/li /ul  For the 3Gbps transfer speed you will need the StarTech 6-Feet Shielded External eSATA Cable M/M (ESATA6)  and the Thunderbolt to eSATA adapter  <comment195843> Oops - missed that.
