5k iMac with 2 34 inch monitors <body> I have a 34 inch iMac 5k (late 2015), configured with the top specs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rupU7.png" alt="iMac specs"  I'm currently running a 34 inch 3440x1440 monitor linked via thunderbolt. I recently ordered a second one.   I've googled around and while there are many threads about supporting a single 34 inch monitor, I couldn't see any about supporting 2 at once.  I'd like to know if it's technically feasible to do so.   <comment290392> I'm thinking about this exact setup! Were you able to get it working? <comment290988> @Kevin Yes, it's working :) I also learnt that this iMac spec is the only iMac powerful enough to run this setup. If you don't have m395x it won't run!
