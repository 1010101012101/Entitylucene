Segmentation Fault Generating Self Signed Certificate using OpenSSL on OS X <body> I am trying trying to generate a private key and a self signed certificate from my terminal on OS X El Capitan (10.11.1) using the commands below:  precodeopenssl genrsa 1024 &gt; private.key openssl req -new -key private.key -out cert.csr openssl x509 -req -in cert.csr -signkey private.key -out certificate.pem /code/pre  each command that I run returns the following error message:     Segmentation Fault: 11   If I run codewhich openssl/code, I get the following:  precode/usr/bin/openssl /code/pre  So I assume that it has been installed correctly. Does anybody know what the issue may be ?  <comment307637> Try running openssl by itself <comment307983> Tried it, still gives the same error, so does openssl version <comment308150> By any chance, do you have Homebrew or Macports installed? <comment308348> I have homebrew installed and tried brew install openssl but still had the same issue
