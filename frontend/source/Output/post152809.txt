Getting unknown command error when trying to run a bash script <body> I recently had to re-install 10.9.5 (default install) and am now finding that bash scripts that run perfectly from the command line (~/Me...) no longer work using crontab. I use crontab to invoke "Diskutil unmount volumeX" but am getting mail from cron saying "diskutil" command not found. Is it a PATH issue and if so how would I fix it. Thank you in advance for any help.  <answer152876> codecron/code uses code/usr/bin:/bin/code as the default codePATH/code and codediskutil/code is in code/usr/sbin/code.  Specify the full path to codediskutil/code or add a line like codePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code to the start of your crontab.
