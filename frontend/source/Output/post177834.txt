How to take screenshot in Boot Camp? <body> I have MacBook Pro Retina running Windows 8.1. I do not have a PrtScr key. Also, shift+fn+f11 key combination doesn't work. What is the shortcut to take screenshots?  <answer177838> Use the strongSnipping Tool/strong that ships with Windows, it's made for that exact purpose. The Windows help page is here, info found using this search tool ;-)  <answer177839> kbd⇧ shift/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdF11/kbd is the correct keyboard shortcut to emulate a Print Screen in Windows, however this shortcut requires the Boot Camp drivers to be installed and be running in Windows. Make sure you have the drivers installed correctly and check whether the keyboard is configured to require fn in Boot Camp Control Panel.  <answer177843> If you hear the click sound when taking a screen shot the the shot has been taken and it is in your Clipboard.   To get it, open any application (like paint or other) and use the "Paste command" to see it/modify and save as a file in a location of your choosing.  <answer243943> The FN+Option+Shift+F11 (and also FN+Shift+F11) will only work if you have the setting on Boot Camp Control Panel tuned off (unmark the checkbox):  Keyboard tab  "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys..."  Extra tip:  FN+Shift+F11 = Captures the full screen  FN+Option+Shift+F11 = Captures the current active window  <comment210471> FN+Shift+F11 and FN+Option+Shift+F11 is the correct key combo! are your F keys set as F-keys or not? on syst preferences . <comment210473> @Buscar웃 those key combinations doesn't work. <comment210474> @Buscar웃 F keys set as F-Keys? what's that? How to check that? <comment210476> @Buscar웃 Windows 8.1 doesn't have any system preferences are you talking about mac's system pref? but i want to take screen shot in windows <comment210482> @Buscar웃 There is not such option....there are only two tabs in keyboard settings....speed & hardware <comment210488> Snipping tool doesn't capture windows apps please edit your answer <comment210489> According to the Microsoft page I linked to, yes it does. What exactly are you trying to capture? A full-screen app? All this would be helpful information to share. Please edit your question ;-) <comment210490> Whilst this might not directly answer your question regarding keyboard shortcuts @and, it is a valid answer to how to take screenshots in general and may be useful if you are unable to get a keyboard shortcut working. <comment210492> i have installed bootcamp softwares correctly i guess. How to verify? I see Bootcamp in control panel. For, keyboard preference(in bootcamp) i only see use F keys as they are named and not fn + F keys <comment210493> @and Try just ⇧F11 without fn and see if the shortcut works. <comment210494> it doesn't work either <comment210496> when you press F11 or F12 what happens? <comment210498> @Buscar웃 nothing happens but if i press fn + f11 or fn + f12 volume increases or decreses <comment210500> nice, that means your top row is enabled already as F-keys, it also means your Fn key is working. Otherwise F11/F12 without Fn would adjust volume. It also means you do not have to use Fn for the screen shot, thus Shift+F11 should do it (the left Shift key). This assumes you do not have the Shift+F11 assigned to something else. <comment210501> @Buscar웃 that doesn't work :( <comment210503> still the same...doesn't work <comment210504> Wait...what do you expect to happen? did you check the folder where your screen shots are saved ? <comment210505> Yes the folder is empty....I didnt wait for that click sound...i went to pictures/screenshot and its empty <comment253080> The snipping tool is useless if you're trying to take a screen capture of a web page component that disappears when it loses focus. <comment340853> This doesn't appear to be the case for Windows 10 (at least 1607). No combination of function key checkbox and Fn+Shift+F11 results in a screenshot on my new Boot Camp install.
