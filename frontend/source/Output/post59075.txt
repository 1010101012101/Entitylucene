How to set screen resolution with a keyboard shortcut on Retina MBP? <body> I've found myself switching between the 1440x900 and 1920x1200 "effective resolution" setting depending on what I'm doing (need more space on screen, etc).  ol liIs there a way to toggle between these two modes with a keyboard shortcut?/li liCan I invoke one mode with a keyboard shortcut?/li liAlternatively, can this be done via an AppleScript (and therefore bound to a keyboard shortcut)?/li /ol  <answer59097> Alright, so SwitchResX 4 seems to be able to do this, in a few easy steps.  ol liInstall SwitchResX 4 (Duh)./li liLaunch The SwitchResX 4 Preference Pane, which should look like something below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ooplf.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liFrom there, go to codeDisplay Sets/code, and add a new set, which we'll call codeRetina - Full Size/code, and map it to a hotkey combination (in this case, I chose codeopt + F1/code), and select the full size resolution (1920 x 1200). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NQupE.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liCreate a second set, which we'll call codeRetina - Better Looking/code, and map it to the proper resolution &amp; keys (I chose 1600 x 1000 &amp; codeopt + F2/code, respectively). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WxkAS.png" alt="enter image description here"/li li???/li liProfit! You have now set up SwitchResX to be able to resolution switch. (Note: This program is shareware, and I am not associated with it in any way.

I don't know if this would work with multiple displays.  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     tell tab group 1 of window 1         click radio button "scaled"         tell table 1 of scroll area 1             if selected of row 1 then                 set selected of row 2 to true             else                 set selected of row 1 to true             end if         end tell     end tell end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  You can give the script a shortcut with Alfred or FastScripts or by creating an Automator service.  <answer71721> h2QuickRes (4 USD)/h2  Based on your description, QuickRes appears to perfectly accomplish what you're trying to do.  You can set multiple (up to 8) resolutions in its preferences and assign keyboard shortcuts to them.  To access preferences, launch QuickRes and kbdCtrl/kbd-click (right-click) the icon that will appear in the menu bar.  subNote that Mac will give you an error and claim that it is from an "unidentified developer"; simply kbdCtrl/kbd-click the app's icon in Finder and click open. /sub  Screenshots are below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g2coN.png" alt="enter image description here"  QuickRes options.  Click Preferences. Also, after you set resolutions, you may simply click this icon normally to toggle between resolutions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JcaWH.png" alt="enter image description here"  Resolutions pane of QuickRes preferences.  You may add more preferred resolutions in "Advanced." Also, because this was taken on an iMac, you will have different resolution options for your MacBook Pro Retina.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4VRCe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Shortcuts pane of QuickRes preferences.  Right now, my shortcut is kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdR/kbd.  You can change this, of course.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYZNl.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the Advanced pane, you can set how many resolutions you wish to toggle.  strongThe shortcut only works when you have QuickRes open (it's a lightweight app, so don't worry about resources), so I would recommend selecting "Open QuickRes on Login" to get it out of your way./strong  <answer73304> Quicksilver can do it also if you enable the Displays plugin. I use it all the time. You can assign triggers to specific resolutions/actions as well.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIRxh.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also see http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/utilities-roundups/10-essential-quicksilver-plugins/ for a quick description. And here is the description from the help:     Displays Pluginbr   The displays plugin allows Quicksilver to index the displays currently attached to your Mac, in order to set the Desktop   picture and their resolution, colour depth and refresh rate.

Allows you to assign a global shortcut.  <answer91590> I use an AppleScript that toggles through 3 of the 'scale' options depending on the current option...  precodelocal index1, index2, index3  set index1 to 3 -- 1440 x 900 (Best for Retina) set index2 to 4 -- 1680 x 1050 set index3 to 5 -- 1920 x 1200 (More Space)  -- Launch "System Preferences", open the "Displays" options and change to the "Display" tab tell application "System Preferences"     activate     set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.displays"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane id "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell  local indexToUse  -- Now lets make the necessary changes tell application "System Events"     tell window "Color LCD" of application process "System Preferences" of application "System Events"         tell tab group 1              -- Click the "Scaled" radio button             click radio button "Scaled"              tell radio group 1 of group 1                 -- Depending on what scale option/index is current selected, set the appropriate new option/index to use                 if (value of radio button index1) is true then                     set indexToUse to index2                 else if (value of radio button index2) is true then                     set indexToUse to index3                 else                     set indexToUse to index1                 end if                  -- Click the radio button for the new scale option/index                 click radio button indexToUse             end tell          end tell          -- If option/index 1 is selected a warning prompt is displayed, click the OK button to dismiss the prompt         if indexToUse = 1 then             click button "OK" of sheet 1         end if     end tell end tell  -- Quit "System Preferences" quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  <comment68107> I would say that this should be able to be done using AppleScript, but I have no clue how. <comment68121> Unfortunately, SwitchResX doesn't seem to workâ€”it doesn't save my display sets and the keyboard shortcuts don't do anything. <comment83311> +1 The best solution is always one that does _not_ require third-party software!  I always forget about AppleScript :) <comment83316> Beautiful, exactly what I'm looking for. <comment163024> No longer free, now 4 USD with no demo version available. Does work well, though.
