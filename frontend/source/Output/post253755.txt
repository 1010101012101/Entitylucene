Can anyone recommend a free stop watch or timer which stays always on top? <body> Can anyone recommend a free stop watch or timer which  stays always on top on every application for MacOSX?  I want to count hours when i am programming or browsing ! it should appear on top on every app like browser or editor !  <answer253765> I use Apimac Timer, which has a free edition. It can count up (stopwatch), count down (timer), or display the current time. In "iconized" mode, it stays on top of other windows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/roYRo.png" alt="Apimac Timer preview"  Edit: Whoops. After some seconds, the free version abandons iconized/always-on-top mode and displays an ad for the paid version.  <answer253766> ActivityTimer is a Timer that's free in App Store and has an option to display countdown time in the emMenu bar/em in digital or analog form.  I do not know that it can count up (like a Stopwatch).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bce5r.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment315795> Take a look at [this answer](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for ways to ask for a software recommendation.
