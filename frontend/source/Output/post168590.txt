Cannot compress any file <body> I get a popup "The contents list canâ€™t be created for compressing." every time when I try to compress a file.  And also thumbnail preview is not working.   I am sure if both issues are related but they both happened today.  I've tried repairing disk permissions, deleting finder plist, restart but none of this works.  I am running Yosemite 10.10.1  Any suggestion?  =================================  strongI went to Apple Store and they can't fix this. They reinstall the Mac for me./strong  Thanks for all answers.  <answer168594> Try downloading The Unarchiver on the App Store and create the zip file with that. If that does not work go into your terminal and type codekillall Finder/code. That terminal command should deal with the thumbnail issues and hopefully the archiving problem as well.  <answer169253> Run the following commands in order in Terminal. Same issue for me and fixed it. I'm not sure what's causing it but I have to run it every so often to fix it.  precodesudo mkdir /private/tmp sudo chmod 0777 /private/tmp /code/pre  <answer275943> Usually, this is because you don't have enough disk space left on the drive you're creating your backup.  <comment197906> Thanks but it didn't work. <comment197912> is it the same file or any file? <comment197938> ACLs issue perhaps? Though idk how to clear them in Terminal, I'd use Cocktail etc. <comment197987> @Tetsujin Thanks. Just tried Cocktail but it didn't help. <comment198438> What are you trying to compress ? [on Unix all is file] However, you can put your "file" into a directory and compress this one. <comment198440> @MrMojoRisin Thanks I can still compress a file from command line: zip and tar. I was able to do it with the right-click until the day I asked the question. (And I know I can put a file in a "directory" and compress it.)
