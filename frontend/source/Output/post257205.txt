New iTunes connect field "Client" with "App Store iMessage" value, what does it mean? <body> Alongside the release of iOS 10 we published a sticker extension to our iOS app. While looking into the iTunes connect records I noticed that a new field "Client" was added with no value or "App Store iMessage" (all those records were linked to downloads wit the "Product Identifier" value set to 1).  Are these activations of our Sticker extension in iMessage or downloads of our app generated through our Sticker app page in the App Store for iMessage as I'm tempted to believe?  Thanks!
