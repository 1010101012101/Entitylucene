Cannot uninstall git - git clone broken <body> I cannot clone any repository on my mac anymore. I don't know since when exactly it got broken.  precode$ which git /usr/local/bin/git  $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:myaccount/myrep.git Cloning into 'myrep'... conq: repository does not exist. fatal: Could not read from remote repository.  Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists. /code/pre  The thing is my ssh id_rsa key is still the same. I recreated it anyway, updated it in my codeBitBucket/code account's ssh keys, and the same error shows up when I try to clone my repository. I tried the very same procedure on another machine (redhat) and git clone worked. So there is something happening with my version of git.  I thought about reinstalling git. So I first tried uninstalling it:  precode$ brew uninstall git Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.9.0... (1,424 files, 31.3M) /code/pre  but it seems to be several versions of git installed:  precode$ git # displays the usage here  $ which git /usr/bin/git /code/pre  So I retried using this version:  precode$ git clone git@bitbucket.org:myaccount/myrep.git Cloning into 'myrep'... conq: repository does not exist. fatal: Could not read from remote repository.  Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.  /code/pre  Still not working. I tried removing those git files:  precode$ rm -f /usr/bin/git* rm: /usr/bin/git: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-cvsserver: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-receive-pack: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-shell: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-upload-archive: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-upload-pack: Operation not permitted  $ sudo rm -f /usr/bin/git* Password: rm: /usr/bin/git: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-cvsserver: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-receive-pack: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-shell: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-upload-archive: Operation not permitted rm: /usr/bin/git-upload-pack: Operation not permitted /code/pre  Even with sudo I cannot remove them, why? Do you think my git clone issue might come from that? I have no idea what to do anymore. I need to use git on that computer so badly I have been very stuck.  precode$ ls -a /usr/bin/git -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    18K May  5 08:05 /usr/bin/git* /code/pre  <answer246204> Please try codessh -T git@bitbucket.org/code to check connection to Bitbucket.  https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/troubleshoot-ssh-issues-271943403.html#TroubleshootSSHIssues-ssh-Tconnectiontest(GitBash/MacOSX/Linux)  <answer246212> Problem solved. It wasn't obvious to me but itwas about global configuration. I played a bit with the command codegit config --global/code which set a hidden git config file in my home folder. There was the information regarding another remote I set back then. This remote pointed to a repository which I deleted so git clone tried to fetch information from that deleted repo first. I just deleted that git global configuration file.   <comment303486> It's a very bad idea to attempt removing stuff from `/usr/bin`
