How do you diagnose why a keyboard shortcut does not work? <body> I am trying to get Command+Alt+Shift+L to work in RStudio on OSX. I have a large number of customisations that might possibly prevent this shortcut from working. I've gone through the usual places (e.g., system preferences - keyboard; Alfred; Better Touch tool). Thus, I thought there might be some more general procedure for working out what program, if any, is intercepting the shortcut  strongIs there a way of seeing what program might be intercepting a particular keyboard shortcut?/strong  <answer88150> There is app called KeyCue that will help you find the keyboard shortcuts in use by your system.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzzi3.png" alt="enter image description here"  It is shareware.  More info and to download : http://www.ergonis.com/products/keycue/  <comment103162> does anything happens when you do it ? <comment103164> you could look it up in system pref keyboard, shortcuts <comment103168> @Buscarì›ƒ Nothing overt happens, when I press the key; I've already looked up system pref keyboard, and I couldn't see anything. <comment103169> Thanks; From what I can tell, KeyCue does not list all shortcuts. For example, it did not list BetterTouchTool global keyboard shortcuts. <comment103175> @JeromyAnglim Stupid question, Do the other shortcuts work in RStudio ? <comment103182> yes. the other shortcuts work in Rstudio <comment103188> sometimes and do not ask why, try the right hand alt key <comment103198> I think it is the Command+Alt+Shift+(I) or Command+Alt+Shift+l not Command+Alt+Shift+L
