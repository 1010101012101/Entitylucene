How to input accented characters to an OS running in a VM? <body> I have a MacBook Pro with English (US) keyboard layout. I usually hold the right-alt (option) key, and press kbdE/kbd to activate the accented vowel insertion (it shows a placeholder where the accented letter—codeá/code/codeÁ/code, codeé/code/codeÉ/code, codeí/code/codeÍ/code, codeó/code/codeÓ/code, codeú/code/codeÚ/code—would appear), and after pressing the corresponding vowel it will be inserted in place. Similar procedure using the kbdN/kbd key to insert the codeñ/code/codeÑ/code characters.  I also have an Ubuntu Desktop computer with Latin American keyboard layout. Latin American Spanish keyboards have the acute accent character code´/code right after the P key. In order to insert an accented vowel, you type first the acute accent, and then the vowel. Similarly to insert the codeñ/code/codeÑ/code characters, one would type the code~/code character and then the coden/code/codeN/code letter.  Everything fine until here.  The problem is when I have to run a Linux OS on a Virtual Machine (VirtualBox) on the Mac. I don't have the code´/code character on the physical keyboard, and the right-alt (option) key doesn't have the same effect as in Mac OS.  The question here is, if there's a way to insert international (or at least accented vowels, which are the ones I mostly use) characters from the physical keyboard of the Mac, to the guest OS in the VirtualBox?  <answer192810> Mine defaulted to the Spain keyboard setting. The Spain keyboard has the ñ/Ñ characters right after the L-key and the acute accent character one space after that: [L] [Ñ] [´]. The ñ/Ñ characters need no extra work In order to insert an accented vowel you would press the acute accent, then the vowel and release.  <answer192814> You can simply change the keyboard layout in Ubuntu without any changes to OS X:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMvCi.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then you can type like you would do on your Latin American keyboard.  <comment77188> You may need to use the character map in Ubuntu.
