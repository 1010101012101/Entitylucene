TarPit not working in Mavericks <body> One of my favorite applications appears not to be working after making the upgrade to Mavericks. I am referring to TarPit which creates easily archives for me. I just loved this application since on command line creating a tar.gz would also include the .DS_Store files, and other similar nonsense.  So, is there a workaround and making TarPit work again? Is there an alternative to TarPit?  <answer107830> I have this alias in my code~/.bash_profile/code:  precodealias tarc='COPYFILE_DISABLE= tar --exclude .DS_Store -c' /code/pre  It can be used like codetarc -zf directory.tgz directory/code or codetarc -f directory.tar directory/code.  Setting COPYFILE_DISABLE tells tar to remove extended attributes, ACLs, resource forks, and Finder information. tar uses AppleDouble files (the files that start with ._) to store metadata by default, and it also knows how to convert metadata stored in AppleDouble files back to the native formats, but unarchiving applications on other platforms usually keep the ._ files.  precode$ touch a;xattr -w key value a;tar -cf a.tar a;tar -tf a.tar ./._a a $ COPYFILE_DISABLE= tar -cf a2.tar a;tar -tf a2.tar a /code/pre  <comment126462> Thanks! This is indeed a very interesting answer! I will let it rest for a while, and if no one else gives another answer soon, then I will accept. <comment126483> I am accepting because otherwise I will forget it. Thanks again for sharing the alias! : )
