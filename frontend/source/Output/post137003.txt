Filtering a photo of a document to look like a proper scan <body> So there are a couple of iOS apps that "scan" documents and automatically do some processing to make the image look like a quality scan from a real scanner.  When I'm trying this on the Mac with pictures from a DSLR manually with Photoshop the results are usually not as good as what these apps achieve.  Therefore I'm looking for either a Mac app or instructions for Photoshop on how to achieve this. Or maybe even an Automator script.  Just to be clear: I do not need OCR!  <answer137004> You can use strongScanTailor/strong.     Scan Tailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages. It performs operations such as page splitting, deskewing, adding/removing borders, and others. You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be printed or assembled into a PDF or DJVU file.   Whilst it's not available natively on OS X, the exe works perfectly with any recent versions of Wine.  <comment162676> I do not know "wine" other then as a alcoholic drink. <comment163030> @Buscarì›ƒ Wine allows you to run Windows executables on Unix-like platforms (including OS X). http://wiki.winehq.org/MacOSX
