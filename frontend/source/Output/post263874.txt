How to present a keynote and start playing itunes music <body> When I am in that full-screen mode presenting a keynote, using the iTunes media keys seems to just exit the keynote instead of playing a song from iTunes.  How can I play a song from iTunes whilst staying inside the keynote presenter?  <answer263913> Keynote can play audio across all slides, but it needs to be inserted differently. Rather than using the Media button to insert audio you need to insert your audio via the Document icon and then click the Audio tab, and drop your audio tracking this way.   This audio then becomes a "Soundtrack" and will play across all slides in the presentation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NuvI8.png" alt="Keynote, document settings"  <answer264028> Using Automator, AppleScript and a Keyboard Shortcut it is possible.  ol liOpen Automator/li liCreate a new Service action/li liMake sure it receives 'no input' at all programs./li liDrop a 'Run AppleScript' action in/li liAdd this code: /li /ol  codetell application "iTunes"    play track "name-of-song-you-want-to-play" end tell/code  ol start="6" liSave Automator Service Action/li liOpen System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Services/li liAt the bottom under 'General' you will find the action you just created/li liSelect that item/li liPush the 'Add Shortcut' button/li liPress the shortcut you want to use, for example Alt + CMD X/li /ol  When you are in fullscreen mode and arrive at slide 3. Just press the shortcut you chose. And voila the music will start.  <comment330649> You can add the music you want to play to the slide <comment330650> @Peter it needs to go across slides <comment330665> I don't want audio across all slides, just from the third slide onwards. <comment330669> Okay could you update your question with this new information? <comment330671> could you please answer the question I asked? I never even asked about putting music into Keynote. <comment330678> I think you can do it with AppleScript... <comment330867> "add this code" - inside the template of do I make the whole file that code? <comment330868> Inside the Run AppleScript part inside Automator. No separate file needed.
