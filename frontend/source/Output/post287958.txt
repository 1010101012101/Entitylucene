Why is my message app not sorting by recent message? <body> Ever since I had a storage issue, my messages app no longer puts new messages at the top of the messages list.   When i get a message from someone , sms or imessage it is added to their conversation whereever that person happens to be in the list rather than moving to the top which it used to do.  Have I accidentally put on a setting? If so can I turn it off?  <comment363567> Did you maybe change time, language or region settings? <comment363568> No, but thanks for the suggestion.  Took a look just incase but all normal
