How to delete all my progress in Fruit Ninja? <body> I would like to reset all my progress, achievements and objects from strongFruit Ninja/strong. I've tried deleting it and then reinstalling it again, but I still have all my stuff.   So, how could I reset the game so that it's like I've never played before?  <answer136424> When deleting the app, you are prompted if you want to remove the app data from Game Center.  img src="https://d74bwl3dcueqd.cloudfront.net/images/guide/8aee506afc014a77bfec06b81378d338/640x960.jpg" width="320"  Choosing Remove will remove this data and subsequently reinstalling the app will start a fresh container for the app data.  <comment161801> So you basically you want to start over? <comment161802> Yeah :/ basically <comment161803> did you enable the HalfBrick account? You could do a factory reset which removes all progress from your device. <comment161805> I dont have a halfbrick account. Does that matter? Also, a factory reset might be troublesome. :/ like really troublesome <comment161834> ...don't login to game center? <comment161858> I tried this as well as downloading the game when I wasn't logged into game center. It doesnt seem to work. I might try a reset :( <comment161859> Don't answer your own question in the question â€” write it in an answer. <comment206180> Won't that just remove it from being seen in Game Center? <comment206222> @TreScaggs No, games can store a variety of key-value pairs besides public leaderboards in Game Center.
