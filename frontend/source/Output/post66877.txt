10.8.2 Finder windows: number of files in folder? <body> I just upgraded to 10.8. Finder windows used to show me how many files were in a folder; where is that info now? Apple didn't get rid of it completely, did they?  Please tell me I don't have to manually count files now!  <answer66879> I guess the status bar was just hidden. You can show it by checking Show Status Bar from the View menu.  <comment78763> that was it, thanks!!!
