MBP - have to re-enable Wi-Fi every 30 mins <body> I have a MacBook Pro running on El Capitan (but the issue was already present before the upgrade, so it's not related). I have the Mac since a bit less than a year. It is still running perfectly but since a couple of weeks, the internet is really weird. It's constantly completely blocked and just not working. The wifi works well: on my iPhone it is never down, but every 30min or so, it just blocks while I am browsing (but the issue is there on all the apps used, from Xcode to my FTP client, and so on), and it doesn't work anymore. When I just turn the wifi off and on again, it works well for some time, and then the issue comes back again.  I tried changing the DNS (by using this software that indicates the fastest DNS to use) and I thought it worked at first, but the issues are back again.  I have tried deleting the wifi from my keychain and adding it again the problem is persisting.  Obviously I have restarted the modem a couple of times too, no difference.  Any advice?  <answer215082> You can run a Cron action who turn on/off your wifi connection every 30 minutes ;)  strongTurn Wifi Off/strong  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off /code/pre  strongTurn Wifi On/strong  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on /code/pre  http://blog.mattcrampton.com/post/64144666914/managing-wifi-connections-using-the-mac-osx  strongSchedule a Cron task :/strong  http://benr75.com/pages/using_crontab_mac_os_x_unix_linux  Edit : Ohh sorry I was thinking that you wanted to turn on/off your wifi every 30 minutes :/ However, if you don't find a solution...  <comment259807> Cron on OSX?
