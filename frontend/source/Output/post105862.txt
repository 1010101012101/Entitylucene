Hidden folder without a dot at the start <body> On any unix machine, Mac included, files and folders with dots at the start are normally invisible. However, it seems that the Mac has it's own type of hidden folder.  If I enable showing hidden files in Finder (codedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code), there are 70 dotfiles in my home directory. However, there are two hidden folder without dots: codeTrash/code and codeLibrary/code. In the root directory, there are several (codelost+found/code, codebin/code, codecores/code, etcâ€¦).  Is it possible to make one of these folders that is hidden in Finder while keeping it's path the same (AKA not adding a dot)? I use a utility that needs a code~/tmp/code folder, and I'd love to hide it in finder.  <answer105863> You can use codechflags/code  To hide a file from Finder  precodechflags hidden /Path/To/File /code/pre  To unhide:  precodechflags nohidden /Path/To/File /code/pre  <comment124461> Awesome, thanks! <comment124466> Also, the `ls -lO` command will show file flags, including the hidden flag.
