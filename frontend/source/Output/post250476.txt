"Picture" folder basically empty, shows ~47GB usage <body> I have spent the entire day trying to resolve my 88GB "Other" problem (it is down some now).   I discovered that my "Picture" folder, while basically empty, is ~47GB.  In the folder is an empty photo booth library, and that is it.   What are these phantom 47?  <comment311056> Do you see this 47GB from quicklook/get info or from the Storage menu in About This Mac? <comment311252> Have you emptied your trash? Have you tried going into your Pictures folder, and all sub-folders and right-clicking and choosing *Arrange by name* to move any files into view? <comment312494> Use something like [DaisyDisk](http://daisydiskapp.com/) and you'll be able to see exactly where the storage is being used.
