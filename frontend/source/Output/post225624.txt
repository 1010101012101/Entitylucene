Keyboard layout grayed out? <body> I tried installing the Logitech keyboard layout using this guide.  It appears in the Language Menu, so I added it as a possible layout, but it is grayed out in the Input menu so I can't switch to it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WTnyK.png" alt="Input menu with grayed out layout"  I am using OS X El Capitan 10.11.3. I downloaded the Logitech layout file from their website, version 3.9.3.  Any idea what the cause of this could be and what I can do to make it work? I have no idea what else to search for to fix this issue.  <comment273862> Did the layout file you tried to install have .keylayout at the end of its name? <comment273886> Hmm nope, it had a rsrc at the end of its name. That's what the guide said to copy over? <comment273895> It might work better just to install the .keylayout file.  I can send you one if you want (tom at bluesky dot org)
