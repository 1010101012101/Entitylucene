How to record/stream iPhone 4 screen with iOS 7? <body> I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 7 and I want to record the screen from the device, or stream the screen of the device on my MacBook Pro and record it with QuickTime.  How can I do that?  supI have AirServer, but it works only with iPhone 4s+! No jailbreak on my device./sup  <answer112688> You could try reflector, it emulates apple tv so you get your iphone screen on your mac. search Reflector on google.  <answer112692> Unfortunately the use of such software has a pre-requisite of emAirPlay Mirroring/em, which is not supported by an iPhone 4 at any OS level, hence teh requirement for an iPhone 4s minimum.  If you had a device that supports it, then it's pretty straightforward (take a look at this answer elswhere on AskDifferent) but with an iPhone 4, you are out of luck unless someone can suggest a way of enabling it with a Jailbreak hack.  <comment132297> I already tried reflector. According to [compatible devices' page](http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/compatible-devices/) iphone 4 is not supported. Thanks for your answer. <comment132302> For clarity, the compatibility issues do not stem from the software, but from the hardware, as such all similar software will have exactly the same issue. <comment132303> Therefore for iPhone 4 without jailbreak there aren't possibilites to share screen to computers/mac? thanks for your reply
