Waiting until a window exists in Applescript? <body> I'm trying to work with the script below and the coderepeat until exists window "Print"/codeloop never returns true (I never hear the beep 3). Is this the correct way to wait for a window to appear?   I am using the Accessibility Inspector and this is the correct name of the print dialog window.  precode# Saves current document open in EverNote as PDF # activate application "Evernote" tell application "System Events"     tell process "EverNote"         # Open the print dialog         beep 1         keystroke "p" using command down          # Wait until the Print dialog opens before proceeding         repeat until exists window "Print"         end repeat          # Expand the "PDF" menu button (must be expanded before the menu is referencable)         beep 3          click menu button "PDF" of window "Print"         # Wait until the Menu button menu is created before proceeding         repeat until exists menu item "Save as PDF…" of menu 1 of menu button "PDF" of window "Print"         end repeat         # Select the "Save as PDF" menu item         click menu item "Save as PDF…" of menu 1 of menu button "PDF" of window "Print"          # Wait until the Save dialog opens before proceeding         repeat until exists window "Save"         end repeat          # Paste the contents of the clipboard in and Save         # This is sorta hack; Probably best to leave the 'Save As" dialog open and let the user finish it off but I have a special purpose         if (get (the clipboard) is not "") then             set value of text field 1 of window "Save" to get (the clipboard) &amp; ".pdf"         end if         click button "Save" of window "Save"      end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer121855> I seem to have fixed the main problem of the "waiting for window" issue. Apparently nested "tells" are not so good - so I solved this by specifying the process which owns a particular UI element:  precoderepeat until window "Print" of process "Evernote" exists /code/pre  Haven't solved putting the current date into the filename field of the "Save" sheet yet but tomorrow is another day! Here's the full script:  precodeactivate application "Evernote" tell application "System Events"      # Open the print dialog     keystroke "p" using command down      # Wait until the Print dialog opens before proceeding     repeat until window "Print" of process "Evernote" exists     end repeat      click menu button "PDF" of window "Print" of process "Evernote"      # Wait until the Menu button menu is created before proceeding     repeat until exists menu item "Save as PDF…" of menu 1 of menu button "PDF" of window "Print" of process "Evernote"     end repeat      # Select the "Save as PDF" menu item     click menu item "Save as PDF…" of menu 1 of menu button "PDF" of window "Print" of process "Evernote"      # Wait until the Save dialog opens before proceeding     repeat until exists window "Save" of process "Evernote"     end repeat      set theDate to current date      #tell (current date) to get (it's month as integer) &amp; "-" &amp; day &amp; "-" &amp; (it's year as integer)     #set the clipboard to result as text      #set myDate to result as text     #set the clipboard to "dog" as text     #if (get (the clipboard) is not "") then     #set value of text field 1 of sheet "Save" of process "Evernote" to get (the clipboard) &amp; ".pdf"     #end if      set value of text field of sheet "Save" of process "Evernote" to "dog" &amp; ".pdf"     # Paste the contents of the clipboard in and Save     # This is sorta hack; Probably best to leave the 'Save As" dialog open and let the user finish it off but I have a special purpose      # click button "Save" of window "Save" of process "Evernote"   end tell /code/pre  <comment177038> I have also used `tell application "System Events" to tell process "MyProcess" ... blah` with some success. <comment345083> Does repeat until window "Print" of process "Evernote" exists really work for you? When I try exact that line I get a compilation error pointing at " before Evernote "Expected end of line but found “"”." <comment345084> @d-b – was a couple of years ago so I don't really recall – but I think, yeah, it did work.
