install: illegal option -- D <body> In linux the command install has these options (among others): (from the man page)  precode-d, --directory           treat all arguments as directory names; create all components of the specified directories  -D     create all leading components of DEST except the last, then copy SOURCE to DEST /code/pre  On the mac manage there is this option:  precode-d      Create directories.  Missing parent directories are created as required. /code/pre  I am attempting to install a library using a makefile and am getting this error on the mac:  precodeinstall: illegal option -- D /code/pre  This is caused by the command install being used to copy a .h file.  Would the code-d/code option work the same?  Or is there a way to do this that would work on both platforms?  <answer201030> The lowercase "d" should work. If it doesn't, you can install GNU install with Homebrew coreutils which will provide the "D" flag.
