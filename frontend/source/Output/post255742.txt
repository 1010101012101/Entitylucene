Sleuth Kit Autopsy won't run <body> I am trying to install Autopsy on my macbook but I cannot get the application running. I followed the instructions from this site:     ol   liPress Command+Space and type Terminal and press enter/return key./li   liRun in Terminal app:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" &lt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null /code/pre      and press enter/return key. Wait for the command to finish./li   liRun:  precodebrew install autopsy /code/pre/li   /ol   How do I open the application and get it up and running for Mac?   <answer271962> I had this same issue; there doesn't seem to be any documentation on how to actually run the software. Just type "autopsy" into the terminal.  <comment318638> What happens when you try to run it? What logs/errors does it generate? We can't look over your shoulder and see what happens.
