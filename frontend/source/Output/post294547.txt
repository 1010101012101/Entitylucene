Stopping "wants to make changes" password prompts on secondary account when performing admin tasks <body> I have a secondary user account that I use for work. Both my primary account and this one are set to Admin.  When installing software updates (and in other instances that require higher privileges) while logged in on my secondary account, macOS will ask me for my secondary account's password.   This does not happen on my primary account, and I wish for it to stop happening on my secondary account too.  How can I make macOS stop asking for my secondary account's password every time a change needs to be made?
