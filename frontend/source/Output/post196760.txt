If iOS's filesystem is case-sensitive then why can't I save a.pages and A.pages? <body> When I try to save document in Pages.app on iOS with the same name but a different case I get:   precode"a" is already taken. Please choose a different name. /code/pre  I would expect that this would work if iOS is case-sensitive.  <answer197586> HFS+ is not case-sensitive.  It is, however, case-preserving.  Your problem is not a problem, it is working as designed.  <comment235119> I'd have to say with that error message, under the circumstances, it's obviously not case sensitive. <comment235122> is it set to save/handoff over iCloud to a Mac? That might make it double-check for compatibility, as the Mac isn't case-sensitive by default. You're right that iOS **is** natively HFSX <comment235273> See also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15121210/how-can-i-read-write-and-check-case-insensitive-filenames-in-ios <comment236253> The iOS file system is case-sensitive- HFSX .
