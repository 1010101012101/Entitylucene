Can't find xtreamer sidewinder 2 airplay on my network <body> I have a xtreamer sidewinder 2 and it has a feature for airplay, however i cannot find it on my macbook or ipad pro. I have scanned its ip to check for ports open and it seems it is turned on (the aiplay). I was wondering if the airplay protocol has changed recently, as it used to work with iphone a couple of years ago? Is there anything i can try to make the connection?
