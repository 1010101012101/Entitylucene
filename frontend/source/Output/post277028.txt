Lock screen sharing to one screen only <body> I use Microsoft Lync (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_for_Business) to share my screen. Is it possible to share a desktop screen but prevent other desktop screens being shared ? So if present my desktop and switch screens and I want to prevent viewers of my desktop from viewing the desktop I have switched to.  For example I share my Desktop1, when I move to Desktop2 can users that are viewing my Desktop1 screen not have ability to view Desktop2 screen, so they are locked in viewing Desktop1 screen.  Alternatively can the screen be split so that just one half is viewable and apps view half of screen as a desktop ?
