Time Machine failing: "an error occurred while copying files" <body> As of 1/1/2017, my Time Machine backups are failing with the following message:     strongTime Machine couldn't complete the backup to "WDMyCloud"./strong An error occurred while copying files. The problem may be temporary. If the problem persists, use Disk Utility to repair your backup disk.   The drive itself is a 3TB Western Digital My Cloud NAS. I can mount it in the Finder and it seems to be okay (in that I can browse it and open files), but it doesn't appear in Disk Utility at all, which doesn't seem right...  I ran the full diagnostics test in WD's utilities (it exposes a page at wdmycloud.local when the drive is powered on) and it reported no problems.  I've tried restarting both the drive and my MacBook Pro, which didn't help.  Is this a fixable problem, or is my drive dying? I'd be surprised if it's the latter, since it's less than three years old, sits untouched next to my router in a well-ventilated area, and again the diagnostics reported no issues.  <answer267808> If the myCloud is a network-connected drive, it won't appear in Disk Utility. Only locally connected drives appear there. As per this answer on Apple's forum site, the way to check your hard drive for errors is to connect it directly to your Mac using USB, FireWire or Thunderbolt. Then you can repair or erase it with Disk Utility. If this hard-wire connection is not an option, you may want to consider erasing the old backup and creating a new backup.  <comment336108> Yes, it's a NAS – I didn't realize it wouldn't show up in Disk Utility, thanks! Maybe then this is just a Time Machine issue and the disk itself is fine. I'll see if I can find a USB cable while the diagnostic thing is running...
