Concatenate not working in Numbers <body> Sample numbers file  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T6bbN.png" alt="enter image description here"  B4 contains codeCONCATENATE(B2,B3)/code  In the file above, I am getting syntax error on B4, despite the formula seems correct. Can anyone reproduce the problem? How can I solve it?  MacBook Air, OS X Yosemite (10.10.5), Numbers version: 3.6.1 (2566)  <answer235150> Some locales use semicolon as a separator for parameters in formulae, such as Turkey. You can check this by using a comma after the first parameter, then clicking a cell. If you see a semicolon being inserted alongside the comma you should use a semicolon as a delimiter.                                  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IXKd.png" width="363"  strikeThis feels like a bug. Copy-pasting the cell shows the syntax error, but copy-pasting the emcontents/em of the cell (the formula itself) works fine, alongside me retyping the formula. You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/numbers.html/strike/li /ul  <comment287596> I managed the make it work. Instead of putting comma as the separator of arguments, putting semicolon worked. But were you able to make it work using comma? <comment287597> @Utku Yes, what locale is your computer set to? <comment287598> I don't know. Where can I check it? <comment287599> @Utku System Preferences → Language & Region <comment287600> Yep. Region shows Turkey. So this might be the reason? <comment287601> @Utku Yep, I've just set my locale to Turkey and I reproduce the problem exactly. I've rewritten my answer. <comment287604> I wonder what might be the purpose of such design.
