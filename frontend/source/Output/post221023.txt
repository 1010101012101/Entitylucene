How can I remove iCloud data for a specific app <body> I want to delete Pixel Gun 3D status but it is apparently saved to iCloud.  I have tried deleting the app and reinstalling but it kept the game's data.  How can completely delete and reinstall the app as new with no previous data?  <answer221027> As detailed in Apple's support article,   ul liGo to Settings  iCloud  Storage  Manage Storage (on your device)/li liTap on the app's name, Pixel Gun 3D and tap "Delete Data"/li /ul  This is for an iOS device, which I am assuming you are using. Mac instructions are detailed on the Apple Support article.  <comment267589> It doesn't make any sense so I edited your post to indicate that the game data _is_ stored in iCloud. Perhaps you need to contact the developer and find _where_ they store the data and edit the post so that we could help you remove it from where it's stored...
