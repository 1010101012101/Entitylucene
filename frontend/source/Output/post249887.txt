Split View same app twice? <body> Is it possible to view 2 apps at the same, eg. 2 Ã— Mail, in Split View?  <answer249888> strongThis is not possible in iOS 9./strong Only one instance of an app can run at any given time.  There is a small change in iOS 10 allowing two instances of strongSafari/strong to run concurrently, but that is a special case. To do that, long-press a link, and select codeOpen in Split View/code.  <answer249892> This can be done only on a newer strongiPad/strong or strongiPhone 6 Plus/strong. running strongiOS 9 or higher/strong.  You will notice that these apps are not contained into 1 app, they are each running independently of the other.  You can view each app and interact with each app but they can't communicate with each other (other than what's already allowed by the app itself).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eu4y6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment310146> This does not answer the poster's question. They know how to use Split View, but they don't know how to use the same app in two Split View windows. <comment310147> Apparently, it does work on [tag:macOS] (I'm using Sierra beta one) with any app, not just Safari. <comment310150> Right, but the question is tagged iPad and iOS 9.
