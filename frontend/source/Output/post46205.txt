iPhone 4 battery life on Wifi all day <body> I want to ask what is the average life of your iPhone 4 running iOS 5, with Wifi turn on, and what you are doing is just surfing through Safari. I'm getting 1 percent decrease every 3 minutes.   <answer46207> When actively browsing, that's not unusual.  1% every three minutes is 5 hours, which is expected if you've got the display on and using the wifi for browsing.  If it dropped 1% every three minutes with the display off, then you're likely running a background process that uses wifi and/or the GPS (turn by turn directions, running tracker, online streaming music, etc).  <comment52738> Is it jailbroken? Have you tried a hard reset? Does the advice in [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/45597/3117) (and comments) help at all? <comment52756> Yes its jailbroke . In fact it is freshly installed <comment52911> So in ur iphone4, you can browse for5 hrs straight? Tnx
