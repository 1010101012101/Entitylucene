iMovie export to Ogg Theora? <body> After I finish editing a movie with iMovie '09 under Mac OS X 10.6.4, is there a way to export the final product to Ogg Theora format? OR, is there a way to convert an already exported movie to Ogg Theora easily?  <answer1030> As part of Dive Into HTML5, Mark Pilgrim gives two options:  ul liEncoding Ogg Video With Firefogg/li liBatch Encoding Ogg Video With ffmpeg2theora/li /ul  One or both of those should work for you.  <answer30935> Just install the XiphQT Quicktime plugin... allows any of the Quicktime-based OS X video players/editors, including iMovie, to export to Theora.  <comment877> Aha! Thank you!!! <comment82798> These links are dead...
