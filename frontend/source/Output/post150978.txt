What is the relationship between Xcode and Xcode command line tools <body> When I install Xcode from App Store, I can compile programs in Xcode as well as command line too. Several command line utilities like codeclang/code, codemake/code and codegit/code all become available when Xcode.app is installed. So I thought that the separate package of command line tools are only for those who do not want a full IDE installed.  But to my surprise, one of the linking problems I encountered when compiling MacVim can be successfully solved by installing the command line tools with codexcode-select --install/code. So apparently the Xcode.app and the command line tools differ, at least in subtle ways. What is the difference then? Does the latter have better coverage for all the essentials for programming than the former?  Currently I am using Xcode 6.0.1 on Mavericks.  <answer150980> You can see it as:  ul liThe command line tools are the basic foundation. Many basic tools are needed to compile your Swift/Objective-C code./li liXCode is the IDE which brings a few additional packages with it. /li /ul     So the command line tools get sure that the basic UNIX tools are   covered (as GCC for example) to be able to compile and link code.   Xcode then is using those basic tools.  hr  From the documents:  strongWhat is the Command Line Tools Package?/strong     The Command Line Tools Package is a small self-contained package   available for download separately from Xcode and that allows you to do   command line development in OS X. It consists of two components: OS X   SDK and command-line tools such as Clang, which are installed in   /usr/bin.   <comment177644> But apparently Xcode.app comes with its own command line tools such as `clang`, `git`, `make` as well. Why is installing another copy of these tools necessary to compile some software? <comment177650> Why apparently? Git and make are additional tools which are not included in the "basic" Command line tools. <comment177653> `git`, `make` are all in the directory `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin` so they are, indeed, included in the "basic" command line tools.
