Is Soundflower 1.6.6 compatible with Mavericks 10.9? <body> Is Soundflower 1.6.6 compatible with Mavericks 10.9?  <answer112129> I just tried installing Soundflower 1.6.6 on 10.9 and it does still work. I don't know if there are some compatibility issues, but if there were some major issues they'd probably have released a new version already.  <answer112171> If you check on RoaringApps you can see that Soundflower works fine on Mavericks. However, there's only one report stating that, so depending on your hardware configuration you might have a different experience.  <answer115441> The best answer is Yes and No, it works completely but it causes lag when changing the volume.  It can also send pretty cad digital to other apps so better to go without for that and use JackOSX.  <answer116062> at first I thought that no, doesn't work for me.  deeper investigation revealed that indeed it does work but somehow Mavericks install set the volume to 0, means all the streams were nullified. I spent at least 2h fighting this issue and finally found the setting in system Audio Devices (not system preferences)  <answer119214> I finally found that Soundflower has to be selected as both input and output for it to work properly in Quicktime screen recordings. Once I figured that out, it worked excellently.  <answer123084> Sorry to be the first negative, but for me it does not work. Soundflower itself is working, but Soundflowerbed keeps crashing as soon as you want to change any settings. Konsole gives this information:  precodeApplication Specific Information: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSRangeException', reason: '*** -[__NSArrayM objectAtIndex:]: index 16 beyond bounds [0 .. 15]' terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException abort() called /code/pre  There's a lot more on that error report regarding several .dylibs, but mainly thats it. Probably has to do with upgrading from SnowLeopard instead of using a fresh install. So if you want to upgrade the same way (SL  MAV directly) be warned: If you had a working Soundflower installation on SL do not try to upgrade to 1.6.6b, it's not going to work. Just stay with whatever you have, it's running fine.  Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't do anything to solve the problem. At least i recreated SOundflower 1.4.4 and the according .kext file from a TimeMachine Backup which works fine now.  <answer129889> Just wanted to chime in. I use SimCap with Soundflower a lot to make demo videos of apps and I haven't been able to get audio to work at all since upgrading to Mavericks. When I've tried SoundFlower with other apps I get similar results. I have both input and output selected for Soundflower in the "Sound" section of System Preferences and both are set to about mid-volume.   <answer130296> I just fixed the latest code from cycling74's github (1.6.7) to build it and run it on Mavericks.  You can get it at https://github.com/crmne/Soundflower/releases  <answer144743> Just use an old version of SoundFlower (for example SoundFlower 1.6.5) on Mavericks.  <answer146664> No - Soundflower has quit working for me in 10.9.5 using 1.6.7 version of Soundcloud.  Worked before in Mavericks but now has a lot of audio feedback.  When channeling clive, you can't understand what people are saying.    I use it sometimes to record a video that is on screen with Quicktime.  <answer180335> 1.6.7 does not work in OS X 10.10.2. It crashes on start up with:  precodeException Type:        EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT) Exception Codes:       0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Invalid parameter not satisfying: (index &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (index &lt; [_itemArray count])' terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException abort() called /code/pre  <comment131707> According to [RoaringApps](http://roaringapps.com/app/soundflower) it should work. <comment131724> @BartArondson you should post that as an answer to the question, not a comment. It's technically the most correct answer. Should get the green checkmark. <comment131738> @IanC. Ok, will do. I just felt that Lri's answer already answered it pretty well, so another answer stating the same would not add much I thought. <comment136542> THANK YOU for this! I've been banging my head against this issue for far too long under Mountain Lion, as have apparently dozens of other people, and there's all sorts of crazy going on in the forums. Who knew it could be as simple as "check the master fader"! (For future visitors, the place to look is /Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup, in the Audio window.) <comment152108> Hi and welcome to Ask Different.
