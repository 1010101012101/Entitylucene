I don't know why my retina MacbookPro keeps crashing and how to fix <body> My mid2014 retina pro keeps crashing, can't boot into safe mode and can't choose utilities when booting into recovery mode because no mouse commands are accepted. (not sure what key combo would choose a utility such as disk recovery) it resolves itself over time--not sure how.    I Kept the log from last night's crash == 92 pages so i tried to post what might be relevant but i really have no idea.  Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance  precode12/10/14 6:24:28.000 PM kernel[0] BUG in process suhelperd[305]: over-released legacy external boost assertions (1 total, 1 external, 0 legacy-external)    12/10/14 6:24:24.836 PM com.apple.audio.DriverHelper[202]   The plug-in named AirPlay.driver requires extending the sandbox for the IOKit user-client class IGAccelVideoContextMain.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Note:  there are 6 of these with different devices 12/10/14 6:24:27.000 PM kernel[0]   Sandbox: appleeventsd(26) deny file-read-metadata /Library 12/10/14 6:24:27.000 PM kernel[0]   Sandbox: appleeventsd(26) deny mach-lookup com.apple.ocspd 12/10/14 6:24:28.000 PM kernel[0]   USBF:    9.686    The IOUSBFamily was not able to enumerate a device. 12/10/14 6:24:28.739 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.imtransferservices.IMTransferAgent) The _DirtyJetsamPriority key is not available on this platform. 12/10/14 6:24:28.739 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.imtransferservices.IMTransferAgent) The _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform. 12/10/14 6:24:28.740 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform. 12/10/14 6:24:28.763 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform. 12/10/14 6:24:28.847 PM logind[70]  -[SessionManager getClient:withRole:inAuditSession:]:241: ERROR: No session dictionary for audit session 100014 12/10/14 6:24:28.847 PM logind[70]  _SMGetSessionAgent:73: ERROR: __SMGetClientForAuditSessionAgent failed 2 12/10/14 6:24:28.000 PM kernel[0]   BUG in process suhelperd[305]: over-released legacy external boost assertions (1 total, 1 external, 0 legacy-external) 12/10/14 6:24:29.289 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.google.keystone.daemon[317]) Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch(3) APIs.

If you still can't use your mouse after it fully boots into this mode, then there's likely a hardware issue.  Some computers don't natively support Internet Recovery, so be sure to check out this Apple support article.  But strongembefore/em/strong you try any of the above serious fixes, try reseting the PRAM and SMC on your computer.  <answer161412> This is a strongDiagnostic/strong not a repair  Following might show what is making it crush.  Copy/Paste the following in to your Terminal (located in the utility folder).  precodesyslog -k Sender kernel -k Message CSeq 'n Cause: -' | tail | awk '/:/{$4=""; print}' | pbcopy /code/pre  The output will be copied to your clip board.  <comment188624> I found a discussion page that talks about your issue, check it out [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6639647). <comment188654> This sounds promising, thank you for your response.  When pasting into terminal and then keying Command+V to text editor, i didn't get any output however? <comment188657> If you do not get output then there was nothing to report. <comment189593> That thread suggests that Software update is the culprit. bThe suhelperd is related to the App Store and Software Update. When I open the appStore and check update I get hundreds of `kernel[0]: BUG in process suhelperd[289]: over-released legacy external boost assertions (1 total, 1 external, 0 legacy-external)`. I am Not getting the behaviour you are getting But I do think it is in the right direction for those that are.
