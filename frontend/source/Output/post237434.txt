Google Chrome won't open URL files by double click <body> I recently tried to open a URL link I saved onto my desktop by double clicking it, but it will not open correctly. If I DRAG &amp; DROP the file into chrome works fine.   The code of the file is as follows:  precode[InternetShortcut] URL=https://www.textnow.com/login /code/pre  the file is saved with a ".url" extension  If I double click on the file I'm prompted by finder to choose which application to open it with (Chrome is greyed out, but I choose 'All Applications' and then choose Chrome), it will then simply load a page in Chrome and display the code on the page, instead of opening the url specified in the code.   running Version 50.0.2661.94 (64-bit) on OSX 10.9.5  <answer237440> OK did some digging around. It turns out that Google Chrome's security model normally doesn't allow clicking on code.url/code files to open them.   There is a Chrome extension that will allow this though so the solution is easy for OSX users.  <answer237442> This is a known issue with Google Chrome. See:Chrome doesn't recognise .url files properly  The workaround it to use an Extension such as .URL Handler  Once installed you need to go to Chrome  Preferences...  Extensions (chrome://extensions/) and check the [âœ”] Allow access to file URLs check box.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u0EWr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer295391> Although this is problem for BROWSER (not Apple) I will add solution for strongWindows too/strong:  Open codeStart&gt;Settings&gt;System&gt;Default apps/code and check that codeGoogle Chrome/code is chosen under Web Browser. Also open up codeChoose default apps by file type/code, scroll down to .url file and choose "Internet Browser"  next to it.  <comment290816> I made a `.url` file using your example and get the same results as you. <comment290819> IS there a similar feature for Ubuntu ? These Chrome extenstions do not work on Ubuntu <comment290821> @Kalamalka Kid, I haven't looked to see about Ubuntu as this forum is for Apple stuff.  Stack Exchange has an [Ask Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com) forum too.
