Will an iPhone only activate using the SIM card that it was originally activated with? <body> I read this question and was wondering if I need to have a SIM card that has previously activated an iPhone in order to activate an iPhone.  I'm inheriting my mother's old 3Gs to use as an iPod / for development purposes, and I was wondering if when I restore it to factory settings I'll need her old SIM card to activate it.   <answer50181> No - any valid SIM from the correct carrier will activate a phone that is locked to one carrier.   In the rarer case - iPhone 3G was sold or is now authorized unlocked in which case, you don't need any SIM to activate the device after a restore operation.  If the device is carrier locked (in the US - AT&amp;T is the likely carrier), you can either buy a valid SIM from the correct carrier. A prepaid line or locating the SIM that was last used to activate the phone are good options for low expense.   Apple has articles that can guide you in this process:  ul liUsing an iPhone without a wireless service plan - This covers setting up an old iPhone like an iPod touch./li liiOS: How to back up your data and set up as a new device - The end of this covers restore, set up as new and more explanation of carrier plans./li liAbout swapping the SIM card/li liiPhone: Troubleshooting authorized unlock issues/li /ul  <comment57510> I think the device it likely to be unlocked as it was bought in the middle east. <comment57515> Excellent - you don't need a sim then to activate the device. I'll link two more articles so the main answer is more complete <comment57519> Of course - the best course of action is to inherit the SIM along with the phone - the person giving the phone can usually ask the carrier for a new SIM or ensure it's no longer billing to their account and you can use the old SIM and phone without needing service. <comment57564> Sadly my mother has already switched to a 4S and has had her SIM card cut to fit her new phone...
