How can I easily indent a block in any textarea on OS X? <body> Are there shortcut keys or another quick way to indent a text block at once in a normal text area on OS X?  So that I can easily turn:  precode[I want this to indent. For formatting. It's several lines.] /code/pre  Into:  precode    [I want this to indent.     For formatting.     It's several lines.] /code/pre  <answer140679> You want to edit text, and for that you need a text editor. There is (easy) native way in OS X to do these kind of text manipulations.  I personally use BBEdit/TextWrangler for these kind of codings. kbdcommand/kbdkbd]/kbd  You can also use Automator to create a Service and use sed/regex to do the 'hard' lifting: (and bind a keystroke to this Service)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAuWY.png" alt="automator"  codesed 's/\(^.*\)/\ \ \ \ \1/g'/code:  emsed can be used to edit lines of text. In this line sed globally substitutes a match of 'the beginning of a line and everything that comes after it' with '4 spaces and that match'./em  <comment165770> What about the Cocoa Text System, couldn't that be used to provide a custom shortcut for an indent command? <comment165772> Nice thought, it might be possible to do that, though I have no clue how ;) It is a clean way to do it though.
