How to maximize file transfer speeds? <body> We're trying to transfer large files from NY to LA, from one Mac to another.  Both sites have 100/100 mbps internet. Both report full speed at www.speedtest.net.  But we've tried AFP, SMB and SFTP, and can't get it to go any faster than 20mbps.  Tested with codeiperf/code -- with parallel connections got up to 16-20 mbps.  However, we are doing this over a LogMeIn Hamachi VPN. Does that throttle/limit the speed?  <answer169011> Using lftp with codesftp/code and codepget -cn10/code I was able to get the transfer up to 99 mbps!  <comment198435> I tested SFTP without using Hamachi, and it still caps out at 20mbps.
