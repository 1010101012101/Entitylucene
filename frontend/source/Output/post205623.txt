Default to ActiveSync for Exchange Calendar <body> Even though I have Exchange ActiveSync set up in my iPhone 6 settings, when I create a new appointment it defaults to iPhone calendar instead. How do I set the ActiveSync calendar as the default?  <answer205625> Choose a default calendar in strongSettings/strong → strongMail, Contacts &amp; Calendars/strong → strongDefault Calendar/strong (right at the bottom).
