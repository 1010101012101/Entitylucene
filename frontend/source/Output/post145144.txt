CMD + arrow goes to beginning of line , conflicts with Sublime <body> I am trying to use cmd+left/right to do "focus to group" in Sublime, but my cursor goes to the beginning/end of line instead.  Note that I'm using a PC keyboard.. and I've remapped the modifiers (Super=CMD,CTRL=CMD).  <answer145149> kbd Command ï£¿ /kbd + kbd Arrow /kbd is the system standard for 'beginning/end of line'.   This gives a good way to remap key bindings... Remap &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;End&quot; to beginning and end of line
