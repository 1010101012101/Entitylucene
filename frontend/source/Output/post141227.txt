Get notified on new App Reviews? <body> Does anyone know of a solution (app or site) that will automatically notify me anytime I get a review on one of my iOS apps?  <answer141233> Apple provides an strongRSS/strong you can subscribe to. You can find it by doing the following:  ol liGo to strongiTunes Connect/strong and log in/li liGo to strongManage your Apps/strong and select the App you're interested in/li liUnder strongLinks/strong, in the strongApp Information/strong section, you'll find the strongCustomer Reviews/strong/li liOpening it will display all of the customer reviews, filtered by country./li liAlongside the emcombo box/em to choose between the different countries you've already got reviews in, you'll find the RSS button./li /ol  strongNote/strong: The countries combo box and the RSS button strongwill only be displayed/strong if there are reviews already.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvPTq.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMIDv.png" alt="enter image description here"  The RSS URL looks like this:  codefeed:https://itunes.apple.com/COUNTRY-OF-THE-REVIEW/rss/customerreviews/id=APP-ID/sortBy=mostRecent/xml?l=LANGUAGE-YOU-WANT-IT-TO-BE-DISPLAYED-IN/code  <answer141858> If you prefer an email to RSS you can check out Appbot.co. I am in no way affiliated with them but have found it useful.   I get a daily email that has a summary and then each of the reviews grouped by store.  I also get a weekly email that shows all the apps I've signed up for in one email with a summary of how they are doing week over week in terms of number of reviews and stars per review.  <comment326329> I would add that if you want a feed for apps from multiple platforms (like App Store + Google Play + Windows), to use a review manager like Review Command - https://reviewcommand.co
