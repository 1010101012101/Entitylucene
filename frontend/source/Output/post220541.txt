How can I check what mode is already on on defaults write? <body> I am making a script that puts on a codedefaults write/code thing to codetrue/code. How can I check before it's it's codetrue/code or codefalse/code?  <answer220542> You can use defaults read. For example, if I wanted to check for codeAppleShowAllFiles/code, I would do:  precode~$ defaults read com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES /code/pre  Which would return codeYES/code in the stdout. You can make your script execute this command and read it from stdout.  Another perhaps unrealistic (and quite dangerous) option would be to read directly from code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.&lt;ID&gt;.plist/code, however most of then are rather unreadable. For example, codecom.apple.Finder.plist/code around the area of codeAppleShowAllFiles/code looks like this:  precodeNSNavOutlineColumnSettings.v1_FXMyDocumentsArrangeGroupViewBy_AppleShowAllFiles_ViewSettingsDictionary_CopyProgressWindowLocation_FK_StandardViewSettings_8NSTableView Hidden Columns /code/pre  This is not recommended though  <comment266947> `defaults read` ? https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/defaults.1.html <comment266948> I would say - always stick with `defaults read`. That layer is there to protect you from underlying storage changes. If Apple moves the place where they store a specific key or cache it in a database file, you will miss that if you are parsing a file from the filesystem. <comment266950> It somewhat funny you picked `AppleShowAllFiles` for your example because by default it does not exist and the output is `The domain/default pair of (com.apple.Finder, AppleShowAllFiles) does not exist` when it doesn't. :)
