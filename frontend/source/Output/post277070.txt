Text Message format to easily create event <body> I want to leverage the quick event detection feature on iOS iMessage. For example, if you text yourself:  precodeYou have a Hair Appointment at 123 Dentist St. on Thursday August 1, 2017 at 9:15AM EST with Dr. Whotim /code/pre  You will notice that strong123 Dentist St. on Thursday August 1, 2017 at 9:15AM EST/strong will be underlined. You can click it and a prefilled event creation dialog pops up. Unfortunately, your stronghair/strong appointment is confused as Dentist.  What I want to do is, find a text template that would perfectly prefill the event dialog more accurately that iOS can detect.  <comment348760> Can you change the text message to "123 Dentist St.", with quotation marks, so it treats the address as a whole instead of individual words?  I tried it and it works.
