Cant Open any file from finder accessing an Apple Airport Drive (Error -36) <body> I can't open files from finder when accessing files in an Apple Airport Drive. If I open a jpg for example in Finder I get the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s7jPP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now, if I access it not from finder, but from the actual application, in this example I open it using Preview - File / Open . The file opens with no problems. Same type of situation with text files, movies, etc.  I can access all files hosted in Mac local drive with no problems.  Also, I have a second mac that access all the files in the Airport drive from finder with no problems. Both are running El Capitan macOS.  Notice that the error points to the Host application and not to the file I am opening.  <comment338145> a -36 error (since the System 6 days, at least) is a file error, usually a premature end of file or the like and points to a problem with the file system. Boot up in recovery mode, run disk utility. And if you have something like Diskwarrior, run that too... <comment338215> I've checked and no file corruption. And as I mentioned. If the same files are accessed from a different system, they open right away. <comment338328> It is not about the files themselves it's about the file *system* on the computer that displays the error. If Mac #1 has the problem and Mac #2 does not then the problem is with Mac #1. Since a -36 error is a filesystem error the first step is to repair the file system.
