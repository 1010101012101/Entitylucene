Command line replacement for tmutil <body> Anyone know of a command line replacement for tmutil, either script or binary?  Failures of tmutil:  ul liDoes not log./li liNo meaningful diagnostics./li liCannot resume interrupted restore./li liCannot overwrite existing destination./li liDoes not recover gracefully from errors./li liDoes not handle the restoration from case sensitive TM volume to case insensitive destination./li /ul  <comment249464> If you're using Time Machine you're stuck with it. There are other back up options though, like Carbon Copy Cloner etc. Though I don't think any of the come with a CLI tool.
