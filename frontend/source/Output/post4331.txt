Black background on iPhone 4? <body> While I initially liked the ability to set custom backgrounds on my iPhone 4, I've come to find that I'm starting to miss the simple black background I had on my iPhone 3G. How can I set my background back to black?  <answer4334> Create a black image in your favorite image editor (even Paint will do if you're on Windows), save it as a jpeg, and e-mail or sync it to the phone. Then set that image as the background.   Since you're making it all black, I doubt the resolution is going to matter much, but you can always use 960 x 640 to use the iPhone 4's standard resolution.  strongEdit/strong to add a black image that works:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YSnoV.jpg" alt="alt text"  <comment4160> Hm, that seems like a bit of a hack, but I guess it could work. So there's no setting to get it back? Incidentally, do you happen to have a black image I could use for this? <comment4165> @Airplane Mode: Sorry, that's the only way I know of that works. Have added a black image for you. <comment4167> Awesome, thanks! <comment4976> +1 for the artistic skill in the included background image :) <comment5028> @torbengb - Ha, thanks! Unfortunately, that's the limit of my artistic skill...;-) <comment8676> +1 just for including the black background! lol
