How can I remove a signature once it's saved in Preview.app? <body> How can I delete a signature that I inserted using Preview.app?   I can edit or delete all the text fields but the signature seems locked somehow.  <answer143712> A possibility is to trybr File  Revert To  Browse all versions...    though I guess it will depend on how far back that version history goes. I've been unable to discover just how far back that would be &amp; for how long it may be saved.  <answer236513> You cannot remove a Preview.app signature in Yosemite. This is a bug. It would almost make sense if signing a document froze the entire document,but you can edit every other annotation.  I've tried masking a signature with a filled box, then overlaying a signature on that. It seems to work and the document saves, but on opening tne new signature is gone. (Another bug.)  <comment105892> What kind of file is it ? Image ? pdf ? <comment105893> Its a pdf. I originally created the file (a form) in Illustrator but overwrote the original with Preview. When I reopen it in Illustrator the text gets broken, so I am faced with recreating the original form again. <comment105900> Are you deleting the signature that's stored in the Preview app or wanting to modify a document that you signed and saved using preview? <comment105910> bmike. I want to modify a document that I signed and saved using Preview. I haven't tried deleting the signature that is stored in the app.
