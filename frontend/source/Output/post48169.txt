Shortcut for opening applications stack on dock bar <body> Is there any keyboard shortcut to open applications stack on dock bar?   The idea is I want to be able to open any app without using mouse.  <answer48171> Maybe you should try Alfred or QuickSilver. Both of them give you the ability to open any applications quickly, not just the applications on dock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oHUVe.png" alt="Alfred Screenshot"  Play around with them and I am sure you will find your workflow on Mac more efficient.  <answer48172> Why not to use Spotlight? It's fast and doesn't require any other software installed. By default it has a shortcut kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdspace/kbd (you can set this shortcut in System Preferences).  Spotlight quickly finds the application (or file) as you type.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UYrAb.png" alt="Spotlight Search for Application"  <answer48173> The fastest way (that I can think of) to open the Applications folder is the following:  Press kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⌥/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd. (This is the fastest way to open a new Finder window from within any application.)  Then, browse to the Applications folder by hitting kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdA/kbd.     The idea is I want to be able to open any app without using mouse.   I have kbd⌘/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd mapped to Spotlight, so I can just use that keyboard shortcut, then start typing the name of an app, hit kbdEnter/kbd, and that’s it.  <answer48174> kbdctrl/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdF3/kbd  ..selects an item of the dock. You can navigate using the strongarrow keys/strong. The selected item is the one that will be selected emfirst/em the next time you use this shortcut.  Once you've selected the Applications folder, the shortcut becomes for the next time:  kbdctrl/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdF3/kbd+kbd&#x21A9;/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1iXWg.png" alt="enter image description here"  BTW: You can also use kbdctrl/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdF2/kbd to access menubar items.  <answer102681> There is a trick for switching application windows including the minimised ones in MAC OS X.  After choosing the app by pressing CMD + tab, hold press option key and release other keys. Minimized window will be opened.
