Can I have both a case-insensitive system volume and a case-sensitive volume within an encrypted CoreStorage volume? <body> ( seems possibly related to Is it possible to have multiple filevault2-activated partitions on one disk? )  I have a MBP with a single internal SSD and I'd like:  ul lito have everything on the disk encrypted in case I lose the laptop/li lito have my home dir be case-sensitive b/c i'm used to Linux/li lito have personal stuff separate from the OS in order to facilitate future OS updates/li lito keep the main system volume case-insensitive to avoid possible OSX weirdness/li /ul  It seems like what I'd like is either:  ul litwo partitions, both filevault2 encrypted, one regular HFS+ and one case-sensitive HFS+, emor/em/li lia filevault2 encrypted CoreStorage container with a regular HFS+ volume and a case-sensitive HFS+ volume in it/li /ul  Do either of those make sense and, if so, are they possible?  <answer146296>    Can I have both a case-insensitive system volume and a case-sensitive volume within an encrypted CoreStorage volume?   Core Storage:   ul lican not create a volume within a volume/li lican create a logical volume (LV) within a logical volume emgroup/em (LVG). /li /ul     … to keep the main system volume case-insensitive …   That's reasonable.      … to have my home dir be case-sensitive …   Maybe desirable, but please beware: some software for OS X may not work as expected in that environment. I thought first of Adobe, found examples from 2012 and 2013:   ul liDear Adobe - Alastair’s Place/li liAdobe Acrobat XI Pro Installation Failure (Case Sensitive User Directory) | Adobe Community/li /ul  h2An example – OS X 10.9.5, Mavericks/h2  I used Disk Utility to create two partitions from a USB flash drive (at code/dev/disk12/code at the time), then erased each of the unencrypted file systems – and opted to encrypt.   For both encryptions I chose the same passphrase that is used to encrypt the FileVault 2 OS X startup volume.

As expected, no automation of that sort.   h2Issues/h2  With Mavericks I can find no way to create more than one LV within an LVF.   The following articles state that it's possible to do so:   ul liUndocumented CoreStorage Commands (2011-08-05)/li liCarter Allen - Practical Usage of CoreStorage (2011-08-14)/li liOS X CoreStorage Volume - shrink and create new - Fabian Franke (2013-02-25)/li /ul  In the Franke article it's remarkable that the same UUID is used to both (a) shrink an existing LV; and (b) create another LV in the same LVF.   Unless I'm missing something, this approach is impossible with Mavericks.

(I should not expect a fix in Mavericks.)  <comment171677> Any advice on re-phrasing the question would be appreciated as well. Thanks! <comment171682> Excellent query. I think the wording is a nice medium. Not too wordy, but the use case is complex enough to need the detail you have provided. <comment172439> One way or another, this is a fantastic answer. <comment172776> Any final results?
