Fan on Mac Book Air & Finder crash always <body> This is my first question here. So I hope to be clear in my explanation.  I own a Mac Book Air 13-Inch Mid 2013, 1,7 GB, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3. OSX Yosemite. Version 10.10.2  strongFINDER CRASH/strong Every time I turn on the Mac finder crash. OS show this message "the last time you opened finder it unexpectedly quit while reopening windows"  Any ideas whit this issue?  I had tried  Solution  Open the Terminal app. Type: sudo update_dyld_shared_cache -force Press Return. When prompted, enter your OS X user password, and press Return. Wait until the text prompt returns, at which point the process will be complete. Restart the computer.  FAN The Fan stay lot of time on and there is no software open.  Thanks in advance for your comments  Pablo  <answer176633> First thing I'd try is to remove the saved state - assuming you can get that farâ€¦  navigate to code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState//codebr &amp; delete that entire folder content.  If you can't get far enough to do that, it can be done from single user at boot, but I'd need someone smarter than me to fill the details, so post a comment or revise your question if that's the case.  <comment208618> use SMC reset to get your Fan to behave. shift+ctrl+alt+power
