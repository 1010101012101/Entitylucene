macOS based devices on network unable to resolve local DNS entries after network change <body> I have some static DNS entries configured on my Sophos XG firewall.  Every device on my network (Linux, FreeBSD, Windows devices) are able to resolve all entries without problems.    However, my two MacBook Pros cannot resolve most of these entries (2 out of 15 work).    Something interesting I noticed is that codenslookup/code works and give's me the correct IP address but codeping/code does not resolve.       MacBook-Pro:~ user$ nslookup nas.localbr   Server:       172.16.1.1br   Address:  172.16.1.1#53        Non-authoritative answer:br   Name: nas.localbr   Address: 172.16.1.3     Dig also works fine in resolving.  But ping:       MacBook-Pro:~ user$ ping nas.localbr   ping: cannot resolve nas.local: Unknown host     I also cannot access by DNS name in any app or browser.  Furthermore these all used to resolve before I made a change in the network.  It used to be a 192.168.1.x based network and now is 172.16.1.x.  But i've checked every possible setting on the router/firewall and can find no configuration problems.  Also this problem is only happening on macbooks, all other devices can resolve everything fine.  I've rebooted everything without luck.  Also tried flushing DNS.  Both MacBook Pros are running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.
