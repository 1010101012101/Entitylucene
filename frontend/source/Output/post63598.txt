Invert scrolling on Windows Bootcamp <body> It just irritates me a little bit that when I scroll in Windows, I have to scroll normally, but on Mac OS X, I have to change back to the other scrolling (Inverted), I prefer the Mac OS X way, is there a way to have this setting on Windows using Bootcamp settings or such?  <answer174613> the guy've written a small c# app to change the registry settings for all devices. It enumerates every device and changes the 'FlipFlopWheel' setting to 1 or 0 depending on which button you press.  the full source is available on github, the source code that actually does the flipping the registry setting (&lt;100 lines) is here: https://github.com/jamie-pate/flipflop-windows-wheel/blob/master/Form1.cs  for those just wanting to 'get it done' here is the executable (asks for UAC elevation) https://github.com/jamie-pate/flipflop-windows-wheel/blob/master/bin/Debug/FlipWheel.exe  <answer202235> I use this free program to set the scroll wheel to reverse scroll in windows 10. I also use it in windows 7 at work and set the work mouse wheel button to back. Super useful.  https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/XMouseButtonControl.htm  <answer215687> WIndows BootCamp reverse scrolling http://tsentas.net/windows-bootcamp-reverse-scrolling/  <answer216026> I've recently switched from Parallels to Bootcamp for doing 3ds Max work. This issue drove me bananas! I finally found this fantastic utility, called Trackpad++. It not only solved the 'natural scrolling' issue, but also brought back things like three-finger drag, and other gestures. It really is the perfect solution (and no, I don't know the developer): http://trackpad.forbootcamp.org/  <answer222118> strongIt worked for me this way:/strong  ol liOpen Control Panel./li liIn the search field at top right type, 'mouse' and hit enter./li liClick on 'mouse' in green - the top one!./li lithe very last tab of the window that popped up will be your device's software settings - click it and open up the settings program./li liClick on Two Finger Scrolling under Multi-Finger Gestures and select GEAR symbol./li liSelect (or deselect) "Enable reverse scrolling direction"./li /ol  <answer265605> And to invert emhorizontal/em scrolling, use a very similar Powershell script (remember to run Powershell as administrator):  precodeGet-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\HID\*\*\Device` Parameters FlipFlopWheel -EA 0 | ForEach-Object { Set-ItemProperty $_.PSPath FlipFlopHScroll 1 } /code/pre  (note codeFlipFlopHScroll/code instead of codeFlipFlopWheel/code)  (Per this link)  <comment260575> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
