Changing The Dock's Appearance From 3D to 2D? <body> Sometimes the glossy finish to the Dock 3D's appearance annoys me, and I want something less bedazzling on the eyes.  Is there a simple terminal command I can use to convert it from a 3D glossy to a 2D plain dock in appearance ?  <answer103593> Yes, you can, strongbut only in OS X 10.8 or earlier/strong.  You can use the the following Terminal command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Dock /code/pre  hr  To go back to 3D, run the following command (replace codeYES/code with codeNO/code):  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean NO &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Dock /code/pre  <answer103612> The following is a script you can save as whatever you want. I call it codeDockChange.sh/code. Make sure it has the code.sh/code extension on the end.  It needs to be codechmod +x/code before you run it; so using the name above I would need to type codechmod +x DockChange.sh/code into terminal, then to run it I only need to type code./DockChange.sh/code and it will do it's magic.  precode#!/bin/bash dock2d3d=$(defaults read com.apple.dock | grep "no-glass") if [ $dock2d3d == "\"no=glass\" = 0;" ] then   defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES &amp;&amp; killall Dock else   defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean NO &amp;&amp; killall Dock fi /code/pre  This script will automate the process for you.  <comment121896> I'm assuming by your first statement, it is not compatible with OS X 10.9 Mavericks (which I would assume only beta testers and developers have anyway). <comment121897> @Simon Yes, that is correct. <comment121898> If I want to go back from 2D to 3D ? <comment121899> @Simon Replace `YES` with `NO` (see edit to answer). <comment121901> Excellent, much appreciated. <comment123627> Interesting read regarding 2D Terminal Command in OSX Mavericks http://www.tekrevue.com/2013/10/10/popular-2d-dock-terminal-command-wont-work-os-x-mavericks/
