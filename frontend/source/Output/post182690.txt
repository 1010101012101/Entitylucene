Can’t find .plist files <body> I can’t find the code.plist/code file for TextEdit, Preview. I’ve looked into code/Library/Preferences/code, code~/Library/Preferences/code, and code~/Library/Containers/code. I have tried opening the app and changing the preferences and still it doesn’t create them.  I run the following command in Terminal to find it:  precodemdfind -name (osascript -e 'id of app "Preview"').plist -onlyin ~/Library/Preferences -onlyin /Library/Preferences -onlyin ~/Library/Containers/ /code/pre  I also looked myself and they weren’t there. Any reason this is happening? Odd this is I can still read the defaults with codedefaults read -app Preview/code in the Terminal. So where is that coming from, is there another place it’s stored at.  <answer182692> For TextEdit :   precode$ ls ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep Text com.apple.TextEdit.LSSharedFileList.plist com.apple.TextEdit.SandboxedPersistentURLs.LSSharedFileList.plist /code/pre  For Preview :   precode$ ls ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep Preview com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList.plist com.apple.Preview.SandboxedPersistentURLs.LSSharedFileList.plist /code/pre  <answer182898> precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.plist /code/pre  and  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist /code/pre  ~/Library/Containers does not seem to be indexed, at least on my system, so mdfind didn't find them. That said, I have a copy of my system on another hard drive, which IS fully indexed, and it listed some files there that started me poking around in that folder on my OS drive.  <comment217611> That’s not the preferences, that’s something else. The files the app has access to and created bookmarks? Anyways, it’s different than what you get when you do `defaults read -app Preview` or `defaults read com.apple.Preview`. Where is the file it reads from in either of those commands?
