Can't copy and paste from "popup lightboxes" in Chrome Version 40.0.2214.94 (64-bit) <body> In recent days I've slowly been losing my mind trying to copy and paste URL's, code snippets and other bits of information. Assuming when I paste and see "old" pasteboard content that I hadn't pressed CMD and C correctly.  But I've pinned it down to only happening in popup light boxes, I disabled all extensions and it's still not working.  Any ideas?  <comment200681> Do you have an example of sites where this does not work for you? Does it work if you right-click and choose Copy? Did this just start occurring? Does it work in Safari? <comment200768> Fails on both Facebook and Google Plus, right clicking is working OK :)
