Home screen wallpaper not covering entire screen <body> I'm using ios 9 and ipad pro 9.7 inch. When I set the homepage wallpaper the bottom horizontal area reserved for icons is not using the wallpaper, instead it uses a grey background :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NyKlN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  On the lock screen the images utilizes whole screen.  Can the wallpaper for home screen be set so it incorporates the menu space at bottom of screen ?  <answer234031> This is the intended behavior and it cannot be changed. The bottom row takes on a color derived from the background itself (similar to iTunes when you expand an album).  Generally, that row will be filled with icons. Seeing it with a special background helps differentiate those apps which will show up on every page.
