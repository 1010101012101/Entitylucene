What actions are performed by Install OS X Mountain Lion.app that are not performed by InstallESD.dmg without the app? <body> h1Recommended/h1  Apple provides and recommends use of strongInstall OS X Mountain Lion/strong.app  ul lithat is, "the app" – in its entirety. /li /ul  For Build 12A269 for OS X 10.8, the version of the app is 1.3.12 (351).  h1Known/h1  Ignoring parts of the app – with codeInstallESD.dmg/code alone:  ul liinstallation emmay/em succeed./li /ul  (The same is true for Lion when parts of Install Mac OS X emLion/em.app are strongnot/strong used for installation.)  h1Unknown for Mountain Lion/h1  The full list of:   ul lithings that do not occur, things that may not succeed, when installation is attempted or performed with strongsomething other than the app/strong. /li /ul  My initial plan is to accept an answer that provides either:   ul lithe fullest list; or /li lithe best set of evidence for a partial list. /li /ul  h2Starting points/h2  com.apple.Boot.plist(5) OS X Manual Page – page dated March 17, 2011 for 10.7.4, the same date appears on the page within 10.8.   For Mountain Lion on some types of hardware, there may be a unique distribution (ESD).   Food for thought, just part of the Lion experience: June 2012 discussion of Downloading Hardware Specific Lion Installers (cache)(copy).  <answer59244> My working theory is that there are no meaningful differences in actions performed under the app as opposed to the DMG.  One could argue at a low level that the difference is that invoking the codeInstall OS X Mountain Lion.app/code bundle loads app and UI frameworks that simply mounting a DMG does not, but that's not exactly the intent of your question I'm sure.  Any meaningful installer-level actions should be identical in either medium, since the majority of the resources are in the DMG, and the DMG is in the app. The app must mount the disk image in order to get at the necessary assets.  <answer59248> There is no difference whatsoever. The app is just there to create an Installer image on your disk. It restores InstallESD.dmg to the target partition and moves the data to a temporary folder. Then it asks you to reboot, and the installer continues by booting from the target partition.  <answer59699> Son of InstallLion.pkg « Managing OS X (2012-07-25) reminded of the Munki project.   h1Actions described in the wiki for Munki/h1  From the 2012-07-26 edition of http://code.google.com/p/munki/wiki/InstallingOSX:     The postflight script performs the actions that the GUI   "Install Mac OS X Lion" or "Install OS X Mountain Lion" application   does when you choose to install OS X.      Those actions are:      ol   liCreate a codeMac OS X Install Data/code directory at the root of the target   volume./li   liMount the codeInstallESD.dmg/code disk image./li   liCopy the codekernelcache/code and codeboot.efi/code files from the disk image to the codeMac OS X Install Data/code directory. (The codekernelcache/code is copied to   the Recovery HD helper partition if the target volume is encrypted   with FileVault 2.)/li   liUnmount (eject) the codeInstallESD.dmg/code disk image./li   liIf the codeInstallLion.pkg/code is on the same volume as the target volume, create a hard link to the codeInstallESD.dmg/code disk image in   codeMac OS X Install Data/code, otherwise copy the codeInstallESD.dmg/code disk   image to that directory./li   liCreate a codecom.apple.Boot.plist/code file in the codeMac OS X Install Data/code directory which tells the kernel how to mount   the disk image to use for booting. (This file is instead created on   the the Recovery HD helper partition if the target volume is encrypted   with FileVault 2.)/li   liCreate a codeminstallconfig.xml/code file, which tells the OS X Installer what to install and to which volume to install it. It also provides a   path to a codeMacOSXInstaller.choiceChanges/code file if one has been   included in the package./li   liCreate an codeindex.sproduct/code file and an codeOSInstallAttr.plist/code in the codeMac OS X Install Data/code directory. These are also used by the OS X   Installer./li   liSet a variable in nvram that the OS X Installer uses to find the product install info after reboot./li   liUse the codebless/code command to cause the Mac to boot from the kernel files copied to the codeMac OS X Install Data/code directory./li   /ol   h2Generalising for Mountain Lion, without Munki/h2  For Ask Different, this answer requires more work.   Not definite at the moment, I assume that codeInstallLion.pkg/code is associated with a strongpostflight script of Munki/strong (not normally associated with Install OS X Mountain Lion.app).   Definite variations to what's quoted above:   ul linot codeMac OS X Install Data/code; the name of the directory is codeOS X Install Data/code/li linot codeRecovery HD/code; the name of the partition is codeBoot OS X/code./li /ul  hr  In the wiki for Simian (related to Munki): no mention of InstallESD.  <comment68256> I considered [Ask Different posts about `InstallESD`](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=InstallESD) before adding this question. Is this question answered elsewhere in Stack Exchange? <comment68258> … now checking the broader range of posts [about `InstallESD.dmg`](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=InstallESD.dmg) … <comment68264> Thanks for this first answer … maybe worth us giving additional thought to mount point arrangements etc.. I'll add something to the question. <comment68269> Potentially misleading – to the best of my knowledge the app, running, does **not** add any partition. Partitioning may occur later in the routine (when something other than the app is running). <comment68284> I am sorry. I checked again, and I see it restores InstallESD.dmg to the Target Volume without erasing it. I was probably thinking about the Recovery HD when writing this answer.
