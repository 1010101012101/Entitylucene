decrypting FileVault2 WDE seems stuck, how to unstick? <body> This is happening on an MBP Mid2010 running Mac OS X 10.9.3  I have been using FileVault2 full-disk encryption for several years now; however, I needed to decrypt to repartition the disk for BootCamp. I initiated decryption through Security and Privacy section of System Preferences. It's been stuck in "Decrypting... estimating time remaining" ever since (for about three days now), like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OD8xe.png" alt="img"  It also persists through reboots (twice now). The good part is it boots, the bad part is it is still stuck. I have googled around to gain some commandline-fu, but the results are just confusing me. Here are some results:  precode$ diskutil coreStorage list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 4C4E3BF0-E73A-4BF7-8A8C-2C43981FBB23     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         499248103424 B (499.2 GB)     Free Space:   0 B (0 B)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 5239F8A2-7636-4596-8BAC-8715A2D6946A     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     499248103424 B (499.2 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 51D0AB7B-0C06-4E0E-808A-80453841F0D5         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       Converting         Conversion Direction:    backward         Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume D5A2568B-31DB-4EC9-BE30-7445EEA18127             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          498929332224 B (498.9 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  also, if I try this:  precode$ sudo fdesetup disable Password: Error: FileVault is Off. /code/pre  it says it IS off.  Could someone enlighten me to what exactly is going on, and how do I unstick this process to some kind of understandable status, from which I could safely proceed? (yes I have backups, but I would prefer not to go full reinstall if at all possible)  <comment175448> June 23rd… Has it finished by now? <comment175595> Nope. There is no progress. Part of the system thinks it is not encrypted, and another part thinks it is encrypted. <comment175609> I see, thanks for the response… I asked because I was stuck at reboot (rotating throbber) after turning FileVault off, but in a few hours I lost my patience, rebooted hard and it decrypted just fine after the normal boot…
