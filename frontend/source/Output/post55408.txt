How can I see my home folder in the finder? <body> How can I go to my home folder in finder? and/or how can I navigate up a folder tree in finder  I am used to Ubuntu and finding /home/name easily in the gui  <answer55411> ul likbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdH/kbd takes you to your home folder/li likbdCommand/kbd+kbdUpArrow/kbd takes you one folder up/li /ul  Have a look at the "Go To" menu in Finder for additional key combinations. Some people like to use the kbd~/kbd character and the strongGo to Folder.../strong shortcut as that expands to the current user's home folder like on other UNIX operating systems.  You may also want to have a look at Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts (HT1343) which contains a huge list of OS X Lion keyboard shortcuts.  <answer55458> You can set Finder's preferences (Command + ,) to open your home folder by default.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XW7kp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer55459> In addition to the keyboard shortcuts, your home folder should be visible in the Finder sidebar by default:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5cG2s.png" alt="Finder sidebar"  If not, you can enable it in the Finder strongPreferences/strong, under the emSidebar/em tab: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2x0wR.png" alt="enter image description here"  If the sidebar isn't visible, you can turn it on with strongView &#x2192; Show Sidebar/strong or strong&#x2325;&#x2318;S/strong.  <comment351122> My home folder was not enabled by default, but I was able to follow the second step!
