How to plot a histogram to show occurrence of a certain number using Numbers <body> Sorry for this newbie question:  I want to do something like in a column there are numbers code0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4,/code  code0.2/code occur 2 times, whereas code0.3/code and code0.4/code occur once, I want to make make histogram that first bar show 0.2, the y value will be 2, and 0.3, 0.3 only 1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UbHQd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer66510> Here is one way.  h3Step 1/h3  ul liMake a new sheet./li liMake a table with one column and add your data to that column:/li /ul  0.2  0.3  0.2  0.4  ul liMake sure that this first table does not have a header column or a header row./li /ul  h3Step 2/h3  ul liIn the same sheet as the first table, make a new table with two columns./li liGive that table four rows (or more)./li liIn the new table, make the first column a header column./li liIn that first column add in a list of values you want to 'count' on, e.g.:/li /ul  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  ul liIn the second column, enter this formula in the first row code=COUNTIF(Table 1 :: $A$1:A$4,A1)/code where 'Table 1 :: $A$1:A$4' is referring to the column of data in the first table, and 'A1' is referring to the cell in the first row of the first column in this second table./li liCopy down the formula to the remaining rows in the second column of the second Table./li /ul  You should end up with the second table looking something like:     0.1    0      0.2    2      0.3    1      0.4    1   h3Step 3/h3  ul liSelect the second table and click the Charts icon in the toolbar./li liThe first chart type (vertical bar chart) should be what you need. You can then use the Inspector to change the design of the chart./li /ul  Hope this helps.
