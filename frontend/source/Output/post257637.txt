Client Connected Message in Console, <body> I got bored and started to look through my mac console, but I see these couple lines that say:  precodeProcess              Message com.apple.securityd: New client connection 0x7fad34d621f0: 50339 501 com.apple.securityd: releasing client connection 0x7fad34f439a0 /code/pre  Should I be worried about anything or is this a normal message?  Thanks,  Extra stuff:  I was downloading icons off the web earlier, does this have to do with anything?
