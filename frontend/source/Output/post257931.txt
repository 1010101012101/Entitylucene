Forwarding Specific SMS to E-mail or WhatsApp <body> Is there a way to forward SMSs from iPhone to an e-mail or to a WhatsApp message? I don't want to forward all SMSsâ€”just some specific/filtered ones based on from/sender field of SMS.   I believe something like a tasker (automated scripting) would work but I have "zero" knowledge with the iOS platform.  <comment322300> I don't believe it's possible on iOS but it might be possible on macOS using a script or similar. <comment322311> Are these SMS messages that have been received already, so stored on the iPhone, or are you looking for something that will review new messages coming in and do something with it? <comment322314> @tubedogg i need it for new sms messages something like sms handler but if you have any solution for stored ones it would work too... as long as i get the sms in less then 5 minutes.
