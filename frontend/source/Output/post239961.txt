Install OSX on previously wiped macbook pro <body> I have a 13 inch Macbook Pro.  I don't have any recovery discs or backup and the hard drive has been completely formatted to remove any Apple partitions.  I think the macbook is probably registered to me if that makes any difference.    I previously downloaded El Capitan and tried to install via bootable USB method but received a cryptic message (El Capitan cannot be installed on this computer, or something like that).  Anyway, given the situation outlined above, is there any way to install (any) OSX on this macbook?  I don't mind buying Snow Leopard if I knew it was guaranteed to work.   Edit, it's a 13" MacBook Pro from 2011.  Thanks in advance,  <comment294713> We need to know the precise model & year. The method changes depending on how old the machine is. <comment294714> Have updated to reflect this, thanks <comment294715> If it's previously had the necessary firmware update applied [even if the drive has been subsequently wiped], that machine can use Internet Recovery - https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201314 <comment294802> ok, ill give this a go and report back.  thanks, <comment297933> Thanks, worked perfectly, although i had to create a partition and format it first.
