PowerPoint presentations won't open on mac but I can see their preview on Finder. It says password-protected but it is NOT password-protected <body> Below is the powerpoint presentation I am trying to view. I can see it through Finder, as you can see below, but when I try to open it on OpenOffice or LibreOffice I get the dialog below. Again this file is not password-protected in any way, it is just one of those powerpoint presentations that people send by email.  Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNGVE.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X71Bm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer127528> It's shown because Preview can open PowerPoint files in view only mode; so I suppose you can open it with Preview.  <answer127531> Sorry, I would say it is password protected to prevent modifications, the PPS is not mistaking here.  You can preview it in Quick view (hit space bar) or Preview, but that is all.  If it would be a PPT the you could view it in Power Point.  <answer248163> I had a similar problem and discovered that for some reason the window was very small and only a corner of it was visible from the edge of the screen.  <comment149410> have you tried opening it in pages? <comment149416> maybe @johnpristine could try changing the .pps to .ppt? <comment149440> @dwightk I do not know how to do that without PowerPoint <comment149445> oh, I just meant through Finder. <comment306397> How does this address the OP's question regarding opening of a password-protected PPT?  - From Review -
