Bootcamp Windows 10 - No image are available <body> For those that don't know yet, Bootcamp no longer requires (supports) USB drive to install Windows.  I'm trying to install Windows 10 but getting a "No image are available" notice on Windows setup window after entering the license key.  I haven't found a single result about this online (so far). Any ideas?  Thanks...

When I skipped entering a product key, it brought up the iso image as expected.    On the second computer, I downloaded the first codeenglish/code image from Microsoft and it accepted the pro key.  Very strange that the codesingle language/code image meant home only (not pro).  <comment280994> Yeah that was the problem. The key wasn't "valid" according to microsoft but it's all sorted now.
