Hostname doesn't show in terminal anymore for MBP 10.9.5 <body> Not sure what I installed or did to do this. The IT guys at work don't know but said my setup is wrong currently. We can also migrate this to the Unix &amp; Linux group if it's more appropriate too.  In my terminal window, the prompt shows up as   precodefirst.last@localhost:~&gt; /code/pre  When I execute codehostname/code in the terminal window, it shows "localhost" also.  However, according to the IT guys, it should be showing  precodefirst.last@HOSTNAME:~&gt; /code/pre  I'm using the bash shell.  In my .profile file, I see the following cmd to show the above syntax for my prompt in the terminal:  precodePS1='\u@\h:\w&gt;  /code/pre  When I click on System Preferences-Sharing, it shows my hostname under Computer Name.  Where can you change your computer's hostname to make it do this where   ol lithe output of the codehostname/code command returns localhost/li lithe hostname in the terminal prompt also reflects hostname but /li lithe System Preferences shows the name correctly/li /ol
