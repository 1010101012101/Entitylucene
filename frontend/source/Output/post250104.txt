TimeMachine backup over DDNS AFP Causes Consistency Issue <body> I have a TimeMachine backup to a local NFS (1Tb partition) on a WdMyBookEX2. The backup works fine when I'm connected locally over ethernet/wifi (takes a while to backup about a TB).  When I'm away from home, I have setup DDNS, port-forwarding for AFP, etc. So I can connect to my WDMyBookEX2 remotely over AFP and run the backups normally.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHWGa.png" alt="Connect to drive AFP"  I typically add it as a '2nd Volume' in the prompt from the TimeMachine wizard.   However, I've discovered that emtypically/em after the verification of the backup is done, the wizard reports that it has "become inconsistent", and that TimeMachine suggests I start a 'new backup' in order to ensure consistency. (Don't have message in front of me right now)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TNTLg.png" alt="Select Disk"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ncIe.png" alt="Use Both"  Is there anyway to avoid this? I would prefer to continue running backups while I'm away from home, even remotely.  <comment310431> That's because the host is part of the time machine connection reference, even if it's the same server. <comment310432> @John Keates, so I should do the initial backup (say locally over lan)  to my afp disk and it should resolve the issue? <comment310572> No, the issue is with using two different connections to the same share. Always use the same to resolve the issue. <comment311862> Will this issue continue if my IP address isn't static? Hostname stays the same but I'm issued a new IP address by my ISP? I finished the backup always using the same hostname- however, I got the error again <comment311878> Any change in the parameters will cause TimeMachine to loose track on who's who I'm afraid.
