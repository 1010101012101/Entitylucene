How can I list the partition table of an unmounted disk image? <body> I want to prepare Raspian Jessie found here in SD card for Biosignal Pi, instructions found here, but I have only OS X 10.11.3 El Capitan of Macbook Air 2013-mid now.  The image is in codefstype/code format so it is not compatible with OS X.  Verifying that using the correct hash by  codeopenssl sha1 /Users/masi/code/2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.zip/code which gives  precodeSHA1(/Users/masi/code/2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.zip)= 4a841dffd02197548bf2329b90a0a44eeeebb4ab /code/pre  which is the correct hash found in the website so not corrupted file. However, running SHA1 on the .img returns different SHA1 than with David  precodemasi$ openssl sha1 2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img SHA1(2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img)= da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 /code/pre  One step requires me to list the partition table of an unmounted disk image. On Linux I would use codefdisk -l/code, but OS X codefdisk image.img/code gives  precodeDisk: 2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img    geometry: 0/4/63 [0 sectors] Signature: 0x0          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused    /code/pre  where you can see that the system does not recognise the image.  I try to mount the image code2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img/code in DiskImageMounter.app application but I get  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tqpvl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer231225> Do you have to have it on the command line?  If not, I would use Disk Utility.  <answer231226> h2UPDATE:/h2  What you are looking to do is list all of the partitions of a disk image that you downloaded.  OS X isn't going to mount any ol' filesystem.  Natively, it will mount HFS, HFS+, CDFS, FAT 16, FAT32, and ExtFAT and read/write.  It will mount NTFS as read-only.  What filesystem does your image use?  Since it is Linux based, it could be Ext2/3/4.  Have a look at fuse-ext2 and fuse-ext4.  You can find more details here:  How can I mount an ext4 file system on OS X?  Once you install the drivers for the Linux file syste, you will be able to mount the image.  h22nd Update:/h2     I want to setup Biosignal Pi system in SD card. For that, I need to   prepare the card in my system.   Now that we know what you are trying to do, you don't need to emmount/em the image, you need to emcopy/em it to your SD.  Basically, what you are going to do is   ul liinsert your SD Card/li liuse codediskutil list/code to list all the drives/partitions to strongfind/strong the SD card (it will be /dev/diskX where X is some integer).  The easiest way to do this is to issue the command without the SD card inserted, and then again with it inserted and compare the output. The new entry will be your SD card./li liuse codediskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX/code to unmount (not eject) your SD card (so you can write to it)/li liuse codedd/code to copy the image from the file you downloaded to the SD card.  Use the command:  use the command: codesudo dd bs=1m if=path_of_your_image.img of=/dev/diskX/code/li liuse codediskutil eject /dev/diskX/code to eject your SD card so you can use it in your Raspberry-Pi device./li /ul  These is the "quick guide" that gives you the essentials.

This works at least in 10.9.5 Mavericks - 10.11.3 El Capitan.  <answer231232> h2Update 2/h2  Actually, there is no need to use the DiskImageMounter.app. The codefdisk/code command can be used directly on the .img file. In other words, the command  precodefdisk 2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img /code/pre  produces the same results as when I executed codefdisk /dev/disk2/code. When I run the command   precodeopenssl sha1 2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img /code/pre  I get the results shown below.  precodeSHA1(2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img)= 6a9ac027081aa38213ebe1fcf9ed502a6d6ec14e /code/pre  I also have a (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) iMac running El Capitan OS X 10.11.3. The results using this computer are the same.  Note that if the code2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img/code file is mounted using the DiskImageMounter.app application, the hex value produced by codeopenssl sha1 2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img/code changes. strongThis would indicate the image file is not mounted readonly./strong   h2Update 1/h2  Since I also have El Capitan OS X 10.11.3 installed on my (20 inch, mid 2007) iMac, I can verify against your machine. Using the command  precodeopenssl sha1 2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.zip /code/pre  the result is   precodeSHA1(2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.zip)= 4a841dffd02197548bf2329b90a0a44eeeebb4ab /code/pre  which is the same as your results. The rest is the same as shown below when I used Yosemite.  h2Original Answer/h2  I am using Yosemite OS X 10.10.5.  I downloaded code2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.zip/code.  Using the Finder application, I right clicked on this file and selected the open with "Archive Utility.app". This created code2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img/code.

How can you use your method with it? I could not mount the image in the system for some reason. I will update the body. <comment282329> I updated the body. I could not mount the image by Disk Utility. There is no such a feature as mount the .img file in the application <comment282335> Ah; I didn't realize you were trying to mount an .img file.  I thought you were trying to see all the partitions on the system.  My mistake. <comment282340> So you basically want to list the partition table of an *unmounted* disk image? <comment282346> Why are you trying to mount this image?  What are you trying to accomplish? <comment282349> As already mentioned, please focus on the problem you are trying to solve here. Just adding more details about missing commands etc. will not make the question more clear, as the approach required to solve the problem on OSX might be quite different from Linux (from where the instructions seem to come which you are trying to follow). <comment282352> This answer is simply wrong. You don't need any file system (e.g hfs+ or ext4) driver to read a partition table of a disk. <comment282354> @klanomath - If it's an image written in a fstype not compatible with OS X he does.  He can't read it now so that pretty much tosses your argument out a window.  Secondly, I have a dual boot X Serve with OS X and FreeBSD UFS file system.  OS X cannot see the multiple UFS partitions.  Can't read it, period. <comment282356> @Allan Can you please add an explanation about `fstype` in your answer. Your last comment is helpful. <comment282357> @Masi  Sure...not sure if I understand the qustion...what are you looking for specifically? <comment282358> @Allan Just check my answer. All partitions are listed! <comment282359> @Allan Just to prepare the SD card of Raspian with OS X. <comment282360> @klanomath then you have something additional installed because I can't and he can't <comment282361> I get `hdiutil: imageinfo failed - image not recognized` with your first command. Do you have something additional installed? <comment282362> @klanomath...one more thing...this entire thread is moot because his question and what he wanted to do are two totally different things.  Ultimately (after many edits on the OP's part), he wanted to copy the image to his SD card...which is what I answered in my 2nd Update. <comment282364> Did you use the image of the full desktop image found here https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ ? Hmm, it seems to be just some part of your system. <comment282365> @Masi: Yes, the full desktop image based on Debian Jessie: 2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.zip <comment282366> @Masi Hmm no I have neither installed osxfuse nor Paragon drivers. Paralles/VMware is installed though. <comment282427> I provided a screenshot about what happens when attempting mounting with DiskImageMounter.app. I verified the hash and it is the same as in the website. <comment282428> @DavidAnderson Hardware may be corrupt. This device has been 5 times under Apple's warranty, but according to Apple, the device should be ok. Motherboard new, SSD new and OS X new. I will put this device once more to Apple if we cannot find out a logical reason for the output. <comment282436> You may want to try running `openssl sha1 2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie.img` and compare with my results. Also, the DiskImageMounter.app is not needed. (See my Update 2) <comment282442> Your .img SHA is different than mine. Something wrong in unzipping of the system. <comment282444> @Masi: Try unzipping the file again. I trying at least a dozen times on two different Macs which produced the same results. Also, your posted results from `fdisk` would indicate the beginning of your image file contains all zeros. I used the "Archive Utility.app" application to unzip the file. <comment282470> @Masi Have you been able to hunt down the error? You either tried to mount the image without locking it or your RAM/Processor/SSD is corrupted. Do you get any errors in the system log? <comment282478> No. I just know that some corruption error in RAM/Processor/SSD during the unzipping process. SSD is unlikely but possible. Which logs would you want to look at? <comment282480> @Masi You may look in the system log for "I/O error" (SSD). RAM/Proc errors (like flipping bits) are rarely detected. It may also be a bus error. Did you try to mount the locked img (after unzipping it once more)? <comment282481> Yes, I did mount it afterwards successfully after I got unzipped the correct .img.
