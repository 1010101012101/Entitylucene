OS X Server Users Read & Write but can't delete <body> running OS X Server (Mavericks) I am trying to use file sharing. When I create a Folder and select that for sharing and add users they get read &amp; write access, but when I take a closer look via the Server App under Storage, they all have no "Delete" permission on folders inside the share.  This happens on new folders I share as well as with users I newly create. Any ideas? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xMjSY.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer133284> Have you tried repairing permissions?

I wonder, is this default behavior, that if I set a user to read&write for a share, that he can't delete folders within that share? Or is 'something' messed up on the server? <comment159699> @Kevin It depends where your shares are located, but based on your description, yes, but only once for each share. If your new shares are within a single folder, do this to that folder and new shares will inherit these permissions and not require this procedure. <comment159700> thanks for the suggestion, I'll try and report back
