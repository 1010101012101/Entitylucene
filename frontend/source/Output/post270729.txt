Text message forwarding not working on Mac <body> Just replaced my SIM card by a new one with the same number. Text message forwarding stopped working for me now.  ul liFaceTime calls working on my Mac and vice versa./li liiMessage works on Mac and vice versa./li liWhen i receive text message (SMS) it shows only on the iPhone, on Mac i get nothing./li /ul  Tried to reboot Mac, iPhone - didn't help. Tried to turn off iMessage in General settings, then turning it on doesn't help, but now i get "Waiting for activation..." below iMessage switcher.  So i can't use text messages on my Mac. Any suggestions?  <comment340244> Go to settings on your phone. Then to the "messages" settings panel, and find the text message forwarding area. Make sure that your Mac is listed as a device receiving text message forwarding. If it is not, set it up. If it is, try removing that device and setting it up again. <comment340512> It is listed, but how to remove it?
