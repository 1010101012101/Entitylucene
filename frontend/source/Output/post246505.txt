How to use ua:// URLs <body> There are buttons in the Starbucks app on iOS for redeeming free apps and if I long press on the button, it shows a URL like codeua://75A6A5DC-D3BE-4056-9482-CEBCD5493F98/code. However, I don't know how to use the URL if I copy it. Safari won't navigate anywhere if I paste it in the address bar and press kbdGo/kbd. If I just tap the button in the Starbucks app, it takes me to the App Store and automatically begins to redeem an app (presumably using a code embedded in, or retrieved from, the codeua:///code URL, but I'm not sure on thatâ€”just my hypothesis).  I have Googled and can't find any information on the codeua/code URI. Can someone link me to documentation on what it means and how to use links like that?  <answer246532> When you click the button, iOS looks for an app that advertises itself as being able to handle codeua:///code-URLs. Safari doesn't know how to do that, you'll need an app for that. I don't know if there's a way to find out which app responds to which URL schemes. See this developer article.  <comment304029> If I had to guess, I think that's Urban Airship's URL scheme.  Something must not be implemented properly on your device or the Starbucks app.  I'd reach out to their support team. <comment304032> @JAL Let me clarify the question to explain more in-app behavior. <comment304033> Let me clarify the question to explain more in-app behavior.
