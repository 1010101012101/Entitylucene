Is there a way to change the timeout setting for iCal / Calendar in 10.8? <body> I have a user connected via iCal to an overworked old CalDAV server (running OS X Server 10.5.8) who was doing fine in OS X 10.6.8. The data (from a number of groups, and his own individual calendar) would sometimes take a while to refresh, but it always came down eventually.  Once he upgraded to 10.8.1, his calendars would often have exclamation points next to them saying they couldn't connect. Manually refreshing would add "Updating..." to the title of the calendar window, but most of the time, the exclamation points would come back. I did some testing with LittleSnitch, and found that, if Calendar didn't hear back from the server for 30 seconds, it would time out.  Using the same CalDAV account on another machine with iCal in 10.6.8, connecting to the same server, it goes past 30 seconds and keeps going. (Maybe the default setting is 60 seconds; I haven't seen it triggered.)  Does anyone know if there's a way to tell Calendar in 10.8.1 to wait a little longer before timing out?  <comment117319> I am having the same problem, did you find an answer to your issue? <comment117324> Never did. We actually ended up upgrading the iCal server to 10.8. (Although that turned out to be a whole other can of worms.) <comment117444> To be clear, we bought a new 10.8 server, set up new OD, and tried to export the iCal data from one to the other. Never ever do this. It does not work. <comment118246> Yeah I think we are just going to hang out til we upgrade to Office 365 in a month or so. Migrated the problem calendar to gmail which kept the client happy. <comment118253> Yep. That was where we landed eventually to. 10.8 Calendar server choked on all the OD differences, duplicate events, etc. Google Calendar just discarded the data it couldn't use.
