Audio recording from video files (SOFTWARE) <body> I am looking for an strongmac software/strong which enables me to easily cut strongaudio/strong fragments from video files.  For example: I have a movie file I am watching and at mark 00:34:22 to 00:34:53 there is an conversation I want to record with the application. So I go to the app, load the file and enter the time marks (or maybe navigate to it).  I know that it is possible to do something like this with final cut and other complicated mac video software. However, I am looking for a software with just that function, because I need to record multiple (WWII b/w recording for those interested) audio parts from multiple video files, sometimes there are around 90 audio parts that I need to cut out of an 60 minute video.  The best solution would be an software which is specified for smth like that, where I would just need to hit a button after selecting the time interval and it would save the audio file automatically in an folder, that would save me a lot of time.  I already googled but couldn't find a software which provides this function. Maybe someone of you has deal with a similar issue and knows a way/or a software to optimize this process.   Thank you guys.  <answer134596> If the video is an MP4 you could use GarageBand, Audacity or Rogue Amoeba's Fission.  GarageBand - drag movie to track in GarageBand. Open the audio editor, position the playhead to the start of the section, "Split regions at playhead" - command-T, move playhead to end of selection, command-T again, select the newly formed "region" and "share" to iTunes. Make sure you check the box that says "Export cycle areas only or length of selected region". Your "selection" gets converted to MP4 and placed in iTunes.  Audacity and Fission - Drop the movie onto the dock icon of the application, move the cursor to the appropriate spot in the "audio", highlight the section, then choose export selection (Audacity) or save selection (Fission).  I think GarageBand is easier because you can play the movie right there where you will do the "editing".  <answer134599> Even easier if you have Quicktime Pro.  ol liOpen in QTPro/li liSelect the clip you want by dragging the selection handles/li liCopy/li liFile - new/li liPaste/li liThen File - Export (to AIFF or the file format you prefer)/li /ol  I have been known to do just such things from time to time when converting flash video  <answer135410> QuickTime Player (Mavericks)  Select Trim from the Edit menu Adjust the trim area Click "Trim" button Export as audio-only Undo the Trim  Repeat as necessary You can move the playback control out of the way of the trim window by dragging it up from the bottom of the window
