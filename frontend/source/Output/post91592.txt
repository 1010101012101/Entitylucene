Problems with apache after update of php and mysql using homebrew <body> I am hoping someone here can assist me.  I upgraded php and related files using codebrew upgrade/code on my mac which is running Mac OS X 10.8.3. Everything was working fine before and I just wanted to update.  After I ensured that everything was fine as regards config files and vhosts I issued the following command to restart apache:  codesudo apachectl restart/code  I then tried to connect to codehttp://localhost/phpinfo.php/code  Safari errored out with:  codeSafari can’t open the page “http://localhost/phpinfo.php” because Safari can’t connect to the server “localhost”./code  in the terminal, issuing the following command:  codeapachectl -V | grep httpd.conf/code  results in:  code-D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE="/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf"/code  Server root is:  codeServerRoot "/usr"/code  and Document Root is:  codeDocumentRoot "/Volumes/sites"/code  DocumentRoot has permissions set to 755  As I said, everything was working fine until I restarted apache.  Now, nothing works.  I am completely lost, and I need to get things working again.  <answer91595> OK, so I found the culprit.  It is amazing that no error message was visible in console or in the error logs, but I found a site which helped me a lot.  http://blog.joshdick.net/2012/07/28/troubleshooting_apache_in_os_x_10.8_mountain_lion.html  In that post, the author, Josh, suggested restarting apache using the following command:  codesudo bash -x /usr/sbin/apachectl -k start/code  This command provides some error information, and overcomes the frustrating silent termination of Apache.  When I issued the command, it gave me the following output:  precode$ sudo bash -x /usr/sbin/apachectl -k start + ARGV='-k start' + HTTPD=/usr/sbin/httpd + test -f /usr/sbin/envvars + . /usr/sbin/envvars ++ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib: ++ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH + LYNX='lynx -dump' + STATUSURL=http://localhost:80/server-status + ULIMIT_MAX_FILES= + LAUNCHCTL=/bin/launchctl + LAUNCHD_JOB=/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist + '[' x '!=' x ']' + ERROR=0 + '[' 'x-k start' = x ']' + case $ARGV in + /usr/sbin/httpd -k start httpd: Syntax error on line 118 of /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf: Cannot load /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.11/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so into server: dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.11/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so, 10): Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/zlib/lib/libz.so.1.2.7\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.11/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so\n  Reason: image not found + ERROR=1 + exit 1 /code/pre  At the end of that snippet, you can see that it is trying and failing to load /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.11/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so  Well, when I upgraded my homebrew installs, php5 was upgraded to 5.4.15, so that path was no longer valid. (Actually, the path was valid, since php was now at 5.4.15, and the path pointed to the older 5.4.11 lib, apache was terminating.  Modifying that line in https.conf solved the issue.  <comment148863> This solved my problem exactly.  Thank you.
