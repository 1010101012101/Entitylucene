Xcode 5 update, why am I stuck on Xcode 3.2.6? <body> I'm running Xcode (downloaded from the Mac App Store) on my MacBook Pro running OS X Mavericks.  The weird thing is I am running version 3.2.6, yet Xcode claims to be up to date. There are no updates in the Mac App Store.  <answer107478> You may have Xcode 3.2.6 from an earlier installation and are running it. Note that Xcode 3.x being a pre-MAS (Mac App Store) version, installs into the code/Developer/code folder (emby default/em, although it can be installed elsewhere too), whereas the Mac App Store versions (from Xcode 4 onwards) install into the code/Applications/code folder. To run Xcode 5, make sure you're running the application from code/Applications/code. You can also use Spotlight to find where Xcode 3.2.6 resides on your system.  If you wish to uninstall the older version (Xcode 3.2.6), open codeTerminal.app/code and uninstall it using the command:  precodesudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all /code/pre  <answer107486> Xcode 4 was a separate download in the Mac App store. Xcode 5 replaced 4 in the app store. That is why you do not see an update. Download Xcode 5 directly from the Mac Appstore. If you would like to keep xcode 3.2 also installed, right click an xproj file and select to open all these files with xcode 5 to make it the default xcode in your system. But there is no reason nowadays to keep such an old xcode installation.  <answer121028> One very good reason in my book would be the interface - not an MDI-like monolithic structure copied from MSVC, but one with a nice, small project window and source files opening in individual windows. It isn't impossible to add configuration files so that Xcode 3 works with the newer compilers, and if you're using external build systems there shouldn't be any issues at all.  Do I understand correctly that an XCode 3 install isn't touched when upgrading from 10.6 to 10.9?  <comment126032> It's possible to install Xcode 3 in folders other than  /Developer, although that is the default. Spotlight should be able to help you find any instances of Xcode if it isn't in the /Developer folder. <comment126127> Thanks. I've edited the answer and added these points. <comment126565> Yep it was the dual instillations that was causing a problem with my app launcher. Dumb Dumb.
