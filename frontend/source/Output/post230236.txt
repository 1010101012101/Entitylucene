Separate mouse and trackpad settings with Karabiner <body> This post (which is upvoted 26 times as of this writing) suggests using Karabiner to set separate scroll settings for a USB mouse and the laptop trackpad.  Karabiner seems to be a nice application, and I understand the suggested solution (don't remap trackpad settings, then reverse scroll settings on all pointing devices except previously excluded ones) but it doesn't work in my case because the USB mouse strongIS/strong an Apple pointing device (it's an apple USB mouse).   There is an option "Don't remap an internal keyboard" but nothing about "internal trackpad". So really the question still stands; how to set different scrolling settings for the internal trackpad, and an external apple mouse?  <answer230241> It seems that this answer along with its comments solves the problem using Karabiner. It's a bit complicated, so I'll post a full description here:   ul liOpen Karabiner  Preferences/li liGo to the tab "Misc &amp; Uninstall" /li liClick "Launch EventViewer"/li liIn the viewer, go to the tab "Devices"/li /ul  You should see a table with several columns including "Vendor ID", "Product ID" and "Device Name".   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HzJaT.png" alt="Example device list in EventViewer"  ul liIdentify your USB mouse in the "Device Name" column, and write down the corresponding "Vendor ID" and "Product ID"/li liGo back to the Karabiner  Preference  Misc &amp; Uninstall and now click the button "Open private.xml"/li liThis will open Finder where the file codeprivate.xml/code is, open it with your favourite text editor/li /ul  Edit that file to look like this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;devicevendordef&gt;         &lt;vendorname&gt;Apple&lt;/vendorname&gt;         &lt;vendorid&gt;0x05ac&lt;/vendorid&gt;     &lt;/devicevendordef&gt;     &lt;deviceproductdef&gt;         &lt;productname&gt;USBMouse&lt;/productname&gt;         &lt;productid&gt;0x0304&lt;/productid&gt;     &lt;/deviceproductdef&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;USB Mouse Scroll Reverse&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;myUsbMouseScrollReverse&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;device_only&gt;DeviceVendor::Apple, DeviceProduct::USBMouse&lt;/device_only&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__FlipScrollWheel__ Option::FLIPSCROLLWHEEL_VERTICAL, Option::FLIPSCROLLWHEEL_HORIZONTAL&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Note that you should replace the fields codevendorid/code and codeproductid/code to the values you previously wrote down (from the EventViewer device list).  ul liSave the file codeprivate.xml/code/li liGo back to the window Karabiner  Preferences and now select the tab "Change Keys"/li liClick the button on the top-right "Reload XML"/li liYou should see a new entry in the table below with the name "USB Mouse Scroll Reverse" (or whatever name you set in the XML file)/li liTick that box/li /ul  That should be all!  <comment280973> [This answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/145962/126929) should work with any mouse. Just follow the instructions in the comments. **The gist of it is:** You use `Karabiner's EventViewer` to check the mouse `Vendor ID` and `Product ID` and then you use those ID's to tell `Karabiner` which device to target and it reverses the scroll wheel of that device. <comment280983> @Joonas This seemed to work, I will post a summary answer below. <comment280984> Alrighty. Good.
