disable IP compression (IPCOMP) using LZS in OSX for Cisco VPN connection <body> I'm trying to connect to a cisco vpn. it used to work, now it doesn't. I recently upgraded to Mavericks and I suspect this is likely to be the cause. my syslog shows the following information when I try to connect to the vpn. information has been changed to protect privacy.   precodeJan 01 00:00:07 my-macbook configd[18]: IPSec connecting to server &lt;SERVER address&gt; Jan 01 00:00:07 my-macbook configd[18]: SCNC: start, triggered by (273) com.apple.prefe, type IPSec, status 0, trafficClass 0 Jan 01 00:00:07 my-macbook configd[18]: network changed: v4(en0:10.10.10.200) DNS Proxy SMB Jan 01 00:00:07 my-macbook configd[18]: IPSec Phase1 starting.
