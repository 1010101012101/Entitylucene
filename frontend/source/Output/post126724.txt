Safari Reader support for code <body> Is there a Safari extension that can better display code in reader view?  Original on webpage:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0gu1.png" alt="enter image description here"  In reader view:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VEXw9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any way to better format code in reader view?  <comment148444> Except the '* img' going to the next line, what's wrong with current view? <comment148486> The code just looks like regular text, is there anyway to make it more distinguishable from the rest of the english text?
