iPhone 7 Voice Not Heard During Calls <body> I had an iPhone 5s with AT&amp;T. I rarely had any issues using the 5s at home.  I recently upgraded to iPhone 7 with AT&amp;T &amp; suddenly people can't hear me speaking during calls. This problem has been 100% consistent on every call I've been on at home since upgrading in early January. It does not matter if I'm using speaker phone or not; I've even switched back &amp; forth during the call. They can't hear me, but I hear them perfectly. I have tested the mic &amp; it works. I had a 2nd replacement iPhone 7 sent a couple of days ago &amp; it has the same problem. So far, this problem only happens with calls at home. I have no had an issue when calling or receiving a call at work. I have searched online &amp; found similar issues, but not this specific problem. I have tried the typical fixes people have suggested for the similar issues, but they have not worked. Has anyone had this specific problem?  <comment338558> If it works in one place but not another, repeatedly, speak to your phone provider; sounds like their issue, not the phone.
