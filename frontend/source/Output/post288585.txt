How do I disable the Apple ID sign in when logging into my Mac? <body> Whenever I restart my Mac, I'm first required to sign in with my Apple ID and after that the Mac (local) account and password. It's sort of a two-step process and I don't remember where I may have accidentally configured this setting, which is really annoying right now.   How do I turn off the Apple ID sign in, so I'm only required to log into to my MacBook using my local user account?  <answer288586> You could try this to disassociate your Apple ID password from login:  hr  h2To Stop Using an iCloud Password to Login to a Mac:/h2  ul liGo to the  Menu and choose strongSystem Preferences/strong (alternatively use LaunchPad or Spotlight to search for strongSystem Preferences/strong/li liChoose strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong and select the primary Mac login that you want to disassociate the iCloud password and for which you wish to use a unique separate password/li liClick the strongChange Password.../strong button next to the user name/li liAt the prompt "Do you want to change your iCloud password, or stop using your iCloud password to unlock this Mac and create a separate password?" – choose "Use Separate Password…"/li liSet and confirm the new password and close out of System Preferences when finished/li /ul  Now when the user is logging into macOS, a separate account password will be used rather than the iCloud and Apple ID account password. This setting is specific to individual user accounts.  Source and further reading: OSX Daily
