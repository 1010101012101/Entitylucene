What to do (besides rebooting) when Finder won't navigate to /tmp? <body> If one uses the codeCommand + Shift + G/code keyboard shortcut and asks Finder to navigate to code/tmp/code, on occasion instead of being taken to code/private/tmp/code (with appropriate hiding of the code/private/code directory from the user) the user is taken to code//code as exhibited here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C5Zji.gif" alt="attempting to navigate to &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; "  And if I attempt to navigate to code/private/tmp/code: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VWQAK.gif" alt="attempting to navigate to and open &lt;code&gt;/private/tmp&lt;/code&gt;"  What gives?  <answer269101> The answer appears to be related to codesetfile/code. If one runs codegetfileinfo /private/tmp/code:  precodeTomass-MacBook-Pro:tmp tomasgallucci$ getfileinfo /tmp directory: "/private/tmp" attributes: avBstclinmedz created: 07/30/2016 14:32:36 modified: 01/16/2017 14:56:52 Tomass-MacBook-Pro:tmp tomasgallucci$ /code/pre  In my case, the bundle flag was turned (capital letters mean attributes are turned on, lower case means they're turned off). To resolve the issue I was able to run  precodesetfile -a b /private/tmp /code/pre  And I could once again navigate to code/tmp/code in Finder.  What set the Bundle bit? I don't know. But life wouldn't be worth living if there weren't at least a few mysteries.  Here's a Super User article that discusses the topic in some detail.  <answer269110> Logging out your user will recycle Finder without needing to reboot. That will show you if the issue is a temporary bug or more permanent permissions issue with the file system.   <comment338050> How about trying `killall -HUP Finder` instead of logging out? <comment338065> @user3439894 I dislike killing Finder - file operations in progress, etc... at best, use AppleScript to ask Finder to quit. Log out is my proper suggestion - especially for online or when the (file?) system is already misbehaving or broken. <comment338313> @user3439894 Finder can also be restarted from the "Force Quit Applications" window. `Command+Option+Esc` can open it quickly. While restarting Finder might not be the best option as mentioned by @bmike, this is a quicker way than using the terminal. <comment338393> I tried rebooting my MBP and that solve the problem for a matter of hours. I'm not sure what turned the Bundle flag back on; my guess is that it had to do with trying to upload an .epub from /tmp to Google Drive.
