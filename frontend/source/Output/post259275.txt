getting safari to remember my bookmarks <body> On Safari Version 10.0.1 (11602.2.14.0.7) (10.11.6) I can't get it to remember my bookmarks.  I started by importing all bookmarks and history from Chrome.  In Safari, I open the side pane and drag bookmarks around, delete a few, then quit Safari.  Next time Safari is launched, everything is as it before I made any changes.  So I drag bookmarks around AGAIN, and delete a few AGAIN, and make some new ones.  Next time Safari is launched, everything is as it was when I first imported - it HAS NOT remembered my new bookmarks; the bookmarks I deleted are all back again.  I don't get it. I just want to manage bookmarks and have them save. Is this one of those stupid iCloud sync things again?
