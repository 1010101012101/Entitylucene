Mount folder as a volume (OSX) <body> Is it possible to (auto) 'mount' folders as Volumes? I have a large DAS Volume, 'Data', that contains all my data. To make paths shorter and more future proof, I'd like to have Volumes like  /ContentTypeA/ /ContentTypeB/  Instead of using  /Data/ContentTypeA/ /Data/ContentTypeB/  etc, which is where the data actually resides.  Any ideas on how to do that? It's not a big problem. Just curious.  <answer97932> Let's assume you are mounting/attaching your Data drive as usual which will result in paths like code/Volumes/Data/ContentA/code and code/Volumes/Data/ContentA/code. You can now do either of  ul licreate symbolic links via Terminal by starting Terminal.app and running these commands  precodeln -s /Volumes/Data/ContentA ~/ContentA ln -s /Volumes/Data/ContentB ~/ContentB /code/pre/li liopen code/Volumes/Data/code in Finder, select e.g. codeContentA/code, press kbdCmd-L/kbd to create an alias and move this alias to your Home folder. The alias file can afterwards be renamed as you see fit/li /ul  With both options the content of the Data drive will be accessible via your Home folder.  <answer261951> Sometimes symbolic links may not be suitable for your needs.  In that cases you can use bindfs - a FUSE filesystem for mounting a directory to another location.  Install it with homebrew:  precodebrew install bindfs /code/pre  And then bind one folder to another:  precodebindfs /Volumes/Data/ContentA ~/ContentA /code/pre  <answer269644> I just wanna say thanks to @mixel - that is THE WAY to do it, I actually wanted to mount the iCloud Drive as a volume, so that it appears on the desktop.  Installation of bindfs did not go that easy on Sierra, I had to do the following:  codebrew cask install osxfuse/code  codebrew install homebrew/fuse/bindfs/code  and then in my case I might add that the handy relevant bindfs option is code-o volumename=NAME/code, otherwise the volume gets some crazy name that hurts eyes.  And for anyone who'd like to have the iCloud Drive appear as a volume, the sequence is this:  codesudo mkdir /Volumes/iCloud\ Drive/code  codesudo bindfs -o volname=iCloud\ Drive /Users/robert/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs /Volumes/iCloud\ Drive//code  I don't have time now to find out how to make it re-mount after the computer restarts, but it's on my to-do list.  Anyway, thanks again @mixel for sharing your info on bindfs!  <comment114931> Does the answer to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/84222/is-there-a-disk-volume-substitute-command-in-osx-similar-to-subst-on-windows (which recommends the use of symbolic links or aliases) solve your problem? <comment114937> It doesn't seem to work with either. I.e. doing either cd /ContentTypeA/ or cd /ContentTypeA/existingfolder just says 'no such file or directory'. :( <comment114943> There will be no folders unless you create them :-) <comment114946> That works. :) Combining it with the home folder solved it. Thanks a lot patrix! <comment367209> cool thanks, is this different than the mount command on linux? or is this basically a port of the mount command to MacOS? <comment367240> @AlexanderMills bindfs is a FUSE filesystem for mounting a directory to another location. It's not mount command.
