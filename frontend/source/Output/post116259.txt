Detecting typing in Messeges app using applescript? <body> In the new Messages app, which replaced iChat, you can see when another person is typing:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IhZyi.png" alt="bubble"  And i've been scripting around the messages app and was wondering if there was any way to detect when the bubble appears and in which chat through AppleScript. I have studied the script suite and have not found anything pertaining to it, so i may have to fall back to grabbing the packets and scanning for it. Any idea on how to detect this would be great, Thanks!
