Volume on MacBook Pro low after disconnecting from Bluetooth speakers <body> As the title suggests, I am having issue with the volume of the internal speakers from my MBP after I disconnect from the Bluetooth speaker. This doesn't happen always, but it seems to happen with both my headphones and with the speaker, so it is not one device specific.  Currently, my volume is at maximum levels, but it is very quiet, probably around 50% of maximum value. I have tried killing all codecoreaudiod/code processes, trying to unload and load code/System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext/code, checked all the levels everywhere, tried turning off Bluetooth, but nothing seems to help.  Any suggestions what might be causing this? I am running the latest MacOS version, 10.12.6.  <answer294542> I had the same problem, I solved resetting the NVRAM  <comment371795> You mean you solve the issue temporarily by resetting the NVRAM, or the issue doesn't appear anymore?  Resetting NVRAM requires reset of machine, so I can solve the issue with simple reset as well, but the sound issue comes back once a week or so when tinkering a lot with Bluetooth devices.
