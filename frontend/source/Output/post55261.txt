Can I make the Podcasts App play my unplayed podcasts in chronological order? <body> The new Podcasts app is pretty swell. I'm particularly fond of the 'Unplayed Episodes' button that generates a playlist of all my unplayed podcast episodes, on which I can just hit 'Play' and let a half a dozen episodes of different podcasts just run in order, without having to actually edit or manage a playlist.  But there's one problem: They play newest first. strongIs there any way to change this playback order so that I can hear my oldest unplayed podcasts first?/strong  <answer59539> Unfortunately, no.   The combined strongUnplayed Episodes/strong playlist has no settings and defaults to newest first.  As of version 1.01, you can only sort strongindividual subscriptions/strong by oldest first.   Even if you go through the trouble of changing each individual subscription preference to oldest first, Podcasts app will still keep the strongUnplayed Episodes/strong playlist sorted to newest first.  <comment63440> Hi, there are a number of Podcasts apps. (Podcasts Assistant, Podcast Player Pro, etc). Which app are you using? If you are using Apple's Podcast Assistant, here is a comprehensive review - http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/429243/app_day_podcasts_by_apple/?fp=4&fpid=56736 The app will improve but this early version leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe try another app? <comment63441> @DavidDelMonte I'm sorry, I thought I was being clear through my use of capitalization and the tag. I'm specifically referring to the new app **Podcasts**, which is made by Apple and is now on the App Store. <comment63442> oops. I adjusted my comment and our wires crossed.
