AppleScript for restarting to Bootcamp? <body> I have tried to use an AppleScript to reboot to Windows It's not going well though, as when I tried it the first time, a white screen appeared on startup and didn't go away. A hard reset rebooted to Yosemite. I have this script saved as an Application and in my Dock for instant restart, but it's been disappointing.  Here's the script:   precodeset adminpass to "MYPASSWORDWENTHERE"  tell application "Finder"     set iconPath to (get name of startup disk) &amp; ":Applications:Utilities:Boot Camp Assistant.app:Contents:Resources:DA.icns" as alias end tell  set askRestart to display dialog "Restart in Windows?" buttons {"Cancel", "Restart"} default button 1 with icon iconPath set doRestart to button returned of askRestart  if doRestart is equal to "Cancel" then     quit end if  if doRestart is equal to "Restart" then     do shell script "bless -mount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/ -legacy -setBoot -nextonly; shutdown -r now" password adminpass with administrator privileges end if /code/pre  Can anyone help me get this thing to work?  <answer178381> precodedo shell script "bless -mount /Volumes/WINDOWS/ -legacy -setBoot -nextonly" with administrator privileges do shell script "shutdown -r now" with administrator privileges  /code/pre  Replace WINOWS with the name of your bootcamp partition.

If you are doing an EFI boot, then this script will probably not work. BIOS booting is the traditional way that BootCamp installs Windows on Macs. I added an additional button to allow changing the default operating system to Windows.  You are aware that you can hold down the alt/option key at startup to select which operating system to boot to? I also assume, you know that the default boot operating system can be selected from the System Preferences in OS X and the Control Panel in Windows?  You can also install the free rEFInd boot manager. This product can produce an optional boot menu each time you start (or restart) your Mac. You can then select which operation system to boot to. If interested, let me know, and I will help you set up rEFInd.    precodeset output to do shell script "diskutil list /dev/disk0" repeat with row in paragraphs in output     if row contains "Microsoft Basic Data" then         set slice to last word in row          set adminpass to "MYPASSWORDWENTHERE"          tell application "Finder"             set iconPath to (get name of startup disk) &amp; ":Applications:Utilities:Boot Camp Assistant.app:Contents:Resources:DA.icns" as alias         end tell          try             set askRestart to display dialog "Restart in Windows?" buttons {"Cancel", "Once", "Always"} default button 1 with icon iconPath         on error             exit repeat         end try         set doRestart to button returned of askRestart          if doRestart is in {"Restart", "Once", "Always"} then             set command to "bless --device /dev/" &amp; slice &amp; " --legacy --setBoot"             if doRestart is in {"Restart", "Once"} then                 set command to command &amp; " --nextonly"             end if             set command to command &amp; "; shutdown -r now"             try                 do shell script command password adminpass with administrator privileges             end try         end if          exit repeat     end if end repeat /code/pre  <comment211219> Does booting into Windows work if you run `bless ...` directly in Terminal? <comment211269> I haven't tried doing that. I'm not very competent in running basic Terminal commands at the moment. If you can give me the command to run the "bless" command, I'll gladly try it...I'm going to try the answer below and see if that works. :) <comment211276> Open Terminal, enter `sudo bless -mount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/ -legacy -setBoot -nextonly; sudo shutdown -r now` and press Return <comment211349> This script rebooted directly into Yosemite, even when I changed the volume to BOOTCAMP and added my admin password. Going to try the "bless" Terminal script. <comment211472> Maybe try using terminal and removing -nextonly, see if that works. That way we can probably get closer to the problem. Have you checked if the volume is called bootcamp in /Volumes/ ? Caps matter as well I believe <comment211588> This booted directly into Mac, unfortunatley...I have a sneaking suspicion that my BOOTCAMP volume is corrupted, because now even when I hold Option and try to boot from there, all I get is a white screen for a long period, followed by a black screen for a long period. <comment213025> I have used rEFInd. Unfortunately, it doesn't work anymore. And even holding Option won't boot Windows. You can see my comment above for more info.
