iCloud Locked Apple iPad Air (7.0.3) <body> So I have and Apple iPad Air (version 7.0.3). I haven't used it in a long time (about a year), and when i charged it and unlocked it, it continually asked me for my iCloud password. I have put in the correct password multiple times, but to no avail. I believe it isn't accepting my password because i changed it recently and the iPad won't connect to the internet because I got a new modem recently and it can't connect to the network quick enough before the request for my iCloud password pops up and interrupts it. What can i do to reset my iPad without my iCloud password??? Please help  <comment317552> What happens if you put in the OLD password? It's a long shot, but it might work. <comment317557> I highly doubt your modem has anything to do with it unless you changed your wifi login <comment317562> Also, when you enter a password it is checked against the password on Apple's servers. If it couldn't connect, it would be displaying a different error.
