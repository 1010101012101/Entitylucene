Wi-Fi Sweetspots for macOS? <body> Anyone know if there's a Wi-Fi Sweetspots type app for macOS. I've done some searching but I can't find anything as concise.  Wi-Fi Sweetspots is for iOS and tests the throughput of your Wifi connection by sending data to the router.  Nearest i've found is LAN Speed Test but that tests your LAN connection between the Mac and another device, which means you're also testing your APS, drive speed and ethernet cables (and one of those could be the weak link)  I've seen someone using "ipconf3" from terminal but I wasn't sure how they entered the router to test with (I get connection refused)
