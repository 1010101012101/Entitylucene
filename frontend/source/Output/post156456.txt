Mac Pro with fresh install of Ubuntu Server 14 will not boot <body> I installed Ubuntu Server 14 on my Mac Pro and now after a successful installation, when I tried to reboot it, the computer chimes like a Mac always does, but does not load any further.  Normally I would see a grey screen then code as ubuntu loads and finally I would be prompted with a password.  It does non of that, any idea why this would be, I had Ubuntu 12 running great however quite a few corrupt files caused the upgrade to 14 to fail, and I erased the harddrive back to empty, and did a fresh install of 14.  Everything seemed to go just fine until now.  What can or should I do to try and fix this.  EDIT: I now see the grey screen but then nothing happens after that  <answer156898> I was able to solve it by wiping the drive again, and reinstalling. Must have not installed correctly  <answer196464> I have problem, that loading stop. But I could load ubuntu in safe mode.  I solve issue by edit Grub config, as suggested here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacPro#Fixing_Grub. Actually I did only #3,4,5,6.  precode  # load ubuntu in safe mode or root console   vim /etc/default/grub   # change line in file to -&gt; GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset"   update-grub   shutdown -r now /code/pre  <comment183958> Hold down cmd + v when starting (verbose mode) where does it get hung up? <comment183962> I was able to solve it by wiping the drive again, and reinstalling.  Must have not installed correctly <comment183964> wana make that a answer so we can move on.
