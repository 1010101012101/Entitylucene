Why am I getting virus alert after clean formatting MacBook Pro 2014? <body> I recently clean formatted, erased everything on the hard drive of, my MacBook Pro 2014 and installed OS X El Capitan.  I also installed Sophos Aniti-Virus, but Sophos is detecting Android Apperhand virus in my clean installed Mac.  The alert is showing everytime my MacBook Pro logs in. Later it vanished from the Sophos Quarantine Manager!  I have attached the snapshot below. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EL1y8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer234579> The virus was in a folder in googledrive.   So after formatting and not installing google drive the virus warning doesnt show.  I deleted the folder from google drive so it no longer shows the virus even after installing google drive  <comment253806> If you open the quarantine manager does is show that you downloaded it from iCloud or in a mail attachment? I wouldn't expect an android program run, but it would be good to know from whence it came. <comment253834> @bmike I dont know, but it shows everytime I login to my macbook and vanishes automatically in a few seconds
