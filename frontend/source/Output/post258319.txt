Get precise and accurate GPS coordinates from iPhone <body> I'm looking for a way (an iPhone app) to help me get as precise and accurate GPS coordinates for my current location as possible. Currently I'm using this app:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-gps-coordinates/id945482414  …and saving coordinates 5 times (with pauses in between) to a note and then afterward calculating a mean of those values for better precision. And sure enough, this works…  However, I'm about to go out and do this to roughly 80 locations in cold weather and I'd prefer not to have to click (neither on location nor at home afterwards) so much and was thinking: isn't there an app in which you can just click on "Get coordinates" and it'll do what I described above, strongautomatically/strong? By that I mean repeatedly sampling current GPS coordinates and then presenting the mean for higher precision and accuracy?  Thanks!  <comment322906> What are you doing that you feel the need to take 5 readings at any given location? On the surface it sounds rather suspicious. <comment322907> Suspicious? In what way? If you must know I'm recording positions for the remains of up to a hundred crofts (I guess that'd be the closest English word for it), many of them left for hundreds of years to be overgrown by the nearby forest and thereby in many cased very hard to find. When doing this I've often found that individual measurements are **far** less reliable than a mean of say 5.
