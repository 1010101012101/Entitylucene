Strange behaviour of Finder, opens a closed tab over and over <body> I'm facing a strange behaviour on my El Captain MacBook, when I'm closing all tabs and I click on Finder to open a new Finder window but a very past closed tab is opening and every method I tried, failed to make it go away. I've tried Finder preferences to set it to open a home directory in a new tab but no success to make it go away.
