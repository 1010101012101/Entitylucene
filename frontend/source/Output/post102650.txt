How to recover file from Trash <body> Windows user here. How am I supposed to recover file without using a command line? I run Mac OS X 10.8.5  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ro3vE.png" alt="Trash"  <answer102651> Unfortunately there is no simple restore to original place.br What you do is copy the file from trash(Copy is on the pop up menu you show) and then navigate in Finder to where you want it to go and then paste it. If you have two Finder windows open you can drag and drop the file from Trash to where you want it.  <answer102652> I always thought that MacOSX had a Restore Option for individual files. The screenshot shows how to "undelete" a file. It will be moved back to its original location.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5fstj.png" alt="Put Back Trash"  <answer122687> h2Option 1/h2  ol liWith the item still in the Trash, strongright-click/strong on it with your mouse and select strongPut Back/strong.

Don't rely on it  <answer136739> Why simple when you can do it complicated.   You can just drag'n'drop it from Trash to where you wana have it (probably the Applications Folder cause it is an Application).  <comment120811> How do you get that option on the menu? <comment120813> I have this menu item on the very top, but it is greyed <comment120815> It is grayed out because to original location does not longer exist. <comment120819> @Mark I didn't do anything special. I simply put a file into the trash. <comment120821> It will not be there if the original location does not exist anymore. <comment120908> Why do you fear the command line? <comment154451> What if you dont know where to put it? Using disksweep, it isn't clear where they are from.... <comment174265> Maybe this is available only for single files? I have accidentally deleted a complete folder structure (more than 30k files over 1k folders) which I would like to "Put Back"
