Bluetooth version on mac <body> I updated my early 2015 retina Macbook Pro 13" to macOS Sierra. In system information and in the menubar (see pic) the bluetooth version is 5.0.0 is it just a driver version or do i now have bluetooth 5?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2kp7k.png" alt="In danish"  <answer253726> The Macbook pro 13" (early 2015) has Bluetooth 4.0 . You are watching the driver version.
