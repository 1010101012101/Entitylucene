Force a file to overwrite instead of appending <body> I've got an application that won't overwrite a file with the same filename. It will only append the filename with a 'space 1'. If I write a file more than once I get something like this:  ul lifilename.jpg/li lifilename 1.jpg/li lifilename 2.jpg/li /ul  What I need is to only ever have the newest file without the extra space and number.  Is there anyway around this? Perhaps an applescript running in the folder?  <answer9938> The application is in complete control of how it saves files (overwrite v. append). The answer is to pre-clean your destination before you start whatever work flow you are doing in Capture One. There are any number of ways to accomplish that.   ul liuse the coderm/code command from the terminal/li liwrite a bash script that does something more complicated/li liwrite an applescript/li licreate a new folder each time to point the application at/li licreate a disk image via Disk Utility that you can clone and throw away when finished/li /ul  These are just some of the ideas. I am sure there are other ways as well. Just need to find one that works for you.  A final thought, contact the makers of Capture One and make a case for why you would like them to change the software. Perhaps they will listen. :)  Good luck.  <comment10239> What is the application? <comment10264> Capture One from Phase One. <comment10301> Does anyone know what this phenomenon is called? <comment10311> Cross-posted ([tsk, tsk](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/is-it-possible-to-post-questions-across-a-couple-of-the-sites-because-its-debata)) to SU as [#254915](http://superuser.com/questions/254915/force-a-file-to-overwrite-instead-of-appending-the-filename).
