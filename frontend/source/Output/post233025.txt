How to overlay multiple graphs from Apple Health data <body> With Apple Health in iOS 9, how can I see the interaction between multiple data categories? For example, if I enter data for menstruation and sexual activity, it would be nice to see a graph with both of those overlaid on one another.  <answer240625> The feature you're describing doesn't exist in the Health app. However, it's possible there's some App Store app that reads such data from HealthKit and can display a combined chart.
