What is $HOME/.gnupb_work directory? <body> I'm currently using macOS 10.12.3 and gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.19. I found a directory code$HOME/.gnupb_work/code. What is it? Is it related to GnuPG? Google search found nothing. How do I find out if it's safe to delete it?  <comment350665> Gnu(PG)publickey_work? gnupb seems to be related to GnuPG as well as [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/). Please check the creation/modified date of the folder and the installation date (or key creation date) of your GnuPG pkg.
