Keyboard and Touchpad temporarily deactivate, all else working <body> This has started happening several times today. Lasting for 20 seconds or so, the keyboard and touchpad on my Macbook Pro stop responding to inputs. Everything else is working fine and I can see movement on my screen. I'm running the latest Mountain Lion, and I think this may have something to do with it:  precode1/10/12 12:58:01.173 PM com.apple.SecurityServer[20]: Session 100032 created 1/10/12 12:58:03.363 PM mdworker[3501]: Unable to talk to lsboxd 1/10/12 12:58:03.381 PM mdworker[3499]: Unable to talk to lsboxd 1/10/12 12:58:03.397 PM mdworker[3500]: Unable to talk to lsboxd 1/10/12 12:58:03.451 PM sandboxd[3502]: ([3501]) mdworker(3501) deny mach-lookup com.apple.ls.boxd 1/10/12 12:58:03.457 PM sandboxd[3502]: ([3499]) mdworker(3499) deny mach-lookup com.apple.ls.boxd 1/10/12 12:58:03.464 PM sandboxd[3502]: ([3500]) mdworker(3500) deny mach-lookup com.apple.ls.boxd 1/10/12 12:58:03.000 PM kernel[0]: Sandbox: sandboxd(3502) deny mach-lookup com.apple.coresymbolicationd 1/10/12 12:58:21.779 PM postfix/qmgr[1368]: warning: connect to transport private/retry: Connection refused 1/10/12 12:58:49.000 PM kernel[0]: USBF:    10675.120   AppleUSBEHCI[0xffffff80161fe000]::Found a transaction which hasn't moved in 5 seconds on bus 0xfa, timing out!

The likely culprit isn't software (though you could try using an external keyboard/mouse and attempt to reproduce) but hardware. The top case's USB connection is likely failing.  <answer195758> I finally fixed this on my 13" MacBook Pro early 2011. The cause was a solder failure in the Airport/WiFi ribbon cable.  Diagnosis steps:   ol liboot up the MacBook on a solid, flat surface/li liopen the Applications  Utilities  Console.app/li liwait for the console messages to stop/li lipick up the MacBook as you normally do. In particular, experiment with pressure in the center of the bottom of the MacBook. This is where several ribbon cables connect to the logic board./li liwatch the console; if you start seeing codeAppleUSBEHCI/code timeout messages then you have tweaked the hardware somehow to induce the problem/li liopen up the System Report; select codeUSB/code and see if any devices are missing. In my case, codeBluetooth USB Host Controller/code disappeared after I picked up my MacBook, so this pointed to the USB/WiFi connector/li /ol  Workaround: once you have the MacBook on a stable surface, you can usually restore trackpad/keyboard function by plugging something into the USB port (USB stick, mouse, etc...)  Fix: replace the Bluetooth/WiFi ribbon cable (in my case; you may have a different failed cable).   <comment77463> this [particular log entry](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4352126?start=0&tstart=0) doesn't seem to have to do with your problem; it is related to Spotlight and I have these same messages without my keyboard freezing. can you post more logs entries? <comment77491> I've posted a more complete log of what happened during that issue, but I suspect there are too many suspects to choose from. <comment81569> Which model MacBook Pro? 2010? MacBookPro5,2 here. <comment98864> The [accepted answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/35970/8546) to [Timeouts in AppleUSBEHCI - how can I find out what is causing this?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/35927/8546) may help you to identify devices affected by timeouts.
