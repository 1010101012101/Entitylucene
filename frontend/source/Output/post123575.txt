Accidentally almost deleted iPhoto library <body> I was emptying out folders and deleting unnecessary items and as I went to my pictures folder I simply just dragged everything to the trash not knowing that my whole iPhoto library was there.  When I hit empty trash a couple of seconds later I had realized what I had done and I hit cancel as it was in the process of deleting. Now when I try to open iPhoto it says "Your photo library is either in use by another application or has become unreadable". When I look at my picture space, it still basically has all the GB there, just a few missing.  Are my pictures still retrievable?  <answer123576> If you purely want to salvage your photos, then this is the easiest way without any other software.  ol liRight-click on the iPhoto Library file and select strongShow Package Contents/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ojDKx.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liFind the strongMasters/strong folder and copy it somewhere, like your emDesktop/em img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcWDv.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liHold down kbdAlt/Option/kbd key and open iPhoto again. This will bring up this window img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FtnIy.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect strongNew Library/strong and import all the photos from the emMasters/em folder that you copied to your Desktop in step #2/li /ol  This should work, and create a new library with any photos that are still intact.
