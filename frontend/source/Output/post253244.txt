Inverse trigonometric functions in Calculator <body> Is there a way to calculate inverse trigonometric functions in El Capitan's Calculator (ie. arcsine, arccosine, arctangent, etc.)? I've tried the usual alt, cmd, ctrl modifiers with the sin/cos/tan buttons to no avail. I'm especially annoyed because Spotlight does calculate arctangents and the result is claimed to come from Calculator itself, so I don't know if they dumbed the interface down or what.  Examples of operations that work from Spotlight but I have no clue how to do from Calculator:  precodeatan(1)  # arctangent of 1 in radians atand(1) # arctangent of 1 in degrees /code/pre  <answer253247> Hit the shift key strongin/strong Calculator in older versions of OS X to get all inverse trigonometric but also some other functions:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/za8tu.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qRl2D.png" alt="enter image description here"  In El Capitan it works with the "2nd" button (the real keyboard's shift key should work as well):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pDK04.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5u9C.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253279> To calculate strongatan()/strong and strongatand()/strong in strongCalculator/strong under OS X El Capitan, do the following…  ol liOpen strongCalculator/strong./li liPress kbdcommand/kbdkbd2/kbd on the  Mac’s keyboard, to show the strongScientific Calculator/strong./li liTo calculate eminverse trigonometric functions/em, click the strong2supnd/sup/strong button em(left side, second row, first button)/em on the calculator (or you can press and hold the kbdshift/kbd key on the Mac’s keyboard during a given operation) in order to change the strongtan/strong button to display as: strongtan sup-1/sup/strong/li liTo change between calculating emdegrees/em and emradians/em, toggle the button in the lower left corner of the strongScientific Calculator/strong between strongDeg/strong and strongRad/strong.  ul liThe default is to calculate emdegrees/em and the strongRad/strong button is shown./li liTo  calculate emradians/em, click the strongRad/strong button so it shows strongDeg/strong.

But `shift` did not. Any idea why? I'm expecting the buttons to switch to their alternate functions while I keep it pressed, but nothing happens.
