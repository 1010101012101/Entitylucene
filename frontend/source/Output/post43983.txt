Displaying combined file size of selected files in Finder <body> To find details about a files size, you can right click and select "Get Info":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UsZGK.png" alt="Get Info Window"  When I select a large number of files, and want to get information about all if them together as a single selection, such as the combined total size, I get the same window for every individual selection, and not a single view for the selection as a whole.  How can I get total file sizes for file/folder selections?  <answer43985> Instead of kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdI/kbd use kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdI/kbd to see the info:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xjm5K.png" alt="enter image description here"  kbdCmd/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdI/kbd does something similar, but gives you a static emSummary Info/em window which doesn't update as your selection changes, and you can open multiple windows for different selections, which is handy for comparing groups of synced folders for example.  <answer280749> Exapnding on the same, I tried Alt- Right Click and it worked quite well.  <comment49990> Yup, that's it!! <comment49991> @daviesgeek I actually didn't know this before. But I always try the option key when looking for new features. <comment49994> The Option key really is incredibly undervalued and versatile...  Must re-watch the great Screencast for tips. <comment54028> Cmd-Ctrl-I does something similar, but gives you a static "Summary Info" window (doesn't update as selection changes) and you can open multiple windows for different selections. Handy for comparing groups of synced folders. <comment54029> Thanks @joelseph I will edit that into the existing answer if it's OK by you - very useful <comment54030> @stuffe Fine by me â€” I guess I could've done that in the first place :) <comment258898> Yet another example of where Windows Explorer is far ahead of OSX Finder <comment342945> VERY helpful answer.
