How do I remove the updatetoolnotifier from launchctl? <body> Over a year ago I was working with the Glassfish app server. It apparently installed an "update notifier" that occasionally checks for updates and presents a dialog like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0Pfl.png" alt="app update image"  Since I'm no longer using this server (go Tomcat!) I'd like to stop getting these update messages. Through some codeps -f/code spelunking I see that it's running  precode/Users/myusername/Library/Application Support/updatetool/notifier /code/pre  and that the parent pid launching it is codelaunchctl/code. I'm aware that I can just blow away the $HOME/glassfish dir, or perhaps the codeupdatetool/code dir, but that would leave behind whatever bits are telling codelaunchctl/code to run its occasional updates. I'd prefer a clean removal.  I see that it's running with the following:  precode$ launchctl list | grep -i update 494 -   [0x0-0x3c03c].net.java.updatecenter.updatetoolnotifier /code/pre  In the past I've tried removing the entry via   precodelaunchctl remove [0x0-0x3c03c].net.java.updatecenter.updatetoolnotifier /code/pre  But that seems to have no effect; it always comes back. How can I remove Glassfish cleanly, and prevent it from trying to update itself after removal?  <comment40875> By "it always comes back" do you mean that the launchd job is deleted and then reappears? <comment40887> @eyemth- yes. I delete it, it appears gone, and then a week later it's back.
