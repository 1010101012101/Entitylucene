Is there a way i can get Notifications for reminders inside of Sierra to behave how they did inside of Yosemite? <body> Ive got 2 macs, one running Yosemite and one ive just upgraded to Sierra.   I use the inbuilt reminders app on both of them.   In Yosemite when i get a notification i get 2 options : Done &amp; Snooze.  In Sierra when i get a notification i get 2 options : Complete &amp; Later.   In Sierra when i click "Later" it always wants me to set a time for the notification to re appear which is A) an extra click each time when i want to set something for later and B) i have to think about when i would like to set it for in the future.  In Yosemite i could just hit Snooze and the notification would come back at a later time.   Is there a way i can get Notifications for reminders inside of Sierra to behave how they did inside of Yosemite ?
