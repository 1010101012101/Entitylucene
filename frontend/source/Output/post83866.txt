Is it safe to delete the /Developer folder on Mac OS X 10.7.5 (Lion)? <body> My computer originally had Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) installed on it but has since been upgraded to OS X 10.7 (Lion). I noticed that the code/Developer/code folder is still on the hard drive even though none of its files emappear/em to have been modified for nearly two years. Is it safe to delete code/Developer/code or is there some reason to keep it around?  Chris Rea's answer includes a link to a guide to uninstall Xcode, which seems to suggest that the contents of code/Developer/code are only used by versions of Xcode prior to 4.3. I have already installed Xcode 4.6 on my machine, so I should be able to remove code/Developer/code and everything under it. That being said, the following statement in the aforementioned guide puzzled me a bit.   precodesudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=xcodedir /code/pre      This command is basically a shortcut to the previously mentioned “/Developer/Library/uninstall-developer-folder” script. If you want to ditch the /Developer directory, run this command rather than manually deleting it through the Finder.   Why should I run this script instead of simply deleting code/Developer/code through the Finder?  This question is related, but I don't want to fully remove Xcode 4. I just want to remove all traces of Xcode that are not needed by the latest version.  <answer83868> Did you already upgrade your Xcode to a newer version, one stored under code/Applications/code? If you upgraded to a newer Xcode stored in the new location and also installed the updated Command Line Tools from within Xcode, then what you have under the root code/Developer/code folder is likely all stale and you can probably safely delete code/Developer/code.  strongTo be safe,/strong archive the folder elsewhere for the time being, then nuke it later when you are confident you don't need it.  If you did emnot/em install the more recent Xcode, I'm guessing the contents under code/Developer/code may still be "in effect."  Have a look at this guide to uninstall the developer tools in that case.  Make sure your environment variables don't refer to any paths within the folder.  <answer83874> If you have Xcode 4.3 or later, it should be safe to remove this file. Apple elaborates on it here:   What's New in Xcode  <answer83876> Yes, it looks like it should be safe to remove code/Developer/code if you have already installed version 4.3 or later of Xcode. The Xcode section of the Apple Developer Support Center actually tells you to do this (emphasis mine).     h2I've installed the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store, but a previous version of Xcode (4.2.1 or earlier) keeps launching. What should I do?/h2      hr      To run the latest version of Xcode, make sure you are launching Xcode.app from the Applications folder. Xcode 4.3 and later is packaged on the Mac App Store as a single application and installs in your Applications folder as Xcode.app.      strongPrevious versions of Xcode placed the tools and frameworks in the Developer folder. You can delete the older version of Xcode by dragging the Developer folder to the trash./strong   Furthermore, as pointed out by bispymusic, code/Developer/code no longer exists with Xcode 4.3. Specifically (emphasis mine):     strongThe simplification afforded by repackaging Xcode 4.3 as a single app bundle eliminates the need for the code/Developer/code directory containing prior versions of Xcode./strong As a result, strongthe Install Xcode application and the codeuninstall-devtools/code command line script are also no longer needed./strong      strongNote:/strong The first time you run Xcode 4.3, you are prompted with a dialog to delete the Install Xcode application from the Applications directory if one is resident, and to remove any older installation of Xcode (Figure 4). These actions are optional, strongXcode 4.3 can co-exist with older installations of Xcode on the same Mac./strong Some operations may require an administrator password to enable them if you switch from one version of Xcode to another.      strongFigure 4/strong  Option to remove older versions of Xcode      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQ85i.jpg" alt="Xcode screenshot"      If you choose not to delete these items on the first launch of Xcode 4.3, strongyou can remove the code/Developer/code folder and the Install Xcode application by dragging them to the Trash at any time./strong   <comment96523> Yes, I've already installed the latest version of Xcode, but it doesn't look like I've installed the Command Line Tools yet. I'll do that now. Are there some path variables that I can check to ensure that the appropriate command-line tools are being referenced? (For what it's worth, `xcode-select -print-path` is returning `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.)
