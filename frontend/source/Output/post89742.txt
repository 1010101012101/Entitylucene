How can I edit translated video on a Mac? <body> There is a movie on my Macbook which has some some inappropriate scenes that I want to edit so I can watch the movie with my family.   I know how to cut scenes (trim) using Quicktime but this will confuse the translation timing on the film (.srt file)  I am wondering how to make the scene freeze (fixed) while the unwanted scene is playing or better, a program that would adjust the timing of the subtitles to match scenes cut so that we didn't have to fast forward through whatever the "censored" still frames look like?  <answer93532> I use SubMerge to load and sync subtitles to movies. I generally look for subtitles in SRT format. You can usually edit the subtitles texts inserting (or removing), pauses or blanks. A difficult part is that it's not uncommon for subtitles to slowly get out of sync with the film as the latter progresses. Adding - or removing text is really handy to restore synchronization. It is a bit of a laborious process though :)  Once I have the stuff in sync, then I too use Handbrake to change formats if necessary. Hope this helps.  <comment105449> The best suggestion I have is to hard-code the subtitles using a tool like Handbrake. Once the subtitles are hard-coded you will no longer need the .srt file, and you should be able to use QuickTime or iMovie to chop the file up. The only downside is that hard-coding will cause the film to be re-encoded an additional time, which could result in a slight quality loss. <comment105479> well quality is really matters to me :) and i think hard coding will take hours (as i heard) specially for MKV files .. anyway thank you so much for your replay i really appreciate it <comment107696> Just use iMovie to insert a black image or whatever you like without changing the duration. There is  Windows app called SubRip that can adjust the timing +/- by X seconds. So it would be a good deal of manual labor, but you could make that adjustment once for each scene, and export a new srt file. <comment109682> I have no experience in this area but http://stackexchange.com/search?q=edit+srt+subtitle finds what may be some useful answers under questions such as [How to correct / shift subtitle time in SRT (SubRip) files?](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12864047/38108) and [What subtitle file editor for '.srt' files supports synchronization?](http://superuser.com/q/49245/84988) <comment109902> thank you all .. still have some problems ill try to fix it otherwise ill come back here
