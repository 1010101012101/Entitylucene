How do I remove a "missing" MP3 file from my iPhone? <body> I have an MP3 file located on my iPhone that I want to delete but am unable to find in the Music app.  The track only appears when I connect my iPhone to my Mac and go to (Devices  iPhone  Music) in iTunes. There, it shows a list of all of my voice memos and songs in my music library. I have already deleted all of the songs from my music library using (Settings  General  Usage  Music...) on my iPhone, but it did not delete the file in question. I know absolutely for certain that it is not a voice memo.  There is now a circle with an exclamation mark next to the file in iTunes, but secondary clicking on it does not offer a remove or delete option. Does anyone have any suggestions on removing the file?  <answer285737> Do you or have you ever used iTunes to sync the phone?  If so, try another sync.   <answer285969> Have you tried to reset iTunes cache?  precodeiTunes -&gt; Peferences -&gt; Advanced /code/pre  As an option go to codeAbout this mac -&gt; Storage/code click codeManageâ€¦/code and then select codeiTunes/code. Perhaps those file will be there.  <answer286140> If you've already tried the other answers, back up your iPhone &amp; then restore it in iTunes - this will almost certainly fix this issue.  <answer286147> I managed to successfully remove the listing by downloading the iOS file explorer iFunbox and poking around inside of the iPhone's raw filesystem.  The process I took was rather unscientific, but after deleting many of the files and directories located in directories such as Downloads, MediaAnalysis, and Music and iTunes-related folders, the bad listing disappeared.  My suspicion is that the file was appearing because of a bad SQL entry, and that deleting all of the .sqlite files fixed the problem.  <comment360560> Yes, I have synced repeatedly. <comment360954> Yes. Sorry, but no dice. <comment360955> Performing a full backup to the computer then restoring the iPhone to the backup did not solve the issue. <comment360970> Hmm. Is the file taking up space on the iPhone? It doesn't seem like it's actually there, which is an issue with iTunes if so
