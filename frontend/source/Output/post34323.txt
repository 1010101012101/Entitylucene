Mac terminal cd to folder IN current directory <body> Let say my current directory in terminal is code~/Users/Desktop/code. On my desktop, there's a folder called code"sample_dir"/code. How can I cd in this code"sample_dir"/code folder with typing: code"cd ~/Users/Desktop/sample_dir"/code? There's gotta be a shorter way that looks at your current directory and appends that path to the directory you pass in to make things faster.  Thanks  <answer34324> Typing cd sample_dir should work... check "pwd" to make sure the current path is what you expect.  <answer34325> I usually type strongcodecd/code/strong, then drag the folder (from Finder) that I want to open in Terminal, and drop it in Terminal. This will add the full directory path, then press enter to change to the dropped directory.  <answer34326> There is. Type:  precodecd sample_dir /code/pre  It checks for you. If for some strange reason that doesn't work, type:  precodecd ./sample_dir /code/pre  <answer34333> The path you are using codecd ~/Users/Desktop/sample_dir/code is wrong.  If you have a folder named codesample_dir/code in you user's codeDesktop/code directory then the full path to the directory is:  precodecd /Users/YourUserName/Desktop/sample_dir /code/pre  Where codeYourUserName/code is the the short account username. Using the tilde ~ shortcut to your home directory this can be shortened to   precodecd ~/Desktop/sample_dir /code/pre  When you open a new terminal session you start in your home directory, so:  precodecd Desktop/sample_dir /code/pre  <answer208334> cd Desktop/sample_dir  should work :)
