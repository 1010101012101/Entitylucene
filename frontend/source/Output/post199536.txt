How to keep original "date created" when copying via Terminal? <body> There are many questions online asking how to make the commands codersync/code and codecp/code go about copying a file while keeping the "date created" attribute the same as the original instead of the time of copy. I understand this is Mac's added information and is separate from the file's strongmetadata/strong "date created" attribute. Anyways, as I played around with codersync -a/code, it did everything I wanted except, as everyone online notes, it changed the "date created" to the time of copy instead of original make. With codersync/code and codecp/code it changes due to "a change to the inode". Command-c command-v, however, keeps the "date created" time the same.  strongHere's my question:/strong How is it that kbdCmd/kbd-kbdC/kbd kbdCmd/kbd-kbdV/kbd keeps the date created attribute the same on the copy, yet no command in the terminal will yield this result? If kbdCmd/kbd-kbdC/kbd kbdCmd/kbd-kbdV/kbd can do it, it seems there has to be some command in the Terminal that replicates this?  <answer199574> As stated POSIX does not define "date created" and command line tools are written to POSIX standards but may extend the standards. The behavior of rsync and cp are what is expected. Some file systems and kernels extend the standards and include birthtime or btime.  Assuming you are copying files to the same file system then OS X has tools that will attempt to preserve birthtime ("date created"). You could use codepax/code or codehardlink/code files and the "date created" will be preserved. Less reliable tools are codeditto/code or codecp/code with the codep/code option (at least on my system, I suspect bugs in HFS+).  If you want to copy files to another file system then you need to  compile rsync with the patches fileflags, crtimes, hfs-compression and rsync can handle OS X metadata and preserve the original file's birthtime on the new file.  <answer199578> On 10.10.4, using strongcp -p /path/to/source /path/to/destination/strong the time created is preserved. More specifically, in Finder, emdate created/em and emdate modified/em are preserved, while emdate added/em will have the copy time.  <comment240241> Where did you verify whether the dates change or stay the same, in Terminal or in Finder? As can be easily verified using `stat -s`, even Cmd-C/Cmd-V changes `ctime` and `ctime` information, so which timestamps do you want to stay the same here? <comment240244> If XCode is installed Getfilinfo file returns the file info. See https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/GetFileInfo.1.html <comment240289> 'NIX does not have a "date created" attribute (unlike Windows). `st_ctime` in the struct stat actually records the last time the inode changed.   OS X 64 bit has `st_birthtimespec; /* time of file creation(birth) */` but accessing this is not straightforward. <comment240309> Patrix: is there a way to view "stat -s name of file" with yyyy/mm/dd format for each date returned? And I am trying to get Finder's "created" date to stay the same. <comment240310> Scott and Milliways, thank you, I do not have much time right now, I'll check your answers later today. <comment240431> Ok, you're right, when copying files from one location on my mac to another, rsync keeps the "date created" the same. I forgot to mention that I'm copying files from my mac to a Seagate hard drive. This is where command-c command-v keeps the "date created" the same yet rsync -av does not.
