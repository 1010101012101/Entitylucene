MacBook Pro 11,3 with dual Dell P2715Q 27" Monitors <body> I have two Dell P2715Q 27" external monitors I want to connect to my 15" MacBook Pro 11,3 with OSX 10.10.2 ordered around September 2014. I've tried connecting it as follows:  note: tb = thunderbolt, dp = displayport, mdp = mini displayport  h2First try/h2  ul litb 1 - Dell P2715Q #1 dp in - Dell P2715Q #1 dp out - Dell P2715Q #2 mdp in/li /ul  In this case the two Dell screens will only mirror, and OS X does not seem to recognize that there are actually two displays attached.  h2Second try/h2  ul lithunderbolt 1 - Dell P2715Q #1 displayport in/li lithunderbolt 2 - Dell P2715Q #2 displayport in/li /ul  In this case one screen will go on, but the other remains black and says there is no signal.  h2side note/h2  I also have an older 1920x1200 Dell display I want to use via HDMI for a total of 3 external displays, but I need to get an HDMI cable plus the first two screens working first.  <answer175284> from monitor menu (the buttons) change the MST setting to Primary and Secondary accordingly  <comment204777> maybe see http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/macbook-pro-retina-display-faq/macbook-pro-retina-display-how-to-manually-switch-graphics.html#extdisplays I'm not sure really if that's saying they both need to be TB displays. For sure you cannot chain DP displays, only TB <comment206804> Ok, I see the MST setting, but how do I wire it and which computer do I set to what? I also found the apple info on 4k displays, which is somewhat useful. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202856 <comment259862> Did you ever get this working? I'm considering the same setup.
