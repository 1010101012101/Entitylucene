iPhone: What is `accountsd` and why is it using 80% CPU? <body> I just got a new iPhone 6 for my SO and noticed that it is quite toasty to handle with the battery draining quite fast.  It has been 24 hours since I first set it up.  I plugged it into Instruments and loaded the Activity Monitor and noticed that codeaccountsd/code is chewing through 80% of the CPU:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kgdp1.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongWhat is codeaccountsd/code on iOS and why is it chewing up so much CPU?/strong  <answer171123> Accountsd and cloudd manage iCloud. There's an insanely annoying bug which lots of people have where a sign into icloud password prompt comes up every few seconds and you can't sign out of find my phone.  <comment182666> It might be trying to gain access to the keychain on iCloud. Means the keychain needs to be repaired. <comment182743> @Buscarì›ƒ A restart seems to have resolved the issue, but I am still curious what `accountsd` does on iOS. <comment316007> It syncs accounts and managed them and their secrets (credentials). Most commonly AppleID and email accounts, but also instant messaging and social networks.
