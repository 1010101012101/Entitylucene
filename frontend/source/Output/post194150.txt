How to jump to album in iOS 8.4 Music app? <body> I've updated to iOS 8.4, and on the revamped Music app, I can't jump to artist. In previous versions, I could be playing a shuffle playlist and whenever I'm on some song and I wanted to keep playing from that album, I could simply tap the top right button and it would jump me to the currently playing song's album. Now, when I'm playing a song in a shuffle playlist, I see that button has been placed next to seek controls (previous, play/pause, next buttons), but when I tap that, it doesn't take me to the album anymore, it takes me to playlist.  How can I jump to album when playing a song from shuffle? It was a feature that I was using passively, but now I can't find it and I'm having quite hard time jumping to song's album, which I did ema lot/em.  <answer194159> ol liThe currently playing song shows up in a horizontal now playing bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLSkx.jpg" width="320" title="Now playing"/li liClick the three dots on the right hand side of the bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ppDAW.jpg" width="320" title="Three dots"/li liClick on the album name at the top of the pop up menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Niy2.jpg" width="320" title="Jump to album"/li /ol  <answer197770> There is a bug "Unknown Album" if you do that on an Apple Music track.   <comment231525> Oh, didn't notice that album art was tappable. Yes, it is exactly what I was looking for, thanks. <comment231528> Yeah this was a neat trick I learned after being frustrated by the same issue. Tapping on the artist name in that menu will take you to the artist page. However, there seems to be a bug where sometimes it'll redirect you to an "Unknown Artist" page. <comment240679> ran into this topic looking to see if anyone else had this issue.  Thanks.
