Bring preview to front when opening pdf from finder <body> When I open a pdf file from finder, how can I make Preview jump to the front with the file I want?  Currently what is happening is that I open the file, but Preview remains behind the Finder windows.  I am sure that this problem is new in my computer, since otherwise I would have noticed earlier (this is really annoying).  Thanks in advance.  <comment279387> Does it still do it after a reboot?
