How to disable Address Book Server in Mac OS X? <body> I have a huge codeerror.log/code file in code/private/var/log/carddavd/code folder. I found out that the Address Book Server creates logs in this folder.  Can anyone suggest me a way to disable the Address Book Server so I don't have to worry about these log files in the future?  Edit - the issue is only with OSX Servers.  <comment116485> I don't have a carddav account added to my address book and don't have this folder. Maybe simply disabling the specific carddav account solves your problem? <comment116487> Are you running stock OS X or the Server additions also? <comment116488> Updated question.
