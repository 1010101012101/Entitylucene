Compiling a gimp plugin statically <body> I downloaded a binary-only copy of Gimp from the official website, and also the source for the batch-processing plugin dbp, with a view to building and installing the latter on my Mac (10.6.x). To do so, I needed to install gimp2-devel to satisfy dependencies, which (since I had macports installed already) was fairly easy.  The plugin now works inside both the binary version as well as the development (macports) version, but if I uninstall (or port deactivate) the latter, the plugin stops working in the former. Whilst a compiled plugin is not meant to be executed from the CLI, nevertheless if it is working fine it will just print out a short message and then exit. However with gimp2-devel missing, it outputs this:  precode./dbp dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libgimpui-2.0.0.dylib   Referenced from: /Users/jon/Library/Application Support/Gimp/plug-ins/./dbp   Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap /code/pre  Now, I would like to be able to offer this plugin binary on my website, for use with the binary-only copy of Gimp, to save non-tech users from having to install macports and compile stuff manually. But to do this I need to modify the plugin compilation stage so that dependencies are included in the 'dbp' binary. I am not a C++ programmer though, so I wouldn't know what flags to adjust in the Makefile:  precodeGIMPARGS = $(shell pkg-config --cflags --libs gimpui-2.0) NODEPS = -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED g++ -o dbp -Wall -O2 -I. *.cc $(GIMPARGS) $(NODEPS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) /code/pre  If anyone can offer any pointers, I should much appreciate it!  <comment23769> I have found a solution to my problem, though not one I was looking for. Rather than compiling statically, I have made the compiled dependencies available to users to install themselves and symlinking from /opt/local/lib/*. Not quite as simple as a single-file install, but it fixes the problem at hand and it's not too complicated for non-technical users. More details [here](http://blog.jondh.me.uk/2011/07/davids-batch-processor-on-os-x/) if anyone is interested. <comment23770> Incidentally I tried to add this as answer, but I have insufficient rep points to do so immediately. Bah!
