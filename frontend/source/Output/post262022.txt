How to batch resize/rename recursively in a collection of subfolders <body> There are many batch image resizers out there, but they all seem to either resize the original or create a resized copy in a different location. Starting with a folder that contains many subfolders and files, I'd like to make resized (enlarged) copies of the specific images (they all share the same name pattern) that are each in the same location as the original, and perform this as a batch on a folder with a large number of subfolders.  In other words, I have a directory with many subfolders, and within some of the subfolders are 3 files with a specific set of file names. For example,   precodeLevel1 ├── TopicA │   └── Screenshots │       └── iOS │           ├── iPad_1.png │           ├── iPad_2.png │           └── iPad_3.png └── TopicB     └── Screenshots         └── iOS             ├── iPad_1.png             ├── iPad_2.png             └── iPad_3.png /code/pre  I'd like to take Level1 folder and automate the following on all matching files in any subfolder: Locate files matching the desired file name, duplicate, resize (200% scale) and rename to iPadPro_1.png, iPadPro_2.png, iPadPro_3.png  In the end, the original files will be unchanged, and in the same location as EACH original, there will be a new file with "Pro" after "iPad" (iPadPro_1.png, iPadPro_2.png, iPadPro_3.png) that are each 200% scale of the originals.  If this can be done with Automator, great, although I'm also open to purchasing existing software if it can do this.
