I cannot install the Tiled Map Editor on Mac OS X 10.6.8 <body> I am attempting to install Tiled Map Editor, a cross-platform open-source application that uses the QT application framework. It is used in game design.  When I attempt to install it, I get this error message:     You can't open the application Qt SDK Installer because it is not   supported on this type of Mac   How can I resolve this problem? I am using Mac OS X 10.6.8.  <answer22643> It would be helpful to know which version of OS X you're running.   ul liYou must have Xcode installed on your machine./li liIt's possible you have downloaded the 64bit version./li liVerify you have the correct version./li /ul  <answer22645> Check to see if the application you are using is Intel supported. I don't know why a PPC application strongwouldn't/strong run on an Intel, but try clicking on the application, go to FileGet Info, and under GeneralKind, check to see what the application kind is.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3BByZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment25215> I have updated the OS version in my question <comment25217> You should be fine with your OS version, so the next question is do you have Xcode installed? <comment25218> Yas i have installed xcode <comment25219> In my file-get info, "Kind = Disk Image", Is it correct and thanks for your feedback guys:) <comment25220> I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you were installing it from a dmg.
