Is there a way to insert automator output at the cursor? <body> I have a simple script that generates different output every time it's run (e.g. generate a UUID).  Is there a way to write an automator script that simply inserts the output of a script at the current cursor location?  (I want to run this service from Thunderbird, if that makes a difference.)  <answer264490> Could your automator script copy the output to clipboard and then run this script to paste the clipboard contents?  precodedo shell script "pbpaste &gt; /path/to/your/clipboard-file.txt" /code/pre  This topic covers the paste function in more detail https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9976338/applescript-to-paste-text-from-clipboard-into-a-file  <comment331495> This would insert the clipboard into the file, but would do so by replacing the *entire* file with the clipboard contents. <comment331650> It's customary to explain why you're downvoting a post <comment331652> I'm already having my automator script write its output to the clipboard.
