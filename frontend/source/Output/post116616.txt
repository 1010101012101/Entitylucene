Changed DNS server, now can't connect to internet on Safari, Chrome or App Store <body> I'm using Mac 10.7.5. Attempting to speed up my internet connection, I downloaded namebench and changed my DNS server per the suggestion given by namebench.  After restarting my computer, I can no longer connect to the internet on Safari, Firefox, or the App Store, although Chrome works just fine. Is there anything else I need to configure to enable internet browsing on these browsers?  Btw, namebench recommended I use the nameserver code205.171.2.65/code.  <answer116968> I always use OpenDNS when troubleshooting DNS issues, try using 208.67.222.222 and/or 208.67.220.220 as your DNS servers on your computer. Alternatively, try setting the network interface on your computer back to auto-obtaining DNS servers from your router via DHCP.  System Preferences  Network  [Network Adapter being used (WiFi or Ethernet usually)]  Advanced  DNS tab  delete any manual entries under "DNS Servers" and you should see a few entries in light grey (those are given to your computer via DHCP) Then click "apply" and you should be all set  <comment136410> What happens if you change the DNS server back? <comment136421> Or, use the google nameserver 8.8.8.8 ?
