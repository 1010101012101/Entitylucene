Can I view a list of applications currently running background jobs in iOS? <body> A growing number of applications for iOS, especially those adjusted for iOS 7, support background tasks (so they complete a download or sync or whatever also if not in front).  Is there any chance to print a list of applications that are running background tasks (or have been currently), for example like the one used for location based services?  <answer102309> The only option I have found is in Settings - General - Background App Refresh that shows all apps that are currently capable and enabled to do the refreshing. Unfortunately there is no indication of which one was active recently.  <answer102488> I use iStat on all my systems. That gives me background and foreground apps as well as their resource usage. HTH  <comment120472> Hadn't found that yet, but at least partly solves the problem. I will wait for some more time, if there is no answer with information on recent tasks I will set this as accepted. Thank you! <comment120662> iStat can show which _iOS_ background applications are currently active? Could you add an example screenshot to your answer? I know some other tools, but they're not able to list any additional information to PID and priority... <comment120674> I probably shot off too quickly. I get resource information that I find very useful. I use iExplorer for app lists. There is also an IOS Activity Monitor, that maybe useful.. https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/system-activity-monitor/id306192663?mt=8 <comment120685> Seems they're all only giving lists of apps, but not which are currently active. I guess Apple is not offering an API allowing to do this... :( <comment120695> I found this one too: http://www.theappsware.com plays to mixed reviews though..
