Automator - Get name of dropped file without file type <body> I have a simple automator app that runs a python script on the file that is dropped on it. However, I need to also extract the name of the dropped file so that I can use it to create a directory name.  precodefor f in "$@" do     set myFileName to name of (item f of $@)     /usr/local/bin/python3 /Volumes/Scripts/script.py "$f"     mkdir myFileName (without extension?) done /code/pre  <answer284307> The first line of your script is Applescript whereas it should be shell (bash by default). The tersest version I can think of:  precodefor f in "$@" do     /usr/local/bin/python3 /Volumes/Scripts/script.py "$f"     mkdir ${f%.*} done /code/pre
