Copy selection to clipboard automatically <body> I am looking for a program that can copy any selected text to the clipboard automatically. E.g. if I select some text in Safari or Eclipse, it should automatically copy it to the keyboard.   hr  The Google Chrome extension Auto Copy 3.0.3 can do it in Google Chrome.  The application PopClip displays a popover menu which appears when some text is selected in any application but there doesn't seem to be any way to automatically copy it to the keyboard.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dzbTA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer163019> Copy Clip &amp; itâ€™ll sync with iOS devices, too.  <comment190776> Thanks. Does it copy any selected text to the clipboard automatically? ( I'm asking because I don't see it on the official website ) <comment190795> Have you looked into Automator or do you want a full fledged software application <comment190895> @soulshined An Automator script would be good too. Is it possible to trigger an Automator script upon text selection? Or else do you have in mind sending Command+C every second or so? <comment190902> you can do both, however the latter will be your more of a quick fix if you don't plan on using it outside of personal use. Triggering a script upon selection is doable but code heavy. You will have to invest time in to it. With applescript you write a quick script like this: tell application "System Events" keystroke "c" using command down end tell set theText to the clipboard and loop it indefinitely or run it every second as you suggested. <comment190903> I tried Copy Clip and from what I can see it does not copy the selected text to the clipboard automatically. <comment190912> Franck disregard that. If you choose to loop it its going to override your last execution so say you copy selected text and run it again a second from now then if there is no text selected it will create a nil string even though you copied something 2 sec ago. I wouldn't suggest looping. Create if statements <comment191058> My error, I meant to suggest CloudClip Manager (http://www.thinkbitz.com/cloudclip/). As long as it is running, it will keep a log of all copied text -- but this is saved to its own iOS app or Menulet not to the OS's clipboard. If you need everything saved to the built-in clipboard, you might search Lifehacker articles over the last 8 months or so as they've featured quite a few clipboard options. <comment372132> This does not do what OP asked.
