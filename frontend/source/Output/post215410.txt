OS X El-Capitan - /cores directory taking up a lot of space? <body> Im using a program called Daisy Disk to see what is taking up space in my Mac and I find that the /cores directory is taking up 77gb.   Is that a problem? Can I get rid of it to regain the space?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUdqK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer215413> Long story short, it's safe to delete them.  The code/cores/code folder is where OS X stores Core Dumps. These are files that are intended for developers to trouble-shoot and diagnose faults in their software. They are generated as software crashes. If you're not a developer, or aren't testing software for a developer, then these files serve no purpose for you.  The files contain the state of the memory (or RAM) in your Mac at the time the crash happened. So lots of useful information for developers or testers to debug crashes. Not much use to anyone else.  By default, OS X is set up not to generate core dump files. If you type codesudo launchctl limit core/code in a Terminal window it will respond with the soft and hard size limits of dump files it is allowed to create. Soft limit means the default for each process, however processes can change this if they require but only up to the value of the hard limit. By default the values in OS X seem to be "0 unlimited" means that the operating system won't create core dumps by default, but processes can elect to have unlimited core dump files created if they wish.  You can change the setting on your machine by simply entering codesudo launchctl limit core 0 0/code to disable the feature entirely. codesudo launchctl limit core 0 unlimited/code will restore the default behaviour if it has been changed.  <comment260200> Probably not worth it's own question… but how/why are they generated? Are they cleared with tools like Cocktail, running the rotate logs etc? Would they migrate to a new machine? Reason being, my /cores is empty & this machine is a true linear hand-me-down/migrate from about 2004. <comment260202> Updated my answer. Don't use Cocktail myself but it does have an option to clear "Core files" that is enabled by default in the Caches pane of its Preferences. <comment260205> ahaah… ulimit -c == 0 will be the entire answer in my case, tyvm. <comment260314> Does `ulimit -c` do anything beyond the current shell process? On Linux it won't. <comment260325> @abligh You're kinda right. The man page says "A privileged user can also enable core files by using ulimit(1) or limit(1) depending upon the shell." I'll update my answer after I've tested this a bit. There seem to be a number of methods to change the limit. <comment260335> @AlistairMcMillan I am pretty sure it only effects processes which are descendants of the current shell. To enable core dumps globally, I believe you need to fiddle with `launchctl`. See https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/core.5.html <comment260349> @abligh You realise you're linking to a man page I just quoted from? :) <comment260351> @AlistairMcMillan ah! I thought that was the `ulimit` manpage. But I meant the line above re `launchctl`. <comment260473> @abligh Updated my answer. Hopefully it makes sense. <comment261185> What does `launchctl limit core` show for core size allowances? By default you should have nothing there with a soft limit of 0 size. Did you perhaps enable core dumps or can trace what specific files are being placed there? <comment297575> Helpful command to delete any older than 30 days: ```cd /cores; sudo find . -mtime +30 -type f -delete```
