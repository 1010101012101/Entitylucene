NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID in Chrome on OS X <body> I have a site with a Comodo EV SSL installed. When opening the site in Firefox or Safari, the site displays the green lock and the extended EV green bar. However, when opening the same site in chrome, I first get an error emNET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID/em and then when proceeding to the site it does not show me the green lock or the bar - it says that connection is not private (Chrome on a Windows PC has no problem - the green lock is showing, as is the EV green bar.  What is going on?
