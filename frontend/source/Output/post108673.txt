Why do I have a dozen copies of certain preference file in my ~/Library/Preferences folder? <body> I found the file code.Globalpreferences.plist/code in my code~/Library/Preferences/code folder, but I also found the same file with seven characters appended to the code.plist/code extension.  For example: code.GlobalPreferences.plist.jFulwSB/code. In total there are 30 code.Globalpreferences.plist/code files with appended characters.br I also found this behaviour with the codecom.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.plist/code file (192x), with the codewidget-com.apple.widget.stickies.plist/code file (106x) and the codewidget-com.apple.widget.weather.plist/code file (35x).  What are these files? Is it a backup? If so, what is backing them up?  <answer108678> Yes these are temporary file created by the NSUserDefault class when storing new preferences.   First, the temp file is created, then filled with the data and then the temp file replace the older one and gets deleted.   For some reason the were not deleted. You can check but I'm sure code.Globalpreferences.plist/code has a more recent modification date than code.GlobalPreferences.plist.jFulwSB/code. If it's in fact so, you can delete them.
