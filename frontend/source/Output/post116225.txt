How to export photos from a folder in iPhoto, preserving the album structures in the folder? <body> I have put several albums into a folder in iPhoto. Can I export the photos in this folder, so that the exported directory structure will be like  precodefolder/   album1/   album2/   ... /code/pre  Thank you.  <answer116227> Go to File &rarr; Export, select File Export and choose a Subfolder Format. This lets you select what you want the directory structure to be.  supSource: https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-4921/sup  <comment135975> I tried but only to see "None" and "Events". I want them organized by existing albums.
