How to find Time Machine disk image? <body> I try to compact Time Machine disk image but i can't find it. TM is in BackupDisk.  precode$ cd /Volumes $ ls -1 Macintosh HD MobileBackups BackupDisk $ sudo ls -l BackupDisk/ total 0 drwxrwxrwx@ 0 root wheel 0 Apr 24 11:17 Backups.backupdb /code/pre  I think result of this last command should end up with ".sparsebundle".  How i can find what i need to put to ??? in following code:  precodesudo su - root hdiutil compact /Volumes/???/???.sparsebundle /code/pre  <answer236046> Time Machine only uses a disk image when backing up to a network destination (OS X Server or Time Capsule). When backing up to a local volume (as you appear to be doing), it stores the backed-up files natively on the volume (inside the Backups.backupdb folder), with no disk image.  <comment288750> As a side remark: `sudo su - root` is kind of overkill, you can just use `sudo -s`.
