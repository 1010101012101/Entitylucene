Contacts can't be indexed by Launcbar: MacOS Error -67050 <body> on macos Sierra 10.12.4 and latest version of LaunchBar I have a problem with indexing Contacts items and now I am sure it is not LaucnBar's fault because I ran it in debug mode and found this in Console:  ul liUNIX error exception: 17 /li liMacOS Error -67050 /li /ul  There are bunch of other warnings (as always) which I believe are not relevant like:      warning: dynamic accessors failed to find @property implementation for   'uniqueId' for entity ABCDAddressBookSource while resolving selector   'uniqueId' on class 'ABCDAddressBookSource'.  Did you remember to   declare it @dynamic or @synthesized in the @implementation ?   Is there anybody else who had this problem with Contacts?  Thanks in advance  <comment353911> Are you running the most recent version of LaunchBar (compatible with Sierra)?  Have you contacted the developer of LaunchBar to verify it's not a bug in their application? <comment353959> All basic checks have been done before posting here. I even dig in logs and sampled processes in Activity Monitor with no clue. <comment353963> Were you able to ask the LaunchBar developer?  From my searching, the console errors you posted are either normal for Sierra or indicative of a [security access error](https://www.osstatus.com/search/results?platform=all&framework=all&search=-67050).  They might not have anything to do with your problem.
