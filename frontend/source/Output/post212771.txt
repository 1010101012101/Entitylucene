Boot from USB in macbook pro mid 2012 <body> I have removed everything from my macbook pro. Now, how can choose USB as a startup disk? I tried using codeoption/code    code"SHIFT"/code keys also codecmd+R/code. Nothing is working. How can I solve it? I am using Mid 2012 Macbook Pro and that usb is Ubuntu installer. [Btw, I am not interested to install Ubuntu in mac.]  <answer212772> Are you able to test if it boots from any other USB bootable source? To test if it's your mac or your Ubuntu installer that is the problem.  <answer212811> The 'option' key at startup will give you the option of selecting another startup disk. The problem may be that your USB stick is not considered a valid startup option.  <comment256913> how did you make your bootable ubuntu usb ?
