Homebrew, keg-only formulas: how to add LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS to build variables/how to symlink <body> Well, there are few days I'm trying to find the answer to this question. I'm not a super expert with informatics so I really don't know how to do this.  For example  precodebrew info flex /code/pre  I get  precodeflex: stable 2.6.0 (bottled) [keg-only] Fast Lexical Analyzer, generates Scanners (tokenizers) http://flex.sourceforge.net /usr/local/Cellar/flex/2.6.0 (44 files, 1.9M)   Poured from bottle From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/flex.rb ==&gt; Dependencies Required: gettext âœ” ==&gt; Caveats This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.  Some formulae require a newer version of flex.  Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your build variables:      LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/flex/lib     CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/flex/include /code/pre  What exactly I do to symlink flex?  <comment275982> You don't need to symlink anything for flex to work. The message says if you sym link this version, you will break other software. What package are you trying to install and link to this package?
