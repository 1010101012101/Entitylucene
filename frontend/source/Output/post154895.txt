Cannot boot into Windows after Yosemite Reinstall <body> When Yosemite went live to all users, I updated but a week later I wasn't happy with the performance of the mac and certain apps.  So I installed the OS from scratch, I made a backup, erased the Macintosh HD and reinstalled, all went right.  But I also have another partition with Windows 8.1 installed on the Mac. The first time that I tried to boot up from there I couldn't see the partition holding the option key on the startup so I made the startup disk from the option at Settings, but when I restarted onto Windows it said "no bootable device insert boot disk and press any key".br I've tried to repair the disk from disk utility, but all the options are greyed out and I can only change the name of the disk, I run a program called rEFIt and the result was this:    precode*** Report for internal hard disk ***   Current GPT partition table: #      Start LBA      End LBA  Type 1             40       409639  EFI System (FAT) 2         409640   1195166855  Mac OS X HFS+ 3     1196436392   1704248887  Mac OS X HFS+ 4     1708654592   1953521663  Basic Data  Current MBR partition table:  # A    Start LBA      End LBA  Type  1              1       409639  ee  EFI Protective  2         409640   1195166855  af  Mac OS X HFS+  3     1196436392   1704248887  af  Mac OS X HFS+  4     1708654592   1953521663  0c  FAT32 (LBA)  MBR contents:  Boot Code: Unknown, but bootable  Partition at LBA 40:  Boot Code: None (Non-system disk message)  File System: FAT32  Listed in GPT as partition 1, type EFI System (FAT)  Partition at LBA 409640:  Boot Code: None  File System: HFS Extended (HFS+)  Listed in GPT as partition 2, type Mac OS X HFS+  Listed in MBR as partition 2, type af  Mac OS X HFS+  Partition at LBA 1196436392:  Boot Code: None  File System: HFS Extended (HFS+)  Listed in GPT as partition 3, type Mac OS X HFS+  Listed in MBR as partition 3, type af  Mac OS X HFS+  Partition at LBA 1708654592:  Boot Code: Windows BOOTMGR (Vista)  File System: NTFS  Listed in GPT as partition 4, type Basic Data  Listed in MBR as partition 4, type 0c  FAT32 (LBA) /code/pre  If anyone could help me, I'd appreciate it :) Sorry for my English and thanks.  <comment182385> If it is util to someone, it doesn't allow me to use the software Camptune X, which doesn't detect Bootcamp enabled, and also the Bootcamp app doesn't allow me to create a new bootcamp partition or delete an existent windows disk, the option is greyed out, it seems like the Mac detects the partition in the hard drive, but it doesn't let me interact with it in anyway (even delete it)
