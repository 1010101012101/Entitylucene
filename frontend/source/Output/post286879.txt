iPhone 6S Flickering and Auto restarting <body> Two days ago, I run into an issue of my Mom's iPhone 6S turning off and on. I reset the iPhone after taking a backup and It ran fine for a day. Today, the issue propped up again and the device got stuck in a white screen. I did a hard reset with Home and Power Button combo, which restarted the iPhone with flickering screen and the phone is continously restarting.  Is this a software issue or a hardware issue? What should I do to fix it if there are any solutions.
