Go to the Running Safari And Press Enter Using AppleScript <body> I'm very new to AppleScript and I'm trying to do this. I have an Safari process running on my machine. I wish I could go to the running safari and stimulate an enter key event.   Is it possible to do so?   The code I'm trying is:  precodeon is_running(appName)     tell application "System Events" to (name of processes) contains appName end is_running  set safRunning to is_running("Safari") if safRunning then     run script "tell application \"Safari\"           key code 36     end tell"     return "Running" else     return "Not running" end if /code/pre  Inside the coderun script/code the codekey code 36/code (for stimulating enter) is giving me error:  precodeerror "Expected end of line but found identifier." number -2741 /code/pre  Any guesses where I'm making mistake?  <answer114502> The "System Events" must to the key pressing.  for example:  precodetell application "Safari"     activate     tell application "System Events" to key code 36 #return end tell /code/pre  I don't know, what the key pressing is for, so now has no effect.  A working example, where the download list is shown and then by pressing "space" the list is cleared:  precodetell application "Safari"     activate     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "l" using {command down, option down} # cmd-opt-l     delay 1     tell application "System Events" to key code 49 #space end tell /code/pre
