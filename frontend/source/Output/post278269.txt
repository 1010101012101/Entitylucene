How do you turn off AirPlay on ipad3?I'm trying to watch Netflix in my car but it just shows a tv box and says "you are now watching on your tv" <body> As stated I'm trying to watch Netflix in my car. Called Netflix they say to turn off AirPlay on my iPad. Can't find it anywhere on my iPad. Is there a way to do this? It's weird if I move the search button it shows were I am in the show.   <answer278271> To turn off airplay on iOS 10 you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and then swipe to the right. At the bottom of that view you'll see a triangle icon with circles, click that and change the source to iPad.  <comment350158> Can you clarify why the fact that you're in your car is relevant? Are you trying to play the audio over your speakers? Have you tried using Bluetooth? <comment350247> I'm riding thru Los Angeles and before I left home I downloaded some shows from Netflix to watch. When I try to watch them from my iPad it only shows a picture of a tv and says you are now watching on you tv. I'm in my car nowhere near a tv. Just checked my operating system and its not 10! Thanks JBallin I checked and yes my iPad can't download the new 10 because it doesn't support it. Any way of doing this without updating system? <comment350248> Thanks JBallin I checked and yes it doesn't show the new iOS 10.  my iPad 3 can't download the new 10 because it doesn't support it.

Additionally you may see a TV icon within Netflix itself, try clicking that and switching to iPad.
