Why is Safari messing up YouTube icons? <body> Some of the icons on YouTube are messed up in Safari, but the look fine in Chrome. If they are both WebKit browsers, why is this an issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dUyxY.png" alt="safari glitch"  <comment108262> Which Safari version do you have ? <comment108271> I have Safari 6.0.4 <comment108582> I could find several thumbs-up icons on youtube.com (which rendered properly in Safari 6.0.4), but I'm not able to locate that specific combination of text and icons in your question. Could you make a screenshot of a larger area?
