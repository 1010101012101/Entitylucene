Configuring a Mac to use Oxford spelling <body> I cannot figure out now to make my Mac (OS X 10.8) use Oxford spelling in its spell checker (note I am being absolutely precise in the use of that term)! For example, I want to be able to write "organize colours" without my Mac from underlining one of those words as a spelling error (whilst also recognising that the way I just spelled recognize was an error, as old habits die hard).  Neither the British nor American spelling options in the system preferences can do this, and it is just ever so slightly infuriating that a Mac that uses the Oxford Dictionary as its spelling dictionary will not use said dictionary's preferred spelling!  <comment119635> To add an additional spelling dictionary, copy the dictionary files (.aff and .dic) to the Spelling folder in your Library folder. <comment119656> You can also add dictionaries used by OpenOffice. This includes an OED. Install as per Buscar's comment. There are two sources for these:  http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries and   http://extensions.services.openoffice.org:80/en/dictionaries  What you download from the second source will have the extension .oxt. You need to change this to .zip, then double click on the file. The resulting folder should contain the .dic and .aff files. You can also try switching to Canadian or Australian english (for the spelling, not the accents). I'm not sure then about System Prefs. <comment119796> My Mac (OS X 10.8.5) prefers "colours" and underlines "colors", without me having added any dictionaries. However, I don't know which setting is responsible. If you or somebody else tells me where to look, I may report back. <comment240213> Related question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21429/uk-spelling-dictionary-teach-os-x-all-ize-spellings
