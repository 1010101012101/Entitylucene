How do I script Powerpoint to save a directory of PPTX files as PDFs? <body> If I have a directory of PPTX files I would like to save as PDFs.  How do I script this operation?  <answer49127> Assuming you have PowerPoint installed, this is quite simple using Automator.  (I have Office 2011, so I'm unsure if this would work with 2008)  Start Automator, and create a new Folder Action, and choose the input folder (i.e.: the one containing the PPTX files)  From the Actions list, choose "Convert Format of PowerPoint Presentations".  For the "New Format" option, choose "Portable Document Format".  Save it &amp; close Automator, and you're done!  Any PPTX files saved in the chosen folder (either pre-existing, or any new ones you save from now on) will automatically be converted to PDF as an additional copy.  Hope this helps!  -U  <comment56364> That pretty much worked.  I'm new to Automator so it took me a while to figure it out.  I had to save the Automator action as an Application and drop the PPTX files onto it.
