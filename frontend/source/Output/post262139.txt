Mac OS Server 5.2.x, Mobile Profiles, and Syncing <body> I have looked through Apple's website, and discussion forums already and not only have I come here with a headache after looking here too and not truly finding an answer.   I realized after searching that a solution has not honestly been forthcoming from Apple.  Originally I thought it was me, then I realized Apple removed the syncing ability of the user... to the server and visa versa.  I understand Apple did a poor job of doing it originally, and decided to remove it without notification. Now I am stuck finding a way to re-initiate the sync process when the user makes changes while on the network, or when they appear on the network after being home, or on the road.  I was thinking of using r-sync but I have no idea on how to even begin with it.  I am willing to learn, and work though it.   Is there anything that can be utilized that can duplicate behind the scenes the same processes that Apple removed?
