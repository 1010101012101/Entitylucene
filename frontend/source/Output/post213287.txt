Remnants from package installation <body> I'm on Yosemite 10.10.1  I was trying to install the Tor browser, but instead I mistakenly installed some general Tor proxy or something, which didn't come in the form of a normal application.  Basically I first installed MacPorts and then I codesudo port install tor/code which didn't give me the Tor browser, but some other Tor thing (I think it's something that allows you to use Tor proxy with any application, but I don't need that.)  So anyway, that command installed a bunch of components that I don't want or need on my system. How can I purge all these components from my system?  Here is the output from codesudo port install tor/code (I have ran codesudo port uninstall tor/code now, but I'm thinking some of the other stuff is still left behind.)  precodeFiksdals-iMac:~ Fiksdal$ sudo port install tor Error:  Error: No Xcode installation was found.

Fiksdals-iMac:~ Fiksdal$    /code/pre  Edit: I opened codeMacPorts.txt/code and found the following. Was this added during my installation of Tor?  libevent @2.0.22_1 (active)   openssl @1.0.2d_0 (active)   zlib @1.2.8_0 (active)   <comment257517> What makes you think that some files are left behind? <comment257518> Are you saying there probably aren't any? I mean, the installer seemed to install more than one thing, and when I uninstalled it was only Tor. <comment257521> Your log output only shows `tor`. <comment257522> Actually, this is from when I ran the same command again later, the first time I ran it there was a bunch of stuff happening.. This is kind of silly really. <comment257524> I added some more info to the question, this is what I am talking about. <comment257532> Please read the MacPorts Guide- `port deps tor` . You need to fix the problem with XCode before worrying about crud left after an uninstall.
