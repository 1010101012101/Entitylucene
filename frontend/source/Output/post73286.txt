Always open a file in a specific program <body> I'm having an issue with forcing a file of a certain type to always open with a specific program. In this case, it's code.indd/code (Adobe InDesign) files. I have Adobe CS6 installed, and also Adobe InDesign 5.5. I would like to always open code.indd/code files with InDesign 5.5.  I've tried using codeGet Info &gt; Open with: &gt; InDesign 5.5 &gt; Change All.../code but it keeps automatically switching back to CS6, immediately after clicking codeChange All.../code.  Is there perhaps a way I can force this in Terminal?  <answer73288> If you don't mind specifying InDesign 5.5 every time, then this command line should work:     codeopen -a 'InDesign 5.5' myfile.indd/code   If you're going to do this often, you can wrap it in a shell script or bash function like     codefunction indd() { open -a 'InDesign 5.5' "$@" ; }/code   Then you'll be able to simply say     codeindd myfile.indd/code   <answer73299> You could try editing code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist/code:  codedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentTag=indd;LSHandlerContentTagClass=public.filename-extension;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.adobe.InDesign;}'/code  Applying the changes requires restarting (logging out and back in isn't enough).  Rebuilding the LaunchServices database might also work, but it also resets other default applications set in Finder.  code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -domain local -domain system -domain user/code  <comment85147> This is quite good, though ideally it should be a little more user-friendly. Is there a way to intercept a double-click on an .indd file, and send that action to the first bash script? <comment85275> Although often there's no controlling Adobe, you might try changing permissions to user read/write in all relevant directories, with BatChmod or similar, and trying Change All again.
