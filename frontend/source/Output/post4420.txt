How to get a list of all songs in iTunes? <body> Is there an easy way to get a list of all my songs in iTunes into a text file?  <answer4421> This is actually insanely simple:  Open iTunes and go into your music library. Click on a song to ensure focus is inside the song list, press kbd⌘a/kbd to select all your songs, then press kbd⌘c/kbd to copy them.  Open the text editor of your choice, anything should do, then kbd⌘v/kbd paste your songs!  Ét Voíla, all your songs listed in plain text.  <answer4425> You already have one - albeit an XML file. Default place is ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml  <answer4441> You can get a nice pdf with the content of your music library: hit code⌘P/code to open the print dialog, select "Album list" (I'm using a not english version of iTunes, son I'm not fully sure of the label, I mean the third radiobox from the top) and the "Only text" theme (the first option on the select field). Click "Print..." and then Save as PDF.  The resulting document is really nice: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xSnum.png" alt="alt text"  <comment4238> Thanks, I thought I was probably going to have to use Apple Script or something <comment4245> You could also unshow comments to get just the details you want <comment4247> By comments, you meant "columns", I assume? <comment4265> You are correct <comment4266> That's a really really good point. Visible columns copied, so arrange the columns as you want to see them in text representation. Nice. Thanks. <comment4267> For reference, in English, Davide is saying to go into your library, hit ⌘p, choose 'Album Listing' (the last radio button option), the theme name will change to 'Songs by album', leave that if you prefer the look of the above screenshot. Then use the PDF button on the bottom left to save as a PDF, or of course you can print it normally. It will look like the above, which is very slick. <comment4296> Thanks for completing my answer with the proper English reference!
