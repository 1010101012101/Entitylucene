Keeping Firefox's places.sqlite file from consuming too much space in Time Machine bakckups <body> My Time Machine backups often consist of Firefox's places.sqlite file (which, as I understand it, contains both history and bookmarks) and little else. When I clear my browsing history the file shrinks by about 80%. I think I have the following options:  ol liLive with it/li liExclude places.sqlite from being backed up and risk losing my bookmarks/li liTell Firefox not to track history/li /ol  Is there another option under which I track history without burning space to back it up?  BTW, running sqlite vacuum helps some, shrinking places.sqlite by about a factor of two. The command is codesqlite3 places.sqlite "vacuum;"/code.  <answer117825> Yes.  Set Firefox to auto-export your bookmarks on close to bookmarks.html in your profile and then exclude places.sqlite from being backed up.
