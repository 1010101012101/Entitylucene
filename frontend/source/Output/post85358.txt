MacBook Pro won't connect to wireless internet, though it says it already is! <body> I am suddenly having problems with my MacBook Pro's wireless connectivity.  It has worked flawlessly up to this point: I choose a wireless network from the list, I type the password, and it just works.  Now, all of a sudden, I am not able to connect to any wireless network.  My computer tells me I am connected to the wireless internet network I chose, though the Network window says that the airport is not connected.  No webpages will load, and I cannot access the iTunes store.  I have tried to follow some simple problem solving after doing some research, but I am having no luck.  I am somewhat computer illiterate and I really need my internet to work.  I haven't changed anything, so I am at a loss as to why it would fail suddenly with no warning.  HELP!  <comment98367> Does the network window say you aren't connected to a *network*, or the *internet*? (Is the dot red or yellow?) There is a significant difference between the two. <comment98374> There is a red dot next to AirPort, and it says "not connected" <comment98375> It says Status: On, but also says "Airport does not have an IP address and cannot connect to the Internet" <comment98381> That means it *is* connected to the network, but for whatever reason, it did not receive an IP address. Because of that, you could probably access something connected to the same network, but nothing through the internet. Other than the most basic troubleshooting (restart the router, turn WiFi off and on, restart your computer), I really can't provide any help though. Sorry. <comment98385> Does it work on another person's wireless network, or does this issue persist on any network? <comment98457> It would not connect when I got home.  We have a separate wireless network there, obviously, and the same problem occurred.  Apparently I am not able to connect to any network :( <comment98544> Try following all the steps here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4628
