All calendars keep getting marked as visible <body> Every time I open iCal, all my calendars are marked as visible. I only use two of those calendars on a regular basis (the other ten are shared, special use calendars), so I uncheck all the ones I don't want cluttering my view. Then, the next time I open iCal, all the calendars are visible again. So I uncheck again. Grr, frustrating.  Any ideas on how to set calendars invisible by default?
