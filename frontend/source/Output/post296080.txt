Installed GitHub multiple times <body> I am new to macOS. By mistake I installed GitHub multiple times because I could not find in the Applications folder. Later I realized my mistake and opened that through terminal.  Before realizing I installed it four time which I came to know through system preference. So I want to know that if I really installed it four times or every other time the previous app was replaced. If I installed it four times then how to remove that to free space.  <comment373908> What exactly did you install - if it is a GUI app then it should be in /Applications <comment373928> You can install git (e.g. with brew) or a GitHub Client GUI (like GitHub Desktop). Apple Xcode also provides git. So it's unclear what you've installed previously. Please add some details. <comment373929> I installed 2.14.1 of Git for the Mac platform. <comment373930> Git and github are two different things  - which one did you install. what link did you install from? <comment373931> https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.14.1-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download?use_mirror=autoselect   This is the link <comment373993> Well that is not an official link - Either get git as part of Xcode or fromn git itself https://git-scm.com/downloads - I think you need to read up a bit more on what got and github are as you seem to be doing and saying a lot of incorrect things here. <comment374092> I tried to download from the link you gave however it was not responsing so on the same page I found the link I gave. Now my query is only that if I installed Git multiple times then does that meant I have four separate installation on Mac or is it one only.
