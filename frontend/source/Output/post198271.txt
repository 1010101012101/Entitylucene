Formatting of a web page messed up when using proxy <body> strongemBackground/em/strong  For academic purposes I have to use an emuniversity proxy/em from my home in order to access some contents online available only with this method (PUBMED, a medical research database).  I have configured Firefox to connect through this proxy as explained in my faculty website.   strongemThe problem/em/strong  However when accessing PUBMED I notice the proxy is working properly regarding the contents, meaning I can access contents usually unavailable without the proxy, but at the same time there are emerrors in how the page is formatted/em.  Everything happens to be in column in the left side of the screen.  I tried to disable all addons I had, but did not work.  <comment237215> I presume it all works correctly when using Firefox on campus? Do you need to go through a VPN first? (I know I did for my uni) <comment237220> Yes, it works correctly when using Firefox on campus. No I just need to configure how FF connects to the web by "automatic configuration": http://proxy.cad.univpm.it/proxy.pac
