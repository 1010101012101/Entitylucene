VLC udp stream stops after any interrupt or track change in lan in mac os <body> I am trying to stream audio in lan network in mac os sierra with vlc version 2.2.5.1 Umbrella.  I am able to stream my playlist .xspf file. But it stops after one song finish or track change and need to reconnect again in client machine (receiver). I am using default vlc wizard to stream setup.  I tried sout keep , sout all and gather. Also i tried to encode all songs in same format by selecting trancode audio.But nothing worked for me.Perhaps i am trying commands in wrong order.It works fine for windows 7 os.Please guide me in this what's going wrong?  Below are MRL generating by vlc wizard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qPlOM.png" alt="enter image description here"  here is what i am receving log in receiver machine,  precode /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/share/lua/meta/art core debug: no art finder modules matched core debug: art not found for aa macosx debug: releasing old sleep blocker (34696) macosx debug: prevented sleep through IOKit (34702) ts debug: PMTCallBack called ts debug: new PMT program number=1 version=2 pid_pcr=68 ts debug:   * es pid=68 type=3 dr-&gt;i_tag=0xa ts debug: found language:  ts debug:   * es pid=68 type=3 fcc=mpga ts warning: discontinuity received 0x0 instead of 0x9 (pid=68) core warning: clock gap, unexpected stream discontinuity core warning: feeding synchro with a new reference point trying to recover from clock gap core debug: discarded audio buffer mpeg_audio debug: emulated startcode (no startcode on following frame) core debug: discarded audio buffer core debug: discarded audio buffer core debug: discarded audio buffer core debug: discarded audio buffer core debug: discarded audio buffer core debug: discarded audio buffer core debug: discarded audio buffer core debug: discarded audio buffer core debug: discarded audio buffer core warning: clock gap, unexpected stream discontinuity core warning: feeding synchro with a new reference point trying to recover from clock gap clock error: Timestamp conversion failed (delay 1000000, buffering 0, bound 3000000) core error: Could not convert timestamp 55337150977 core debug: discarded audio buffer clock error: Timestamp conversion failed (delay 1000000, buffering 0, bound 3000000) core error: Could not convert timestamp 55337177099 core debug: discarded audio buffer clock error: Timestamp conversion failed (delay 1000000, buffering 0, bound 3000000) core error: Could not convert timestamp 55337203222 core debug: discarded audio buffer clock error: Timestamp conversion failed (delay 1000000, buffering 0, bound 3000000) core error: Could not convert timestamp 55337229344 core debug: discarded audio buffer clock error: Timestamp conversion failed (delay 1000000, buffering 0, bound 3000000) core error: Could not convert timestamp 55337255466 core debug: discarded audio buffer /code/pre
