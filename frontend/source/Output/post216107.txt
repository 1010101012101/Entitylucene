Create a new Apple ID with the same email <body> Due to certain reasons and circumstances, I want to create a new AppleID  account (lets call it strongID2/strong) using my personal primary email (strongE1/strong), already used in an existing AppleID (strongID1/strong). In the end, if everything succeeds, I won't need strongID1/strong any more. It's truly important to use E1 and not create a new email.  Could you please help me with some of your experience and detailed walk-through how to do it right? Thanks in advance!  <comment261109> I'll try to link to some of the questions that cover this. Basically - it depends, I would work with Apple to understand the ramifications of this... If you read the linked posts, you can get a feeling for the misery people brought upon themselves trying to change Apple ID without being aware of how things work. <comment261110> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/117426/if-i-delete-1-apple-id-email-address-will-the-same-email-addy-become-available <comment261111> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/142069/ <comment261112> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/213693/ <comment261113> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/62468/ <comment261114> That last link is the one. Cannot be done, as you cannot dissociate E1 from ID1 <comment261115> late pseudo-random gripe. One day Apple may let us merge IDs, especially for those of us who had iTunes accounts ***years*** before even me.com existed /lateâ€¦yada yada <comment261126> @Tetsujin yes, that's it... dead end( <comment261127> You could set up a totally different ID, then use [Family Sharing](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201060) to allow one access to parts of the other. Best I can think of.
