How can I set the region in Terminal <body> I want to change the Region via Terminal. How can I do this ?  Ideally it would use a command (/usr/bin or sbin) or modify a plist (plistbuddy).  I'd love to avoid using osascript (AppleScript) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qVjTX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer196770> The region is stored in code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences/code, as the second part of the strongAppleLocale/strong variable.  Some examples of the AppleLocale variable:  ul listrongen_US/strong emsystem language set to English, region set to US/em/li listrongja_JP/strong emsystem language set to Japanese, region set to Japan/em/li listrongen_DE/strong emsystem language set to English, region set to Germany/em/li /ul  You can get more info from Apple's Developer Library, which also has links to the ISO 639-2 codes that can be used.
