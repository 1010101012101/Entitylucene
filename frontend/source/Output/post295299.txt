Bluetooth headset deselected from Control Center, but is automatically selected again <body> I recently switched from an Android to an iPhone (7) and haven't got used to it yet. I daily use a Bluetooth headset (Sony SBH80) and sporadically, my iPhone starts to route all audio to it.   Here's what I do: When I'm done using the headset, I open the Control Center and select iPhone (instead of SBH80) from the airplay-looking drop-down-menu. After a while when wanting to watch something with sound, the sound is routed to the Headset again and SBH80 is once again selected in the airplay-looking drop-down-menu. This happens several times a day and it's really annoying.   I have googled it, and some people are suggesting to remove the pairing with the Bluetooth device, which is not at all what I want to do - I connect to and use it daily, just not all the time.  It seems possible to go in to the bluetooth settings and disconnect the headset, but thats just way too complicated to do every time I want to drop the headset.   Is this the expected behaviour, and if so, what can I do while still being able to connect the headset easily?  Thanks!  Note: I have a theory that this might be occurring when I enter the Bluetooth proximity of the headset after being too far away from it. This would be totally OK if it just connected to it, while leaving the audio route on the iPhone speakers.
