Why settings app goes mad? <body> I have brought new iPhone a week back and have found few problems. One of which is when I search for any settings under settings page then the app goes mad and is overlap with the time bar above the phone. See below image.  Problem 2. Sometimes I don't see search bar and the setting page is just hang.  Will the apple be able to help me? I know for a year apple provides free support.
