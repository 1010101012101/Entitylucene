5.1 audio from DP connected display <body> I have MacBook Air (Mid 2011) with Dell U2713H (with two 1.2 DPs and HDMI) connected with DisplayPort and Creative Labs 5300 Inspire 5.1 speakers.  I would like to know whether or not can I get 5.1 channel audio without obtaining a USB sound card. Speakers have only analog inputs (3 jacks).  The MB is capable of outputting 5.1 through both DP and HDMI (with a DP → HDMI adapter). The display shows up as an audio output device in macOS. I wonder whether can I use display’s second DP (it mirrors input from the first DP) and extract 5.1 analog audio.  It seems like there are HDMI audio extractors which could be used for this purpose.  hr  As I am composing this question I have come across many HDMI audio extractors while not finding any DisplayPort device for the same purpose. These devices are coming out rather expensive when compared with a USB sound card and this observation seems to be making this question rather academic.  Still I am posting it as I would like to know if anybody actually made such a connection work and perhaps as a guide for anybody contemplating similar problem.
