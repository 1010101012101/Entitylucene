How do you find the UDID for an iOS device? <body> How do you find the UDID for an iOS device on Mac and Windows?  <answer1175> You can follow the official how-to from Apple KB.  The same way works for iPhone, iPod and iPad.  The easiest way is to plug your iDevice, open iTunes, click on your device on the left panel of iTunes then click on the serial number. Your UDID will appear :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CB7Qz.png" alt="udid"  <answer15663> An alternative for those who don't actually run iTunes (yes there are alternatives) is to open the codeSystem Profiler/code, access the codeUSB section/code, find the iPhone on the list of connected devices under the USB device tree.  On the iPhone listing there will be an entry that says codeserial number/code. This is not to be confused with the serial number listed in the General - About section of the iPhone settings. The serial in the System Profiler is equivalent to the UDID.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TsjlB.png" alt="System Report from System Information"  Note that on Lion, System Profiler has been renamed System Information and you can get the the USB information from the hardware portion of the System Report.  <answer16154> While all the methods described so far require the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad to be connected to a computer, there are a large number of free applications available in the App Store to find the UDID without needing to do this (and, thus, effectively working on Mac, Windows, and indeed anything else).  The one I use and generally recommend to remote clients is Erica Sadun's Ad Hoc Helper (screenshot, etc., at below link):  http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ad-hoc-helper/id285691333?mt=8  Which extracts the UDID and places it in an e-mail ready to be sent to whoever needs it, but a quick search of the iTunes store for "UDID" reveals half a dozen or so apps all intended to do this and any of which would do the job.  <comment995> Please provide screen shots as I'd like to share this with *very* non-technical people. <comment62750> That's a priceless answer, as it was the only way to get the UDID of my phone after I upgraded to a beta version and forgot to add the UDID to the provisioning portal!!! <comment62810> It's worth noting that Apple is trying to get iOS developers to move away from accessing/using the UDID for privacy reasons and as of [March 2012](http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/24/apple-udids/) is actively rejecting apps that do so. <comment91899> In iTunes 11, the method is the same, just the layout of the Summary pane is a bit different.
