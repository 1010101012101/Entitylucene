Is there a way to force a password check on a Macbook using Touch ID <body> I like to be able to use Touch ID for quickly unlocking my Macbook, e.g. for when I've walked away from the machine for a few minutes but it's still in a safe place.  But I'd also like to be able to lock it properly, with a password, for when I'm taking it out of the office or otherwise want to enforce more security.  By default you need to enter your password after a system restart, or if you get 5 failed fingerprints in a row, or after no login for 48 hours.  Is there a command-line command, or a programmatic way to replicate this state, so I could script it using one of the various automation tools out there?  <answer282630> You're looking for the command line tool codebioutil/code.  Probably with the -u option.  precodeUsage: bioutil {-r | -w [-f { 0 | 1 }] [-u { 0 | 1 }] [-a { 0 | 1 }]} | [-c] | [-p] | [-d &lt;uid&gt;] [-s]   Options:     -r, --read                      Read current Touch ID settings     -w, --write                     Write new Touch ID settings     -s, --system                    Flag to read/write systemwide Touch ID settings or perform systemwide operations     -f, --function                  Enable (1) or disable (0) Touch ID functionality in general (system settings only)     -u, --unlock $value             Enable (1) or disable (0) Touch ID for unlock     -a, --applepay $value           Enable (1) or disable (0) Touch ID for ApplePay (user settings only)     -c, --count                     Print number of enrolled fingerprints of the current user or of all users (-s, administrator only)     -p, --purge                     Delete all enrolled fingerprints of the current user or of all users (-s, administrator only)     -d, --delete $uid               Delete all enrolled fingerprints of the given user (administrator only) /code/pre  <comment344438> try just typing the password to login.  Even if you don't see the text input field it should work.  If it does, I'll format this as a proper answer. i.e. open the MacBook and just type the password to unlock. <comment344439> @bjbk OP is asking about *forcing* password entry, preventing the use of Touch ID. <comment344441> I see now.  So to 'toggle' the TouchID settings on/off with a shortcut then? <comment344455> yeah, sorry if I wasn't clear - basically toggle off TouchID when I want to leave a secure area. <comment345523> It's kind of clunky, but could you just use the wrong finger 5 times upon wake, then close it up to carry out of the office? <comment345623> yeah, that would work, as a short term workaround. Thanks! <comment356774> Hmm - this works, but with a couple of issues:  If I run `bioutil -w -u 0` and then `bioutil -w -u 1` it does what I want - it forces password entry *once* and then accepts fingerprints again.  However, it also always prompts for the user password. Even if run as root/sudo.  So hard to script.  If I run `bioutil -w -s -u 0` as root or admin, it works without a user password - but disabling unlock globally also *forgets* all enrolled fingerprints, so again not very useful.  Thanks, though, this is the closest I've seen to what I want.
