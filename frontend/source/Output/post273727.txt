Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard not recognized as a proper keyboard <body> When connecting to a new Macbook Pro 2016, running Sierra v10.12.3, it doesn't ask me to type the 6 digits to pair it properly. It also shows up in the bluetooth list with the bluetooth icon, rather than a keyboard icon like other keyboards. And in keyboard settings, I am unable to adjust the modifier keys, as I can with other keyboards.   Any ideas how to fix this?  <answer273837> strongIt appears that the keyboard is not compatible with macOS./strong  The Surface Ergonomic Keyboard doesn't list compatibility with any OS other than Windows 10 and specifically, the Surface line of products.  Basically, there is no macOS driver for this particular keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mCrHh.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is unlike their more generic Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard which specifically lists alternate OSes including macOS and Android (though with limited functionality).  <answer275219> I use my surface ergonomic keyboard with macOS.  The only thing I found tricky was that you need to hit the enter key after typing in the code.  <answer293596> macOS Sierra does not fully recognize the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard as a keyboard, but a workaround exists.  ol liInstall Karabiner Elements. It lets you intercept and remap keyboard input./li liLaunch Karabiner Elements and go to the Devices tab and uncheck everything but "Ergonomic Keyboard" so that Karabiner does not swap keys with any other keyboards attached to your computer. /li liSwitch to the "Simple Modifications Keys" tab. Click the "add item" button. Remap "left_command" to "left_option" and "left_option" to "left_command". Then do the same for "right" command/option keys./li /ol  <comment344124> Sorry, good point, updated. <comment344129> @TravisR, please Option-click the bluetooth icon in your menu bar, it should provide more detail about the keyboard and how it is being registered by the Mac which could be helpful when figuring out the problem (feel free to omit the actual BT address as this is unneccesary info). Another point, does the keyboard have a USB A/micro port on it (perhaps for charging)? If it does and the port can also read data it may be causing the keyboard to be recognized as a data transfer device rather than a keyboard. Finally when you connected it did you get a "This keyboard is unrecognized" dialogue? <comment370457> But aren't Macs with ≥ macOS Mavericks ["Bluetooth® Smart Ready Device\[s\] with HID support"?](https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2013/06/12/apple-ios-and-os-x-updates-put-bluetoothsmart-ready-at-the-center-of-appcessory-connectivity) <comment370479> @JariKeinänen - your Mac *must* have Bluetooth 4.0 capability to take advantage of the Smart Ready tech.  It's just *available and implemented* in macOS Mavericks and newer.
