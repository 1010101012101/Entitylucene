Episode description not showing in iTunes or on the Apple TV <body> I have added descriptions to my episodes using Subler and for some reason neither iTunes or the Apple TV shows it correctly.  iTunes shows it in the episode list but not on the info page. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fzDu0.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Apple TV doesn't show it all. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XPEkH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This is what it looks like in Subler img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKyZo.png" alt="enter image description here"  I guess this is because of the 255 character limit that iTunes have for the "short" description but if I copy the text from Subler into the description editor in iTunes for the episode and hit codeOK/code, it works as it should since iTunes then takes the description and truncates it to 255 characters.  Can I somehow automate this process for multiple files?
