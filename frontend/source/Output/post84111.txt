How can I stop the iPhone from buzzing when it is ringing? <body> I finally found a nice ringtone for my iPhone but can barely hear it because the phone buzzes while ringing. How can I switch of the buzzing?  <answer84115> settings - sounds - and vibrate on ring to off!  <comment96770> +1 ... that's if you mean vibrating when you say "buzzing".  The other possibility is that your new ringtone somehow got buzzing included in it. <comment96930> I guess that is it.
