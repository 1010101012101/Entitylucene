Is it possible on an iPad to turn off the prompt to sign in to iTunes? <body> I am not very familiar with Apple products, but we use iPads for Point of Sale cash registers at my work.   They keep interrupting us in the middle of orders prompting us to sign in to iTunes. It's very frustrating, I am wondering if it is possible for us to turn off this prompt?  We do not use iTunes and only use the iPads for our Point of Sale software. Any advice?  I am brand new to Apple products and do not have much knowledge of them at all.  <comment336003> Thank you for your question! To help us answer the question, please give us more information about the problem. For example, which iPads are you using? Which operating system version are they on? What is the name of the point of sale software you are using? <comment336058> It's not clear from your question as to whether you're entering the password and then keep getting prompted? Or do you **not** answer the password? If not, is it because you don't know/recall what it is? Also, is the prompt quoting your Apple ID in the message, or your iCloud account instead?
