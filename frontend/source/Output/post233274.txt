Automator service not showing in services menu <body> I know next to nothing about the OS X, but I've been asked to make a few different scripts for actions in Apple Mail.  One is to bind a hotkey that will create a reminder with a followup time of two business days.    I followed a guide on how to build the script and insert it into Automator found here.  The script works when running in the AppleScript application, and compiles and runs in Automator.  The service/workflow generated by Automator is saved to ~/Library/Services/ but does not show in the services menu in Apple Mail.  This article says that services for Apple Mail should be in the /System/Library/Automator folder.  I am unable to move the service to that folder as the folder is locked.  The service is set to have no input, and be in the mail application.    How can I get this workflow/service to show in the mac mail services menu?  <answer234980> So, apparently, I had to disable rootless system integrity protection just to move the workflow file between folders.  I still hope someone finds a better way of installing services in the mail app in El Capitan, because having to do multiple reboots and disabling low level security features seems excessive when I'm just trying to pull data from two basic apps.    http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/
