Trouble accessing the OS X Lion web server from other device <body> I'm developing a web app for mobile phones. To easily get a feel of how it is to use, I simply copied the app into code~/Sites/code (after enabling web sharing in the codeSystem Preferences/code).  Navigating to codehttp://localhost/~username/myapp.html/code works perfectly. But if I do an codeifconfig/code to get my IP address and navigate to the URL from my iPhone (substituting localhost with the IP address), I get an codeError 404/code. How can I troubleshoot and resolve this issue?  <answer102030> If you put it in the   ~/Sites  Folder then you have to navigate to  192.168.0.1/~USERNAME  Where you substitute your IP address and the username that belongs to the ~/Sites folder you copied your web app to.  To get it to just recognize the IP address without the username subfolder put it here:  /Library/Webserver/Documents  EG emNOT/em the library folder in your home folder but the library folder in the root of the hard drive.
