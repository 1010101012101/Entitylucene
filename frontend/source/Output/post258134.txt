Change Apple ID for installed apps without losing data? <body> Company tech guy installed Good Work into iphone6+ before given to me.  now phone prompts update for Good Work.  But I have been installing other apps into the phone using my own personal apple id. can I delete the originally installed Good Work app, and re-install it back using my own id without losing my mails and settings? thanks  <comment322604> In short, no. Get the tech guy to update it with his own account ID if you want to keep existing data. <comment322607> I see, thanks. even if I am willing to start over again using my own apple id, I still will not be able to setup again using my old activation key, right? I will need to re-apply for a new key for the newly installed app? <comment322608> If you wipe it & re-purchase under your own ID, then you'll start afresh with any data that app stores locally rather than in the cloud; but you will now own it. [I have no idea what the app is or how its data is stored, which makes the 'keep/lose' data issue impossible for me to be categorical on.]
