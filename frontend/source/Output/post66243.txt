Cannot assign 'Open With' to a specific application using Mountain Lion <body> I am using Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and Coda 2.0.4.  I want all my .js files to open with Coda (currently js files are assigned to Safari).  When I do a 'Get Info' and change the 'Open with' application I try to select Coda 2 but it immediately bounces back to Safari.  If I choose any other application, like Firefox, XCode, etc it takes it. It only seems to hate Coda 2.  Any idea what's the issue?  <answer66249> Have you tried rebuilding the Launch Services database by running code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -seed/code?  If that doesn't work, you could also try codedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=com.netscape.javascript-source;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.panic.Coda;}'/code. Applying the changes requires restarting (logging out and back in isn't enough).  <comment77928> Lauri the first method returns a non-existing folder message. The 2nd method did run but after restart I still have the same problem. how frustrating... <comment77959> I edited the first command. The path changed in some version of OS X, but I copied the older one.
