Using a MacBook air as a monitor <body> Can I use the MacBook Air as a monitor when making a video with my Iphone. I wish to use my camera app on my Iphone 5s to record  how to videos and need to be able to see on a monitor at the same time. Is this possible  <answer227476> Yep,   ol liPlug your iPhone into your MacBook via Lightning-to-USB cable./li liOpen QuickTime Player (it's on every Mac)/li liWhile QuickTime Player is running, click File in the menu bar./li liSelect "New Movie Recording" (not "New Screen Recording" like one may think)/li liClick the arrow on the right of the record button to open a dropdown/li liSelect your iPhone under the camera section/li liIf you want sound as well, repeat 5 &amp; 6, but select your iPhone under "Microphone", as well/li /ol  That's it! Your iPhone will have to be within USB cable length of your Mac, but you will be able to see everything on it that you will be able to see on your iPhone, and it's 100% free.  Note: mirroring the screen of your iPhone on your Mac will drain the battery life substantially
