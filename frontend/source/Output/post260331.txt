Browsers crash whenever I try to upload files online <body> Recently, all my browsers (Safari &amp; Google Chrome) on macOS Sierra started crashing whenever I upload files to StackExchange, Facebook, etc. That is, let's say I want to upload a file on math.se. But when I click the "browse for image", as soon as Finder opens, both the browser and Finder stops working.  The system becomes very slow sometimes and sometimes, the trackpad won't work as well. I will upload two videos using Google Drive from my mobile now.   System specs: MacBook Pro 2015, 256 GB SSD (128 GB for Windows because I need AutoCAD, SolidWorks,etc)  Videos of crash: Video 1, Video 2  Sorry for the bad quality of videos.  strongEDIT:/strong   System report during the time of new crash. I did it as @klanomath told me to.

That's the most massive thing you can do. First I would create and log in as a new (admin) user and check if the same happens there also. Then verify/repair disk/volume <comment325895> @klanomath how will i do that? <comment325896> Browsers: safari, chrome, torch. <comment325897> Try to upload something and when the browser/Finder crash note down the time of day. Then you probably have to reboot (to get a more responsive Finder/system). Open Console.app and check system.log for suspicious entries at that time. <comment325901> Its got a thousand lines. I dont understand them <comment325903> @klanomath the hang reports for chrome and torch are there. But how will I show them to you? <comment325906> You may also add the Google Chrome's hang report: /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Google Chrome_2016-11-08-160642_Ns-MacBook-Pro.hang. Please upload it to Google drive or pastebin and add a link here.
