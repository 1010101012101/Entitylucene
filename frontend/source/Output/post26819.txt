Enter a filename in the File Open dialog <body> Can I enter a path to a file and its name instead of selecting a file in Mac OS X file dialog?  I tried just typing into an open dialog but it will just try to "Go to a folder", it won't accept a full path.  I'm on Mac OS X Lion  <answer26820> Yes. When the Finder dialog box is active type kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdG/kbd to bring up the codeGo to the folder/code direct entry dialog. You can enter the path to the file in the dialog using the Unix-type path expressions you'd expect: code~/code for your home directory, code//code for a directory separator, etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6pbPX.png" alt="The Go To File dialog box"  <answer26825> Since it looks like you're just trying to open a hidden file, in the open dialog press kbdcommand/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd./kbd and the hidden files will appear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aRApS.png" alt="Open dialog"  <answer191108> The really nice thing about the "Go to folder" dialog is that auto-completion works - type the first couple of characters in the name, then TAB, and it fills in the rest of the characters.  If you get an error instead (say, you forgot one directory name in the path) you can correct it immediately instead of having to find the mistake at the end.  The only significant limitation is that you have to type an absolute path, starting at either your home directory or the file system root.  There's no concept of a current directory, as in bash.  <comment30597> hi. It's 'go to the folder', and it won't work for files (I'm trying on `~/.profile`) <comment30603> thank you. but actually, I'm just looking for a way to minimize my mouse usage. and I hate selecting files like that <comment30604> Once the hidden files are visible, you can type the filename and it will be selected. Alternatively, I suggest a third-party app like LaunchBar. <comment30605> Once the hidden files are visible, you should be able to type-to-select. <comment30607> wow, that worked! any chance to have hidden files shown by default? and maybe a tab-completion on the filepath? <comment30608> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5870/how-to-show-hidden-files-and-folders-in-finder for showing hidden files by default. <comment30613> You can also press "/" or "~" to enter the "Go to the folder:" drop-down, starting the path with "/" or "~" respectively. <comment30620> @valya that sucks. I didn't realize it wouldn't let you enter the exact file in the dialog (I don't use it very often myself). Hopefully someone has a better answer. <comment30621> I'll second LaunchBar. I use that to get to *everything* on my Mac. <comment30623> Ian, but can I use it to replace the "Open File" dialog in applications? I want to open random files smoothly from Sublime Text <comment30624> no, sorry, Ian, you actually were right - take a look at comments to the different answer <comment30699> @valya it won't replace the open dialog, but you can use it to send files to Sublime Text. When I want to open a file I hit Cmd-Space to bring up LaunchPad, find the file and hit TAB and then I send it to the program and there it is. It's awesome. <comment108464> Well that's interesting, but id doesn't actually answer the question as given... <comment211956> This does not answer the question at all. <comment328294> Cmd+V not working on "Go to the folder" when copy from webstorm.. grr <comment342400> Cmd+V is not working. But, right click - Paste is working.
