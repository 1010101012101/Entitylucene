In iMessage, can I search an individual's messages? <body> I have a 5-year conversation going on with my wife on iMessage.  Every once in a while I want to find something like a restaurant she messaged me about.  I want to search for the word "restaurant" and find ALL the times she used that word, meaning only within HER messages.  How can I do that?  I know about the universal iMessage search, but that's not what I'm after. It shows me only 1 instance of the word "restaurant," not all of them.  <comment345082> I wish....  I've sent that suggestion to http://www.apple.com/feedback before, you should also.
