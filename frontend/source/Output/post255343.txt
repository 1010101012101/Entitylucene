Application closing automatically OSX 10.11.6 <body> I have a weird situation, applications on mac keep closing by themselves. Especially chrome and safari! I have checked if there is any weird program executing but I haven't found any. Did this happen to anyone else?  <comment318040> Any chance a cat is wandering over your keyboard and pressing Cmd-Q? Wouldn't hurt to run a scan with [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) just to make sure you don't have anything untoward present. <comment320305> I'm pretty sure no cat is doing anything. I have tried Malwarebytes and no suspicious thing was found.
