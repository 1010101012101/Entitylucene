any tools for developers for editing screen shots of web pages? <body> I am not a photoshop expert neither want to become one.   I want to show to client the next version of changes in the current web page for example   consider current  google page, in the next version a new check box and new drop down list will be added.  How about me taking the screen shot of the current page, and adding the check box, and new drop down list (drag and drop)  is there is any tool which does my imaginative way for editing screen shots ?  <comment257351> You may attract better answers over at the [Graphic Design Stack Exchange](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com). <comment257352> @GrahamMiln thank you , heard for the first time about this site
