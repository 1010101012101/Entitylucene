iPhone Taskbar close all applications <body> Is there a way to close all application in the taskbar at once?  <answer45> h3No./h3  You have to manually remove each one.  <answer61661> One nifty trick I learned from a friend: Enter "wiggle" mode for the taskbar, then tap the icons strongfrom right to left/strong. This way you can close at least four apps in a steady motion without having to wait for the icons move one column to the right. Sounds obvious, but try it out and youâ€™ll see what I mean.
