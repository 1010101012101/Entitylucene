How to make the Google search app open Youtube links on the Youtube app? <body> On iPhone (iOS 8.1.3) If I run a search on the Google search app (the one with the Google Now integration) for something like a song, some of the results would be, of course, Youtube videos.   If I click on one of those videos, the internal browser will open the Youtube mobile site. I want to open it with the Youtube app.  I tried tap+hold on the link on the results page but the only options are Open, Add to Reading List and Copy.  So, is there any configuration I'm missing to tell the search app to send those links to the Youtube app?   Thanks!
