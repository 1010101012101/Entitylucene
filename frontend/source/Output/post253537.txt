right mouse click and hold on remote desktop program not working <body> when i tried to access my desktop and play some game through either Team Viewer/chrome remote desktop, i,e world of Warcraft. the right click + hold usually for rotating the camera, but this doesn't work during entire remote control.. it will just mega spin at one direction. any suggestion to fix it?   <comment315485> You need to be able to disable 'mouse warp to centre' on whichever game you're running... & no, idk if every game has that option.
