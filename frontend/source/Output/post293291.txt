/private folder taking up too much space, is there a way to disable this from happening? <body> I am using a mac VM and have zabbix monitoring on it. The VM has to stay on indefinitely and the private folder eventually gets so large the disk space goes to nothing. I know /private/var/folder can be manually deleted, but is there an option or setting to stop this from occurring in the first place? I do not want to go and delete it every so often for every VM.  Edit: It seems to be /private/var/folders/c8/com.apple.DeveloperTools and then some Xcode files that are over 5 GB  <comment370047> First try assigning more disk space to the VM. Probably you'll hit a ceiling where the used disk space stops growing. If not, please detail what you're using the Mac for exactly and which files you find are growing unlimited. It is not standard for Macs to just keep using unlimited amounts of disk space in /private when run 24x7.
