iMac Digital Audio Output and Google Chrome Issue <body> I'm using Google Chrome 13.0.782.32 beta as my preferred browser, and I'm also utilizing the digital optical output from my (late 2009) imac into a Digital-to-Analog converter (which then feeds into two computer speaker sets for a 4.2 setup). I've set my audio preferences to 96 kHz, 2-channel @ 24 bit in the Audio Midi setup menu. I'm getting no sound when using Google Chrome, but Safari 5.0.5 works fine. Any ideas?  Thanks!  <comment19137> With the latest update of Chrome, the issue has now been fixed!
