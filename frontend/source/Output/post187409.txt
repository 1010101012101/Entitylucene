First line above  precodeecho 'kern.maxfiles=20480' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf /code/pre  Second line above.Setting environment variables. Can be set up ... Use this link. A short but useful how-to.  Third line above: /etc/profile exists.  precodeecho 'ulimit -n 4096' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile /code/pre  <comment221530> See this page on [Unix StackExchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/188306/increasing-ulimit-u-settings-temporarily-in-osx-yosemite) for a possible answer. <comment221684> Thanks, yes that answered it as well as this post on another site. http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/tuning/open-files-limit/#Mac-OS-X Now I just have to get Dovecot to recognise it.  master: Warning: fd limit (ulimit -n) is lower than required under max. load (256  1000), because of default_client_limit
