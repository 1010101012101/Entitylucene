How to upgrade to specific release on Mac OS X (e.g. 10.7.3)? <body> I have an old iPhone application which was created using Xcode 4.3.2. I want to get it running on Xcode. However, I am using OS X 10.9.5. So I get the error "This installation of Xcode 4.3.2 requires Mac OS X Lion". So I searched online and found an article about running Xcode 4.3.2 on VirtualBox. Now when I try to install Xcode 4.3.2 on Lion on VirtualBox, I get the error message "You have Mac OS X 10.7. The application requires Mac OS X 10.7.3 or later. How can I upgrade to 10.7.3 to get Xcode working?  <answer230270> If you start from a base install - 10.n.0 then you can always directly update to a given 'point release' by using the Combo Updater for that release.  These appear to emalways/em remain available from Apple.  The Combo updater for 10.7.3 is at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1484  <answer230271> Simply use a so-called Combo Updater:  Download at least OS X Lion Update 10.7.3 (Client Combo). This will update your 10.7.0 installation to 10.7.3 and contains all other point releases in between (10.7.1.&amp; 10.7.2).  Other Lion Combo Updates are available here: OS X Lion Combo Update search
