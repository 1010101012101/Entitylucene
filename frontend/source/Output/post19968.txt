File sizes greyed out (strange extended attributes) in Finder on Lion? <body> I just got a new machine with Lion preinstalled. After transferring all my applications, I noticed that the file sizes (and only the sizes) of some applications and folders are greyed out:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q0C4i.png" alt="example for greyed out files"  Does anybody know what this means?  strongUpdate:/strong  codels -la/code gives the following lines for DjView and Dropbox:  precodedrwxr-xr-x   3 daniel  staff    102 31 Okt  2007 DjView.app drwxr-xr-x@  3 daniel  staff    102  3 Mai 10:06 Dropbox.app /code/pre  I.e. Dropbox.app has extended file attributes, namely  precode$ xattr -p com.apple.FinderInfo Dropbox.app/ 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 /code/pre  Cheers  MrMage  <answer20173> It seems that those Apps are only sym links. Maybe those apps are in your ~/Applications folder, and are linked to the /Applications one.  Could you check it.  Edited to reflect the edit of the author.  <answer22318> I have only the craziest of guesses, but since we're all striking out so far, here goes.  Is there any chance you've turned on the Asepsis mode which installs a kernel extension? You may have not disabled that in your testing (a safe boot should confirm / rule this out as well). It seems possible that it's intentionally showing you which folders it has replaced the normal code.DS_store/code file with entries in code/usr/local/.dscache/code  I would also use codemdls/code to inspect the metadata for these folders (since apps are really folders these days) in case some clue jumps out at you.  <comment22043> Very interesting! I'm not seeing the same thing on my system. <comment22060> Have you run a fix permissions after the migration? You shouldn't have to but that might be the reason. <comment22297> Guess: The greyed out apps are PowerPC (and won't work under Lion)? <comment22355> These are good suggestions for starting to get to the bottom of this odd problem. <comment22874> Updated the original post with the information you requested. <comment23101> They aren't. In fact, they are located on /SSD/Applications (which is not the system partition), but the same gray text appears next to some applications in the /Applications folder. <comment23105> Have you tried to re-download the greyed out apps which resides in the /Applications folder? <comment23202> There are even some Apple applications affected. As it seems, they have the special attributes mentioned above, but I don't know what they mean. <comment23256> Can you post the output of `file Dropbox.app`? <comment23686> MrMage: Dropbox.app on my system has exactly the same extended attributes, and no grey size. So I don't think that can be the issue. An odd one, this. <comment23707> Hey, any luck with the output of `file Dropbox.app`? <comment23714> Sorry, your comments weren't shown to me. The result is just `Dropbox.app/: directory`. I think the output of `xattr` (see original post) is more relevant in this case. <comment23715> You are right. There also are grey files _without_ extended attributes. <comment23722> The size of my Dropbox app is not greyed out but still     ` xattr -p com.apple.FinderInfo Dropbox.app/ 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` Sorry for the mess, I don't know how to insert a CR in the comments. However they look exactly like yours. <comment23723> Moreover: ls -l | grep @ show me that `Marked.app` has a `drwxr-xr-x@  3 gio   staff   102 Aug 10 05:42 Marked.app ` but ` xattr -p com.apple.FinderInfo Marked.app  ` gives me `xattr: Marked.app: No such xattr: com.apple.FinderInfo ` <comment23735> Do you see this in all user accounts? <comment23784> There's just this one. <comment23785> By the way, I'm using TotalFinder (but this behavior persists when I disable TotalFinder). <comment24011> If you don't see it in other user accounts I wouldn't worry about it too much. It is probably due to some odd configuration setting. <comment24031> I saw it temporarily with plenty of applications in `/Applications`, but eventually, all sizes became black. I've also checked whether this is related to HFS+ compression; that is *not* the case. Are we sure this doesn't simply mean that Finder is still busy calculating the size? <comment24033> As long as it's calculating it doesn't show any size. Also, that calculation should be done almost immediately as the files are placed on a SSD. <comment24763> I indeed have Asepsis enabled, and simply deleting the (still-present) .DS_Store in the Applications folder removed all the gray sizes. Thanks a ton!
