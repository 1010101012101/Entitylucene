Is it possible to customize Apple's holiday Calendar? <body> I use the Apple UK Holiday Calendar on my Mac and iPhone, and it's nice to know when Easter is, but St George's Day and The Battle of the Boyne (in Glasgow for crying out loud) I can well do without. However, it seems that Holidays are just on or off. Anyone know a hack to customize or to create one's own?  <comment288275> You could forgo using these calendars and put in the special days yourself. I put St. David's day on my personal calendar because it is **not** on the US calendar, but St Patrick's day is. The patron saint of Wales is far more important to me than some dude who drove away non-existant snakes. :-) <comment288278> Suppose so. Easter is the problem. It's not for religious reasons, but if you are able to, it's best avoided when taking skiing holidays in Europe. (For the same reason it would good to be able to add French school holidays ;-) )
