ssh over USB - ssh_exchange_identification <body> I would to connect my Mac Mini to iPad Air through ssh over USB.  I've installed libimobiledevice and so also iproxy, to forward the local TCP port over the USB connection.  After I run in a terminal codeiproxy 2222 22/code, in another I run codessh -vvv -p 2222 root@localhost/code. But the connection is a failure!  The output of codessh/code is:  precode$ ssh -vvv -p 2222 root@localhost OpenSSH_7.3p1, LibreSSL 2.4.1 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug2: resolving "localhost" port 2222 debug2: ssh_connect_direct: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to localhost [::1] port 2222. debug1: connect to address ::1 port 2222: Connection refused debug1: Connecting to localhost [127.0.0.1] port 2222. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/alfonsocryptonet/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/alfonsocryptonet/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/alfonsocryptonet/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/alfonsocryptonet/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/alfonsocryptonet/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/alfonsocryptonet/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/alfonsocryptonet/.ssh/id_ed25519 type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/alfonsocryptonet/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert type -1 debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.3 ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host /code/pre  While the output of codeiproxy/code is:  precode$ iproxy 2222 22 waiting for connection accepted connection, fd = 4 waiting for connection Number of available devices == 1 Requesting connecion to device handle == 1 (serial: 01c5e677f2057b33ee76dd8aa0d2b9098a409043), port 22 Error connecting to device! /code/pre  On the iPad i've correctly installed OpenSSH, indeed with a Linux machine the connection is a success, with the same process  Note that I've run also codessh-keygen/code so the id_rsa file exists!
