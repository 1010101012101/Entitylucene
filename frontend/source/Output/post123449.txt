Cannot arrange finder files and folder by name <body> In OS X 10.9.2, I cannot arrange finder's files and folder by name and the files are sorted by random alphabetical order. Is that a bug or any work around?   <answer123462> Have you tried changing both the Sort By and Arrange By modes? The Sort By mode can be changed from the view options (command-J), or View  Arrange By turns to Sort By if you hold option.  <answer158426> I got it to alphabetize by holding down Option.  <answer179780> Finder offers two sorting methods: Arrange By and Sort By.  In column view:  ol liClick View  Arrange By  None/li liHold down the Option key and click View  Sort By  Name/li /ol  <answer195501> If you're having issues with changing the sort order, first sort by "none" and then resort. Holding the option key produces different order options. I solved my column view problem of folders being put at the bottom of the list as opposed to the top of my list using this.  <comment163170> Problem now appears to be carried over to OS X 10.9.4 - it is possible to arrange files in all view options (overflow etc) EXCEPT column view. Even if you arrange files in another view type, the moment you with to column view, the files and folders are sorted randomly. This has to be an ongoing bug. <comment233889> Thanks. This is also useful for another bug, when the list view headers don't respond to mouse clicks
