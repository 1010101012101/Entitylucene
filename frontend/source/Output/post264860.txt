iBooks Collections disappeared. How do I get them back? <body> I had around 100 books which where categorized in my iBooks. Over the years, I had created these Collections, but today when I was cleaning my desktop, I accidently deleted .thumbs hidden file. I have two other hidden files .localized and .DS_Store. I am not sure if that is the reason my collections were lost. Is there anyway I can get back my collections? I can access my Books.plist file as well as all my pdfs.  <comment332065> Deleting any of those files (thumbs.db, .localized, .DS_Store) definitely could not damage your collections. What else did you possibly do beside deleting those hidden files? <comment332078> Do you have a backup? Are you using Time Machine? <comment332080> @DenisRasulev Opened a .epub file after deleting those hidden files. <comment332081> @pjctech Yes, I do have a backup, but it is a month old. How will it help?
