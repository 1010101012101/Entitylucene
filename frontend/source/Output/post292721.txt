Codesigning shell scripts don't always work <body> I have a macOS Sierra virtual machine that I would like to use (re)sign ipa files, but I keep running into problems. Sometimes IPA files sign fine in the virtual machine but for other files, there's always some problem associated with the ipa file.   If I sign the ipas that are having problems on the virtual machine with my MacBook using the same code signing script then it works perfectly. So how come the same result isn't produced on the virtual machine?  Here are some of the scripts I use:  https://github.com/CartoDB/mobile-dotnet-samples/blob/master/resign.sh https://github.com/xndrs/XReSign/blob/master/XReSign/Scripts/xresign.sh  On the VM I am using codesecurity unlock-keychain -p &lt;YourPassword&gt; ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain/code to unlock the keychain so that the scripts can access the certificate.  I wish that there were error outputs that I could provide to see why sometimes these scripts don't work perfectly on the VM, but unfortunately there aren't errors being outputted.
