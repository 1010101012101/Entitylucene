I don't really understand the other websites instructions.  <answer69741> I am guessing your forte is not computers, this is not the best method, nor the fastest by any stretch; in fact it could possibly be the slowest way to do it. But it will work.   ul liboot into windows/li listart migration assistant and copy all your settings and apps and docs to an external HD /li liGo back to osx/li liDelete w7 partition/li lirun bootcamp assistant./li liredownload the Windows Support files if you lost them (important)/li lichoose new partiton size/li lireinstall windows /li lireinstall Windows support (apple drivers)/li lirun migration assistant again and copy all your settings and apps and docs back./li /ul  There are other ways to do it (buying Paragon Partition Manager for instance) but this way its slow but free and almost impossible to screw up your computer.  <answer81246> I would recommend using a tool such as Paragon.  That way you don't have to go through the backup, delete, create process.  http://www.paragon-software.com/home/camptune/  Check out his article as well...  http://guides.macrumors.com/Extend_or_Resize_Boot_Camp_Partition
