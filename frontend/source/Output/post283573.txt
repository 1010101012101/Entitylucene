macOS Sierra Spotlight search does not find Numbers but Number <body> My Spotlight search behaves strange and I don't know how to fix it.  Any Ideas?  When I want to open Numbers, I hit kbdcommand/kbdkbd space /kbd and start typing "number",  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQE3g.png" alt="spotlight screenshot"  but if I keep on typing the "s", essentially completing the app name Numbers, Spotlight does not know what to do anymore.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEni7.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does the index point into a wrong direction? If I search for a specific file it works.  I tried the solutions by Anil and Senseful here, but the problem does not change  strongUPDATE/strong  After rebuilding the Spotlight library the problem shortly disappeared (one week). But it returned again. So maybe my question is not how to solve this problem but strongwhat is corrupting my Spotlight index?/strong  Interestingly the Spotlight results look a bit different now and shows the App-Store Numbers version (which then automatically opens the local one).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HXg4n.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer283596> I would start by rebuilding the Spotlight index.  From: How to rebuild the Spotlight index on your Mac     ol   liChoose Apple menu ()  System Preferences, then click Spotlight./li   liClick the Privacy tab./li   liDrag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Or click the   Add (+) button and select the folder or disk to add.br   To add an item to the Privacy tab, you must have ownership permissions for that item. To learn about permissions, choose Help   from the Finder menu bar, then search for “permissions.”/li   liFrom the same list of locations, select the folder or disk that you just added. Then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the   list./li   liQuit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk./li   /ol   Or via Terminal:  precodesudo mdutil -i off / sudo mdutil -i on / sudo mdutil -E /code/pre  See the man page for codemdutil/code or type codeman mdutil/code in Terminal.  <answer283605> I would first do as suggested in Hefewe1zen's answer, rebuild the Spotlight index on your Mac.  If that doesn't fix the issue, then the next thing I'd try is rebuilding the Launch Services Database.  In Terminal:  precode/S*/L*/F*/C*/F*/L*/S*/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  I always use the short form of the emcommand/em above, however here is the long form:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  There is no manual page for codelsregister/code however, the following emcommand/em outputs the internal help file:  precode/S*/L*/F*/C*/F*/L*/S*/lsregister --help /code/pre  If you want to read more about rebuilding the Launch Services Database, Google is your friend!  If by chance neither of these suggested answers work, then I'd reinstall Numbers.  <comment357582> To whomever down-voted this answer, why!? IMO, its a valid step to take! (Even if it doesn't fix the issue!) +1 <comment357583> Didn't down vote and I agree with @user3439894 ...though you should include the steps to rebuild the index in the answer because links to Apple do (and often) change making them stale. <comment357584> @Allan, I agree with at least a minimum summarizing if to long, although in this case was short enough to just copy the steps and quoted it and where from. Also added man page link/info for `mdutil` however, that said he at least included the Terminal commands, so not quoting the Apple support article shouldn't be grounds to automatically down-vote in this particular case. <comment357585> @user3439894 -  Let me punctuate your last sentence because I agree - there was ***zero*** reason to down vote this answer. <comment358737> thank you @user3439894 for reformatting, I was writing it up while my head was still unsettled. However, I think I should have amphasized a lot more what I already did instead of (just) mentioning the authors of those entries. <comment359583> Did either of these answers help you with your issue? If yes, please up-vote answers and accept answer as appropriate. <comment360301> only the terminal version worked. Using System Preferences (making my HD private and than removing it) did not work, even though I restarted/log-off/on. <comment360302> I am not totally sure when Spotlight worked again. In any case using the terminal commands from the other entry and than using this command solved the problem eventually. <comment360303> Glad to hear you fixed it
