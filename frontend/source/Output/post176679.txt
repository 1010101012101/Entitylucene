How to fix the error: "This disk doesn’t contain an EFI system partition"? <body> I get the following error and cannot start Bootcamp after accidentally deleting the EFI-partition of my main drive.     This disk doesn’t contain an EFI system partition.   If you want to start up your computer with this disk or include it in a RAID set, back up your data and partition this disk.

How do I fix that error?  <answer176685> You can recreate the EFI System Partition (ESP) using the command-line tool gpt. Since you have to modify your current start device you need to boot to Internet Recovery Mode or an external (thumb) drive.  Additionally you need a valid EFI-partition or an image file of it.  Here is a similar question: How to fix broken EFI partition?. I have copied some of the steps of the accepted answer. Check all the warnings there before proceeding. So please credit the OP.  strongPreparation:/strong    ul liBackup your data./li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite).

As you can see, they recommend you clone an existing ESP rather than recreating the file system with codenewfs_msdos/code. If you have an external drive with a GPT partition table (OSX install stick should have it), you can clone that.  strongMake sure you have your disk and partition numbers the right way around or you may overwrite data:/strong  If disk1 is your external drive, and it contains an ESP as the first partition (disk1s1) and disk0 is the drive whose ESP (disk0s1) you want to fix, run this command:  precodesudo dd if=/dev/disk1s1 of=/dev/disk0s1 /code/pre  you have to enter an admin password.  This will copy every single block of disk1's ESP and overwrite the corresponding block in disk0's ESP with it.  Alternatively, take a gamble with codenewfs_msdos/code./li /ul  <comment208685> There is a answer in your question already. Restore your disk. You still have the EFI on the disk but it might be broken.
