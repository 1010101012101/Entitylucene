Which Apple devices support OKC (Opportunistic Key Caching aka PKC/Proactive Key Caching) <body> In enterprise wireless environments, access point roaming/hopping is very common. There exists a couple protocols/methods for making this seamless. That is, to make re-authentication when hopping to the next AP on an SSID smooth.  One is called Opportunistic Key Caching or sometimes called Proactive Key Caching, abbreviated OKC or PKC.  Here is a PDF from Aruba Networks describing OKC/PKC  Here is a Cisco page describing PMK Caching vs OKC vs CCKM  Windows and various Linux OSes support this protocol.   Apple OSX supports a similar thing called Pairwise Master Key ID Validation (PMKID Validation). From the Cisco link, we see that OKC is preferable to PMKID Caching when seamless AP hopping is the number 1 goal.  Question 1:  ul liDoes current OSX support the OKC/PKC protocol/method? How about current iOS? As of 2011, according to Aruba, Apple does not support OKC/PKC./li /ul  Question 2:  ul liIs PMKID Caching the same as PMKID Validation?/li /ul
