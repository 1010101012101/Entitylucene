What Audio Drivers do I need <body> I am using a new Macbook Pro which is running OS X Lion. I have installed Cockos Reaper Daw, and want to use the internal speakers for playback. I note in the properties/Audio/ Device options I only have default input and output options, no ASIO, or core Audio drivers, do I need to download these? Sorry if this is an obvious question but I am new to Macs and Reaper!!  <comment118185> Id this the OSX System Properties or in the Program's properties? What happens when you use the default options?
