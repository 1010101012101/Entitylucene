Shared Photostream and IPad 1 (first generation) <body> I want to shared some photos stored on my Mac to my wife's IPad (the old one, 1st generation).  I have created a Shared PhotoStream album. My wife correctly received the invitation/notification.   She could open this shared photos on her iPhone 4 (iOS6) but it's seems not working on her iPad (1st gen / iOS5).  How can I make it work?  <answer77514> Short Answer: strongYou can't/strong  Shared PhotoStream is a feature of iOS 6 and therefore not available on iOS 5. Some users claim they had gotten the feature working and enabled by removing and re-adding the iCloud account, however I have never seen it work.  From the official description of a shared PhotoStream (Bold by me):     Select photos directly from the Photos app in strongiOS 6, iPhoto or Aperture/strong on a Mac
