Is FCP X 10.1.1 hanging because of older hardware? <body> I'm weighing the value of upgrading my machine because FCP X 10.1.1 is constantly hanging—more than once per 5 minutes—and I'm at a loss what to do. Is this just because I have older (Mid-2010) Xeon processors? Could there be other hardware issues contributing to this?   Choose your own adventure in answering my question:  ul liIf I can get more life out of this machine, that would be great. In that case, please share any troubleshooting next steps. /li liOn the other hand, if I'm being unrealistic to try to keep this machine alive, convince me./li /ul  My projects are stored on the boot disk, an internal 3rd-party SSD. I'm running a high-powered albeit older machine with the latest version of FCP X and OS X. Hardware specs below.  The issue is sometimes concurrent with this error message from the Console: Final Cut Pro[3457]: em*/em OpenGL error 0x0506 (invalid framebuffer operation) in function "GL_CHECK_CURRENT_ERROR"  I've submitted feedback to Apple's development team.  Detailed system information:  Model Mac Pro Mid 2010 Processor  2 x 2.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon [8-Core] Memory  16 GB 1066 MHz DDR3 ECC Graphics  ATI Radeon HD 5770 1024 MB Software  OS X 10.9.3 Storage Physical Drive:   Media Name: Crucial_CT480M500SSD1 Media   Medium Type: SSD   Protocol: SATA   Internal: Yes   Partition Map Type: GPT (GUID Partition Table)   S.M.A.R.T. Status: Verified  <answer138663> I think my hardware is just fine. Upgrading to FCP X 10.1.2 solved the issue for me.
