Can't archive mail on one of my Exchange accounts <body> I have a few Exchange accounts set up in Mail that are working fine.  Deleting sends the mail to the Trash folder, archiving sends the mail to the Archive folder.  However, one of the accounts won't let me archive.  The mailbox has a folder under the "Archive" section on the sidebar, and I can manually drag messages to it, but when I click Archive I get the following:  strongThe message “[subject]” could not be moved to the mailbox “(null)”/strong  strongThe destination mailbox does not exist./strong  I would assume this means that Mail can't find the appropriate folder to put the message in, but since the account has a folder under the Archive heading, I'm confused.  Any ideas?  <answer64799> I had the same problem. I went into Preferences  Accounts and deselected "Enable this account." Then, I quit Mail and restarted it. I went back into Preferences  Accounts and selected "Enable this account" and it all started working.  <answer241789> h2Rename the Archive folder on Exchange/h2  Seems some sort of bad situation manifested itself between Mail and the Exchange server. I had to Rename the folder named codeArchive/code on the server to codeOldArchive/code, then attempt to archive a message and allow Mail to recreate the codeArchive/code folder. Then I copied all the mail in codeOldArchive/code to the new codeArchive/code.  <comment76190> Fantastic!  This works.  Thanks. <comment136532> Thank you very much!
