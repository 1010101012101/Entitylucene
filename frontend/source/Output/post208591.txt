How do I press hotkey ⇥ <body> I have an OS X application, which has shortcut  precode^⌥⇥ /code/pre  I know that it means Ctrl + Alt/Option + ???  I can't figure out what does last character mean. I tried Fn+Right, Fn+Down, it doesn't work. I have Macbook keyboard, so no "End" button here.  <answer208614> strongIt's tab./strong The same character is printed on the keyboard.  <comment251564> isn't this tab? <comment251565> Yes, it is Tab :) Thanks! <comment251600> not on mine keyboards. There is just the word "tab" printed. <comment251607> Same here. Now I remember than this character is printed on PC keyboards, I just forgot about that, since I used it long time ago. <comment251613> It's printed on my MacBook Pro keyboard @cello :)
