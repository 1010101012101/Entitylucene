edit a .jpg file in preview <body> I have typed the name of a bird on a .jpg photo. I made a spelling mistake and tried to edit it. I can create a new text box but not edit the original. Is there a way to edit a text box once you have saved the file  <answer292729> No, there is no way to edit the text after saving the image.  You may be able to revert to a previous version of the image, before the misspelt text was written:  ol liOpen the image in Preview.app/li liSelect the menu item: strongFile  Revert To  Browse All Versions/strong/li /ol  <comment369322> A note: make sure you save a JPEG with exactly the same quality settings as you opened it with and when cropping only crop aligned to a 16x16 grid, otherwise you'll lose quality in the unedited areas. <comment369332> You were working on a copy - not the original?
