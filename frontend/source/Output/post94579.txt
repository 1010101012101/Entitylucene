How can I set up an "always-on" ipad videoconference kiosk? <body> I'd like to keep two separate groups of employees connected via a videoconference device on the cheap.   I'd like to have two tablets at the two locations, and either a) have them always be connected via a videoconference feed, or b) allow either tablet to call the other at any time and establish a feed without requiring the other tablet to manually accept the connection.  Is there a way to do this using things like skype, google+ hangouts, cisco jabber, etc?
