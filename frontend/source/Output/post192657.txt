I broke my PATH by editing my ~/.bash_profile and Bash will not recognize most commands <body> in .bash_profile I accidentally set the path to:  precodePATH="~/Tools/apache-maven-3.3.3/bin" /code/pre  and now the default path is gone. Nothing in Terminal works anymore:  precodeKorays-MacBook-Pro:~ koraytugay$ ls -bash: ls: command not found Korays-MacBook-Pro:~ koraytugay$ mkdir test -bash: mkdir: command not found /code/pre  I can not see hidden files in Finder so I can not modify .bash_profile from Finder as well.  How can I fix this situation?  <answer192658> The simplest way is to restore from a backup e.g from Time Machinebr However if the last backup is long enough ago that there is other changes you want to keep the you can edit .bash_profile  strongIn terminal/strong  In a terminal you can use the full path to the editors ( /usr/bin/emacs /usr/bin/vi or /usr/bin/nano) to edit ~/.bash_profile  e.g.  precode/usr/bin/nano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Or you could open it with the default text editor (by default TextEdit) via:  precode/usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  strongIn GUI - from Dock or Finder/strong  But also you can do this from TextEdit (or other GUI editors) by File-Open and go to your home directory. Depending on if you have set Finder to show all  files or not show hidden ones (the default) you will either see .bash_profile in the list or you can hit kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd./kbd which reveals hidden files in Open/Save dialogs. (the shortcut is from this answer)  <answer192777> Open your .bash_profile, go to the line with your error command and put a  #  before it as first character of the line. Restart (to be sure).  <answer251187> h2Bring back a minimal PATH/h2  Enter the following command to reset a minimal PATH:  precodePATH=/bin:/usr/bin /code/pre  h2Fix code~/.bash_profile/code/h2  Edit your code~/.bash_profile/code with your preffered text editor codevi/code, codeemacs/code or codeTextEdit/code. Always prefer a relative PATH construct:  precodePATH=${PATH}:...my_personal_added_pathes... export PATH /code/pre  h2Test it/h2  Before proceeding as too many beginners do by restarting your session, to discover that they can't anymore start a shell. Test your code~/.bash_profile/code: open another codeTerminal/code window, and check that it is working fine:  precode. ~/.bash_profile ls uptime date ... /code/pre  <comment229314> This may not work on a BSD-ish system: try restoring a default path with `PATH=$(getconf PATH)`, otherwise do `PATH=/bin:/usr/bin` <comment229318> The "getconf PATH" suggestion does indeed work fine, on 10.10 at least. <comment229335> Since the PATH is mangled then glenn's suggestion will work with `PATH=$(/usr/bin/getconf PATH)` <comment229502> How does he open his .bash_profile? <comment312198> Users who can't fix the described problem themselves probably are better of using `nano` instead of `emacs`/`vi` to edit `~/.bash_profile`. <comment312206> There's no need to `export` your minimal `PATH`. Any process started by the current shell will inherit the minimal `PATH`.  Though, I would use`export  PATH` in a shell config file. <comment312208> Right! I'm so used to type it this way in environnements where there are shell scripts at test.
