Is there way to know when last logged in and out? <body> Is it possible to know when I last time logged in and out?  I would prefer to access this information from Terminal, but a GUI tool is also okay.  <answer123350> In the Terminal application, type codelast/code and voil√†, there is your answer!  <comment144015> Great!
