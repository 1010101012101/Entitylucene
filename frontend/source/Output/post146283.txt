Apple App Store submission review time vs update time <body> I've released an app to the App Store, it's been waiting for review for about 9 days.  Upon running my own dev version I've realised I'd left a critical part out. Would it be worth waiting for release and then pushing an update or remove it and resubmit?  Will the update be processed faster than a resubmission?  <answer146284> Updates are generally processed faster than the first submission of an app for review, but not emdrastically/em faster. It's usually around a day shorter (5 days) compared with the average 6 or 7 days for a first submission.  Note that iOS 8 has caused an increase in submissions and a consequential increase in review times; Apple may be prioritising updates more to make apps compatible with iOS 8.  <answer174990> Check out this resource http://appreviewtimes.com/ . Very handy but it doesn't distinguish between first submissions and updates unfortunately.  <answer179673> If you check Apple's developer site they list the percent of new and updates approved in 5 business days or less. I'm not sure how accurate this is because in my experience it usually takes 7-10 days to get either a new app or update approved and far longer if you get rejected.  Apple's review claims link: https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/app-review/  Actual times from statistical sample: http://appreviewtimes.com/  Between the two there is a big discrepancy, or I am just really unlucky as it takes about 10 days (7 business days or so) for me to get updates through for You Doodle.  <comment223793> Do you have a link for that? <comment223847> @HaemEternal Added links <comment225509> In my experience this is not true. I've submitted a number of new apps and updates, and both in the last 6 months have taken around 10-14 days
