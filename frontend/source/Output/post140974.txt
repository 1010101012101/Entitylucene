iTunes mixes up Aperture and iPhoto <body> I use iPhoto for my mobile (iPhone, iPad) pictures and I have a separate library in Aperture for the pictures I take with my DSLR.  Until now I was just transferring my mobile photos to iPhoto.  Now I want to sync my iPhoto library (at least some of my albums) to my iPhone. The problem is: in iTunes, in the photo tab, I have only one option in the "Sync photos from" dropdown, iPhoto, BUT when I select it, it's the Aperture library that shows up.  It seems to me that there was a time when I had both options, iPhoto and Aperture, in the dropdown. It must have come from an update…  Any ideas on how to sort thing up?  <answer141086> Ok, found it.   You just have to create a new library (open iPhoto with the kbdalt/kbd key pressed), quit iPhoto, and open it again with kbdalt/kbd pressed and select the original library file. Open iTunes, et voilà!
