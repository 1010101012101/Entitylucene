adb got stuck. not starting in terminal command <body> When I start the adb deamon using the terminal, it got stuck somewhere. Any idea why ?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8zeMc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  PS: I am using OSX Mavericks.   <answer113907> Try it with:  precodesudo adb start-server /code/pre  Use your own password.  Opening port 5037 doesn't require privileged access, but there are some other flaky things with adb such as file/device permissions, etc. to which your own user account might not have access.  <comment132404> Do you get some messages in Console.app  ? <comment132405> @MatthieuRiegler Nope nothing at all. It just always like that.. I have no idea why.. <comment133950> Have you tried reinstalling your Android SDK? I had a number of small problems with Android and its tools when I upgraded from OS X 10.8 to 10.9 and reinstalling the SDK seems to have fixed them all. <comment135013> Still the same.. :(
