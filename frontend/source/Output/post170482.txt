Problems with a simple shell script <body> I've faced with the problem of using simple shell commands like AWK and print within my sh scripts on my Mac ( the same script works perfect on the Linux). For instance below script which seek for the columns within given input files didn't works  precode #! /usr/bin/env bash input=/Users/Own/Documents/Science/mmgbsa_results/All_decomp2/logs output=/Users/Own/Documents/Science/mmgbsa_results/All_decomp2/out  for file in $input/*; do title=$(basename "$file") #print $title awk -F’[|]’ '{print $1,$NF}' $file &gt; ${output}/$title done /code/pre  output:  precodeawk: no program given  analysis.sh: line 11: ]’: command not found awk: no program given  analysis.sh: line 11: ]’: command not found awk: no program given  analysis.sh: line 11: ]’: command not found awk: no program given  analysis.sh: line 11: ]’: command not found awk: no program given  analysis.sh: line 11: ]’: command not found awk: no program given /code/pre  Here some tests of the shell:  precodeGlebs-MacBook-Pro:All_decomp2 Own$ echo $PATH /Users/Own/anaconda/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin Glebs-MacBook-Pro:All_decomp2 Own$ awk usage: awk [-F fs] [-v var=value] [-f progfile | 'prog'] [file ...] Glebs-MacBook-Pro:All_decomp2 Own$ peint -bash: peint: command not found /code/pre  <comment200388> What is peint? Can you run an example awk command on one line - Note Linux uses gnu awk and OS X BSD awk so there could be a difference there - also what is line 11? <comment200389> Could you post your `$PATH`? I tested, and your script works, so, the problem seems to be that can reach `awk` command. A quick fix can be append the path to the `awk`, using `/usr/bin/awk` instead. <comment200396> actually it was Print which has not been worked ( <comment200416> Your quotes after the -F in the awk command are wrong, they need to be `'` <comment200689> 0942v8653 has the right idea. Make sure you're using a text editor to write your scripts, not a word processor.
