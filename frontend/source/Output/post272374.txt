Extremely Slow Response Times After New HD Install <body> I recently swapped out my 128GB SSD HD for a platter based Western Digital 1TB HD. I did a clean install of Sierra and just reinstalled all my apps. My files are stored in Dropbox.  Now granted, I know a going back to a platter HD vs as SSD there is going to be some response time difference. Not like this: Photoshop takes 3 minutes to open. Excel 2 minutes. Loading up XCode or an Android Simulator I might as well take my lunch break. Restoring file from Dropbox took 3 days. I have gigabit internet and plugged up the MacBook Pro to the router directly. Still didn't help.  I have reset PRAM and SMC. I have ran disk repair utility. No issues.  The drive is not encrypted.      Surely there is something else I can do? I am desperate. I will even scrub the HD and reformat if necessary. I just thought I would check to see if anyone else has had this issue and what you did to resolve it.  I have a   ul li17" MacBook Pro Mid 2010 /li li2.53GHZ Intel Core i5/li li8GB 1067 MHz DDR3/li lirunning Sierra 10.12.3/li /ul  Running Onyx the only "out of the ordinary" thing I could see is this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9H1bx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Anyone know if that is important?  Here is the HD disk utility info:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSsg4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment342337> Did you try something like [Blackmagic Disk Speed Test](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12) on it? Even using a slower SATAII machine I get 250MB/s on an SSD but only 100MB/s on an HD. It makes a colossal difference to response times if I boot from the HD instead. iTunes, for instance, takes a minute to launch instead of 5 seconds. <comment342338> I'll try that out. <comment342341> What's concerning is that SMART status says "Not Supported."  Very concerning.  I'd bet that your drive is failing. <comment342345> It's brand new. :-( I'll just return it and get another SSD. <comment342378> Brand new doesn't mean its working. Infant mortality is a significant likelihood.
