Make the iBooks search useful <body> Is it possible to make the iBooks search useful? It seems to totally lack any way of forcing capitalisation or word boundaries. I would use Regular Expressions if necessary.  By way of example I was searching a Python book for the word "Eric" but could find no way of stopping it telling me the thousands of references to numstrongeric/strong or numstrongeric/strongal
