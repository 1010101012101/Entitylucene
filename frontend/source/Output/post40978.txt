Recipe manager for iOS <body> I am looking for a recipe manager for my iPod Touch and my requirements are:  ol liIt must not require online registration and it must be fully functional offline (it's okay if it has "cloud" features, but they must not be required)/li liIt must be either free, or under $3 (I don't do a lot of cooking—I just have some favorite recipes I would like to keep handy—and I'm not willing to invest too much)/li liOf course, it must allow me to add my own recipes/li /ol  I don't really need in-app features like shopping list management, timers, etc.  <answer40980> What about strongNotes/strong? It ships with iOS, and you can use it to store notes about anything, including recipes.  <answer40982> I use PlainText it's free, with a $2 in-app upgrade to remove the ads if you don't like them.  I find that plain text is easy to store (search!) and share my recipes with. I use it on iPad and iPhone and have a reasonable collection of recipes on there. The Dropbox sync makes it easy to add existing recipes from other sources, or to back up.  <comment46401> I do have PlainText, and I've considered using it for recipes.
