How to restore default permissions in Sierra? <body> Apple thinks that SIP is a perfect solution. The official view seems to be that SIP prevents every possible corruption of file permissions in Sierra so effectively that repairing permissions should be a problem of the past.  Apple is so convinced of this reasoning that they removed the ability to repair the permissions from Disk Utility and the command line tools.  This is of course an unfortunate move. Previously "Repair the Permissions!" was a frequently abused voodoo advice. But sometimes that would indeed solve a problem â€“ when the problem was with these permissions. And they can still become a problem, even with Sierra and SIP.  ul liWhat happens if SIP is disabled?   Users or processes can then mess up the permissions. How to restore these permissions to their factory settings?/li liWhat happens if the boot drive is not the primary root partition?  SIP is effectively useless then. It then does not prevent Users or processes to alter the permissions on the primary root drive then. How to restore these permissions to their factory settings?/li /ul  There may be more situations or circumstances that the permissions on a Sierra installation divert from the state they should be in.  What is the current best practice to remedy such a situation once it has occured?  <comment374309> Best practice is as has been under osx is find which process messed up the permissions and fix that then undo what it did. Repair permissions has never been best practice <comment374334> That doesn't address the multi-boot scenario. It could take quite a while to notice that the unprotected volume had its permissions, and only them, messed up. "Reinstall macOS", is then typically said in Apple related forums, even when that would be an overkill 'solution' for this situation. And easily fixed if one had this factory set of permissions to re-apply to the OS files.
