Our iPad is locked and we're not sure of the Apple ID / iCloud password <body> My Granddaughter has lost/forgotten her ID and passwords for her iPad. When the iPad powers on, it goes straight to an iCloud password request and I cannot get past it.  I have installed iTunes on my laptop but it fails to connect to the server (error 310).  I installed iCloud control panel and tried a restore but that failed because of "Find my iPad" was active, which I cannot turn off because of the original password problem!  This is driving me crazy. I just want to reset everything now so that I can hand it back to her. Can anyone help?  <answer116012> strongYou can't bypass Activation Lock without entering your Apple ID./strong  You can attempt to reset your Apple ID password at https://appleid.apple.com. You'll be expected to answer a few questions regarding your account.  <answer116013> If the iPad is a recent gift, Apple offers free support to guide you in reclaiming access to her iCloud account. You can't unlock or restore the iPad with iTunes as the device is truly locked until her password is remembered or reset.   ul lihttps://getsupport.apple.com to see if you get free support/li lihttps://AppleID.apple.com to self service reset the password /li lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5818 how activation lock works and what to do in your case to recover use of the device/li /ul  If you don't know how the account was set up, realize that too many wrong guesses will lock that account and make her go through more questions / answers and possibly have to review purchase history with Apple before getting someone to assist in resetting things.   <answer120374> Give the circumstances of your situation, the only option for you is to make an appointment with a Genius at an Apple Store, bringing with you proof of purchase for the device.  The employee will then reset the password and allow you access to the iPad. Only Apple has the power to truly bypass Activation Lock.  There is no way to bypass iCloud Activation Lock outside of Apple. That is why it is such a powerful feature and theft deterrent.

(names not shown for obvious reasons). <comment135757> @ChrisJones that is likely the user name for the Apple ID, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. AppleID could be any string and mostly people use emails. She could have used name@hotmail.com and been offers the iCloud email for free as part of iCloud. <comment135758> Hi bmike, It could be then that we do not have AppleID or passwords. I think she may have only signed up for iCloud by accident, (she is only 11). Children can easily be duped into signing up for things they don't understand. (and adults as well). <comment135761> I have tried this route but the young lady can not remember the answers she originally gave! <comment186566> I have found a solution: check my answer on my own question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/158663/how-to-know-which-apple-id-is-used-to-lock-ipad-if-the-display-is-dead/158715#158715 <comment350712> What if the account username is unknown?
