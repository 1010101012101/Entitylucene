Macbook Pro early 2012 SSD retire block count <body> I've recently bought an OCZ Vertex3 480 GB SSD (VTX3-25SAT3-480G) for a drive upgrade.  This is what I did after I purchased the drive:  ol liBacked up my system with Carbon copy cloner/li liInstalled the SSD drive/li liInstall OSX Mountain Lion (fresh install from USB drive)/li liInstalled some basic apps and tested the speed (500m read, 250m write) (I've enabled TRIM via TrimEnabler)/li liAttach my backup drive (where I backed up my earlier system) and started copying my data (something like 130GB)/li liOSX strongturned the screen off/strong after 5 min (strongnot sleep/strong)/li liWent back to check and the system froze (beach ball + black screen)/li liForce shutdown pressing the power for 5 sec/li liReboot and found out that: my brand new SSD had 19 "retired block" and 3325114 of "total error"/li /ol  (10?). I've upgraded my firmware from 2.15 to 2.22 after I discovered the 19 bad blocks just to make sure it's not faulty firmware.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzYLo.png" alt="enter image description here"  I got 0 of both when I first booted into the system, after a forced shutdown, I got 19 bad blocks and a bunch of errors.....  Is this normal? Is there something wrong with my SSD? should I send it for warranty?

Taking some information from The SSD Anthology: Understanding SSDs and New Drives from OCZ   If your SSD has a code20KB/code block size, that means that there are about about strong25,165,824/strong blocks for a 480GB SDD and thats not including any of the extra storage that some SSD manufactures include. So only haveing 16 bad blocks out all those block does not look like a problem at all, as for a number that would indicate a failing drive, I am not sure what that would be but I can assume that would be the number of extra block the Manufacture provides, once your SSD uses that up, then you start loosing storage capacity.  According to OCZ Product sheet      Vertex 3 2.5‚Äù SSD  512GB 480GB VTX3-25SAT3-480G 842024025559   Of Note the 512GB is the strongRaw Capacity/strong, so it looks like there is 32GB of extra space for block failures, so that works out to about strong1,677,721/strong total extra blocks of storage.  If the drive is causing problems like spinning cursors, slowness or crashes see below for more suggestions.  ol liA possible solution try formatting the SSD 1 more time and try running it with out TRIM enabled or any other 3rd party SSD tools software. See if the drive can work on its own with just a clean install of OS X, with out any weird crashes./li liIf the drive starts acting up again after the clean install and no 3rd party trim enabler on, it could be that there may be a hardware / software incompatibility between the SATA controller on the Mac and that particular drive. I would try to verify the drive is working OK by placing it in another computer or external hard drive case, etc.  And also try searching around on the web for issues between MacBooks and your particular brand of SSD./li liIf the drive is acting weird on all testing computers and interfaces, then you would have a confirmed failed drive and would have an evident need of a getting the drive replaced under warranty./li /ol  Note: If your having a rough time with the SSD drive it would not be a bad idea contacting OCZ support and explaining to them the issue you are having, they may already have a solution figured out.  <comment72311> This is not normal for sure, the machine locking up like that... <comment72312> what should i do now? <comment72314> Does the MacBook continually lock up after 5 mins or so after every start up? <comment72316> no, that was the only lockup <comment72318> would OCZ accept replacement based on what i have right now? <comment72328> +1 good explanation, can you give some information on the `errors`(3325114) ? <comment72330> so the 19 blocks are just some of the 1,677,721 blocks that can fail before the drive start to have degraded performance and less capacity? <comment72331> In a sense yes, for degraded capacity, can't make any claims on performance though, the manufacture would know best how their product works and fails.
