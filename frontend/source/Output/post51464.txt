Keeping a PDF article's bibliography always visible <body> While reading an article, I like to keep the bibliography pages at the tail of the article visible at the same time as I am going through the pages of the article.  Two obvious ways for doing this are  ol liOpen the pdf article twice, once with Preview and another with Adobe Reader./li liTemporarily make a copy of the article and open both with Preview./li /ol  Am I omitting something? Is there really no natural/easier way to do this on a Mac?  <answer51471> In Adobe Reader, when reading your document, you can choose "New Window" to view two different spots in the same document.  Do it again if you want to view three spots.  <answer51523> Skim.app has two options.  ol licodeView Menu &gt; Show Split View/code splits the view in half/li liPress the kbdCMD/kbd key and highlight the area of interest. A new mini-window will appear with that part visible, leaving the main window for your reading and scrolling./li /ol  <comment68703> The two obvious solutions, duplicating a pdf file or using two different readers, are both silly. This is indeed Skim's "killer feature". It is as fast as Preview and if there is a difference in the quality of rendering, I cannot see it. My only somewhat negative comment after initial use is that Skim is too conservative with thumbnail rendering, waiting until the user skims to a given section.
