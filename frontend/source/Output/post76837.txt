How do I stop GarageBand from always popping up with the message "The Number of Midi Inputs Have Changed" <body> How do I stop GarageBand from always popping up with the message "The Number of Midi Inputs Have Changed"  Every time I unplug or plug-in my Midi keyboard GarageBand always pops up with this message box:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMd5j.png" alt="enter image description here"  It gets annoying since I'm always unplugging my laptop to take it with me but this message always appears.   How do I stop having this message appear?
