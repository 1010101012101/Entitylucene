Alternatives for using USB stick when USB/Thunderbolt ports not working <body> I have an Early 2011 MacBook Pro.  My USB and Thunderbolt ports are not working anymore. I've tried getting the hardware repaired but it wasn't possible.  I have a USB stick that I need to connect to my MacBook in order to be able to work remotely.  Can you think of a way(s) to do that without using the USB/Thunderbolt ports on my MacBook?  Is there such a thing as a wireless USB Hub, that connects to my local Network and I can therefore access the contents of the USB sticks I connect to it via Wi-Fi on my Mac (I don't have a 2nd PC/Mac)? Much like the iTunes libraries that are shared between 2 Macs wirelessly via the local Wi-Fi network.  <answer274174> There are several options...  strongYou can use a NAS (Network Attached Storage)./strong This can be from a dedicated device like a Synology NAS Station (I personally use this device) that not only has physical drives served across the network, but you can attach USB external drives.  I actually have a hub with 3 external drives (for backup and Time Machine) and a USB flash that holds my music collection.  I love this setup (bottom left).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCKuvm.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QDytam.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongYou can use a router with NAS functionality./strong  The Apple Airport Extreme (above right) is a good example of a router with this type of functionality.       AirPort Extreme can turn your external USB hard drive into a secure drive you can share across your Wi‑Fi network and access securely over the Internet. All the documents, videos, photos, and other files instantly become available to anyone on the network, Mac and PC users alike. It’s perfect for file sharing, collaborative projects, and more.   Though I am not a huge fan of "putting all your eggs in one basket," this will make do in a pinch.  br strongWireless USB Flash Disks./strong SanDisk has a wireless flash drive and  I had the opportunity to use one the other day.  I have to admit, it was neat bit of kit; it's not as fast as directly connected USB, but pretty neat and convenient.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/amfNdm.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongShare the USB folder from another Mac/PC./strong By turning on File Sharing, or remote login, you can access the USB by remotely connecting into the machine with the good ports.  Under emSystem Preferences/em just enable file sharing and add the folders (including the code/Volumes/[NameOfUSB]/code folder) into the "Shared Folders" list.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pn5alm.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yzeGSm.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you know how to codessh/code into your machine, you can use codescp/code to copy the files.  You can get more info on how to do this from this answer  Hopefully, one of these methods will allow you to access the files on your USB.
