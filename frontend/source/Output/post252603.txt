OS X Disable/Mute System Messages from Synology <body> Have a number of El Capitan systems connected to Synology NAS shares via AFP, with 'Release resources immediately after disconnect' enabled, and it's causing intermittent 'Server is shutting down' system messages to popup on OSX.  Is it possible to disable or mute these popup messages from within OSX?  I've had a look at the Synology NAS and there doesn't appear to be a method of stopping the messages being sent other than disabling 'Release resources immediately after disconnect' which does appear to cure the problem although it creates others with the AFP shares timing out and OSX not being able to reconnect without either being restarted/rebooted or manually unmounting the shares via Terminal.  Any help will be muchly appreciated!
