Edge resizing on Mac Finder windows? <body> One of the few ways I think Windows beats the Mac is in letting the user resize a window from any edge or corner, not just from the bottom-right corner.   I haven't found any software that enables this functionality on the Mac. Does such a thing exist?  <answer11493> Afloat, a free product by Infinite Labs, will let you resize a window by pressing kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdControl/kbd + Right Click.  Divvy would also work, but Afloat is a free solution.  <answer11494> I know you are looking specifically for edge resizing, but one option would be to use software that lets you set up predefined window sizes/locations that you can apply to a window.  For example, Divvy lets you create presets or drag your mouse against a small grid to locate the window.  I'm just getting started with it but it seems useful.  <answer11510> One of the new features that arrived in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is the ability to resize a window from any edge.  <answer16960> Although this does not answer the OP's actual question (namely, resizing from window edges), since Afloat ended up been mentioned, I wanted to point out another app similar in purpose to Afloat is Zooom/2.  It has the advantage of letting you choose the key bindings for resize (and other) behaviors it implements.  It's not free, but it works.  (I've used both Zooom/2 and Afloat, and have no ties whatsoever to any of the developers.)  <comment12023> possible duplicate of [What Window Management Options exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x) <comment12026> @mankoff: I checked that before I asked my question and it didn't seem to deal specifically with my issue. Now that I've learned about Afloat thanks to Aaron Lake I see that this specific feature is buried at the bottom of a longer list of features in the Afloat entry. Do what you want regarding closing this question, but my question and that one are not duplicative. <comment33469> I tried Afloat, and it was okay; however, I then tried Flexiglass, and I prefer it. However, it does cost money ($8 on App Store), whereas Afloat is free...
