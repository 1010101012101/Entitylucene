You can only jailbreak iPad 2 till 4.3.3. So your version isn't supported by any of the available jailbreak methods at this moment...  <answer39832> If you are running iOS 5.0.1 (or if you update to iOS 5.0.1 through iTunes), you can use Absinthe to JailBreak your iPad 2. Go to http://greenpois0n.com/ and look for the "JailBreak iOS 5.0.1" table on the right of the page. Choose your download, and enjoy! It's really easy and intuitive to JailBreak with Absinthe. For further reference, you can always check out http://www.jailbrea.kr/ for the latest updates and info. Note that Absinthe is only for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 running iOS 5.0.1.  <comment45558> You should check out Absinthe on http://greenpois0n.com. It's for JailBreaking Apple devices with A5 processors on iOS 5.0.1. It was released quite recently. <comment45569> Yes, I know, but you couldn't jailbreak an A5 based device on December 5th :) <comment45636> I totally forgot to check the date on the question/answer. My bad. There aren't enough JailBreaking questions on here.
