Install iDevice drivers but not iTunes? <body> I have a Windows PC that doesn't have iTunes installed, because I don't want it. But I still want to be able to use other software to transfer data from my iPad, which means I need the drivers for it.   Apparently, they only install with iTunes, but is it possible to install them standalone, with no other software needed?  <answer116974> I found this tip from DiskAid website:  You need to manually install the required driver, the "Apple Mobile Device Support" or AMDS.  ol liDownload the iTunes installation package from the official Apple Website./li liYou need a program that can open a CAB file and extract contents from it. 7-zip or WinRar can do it./li liInspect the content of the iTunes installer codeiTunes64Setup.exe/code (that you downloaded in step 1) with 7-zip (right click, 7-zip, Open archive). 7-zip will show the files inside that installer file./li liExtract codeAppleApplicationSupport.msi/code and codeAppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi/code from the installer file to harddisk./li liRun codeAppleApplicationSupport.msi/code and then codeAppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi/code./li /ol  After AppleMobileDeviceSupport64 is installed, windows should be able to detect the iDevice.  <comment39577> couldn't you install then uninstall iTunes? <comment39585> @abc905 I haven't tried that, but I presume that would uninstall the drivers with it.
