How to install SVN binary on Mountain Lion? <body> I just upgraded to Mountain Lion, and now it looks like I need to reinstall the SVN client binary.  I realize I can do this via Homebrew, but isn't this also included in an Apple package in the Mac App Store?  I heard it was removed from the XCode package...  <answer62909> Once you have installed XCode, you can install SVN and other command-line utilities from the Downloads pane in XCode Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCQvg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer62911> Xcode actually has SVN bundled in its .app directory. Its available at code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svn/code (If you put Xcode.app in your Applications folder). You can add this path to your PATH, then access codesvn/code directly again.   If you need other Xcode command line tools (like gcc without installing Xcode), you can actually install them without installing Xcode first by going to Downloads for Apple Developers, and download and install the Xcode Command Line Tools.  <comment72620> Hmmm... there are no components available to install in my Prefs-Downloads area of XCode. <comment72622> Ah... indeed it is!  Thanks.  Also for the useful link.
