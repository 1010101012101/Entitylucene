How to sync home folders with Dropbox/Onedrive/Google Drive? <body> For some reason, I'd like to sync my home folders (that is code~/code) with sync tools such as Dropbox/Onedrive/Google Drive.  However, making a symbolism link is not working. Then I found some apps while none of them actually works..  So what's the best practices here? Thanks :)  <answer238753> I sync some emsmall/em local folders using Dropbox (Google Drive seems more reluctant to this sort of thing, I have no experience using OneDrive).  To do this, codeln -s /path/to/file /path/to/link/code in Terminal works for me, no problem.  strongDisclaimers/strong  ul liThis solution is Mac (possibly *nix)-specific, see here./li liThis is not officially supported by Dropbox./li liYour home directory contains lots of config files I would be wary of sending via network connection at all./li liAll the services you have listed have 'free' and 'premium' versions. I won't enumerate these here, but be aware of file and upload/bandwidth restrictions which will likely cause problems with this approach./li /ul  <comment292842> I symlink some folders into the ~/Dropbox folder and it generally works no problem. Note there are size restrictions on the free version of all those services which may be causing problems. <comment292845> @agentroadkill I've tried but nothing changed, you mean you put a symbolism link in dropbox? <comment292848> I'll create a more complete answer. <comment292856> As an addendum, Dropbox recommends putting a file in the ~/Dropbox folder, then symlinking that back **out** to your local filesystem. <comment292857> Also there are directories e.g. ~/Library/Caches which should not be shared  as some things will differ by machine especially also ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost.  Unfortunately OSX is not like Windows which has a clear difference between local and user data <comment292858> You can\t do all od ~ - are their some particular you want shared? <comment292859> Have you considered using [Synching](https://www.syncthing.net)?  This would be easy to setup.  I would actually be hesitant to sync my entire home folder though. <comment292860> @Mark, agreed, but I think the attempt is to link ~ to ~/Dropbox, so the machines won't have problems, other than constantly fighting to update the cache, prefs and other specific files. <comment292864> Thanks, I've been thinking that "Make Alias" is the equivalent to `ln -s`, and just now I found it's completely the different things..Thanks for your answer! <comment322415> Unfortunately This does not work in OneDrive.
