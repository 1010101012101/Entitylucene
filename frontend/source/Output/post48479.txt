How do I connect a VGA input to my Mac? <body> I am emnot/em talking about connecting a VGA monitor to a Mac. I'm referring to plugging in a VGA output in to my Mac. I want the VGA to show up as a video device, so that I can run a projector's feed through UStream.   What hardware is needed to digitize a VGA input in real time to send for broadcast?  <answer48480> You need a product like this:  KVM Console to USB 2.0 Portable Laptop Crash Cart Adapter  However I don't know if that will show up as a streamable device (or if it's even compatible with Mac). There are also people who have had success buying a webcam and a VGA  Analogue adapter, and wiring the analogue adapter into the webcams electronics to get it back into the computer.  Unfortunately, no real "easy" solution exists.  <answer106138> I use a product from http://xlr8.com/ to give me a video input on my mac, then use a VGA-to-TV adapter to stream powerpoint over ustream.  Video is really choppy and crappy looking, but for simple non-moving slides, it's OK for ustream.   <comment58066> Does the UStream software give you a clue as to what hardware you need? It looks like you'd just need [UStream Producer Pro](http://www.ustream.tv/producer) and any capture card that fits your budget. <comment65367> Seems like this is what I was looking for. However, I actually ended up using [Ustream Desktop Presenter](http://www.ustream.tv/producer) to send the projector to the computer. Thanks for your answer though!
