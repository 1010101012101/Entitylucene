Install OS X recovery mode. Can't log in <body> Dusting off an old iMac and it was hanging at 50% progress bar during start up.  Since I don't need anything on it I'm trying to reformat.    I've booted into recovery mode and erased the drive.  Then selected to install new OS.  Chose the drive (it's also showing a locked recovery drive).  By then it asks me to log into Apple Store.  I do and it's saying wrong password.  But then my phone asks for permission for login with my account.  I approve and it still doesn't let me in on the iMac.  Phone is giving an auth code but no where to enter it on iMac.    <answer280810> The version of the operating system of the recovery partition is probably lower than 10.11.0.  According to Apple you have to append the auth code to the password then:     What if I use two-factor authentication on a device running older software?   If you use two-factor authentication with devices running older OS versions, you might be asked to add your six-digit verification code to the end of your password when signing in. Get your verification code from a trusted device running iOS 9 and later or OS X El Capitan and later, or have it sent to your trusted phone number. Then type your password followed by the six-digit verification code directly into the password field.   <comment353203> Perfect.  That works.  Thanks a lot.
