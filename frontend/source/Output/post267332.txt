Is it possible to send all traffic of ONLY specified App(s) to SOCKS proxy? <body> I can easily send all of my traffic to a SOCKS proxy:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FK8ha.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I apply this setting to ONLY a specified group of Apps?  Thanks!  <comment335417> Google is your friend, I would say the answer is yes, but I don't have the time to actually research it for you.
