Verbose Mode is dropped on macOS Sierra? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jRYwC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q2OnS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hi guys,  Anyone know if Apple removed Verbose Mode in macOS Sierra or not? When It seems Verbose Mode couldn't be accessed any more.  One more thing, it also doesn't work with booting into Single-user Mode, Safe Mode or Verbose Mode via command line.  Any reply would be appreciated. Thanks.  Best Regards, Vincent  <answer255498> System Integrity Protection (SIP) disables changes to NVRAM. In order to make changes, you need to temporarily disable SIP by doing the following:  ol liBoot into Recovery Mode. (Hold kbdCommand/kbd-kbdR/kbd from the time you start your machine until the Apple logo appears.)/li liOpen the Terminal from the Utilities menu./li liEnter the command:  precodecsrutil disable /code/pre/li liReboot and you will be able to run your desired commands from within a normal session./li liIt's emstrongly/em recommended that you re-enable SIP when you're done making adjustments. To do so, run this command:  precodecsrutil enable /code/pre/li /ol  Note that if you intend to make a lot of changes to NVRAM, you can leave SIP enabled but disable NVRAM protection by running the following command from the Recovery Mode Terminal:  precodecsrutil enable --without nvram /code/pre  Again, you will need to reboot for changes to be effective.  <answer269305> As best I can tell in Sierra, it is still possible to:  codesudo nvram boot-args="-v"/code without disabling SIP.  However, the interesting thing is that while Vervose mode works at boot as it always has, it no longer displays anything at shutdown.  <comment318210> Hi @tubedogg, thanks for your promoting response. Really appreciated. But I don't think so. Even with SIP enabled in OS X El Capitan, I could boot t into Safe Mode or Single-user Mode with command line. Here is the screenshot for your reference. <comment318212> Just because something worked in El Capitan doesn't mean it hasn't changed in Sierra. And NVRAM modification shouldn't have worked in El Capitan, either. In any event, did you test disabling SIP, or at least disabling NVRAM protection? That's a sure way to find out. <comment318226> Yes, you are definitely right. Disabling SIP or NVRAM protection works well for command line. I take my words back. Thank you very much. Have a nice weekend.
