How do I remove a ColorSync profile from a JPEG image from Terminal in El Capitan? <body> I have several images that I would like to strip the ColorSync profile from. Eventually, I would like to automate this in bash so I could easily process this on a file or folder from the contextual menu using an Automator service.  How do I strip a color profile from an image file using Terminal?  <answer235934> Use codesips/code (scriptable image processing system) to remove an ICC color profile from an image file in El Capitan. codesips/code does a ton of other stuff as well.  To remove the ColorSync ICC profile from an image:  precodesips -d profile --deleteColorManagementProperties &lt;imagefile&gt; /code/pre  Example:  precodeMyFILE="${HOME}/Pictures/RemoveMyColorSyncProfile.jpg"; sips -d profile --deleteColorManagementProperties ${FILE}; /code/pre  It appears to support the following image types, but I'm basing this on the codeformat/code image property key (see Options in the man page):  ul lijpeg/li litiff/li lipng/li ligif/li lijp2/li lipict/li libmp/li liqtif/li lipsd/li lisgi/li litga/li /ul  See the man page for more info, or use codesips -h/code for help to stdout.
