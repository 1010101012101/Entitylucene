I want to keep the background of my terminal in RGB 484848 ... but it changes to white and then silver and then bluish after each restart  I don't know what did i do.   <answer228780> I suspect that you are using the profile named codeSolid Colors/code in Terminal.  Each time the terminal opens, it cycles to a random background within code/Library/Desktop\ Pictures/Solid\ Colors//code folder.  If you press Command-i, the inspector will open and you can change the settings of your current window.  Try clicking to "Pro" and then back to "Solid Colors" a few times.  You should get different a effect from Solid Colors nearly every time you come back to it.  I believe that you will have to make a new settings profile with the background color you want and then set that profile as the default.  <comment279026> how can i make that setting profile
