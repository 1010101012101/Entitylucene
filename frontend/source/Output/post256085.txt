How to view a workout on iPhone? <body> If I play a game of squash on the Apple Watch I record it as "Other Workout". Once finished the Activity app on the iPhone shows basic information like time, average heart rate, etc.  Is there a way I can see a visual breakdown of that workout? Such as my minute-by-minute heart rate on a graph like Fitbit does?  I can find the specific data in the health app but it's a pain and hard to visualise.
