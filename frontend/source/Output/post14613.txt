How do I split a video every X minutes? <body> How can I split a video every X minutes using iMovie or some other Mac software, outputting the split videos to a folder, named by section (e.g. "video1of4", "video2of4")?  <answer14618> QuickTime Pro does a great job using the Trim feature. It's intuitive too.  <answer14627> VLC has an "Exporting Wizard" that will let you subset. VLC also has a CLI interface so you should be able to automate it.  <answer18207> I used to do splits using ffmpeg on Fedora . I don't have the exact command handy though.   You could install ffmpeg and mplayer tools on OS X .   <answer110674> h2Split a video with VLC from the command line/h2  Open Terminal and run the following script:  It determines the length of the original file and splits it into 2 min intervals.   You can change this by changing the code$interval/code variable, which is in seconds.  You will also need to change the code$filename/code variable to whatever file you want to split.  precode#!/bin/bash filename=test.mkv duration=`ffprobe -show_format $filename | sed -n '/duration/s/.*=//p'` duration=${duration/.*} interval=120 start=0 n=$start stop=$interval while [ $duration -ge 0 ]; do     /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -Idummy $filename --start-time $start --stop-time $stop --sout=#file{dst=$n-out-$filename} vlc://quit     let start=stop     let stop=stop+interval     let duration=duration-interval     echo "Number of seconds left to process: $duration"     let n=n+1 done /code/pre  <answer110706> You can also use -f segment with ffmpeg:  precodeffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -f segment -segment_time 300 -reset_timestamps 1 %03d.mp4 /code/pre  code-c copy/code disables re-encoding video and audio, like code-vcodec copy -acodec copy/code. code-reset_timestamps 1/code makes each segment start with a near-zero timestamp.  <comment19846> More content, such as actual instructions of the GUI and/or CLI interface, would be grand. <comment130339> This script has been tested with vlc 1.1.3 and 2.2.1
