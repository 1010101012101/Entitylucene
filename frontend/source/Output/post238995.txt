Recover deleted Notes on iOS <body> I deleted a note accidentally.  I found it in my deleted notes.  It will stay there for 30 days and then delete forever it says.  How do I get it saved back into Notes from Deleted Notes?  <answer238998> Swipe it left.  You get 2 options, Move &amp; Delete.  Move allows to to move it back to where it came from, or anywhere else.br [Delete is permanent from that folder, so be careful]
