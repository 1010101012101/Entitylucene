How to Eject All External Partitions Quickly? <body> I have an external disk with two partitions on it that I keep plugged into my MacBook Pro when I'm at my desk. (One is for Time Machine, the other just for extra storage.) Sometimes I need to grab my laptop quickly and take it somewhere, but I have to change to a space where I can see the partitions on the desktop, lasso them, two-finger click, and select codeEject/code. Is there a faster way under Mavericks, or do I have to set up an AppleScript like this one with a keyboard shortcut?  Note: I'm emnot/em looking to eject these only when I put my Mac to sleep (as explored here). Sometimes I'm on a screen-sharing telecon and I have to take my Mac away from my desk for a minute, if you know what I mean :-).  <answer143423> if you happen to have the same setup everytime you want to eject several external disks at once, you could use AppleScript / Automater and make your own keyboard shortcut. There is a detailled description how to do this over here: https://superuser.com/questions/405330/global-keyboard-shortcut-to-eject-external-hard-drive-on-mac-osx-lion  <answer143424> I use launchbar to automate this task. It has a command shortcut to Eject All Ejectable Volumes. It's incredibly fast and if you turn off most of the indexing rules, the memory footprint and CPU usage can be tiny.  It's much more powerful than this one trick, but it does do that trick very well and you'd probably be fine using the free version for that purpose since you'd only be using that one shortcut.  <answer143426> You can use the menu bar app Ejector http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/12216/ejector to eject all ejectable volumes. The only regrettable part for me is that I can't eject them without logging in.  <answer143427> The only caveat to "quickly ejecting" disks with any reliability is that they will not eject if there are files in use which reside on them. That said, you can emforce eject/em disks, but that would not be ideal if files are, in fact, in use.  Easiest way to instantly eject all disks is by invoking an Applescript (could also create a shell script, but Applescript is more easily turned into a one-click application solution).   So go to your Applescript Editor, paste in the following:  precodetell application "Finder" to eject (every disk whose ejectable is true and local volume is true and free space is not equal to 0) /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tajXK.png" alt="Enter Code in your Script Editor"  and save the script as an application wherever you choose em(do NOT use the code/tmp/code folder as illustrated)/em. Add the resulting application to your Dock, and you have a one-click Quick Eject.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KCtl7.png" alt="Select &#39;Application&#39; as your file format"  emNote: the codeand free space is not equal to 0/code portion is so that the script doesn't eject the contents of your CD/DVD drive. Remove that if you would like any inserted disks ejected as well./em  <answer143463> On OS-X Mountain-Lion, I can option-click one of the "Eject" icons (hold down option, then click the eject icon), and all external partitions will eject.  em(Update)/em This has been verified to also work on OS X Mavericks and even on macOS Sierra, as I suspected it would.  It can probably be assumed to work on at least all versions in between (try it out!).  <answer144602> I'd recommend Alfred. It's a quick launching app that includes the feature of ejecting volumes. You can select what kind of targets qualify for the command (network drive, local, etc.).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m0JaC.jpg" alt="alfred eject command"  When you trigger the shortut, you can select a specific volume to unmount. Or you can type ejectall (this shortcut name is customizable).   <answer215447> Personally, I'm using Alfred as suggested in another answer. But here's the Applescript answer, wrapped up in a Ruby script.   precode#!/usr/bin/env ruby #eject-all shell script  # Dan Rosenstark 2015-11-12 15:28 # http://porkrind.org/missives/calling-applescript-from-ruby/ def osascript(script)   system 'osascript', *script.split(/\n/).map { |line| ['-e', line] }.flatten end  if __FILE__ == $0   appleScript = "tell application \"Finder\" to eject (every disk whose ejectable is true and local volume is true and free space is not equal to 0)";   osascript appleScript   puts "I probably ejected all the disks." end /code/pre  you'll have to put it in your path and make it executable.  <answer237807> This can be done elegantly with an automator application and using the Display Notification feature for output. Simply save the following as an application and launch it however you prefer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wjhxI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer278516> I use a combination of AppleScript and an application called Spark. Spark is on Github for Homebrew Casks.  precodebrew install Caskroom/cask/spark /code/pre  Then I just use an AppleScript to eject the drives and bind it to the shortcut kbdâŒ˜ E/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/somQR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment168889> I use [Alfred.app](http://alfredapp.com) to do this task. It makes it as easy as pressing `kbdcmd/kbd+kbdspace/kbd` and typing `eject`. Highly recommended <comment169030> This still works under Mavericks. <comment169031> Lots of good answers below. I'm having a tough time choosing one as the best. <comment182843> This turns out to be the most satisfying answer for me. One quick key chord and it's done. No extra software needed. Thanks! <comment260248> I've wrapped this in a Ruby script in my answer here... sort of the same thing over again... <comment279975> Seems not to work anymore on El Capitan. Can anyone confirm? <comment283435> Still works for me! <comment347291> I've put this Applescript to execute in a service and then created a keyboard shortcut in the System Preferences and it works perfectly.
