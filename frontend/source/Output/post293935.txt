Why can't my macbook connect to Wifi <body> When I run Network Diagnostics, under my network status:  Wi-Fi: green circle  Wi-Fi Settings: green circle  Network Settings: green circle  ISP: green circle  Internet: red circle (Failed)  Server: red circle (Failed)  I'm trying to connect to the internet but I'm unable to. I even tried using a hotspot from my phone because I have unlimited data. I have a MacBook Pro 13-inch, Late 2011  My OS is OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.5  Because I'm unable to connect even with a hotspot, I think something is wrong with my computer. Other devices in my house are able to connect to the internet.     <comment370965> Which model Mac computer is it? Have you tried running Apple Hardware Test on it yet? <comment370966> MacBook Pro 13-inch Late 2011. I haven't done a hardware test, how can I do that? <comment370967> See [this link](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257). Note that if holding “D” doesn’t work, try option+d to boot into internet diagnostics
