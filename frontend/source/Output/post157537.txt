Disable window snapping to top on move to second monitor/display <body> This annoying behavior started happening in 10.8 or 10.9 and I'd like to turn it off and make it never ever happen again.  What happens is that when dragging a window from one display to another, when I let go of the mouse button on the second monitor, the window doesn't stay where I left it upon mouse button release, but instead it snaps to the top of the screen where I did not position it.  Does anyone have any idea how to disable this annoying setting?  Thanks in advance.  <comment185228> This is not happening to me (I'm on Yosemite, but I remember it worked OK on earlier versions too). Maybe You have some kind of 3rd party software for window managment? <comment185233> No 3rd party window management.  Can't switch to Yosemite and IMO, it's really really ugly and would prefer not to.  My windows that are being moved are being moved to/from a Thunderbolt display onto or off of a 15" retina display.  It may only happen with windows that are larger than the display they are being moved on to.  Just tested in Safari and it sucks. <comment185237> read this post for possible solutions http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/9659/46541
