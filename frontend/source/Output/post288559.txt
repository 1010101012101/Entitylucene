Can I downgrade from iOS 11 developer beta? I'm not worried about data preservation <body> strongI simply want to get rid of this buggy beta./strong  I regretfully installed the beta on my dailydrive/main device.  I'm aware that I may not be able to preserve all of my data because I didn't make any backups whatsoever, therefore I've performed manual backups of my most precious files.  I just want to go from iOS 11 Beta 2 to a clean and completely-reset latest-version of iOS 10.  I have the developer beta if that makes a difference.  <answer288560> Yes!

I did this last year but have since completely forgotten how.  You jogged my memory and this sounds about right, so I went ahead and accepted this answer before doing it as I can't do it right away.  Thank you, again! <comment364392> I would be wary of immediately accepting an answer without testing it - especially in this case as one of the linked answers specifically says this is not possible in one step. <comment364411> I just said I've used this method before, it had just completely slipped my mind.  Therefore, I knew it would work.  I just finished and it worked, as I, from experience, *knew* it would.  Try it for yourself? <comment364412> I do appreciate the point you're making, though.  No matter how "sure" I was I shouldn't accept an answer w/out verifying its effectiveness.  I'll take your concern under advisement in the future.  Good thing it actually worked this time, though, right? ;) <comment364415> Guys I downgraded my own device following the same method before posting an answer here. So its completely safe to follow these steps. Peace :)
