Browser issues - gets redirected to adware <body> When I open web pages, the page automatically redirects to "youradexchange.com" or some other ad web site. Not been able to resolve the issue.  <answer187626> Does this happen on all websites?  Some sites do this. For example, The Pirate Bay or EZTV - when you click to scroll, they will open a new tab to show you ads.  <answer232529> I suggest to download and run Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware for Mac. It will detect most adwares and remove them automatically.  Also, see this article from Apple's Knowledge base about how to remove adware.  <comment221825> happens this on your ipad? Can you add that in the question?
