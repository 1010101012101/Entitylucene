RMBP 2013 and forcing windowed games in Low Resolution Mode <body> Is it possible to launch a program without an associated code.app/code bundle with the codeOpen in Low Resolution/code mode activated? I am talking about code~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/dota\ 2\ beta/dota_osx/code which is a codeMach-O executable i386/code  For that matter command-line codemplayer/code would also qualify.  <comment138978> Is the Low Resolution Mode checkbox on the Get Info pane greyed out? <comment138988> Only `.app` files have that option. For example, if you `Show Package Contents` within the `.app` and navigate to `Contents/MacOS/blah-blah` where `blah-blah` is the binary, you'll have no such checkbox in its info panel. <comment138999> I see what you mean - I'll have to have a play.
