This is my Old Mac i used to use and now i bought a Snow leopard installation disc and i want to add new RAM to my old mac.

You will need to remove the old RAM first unless there is an open slot available.  If you haven't already, you should most definitely follow procedures to minimize ESD to keep from damaging the RAM and other components inside.  <comment137015> I went on iFixit, gave my specs, added the RAM from the steps, and now im at the OS X Utilities. Thanks a lot :) <comment137016> Im now installing **Snow leopard** onto it, thanks for the help.
