HTML/rich text email signatures in iOS? <body> My work (Exchange) email signature has text formatting and a photo in it, as I'm sure many do. Does anyone know of a way to enable Apple Mail like signature customization in iOS?   My iPhone is jailbroken, so if you have a jailbreak solution that works I'm good with that.  <answer44002> There's a JailBreak Tweak called Mail Enhancer that does exactly what you want. It's $4.99 in the BigBoss repository, and there's another one called SIGnify for $1.50 in the ModMyi repo. They both allow you to have signatures with HTML formatting, but the more expensive one has many more features that make the Mail.app much more usable.  <answer112978> Here's an interesting workaround for getting rich-text signatures to cooperate in iOS' mail.app (without jailbreaking):  ol liSelect the rich text you want to use for your signature/li liPaste into empty signature field for account within Mail settings/li liShake to Undo and you should see "Undo Change Attributes" prompt/li liPasted text should now appear formatted as it was originally copied/li /ol  This works well in my testing within iOS7, however inline images still are not supported (they show within the signature field in settings but end up as attachments when emailed)  /via http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1522622
