Tips for using spotlight with webpages served via https <body> I've started using spotlight with webpages today.  It will actually index the strongcontent/strong of web pages in your history and bookmarks.  It's great.  But I can't find any documentation on how to use it.    My understanding is spotlight doesn't index URLs that start with https:  One of the main wikis that I use has all pages behind https:, so I would very much like to change this.    ul liIs there any way to get "mdfind" to spit out spotlight results for items other than files?  (UPDATE: Thanks bmike, I looked more carefully on my system, and I see the bookmarks now.)/li liAre there any other tips or tricks I should know for using spotlight better with https and/or normal web pages?/li /ul  <answer25615> I can't help you with the main thrust of how to index ssl content, but will take an attempt at the learning mdfind commands.  The man page for mdfind is thin, but shows you that you can search on emanything/em that is classified. In your case, try a mdfind command to get some web history results - for me, this command shows several files Safari has squirreled away for spotlight to index.  precodemdfind stackexchange | grep Safari | grep History | head /code/pre  From there, you can use codemdls/code to pick apart what terms you might want to feed back into codemdfind/code:  precodemac:Users mike$ mdls /Users/mike/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/History/http:%2F%2Fapple.stackexchange.com%2Fquestions%2F25487%2Flock-screen-with-launchbar.webhistory | tail kMDItemFSName                  = "http:%2F%2Fapple.stackexchange.com%2Fquestions%2F25487%2Flock-screen-with-launchbar.webhistory kMDItemFSNodeCount             = 14147 kMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 20 kMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501 kMDItemFSSize                  = 14147 kMDItemFSTypeCode              = "" kMDItemKind                    = "Safari history item" kMDItemLogicalSize             = 14147 kMDItemPhysicalSize            = 16384 kMDItemURL                     = "http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25487/lock-screen-with-launchbar" /code/pre  A few tags that might be of immediate use to you are strongkMDItemContentType/strong, strongkMDItemFSName/strong, and strongkMDItemURL/strong  You can see my mac has processed several hundred items with a URL that begins with https:  precodemac:Users mike$ mdfind "kMDItemURL == 'https:*'" | wc -l      353 /code/pre  <comment29022> It's my understanding that https is skipped for security reasons. Think about what could happen if spotlight started storing the content of your banking sessions, etc... <comment29359> That would be logical, but I'd really like a way to opt in for certain domains.  If anyone has a reference that says this an intentional implementation, I'll call it an RFE and close the issue.
