Sequential Omnifocus subproject marks all actions as "next actions" <body> I have a subproject (action group) in Omnifocus that is marked as sequential. When there is no due date on the top-level action (root action) of the subproject, the child actions are greyed out as they are supposed to be. See below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V72aW.png" alt="The correct implementation of the sequential subproject."  However, when I add a due date to the root action of the subproject, all of the child actions are listed as next action. See below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VEPKR.png" alt="The &quot;incorrect&quot; implementation of a sequential subproject."  This is annoying, as it's clouding up my forecast. Does anyone know if this is intended behavior, and if there's a way to change this?  <answer236916> In my understanding the strongroot action/strong (or strongaction group/strong) still is an action and if that action is due at a specific date &amp; time, all remaining sub-actions are due at latest at this date &amp; time.  Here is a discussion about these action groups, maybe it helps to understand the behaviour of them.
