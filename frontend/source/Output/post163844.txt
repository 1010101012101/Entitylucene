Icons not showing properly in Yosemite's Safari favourites bar <body> In this picture you can see that Safari recognises the correct icon for the bookmarks:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8RPUp.png" alt="Bookmarks"  However when I look at them as part of the drop down menu in the address bar a lot of the icons are missing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBtA8.png" alt="Bookmarks under address bar"  Is there a way to make the address bar refresh and load the proper icons or do I have to manually add the icons. And if so, how do I do it.  I use the address bar non-stop and it would be nice if it could do what it is supposed to do and look a bit more attractive.   <answer163845> These are two different icons:  ul lithe ones in the sidebar are emFavicons/em icons/li lithe one in the favourites are Apple specific (only shown by Safari) and called emWeb Clips/em (or Apple Touch Icons)/li /ul  They are both downloaded from the site but can be different.  For example IMDB specifies  ul lihttp://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/favicon-2165806970.emCB379387995/em.ico as Favicon and/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sUHJf.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul lihttp://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/mobile/apple-touch-icon-web-76x76-53536248.emCB361295462/em.png as Web Clip/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NgXND.png" alt="enter image description here"  From the comments: you can add a clip following these instructions:     To create a webclip, go to the site you want and tap the box-and-arrow icon used to create bookmarks. In the menu that pops up, tap the Add to Home Screen option. Edit the name of the webclip and tap Add. You'll then be taken to your home screen and shown the webclip. Tap it to go to that site.   <answer187259> No, Apple Touch Icons are uploaded alongside the HTML files on the website, usually in the root folder. Safari just pulls them from here if they exist. It is up to the site owner to add them.  <answer210838> Try and clear the icon cache.
