Apple TV 3 drops ethernet connection on 2 seconds <body> I have a problem with ethernet connection on my ATV3. It started about one month ago. ATV randomly drops ethernet connection for a two seconds. Here is the screenshot from my router:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KoSAX.png" alt="ATV connection screenshot"  ol liI'm already check the router interfaces and cable, other devices working fine without any problems./li liI have enabled autoupdate on ATV and the latest firmware installed./li liAlso I tried to downgrade the speed/duplex on interface to 10 megabits half-duplex./li /ol  Is there any recommendations or solutions?  <answer204311> I had problems with my ATV3 similar to yours. Went away after I've setup the ATV to take a manually assigned IP, and reserved that IP on the router (Time Capsule) for this ATV (by Mac address).  Problem gone ever since.  <comment201339> Did your issue coincide with a firmware update (possibly the 7.0.2 version)? We've had a handful of Apple TVs that have exhibited issues with Ethernet connections since this update. Restoring the unit through iTunes is the only way we've found to restore normal function. <comment227280> I'm tried to restore it. It works normally until first sleep. When it wake up after the behaviour still the same.
