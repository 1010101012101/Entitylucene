Print PDF with crop marks <body> I have an A4 PDF document that has strongcontent all the way to the border/strong and I want to print it out.  Hence I print out on A3 sized paper (i.e. I print on paper twice the size) and then cut it to the actual size.  Is there an easy way to strongadd crop marks to the document when printing it/strong?  <answer22762> If you have Adobe Acrobat Pro, this is easily done: File  Print  Advanced  Marks and Bleeds  Trim Marks  This may also be possible under Acrobat Reader, if someone would care to test it.  <answer67173> I have not found any way to do it on the strongfree/strong version. I was hoping there was, so that Sales would not have to come back to Prepress all the time to have us print out a proof with marks, but I'm not finding any way for them to do it in the free version (i.e. Acrobat Reader).  <answer275950> If it’s a simple PDF document, you could possibly open it with Inkscape and then add crop marks with codeExtensions &gt; Render &gt; Printing Marks…/code. Or maybe Scribus, with codePrint… &gt; Marks/code.   Very hacky but might help somebody in a tight corner.  <comment25397> Thanks. And it is not available with the free Acrobat Reader.
