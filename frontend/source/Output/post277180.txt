right to left paragraph shortcut is gone <body> I used to switch the paragraph settings from left-to-right and vice versa by using the combination: command-control-right_arrow (or left arrow) depend on the direction. But now that I'm trying to use it, it doesn't work anymore. I looked at the settings of the keyboard shortcuts and didn't find it anywhere there. I guess I didn't use it for a while, I don't know what happened that it doesn't work now.
