Where are Anaconda's libraries for PYTHONPATH? <body> I installed Anaconda's graphical installer successfully. I configured it to Python 3.5 by   precodeconda create -n py35 python=3.5 source activate py35 % to deactive source deactivate conda install notebook ipykernel ipython kernel install --user /code/pre  h2With PYTHONPATH/h2  I want to get Anaconda's libraries in PYTHONPATH.  They are not located in code$HOME/.anaconda/lib/python3.5/site-packages/code.  Here is a similar thread without an answer about emPYTHONPATH problems in OSX/em.  I run by accident codepip install conda/code just to test if you can confuse the system by installing second Anaconda, but you cannot and you get  precodeRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): conda in /Users/masi/anaconda/lib/python3.5/site-packages /code/pre  where you apparently see the location of the libraries of Anaconda.  My code$HOME/.bash_profile/code   precodeexport PYTHONPATH=/Users/masi/anaconda/lib/python3.5/site-packages  # otherwise PYTHONPATH fails in OS X; see history for logs export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 /code/pre  I run my test code   precodeimport numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline /code/pre  and I get unsuccessfully  precode/Users/masi/anaconda/lib/python3.5/site-packages/matplotlib/font_manager.py:273: UserWarning: Matplotlib is building the font cache using fc-list. This may take a moment.   warnings.warn('Matplotlib is building the font cache using fc-list. This may take a moment.') /code/pre  I do not know where Matplotlib keeps its cache. In Linux, removal with coderm -rf ~/.cache/matplotlib/code would be possible but not in OS X.  This can be a bug in Matplotlib that has not been solved in OS X. I sent a message to the thread about the issue in the project's Github here. The cache directory is empty, codels -a $HOME/.matplotlib//code gives empty list where you find the cache directory by codeimport matplotlib; matplotlib.get_cachedir()/code in ipython.   h2Without PYTHONPATH/h2  My PATH is  precode/Users/masi/anaconda/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin /code/pre  I install numpy by codesudo -H pip install numpy/code. I run the test code but I get  precode--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-1-a38059fd5ca4&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() ----&gt; 1 import numpy as np       2 import pandas as pd       3 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt       4 get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')  ImportError: No module named 'numpy' /code/pre  so something wrong with pip in installing the modules.  I have both codeconda/code via codepip/code and Anaconda.  This may not be optimal. Please, propose different setting.   h2Trying to get rid of conda/h2  I run codepip uninstall conda/code but I still get the error about missing codenumpy/code although I installed it with codepip/code. I think have some PATH problem. How can you uninstall all packages installed by conda?  hr  How can you add Anaconda's Python Libraries in PYTHONPATH?  <answer265116> I think one good option is to gave up with Anaconda and use codeCanopy/code under an academic license (user2738815).  Another option is to use Debian Linux, where I have not experienced any such problems.    <comment294729> probably bestt to run without any PYTHONPATH the anaconda setup should just work. Run in a virtual path by using conda activate <comment294736> What is your path and do you have both condo via pip and anaconda? <comment294749> I get different errors :( I had to install more than you e.g. condo install matplotlib. Time to get a real VM I think <comment294750> @Mark I installed matplotlib by `sudo -H pip install matplotlib`. I am trying to get rid of `conda`. Please, see the body. <comment294752> Using sudo etc will mess things up as that is not using anaconda - only use one package manager <comment294757> I would use condo install rather than pip conda http://conda.pydata.org/docs/_downloads/conda-pip-virtualenv-translator.html <comment294758> Excellent table! What should I do now? Not use `pip`? Use anaconda or conda? Uninstall `pip`-installed packages? <comment294780> I have a problem with mkl so cannot provide a working solution <comment294782> What is mkl? Can you open a thread about it so we can look at it?
