Error when trying to connect new iPhone 6s to MacBook <body>    iTunes could not connect to the iPhone "iPhone (2)" because an invalid response was received from the device.   <comment330701> If it's a brand new iphone, with no data on it, you can hardly do any damage by doing a [hard reset](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201559). Who knows, maybe it will help? There is, of course, also a slight possibility that the cable is bad. You might try a different one, if you have one. <comment330734> This error often means there's a communication problem between the MB and the iPhone.  Try using different cables or a different computer and see if the error persists.  Make sure you're not using a USB hub or anything in-between the iPhone and the computer.
