Wine on Mac via Homebrew <body> I installed a Windows application on my Mac after successfully installing Wine via Homebrew. The application runs and seems to function correctly except that all of my data is missing. I get the following error when i run it:  precodeWine cannot find the ncurses library (libncurses.5.4.dylib). /code/pre  I tried installing the following ncurses formula to no avail. Am i missing something?  <answer112261> I decided to install Wine from here and everything is now working when using this version of Wine. A little easier than setting it up myself.  <comment131755> What do you mean by "all of my data is missing"? <comment131764> @echristopherson The program doesn't get installed. It's just an executable. On my Windows machine i run the program and see all my data loaded in from the dat files. When i run the program via wine none of the data is there almost as if it were my first time running it.
