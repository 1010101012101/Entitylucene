How to disable macbook's mic, but not speakers? <body> I found this informative post about completely disabling audio on OS X by removing/disabling the required audio kernel extensions. The problem is this disables audio-in emand/em audio-out, and I only want to disable audio-in.  I'm looking to completely disable audio-in, in a way which cannot be re-enabled by unprivileged users, not just muting it. How could I accomplish this?  <answer124491> h2Disabling Input/h2  To disable the input, I'm not entirely sure.  Here's what I thought of:  ul liYou can use a internal audio input device like SoundFlower, which basically routes the audio output into the audio input./li liYou can mute the volume (although you said you don't want to do only that)/li liYou could take a look around the code/System/Library/Extensions//code folder and in the codeIOAudioFamily.ktexts/code file for anything useful, however that can muck up OS X./li /ul  h2Preventing Changes/h2  Disabling underprivileged users from changing the settings isn't actually too hard:  precode$ sudo chmod 700 /System.Library/PreferencePanes/Sound.prefPane /code/pre  Will do the trick.  Loading the preference pane from any user (other than root) will display an error.  <answer124495> I believe you can just adjust the input volume to the lowest setting (it is a slider within system preferences = sound = input). Move it to the far left and leave the rest the same.   Be sure and select the correct device for sound input when making your adjustments.   <answer168524> Insert a Minijack (headphones) in the Macbook's minijack input, option click on the Volume item in the Menu Bar and select use Audio Port for input:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yJIMS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer205641> chmod 700 still allows the current user to change sound prefs, chmod 000 would allow only root to change prefs.  precode$ sudo chmod 000 /System.Library/PreferencePanes/Sound.prefPane /code/pre  <comment145638> That isn't what OP is looking for, "... not just muting it".  He wants to actually disable the input device entirely. <comment146768> correct me if I'm wrong, but the `chmod 700` command only prevents settings-changes using the graphical interface. Surely there are other programmatic ways to change it.. <comment207307> Surely that can be undone by an unprivileged user... <comment248024> "surely"? Do you have an example of a non-privileged user changing a read-only file belonging to root? <comment248046> This also prevents me from changing the prefs of `audio-out`... <comment265577> @samh, no. What I meant is this only "locks" the GUI preference pane. Isn't there a way to enable/disable sound not using the GUI preference pane? Will changing the permissions on that file block that as well? <comment300224> So I'm guessing this is the expert advice: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/06/22/why-has-mark-zuckerberg-taped-over-the-webcam-and-microphone-on/
