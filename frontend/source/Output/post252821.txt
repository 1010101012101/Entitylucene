How to view per-app cellular data usage in iOS 10? <body> In iOS 9, under settings - Cellular, I can see how much cellular data each and every app has used.     But in iOS 10, it's no longer there. Has it been moved to somewhere else? Or removed at all from iOS 10?  Here is a screenshot of iOS 10. I've scrolled to the very bottom.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F0mkA.jpg" alt="ios10"  <answer252826> Hmm, should still work as before (screenshot from iOS10):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3s9fn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer252827> Found it.    Settings  cellular  apps using WLAN &amp; Cellular.br There were no numbers in there before(probably because I hit reset) so I missed it...    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zLt6u.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment314586> Mine's the same as before, too - might be another carrier-related setting.
