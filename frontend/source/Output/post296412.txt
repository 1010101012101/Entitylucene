How do you get Cmd Tab to cycle thru all windows of an application <body> Doing web dev I sometimes need 2 chrome windows, one normal, and one incognito.  It's pretty aggravating that Cmd-Tab only gives me one chrome icon to work with.  (The same can be said for iTerm2 windows)  I want Cmd-Tab to cycle thru windows, NOT applications.  If there are 2 iterm2 windows, then I want 2 iterm2 icons in the list I can Cmd-Tab thru.  Same for chrome.  How do I turn on this behavior in MacOS.  I'd also love it if Cmd-Tab automatically unminimized windows without doing a Option/arrow key dance.  I'd like my short cut keys to be a bit more helpful than they currently are.  3rd party "fixes" for this problem are acceptable. Binding keys to specific windows would possibly be acceptable if I only had to do it once or maybe once per reboot.
