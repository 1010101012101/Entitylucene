How to download iTunes song (via iTunes Match) using AppleScript <body> I'm trying to figure how to download the file for iTunes songs which are are not yet downloaded to my local machine (and reside in the iTunes Match Cloud) using AppleScript or any other library.  My goal is to have a script running locally on a cron that downloads any 5 star rated song. As I stream most of my music via iTunes Match, I want an automated way to download those high rated songs.  I looked around and figured something like this would work:  precodetell application "iTunes"     activate     set results to (every file track of playlist "Library" whose rating is 100)     repeat with t in results         download t     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Although it just blows up:  precodeerror "iTunes got an error: item 1 of   {file track id 86657 of library playlist id 61224 of source id 66, .... }    doesn’t understand the “download” message." /code/pre  Any help would be appreciated.  <answer276108> precodetell application "iTunes"   set matchedSongs to tracks of library playlist 1 whose rating is 100 and cloud status is matched   set uploadedSongs to tracks of library playlist 1 whose rating is 100 and cloud status is uploaded    set results to matchedSongs &amp; uploadedSongs    repeat with aTrack in results     if class of aTrack is shared track then       try         download aTrack       end try     end if   end repeat end tell /code/pre  This does the job!  I couldn't figure how to do a nested condition on the codewhose/code so I simply acquire both set of searches for matched and uploaded songs and combined them.  The codetry/code and codeif/code just ensure we download the valid tracks if they don't exist locally.
