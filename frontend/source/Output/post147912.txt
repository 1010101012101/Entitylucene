The video app on iPhone does not remember last watched position <body> Is there any way to make the video on iPhone remember the last watched position of a movie?  If I stop watching at like 59:03, I expect the app to open the movie at 59:03 the next time I open the movie in the app. Apple TV does it, or really asks if you want to pick up where you left, or start from the beginning.  <answer147924> Go to emSettings/em → emVideos/em and choose where to resume playback.  <comment174389> That is obvious, but how to auto-resume where left off ? <comment174390> @Buscar웃 It does that automatically? <comment174492> It's strange to hide this feature in settings... <comment347719> In 2017 I cannot find this setting
