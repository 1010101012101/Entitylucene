su returns `permission denied' <body> When I codesu admin/code, I get  precodeshell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent     directories: Permission denied  /code/pre  What is the correct/best way to give the user admin access to all directories? (Or is this somehow not good?)  <comment269103> Does the user `admin` have at least r-x permissions on the current directory and --x on all directories from the current up to `/`? <comment269105> No, but I think all belong to the groups staff or wheel. do admin users not also belong to these groups? <comment269108> The error message typically appears if the user can't access the current directory. To verify, try `cd / && su admin`. <comment269116> Could you edit this o elaborate on what OS version is in play. Even root can't have admin write access on many directories on 10.11. If you just want normal admin access, say that. If you need help with directory permissions ask that explicitly.
