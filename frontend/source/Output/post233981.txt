Open applications in the background in OS X, I don't want my focus taken from me. Respect my Focus! <body> I'm running El Capitan 10.11.4 on a 2014 Mac Mini.   I'm often running 10-14 apps at one time as I work writing reports, word/excel/Adobe/Safari/iTunes/calendar/etc...  Frequently I want to open another app, I want it to open in the background and go back to word/excel and keep working, but the launching app takes away my focus, sometimes 2 or 3 times. once for the splash screen, once for the open dialogue window, and again after I click 'new document'.   Another situation, I update an app in the background, like 1Password (beta) and every step it takes my focus back to the app being updated.  Is there anything I can do with Unix/Terminal, etc. to force all app activity to be done in the background, or to keep OS to respect my focus?  <comment343866> God I wish this could be resolved. I launch apps from spotlight and it always kills my work flow to have the app steal back my attention after 2-10 seconds of loading.
