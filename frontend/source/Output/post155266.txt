Safari "Search Tabs" Keyboard Shortcuts <body> The new "Search Tabs" feature of Safari 8 is pretty nice. When "show all tabs" is activated, you can type some text to filter the tabs to the one you want. However, once I have a single tab visible, it would be emvery/em nice to be able to activate that tab. This would allow "spotlight" type functionality for tabs.  However, it doesn't seem like there is a keyboard shortcut to activate the tab once I've searched for it, so I'm forced to click the tab with my mouse! This seems like an oversight, I can't believe Apple would add a nice way to filter the tabs, but no way to select one!

I spent all day looking for this. I use a great free app called BetterTouchTool( using OS X 10.10 ) to add aditional gestures and shortcuts to all apple devices, and it work instantaneously! No delay!  I will make screenshots with each step you need to configure. NOTE: It will bind the mouse position as a keyboard shortcut of your choice when you're using safari.  Downsides: You can't change safari's window position, and the position of the mouse will be different from the monitor from your notebook.  Solution: I recommend map the mouse position using it in fullscreen with the screen you most use most of the times( or just map two shortcuts for each screen )  ul li1  Download the app http://www.bettertouchtool.net/li li2 Open the app, select keyboard, add an app to list to the shortcuts you will add( in this case Safari ), choose your shortcut( I'm mapping "Option + 1" in this screenshot ), then, inside the Trigger select menu, select "strongMove Mouse to Position/strong" in the "Other Mouser Actions".strongI marked the wrong option in the screenshot, it's the option above. It's NOT "Save mouse position".  Sorry i'm too tired, it's 3 am and I have to work tomorrow/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1xbh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li li3  Choose where you want the cursor to go( The position in the input box will check the first result when the UI is showing ~3 results) /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mEkPH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ul li4  Add a following event: A left click event. And that's it! img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2RY1i.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  Do the same with a different mouse position to get the 2nd, 3rd.. result but keep in mind the ui will change if larger results, sometimes even hiding the first result.  <answer194895> I've been using Applescript to do this since before they added this feature:  http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/OSX/safari-tabs.html  It pops up a search dialog, you enter your search, and it immediately activates a single matching tab, or gives you a dialog to select from a list of matching tabs. It brings the window to front and makes this the active tab in the window.  (I have a similar script for finding Terminal windows.)  <answer277290> I am a bit late to the party, but I think Shortcat will perform the necessary functionality.   With the added bonus such that it can be used with Mail, etc.  <comment182642> I know this is completely unhelpful, but I can believe they would do that. :P Especially given how...rough some of the edges of Yosemite are in general. <comment187328> I'll mark this as "best answer" for now, since it's a pretty thorough treatment on the subject, and shows that it's pretty much impossible. Thank you. <comment217635> Anything new on that? It's been a few month and this problem still seems to persist :( <comment259100> Very cool; I think I'll try this. If I understand it, it looks like your script also searches all open windows, instead of just the current one. Is that correct? This is a feature I would like that the normal search doesn't have. <comment285935> I have remapped `shift+command+\ ` to `command+d`. So then you just do `command+d command+f `text here `command+d`.
