My Macbook keeps getting hung-up when signing into mail <body> This problem is relatively new. I am running Yosemite with all updates completed. Each day for the past week I get an (!) in a triangle near one or more of my mail accounts (gmail usually or any that follow in sequentially), and my computer won't connect to the server. When I hit the connection doctor, it shows two accounts for Gmail (I'm assuming, or else I have not clue what "Google" is for), even though I only have one. One says Google and one says Gmail.I don't have Chrome. See below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pn7vx.png" alt="enter image description here"  Its the Google one that gets hung up, but that impacts my ability to connect to Gmail despite saying login succeeded, and can also impact the ability of mail to move on to opening my Hotmail and iCloud accounts as well.  I deleted and readied the accounts, and still the Google appears despite having just one Gmail account and it gets hung up. I'm simply boggled.
