search for file extensions with ~ in finder <body> i ran a script to change a tiff image, now it created the new image but kept the original with the file extension ".tif~".  Is there any way to search for all of the files in Finder or in another way with the .tif~ extension to remove them all?  I tried searching for system files and including invisible files in the search.  <answer154525> ol liIn Finder hit kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd to open the Spotlight interface (without requiring a string to search for)./li liHit the search parameter dropdown (by default "Kind"), select Name./li liSelect 'matches' in next dropdown./li liType codetif~/code in the text box./li /ol  You could select codeKind â†’ Other/code and insert codetif~/code, but does not work that way.  Additionally,  you could search for it on the Terminal type the following in your home directory:  precodefind . -name "*.tif~" /code/pre  <comment181797> i tried Name, but that doesn't seem to work for me <comment181798> I updated my answer. The terminal command works, if don't is because you don't have any files with that extension. <comment181806> If you know the Folder select it first, if not select your hard drive to search all (.tiff)
