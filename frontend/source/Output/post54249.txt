I tried to install latest version of Libxml2 that is  libxml2-2.8.0  Because of incompatibility of this version Mac is throwing errors while opening XCode, Chrome and some other application with the error.  precodeDyld Error Message: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/AppKit Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:    /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture    /usr/local/lib/libxml2.2.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture    /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture /code/pre  What should I do ? How should I remove libxml2 2.8.0 version.?   Please reply  <answer54286> You can do either of  ol liremove code/usr/local/lib/libxml2.2.dylib/code, copy a working codelibxml2.2.dylib/code from another Mac with the same OS X version and recreate the symlinks to look like the directory listing below/li lireinstall OS X Lion on top of the existing installation and reapplying all the system updates./li liget codelibxml2.2.dylib/code from your backup and apply option 1/li /ol  PS: I managed to do the same thing with one of the more essential libraries a few months ago, leaving only option 2 (because nothing useful worked anymore). With hindsight I probably could have booted from DVD to apply option 1, but I would still have needed a trusted source for the library because the DVD was for 10.7.0.   hr  precodepse@Fourecks:~$ ll /usr/lib/libxml2.* lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       15 Feb 12 11:51 /usr/lib/libxml2.2.7.3.dylib@ -&gt; libxml2.2.dylib -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  2321840 May 10 20:34 /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib* lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       15 Feb 12 11:51 /usr/lib/libxml2.dylib@ -&gt; libxml2.2.dylib /code/pre  <comment62115> How did you install the newer version? Macports? Homebrew? Also, which version of Xcode do you have installed? And did you install the command line tools that are optional in the Xcode downloads section?  Knowing this will give us a little more insight on how to help you out. <comment62241> Thanks! Reinstalled Lion and worked :) <comment62242> Yes,libxml2 was installed using ./configure and make. The problem was that there was Python-2.7.3 dependency for it, which was ignored by me :( .Now I reinstalled Lion and fixed the problem
