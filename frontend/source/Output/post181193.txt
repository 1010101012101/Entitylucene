No website opening but network works perfect, dns perfect as well <body> I am relatively new to OSX but I do my best here. I read a lot and tried to solve but did not find a answer which fits to my problem well.  I have a Mac Mini with Yosemite 10.10.2. My network seems perfect and I can ping for example in my Terminal any website, domain etc. also nslookup works perfect for any domain.   How ever if I try to open a website nothing opens and the page loads simply forever. I am connected either with Wifi or Cable but the same result. I tried to activate/disactivate  without success the network adapter. Of course I restarted modem as well. (Besides with my tablet and phone the same modem via Wifi works perfect).  I dont know what else to do. I also do not use any Antivirus, Firewall etc. software in this moment. How ever something blocks me from opening any website. the only thing which helps me is a complete restart of my system.  Thank you  in advance for any tip.  <answer181195> Check to see if your time and date are set correctly. Safari will have all sorts of trouble including with certificates when the time is off.  <comment215479> Time and Date are perfect. Also problem happen with all Browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Safari. <comment215487> What happens if you just try an IP address in the address bar? For example http://17.172.224.47 should take you to Apple's website and http://2.127.237.152 should take you to Google. <comment215735> That is a good question, I did not try this. I only tried to ping addresses and domains from Command. Next time I am stuck I check this. Do you have already a tip in case it works or does not work?
