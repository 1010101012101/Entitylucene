Ridiculous cache usage on iPad <body> My iPad kept on running out of storage space, so I finally connected it to the computer and investigated.   This is the usage as shown in iTunes, where the "Other" section is 7.33 GB:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Z521.png" alt="enter image description here"  I then got the PhoneClean app to examine if there's any useless space being used:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tceoa.png" alt="enter image description here"  The bulk of the 6GB is "Download Temp", which appears to be full of update files, many of them repeated 5-6 times.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pq0W.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to figure out why this is happening / is this normal? Or did someone just forget to delete updates once they're applied..?
