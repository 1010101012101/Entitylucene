Apple Airport Time Capsule 3tb 802.11 ac blinking green and yellow really fast <body> my apple time capsule is not working, it started to blink green and yellow (amber) light 6 times in a second. It doesn't works as a router and i tried all the kinds of reset and it doesn't work. I bought it 13 months ago, and it has all my files in it. Im really worried and i can't understand why it isn't working. I looked for in internet and nobody has that problem.  Thanks for your help.   <comment313851> Does the device show up in AirPort Utility?
