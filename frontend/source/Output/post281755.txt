Remove files from MS Outlook <body> A couple months ago I thought I'd switch from Thunderbird to Outlook, I thought it would make sense seeing as I'd started paying for MS Office.  However it reminded me on just how bad Outlook is and I stopped using it a few days later.  Seeing as it downloaded a pretty hefty amount of emails (there didn't appear to be a way to limit the sync like in Thunderbird) I would like to remove any files it generated from my hard drive.  Does anyone know how I can do this? I imagine it is just a case of deleting the necessary file(s) folder(s)?  <answer281768> Try code~/Library/Group Containers//code, Microsoft office is wierd like that... it should be in a folder named something like codeUBF8T346G9.Office/code then inside code/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles//code to go straight there, try going to code~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles//code alternatively, run the following in terminal: coderm -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook//codeimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5neQK.png" alt="directory structure is as follows ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/"  <answer281769> I'm assuming you're using MS Outlook 2016. If so, the location of your data will be within your user's emLibrary/em folder.  To view this:  ul liGo to Finder/li liPress and hold the kbdoption/kbd key/li liClick on the Go menu and select the emLibrary/em option/li liYou can let go of the kbdoption/kbd key now/li liWithin the Library folder navigate to the Group Containers folder/li liWithin the Group Containers folder look for a folder starting with "UB" and ending with .office/li liOpen this folder and you will see the Outlook folder/li /ul  Within this folder are located any profiles you created - you can delete these as you wish.
