Cannot export private key from System.keychain with Keychain Access or command line <body> I'm trying to export a private key from System.keychain in Keychain Access. I've tried running Keychain Access as a root. No matter what, I always get the following error.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QVjgO.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I try to export the private key via the command line I get the following.  codesecurity: SecKeychainItemExport: The contents of this item cannot be retrieved./code  <answer253176> Most likely, your key was imported with code-x/code option for codesecurity import/code:   precode&lt;...&gt; -x      Specify that private keys are non-extractable after being imported. &lt;...&gt; /code/pre   When you try to export a key, Security Framework checks whether this attribute is set and refuses to export the key.  Of course, the key is still there and you might be able to find a way to extract it (see this question).
