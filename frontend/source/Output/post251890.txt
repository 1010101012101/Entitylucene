Set timezone and time on 2013 Airport Extreme <body> I have a 2013 Airport Extreme with firmware 7.7.7 and am using Airport Utility 6.3.6. I've searched through the menu options and don't see how to set the timezone and time for the router. This is of interest to me because I've found the time is off by an hour. I want to be able to set the timezone/time because of logging accuracies plus I'm nomadic and frequently change timezones.  Does anyone know how to set the timezone and time on this router without rolling back Airport Utility?
