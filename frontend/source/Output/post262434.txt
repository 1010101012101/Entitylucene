How to make OSX Skype misc sound FX honor system/prefs audio settings? <body> I'm on OSX Mavericks (2011 iMac), running the latest Skype 7.36 (507).  The audio device is set to use "Same as System", although changing it has not altered the results anyway.  The issue is that the sound effects (emnot calls or call-related sounds/em, just the misc FX noises) will only play through the iMac built-in audio, regardless of what I set the system to.  I have an external audio device (iConnectAudio4+) that I normally route my Mac audio through.  It works in every case except Skype's non-call-related sounds.  However I can even disconnect the external audio device and just route my system audio to emanything/em else (SoundFlower, an Airplay device, anything) and still, Skype's misc sound FX will always play out the iMac speaker.  Call related sounds always obey the system or preferences settings.  Any idea how to get all Skype sounds to obey the settings?
