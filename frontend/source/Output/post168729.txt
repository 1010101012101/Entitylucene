Screen Burn (Yosemite) <body> When moving some dock icons around, I noticed screen burn, basically my old dock icons were burnt into the screen, is there a way of fixing this issue? I'm running on a MacBook Pro and Yosemite. Is the burning the type of thing that's going to disappear after a while?  <answer168731> Something like this might help     Create an all-white screen in a graphics application such as   AppleWorks or Photoshop, and save it as a JPEG file.      Use this as the image displayed by the screen saver.      Turn the display brightness down (but not off) to preserve backlight   bulb life.   Leave the white screen saver on for a while.  or more simple, use the build in "Flurry" screen saver and let it run overnight.
