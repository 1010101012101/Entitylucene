External hard disk not mounting <body> I have a WD My Passport Ultra Hard Disk. I am trying to use it on El Capitan.  Its not showing up in the Finder.  When I open Disk Utility, it just keeps loading forever and does not show any information at all.  I tried rebooting the system, that didnt work.  Then I went to the Terminal. The disk is showing up there:  precodeAmits-MacBook-Pro:~ amit1235813$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1 2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2 3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +498.9 GB   disk1                              Logical Volume on disk0s2                              4BEE21E5-501F-4031-ADB7-FA32F0EB4C33                              Unencrypted /dev/disk2 (external, physical): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1 2:       Microsoft Basic Data SANGRAH                 2.0 TB     disk2s2 /code/pre  The disk name is 'Sangrah' - that means its connected but not mounted. So, I tried mounting it but it shows a time-out error:  precodeAmits-MacBook-Pro:~ amit1235813$ diskutil mount /dev/disk2s2 Volume on disk2s2 timed out waiting to mount /code/pre  It was working fine half an hour back and now its not. Could anybody please help? Thank you!  <comment330819> Try "sudo diskutil umount /dev/disk2" followed by "sudo diskutil mount /dev/disk2" (don't specify s2 partition). Also, is the format NTFS, FAT, or ExFAT? Please post results. <comment330835> Its weird, its mounting now without any issues. This happened last month too. In any case, I will be sure to try what you suggested the next time this issue occurs, which I am afraid it will.
