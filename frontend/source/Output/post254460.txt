xattr issue Sierra <body> I was trying to remove extended attributes (quarantine) in order to install Fusion. This is what I ran in terminal:  precodesudo xattr -rc /Volumes/VMware\ Fusion/VMware\ Fusion.app /code/pre  Apparently, the instruction was applied to code/Volumes/code instead of just the app. In consequence, lots of troubles appeared after a restart:   ul licharacters are not being displayed (only question marks inside a box)/li lipermissions or ownership of lots of folders and files were messed up/li lichaos/li /ul  I would like to know why this happened and if there's any way to revert it back to default. I tried to run codeRepairHomePermissions/code from recovery mode as describe here: macOS Sierra Recovery HD Changes but it didn't help. With a different system user everything works fine so I don't know if only the home folder was affected.   <answer254473> If you really entered the command as shown, the change should be local to codeVMware Fusion.app/code. But anyway, if you want to restore things back to sanity, you can  ul liredownload and reinstall macOS Sierra from the Store/li liboot into the Recovery Partition and reinstall from there/li /ul  <comment316812> To remove the quarantine attribute, it's better to use `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` and leave other extended attributes in place. <comment316813> That's what I will do but I was mainly looking for an explanation. Is xattr capable of that kind of destruction? It changed the ownership of home folders from user:staff to root:wheel <comment316814> No, it isn't. If you are looking at permission issues, `xattr` isn't the culprit.
