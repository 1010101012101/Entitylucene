Keyboard shortcut for powering down 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar? <body> I received my new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar today and quickly realized that the shortcut kbdctrl/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdcmd/kbd+kbdpower/kbd (documented here under 'Sleep, log out, and shut down shortcuts') no longer works for quitting all apps followed by shutting down.  Can this shortcut be reinstated or is it replaced by something similar?  <answer262839> Have you tried using TOUCH ID as a substitute for Power Button in the regular shortcuts?br I haven't got my hands on the new MBP but an article here says     ...and when you want to turn it off, you just hold down the Touch ID button found at the rightmost side of the Touch Bar.br   So technically, Touch ID is the power button.     However, according to iMore, TOUCH ID only offers following functionality:      The "Use Touch ID for" options include:br   Unlocking your Macbr   Apple Paybr   iTunes &amp; App Store   So ther is slightly less chance of Touch ID working as a power button.br You can let us know about it.br Another small workaround this situation can be using codeCMD+Shift+//code to open codeHelp/code menu firstbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3q5sc.png" alt="Help Menu"br And then using Direction keys (Up, Down, Left &amp; Right) to navigate to Apple Menu, from where you can easily codeSleep/code, codeRestart/code or codeShut Down/codebr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YWZ1H.png" alt="Apple Menu"  <answer262983> em"Have you tried using TOUCH ID as a substitute for Power Button in the regular shortcuts?"/em  holding down Touch ID will power off the computer, but it's a hard poweroff similar to holding down the power button on older machines for 5 seconds. I also can find no method for using the keyboard to initiate a normal shutdown. Bizarrely, the TouchBar has a sleep command that can be configured (see the bit about customize and expand here), but using modifier keys with the Touchbar sleep command like cmd or cmd-opt or cmd-opt-ctr will launch into the Energy Saver pane in System Preferences rather than sleep, restart or shut down..weird. Hopefully they'll add/fix this in a future software update. This is a BIG drawback for me as well in the new machine :(   <answer266641> Step 1:  System Preferences - Mission Control  Change "Show Desktop" to F10  Change "Show Dashboard" to F11  Step 2:  System Preferences - Keyboard  Click "App Shortcuts"  Click "+" symbol to add new  Leave Application as "All Applications"  Type in Menu Title exactly this phrase (without quotation marks): "Shut Down..."  Click cursor in the Keyboard shortcut field, then on keyboard hold "fn" key then select "F12" on touchbar  Result:  Holding "fn" key and selecting "F12" on touchbar will bring up the shutdown prompt.  Holding "fn" key and selecting "F10" will show desktop, holding "F11" will show dashboard.  Done.  <comment329286> '_Have you tried using TOUCH ID as a substitute for Power Button in the regular shortcuts?_' Yes, that was the first thing I tried. Unfortunately, it has no effect whatsoever. Of course, I can press and hold TouchID for a hard shutdown, but that's not what I want. I want macOS to close all applications first (and ask about unsaved changes, if any) before powering down. <comment357635> Out of curiosity I renamed the Menu Title "Shut Down" without the trailing ellipses. When I tried this "new" shortcut it immediately powered off the computer without any prompt. I can't view the Menu Title of the "Shut Down..." prompt though. Is there an advanced Mac OS tips and tricks resource I could peruse that goes more into detail regarding this kind of functionality? <comment357678> I did some more research and came across the [macOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH15-SW3) which explains when and why ellipses should be used.
