After highlighting text and hitting backspace, it re-highlights more text <body> So basically when I highlight a selection of text, say 10 characters, and hit backspace, it will delete the text. However, it will then highlight another 10 characters right after.  So if I highlight and delete 10 characters, and start typing, it will actually delete the next 10 characters for some strange reason.  Anyone know why this happens on Mac OS?
