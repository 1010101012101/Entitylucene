Photo app won't show location when pictures are taken <body> I am using ios 7.0.4 jailbreak on iPhone 5, and I noticed since 30th January, that when I take pictures, and I open Photo app, it won't show the location where my pictures were taken. More details: Location is on. Reset location and privacy settings didn't fix my issue. All the pictures taken before 30th January show location correctly. I googled it about my issue but I didn't find any related information, at all!  <comment142913> is that before or after jailbreak ? <comment143100> This is after jailbreak. But in addition to that, it was working for me after making jailbreak, but two weeks after suddenly it stopped showing location.
