Hide month in menu bar in OS X <body> On my MacBook Pro the date is shown like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2y4T.png" alt="Menu Bar"  I'd like to remove the word 'Chaitra' from the menu bar (Chaitra is a month of the Hindu calendar). How can I do that?  <answer127674> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongDate &amp; Time/strong → strongClock/strong and uncheck strongShow Date/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yGhgH.png" alt="Screenshot"  To change the language used, go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongLanguage &amp; Region/strong → strongAdvanced/strong and set strongFormat Language/strong to the language you want to use.  <answer127708> To change the format of the date, you want to go to your "Language and Text" settings. Click on the "Region" tab at the top, then go to the section under "Dates":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pMqky.png" alt="Dates section in Language and Texts settings"  Click on the "Customize..." button, then you should see a whole drag and drop section where you can change how the date is displayed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0V2Vf.png" alt="Customize Date"  <comment149578> brother i want date and time what i don't want is the word written over there that is chaitra thats change acoording to month. <comment149580> possible duplicate of [Set the date and time in menubar to be in a specific format](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66089/set-the-date-and-time-in-menubar-to-be-in-a-specific-format) <comment149583> but why its written like this in hindi or i don't know what language is this i want it in english that all. <comment149584> @user75758 I've edited my answer
