Early 2008 Mac Pro Random wake up and other oddities <body> When I first purchased the machine in 2008 it ran flawlessly under Tiger I believe was the OS at the time.  Ever since I upgraded to later iterations of OS X, my machine would randomly wake up from sleep but it's not a full on wake as the monitors don't turn on, just the audible click sound from the Mac and a few minutes later will go back to sleep again.  Happens 3-4 times through the night when I'm sleeping.    Secondly, when I wake it from sleep, my optical drive will no longer be available.  I have to do a full hard restart to gain that functionality again only to lose it again if my machine goes to sleep.  One last thing is when I initiate the sleep process, it takes a good 30 seconds before it actually goes idle.   Never had these issues with Tiger (could have been Leopard).     Thanks for any insights.   <answer163712> It's running Yosemite but the problem started when I first upgraded from Leopard.  According to specs I've found the computer first came with Lepoard in 2008, not Tiger as I previously stated.    <comment191713> What OS is it running now? <comment191723> Please don't use the answer section for comments. This should be a comment. <comment191724> Have you tried reinstalling the OS? <comment191755> Yes I have reinstalled the OS many times but it doesn't make a difference.
