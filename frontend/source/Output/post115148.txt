How to change audio output according to display state? <body> I've got a Mac Mini connected to a TV via HDMI. I would like to have the audio output device changed automatically to external speakers if the TV is turned off. I can imagine that this feature is not included in OS X so I aware that I need some kind of script.  I already found an AppleScript which changes the audio output device, so I would need some kind of detection mechanism which is triggered when the TV is turned off. Is there anything you can think of which would help me with this?
