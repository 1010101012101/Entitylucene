Trying to restore my iPhone 4 shortcuts, contacts, calendar events, and notes <body> I don't think I have iCloud or any backup, but I was able to restore some old notes when I re-added an email account that I'd been using for a while. Still can't get the other, more recent notes. In playing around with it, somehow all my keyboard shortcuts disappeared! My daughter tried to restore them by putting her account on briefly (she'd had it on there the whole time I've had the phone and just recently took it off) but that just synched it with hers. She deleted her account right away, but even with that account deleted my shortcuts and contacts are all hers.  Very frustrating!  <comment172132> Since you have no back up, where will it restore from? <comment172137> The notes appear from your email account as well. Open Notes  Accounts and check.
