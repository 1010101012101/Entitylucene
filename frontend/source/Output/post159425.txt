Can Grapher evaluate a function? <body> I just noticed that Grapher fails to evaluate a function at a constant.  In the image, the graph of y = c should of course be a horizontal line.  Is there a way to fix or work around it?  This seems like such a fundamental bug that I can't understand why I haven't run into it before.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0XUX.png" alt="Grapher screen shot"  <answer215088> Well, the problem is that Grapher assuming that the codex/code in codef(x)=x^2/code means the x coordinate.  To fix this problem, you should change the x to some other variable (say z).  I know, Grapher is weird sometimes.  <comment187358> you might want to try http://math.stackexchange.com/ <comment187511> @Buscarì›ƒ: it's not a math question, it's a software question, so I bet they'd tell me to ask here. <comment187515> Well, just assuming there are more ppl in the Math site using the Grapher then here :)
