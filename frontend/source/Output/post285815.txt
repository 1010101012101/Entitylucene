Command path for exit <body> How would I find the command path for exit?  I have already tried codewhich exit/code but that returns nothing (it just goes to a new line).   I have also played around codecd /usr/bin/code, and when in that directory using codels -R/code, but I haven't found it.    <answer285816> You're not going to find it in any directory because it's a builtin command (codeman exit/code):     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the   running shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands, the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a pipeline except the last.   A list of the Bash builtin commands for macOS can be found at the top of the man page (codeman builtin/code).   <answer285858> If your shell is ksh, zsh, or bash, you can use:  precodetype exit /code/pre  or  precodecommand -V exit /code/pre  To list the builtin commands  bash:  precodecompgen -b /code/pre  or  precodeenable -a /code/pre  ksh:  precode builtin /code/pre  zsh:  precode echo ${(k)builtins} /code/pre  For builtin manuals  bash:  precode help exit /code/pre  ksh:  precode exit --man /code/pre  zsh:  precode man zshbuiltins /code/pre  <comment360569> You can check where commands come from (a path, an alias, a function, or a builtin) with the `type` command. e.g. `type exit` <comment360615> And `type type` will explain you what is `type` :). <comment360616> @danielAzuelos - That's [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/)  :-D
