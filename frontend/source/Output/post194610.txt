Print Diff of two text files <body> I'd like to compare two text files strongon a paper/strong. Which app should I use to print a diff of two files?  I know several apps to show diff on a screen and usually use emMacVim/em. However, MacVim seems not have a feature to print diff side by side.  <answer194693> I thought perhaps BBEdit might have what you want. Under the Search menu, there is a Find Differences command, wherein the text files can be selected.  However, the result shows the file contents side-by-side, on screen. When printed, the output is merely a list of which lines did not match.  As a workaround, might I suggest the following:  ol liPerform the comparison using whatever software works for you./li liGet a screen capture (i.e., bitmap) of each page of side-by-side text./li liPrint the bitmaps./li /ol  It will be somewhat rough, but you'll (probably) have the printed sheets of line comparisons that you need.  <answer194708> There are sites that will do diff for you.  Do you use GitHub?  I think their site's Diff displays are quite nice, and seem to print just as nicely.  Otherwise a google search turn up a few other sites that offer this service, here's one that seems to have decent print support:  https://www.diffchecker.com/  Of course using this method you have to not be too worried about the confidentiality of your document, or have a great deal of trust in the service provider!  <comment232386> http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com perhaps worth a look (sorry, I don't have time to check if it includes printing, but it has many other features...)
