New Snow Leopard ... "Select All" won't Trash <body> Just ran Snow Leopard on my 10.4 Tiger iMac6.1 desktop.  All has gone swimmingly.  But now ... the way I work, I have several icons, photos, on desktop when I'm finished and I Trash them.  Clicking Edit, "Select All" highlights all, and when I drag all into Trash, it doesn't Trash.  I can individually select an icon, click and drag, into Trash. But "Select All" doesn't work.  Ideas?  <answer41731> Likely there's an item in your 'select all' that cannot be trashed; a .dmg in use or a mounted disk (your hard drive, a CD-ROM, a flash drive), for example. That'll prevent emanything/em in your selection from going into trash.  <answer41736> Hold Command when you select the trash empty button  <comment47346> He doesn't seem to be able to even move the files to the trash. Forced emptying won't help here. <comment47363> Right ... all highlight and move as a group but won't stay dropped into trash.  Ab
