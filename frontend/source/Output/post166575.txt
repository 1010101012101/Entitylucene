Error 23 trying to restore original iPad from iTunes <body> Pulled my original iPad out of my bag after returning from vacation and it had an alert on screen saying it required activation. It connected to my home wi-fi fine but failed when trying to activate. After a bunch of retries it went in to recovery mode.  I installed latest iTunes (I'm on Windows 8.1 Pro) and started the restore process. However at the stage where it states it's verifying the restore with Apple (or something to that effect) it fails with the following message:     The iPad "iPad" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (23).   I'm stuck. Tried everything I can think of. Any ideas?  <answer166581> From Resolve iOS update and restore errors  strongCheck for hardware issues/strongbr Related errors: 1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 1000, 1002, 1004, 1011, 1012, 1014, 1667, or 1669.
