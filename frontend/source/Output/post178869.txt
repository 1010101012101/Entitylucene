Can't change to Dark Mode in Yosemite <body> I'm running the latest version of Yosemite on my MacBook. I have two accounts set up, both with admin privileges. On one of my accounts, I am able to turn on dark mode from System Preferences - General ("Use dark menu bar and Dock") without a problem. On the other, checking this box does nothing. The other settings in the General category, however, work just fine (ex. Highlight color).  I have tried searching around to see if this is a problem other users are having. Could my permissions need fixing, or is this a bug?  The two apps that start up automatically when I log in to the problematic account are Carabiner and BetterSnapTool. Turning off either doesn't help either.  <comment211919> Did you fix the permissions ? <comment211922> Yes, I ran the permissions repair from Disk Utility and it's still not working. <comment211944> The permission repair in Disk Utility will fix permissions for system files only.  User files will not be affected by this.  In order to fix home folder permissions, you need to restart the system into Recovery HD, then from the menu "Utilities" choose Terminal and type in `resetpassword`, then hit Enter.  From the resulting window, choose your hard drive, then  the user, ignore the password reset section underneath and click on "Reset" at the bottom of that window where it reads something about the Home Directory Permissions and ACLs.
