Messages no longer sorting by most recent message <body> A few days ago my messaging app started acting really weird.  ul liAll old conversations have lost all but 1 single text (I think this was the most recent text but I'm not sure )/li liNew Messages are coming in but he preview message is showing a much older message./li liMessages no longer sort by date they seem to be stuck in the order they were in when this problem began, eg if I get a new message it doesnt appear at the top of the list./li /ul  Specs.  I am running 10.02, I have tried to update to 10.3.2 but everytime I try to install it verifys the update and then tells me something went wrong, I have tried to to delete download and do again with same problem.  I was having trouble with storage on my phone and at one point had 0 bytes free until I deleted some photos, at the same time my GMAIL app got itself stuck in a non working loop, so had to delete and redownload.  With any other app I would delete it and redownload it but you cant do that with messages.  I could turn off imessages  but am worried I might loose the few messages I have (though it probably makes little differnce now).  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Is there a fix?   strongUpdate/strong  I spent about 5 hours backing up and restoring my Iphone 6+ 64GB.  ul liUpgrade to 10.3.x No change to message app sorting incorrectly/li liFull reset back to factory settings.  Messaging App sorting correctly/li liRestore backup of my phone.  Messaging app not sorting correctly again./li /ul  Anyone know where I might be able to log a bug ?  LOL  <answer288114> h2Restore from a backup./h2  It looks like your phone has some serious issues with its OS. Something probably went wrong with the installation, so you should restore from a backup, or just start fresh. Here's how to do that:  h3iCloud/h3  ol liMake an iCloud Backup. Go to strongSettings - Apple ID/strong (big thing with your name at the top) strong- iCloud - iCloud Backup - Back Up Now/strong/li liDisable Find My iPhone. Go to strongSettings - Apple ID - iCloud - Find My iPhone/strong and turn off the switch. You will have to enter your Apple ID password.   ul liIf you have forgotten your Apple ID password, go to strongiForgot/strong/li /ul/li liWipe your phone. Go to strongSettings - General - Reset - Erase All Content and Settings/strong./li liWait for your phone to do a full wipe./li liIn Setup Assistant, select that you'd like to restore from an iCloud backup. Choose your desired iCloud backup./li /ol  That's it! See if it worked.  hr  h3iTunes/h3  ol liMake an iTunes backup. Connect your phone to your computer, and open iTunes. Select strongYour iPhone/strong (in the top bar) strong- Summary - Back Up Now./strong/li liDisable Find My iPhone. Go to strongSettings - Apple ID - iCloud - Find My iPhone/strong and turn off the switch. You will have to enter your Apple ID password.   ul liIf you have forgotten your Apple ID password, go to strongiForgot/strong/li /ul/li liIn iTunes, click strongRestore iPhone/strong./li liWait for the restore to complete/li liIn Setup Assistant, select that you'd like to restore from an iTunes backup and follow the directions from there./li /ol  <answer288492> First, make an strongiTunes backup/strong. As you told, you have some filesystem inconsistencies on your device, so they will being backed up, too.  Then find your iTunes backup folder:br Mac: code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup//codebr Windows: code\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\/code  There will be one randomly named folder, except you have backed up more devicesbr (something like code9182749a9879a8798a798e98798798f9879877c98798/code)  You can find your messages databese file with exactly this filename code3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28/code or codesms.db/code  You can open that file using strongSQLite database viewer/strong and export the contents to strongCSV format/strong. Then you will be able to open it in Nubers or Excel for example. There is no way to fix codesms.db/code if you can not emfind some logical error in this file by yourself/em, but you will be still able to have it in readable form back on your iPhone.  For my personal experience, I strictly recommend to upload all your content to iCloud and usebr strongDFU mode to restore fresh copy of iOS!/strong tutorial here  <comment363633> Please do try disabling and re-enabling iMessage. It only takes a few moments so the message loss toll should be very small. <comment363645> No luck I'm afraid. <comment363646> Sounds like you have a problem with many things on your phone. Is restoring an option for you? You can still restore from an iCloud backup, which keeps your data but reinstalls the OS <comment363647> Maybe I can restore from an itunes backup <comment363648> That works too. Give that a try. I'll migrate to an answer if this works <comment363934> just following up here - were you able to fix it using a backup + restore? <comment364019> No. See update to question. <comment364020> Thank you for the comprehensive answer.  Unfortunately this has not solved my issue. <comment364275> You can always file a bug: http://bugreport.apple.com <comment364304> I know a full wipe works but then I don't have my data on my phone. Thanks <comment364306> If you uncheck messages from restore, their database will be created from scratch after flashing fresh iOS. So messages will be blank, but fixed. And you will still have access to your `sms.db` backup in Numbers app. <comment364308> Maybe try to find some misspelling in that database, I believe it can be manually fixed. This was only an easy way to get things done asap, while I know this works for sure :)
