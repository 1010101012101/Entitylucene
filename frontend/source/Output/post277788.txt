After updating to iOS 10.3 I received an "Error updating metadata" alert <body> Should I be concerned about this alert? Is this related to APFS?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMnWh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment349596> Did this occur when you were in Apple's onboarding screens before viewing your home screen? <comment349648> @DocAsh59 Yes. After trying to sign into iCloud. It dumped me back to the iCloud sign in screen and succeed after I tried again. <comment349790> It does sound like it could be related to the new APFS as you mentioned. I think your best bet would be to contact Apple Support about this: https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=cups&PRKEYS=
