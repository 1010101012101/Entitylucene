Why can I not create a directory on my external hard-drive? <body> When I try to make a new directory on my external hard-drive I get a message saying that it is a "Read-only file system"  precodeLU06296APPLE:~ fortinok$ mkdir /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/working_files mkdir: /Volumes/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/working_files: Read-only file system /code/pre  However, it looks like from the permissions, that the owner of the drive should be able to "write"  precodedrwxrwxrwt@  5 root      admin                    170 Feb 16 09:02 . drwxr-xr-x  34 root      wheel                   1224 Feb 13 16:00 .. lrwxr-xr-x   1 root      admin                      1 Feb  2 08:28 Macintosh HD -&gt; / drwxr-xr-x   1 fortinok  LONGWOOD\Domain Users   4096 Feb 15 22:34 Seagate Backup Plus Drive /code/pre  Since I am the logged in user:  precodeLU06296APPLE:~ fortinok$ who fortinok console  Feb  2 08:58  fortinok ttys000  Feb 13 07:55  /code/pre  and I "own" the drive, why can I not make a new directory?  (Note: I am also unable to make a new directory using Finder.)  <comment202634> What format? NTFS? <comment202635> Is that disk formated in NTFS ? <comment202636> The whole drive is mounted read-only, so the individual permissions are not important. Can you eject the drive (in Finder) and then turn it off/on again so it gets mounted again? <comment202637> @Tetsujin how can I determine if it is NTSF? <comment202638> Get Info on the drive itself. Near the top, General  created:x Modified:x Format:... <comment202640> @Tetsujin thanks. It does say it is NTSF. <comment202642> Then you either need to fiddle in Terminal [I'll let someone else do that bit, not my strong point] or use something like Paragon NTFS or Tuxera <comment202644> @KennyPeanuts If it is your drive, empty (besides some useless Seagate Win/Mac backup apps) and no need to attach it to Windows systems just reformat it to "1 Partition Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)" <comment202646> Thanks for the info on NTFS.  Seagate, the maker of the drive has a driver that you can instal to allow writing to NTSF for this drive.  I appreciate the help. <comment202648> ah, yes, there's a version of Paragon specifically for Seagate. Glad you found it.
