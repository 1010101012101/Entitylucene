Lost Apple ID: How to recover iTunes media and iCloud data? <body> I have an iPad containing all my music and iCloud data (contacts) but I lost access to my Apple ID. I want to make a backup of the data on my iPad, create a new Apple ID and then re-import the data.   How do I do this?  <answer103630> You could just sync it with iTunes (which would also backup the contacts on the computer) on OS X or Windows. Then setup your new Apple ID, add it to the iCloud settings and continue with iCloud backup (and iTunes backup too, if you wish).  <comment121958> I ended up using Xilisoft's software, but this works too.
