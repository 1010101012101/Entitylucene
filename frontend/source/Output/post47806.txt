What is the lightning bolt icon in iCal? <body> I've gone through this document, but it's for iCal 3.0, Lion has 5.0+.  http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=iCal/3.0/en/symbls.html  Here's what it looks like, I'm not sure if it's a bolt or a tilde:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1q5ra.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hovering over it gives you no information about it, and it disappears shortly after creating the event...  <answer47807> It means it from a calendar online and you're not currently connected.  It's the same icon as in Mail for an unconnected account.  <answer47808> It means iCal is having difficulty sync-ing with iCloud, or google Calendar. Or some other calendar services that you have.
