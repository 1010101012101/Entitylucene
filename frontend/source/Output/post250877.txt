If I change my computer name how does it affect my computer's paths? <body> I wanted to change my computer's name and did so.  I used it for a while but when doing other programming related work felt like I was hitting a wall sometimes because of pathing.    I changed terminal name by executing a command line command and did the rest through strongUsers/strong in strongSystem Settings/strong inside of strongAdvanced Settings/strong that you can access by pressing emcontrol/em and emclicking/em on the User.    Ex. starting up a MySQL server/accessing MySQL command line tools/Python or php acting up.  Can changing my computer's name result in this kind of affect?  <answer250903> Not sure what you mean- you can't change the computer name in the Users &amp; Groups pref pane, you do that in the Sharing pref pane. Did you change you user account name accidentally?  In general- changing the Computer Name in Sharing will set the bonjour name (My-Computer.local), you can use the 'scutil' command to set your hostname:  precodesudo scutil --set HostName mycomputer /code/pre  <comment311846> Yes, thank you for clarifying.  I changed the account name.  But then changed it back. @macman
