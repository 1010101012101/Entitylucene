Office 365 only works on one single local account <body> I have a MS Office 365 University subscription. For separation of concerns between my private files I have two local accounts on my mac (latest el capitan). However, when I try to launch an office application on my second user account, it tells me to activate my office subscription.  How can I activate office 365 system wide across all my user accounts?  EDIT: Word Build: 15.22.1  <comment310344> What happens when you activate the subscription on the second user account? According to MS, you can use the subscription on [two devices](https://products.office.com/en-us/university) **"Get the fully installed Office experience on up to 2 PCs, Macs, or tablets and 2 phones (including Windows, Apple®, and Android™ devices)"** <comment310345> I already activated it on my laptop (win) that I use at the university <comment310347> Could you edit the post to list the build/version of the app you run to activate Office? Word 15.24 for example from http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=525133 <comment310350> @bmike edited the question
