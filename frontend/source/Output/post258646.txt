Can't make calls using facetime on Macbook pro <body> I'm using Mac OS El Capitan on the latest Macbook Pro. I emwas/em able to make Facetime before. But all of sudden now I'm not able to.  I can strongreceive/strong calls!  Everytime I try to strongmake/strong a call, I get call failed in less than a second.  Any suggestions?  h2EDIT/h2  Just minutes after posting... I tried to make my call in a different way.  Before I was using iMessage and then clicking on the details buttontelephone icon Facetime Audio.  Now instead of doing that, while still using iMessage  At the same window that you see details on the top rightâ€” I Clicked on the name of the person and did Facetime Audio and it suddenly worked...afterwards the regular details button is also working.  Not sure if this is a network issue or something :/  <comment323427> If you recently did a software update, it could be a software bug. <comment323431> @TDM actually because of an update my Safari wasn't opening as well. Took to IT. They there aware of an Update that created the Safari bug. They reinstalled it for me... So far my system is working. but that was before I fixed the Safari issue... <comment323435> So you're saying that fixing the safari issue fixed this issue? <comment323436> @TDM No before that I *think* it was fixed. After the Safari fix, my Facetime was still fixed as well. Yet I'm not sure what created the whole thing. Maybe one of the networks I was connecting had a VPN. <comment324139> @TDM just went back to not working! and whatever I do it still doesn't work. Update its working now. I closed iMessage and I went to the Facetime App and tried making the call. I'm not sure but it seems that I need to reset something. I don't know of <comment324140> Try booting the computer in safe mode and see if it works: shut off the computer, then press power button. After startup sound, press and hold shift key until it asks for password, then try using FaceTime. It will take the computer longer to boot in safe mode. Let me know what happens.
