Save multiple photos from Mail on iPhone <body> I send a lot of emails to myself from my Mac to my iPhone containing logos that I am designing, normal pictures or otherwise.  However, I have a problem with the Mail app.  Whenever I send too many photos, or photos that are very big, I have to go through the message and save each photo individually to Photos.  Whenever I send small, or just a few pictures, when I hold my tap on the picture, it will give me a prompt to save all of the pictures in the email.    My question:  Is there any way to save all of the pictures from an email, no matter the number or size of the photos?  Screenshots would be appreciated.  Thanks!  <answer49608> Okay, so I found the way to do it.  It's actually really simple.  Just tap the Forward/Reply icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fqQmV.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then press the save button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zBGxe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hope this helps someone in the future!
