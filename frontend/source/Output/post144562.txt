Customize accents when holding down a key <body> I just noticed that if I hold down a key in mac when typing, that I get some custom bar that let's me choose between accents.   I'm a mathematician, and I like writing unicode math symbols directly (like α). Is there a way that I can customise the toolbar that pops-up, so that I can put my own mathematical unicode symbols in this toolbar ?   <answer144568> ol liNavigate to code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources//code./li liBackup the codeKeyboard-en.plist/code file./li liAppend the following to the codeKeyboard-en.plist/code file (before the closing code&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/plist&gt;/code), changing the keycaps to be your desired space-delimited list of characters.  precode&lt;key&gt;Roman-Accent-t&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Direction&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;right&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Keycaps&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;× ÷ √ π ∴ ∵ ≈ ≠ ∞&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Strings&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;× ÷ √ π ∴ ∵ ≈ ≠ ∞&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre/li /ol  Feel free to change the codeRoman-Accent-t/code to any character you wish, providing it does not already have Press &amp; Hold keys assigned. Also see shortening the Press &amp; Hold time if you're using it regularly.  <comment170277> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20505/how-to-add-characters-to-the-press-and-hold-character-picker-in-os-x-lion here is an answer to Your question <comment170317> I'd add, that this file could be overwritten after OS update. So make also a copy of changed plist file.
