What orthodox file manager for OS X could I use? <body> I'm looking for a graphical file manager fro OS X, for console Midnight Commander is ok.  I need two panels, function keys operations and preferably FTP and SCP support.  Also, it would be great to be free.  <answer10104> h2muCommander (free)/h2  muCommander has classic orthodox file manager keybindings. Sadly MC is not very mac'ish and lacks multiple tabs.  <answer12715> h2XCommander ($4.99)/h2  I have recently noticed XCommander in the Mac App Store. It has classic NortonCommander keybindings, so it's already more usable than PathFinder and Transmit.   Sadly it has a long way to go to reach TotalCommander standards. No multiple tabs, no quicklook.  What I like though is that it's new and it gets the keybindings right from the start. This is promising.  <answer15570> h2Moroshka File Manager (free)/h2  Today I discovered another commander, the Moroshka File Manager. It has multiple tabs. Looks great. In particular the footer of the main-window is neat.  <answer15573> h2Path Finder/h2  Although not free, I have been using Path Finder for years and love it dearly. Two features I like the most from this applications are:  ol liI can have two side-by-side panels, what you are looking for. Not only that, each panel can have multiple tabs./li liI can go into a directory by hitting the return key, cmd+O still works./li /ol  <answer15655> h2TotalFinder/h2  I use http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/  <answer25401> h2Xmander (free)/h2  Xmander is a simple dual panel file manager with a hex file viewer. You can browse through all your system's files, including the hidden and perform the basic file operations like move, copy, trash or create directory.  <answer25483> Since nobody added it as an answer I thought I may.  h2ForkLift (23,99 € / $29.99 / £20.99)/h2  Definitely a winner for me. Features list on its website: http://www.binarynights.com/ but it pretty much has anything you'd want from an orthodox file manager and it does look nice too :)   <answer83513> h2Mover (free)/h2  ul liopen/run files and apps/li libatch copy/move/delete, file/folder creation/li liOperations queue/li lisearch files (with wildcards and regex)/li lishow/hide hidden files/li likeyboard shortcut mapping/li limove to Trash/li licustomizable UI/li lilistening to file system events/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mih7F.png" alt="mover" title="Click for full size"  <answer101259> h1FastCommander/h1  http://osx-fastcommander.appspot.com  Supports all file operations. Fast, stable, small, lightweight.  Can be freely downloaded and used - no restrictions, just nag screen.  <answer104471> h2CRAX Commander/h2  This is a graphical, dual-panel file manager with support for operations (copy, move, delete). This software has built-in support for SSH and FTP. This is not free software but you can download a demo version from the program site.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HVISf.png" alt="CRAX Screenshot"  <answer118663> h2Newton Commander (free + open source)/h2  ul liEach tab runs in its own process./li liA tab can run as a different user, eg. root./li liNo beachballs since it's only the child process that is hanging and not the UI./li /ul  <answer124982> Cloud Commander is orthodox web file manager for Mac OS, Windows and Linux.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0OZa4.png" alt="Cloud Commander"  ul liOpen Source (MIT)/li liHas Web UI/li liHas build in editor with syntax highlighting./li liHas build in console./li /ul  <answer190558> h1Disk Order ($25)/h1  Surprised I haven't seen it mentioned, Disk Order has been around since 2003. My personal choice, can do (S)FTP and all the operation expected from a dual pane file manager in a keyboard friendly way – unlike some of the Finder spin-offs.  Not free though and lately updates haven't been happening that often.  <answer231049> h2Double Commander (LGPLv2)/h2  Double Commander is inspired by Total Commander, and is a cross-platform application that works well on OSX (I'm running on Yosemite, 10.10.5, Early 2015 Macbook).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDg32.jpg" alt="Double Commander screenshot" title="Click for full-sized image"  It is highly configurable (in the screenshot, compared with "out of the box", I have configured the free-space display, enabled the left-sidebar tree view, added zebra-stripes, and used Linux Bionlinum as the display font). A partial feature list from the website:  ul liUnicode support/li liTabbed interface/li liMulti-rename tool/li liCustom columns/li liBuilt in file viewer (F3) to view files of in hex, binary or text format/li liInternal text editor (F4) with syntax hightlighting/li liArchives are handled like subdirectories. You can easily copy files to and from archives. Supported archive types: ZIP, TAR GZ, TGZ, LZMA and also BZ2, RPM, CPIO, DEB, RAR./li liAll operations working in background/li liExtended search function with full text search in any files/li liConfigurable button bar to start external programs or internal menu commands/li liTotal Commander WCX, WDX and WLX plug-ins support/li li+ supports FTP/Network operations/li /ul  It has recently (as of this posting) reached 0.7 and was noted on Webupd8 where a bit of a review plus more description can be found.  For those Mac users who like their apps "pretty", this interface will probably leave something to be desired. For those accustomed to using "commander"-like file managers on Windows or Linux, but now are on Macs ... it is a treat!  <answer277844> Total Commander works on macOS under Wine. By far not the same experience as on a windows box, but adding this answer here for the sake of completeness.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/icAsx.png" alt="enter image description here"  The procedure is not complicated, but requires some dependencies which you might have already installed for other purposes:   ol liInstall XQuartz with codebrew cask install xquartz/code/li liInstall wine with codebrew install wine/code/li liDownload the TC installer, then launch it from the terminal with codewine tcmd900ax64.exe/code./li liCreate an alias or launcher script which will run  codewine ~/.wine/drive_c/totalcmd/TOTALCMD64.EXE/code (if you installed under the default path)./li /ol  For some reason latest versions of wine do not enable font antialiasing by default. It can be enabled with winetricks by doing codebrew install winetricks/code and then running codewinetricks settings fontsmooth=rgb/code in the terminal.  It might be possible that certain things, i.e. TC plugins might not work with the 64bit version of Wine. In that case you might want to try with the 32bit version under a 32bit version of wine.

For more information about it, check: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/6727/115 <comment16944> You can change keyboard shortcuts via Preferences window in Forklift. You can even select TotalCommander shortcuts if you're familiar with those. ForkLift2 is definitely the file manager of my choice. <comment16945> Agreed with Michal M: Forklift can do the full Orthodox keystrokes if that's what you like. <comment16946> PathFinder isn't generally considered to be an Orthodox File Manager, though as it is missing several defining features.  For one, it's missing the ability to copy files from one panel to another with the press of a single button. <comment16950> What is an "Orthodox" file manager? I am not mocking, I just don't know what it is. <comment16953> See [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_file_manager#Orthodox_file_managers). <comment16984> PathFinder has many nice features, but really bad keyboard shortcuts, e.g. TAB key is not working. <comment17003> @neoneye you can't even configure it, the keyboard shortcuts editor does not work. <comment17028> Duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4944/are-there-any-free-alternatives-to-finder <comment17029> See also: Also: http://superuser.com/questions/29268/alternative-file-managers-on-mac-os-x <comment17069> This is not a duplicate, because this is specifically about orthodox file managers. Dual pane and classic OFM shortcuts. <comment17096> -1 because TotalFinder doesn't have the requested SCP and FTP support. <comment17097> +1 for ForkLift -- an excellent application that's not nearly as well known as it ought to be. <comment96134> Welcome to Ask Different! Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment104969> If I may add a comment to this ancient thread:  Path Finder 6 — released about a year ago as I type this — finally added the "missing" functionality to make it a true OFM when operating in dual-pane mode.  The default keybindings for its orthodox actions every use the function keys, as per Norton Commander and other classic OFMs.  Given this, Path Finder 6 is now arguably the most fully-featured orthodox file manager for OS X.  While not without its issues, its more actively maintained than Disk Order or Forklift, and unlike TotalFinder it's a standalone application and not just a Finder hack. <comment122947> Thanks for the answers on this. Be sure to read the [promotion section](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior) on [Help Center](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help) if you recommend the same software several times. <comment133764> This is awesome - almost exactly what I wanted. Thank you! <comment153290> Crax is great. I've tried them all, and finally set my self with the Crax. I was power total commander user; and although Crax still doesnt have all the TC features, it is the most complete one. Also, the developer is very responsive. <comment182276> I used to use Total Commander and this is the closest Mac OS X alternative I could find. <comment187470> I'm new and need 10 rep to post an answer (even though I got 100 rep from being on stackoverflow too... weird). so I will add as a comment : nobody mentionned Double Commander, a free multiplatform (Windows, Linux, OSX, BSD) clone of Total Commander. It seems quite complete. But for now looks awful on retina displays. http://doublecmd.sourceforge.net/ <comment214364> It is headed the right direction. Yet it is still not mature enough. <comment367693> I used to use muCommander all the time. I even have some patches to it so that shortcut keys are better supported on OSX with polish keyboard, but it's so utterly slow and the damn viewer does not support Find using shortcut... damn! I have switched to Double Commander now, it requires some changes etc, but it's really fantastic - has all of the required options, good preview and is super fast.. <comment367694> I am a longtime user of muCommander, I have made some patches to it so that it better supports polish keyboard and some osx specific shortcuts. I would live with that, I could even live with the very poor viewer which doesn't support the Find shortcut. But it's utterly slow! Going up 3 directories with a quick home+enter sequence could lead to getting back to the same directory... It was great when there was no alternative, but now depending on whether you like Finder more [Forklift2] or Total Commander [Double Commander] there are better options. <comment374329> I had tried quite a few managers today. I am shifting from ForkLift to Path Finder after using the former heavily for three years.
