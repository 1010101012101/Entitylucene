How can I remove an update from the Managed Software Center? <body> I am asked to update my OS to version 10.12, but I already have updated to 10.12.2 manually.  So, how can I remove remove or mark as unneeded this update in the Managed Software Center?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A1iZ6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment333044> I don't know if you're aware, and for anyone else potentially confused, Managed Software Center is third party software, not part of macOS.
