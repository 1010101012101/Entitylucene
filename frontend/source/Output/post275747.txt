Can I force a misbehaving application to open its windows smaller? <body> The application Genymotion opens its Android emulator windows at full size, regardless of how large they were when I closed them last time, and I always have to manually resize them.  If this were happening under Unix/X-Windows, I could tell the window manager to recognise these windows when they open and force them to open at a smaller size.  Is there some hook I can use to do this under MacOS, without having to wire a hotkey up to an Applescript?  <comment346921> I do not use Genymotion, so all I can say is... if an app does not conform to the norm, then a workaround may be your only choice. I'd probably make an AppleScript app that launches Genymotion and sets it `bounds` to what I want.
