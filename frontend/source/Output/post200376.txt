No output from MacBook Pro audio jack (input OK) <body> I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009) and I've tried just about everything I can think of to fix this.  The problem is that I can't hear anything out of my headphone jack.  I can set it to input instead of output and I can input audio just fine, but it refuses to output (yes, I'm using the proper "Use audio port for:" settings.)  I can get normal output from the mac speakers.  I can't remember having this problem before.  The only difference is that I just moved into my college dorm.  There was nothing abnormal about the move; put my laptop in its case, headed about 10 miles from my house, and I was there.  Here's what I've tried:  ul liResetting the PRAM/li liEverything in System PrefSound/li liChanging bit rate in Audio MIDI Setup/li liJiggling a toothpick into the audio port (No, I don't have the red light problem)/li liTaking out, putting to sleep, plugging in, and waking up/li liTrying my headphones with something else/li liSacrificing a new-born child/li /ul  And still nothing works.  Any other suggestions that I haven't thought of would be appreciated!  <comment241895> You say you've moved dormitories.  What kind of move was that?  From another dorm, across town, or further?  How was the computer transported?  Can you get a qualified tech to look inside the computer? <comment241896> Sorry to hear about the baby. :-) <comment241905> assume you can get sound out of the Macbook speakers? If not may be an amp issue = motherboard <comment242870> Thanks, I will try to get a tech guy to look at, info was updated otherwise. <comment242939> Boot from an external system, that will help you figure out wether it's a software or hardware issue.
