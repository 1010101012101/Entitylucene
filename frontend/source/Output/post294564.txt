Mac only able to connect to one AirPod? <body> Currently only my left AirPod is connected to my Mac and I can't figure out a way to have it recognize my right AirPod! My research suggests I need to completely reset my AirPods but I don't want to do that...  <answer294565> No need to reset. Just connect your AirPods to another device such as your iPhone and then connect back to Mac.  If that doesn't work then trying removing the pairing from your Mac in Bluetooth settings and pairing them again like you did the first time. Unfortunately this seems to be a bug.
