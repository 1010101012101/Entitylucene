Looking for a Billings Pro alternative <body> Like the title says, i'm looking for a program (preferably free!) that has similar features to Billings Pro. I'm a part-time web developer and it was unnecessary to have to pay for Billings Pro just to have a program to create 2-3 invoices per month.  What i'm looking for is a program that will let me:  ul liCreate Invoices/li liCreate recurring Invoices/li liCreate Clients/li /ul  Does anyone know a (free) program can do the above things?  <answer225935> If you can find an old copy of Billings (pre Pro), that still works without the subscription, I would grab that. I've been using my copy for the last 5 years with no need to switch to the subscription model. A quick google and I found this: http://billings.en.softonic.com/mac but I don't personally know this site.  <comment274283> As written it is hard to see why simply using Pages to create the invoices and Numbers to keep track of open payments isn't going to solve your problem. <comment274290> Can you tell me which version do you have? I need to know what i'm looking for :) <comment274292> Sorry @user2093301 it's installed on my laptop at home, but I'm 99% sure it's Billings 3 from the screenshots that I checked on Google. While Googling, I also saw you can buy it on Amazon for less than $10.
