Apple Compressor's distributed processing for Autodesk Maya <body> Is there a way to render Autodesk Maya 2017 animation via codeCompressor 4.3/code using 10 iMacs?   It was possible in previous versions of Compressor (version 2, version 3 and up to version 4.0.7) There were codeQmaster/code and codeQadministrator/code utilities. But I can't run Compressor 4.0.7 or those utilities on macOS 10.12.  A distributed processing is necessary feature for any command line VFX professional application. For instance: emNuke, Shake, Fusion, Maya, Houdini, Renderman, etc.../em  I am convinced, there is a workaround to use the distributed processing for CLI applications via Terminal (even if this feature is not explicitly supported in codeCompressor 4.3/code GUI).  strongP.S. Distributed processing isn't supported in Compressor's GUI since 2013 (from v4.1)./strong Compressor's versions 4.1, 4,2 and 4.3 have codeintegrated Qmaster/code's core allowing to process just Final Cut Pro X and Motion batches using shared computers (as instances). Now Compressor is mainly used for transcoding.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nwQbx.png" alt="enter image description here"  Look at codeQmaster.framework/code located in:  precode/Applications/Compressor/Contents/Plugins/Compressor/CompressorKit.bundle/Contents/Frameworks /code/pre  To see a list of CLI commands, type this in Terminal:  precode/Applications/Compressor.app/Contents/MacOS/Compressor -help /code/pre  <answer291337> After a thorough research I found out that it's impossible to use Apple Compressor 4.3 via command line for distributed processing.  <comment366400> Does this help?: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21243?locale=en_US.  Note that batch processing is supported but true distributed processing isn’t (IIRC, beginning with Compressor 4, Apple scrapped Qmaster) <comment366402> I read it, thank you. The question is: what's the workaround? <comment366403> From what I can tell, there is no workaround for true distributed processing on MacOS. (I have done this same research pretty exhaustively.) My only thought would be Pooch. See these two links: http://daugerresearch.com/pooch/parallelapps.shtml, http://daugerresearch.com/pooch/quicktime.shtml. Also see the “About Pooch” pages. <comment367817> You're right, Qmaster in Compressor 4.3 is suitable for transcoding only.
