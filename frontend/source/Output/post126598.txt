iphone 5 merged mail contacts become unmerged <body> I have linked all my contacts phone numbers and their e-mail addresses from Hotmail together to see their phone numbers and mail addresses in one place. After a while Ä± found out that all separated again. It has happened twice. Do you know why?  <comment148318> Are they double? <comment148527> There are two entries one for phone number and one for e-mail for the same person.
