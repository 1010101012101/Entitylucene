2017 MacBook Pro can't connect to Dell P2715Q via USB-C to DisplayPort cable <body> I purchased a USB-C to DisplayPort cable from Amazon to connect my 2017 MacBook Pro to a Dell 2715Q however it does not seem to be working.   From what I've read and from some of the cable reviews, there shouldn't be an issue yet my MacBook does not recognize the display. The monitor seems to know that it is connected to a device and shows a message saying that there is no signal coming from the computer.  Is it possible that there is some setup I need to do, or is there a compatibility issue between the display and cable? Or is it possible the cable is no good? Any help would be greatly appreciated!  <answer286801> I used the Star Tech USB to DisplayPort Cable to a similar model monitor, and it worked.  On 1 monitor I had to manually change the DP version.  <answer288407> Hi I have the same problem with my MacBook-pro 2017 and the Dell 2415Q with two different usb-c - Displayport (one from apple). I called apple support, finally they have changed the MacBook, I got a brand new one which still does not recognise the Dell (it is exactly the same with my other display Dell U2417H).  <answer293828> I had this problem, and after it driving me to the brink of insanity for a couple of weeks, trying all different methods and losing tons of time, I found this: https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-DisplayPort-Adapter-Thunderbolt/dp/B01K51GM46/ref=sr_1_21?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501663062&amp;sr=1-21&amp;keywords=macbook+pro+displayport+2017  So, Apple basically changed the 2017 version in some way compared to the 2016 one. The support guys didnt know about that, but luckily some 3rd party vendors has managed to catch up..  <comment361767> Have you tried multiple ports on your computer? Does the computer recognize that a cord is plugged into it? (Does the screen flicker to black when you plug it in and unplug it?) Based on your description, it sounds to me like a connection problem between the MBP and the cable <comment361776> I'm using this one and it's working: https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-DisplayPort-1-8m-Chromebook-Thunderbolt/dp/B01EXKDRAC <comment361792> @NoahL Yeah, I've tried different ports and there is no flicker when I plug the cable in, but I'm not sure If the MacBook isn't detecting the cable or if there a problem with the cable itself. <comment361801> My thoughts would then be to try another cable (don't return that one just yet, try to use another one you already have). If a different cable still doesn't work, try reseting the NVRAM (and maybe the SMC). <comment361986> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.
