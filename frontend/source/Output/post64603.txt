dyld message when launching commands as sudo <body> When I launch a command from the shell as super user I always get back the following message:  precodedyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/sudo) is setuid or setgid /code/pre  I tried to unset all the codeDYL***/code variables and verify it with the codeset/code command, as suggested here. However it doesn't fixed my problem.  I'm running 10.8.2 with Xcode 4.5 and the command line tools updated today.  Please find below my code.profile/code, I don't have a code.bash_profile/code  precode# Git  [ -f ~/.git-bash-completion.sh ] &amp;&amp; . ~/.git-bash-completion.sh  # define colors and default command line # h is the host name, w the complete path (W for only the current dir) export PS1="\h:\w$ "  export CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=ExFxCxDxBxegedabagacad  export CPATH=/opt/local/include:/usr/local/include export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib/ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:/usr/local/lib export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:/opt/local/Library/Frameworks:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib/:$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH  # Homebrew export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH" export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH"  # ROS export PATH=/usr/local/lib/wxPython/bin:$PATH # The line below is commnted because it is imported with rosjava # If you want to remove rosjava, uncomment it in order to use ros-fuerte source ~/Software/ros/fuerte/ros-stacks/setup.bash # source /Users/luca/Software/ros-java/setup.bash export ROS_HOSTNAME=luca-macbook export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/Software/ros-stacks:~/Development/ export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=osx:homebrew  export SVN_EDITOR="/usr/bin/nano"  alias GoToPhdRoot="cd ~/Documents/University/PhD" alias Smultron="open -a Smultron\ 4" alias MakeBuildDir="mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build" function UpdateAndBuildPdf() {      svn up &amp;&amp; pdflatex "$1" &amp;&amp; bibtex "$1" &amp;&amp; pdflatex "$1" &amp;&amp; rm "$1.aux" &amp;&amp; rm "$1.bbl" &amp;&amp; rm "$1.blg" &amp;&amp; rm "$1.log" &amp;&amp; Open "$1.pdf"  } /code/pre  To be noticed that also if I comment the line in which I export codeDYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH/code the problem persists.  N.B. I don't have Asepsis installed.  <answer69242> I found out that the warning is generated by the line  precodesource ~/Software/ros/fuerte/ros-stacks/setup.bash /code/pre  It is a line needed if you have installed ROS.  Commenting the line fixes the problem. However ROS cannot work without this line.   <comment78926> Do you run Asepsis? <comment78943> No, I don't! I found some posts where they said that the problem is related to Asepsis, but I don't even know it! <comment79082> haha ok fair enough. I had the same problem and Asepsis was the issue, only reason I asked. I would edit the question to say that you dont use it. <comment79092> can you please paste in your .bash_profile? <comment79142> @SamuelE.Giddins Done, thanks! <comment235589> Your problem isn't really fixed. This shell script is buggy, and around a very important stuff: dynamic libraries and setuid binaries. You should try to fix it and report the bug to its author.
