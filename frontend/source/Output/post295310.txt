'Installation Failed' after trying to just restart into guest mode <body> After I tried to log into the guest account for the first time after enabling filevault, it told me the computer was going to restart to a secure environment.  However, after restarting the computer didn't prompt for the unlock password at all, and went straight to this screen after a wait. After a few seconds this screen crashes and the computer turns off.  What can I do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hxBpm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
