Simulate INSERT key in Mac OS X <body> Long story short, I am using Citrix to remote into my PC at work, and several applications require the use of the INSERT key, which, as everyone knows, Apple chose to eliminate from their keyboards. I've tried everything I can think of, and never been able to find an easy way to send this keycode via Citrix.  I'm sure there are other uses for this, and I've read quite a few people's questions on the subject, but no one seems to have offered a viable solution.  I have the Apple USB keyboard (full-size, with numeric keypad), and in the position where the INSERT key would normally exist, Apple placed the "fn" key. Now, I still need this key from time to time, but what I'd love to see is perhaps Control-fn or similar to send the keycode for INSERT.  If anyone knows how to achieve this, preferably without installing 3rd-party software (adware?), I'm all ears.    <answer169164> For Midnight commander it seem to be kbd^/Ctrl/kbd+kbdT/kbd=kbdInsert/kbd. As suggested by jherran.  The more generic Insert function is supposed to be kbdFn/kbd+kbdReturn/Enter/kbd=kbdInsert/kbd, see this other question for more discussion and details.  I have however had little success with kbdFn/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd working reliably in many applications.  <answer191070> Get non-apple external keyboad.  <answer252731> You can follow this post which suggesting to use Karabiner app to simulate emInsert/em key with the following configuration of codeprivate.xml/code file (edit in emMisc/em tab):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Fn + Ctrl-Left to Insert&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.fn_ctrl_to_insert&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__KeyCode::CONTROL_L, ModifierFlag::FN,       KeyCode::PC_INSERT     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  and then enable newly created item after reloading the file in emChange Key/em tab.  To find out the right key code, use emEventViewer/em in emMisc/em tab.  <answer269887> I've been succesful with fn + tab key in some apps.  Give it a try and good luck!  <answer276230> The only combination I have found is Ctrl + A.  Edit: macOS Sierra  <answer288098> fn + tab works as the insert key in the Freeplane mind map software  <comment199042> Thanks, but no, that doesn't seem to work for me, either.  As I mentioned above, I'm actually using Citrix, but it should be a fairly generic key-mapping. If one doesn't exist, I'd appreciate knowing how to create a custom key binding. <comment219880> There's a great thread at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/84389/how-do-i-simulate-the-insert-key-in-windows-on-a-macbook-pro/ <comment367540> Downvoted into oblivion, but yes, this is probably the most generic - if not all to obvious - solution to this problem. In case all else fails, get another keyboard.
