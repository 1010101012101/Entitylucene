Is there a way to forward individual voicemails on the iPhone <body> I would like to send a voicemail I received to someone else for them to be able to listen to the exact same audio.  Is there a way to forward an individual voicemail to someone else, whether by email or some other means?  <answer16265> Hopefully someone else can provide an easier answer or an app that automates this, but the method I've found so far only works for jailbroken phones:  ol liUse iFile or some other file manager to access .amr files that are stored in code/var/mobile/Library/Voicemail/code. The files are numbered sequentially and codevoicemail.db/code looks like its used to organize them./li liTry to locate the correct .amr using timestamp./li liUse file manager to email .amr file to myself or someone else./li /ol  A sidenote is that doing this I was able to find some orphaned .amr files that seemed to not have been completely deleted (.amr files are still stored when deleted until they are cleared from Deleted Messages). I was able to safely delete these old voicemails (over a year old, probably persisting from backups) from the folder.
