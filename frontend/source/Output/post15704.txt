Video editing application for Mac <body> I'm interested in starting to edit videos and I'm looking for a good video editing application. It shouldn't be too complicated but one should be able to do advanced stuff with it too. I currently got iMovie but it's too simple for me.   Any tips?  <answer15706> I can recommend Final Cut Express and if you want it real pro - Final Cut Pro. Note that a major new Final Cut version is nearly out - probably with the MacOS X Lion. Also note that some price drop is expected for both products, probably you should wait a month.  <answer15710> IMHO with imovie you can achieve NICE results, especially, when you strongstarting to edit/strong.   iMovie has several very nice features (some are not obvious at the first look), and emprobably/em you still do not discover them all.  Using professional applications like FinalCut and so on, i'm strongnot recommending/strong for someone who emstarting to edit/em. But, opinions are like slaps - they're always different. :)  Maybe, can you be more exact - what feature you missing from iMovie?  (0,02$) :)  <comment17193> What kind of feature are you missing in iMovie? <comment17854> What about software to create animations and such? See my question: http://superuser.com/questions/300457
