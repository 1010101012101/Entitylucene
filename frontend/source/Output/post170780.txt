Application will not launch after crash or force quit <body> I have an App (Transmission) which won't launch after it hangs and I force quit. It  won't launch from the Dock or applications folder. A reboot will resolve the problem  but I have another long running process which I don't want to interrupt. Is there some way to get it to launch without rebooting? Transmission is not listed as a running process in Activity monitor or codeps -ef | grep -i transmission/code  OSX version 10.8.2  <comment278334> I ran in to the same problem, transmission was locked up and I force quit it, and then it wouldn't launch again. I'm on El Capitan and restart fixed it for me.
