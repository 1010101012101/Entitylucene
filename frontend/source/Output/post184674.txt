MacBook Pro goes black for a second or two and then comes back on <body> My MacBook Pro (mid 2012) 15â€³ goes black for a second or two while I'm using it and then comes back on as soon as I touch the trackpad, or sometimes it comes back on its own. It's very sporadic. Why is this happening and how can I prevent it?  <answer184693> That actually sounds like an intermittent connection caused by a broken wire/conductor, or a bad solder joint. Essentially, you have two ends of a conductor that emshould/em be joined, but mild vibration is causing them to make/break contact, causing the symptoms you describe.  However, you should confirm that your screen saver settings aren't set to turn on after a very short duration.  ol listrongSystem Preferences/strong  strongDesktop &amp; Screen Saver/strong  strongScreen Saver/strong tab./li liAt the bottom-left, try setting strongStart after/strong = Never/li /ol  BTW, if you want easy method to manually enable the screen saver, click strongHot Corners/strong and set a corner for strongStart Screen Saver/strong.  It would be good news if just the screen saver is causing the blank screen.  Otherwise, you should send the macbook in for repairs (when you have a break from needing it).
