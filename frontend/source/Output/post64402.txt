Automatically reboot OS X 10.7 after kernel panic? <body> Is there a way to set up Mac OS X (10.7) to automatically reboot after kernel panics?  Yes, it shouldn't kernel panic, I know.  But it does.  I've replaced all the RAM in the system, ran memtest and smart test but it still crashes about once a week.  No 3rd party kernel modules loaded.  It would be almost not annoying if it was automatically rebooting, hence the question.  <answer64405> Open the strongEnergy Saver/strong pane in System Preferences. There's an option to emRestart automatically if the computer freezes/em, if you check that you should get the behaviour you desire.  Note that there are two tabs in Energy Saverâ€”one for when you're on battery and one for when you're running from the power adapter; make sure you set it for each state you want.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBnft.png" alt="Energy Saver Preferences"  <answer64424> I don't know if something changed on Mountain Lion, but I no longer have the checkbox to restart automatically if the computer freezes.  My MacBook Air restarts automatically a few seconds after this message is shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Fpgn.jpg" alt="Your computer restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up."  If I'm using it in clamshell mode, I can press any key on an external keyboard to restart immediately.  <comment75617> Does kernel panic qualify as freezing? <comment75618> @lhf I will find out sooner than I would like. <comment75619> Automatically rebooting after kernel panics might be a bad idea if you get many of these. You might even be caught in a reboot loop, God forbid. <comment75656> When I am caught in the reboot loop I will get a new computer. <comment75752> worked like a charm :(
