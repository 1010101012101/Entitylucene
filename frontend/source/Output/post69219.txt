Why can't I connect to hotspots on my iPad (3rd generation)? <body> I am having problems with connecting to the internet via WiFi on my iPad (3rd Gen).  It works, however, when I connect using Bluetooth.  Any ideas on why this is and how I can get my internet working over WiFi?  <comment80416> Any hints on what happens when you try or do? Which hotspots, can you connect to the Wifi at home? <comment80419> it connects but there is no internet access. but it will work if i connect using the bluetooth feature. when the bluetooth connects, it also connects with the wifi, so now it is connected using both and on my ipad it is says there are 2 connections. <comment80422> Which bluetooth feature? What are you connecting? Please add some detail to your question because right now it's impossible to answer. <comment80423> if my computer is connected to ipad via bluetooth it automatically uses the hotspot, as should the wifi and USB connections. but when i try to connect with just the wifi it cannot connect to the internet. i am connecting with my MBP 15" also i am trying to give some friends internet but it will not work. <comment80424> after i connect using bluetooth it, for some reason, connects with the wifi as well and then after the bluetooth connection works, i can disconnect from bluetooth and the wifi will then work. i honestly dont understand this.... when i connect just using wifi it gives me the "!" over the wifi icon in the menubar and says "Cannot connect to the internet"
