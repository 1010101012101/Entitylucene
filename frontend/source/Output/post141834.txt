Applescript to change desktop image on all monitors? <body> I have the following code to change the desktop image of my Macbook  precodetell application "System Events" tell current desktop set picture to "/Library/Desktop Pictures/Beach.jpg" end tell end tell /code/pre  How do change all desktops - I have a second monitor.  <answer141842> This might work. I only have one monitor so couldn't properly test it.  precodetell application "System Events"     set desktopCount to count of desktops     repeat with desktopNumber from 1 to desktopCount         tell desktop desktopNumber             set picture to "/Library/Desktop Pictures/Beach.jpg"         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <answer270961> The previous answers look great, but I wanted to share a way I found to do this with much less code.  precodetell application "System Events"     tell every desktop         set picture to "path/to/picture.png"     end tell end tell /code/pre  You could even condense it to one line:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell every desktop to set picture to "path/to/picture.png" /code/pre  <comment357078> and if you only want to change one of your desktops, just "tell desktop 1/2/3/whatever" instead of "tell every desktop".
