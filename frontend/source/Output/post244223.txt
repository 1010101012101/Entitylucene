Shuffle PDF 2-up in shell <body> I want to make a new pdf from my old one: put portrait pages 1 &amp; 2 on a landscape page 1, pages 3 &amp; 4 on page 2, and so on.  codePreview.app/code does this, but I need to do it in the shell.  codejPDFtweak.jar/code also does this in GUI, but for no reason it fails to do it in terminal (for some of my files).  I do not know, how to use codelp/code to print to pdf.  <answer244230> Thanks to @IconDaemon, the solution is like this:  precodecpdf -twoup-stack my-file.pdf -o out.pdf cpdf -rotate 90 out.pdf -o out2.pdf cpdf -scale-to-fit "210mm 297mm" out2.pdf -o my-file-collated.pdf rm out.pdf out2.pdf /code/pre  <comment300915> You might want to take a look at [Coherent's](http://community.coherentpdf.com/) command line PDFs tools.
