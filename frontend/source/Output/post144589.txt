How can I set the default browser depending on time of day? <body> I have a MacBook Pro from work. To keep my browsing history separate, I use 2 different browsers. (Chrome = Work, Safari = Fun)   I want to make my default browswer Chrome while at work (9 am to 6pm), and Safari my default browser in the evenings. This will prevent me from accidentially opening a link in the wrong browser.   How could I switch my default browser at predefined times throughout the day?   strongUpdate/strong  There does not appear to be a 'set default browser' workflow in automator. Perhaps it would be possible to edit this file?   precode/Users/yourname/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist /code/pre  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2803775?tstart=0  <answer144669> Expanding on my comment above....  hr  See the comment by user kerma at this related StackFlow article   His little command line app at https://github.com/kerma/defaultbrowser does what you need.  He provided the source code but it was designed for 10.9. A small change can make it to compile on 10.6 as well. I tested it on my system and it worked correctly.  All you then need to do is run it like this...  precode#defaultbrowser -set firefox  #defaultbrowser -set safari /code/pre  The changes I made, to make it work with 10.6,  were  a) Add the Cocoa framework  b) Make the following code change...  Replace   precodeNSString *split = HTTPHandlers[i]; /code/pre  with  precodeNSString *split = [HTTPHandlers objectAtIndex:i]; /code/pre  EDIT:  As was pointed out, the code does not change the default browser for HTTPS. To add that functionality, I added the following lines...   Find the first line below, and add the second one for https  precodeCFStringRef urlschemeref = ( CFStringRef)@"http"; CFStringRef urlschemeref2 = ( CFStringRef)@"https"; /code/pre  and the same here  precodeOSStatus s = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(urlschemeref, newHandler); OSStatus s2 = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(urlschemeref2, newHandler); /code/pre  Finally change  precodeif (s == 0) { /code/pre  to  precodeif (s == 0 &amp;&amp; s2 == 0) { /code/pre  Regarding the scheduling, since they know what cron is, I assume they know how to make the necessary changes. If not, a google search would provide the necessary answers. So the cron lines would be...  precode0 9 0 0 1-5 /path/to/app/defaultbrowser -set chrome 0 18 0 0 1-5 /path/to/app/defaultbrowser -set safari /code/pre  BUT, a much better way, because cron tasks will not run when system is powered down, is to have a means to detect location (like wifi connection) and change according to that. So if the cron job is set at 9am and you arrive late to work, you powerup your device at 9:15am nothing will happen...  So, as discussed here, I would recommend that they install ControlPlane or something like it, and schedule the change upon connection to the  wifi/network instead.  Hope that helped.  <answer144691> Based on Vic's answer, this is what I came up with.   Download defaultbrowser, create a cronjob to run at 9 am and 6pm.  Because there is no gui, it will require taking advantage of the fact that mac is unix.   First checkout the source code of codedefaultbrowser/code, and copy it to code/usr/local/bin/code  precodegit clone https://github.com/kerma/defaultbrowser.git /tmp/defaultbrowser sudo cp /tmp/defaultbrowser/build/defaultbrowser /usr/local/bin/ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/defaultbrowser /code/pre  Then to schedule the binary to be run at specific times, run the following:  precodeEDITOR=NANO crontab -e  0 9 * * 1-5 /usr/local/bin/defaultbrowser -set chrome &gt;&gt; /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; echo $(date) &gt;&gt; /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2&gt;&amp;1 0 18 * * 1-5 /usr/local/bin/defaultbrowser -set safari &gt;&gt; /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; echo $(date) &gt;&gt; /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2&gt;&amp;1 /code/pre  Now my browser will change at 9 am and 6pm on weekdays.     strongExplanation:/strong   codeEDITOR=NANO crontab -e/code edits the crontab filebr code0 9 * * 1-5/code means on days 1-5 (monday - friday), run the following command at 9:00 code/usr/local/bin/defaultbrowswer -set chrome/code sets the default browserbr code&gt;&gt; /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log/code appends to a file I call defaultbrowser.log in my home directorybr code2&gt;&amp;1/code fancy syntax that sends both errors, and logs to the same placebr code&amp;&amp;/code combines two commands into 1br codeecho $(date) &gt;&gt; /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2&gt;&amp;1/code Adds a timestamp to the log file  I had some problems creating the cronjob, I had to use nano based on this information.   Also, this could have been rewritten using launchd, however cron was easier.   <answer144904> Not nearly as complicated, but perhaps of value, is the app Choosy. It allows you to choose your browser every time you open a link emoutside/em of a browser. While this might sound onerous, it's actually pretty transparent, and I find it very useful in the leadup to going live with a new web project and testing in multiple browsers over and over and overâ€¦  Might suit the bill if one added keystroke isn't a problem. Of course, once you're inside Safari, links clicked will open in Safari (although there's even a way to modify this behavior.)  FWIW.  h2Choosy/h2  <comment170323> Do You have Xcode to recompile some sources? <comment170334> You can just switch it in Safari preferences. <comment170342> I'm looking for an automated solution that does not require clicking buttons. <comment170352> Check the comments for [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17528688/set-default-web-browser-via-command-line). A user build his own app to do just that. You could launch it with a bit of script code. It appears to be for 10.9, will not run on my 10.6 :( HTH <comment170431> How do you set it to specific times? <comment170487> I'd compile "defaultbrowser" from sources with addition to handle *https* prefix as well. Right now it handles only *http*. That's why I've asked, if You can compile things in Xcode... <comment170687> Yes you're right. I updated my answer with the changes needed and it seems to work ok for both cases now. <comment170688> You don't, see edit. I would use a event based scheduler instead. <comment170689> +1, but I'd change the logic in `if(s == ...` statement. I know this should not happen to be able to change only one of http/https, but You never know ;) <comment348659> I was surprised to see `EDITOR=NANO` actually works, but of course, the macOS default filesystem ignores file name case.  You might prefer a different editor than `nano` even if you are a beginner. <comment348662> See the link in the answer. There is a bug/quirk when using vim to edit cron on OSX. Nano is not affected.
