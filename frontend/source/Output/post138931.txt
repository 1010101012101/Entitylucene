What is the correct way to install python on OS X? <body> Im learning python programming, what is the correct way to install python on Mavericks 10.9?. Is it correct just to download the installer or use homebrew instead to install python?.  <answer138934> OS X Mavericks actually ships with Python in code/usr/bin/python/code:  precode|ruby-2.1.1| mymachine in ~ ○ → /usr/bin/python --version Python 2.7.5 /code/pre  You don't need to install Python at all to get started developing with Python on OS X. That version is sufficiently high enough to be useful for Python 2.x development work and not totally suck (i.e. it's not Python 2.4).  My personal preference to is to use Homebrew for installing command line tools. You get a nice, neat, compartmentalized installation that's fairly straightforward to wipe away if it bothers you. So, I would use Homebrew to install a newer version of Python if I wanted it.  To install Python with Homebrew first install Homebrew:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  And then install Python 2.7.8 with:  precodebrew install python /code/pre  As you can see, this is the 2.7.8 version of Python:  precode|ruby-2.1.1| mymachine in ~ ○ → brew info python python: stable 2.7.8 (bottled), HEAD http://www.python.org /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.6_1 (4976 files, 81M) *   Poured from bottle From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/python.rb /code/pre  If you'd also like Python 3.4.1 you can use:  precodebrew install python3 /code/pre  Which you can see gives you:  precode|ruby-2.1.1| mymachine in ~ ○ → brew info python3 python3: stable 3.4.1 (bottled), HEAD https://www.python.org/ Not installed From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/python3.rb /code/pre  Homebrew will install any dependencies you need to run Python in either case.  <answer248337> Download the source code like codePython-3.4.1.tgz/code or whatever version you are looking for from Python official website and extract it:  precodetar -xzf Python-3.4.1.tgz cd Python-3.4.1 ./configure make make test sudo make install /code/pre  Installing from source code can be done in other platforms like Linux.  Verify the installation by:  precodebash-4.3$ python Python 3.4.1 (default, Aug  4 2016, 13:53:56) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.31)] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. /code/pre  <comment163898> I need to install python 2.7.8. So do you recommend me to install it with homebrew?, Why?. <comment163899> Yes. Use Homebrew. <comment163900> But if i use brew install python how to specify python 2.7.8 version? <comment163901> You get the latest 2.7.x by default. I'll update the post with details in a bit. <comment163902> But the latest is Python 3.4.1, how to install the 2.7.8 version? <comment163909> See answer. The `python`package in Homebrew *is* Python 2.7.8. <comment307645> @anon see my answer <comment307664> Do you ever confirm the validity of a tar archive with a hash supplied by developer? Or, read the INSTALL and README's  within the extracted archive? Or, use `./configure -h` to see what your install options are? <comment307673> I installed the tar off python website <comment307741> Why not the compiled version from the same place? <comment307781> if you are talking about the dmg it doesn't work on El Capitan. I have written a question that explains that http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/248330/installing-python3-4-1-on-osx-el-capitan
