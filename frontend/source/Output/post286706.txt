Push calendar events from iPhone 6 to Exchange calendar <body> Trying to push calendar events from iPhone 6 to exchange calendar in Outlook desktop. Events on desktop push to phone but not the other way around. I tried deleting and re-adding the account and making sure calendar sync is selected under accounts, but no luck. Any ideas?  <comment361820> Questions about mobile phones are offtopic here on SuperUser, but you likely need to change the default calendar to the one you use in outlook before it will start working. <comment361833> What LPChip said (to the best of my knowledge). Try setting the default calendar on the iPhone to the Exchange calendar and try again.
