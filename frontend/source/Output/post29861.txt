How do I change my (non-interactive shell) PATH? <body> For example, when I launch Emacs from the terminal (an interactive shell), I can use "M-x shell".  When I launch Emacs from the dock (which spawns process from some other shell), I cannot, because "grep isn't found" (or 'ls' or 'some other universal UNIX command'). Also, half my non-default applications have stopped working (MATLAB, DrRacket, X11, etc).  ol liHow do I change the environment of the shell that is called by the dock?/li liWhat shell does the dock call / what else ought I know about different shells on a mac?/li /ol  <answer29863> You should create the file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist with inside  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;PATH&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;/Users/gio/.dotfiles/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/sbin&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;/Users/gio/.local:/Users/gio/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  What I wrote above is just an example, but I think you get the main point here. After you create the file, log out, log in, and you should be all set. You could have a ruby path as well, etc.  <comment34360> thanks! what does each component of "!DOCTYPE ...  do? that is: plist, PUBLIC, "-//Apple//..." and "http://www.apple.com/..." <comment34361> also, "2. What shell does the dock call / what else ought I know about different shells on a mac?" <comment34385> The first three lines are meant to identify plist. As for the different shells: every program not called from the terminal, use the environment variables specified above. Every program called from the terminal, use the variables specified in .bashrc/.profile/.zshrc etc.
