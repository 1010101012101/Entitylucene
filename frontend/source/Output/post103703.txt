Dock or launchpad not working <body> I dont know why i cliked on a broke image maybe to change my wallpaper and suddenly the wallpaper turn gray and my dock has disappeared, I cannot use my launchpad either, please help!  <comment122043> Your wallpaper turned gray - is it a textured gray (that looks a little bit like cloth)? Also, does anything else appear on the desktop? Icons? Anything other than the gray background? Oh, and is your menu bar there at the top? <comment122051> Not likely a virus, @Buscar. More likely corrupted files or a permissions issue. Alexandra, also let us know more about your computer - what kind is it, are you using a monitor, and if so, how is it connected, etc. We need a bit more information in order to help you. <comment122053> What image? can you restart ? <comment122064> It sounds like you are running something in full screen mode (that is hiding your dock). try the esc, or cmd -, or cmd+Tab!
