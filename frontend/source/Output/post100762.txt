Proxy setup to install Mountain Lion <body> On my work place and at home I have networks using a proxy. For security reasons (it is correctly filtering most form of web based attacks), I don't want to remove it or to modify an healthy network architecture. hr On Lion, it was possible to correctly install or recover MacOS X with the following receipe.  I'm actually using the wireless network to reach the Internet through my web proxy. My web proxy IP address is:   precode10.0.0.1 /code/pre  The port used to access web proxy in this case is:  precode3128 /code/pre  Commands entered within the menu codeUtilities &gt; Terminal/code:  precodenetworksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi 10.0.0.1 3128 off networksetup -setsecurewebproxy Wi-Fi 10.0.0.1 3128 off /code/pre  The codeoff/code argument means no proxy authentication needed. hr Unfortunately, on codeMountain Lion/code, this setting isn't working.  If I start codeSafari/code from the Installer (with the Installer Help Utility), I notice that any web access is going through the proxy, but it is limited to Google locations services. Something as simple as:  precodehttp://www.apple.com /code/pre  doesn't go through the proxy.  I know easy workaround, but I would like to stay on a secure network for things as important as a fresh OS install.  I'm looking for further analysis of what may be blocking this codenormal/code network access specific to codeMountain Lion/code installer.
