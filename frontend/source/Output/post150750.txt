Cannot play videos in my iPad Air after upgrading to iOS 8.0.2 <body> After upgrading my iPad Air to iOS 8.0.2 I can no longer play videos in any application.  I've tried playing videos in Safari, Youtube, MVP Video Playlist, and any other app you can think of and nothing, I even tried playing purchased videos from iTunes in Apple's own Videos app and it just doesn't work.
