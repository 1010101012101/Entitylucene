How to disable iPhone notifications from Facebook Places? <body> I've got this long-running annoyance about the Facebook iPhone app.   Now, I strongdo/strong want notifications from Facebook e.g. when someone posts on my wall/timeline or mentions me in a comment.  However, every now and again, some of my friends check in (or whatever it's technically called) somewhere with Facebook, and I get a big alert about it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ue8TL.png" alt="enter image description here"  I most certainly do not want emthese/em notifications! And I don't really follow why Facebook considers someone's random check-in an event that emI/em should be notified about.   Question is, stronghow can I disable these/strongâ€”or all Facebook Places related notifications, while at it? Are there any settings on the Facebook website related to this?  sI'm asking at Webapps SE, and not e.g. Apple SE, because/s I'm pretty sure the iPhone app doesn't have any related settings. The only FB notification setting I see is this one:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3Kgu.png" alt="enter image description here"  (...and as said, I wouldn't want to turn off emall/em FB notifications.)  <answer50748> Turns out I was wrong; you emcan/em configure this on iPhone.  As strongthe guide on this page/strong taught me:  ol liOpen Settings/li liScroll down to the application list and select Facebook/li liChoose Push Notifications /li /ol  Now, in my case it was probably strongNearby Friends/strong that I mostly wanted to disable. I ended up turning off some others too:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ldCTn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer79576> This has been driving me crazy because the notifications show up in the web browser Facebook, but the settings can only be accessed and turned off from the Facebook iOS app.   Note that the Facebook app has a new UI and that these settings are now inside the iOS app. I already had all Facebook iOS notifications off.   Even worse, Facebook's notion of what's nearby makes no sense for an urban area. 15 miles away, across the bridge, who cares? Stop notifying me.  Thanks.  <answer80092> here is how to remove it : go to your facebook on your phone; slide to the right so you can see newsfeed, messages, etc etc , go to Account Setting, then go to Notifications, then go to Mobile Push, then uncheck NEARBY FRIENDS.......There you have it !!!  <comment58140> Once again, [rubber-ducking](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html) with Stack Exchange got the problem solved. :) <comment91867> Hmm, I too recently saw one of these notifications *in the normal Facebook web UI*... So do you know any way to turn those off, or are you basically asking a follow-up question? <comment93324> that didnt work I already had neaby friends unchecked
