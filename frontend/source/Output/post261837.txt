How do I control which port lockd (NFS) uses? <body> I have a Linux file server running NFS that is behind a firewall.  As such the server is configured to run mountd and lockd on a specific ports (4040 and 4041 respectively). I have multiple Linux clients that mount the share from the file server and read/write to it successfully.  I also have a single Mac Pro (running Mac OS 10.11.6) that needs to mount the NFS share.  The Mac can mount and read from the share just fine, however writes to the share hang (i.e. "Preparing to copy file..." but never actually copies the file).  If I temporarily disable the firewall then the Mac can write successfully.  I enabled logging on the server and noticed that lockd requests coming from the Mac client are happening on random ports and not on port 4041.  After a little research I discovered that it should be possible to fix the client lockd port by setting the codenfs.lockd.port/code option in the code/etc/nfs.conf/code file.  I set the option as follows on the Mac client:  precodenfs.lockd.port = 4041 /code/pre  After disconnecting and reconnecting to the share I still see lockd requests coming in on random ports in the server log.  I rebooted the Mac (and double checked to make sure the option is still set in code/etc/nfs.conf/code), reconnected to the share and I still see lockd requests coming in on random ports and writes hanging. Again I temporarily disabled the firewall and suddenly the Mac can write files just fine.  Note the that Mac OS firewall is disabled on the client.  Any suggestions?  How do I force lockd on the NFS client side to actually use the port I've specified?
