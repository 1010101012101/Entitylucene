Macbook Pro 2009 - SSD Upgrade - White Screen <body> Recommended my girlfriend's dad to upgrade his laptop with an SSD to improve loading times etc. I'd done this to her laptop (2012) and all worked no problem. Formatted the drive, carbon copy cloned, plugged it in and all was well.  I've tried to do the same thing with the mid 2009 Macbook Pro 17", so formatted, cloned and plugged it in. On boot however I get the (dvd drive?) click, chime and then just a white screen and nothing loads. I held the option button on startup and a mouse appeared which I could control but nothing loaded.   Can anyone advise?  It's running 10.6.8  Thanks
