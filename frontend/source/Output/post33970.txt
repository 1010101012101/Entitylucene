Setting time format preference in unix (Mac-Terminal) <body> I'm learning to work in unix using Terminal on a Mac and I'd like to set the default listing for the timestamp to display in 12 hour time, using AM and PM, instead of 24 hour time (ie: 1:00 PM, not 13:00). I'm somewhat familiar with setting preferences, so to speak, using the code~/.bashrc/code file, where I've set a couple of aliases, including one with the options for my preferred codels/code display. I've looked at the man pages and elsewhere online, but I haven't had any luck finding what I'm looking for time-wise though. Any suggestions would be appreciated.    <answer33971> The Mac OS terminal uses a bash shell. The prompt is controlled by the codePS1/code environment variable described more here. Try this for example.  precodeexport PS1='\t$ ' /code/pre  It will give you a prompt looking something like this  precode19:40:14$  /code/pre  <answer33972> to get 12:00 AM/PM use  precode  export PS='\@' /code/pre  I hope this helps.

You could create a shell alias to display the date using a custom format.  If you're referring to the time format used by 'ls', I don't believe there is any way to change that.  <answer37077> Using GNU ls, on Linux, there is a code--time-style/code flag you can use to specify one of a few pre-defined time types, or specifying a completely custom code+FORMAT/code style like the codedate/code command accepts. However, BSD ls, which Apple ships, does not support this flag.  I've seen similar discrepancies in commands like codedate/code and codetar/code as well, all rooted in the differences between the GNU and BSD variants.  <comment38820> This didn't seem to do anything (at least not that I'm aware of) but thanks for the suggestion <comment38821> This didn't accomplish what I was trying to do, however it tipped me off to how I could customize the prompt (I'm not sure if that's what it's called) which is something I wanted to do, but wasn't going to hassle about. I came up with a partial answer by way of a video tutorial and through a concentrated look at the man pages for strftime. I'll start a new post to try to make my rephrasing of the question more useful to the community. Thanks~B <comment38822> Actually, I changed my mind; this is probably the appropriate place to post, so I'll continue with a bit of extra space...br/  /br/ In the tutorial I mentioned above, there was information about configuring <comment38824> Oi... this is getting to be a pain. I overshot my time for editing the last mistake (over 5 minutes). I'm not really getting the formatting on here and my patience for fussing with it at the moment has worn out. I'll give it a rest for now... <comment42242> Thanks, you may be right about ls. I was able to customize the history format using the HISTTIMEFORMAT environment variable. HISTTIMEFORMAT='%b %d %I:%M:%S %p ' formats the date to show as: Jan 17 12:00:00 PM. I opted not to include the year for practical purposes, since it's just history, but I don't see any sort of straightforward way to format the string for time globally. Probably something with TZ, but that looks a bit more complicated than I can figure out at the moment. ~B <comment46252> You mean you want to set the time format on a UNIX global level so that all commands and output displays the time as per your format of choice? <comment46339> Yes, that sums up what I'd like to do. <comment167008> I wish I knew a way to format `ls` datetimes (I'd rather see ISO-8601). Apple's BSD manual for `ls` seems to offer nothing for formatting datetimes, other than changing timezone and sorting by datetime rather than alpha. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ls.1.html
