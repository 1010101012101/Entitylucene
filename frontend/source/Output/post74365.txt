installed amarok through macports - no playback <body> I installed amarok through macport. It doesn't playback the mp3's (actually it doesn't playback anything).  I looked at the console and it says among other things  code.... [0x0-0x2b02b].org.kde.amarok[35766]   com.apple.console   WARNING: bool Phonon::FactoryPrivate::createBackend() phonon backend plugin could not be loaded/code  Any idea?  <answer108438> I know this is not a satisfactory answer, but at the moment, phonon seems to be non-functional when installed from MacPorts.
