How to access Journals from iCloud.com <body> Is there a way to access Journals publish by iOS iPhoto, directly from icloud.com, without knowing the link already.  Currently I have to "share the link with a friend" before I can access it on icloud.com, even though I have already synced it to icloud.  <answer46263> There is no way to directly access your Journals from iCloud.com, no. However, if you publish a Journal you can choose "Add to Home Page" (iPad and iPhone), that way if you have multiple Journals a visitor can navigate to your "Home Page".  A visitor would still need the unique link for at least one Journal even with that option selected. Alas, there is no "icloud.com/emuser/em/" link one could visit directly.  I don't think it's designed to be a landing page. It's more to generate a unique link for sharing said Journal.
