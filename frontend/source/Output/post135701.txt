how can I protect the private data on my Iphone? <body> what is the best way to secure data on my iphone?  In my opinion I have to protect myself against the following risks:  ul litheft/li lifault and phone must be returned/li /ul  I fear for the following data  ul liLogins to email, dorpbox, calender, .../li limails, photos, chat history, .../li /ul  The phone is allways locked, but with hardware access it might be possible to read the data...   <answer135702> Take the following steps as there is no one sure shot way to get the protection that will actually protect you (at-least to some extent):  ol listrongEnable data Encryption/strong on your device, even if someone is able to gain access to your data on the phone memory, there will be a layer of protection./li listrongApple/Google provide web management/strong device utilities which gives ability for remote locking, remotely wiping data, changing passwords etc, check out those settings. Some third-party app provide for this as well./li lidon't install apps from outside the app store./li listrongsetup secure passwords and locks/strong (stronguse numbers lower-case, upper-case, symbols/strong etc, you may even stronguse special characters/strong that are not directly available on the keyboard)/li listrongchange your passwords often,/strong maybe every 6 months atleast./li listrongEnable 2-step authentication./strong emPROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THING YOU COULD DO RIGHT NOW./em Most leading service providers, DropBox, Gmail (and other google services), Evernote provide this option. then you need two bits of information to access your account:  ul lione, the information you know, your password./li lisecond, the information you get (through an SMS/Email)./li /ul/li listrongProvide an option for recovery,/strong such as secondary mail/ contact number in case you forget your password./li likeep a track of security holes such as the recent Heartbleed bug./li liwhen some one uses your phone to make a call/text, be close and it might be a good idea to take his/her picture (you don't know whome he/she might be calling to, maybe some terrorist?)/li liyou may even want to strongsubscribe for sms updates/strong for your  facebook, twitter and google+  etc notifications for any suspicious  activities in real time./li /ol  <answer135885> so after googeling around based on the suggestions above, I am faced with the following situation:  Parts of my data are encrpyted by default with apple passcode but most of it is not encrypted:  ul lifotos/li lichat history form skype, facebook/li liE-Mail and SMS/li /ul  A small possibility is to remote wipe the phone, if it has not previously jailbreaked or opened...  <comment160863> The number one rule: don't put your sensitive data on it in the first place. My phone has a few phone numbers and that's it. No mail, no sensitive documents, no passwords, etc. I even avoid the various stores so I don't have to enter a password that's automagically saved. I do store downloads on a laptop or MacBook and then transfer to the device. <comment160864> agreed but that's not an easy choice to make, not always. <comment160865> "Enable data Encryption" - not very helpful when folks like Apple provides no protection over important passwords and other secrets (i.e., `ï¿¼kSecAttrAccessible=all`, which means its always available - even without a login). The passwords include VPN, LDAP, and email password. See, for example, [iOS Keychain Weakness FAQ](https://www.sit.fraunhofer.de/fileadmin/dokumente/sonstiges/iPhone_keychain_faq.pdf). <comment160866> Then such people better not use apple. ;-) <comment160867> Yeah, its not just Apple - its all of them. Don't fall into the trap of thinking a mobile device or tablet is like a laptop with full disk encryption ;) <comment160871> is data Encryption on Iphone enabled with Passcode or is it necessary to enabled "Erase Data" - below this setting the iphone shows text that "data protection is enabled"?
