Headphones not working even when detected <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gnlei.jpg" alt="enter image description here"Not output from headphones even when the system detects them. Interestingly speakers work fine on the system.  I checked headphones for any hardware failure; it works fine on other systems.  I tried resetting NVRAM and SMC but no luck.  MacBook Air early 2014, macOS Sierra 10.12.5  Any suggestion?  EDIT:  ol liI've added the pics of both external speaker port (Left) and headphone port(Right)/li liHeadphone model audio technica ATH-S100/li liHeadphones used to work fine on my system, it stopped working abruptly from last couple of weeks./li /ol  <comment363586> When you say "speakers" do you mean the *internal* (built-in) or *external* speakers? <comment363742> both, internal as well external speakers <comment363751> To clarify - your headphones work when plugged into any other computer, but not on your Mac.  When you plug external speakers into the same audio jack, the speakers work.  Correct?  Can you post a photo of the 3.5mm phono plug from the headset and the speaker.  I'm wondering if there's any difference.  Also, what make/model headphones are they? <comment363938> yeah, correct.
