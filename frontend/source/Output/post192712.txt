White Noise when exit from 3D games in bootcamp <body> I am using macbook air 2014 and installed the windows 7 64 bit using bootcamp.  Right now I am using the thunderbolt (mini-display) to hdmi convert-or and hdmi cable.  I use steam to play game and there is a problem after I exit from 3d games. The screen will turn white noise and I need to plug the cable again several time until return to normal screen.  The quality of the cable is not the main reason as in mac it works without any flaws, I  used the PNY convertor and the amazon basic hdmi cable so it should be ok.  Thanks for helping  <comment229409> Basic HDMI cable is very good for basic stuff, but not for high bandwidth AV transmissions. <comment229411> @Buscarì›ƒSD It isn't a "basic cable", it's an Amazon Basics cable (I'd assume). Their cables are pretty good in my experience. <comment229421> Which connection do you have to Plug/Unplug, The Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt to HDMI or HDMI, to check if a bad connection exists in one of them <comment229462> Either, but I assume that is not related to the hardware as it works perfectly in mac os <comment229463> Yes , it is " Amazon Basics cable " the quality is good
