Can't type after switching Screens 10.6.8 <body> Whenever my screen switches focus (i.e., to another dekstop) using a keyboard shortcut, the little N-screen window stays up and the machine no longer accepts any input emexcept/em for screen-switching.  The only way I can get keyboard input to be accepted again is by ssh'ing in to the machine and doing codekillall Dock/code.    Any ideas how I can fix this more permanently?  <comment114802> Strangely, this problem just disappeared on its own eventually... <comment115012> It also came back on its own.  Curious.
