Saving to a SMB share with Chrome creates files of zero bytes (that can't be opened) <body> We are having difficulty with some save operations over an SMB share. The issue has been occurring between OSX versions; we just upgraded to the latest OS X "Mavericks", and the issue hasn't gone away.  h1Steps to reproduce:/h1  ol liIn Chrome, right-click an image and click "save as"/li liSave the file to a network share/li liThe file is created, but the properties indicate that it is "zero bytes" and it cannot be opened/li /ol  h1Observations/h1  ul liInvestigation of the file on the network share shows that it was created and does, indeed, take up space/li liViewing file permissions as an Administrator brings up the message indicating that the Admin doesn't have access to be able to view file permissions/li liAfter taking ownership of the file, an unknown user is displayed in the security tab with no permissions to the file/li licodecacles.exe filename/code yields the following: code&lt;Account Domain not found&gt;&lt;DENY&gt;&lt;special access:&gt;/code/li liSaving does work with Safari and Firefox/li /ul  Is anyone else having this issue? I'm looking for either a solution or a specific bug report I can follow (This appears to be a hard topic to search for online due to Chromes use of "network" in this instance).
