Unable to flip a clip horizontally in iMovie 10.1.6 <body> I'm running iMovie 10.1.6 on MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 on a brand new, 2017 MacBook Air.  I have a clip which I want to flip/invert horzontally so that writing which currently appears with writing in reverse, so it is unreadable.  I've read up a lot online and everything I find says I should select the clip, click on the icon above the clip preview which is like 3 overlapping circles and then select Video Effect and choose Flipped.  However, when I click on the 3 circles icon, there is no Video Effects option shown, only Clip Filter and Audio Effect, so I don't know how to get this done.  I'm tearing my hair out at this and would really appreciate some help from anyone who can solve my problem. I know I don't have much rep here - I wish I could put a big bounty on this question because it's driving me nuts!  <answer295774> If I understand your question correctly, you can do what you want as follows:  ol liSelect the clip/li liClick on the icon you called the 3 overlapping circles/li liClick on the Clip Filter option/li liIn the emChoose Clip Filter/em window that appears, select the strongFlipped/strong filter/li liThis will now film your clip horizontally/li /ol  I've created a visual diagram of steps 2 - 4  below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/99tMb.png" alt="enter image description here"
