Loopback address 127.0.0.1 not accessible, but localhost and ::1 are <body> In trying to make Pow work, which uses 127.0.0.1, I noticed the IP doesn't resolve to localhost. On OS X 10.11 El Capitan.  So I have a Rails app running on port 5000,   ul licodelocalhost:5000/code works/li licode[::1]:5000/code works/li licode127.0.0.1:5000/code doesn't/li /ul  I've read some questions about an Apache setup; one where it's the reverse with localhost not working.  I've seen that I could disable IPv6 somewhere, but I don't really want to disable IPv6.  What is going on?  <comment331613> Yep, the matter is not with OS X but rather with the app not binding to `127.0.0.1`. \[obsolete]
