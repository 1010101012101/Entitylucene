Client side certificates <body> I'm trying to set up a site to require client-side certificates for authentication. However when I browse to the site, the only certificates I'm able to present to the webserver are those listed in the "My Certificates" section of my keychain. My certificate is just in the "Certificates" section. How do I get the cert into the correct location? The + icon is grayed out under "My Certificates"...
