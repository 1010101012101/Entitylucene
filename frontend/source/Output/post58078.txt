How do I get my user directory working for web sharing again? <body> I had web sharing enabled in Lion and a web site at codehttp://localhost/~user/code, where codeuser/code is my User directory.  When I upgraded to Mountain Lion, web sharing (Apache) remained enabled and I can go to localhost and get the "It works!" default web page, but I cannot access my user page anymore.  The error is      Forbidden      You don't have permission to access /~user/ on this server.   How do I re-enable my user directory's web page?  <answer58083> See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/57555/9058, basically you have to enable per-user web sharing manually (with Terminal.app).  <answer58176> Mountain Lion removes the configuration file that gives web access to your user directory.  The configuration files are in code/etc/apache2/users//code.  The missing one is codeuser.conf/code, where user is your short username.  If you don't want to fiddle with the command line, here's an Applescript you can run to create a configuration file for your user.  It will ask for your password because it has to create the file in a system-level directory and needs elevated privileges.  In your applications folder or Launchpad, open codeOther &gt; Applescript Editor/code.  Copy the script below and paste it into the text area of the Applescript editor.  Then click the strongRun/strong button.  precodeset userHome to (short user name of (system info)) set configFile to "/etc/apache2/users/" &amp; userHome &amp; ".conf" set configFileContents to "&lt;Directory \"/Users/" &amp; userHome &amp; "/Sites/\"&gt;     Options Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt;"  do shell script "echo '" &amp; configFileContents &amp; "' &gt; " &amp; configFile with administrator privileges do shell script "/usr/sbin/apachectl restart" with administrator privileges /code/pre  When the script finishes, you should be able to access your user-level web page.  <answer58183> Here is how you can re-enable the web page with the command line using Terminal.  First copy this and paste it into Terminal.  You may have to press kbdenter/kbd after pasting to run it.  It will ask for your password because it is adding a file to your system directory.  precodeUSER_DIR=$(basename $(echo ~)) sudo bash -c "cat &gt; /etc/apache2/users/$USER_DIR.conf" &lt;&lt;TEXT &lt;Directory "/Users/$USER_DIR/Sites"&gt;      Options Indexes MultiViews      AllowOverride None      Order allow,deny      Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; TEXT /code/pre  Then run this command to restart the web server:  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  <answer76919> I had to add codeFollowSymLinks/code as follows to my code/etc/apache2/users/username.conf/code :   precode&lt;Directory "/Users/username/Sites/"&gt; Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks AllowOverride None Order deny,allow Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  (codeusername/code has to be replaced by your real username)   <comment66924> Sorry, my mistake, you need it for the name of the conf file as well. Nevertheless, $(basename ~) should work as well <comment89420> I did something slightly different than this.  Thanks indiv for the info that helped me create a custom solution for my setup.  I added the "Directory" block you have to /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf with a "*" in place of "$USER_DIR".  This enables user directories for all users that have a "Sites" directory.
