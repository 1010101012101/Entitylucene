Efficient compression workflow of iCloud Videos <body> Photos for Mac + iCloud Photos has significantly improved my photography workflow: It is now much easier to keep all of my family photos and videos organized (side bar: favorite smart album is album = none).  With 140 GB in my photo library already though (on the 200 GB plan), I try to save space where I can. Compressing my iPhone 6+ videos is one area that I hope to improve upon. I usually record in 30fps on the phone and use Compressor's Apple Device (Best Quality) export/transcode option to convert the videos.  The process is slightly cumbersome though:  ol liExport the video from Photos for Mac/li liCompress the video with Compressor/li liAdd it back to Photos for Mac/li liFinally correct the EXIF date/time manually./li /ol  Does anyone have a more efficient workflow to accomplish this objective (possibly using Automator)?
