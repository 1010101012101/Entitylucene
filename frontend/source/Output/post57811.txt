Mountain Lion installer doesnt start after reboot <body> I am currently trying to install Mountain Lion and everything was going fine until it was time to reboot.   First I tried rebooting then it said i needed to close applications so I clicked the button to close applications and it hung for a few minutes then the installer crashed so I ran the installer again as it didnt restart on its own after clicking reopen application.br The installer immediately gave me the restart button as im assuming the file caching process was completed. Now, whenever I click the restart button it just restarts my macbook and the installer never kicks in. I've done this around 4-5 times now exact same thing each time.  I'm not sure if there are corrupt files in the installer cache or its sending the wrong reboot message but i havent been able to install it one way or another. any ideas?  strongEdit:/strong  did a disk repair and permissions repair and turned off file vault still have same issues   the installer log after installation failed   precodeJul 28 04:00:04 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: opendirectoryd (build 197.11.16) launched - installer mode Jul 28 04:00:04 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: Logging level limit changed to 'notice' Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: Initialize trigger support Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: created endpoint for mach service 'com.apple.private.opendirectoryd.rpc' with work limit 10 Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: set default handler for RPC 'reset_cache' Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: set default handler for RPC 'reset_statistics' Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: set default handler for RPC 'show' Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: starting endpoint for service 'com.apple.private.opendirectoryd.rpc' Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: no dynamic data found at '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/DynamicData/Configure.plist' Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: Registered node with name '/Configure' as hidden Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: no dynamic data found at '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/DynamicData/Local.plist' Jul 28 04:00:05 localhost opendirectoryd[101]: Registered node with name '/Local' as hidden Jul 28 04:00:09 localhost Unknown[312]: kern.boottime: { sec = 1343473200, usec = 0 } Sat Jul 28 04:00:00 2012 Jul 28 04:00:09 localhost Unknown[320]: Launching the Language Chooser for an OS Install Jul 28 04:00:16 localhost Unknown[322]: 2012-07-28 04:00:16.231 LCA[321:707] NSSoftLinking - The Librarian framework's library couldn't be loaded from (null).

Also, you might have a look in the Startup Disk preference pane and switch that setting around before trying the installer again. <comment66836> the installer doesn't start after reboot so i dont get the installer console and when i try to load the installer from a usb disk it just says installation failed try reinstalling as soon as it loads and i checked the startup disk it gives me windows and mac os options and mac osx is selected <comment66859> That last bit of information probably need to be added to your question.  Boot camp is involved and that changes the question. <comment66982> sorry for that i didnt realize th bootcamp was that big of an issue with installs as i have never had issues with this in the past ill make sure i mention that in the future
