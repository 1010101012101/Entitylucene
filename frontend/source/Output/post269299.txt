Empty iCloud mail folder still contains .emlx files <body> My iCloud mail contains a folder that is empty in both my Apple Mail client (Mail.app) and the web version of iCloud mail. Both seem to think there are no mail files. The folder is called "Transfer"  The trouble is that code~/Library/Mail/V4/&lt;long uuid&gt;/Tranfer.mbox/code contains .emlx files. Rebuilding the directory does nothing to make them visible from inside Mail.app.  Exporting the folder results in an empty .mbox file even though the directory Transfer.mbox contains files.  Is there a more aggressive way to rebuild the folder so these files are recognized?  An alternative email client also doesn't seem to help either. When I connect to iCloud mail with Thunderbird the folder doesn't even show up.
