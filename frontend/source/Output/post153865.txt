Can I separate Facetime audio from system audio? <body> I have an iPhone 6 and MBP on OSX Yosemite.  The new feature in OSX allowing me to take a call through my MBP is fantastic, but it's less practical than it could be because of how long it takes to switch the audio input/output settings to my headset.  The sequence goes like this:  ol liMy normal audio settings have output through Cinema display, input through display (or built-in, whatever)/li liI'm listening to pandora/li liCall comes in.  Sweet!  I can use my headset!/li liHold down ‚å• and click the speaker icon in the menu bar/li liSelect output to go through my headset./li liRepeat #4/li liSelect input to come through my headset/li liStop pandora so it doesn't interfere with the phone call/li liAnswer call just in time to hear someone say "call me back" or just hang up/li liMake phone call on my phone, defeating the entire purpose/li /ol  Steps 4-9 take emway/em too long.  The Google Hangouts plugin does this right, as does Skype (IIRC).  Those steps:  ol liNormal audio settings/li liListening to pandora/li liCall comes in, I grab headset/li liI answer call, pandora is squelched somewhat, the headset is piped through to the call automatically/li /ol  The second set is what's desirable.  Is there a way to make Facetime on OSX do this?  <answer198264> Have you considered trying Sound Siphon or Audio Hijack Pro to control your audio?
