Can I use a security key such as YubiKey to sign into Google on Safari? <body> I have a YubiKey from Yubico which I would like to use in order to secure my online accounts.  When trying it with Google, it tells me that Safari does not support it, I have to use Chrome instead. Is there a way I can use it with Google when I use the Safari browser?  <answer266693> First, I assume you are using YubiKey 4 with U2F support.  Safari does not support U2F natively, but if you have Safari 10, you can add the plugin Safari-FIDO-U2F available from blahgeek on GitHub.  The author confirms that the plugin works with some of the websites (with some hacking required to show up to the server as Chrome):     ul   liGithub Account Two-factor authentication/li   liDropbox Account Security/li   liFastmail/li   /ul   but also warns it does not work with Google Account (although it does with Google's demo site).  So for now the answer is you cannot use U2F to login to Google, but it might change in future.  <comment334385> Have you set up two factor authentication with Google services? <comment334386> Are you looking for official vendor support from yubikey to say they either have made and released or have not made and released a Safari plug in? (Or perhaps are you looking for a go-between like LastPass which would bridge the two?) <comment334399> @IconDaemon I have two factor authentication set up using Google Authentorcator, however I would like to use my Yubico Key as well. <comment334401> @bmike I would like any 'secure' method which would allow me to use it with Google in Safari.
