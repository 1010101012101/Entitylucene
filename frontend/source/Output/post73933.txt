How to run .exe files on Mac without virtual machine? <body> I do have one software(.exe) file which I need to run on my macbook pro. For that I need cross platform application just like wine in Ubuntu.  Can anyone suggest me the application?  <answer73937> There is a wine port for OS X: http://wiki.winehq.org/MacOSX  From the project page:     strongCurrent Status (x86)/strong      Wine works well on OSX for Intel based Macs minus a proper   distribution package (Mac Application Bundle) to fully integrate with   "drag and drop" and "open" or "open with" functionality. Wine also has   shortcomings with desktop icon integration and execution of certain   types of DOS or blended Windows/DOS programs.   (Notice that strongDarwine/strong, the original effort to port Wine to OS X, was primarily written for PowerPC Macs. Some work was done to support Intel Macs, but it is no longer actively developed, so you are better off avoiding it.)  There are no official Wine packages available for Intel Macs as of this writing, so you'll have to use a third-party application like strongWineBottler/strong (http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/), strongPlayOnMac/strong (http://www.playonmac.com/en/download.html, for Snow Leopard and Lion). or strongWineskin/strong (http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php, for Lion and Mountain Lion).  emdaviewales/em has mentioned in a comment below a package manager I didn't know of called strongHomebrew/strong (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). You may want to give it a try.  Otherwise you can try the commercial product strongCrossOver/strong, which is basically Wine with, as Wikipedia puts it, various compatibility patches added, more user-friendly configuration tools, and commercial support.  You can download a free trial here: http://www.codeweavers.com/products/  <answer73964> In addition to the other answer, take a look at WineBottler: http://winebottler.kronenberg.org  This application deals with some of the technical side of using wine on OSX, like creating application profiles etc. It essentially allows you to encapsulate the .exe as a mac application, and run it natively in OSX without the need for running a virtual machine.  It is only in beta, but I have successfully used this to run various windows .exe applications under OSX 10.6.x (Snow Leopard). Be warned, not everything will work, but that is to be expected!  Havent got round to testing it yet in Mountain Lion yet as I have only just migrated. Hope this helps!  <answer110981> Virtual machine would be another best option for you. have a look here also -  http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/software/3376910/how-open-exe-files-on-mac-os-x/  <comment85890> See [wineskin](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php) for a free wrapper to wine <comment85892> Hi Jaume, thanks for your quick response. I've tried Darwine already in my macbook but as I'm using Lion OS 10.7.4 and it doesn't support PowerPC Mac apps so I think it won't work on my mac. Please tell me if there is any way to resolve the issue or any other third party app. <comment85893> Wine will work on your Mac. The easiest way to install it is to first install homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) then open a terminal and type `brew install wine`, then `brew install winetricks`. Before you do that, however, you should search WineHQ (http://appdb.winehq.org/) to see whether your app works in Wine. <comment85894> Note that to run an exe in Wine, you have to open a terminal, change directory to the one containing the exe file (e.g. `cd ~/Downloads`) then run the exe by typing `wine ./filename.exe`. You can't just double click the exe file. <comment85897> @daviewa;es - it is even easier to use crossover or wineskin - the config is basically done for you <comment85898> But Wine is more fun... =P <comment86020> @Dhaval I don't understand why you mention PowerPC support and how it relates to your exe file. If you run Lion you have an Intel-based Mac, which is supported by Wine as stated in my answer. Furthermore, Apple dropped support for Rosetta in OS X 10.7 "Lion", which means that, as from this version, PowerPC applications won't run on an Intel-based Mac. <comment86153> @Jaume The reason is that I've tried the way you suggested but when I run the setup for that an alert is coming with message that "PowerPC is not supported by this application",what does that mean ? <comment86160> @Dhaval Now I understand. Darwine was primarily written for PowerPC Macs, and you have probably downloaded the PowerPC binary. Some work was done to support Intel-based Macs, but it seems that it is no longer actively developed, so I would avoid it. I think you're better off going for WineBottler (winebottler.kronenberg.org) or another third-party application mentioned in http://wiki.winehq.org/MacOSX#head-d4a2cb6359851f1e382111806a19df09899cec23. You can also give Homebrew (mxcl.github.com/homebrew) a try, as mentioned by daviewales above. I've expanded my answer to include this. <comment86166> @jaume Yes..Thanks your replies were really helpful. <comment86167> thanks for suggesting the winebottler but I'm already using this before your post :) though I'm respecting your help and giving up vote to your post..:) <comment130626> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment130631> There is of course CrossOver which I personally think is heavily overpriced and WinOnX, which I think is available on Mac AppStore for a lovely price. <comment130632> Also, it also depends on how the program (exe, executable) is written with, for example, programs that require .Net Framework or DirectX would require additional setup, like so in Linux. <comment172447> `wine` can also be installed via `macports`, by [`sudo port install wine`](https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/x11/wine/Portfile).
