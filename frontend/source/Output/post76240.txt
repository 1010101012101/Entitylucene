MacBook Pro and external monitor compatibility <body> I just bought my first Mac (to learn to build apps!). I have the June 2012 non-retina display 15 inch MacBook Pro. Does strongany/strong 16x10 aspect ratio montior technically work (monitor with VGA and DVI jacks)?  <answer76253> The Apple 15" MacBook Pro specification about Graphics and Video Support says:      Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native   resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up   to two external displays, at millions of colors Thunderbolt digital   video output      Native Mini DisplayPort output DVI output using Mini DisplayPort to   DVI Adapter (sold separately) VGA output using Mini DisplayPort to VGA   Adapter (sold separately) Dual-link DVI output using Mini DisplayPort   to Dual-Link DVI Adapter (sold separately)   <answer76285> I have a late 2011 15 inch MBP and have successfully used Thunderbolt adaptors to connect to monitors via DVI and TV via HDMI with excellent results. You don't need a 16:10 screen - the display will adapt to various screen dimensions.  I think you can plug just about anything in with a very high chance of success.  <comment88493> You will be hard pressed to find a monitor that will not work with the current thunderbolt ports. Since any Mini DisplayPort adapter will work you can start with VGA and work up to DVI/HDMI as well as other more exotic displays with more expensive adapters if needed.
