Disable Device Enollment Notification Window <body> I desire to disable the "Device Enrollment" notification window for OS X machines that are enrolled in DEP (Apple's Device Enrollment Program). The machines are running 10.11, though the process should be the same for 10.10.  (While we are currently managing iOS devices, we are not managing OS X devices through the enrollment program, and I do not want the pop-up to confuse or distract students.)  I have not found a way to disable to the pop-up, or where the setting is stored, once the user hits "Skip".  Does anyone know where this setting is stored, or perhaps how I can modify it using "defaults write" or something similar?  <answer216999> To disable enrollment pop-ups, I moved 2 files...  precode/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ManagedClientAgent.enrollagent.plist /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ManagedClient.enroll.plist /code/pre  to  precode/Library/LaunchAgentsDisabled and /Library/LaunchDaemonsDisabled /code/pre  Since I am using El Capitan, I am not "allowed" to modify the System folder. I did so by using Target Disk Mode and connecting to a Yosemite machine. You could also do so by disabling System Integrity Protection (instructions at http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/ )  <comment262306> I believe the LaunchAgent that controls this can be found at /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ManagedClientAgent.enrollagent.plist - However "System Integrity Protection" in El Capitan prevents me from disabling the service. Any ideas? <comment264562> moved those two files, but still getting this pop up. Any other files needed to be removed? <comment265072> I assumed you either restarted the machine or unloaded the LaunchAgent and LaunchDaemon? <comment274753> Will a reboot bring these back automatically? <comment274786> @KirkOuimet - No.  Launchd loads daemons from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons and from /Library/LaunchDaemons.  If the file is not there, it can not load it.  Please note that in El Capitan, you must disable or work around SIP in order to move these files. <comment274793> @TimDearborn you are a good man, thank you <comment333446> On macOS Sierra I couldn't find the files `/System/Library/Launch*/com.apple.ManagedClient*`. Where are they located on Sierra? <comment333467> @jfoliveira Sorry, I don't have a machine running Sierra at the moment. Will have to see if someone else responds. <comment343455> @jfoliveira , on Sierra those files are in the same locations, i tested it today and worked.
