ld: library not found for -lgcc <body> After a codebrew upgrade/code every time I try to compile a code.c/code file I get the following error:  codeld: library not found for -lgcc collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status/code  Wrappers like codempicc/code still work though. I tried relinking with codebrew link --overwrite gcc/code, but got no working results, as it is already linked. codebrew doctor/code doesn't give me a hint.  Thanks in advanced.  <answer243462> I'm not sure with it's like this, but if I compile with codegcc-4.9/code (as the gcc version I have instaled is version 4.9.2) instead of codegcc/code it works as it should. So the compilation sentence that seems to work is codegcc-4.9 -o exec_name program.c/code. If someone knows why it is like this I would be interested to know.  <comment299725> What is library gcc? What is the full line you are using to compile? .c files are compiled to .o and are not linked. Why use brew's gcc rather than Apple's clang? <comment299726> @Mark, just compiling a simple Hello World program with `gcc -o helloworld helloworld.c` fails and shows that error. <comment299727> Where is gcc i.e. what does `type -p gcc` show <comment299728> It's in /usr/local/bin/gcc <comment299734> See https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/40653 what version of Xcode do you have <comment299737> @Mark, according to `brew doctor` I have Xcode 7.2. It suggests me to update it to version 7.3.1. Still, gcc worked until yesterday and this suggestion has some days old.
