How do I combine two or more images to get a single pdf file? <body> Say I have some image files (for instance, the result of scanning some sheets) and I want to combine them into a single pdf file, each image on a different page.br Is there a faster / more convenient way than converting each one to a pdf file and then combining those (say, as explained here)? Or, if this is more or less how it is to be done, which is the most intelligent and less tedious possible way to do it?  <answer11165> Simple ... Open Preview, make sure the Drawer is open and Drag the Image in underneath the Page Thumbnail.**  Hope it helps  **I'm a noob sorry, only saw the link now, what so difficult in this method ?  <answer11169> Here are the steps to save multiple images in Preview into a single multi-page PDF.  ol liSelect all of the images you want in your PDF, right-click and choose open with Preview/li liIn Preview's Sidebar drag the images into the order you want them to appear in your PDF/li liSelect/highlight all the images to be included in the PDF document; otherwise only a emsingle/em image may end up the PDF document/li liThen from the "File" menu choose "Print Selected Images" (or "Print..." in recent OS X versions) and then "PDF  Save as PDF"/li /ol  <answer94020> paste in word and save as pdf...best possible way  <answer94023> I made 2 quick screenshots for you:  1) select thumbnails view:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6MVEl.png" alt="enter image description here"  2) Drag second PDF e.g., from Desktop, into thumbnails pane, but above the thin silver line where the red arrow is pointing at (otherwise it won't be saved). And then just save the PDF  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSP3q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment11679> The method in the link is the way to do it. <comment11680> Sorry, I was not clear. The link is about combining pdf files, and that is fine. What if I want to combine image files, and get a pdf as my result? Have I to convert them all into pdf files beforehand? <comment11681> Yes, this is what I tried too. Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but if I start with *image* files, I drop them one after another in the drawer, I select all and save as a pdf file, only one file ends up being saved in the pdf file I get. (Plus "what's so difficult in this method" is slightly patronising and not terribly helpful, if I may afford an opinion.) <comment11682> Yes, great! Thanks. <comment11683> I understand, as soon as the link is published on Vimeo ... I'll share it in the meantime: http://fischer.org.za/howto/MultipleImagestoPDF-iPhone.m4v <comment11699> Here's the Vimeo link :) http://vimeo.com/21771864 <comment11872> PDF's are known to have selectable and copyable text. Your images inside PDF won't have any of that. <comment11892> @HMage: Yes, right. Indeed, my sheets have no text on them, so this is not much of an issue. But your remark is useful for people with a different problem. <comment110204> Nah, that sucks. Especially for vector graphics PDFs you will loose a lot of "image quality" <comment137246> It sometimes open then in different windows. How can I force them to load in the same window? <comment137247> Ah, dragging didn't worked in Table of Contents view, but worked in Thumbnail view. <comment141101> Awesome. Had to submit homework and just saved a lot of time from figuring it out. Thanks. <comment237028> That's the reason why I love Mac. :) <comment241256> To do this from the Photos application, select all the photos, click File = Print, click Print again, and then click Save as a PDF in the screen where you select your printer. <comment272637> Sometimes only print to PDF works. I guess if the images are different formats (e.g., PNG + JPG). Make sure you don't have any of the images open in a separate window. <comment281452> Is there any way to avoid the margin which was created while creating pdf in this method ? <comment361172> ref to https://superuser.com/a/854606/475424 too :) <comment362088> When I hit print, I just get the "thunk" sound effect and absolutely nothing happens.
