Should I join a Mac to the domain using a network account or local account? <body> Is there any diference joining a computer to the domain under the local admin account or using the new network account? Does the computer emhave/em to be added using the new network account? If I added using the local admin is there any difference (any impact)?  supOS X 10.8/sup  <comment122284> Once you've joined the computer to the domain, it stays joined.  And, since logging in via a network account requires the computer to already be joined to the domain where the network account exists, it can only be added from a local account.  If you are using multiple domains, then, I suppose you could log in with one, before setting up the other... but, I don't think that's what you're asking about.
