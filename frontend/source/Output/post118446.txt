Open picture currently displayed in Screen Saver? <body>    strongTL;DR/strong In iTunes, you can press codeCommand-L/code (emControls/Go to Current Song/em) to see what is playing. Is there a similar function to emGo To Current Photo/em (in iPhoto) when I see a picture in the screen saver?   My photo library has thousands of pictures. I use the built-in screen saver "Classic" to display the photos.  Sometimes the screen saver displays a photo I'd like to do something more with. Perhaps email it to a friend.  How can I jump to the photo in iPhoto so I can do more with it?  I found one similar question here, but it doesn't cover emGo To Current Photo/em: How do I enable the interactive iPhoto screen saver in OSX Lion?
