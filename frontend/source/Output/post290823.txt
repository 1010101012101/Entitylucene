Safari can’t show the filein the Finder. Errors <body> Ever since I got my mac I was able to download movies by doing "Download Video" Or something like that by right clicking the video. Recently after I've cleaned out my Mac of all of the things I didn't need after doing that I am unable to download anything. It simply get this error Safari can’t show the file "_____" in the Finder. in the Finder because the file has not yet been created. Ive tried everything although there are no articles on how to fix this.   <comment367200> A list of "what you didn't need" would be useful... presumably you also threw out sometime you *did* need.
