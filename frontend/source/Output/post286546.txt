iPhone Apps pause update when screen is locked <body> It seems that when updating multiple Apps and locking the screen, updates are not completed until reopening the phone.  Once I used the 'Update All', which started updating, before going to sleep, only to find hours later that most of the Apps are waiting in some 'installing' stage. Once I unlocked the phone, it took 5 minutes for them to finish. Can't tell if this is intended and what are the reasons.  It use to be that when I used the 'Update All', close the phone (locked screen) and come back 10 minutes later and everything is updated.
