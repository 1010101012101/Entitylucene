Font gets replaced <body> I'm having the following problem! My fonts get replaced in multiple programs (E.g. twitter, itunes, tweetdeck) It all looks like the screenshot I added below. I don't know how this came all of a sudden and it's really anoying, does anyone know what I can do to solve this problem?  I tried: rebooting and resolve standard fonts in font-book.  Thanks a lot!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/izowu.png" alt="font get replaced"  <answer42902> Get Onyx, go into Cleaning - Fonts, check all, Execute.  If that doesn't work, check your disk for errors.  If it still doesn't work, your fonts are are missing or corrupt - reinstall OS X.  <comment48795> You could also use the Apple Type Services utility: `sudo atsutil databases -remove; sudo atsutil server -shutdown; sudo atsutil server -ping` <comment48797> Tried onyx, it worked! thanks a lot!
