DNS on separate interface not working <body> I have two interfaces configured. Wi-Fi which receives DNS via DHCP and I have a thunderbolt port statically configured to connect to a local subnet without a default gateway. I have configured a DNS server on the thunderbolt interface and that interface has a higher service order preference then Wi-Fi.   The Mac never tries to resolve DNS to the server on the thunderbolt interface, it only uses the servers on Wi-Fi. I can manually resolve using it just fine:  precodenslookup test.lab 10.0.0.21 /code/pre  Where code10.0.0.21/code is the DNS on the network the thunderbolt interface is connected.   Running  precodescutil --dns /code/pre  Shows that both the DNS servers on Wi-Fi and the DNS server on thunderbolt are there, however only the servers on Wi-Fi are in code/etc/resolv.conf/code. What is going on here? Why is codescutil/code telling me the server is listed but it won't try resolving to it?  precode$ scutil --dns DNS configuration  resolver #1   search domain[0] : example.com   search domain[1] : example2.com   nameserver[0] : 10.20.20.20   nameserver[1] : 10.30.30.30   nameserver[2] : 10.40.40.40   if_index : 4 (en0)   flags    : Request A records Reachable  # mdns omitted  DNS configuration (for scoped queries)  resolver #1   search domain[0] : test.lab   nameserver[0] : 10.0.0.21   if_index : 6 (en2)   flags    : Scoped, Request A records Reachable, Directly Reachable Address  resolver #2   search domain[0] : example.com   search domain[1] : example2.com   nameserver[0] : 10.20.20.20   nameserver[1] : 10.30.30.30   nameserver[2] : 10.40.40.40   if_index : 4 (en0)   flags    : Scoped, Request A records Reachable /code/pre  <comment317925> Is this all on the same machine? If so, it will only use the DNS server specified in System Prefs. If you add the IP Address of your local DNS server (the thunderbolt interface?) in there does it work? <comment317927> What do you mean by "all on the same machine?" The DNS server in question is on the network connected via thunderbolt. And yes, that server is configured via Sys Prefs on the thunderbolt interface. <comment317928> When you said "I have configured a DNS server on the thunderbolt interface" I assumed you meant you enabled DNS on this network interface. But it sounds like DNS is running on another machine on the local network... <comment317929> Sorry for the confusion. That is correct, the DNS server is external to the Mac. It is on the network that the thunderbolt interface is connected to. <comment317935> Ah- no worries. We all know what happens when you assume!  lol  Anyway, what are you trying to look up? Is this DNS server authoritative for a domain? The `scutil` man page says "Those containing a "domain" name will be used for queries matching the specified domain.  Those without will be used as a "default" configuration in addition to the first listed." which makes me think that if it's not authoritative for a domain then it won't be checked. Thinking out loud... <comment317937> Oh, you're probably looking up `test.lab` Can you post your `scutil --dns` output? At least for resolver that contains test.lab? <comment317940> Just edited the post. <comment317944> Well, still not sure... Does `dig NS test.lab` show your 10.0.0.21 server in the answer section?
