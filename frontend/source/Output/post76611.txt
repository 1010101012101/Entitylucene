Can't access /etc folder in OS X Mountain Lion <body> In OS X Mountain Lion's Finder, I can see a grayed-out code/etc/code folder, but cannot see inside.  Using Terminal's codels/code command, I can see the existence of a file that one of my programs is trying to find (Free Pascal's codefpc/code program has a codefpc.cfg/code file in code/etc/code).  How can I change parameters for this folder to enable more open access?  <answer76629> precodelrwxr-xr-x@   1 root     wheel       11 Oct 19 16:00 etc -&gt; private/etc /code/pre  the folder owner is root. if your program need to access it, you can run it under root account.  <answer76630> Hit kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⇧/kbd+kbdG/kbd (or select codeGo/code - codeGo to Folder.../code from the Finder menu bar) and enter code/etc/code or any existing and readable path as the target location to browse it.  Given you enabled showing of hidden files, while double-clicking codeetc/code from Finder does not work, you can still right-click it and choose codeOpen/code from the context menu.  The system-wide configuration files in code/etc/code are best to be treated with caution just as all the other hidden system files and therefor I'd certainly not recommend changing permissions for them, but if you do need to view or edit them I would suggest doing it from the Terminal. This will also make it easier to gain the necessary root privileges for changing them by using the codesudo/code command.  <comment88867> Read access is enabled for all users (that's what the `rwxr-xr-x` at the beginning says) <comment88870> OT doesn't say what kind of access he need. I do know r-x allows read and execute access. <comment88871> Fair point. But enabling the root account just to edit a file in `/etc` seems a bit too much. It's easier to use `sudo` for this.
