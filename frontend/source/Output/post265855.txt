Permission error when mounting drives through terminal <body> I am trying to mount a network share via the terminal but I'm running into permission errors when it comes to opening the share. Here are the commands I executed to create a mountpoint and to mount the share:  precodesudo mkdir -p /mnt sudo mount_afp afp://user:password@192.168.1.1/test /mnt /code/pre  The share then mounts fine but when I try to open it it tells me I don't have permission to do so. Has this something to do with running these commands as sudo? If I connect to the share through Finder I have full access.  Any idea what I am missing here?  <comment333366> Which permissions are set for /mnt, before and after the mount? Why do you use sudo at all? <comment333374> when i tried to make the directory /mnt using mkdir -p /mnt i got permission denied thats why i created in using sudo <comment333378> And the permissions now are what exactly? Does it work if you make a folder within your home directory and mount to that?
