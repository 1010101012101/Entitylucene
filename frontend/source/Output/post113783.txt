Why won't my restored iPhone 4S accept my Apple ID credentials? <body> I recently had to restore my iPhone 4S (iOS 7) and when I turned it back on and the activation screen came up, it prompted me for my Apple ID credentials. I put in my Apple ID username and password but it says that it's wrong. I tried to change my password, but when I did, and tried the new password, it still doesn't work.   What should I do?   I obviously can't even use my phone to make a call.  <answer113801> Try connecting via https://appleid.apple.com/ probably something wrong with your password.  Consider once you have access to the page to check your contact information, add a secondary e-mail etcâ€¦  If you still experience problems you should contact an Apple adviser via http://support.apple.com/  <comment133512> I'm assuming that you have confirmed, positively, that the exact same login info works on other devices, or https://appleid.apple.com/, as you are using for this. Also, do you have a good wifi, or cellular data connection?
