Time Machine - List of Files that were backed up <body> I'd like to know to see which files are getting backed up by my time machine? I often see a large amount of data being transfered and I'm not sure sure what it is.  <answer68516> The command codetmutil compare/code lets you compare file lists if you don't want to do it using codels/code or other commands that can show differences in files and folders like codersync/code and many graphical diff programs.  You can list backup paths and then copy them into the compare command. Example:  precodesudo tmutil listbackups sudo tmutil compare "path1" "path2" /code/pre  Many people adore BackupLoupe as well. It makes a powerful database of what files are included with each backup interval.  <answer91830> You can use timedog for that.      timedog is a Perl script that displays the set of files that were saved for any given backup created by Mac OS X Time Machine. By default it shows those files that were saved in the most recent backup. The listing includes the file sizes before and after, as well as a total file count and size. The script includes an option to summarize changes to a particular directory depth, producing a more concise display, helping to get an understanding of which areas of your system are taking up the most space in the backups. It can also sort by size, and/or omit files below a given size.   <answer120388> If you're interested in seeing what files are being read as the backup happens, you can use this command:  precodesudo opensnoop -n backupd | grep -v 'Time Machine Backups' /code/pre  <answer246116> If you want to watch which files are being transfered in realtime you can monitor the time machine daemon with  precodesudo fs_usage -f -R filesys backupd /code/pre  If you see abnoramly large file transfer you might see disk images from virtual machines in the list  <comment79571> possible duplicate of [How can I use tmutil to figure out which files just got deleted?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24446/how-can-i-use-tmutil-to-figure-out-which-files-just-got-deleted) <comment79574> Thanks! i'll try it out when I'm by my TimeCapsule) I think this is exactly what I was looking for)) <comment79575> Why not edit the question a bit to make it more clear what you were wanting. It'll likely get you some up votes if you care for it and put a real title on it rather than a fragment of a phrase. <comment79616> A zero cost alternative to BackupLoupe is [TimeTracker](http://www.charlessoft.com/). Does the job well enough for me. <comment185400> works well, even with AirportExpress attached storage. <comment303379> I'm guessing you meant `sudo fs_usage -f filesys -R backupd` instead... I'll check it out once I connect to my home network) <comment303381> That throws an `Can't open RAW file: No such file or directory` error, the man pages have an example like this `fs_usage -w -f filesys Mail` <comment303874> I get a lot of lines like `dtrace: error on enabled probe ID 5 (ID 161: syscall::open:return): invalid user access in action #11 at DIF offset 24` but nothing else. <comment344135> Honorable mention goes to [timedog](https://github.com/nlfiedler/timedog) open source utility.
