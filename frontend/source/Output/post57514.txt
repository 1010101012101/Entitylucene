What is assistantd? <body> Ever since I upgraded to OS X Mountain Lion and installed OS X Server, I keep getting prompts for my Keychain password from a process called codeassistantd/code.  I'm pretty sure that it's an OS X process, but don't want to give access to my keychain to just any process.  So, my ultimate question is: does anyone know what codeassistantd/code is and why it would need access to my keychain?  <answer57566> According to this site, Ongoing Cross-Section of assistantd Headers - Useful for Siri Mods, it appears codeassistantd/code is associated with Siri functionality on iOS.  Given this, I suspect codeassistantd/code on Mac OS X is related to the new dictation functionality. Dictation on Mac OS X 10.8 uses Contacts and other personal information to improve accuracy; gaining access to this information would explain the need for Keychain access.  <answer88492> It is there to support the speech function. By default, dictation runs when you press the fn button twice.  <comment66152> No, not exactly. Retrieving the contacts does not need Keychain access. It's a separate API. <comment66177> @MaxRied could you expand on what you mean by being a separate API? Keychain access may be required for purposes other than storing passwords; it may be the daemon requires proof that it has appropriate authority to the requested information. <comment68695> If you search for it with `mdfind`, you'll see that it's in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AssistantServices.framework/`.
