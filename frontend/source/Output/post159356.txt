Is there a way to show each CPU's load separately? <body> I'm seeking an equivalent of a common Linux based process monitor, which shows a history graph for each CPU core.  This can help identify programs that are effectively using all the cores (here, Google Chrome).  Is there a way to get Apple system monitor to do this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBKYN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer159359> You can use strongActivity Monitor/strong's CPU History.     Applications  Utilities  Activity Monitor.app   Within Activity Monitor, select the menu item strongWindow/strong  strongCPU History/strong to reveal a per CPU load history.  The output is not as detailed as the Linux process monitor in your question but it is free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OvSnb.png" alt="Activity Monitor CPU History"  Apple's OS X: Activity Monitor shows one CPU Usage graph on systems with more than four cores explains more about the behaviour of the CPU graph.  Third party products, such as iStat Menus, are available that extend your options.  <answer159360> I don't know of anything with that kind of detail, but Apple's own Activity Monitor [Applications/Utilities] can show a basic history graph per core. kbd Cmd ⌘  /kbd kbd 3 /kbd to initiate.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hx42X.png" alt="enter image description here"  System shows in red, user in green, btw.  <answer159374> Another application which may be helpful (depending on your needs) is codeInstruments.app/code included in Xcode.    It doesn't allow a continuous easy monitoring like codeiStat Menus/code or codeActivity Monitor/code do, due to the fact that some user interaction is needed to set up a sample and start recording it. On the other hand you may monitor single applications – a feature the aforementioned apps don't accomplish.br From a programmer's perspective this may be very useful.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vPmBK.jpg" alt="instruments"  Usage: Instruments Help kbdcmd/kbdkbd?/kbd - Viewing Collected Data - Monitoring Multiple Core Usage  <answer160140> There is also iStatMenus, a commercial app, available which allows such stat to be monitored.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Exnt1.png" alt="Menubar view by core" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YSseL.png" alt="Extended menubar view" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MAiPR.png" alt="Setup options window"  <comment187285> +1, protip: to make window screenshot press: ⌘⇧4 and then press spacebar. It'll look as in @Graham Miln image. <comment187287> yup, one of those things I'm aware of, but my trigger-happy snapshot finger doesn't have the patience sometimes ;) <comment187288> there, fixed it ;)
