How to determine which files are on SSD on Fusion Drive? <body> My question is:     How can i determine which files are on the SSD "partition" on Fusion   Drive?   I have an iMac with 1TB Fusion Drive, and it would be good to know which apps or data are on which partition.      Is these information included in the file information or where do i   have to look?   Terminal is no problem, so i'm not searching for a easy answer.   EDIT: codediskutil list/code shows me my partitions. But i cannot navigate through /Volumes/... into the specific SSD partition. There must be a way to navigate into each partition, right?  OS X does the same.  <answer88954> Because the Fusion drive is one logical volume, there are no separate "partitions" to browse to determine this. You can however check which drive an given file is stored on with some command-line utilities.  h2Determine Your Drive Setup/h2  First we have to figure out how the SSD and HD portions of the Fusion drive are identified in your system.  ol liRun codediskutil list/code in Terminal./li liYou should see output similar to this:  precode#: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: GUID_partition_scheme *121.3 GB disk0 1: EFI 209.7 MB disk0s1 2: Apple_CoreStorage 121.0 GB disk0s2 3: Apple_Boot Boot OS X 134.2 MB disk0s3 /dev/disk1 #: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: GUID_partition_scheme *1.0 TB disk1 1: EFI 209.7 MB disk1s1 2: Apple_CoreStorage 999.3 GB disk1s2 3: Apple_Boot Recovery HD 650.0 MB disk1s3 /dev/disk2 #: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: Apple_HFS Macintosh HD *1.1 TB disk2 /code/pre/li liTake note of labels of the disks with a codeGUID_partition_scheme/code line. In this case, that's codedisk0/code and codedisk1/code. These are the two physical disks, and we can see by the sizes, the smaller one (codedisk0/code) is the SSD, meaning codedisk1/code is the HD while codedisk2/code is the logical volume./li /ol  h2Monitor Disk Activity/h2  Now we need a way to monitor disk activity for each device.  ol liOpen Terminal, enter codeiostat -d disk0 disk1 1/code, emreplacing the disk numbers with those you found in above/em./li liRun the command, and leave the Terminal window open. You should see output similar to this:  precode       disk0           disk1   KB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s   26.52  13  0.33     9.35   0  0.00   0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00   0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00   0.00   0  0.00     0.00   0  0.00  /code/pre  This shows you the disk activity on a per-device basis, updated every second. The MB/s columns are the most relevant./li /ol  h2Read a File/h2  Now we'll read a file, and use our monitoring solution to discover which drive it resides on.  ol liOpen a second Terminal window, and run codedd if='/path/to/some/file' of=/dev/null/code. Replace the path with the proper path to the file (be sure it's quoted if it has unescaped spaces or other special characters)./li liIn the terminal window running codeiostat/code, watch the to see which disk shows some activity when codedd/code is running. That's the drive the file resides on./li liFor large files (especially those on the HD, the dd process may run for a while, you can safely quit it with kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdC/kbd/li /ol  Readings like this indicate that codedisk0/code (the SSD in this example) contains the file:  precode       disk0           disk1   KB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s   28.49  13  0.37   113.92   0  0.00   31.70 4500 139.29     0.00   0  0.00   31.64 3870 119.56     0.00   0  0.00   31.58 3294 101.58     0.00   0  0.00  /code/pre  Whereas these readings indicate that the file is stored on the HD:  precode       disk0           disk1   KB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s   0.00   0  0.00   128.00 275 34.33   0.00   0  0.00   128.00 255 31.83   7.62  53  0.39   126.90 178 22.03  /code/pre  <answer227228> If you want that much control over which files go where, it's easy enough to break up the fusion drive and just have two separate volumes you can navigate separately. It's also very easy in OS X to have the OS including applications on one drive (the SSD) and have the user account live on a different drive (the HDD). Then you can manually manage where you want other files, the SSD or the HDD.   <comment104302> This isn't an answer but is definitely worth a look:   http://www.anandtech.com/show/6679/a-month-with-apples-fusion-drive  The author uses [iStat Menus 4](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25230/istat-menus) to view disk activity of the individual devices, you can see them on page 3, "Under The Hood." <comment104309> That's great! Thank's a lot! But there are always smaller writes to the drive. Even if i don't do anything. Plus a delay when i execute the "dd". For smaller files (10MB), there is a "problem". But if i execute the dd, there are, after 3 seconds, always on the "ssd"-side transactions...so maybe this helps! <comment104314> Depending on the access patterns and how long you've been using your Fusion drive, accessing a file once or twice may be enough for the system to "promote" it to the SSD, in which case you may see access on both, so it's unfortunately not foolproof, but it should be enough for a good guess. <comment104336> But a question: Why doesn't the "df "filename" command doesn't show the right partition? It only shows "disk2". <comment104337> Because Fusion doesn't work with traditional partitions. `disk2` in is the logical volume created by joining the two drives. From the filesystem's point of view, that is where the file lives, but it's independent of where the underlying bits are physically stored. You might want to read up on [how the Fusion drive works](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/10/more-on-fusion-drive-how-it-works-and-how-to-roll-your-own/) for a more in-depth explanation. <comment276014> I think the question is referring not to how to break it but how to determine where files have automatically been sorted.
