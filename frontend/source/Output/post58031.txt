Why do I get a '"Calendar Cache" couldn't be moved' error when launching Calendar? <body> After upgrading to Mountain Lion, I get the following error message when I launch Calendar.app:  "Calendar Cache couldn't be moved because you don't have permission to access "Calendars".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wle2m.png" alt="Screenshot of Calendar app with error dialog"  When I click "OK", Calendar quits.  This user is an administrator on the machine. I tried granting the user 'Read &amp; Write' access to emCalendar.app/em, but nothing changed.  I have another administrator account on the same machine that can launch Calendar.app without issue.  <answer58731> If repairing permissions with Disk Utility and/or checking permissions for the actual calendar-files in /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Calendars do not work imaybe/i this will:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3773022?start=0&amp;tstart=0  strikeSeems a bit drastic though. iI have not tried this myself./i I suggest having a backup just in case./strike  bUpdate/b: I just tried the instructions from the thread at apple discussions, and everything on my 10.8 system is OK. It's kind of a supercharged permissions-repair (lacking better terms atm).  If it works, thank macjack at the appe forums. If not, tell me :)  On my mac the ~/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache is owned by me:br/ code-rw-r--r--@  1 nils  staff  2813952 Jul 31 18:44 Calendar Cache/code  It may be of help if you post the output from this terminal command:br/ codels -lar ~/Library/Calendars/|grep "Calendar Cache"/code  <answer59014> Since I've never actually used iCal/Calendar.app on that user account before and there was no data to potentially lose, I decided to try deleting code~/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache/code entirely. Calendar.app started without complaint after that.  I'm not sure what would have happened to my calendars if I actually had anything in Calendar.app to lose, but it did fix the issue.  <comment67992> The permissions on `Calendar Cache` are identical to what you posted.
