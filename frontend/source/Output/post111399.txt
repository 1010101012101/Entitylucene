Risks of publishing the computer serial number on the Internet <body> I'm searching used Macs to buy in eBay. Some of the offered items show the computer's serial numbers in screenshots and/or plain text.  Reading the Q&amp;A Where to find factory list in apple serial number, we see this snippet from EveryMac.com (emphasis on the original):     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/72mpH.png" alt="enter image description here" title="Your full serial number should not be posted or shared with third-parties on the Internet"   Why not? What are the risks of buying a Mac whose serial number emhas been shared on the Internet/em?  <answer111425> Just throwing my 2 cents in there,  someone could possibly claim it as theirs, and stolen. *shrugs  <answer242267> If you have AppleCare phone support, one could, in theory, use your serial number to contact AppleCare for free support.  Otherwise, there's no risk to sharing a serial number when selling your Mac.
