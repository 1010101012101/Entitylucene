Can OS X be configured to avoid seeing a WiFi log in window when joining some networks? <body> In Mountain Lion (10.8), when you connect to a wireless network with a default login page - a special window pops up showing that page.  This pop-up is set to always in front, and also doesn't store any passwords / login information (unlike chrome, firefox, etc).  This is really annoying.  Is there anyway to make this popup window store passwords and login information or just disable that visual step altogether?  <answer77770> According to this thread, you just need to rename the following file:  code/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app/code  to something else and it will not show up anymore.  <comment91162> Yes, that does seem to work; and there don't seem to be any ways to adopt spellcheck...
