How can I effectively hide my macbook while traveling to prevent theft <body> I will be taking my Macbook Pro Retina for a backpacking trip and will be working from public places (i.e. coffee shops, public squares) for a while. I am quite concerned though, that it will be stolen.   Aside from the obvious precautions for theft, like not leaving it out of eyesight, backing everything up to a second disk, encrypting stuff, firmware password, setting up prey etc. I am looking for a way to disguise the machine as something more undesirable than a macbook.  Of course there is always the Book Cover disguise or the option to cover the whole thing in conference stickers so it looks like a piece of trash, but maybe you guys know something equally suitable for this purpose?  <answer101894> You could also use this little program, to scare ppl off, but nothing is safer than hanging on to it.  That program called iAlertU does following:  Once activated, it will trigger an alarm as soon as your MacBook is moved or your keyboard/trackpad is touched.  It can also automatically take a snapshot of the robber with the iSight camera and send it automatically by email. ?? at least you will know what the face was looking like :)  It could be disturbing however in a conference rooms, while you are trying to turn it off.  <answer101919> Searching on the web for "laptop skin" or "removable laptop skin" would provide you a list of designers and sellers for laptop skins. Buy a boring laptop skin and use it on your MacBook Pro.  Some sites for laptop skins (in no particular order):    ul liCafePress  /li liGelaskins  /li liZazzle  /li liDecalGirl  /li liSkinit  /li /ul  <comment120020> I like your piece of trash idea :) <comment120089> A Lot of photographers use black gaff-a tape on their cameras. The one problem doing it on a Mac. Is I suspect it will ruin the finish.. You could put a MS Windows logo on it. No will touch it then ;-)
