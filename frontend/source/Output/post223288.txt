How to get local directory names into terminal window titles? <body> The title of my terminal window is:  emTerminal -- bash -- 130x39/em  This is how I see them listed in Terminal-Window and it is very hard to know which one is which.  When I use multiple terminals, strongthe most important information/strong is the stronglocal directory/strong in each of them.  Is there any way to have that local directory appear in the titles, so I could see easily which terminal is from where?  <answer223317> Go to Preferences - Profiles - Window and check those things you would like to see in the terminal window title.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzsbB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment270770> Sadly this option is not offered on 10.8 <comment270771> @DmitriZaitsev, I think this answer might be of help to you: https://superuser.com/questions/79972/set-the-title-of-the-terminal-window-to-the-current-directory
