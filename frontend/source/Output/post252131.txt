Get Spotlight to index a NAS <body> Is there a way to have Spotlight index the volumes on a NAS?  I've used this: codemdutil /Volumes/multimedia -i on/code. But results aren't there next time the system starts up.  I'm running 10.11 on a Mac Pro 2012 Westmere.  <answer252151> Spotlight requires use of the HFS Plus filesystem. It can't index your SMB shares. There exist some third-party solutions to iterate over your filesystem to create and maintain searchable databases, but it's not possible with Spotlight.
