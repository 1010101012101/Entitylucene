How to make Final Cut Pro to use my Tera bytes' HDD and not my Laptop's HDD? <body> I want all videos to my external HDD and not my laptop's HDD and Final Cut Pro does not give this option. I am not wanting to use my MBA's free space for video editing. How can I define the location of videos in Final Cut Pro?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r1Kyb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer128210> strongChange the Save to location to be your external drive./strong  Since 10.1 you can also create a library which can be stored externally. See:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5958/li /ul  <comment150178> I see it is that easy -- just create a new library and move that to the new HDD -- and how do you move a project from one library to another library? <comment150179> @hhh Just drag it inside FCPX <comment150212> Can you clarify how to drag it inside FCPX? <comment150213> @hhh Have both libraries open, find the project in the library and drag it from the browser to the other project.
