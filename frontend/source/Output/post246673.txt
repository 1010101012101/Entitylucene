Automatically forward incoming SMS messages to email <body> How can I set up my iPhone 6 to automatically forward incoming SMS messages to my email address (or addresses)?  Is it possible to restrict this automatic  forwarding to a particular set of senders, e.g., automatically forward only SMS messages from Bob and Charlie?  <comment304331> There is certainly no way to do this with iOS, you could definitely do this with a nice Android phone.
