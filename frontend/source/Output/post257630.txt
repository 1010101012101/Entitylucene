Can you install OS X from a USB on late 2010 iMac? <body> I'm having quite a few difficulties with my old, late 2010 iMac, and upgrading from Lion to Siearra did not help. I have used my Laptop to create a USB Boot for El Capitan, and I would like to use it to downgrade my Desktop to El Capitan.  I know these older models of iMac cannot install Windows, via Bootcamp, from a USB, but is this the same for OSX? Any help with downgrading/fresh installing to El Capitan would be much appreciated.  P.S. My iMac's super drive is broken, so I cannot install anything from a disc. It's USB or nothing, I'm afraid.  <answer257665> Your iMac late 2010 is compatible with Sierra according to the official MacOS Sierra - Technical Specifications page.     strongMac Hardware Requirements/strong      For details about your Mac model, click the Apple icon at the top left   of your screen, choose About This Mac, then choose More Info.

It's up to you what OS installation to proceed with, but as long as your hardware supports the newest OS version I would go with clean install of Sierra.  Before proceeding further make sure you have your data backup somewhere, preferably using Time Machine. Also make sure you have a working memory stick with 8GB or more on it.  You can create a bootable USB drive with macOS Sierra on it following these steps:  ol liGo to App Store and Download macOS Sierra. You can do that even you already have the macOS installed. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3uvPT.png" alt="macOS Sierra App Store"/li liWhen the download will be finished the popup will appear asking you to proceed with installation.
