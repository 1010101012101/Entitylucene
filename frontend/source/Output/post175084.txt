Bookmarks in Safari: Type bookmark name to go to it <body> I have a bunch of bookmarks named things like "CNC" "FB" and "HQ" and the like.  I'm a bit of a keyboard junkie. I want to be able to access these quickly, by typing CMD-L, and then such initials into Safari's address bar.  Sometimes it works, the initials make it into the Top Hits img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vScWf.png" alt="when it works"  This allows me to down cursor and press return.  But, most of the time the google search comes up first. That's so much pressing I might as well have just used the pointer.  I saw Quickly Access Safari 6 Bookmark &amp; History Address Bar Suggestions with the Keyboard? but I don't want to disable the suggested search, just down prioritize it under my bookmarks, which surely should be a better hit than random stuff on the internet.  So, in a nutshell - can I customize Safari to have have "Bookmarks and History" to appear as the first (top result) section to replace Top Hits?  <comment206319> Another way of thinking about this is that I want "Bookmarks and History" to appear as the first section, in Top Hits. <comment206321> And I noted cmd-down. Still not what I wanted.
