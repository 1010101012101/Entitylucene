At work I have my MBP connected to the LAN via a Thunderbolt Dock with an ethernet port, though I am able to enable/disable wifi and to use the internet via wifi. <comment361144> @northsea Your setup shouldn't work, as far as I know. I've noticed the same thing that macOS prefers the wired connection if it's available. If you're connected to the LAN, you may be getting an internet connection from there. <comment361199> @WilliamTFroggard Hm... maybe. I will check that on Monday morning. <comment362643> @WilliamTFroggard No it works. See my answer
