I cannot find the option.  <answer39697> Once an RSS feed is added to Mail, you cannot see the URL it retrieves anywhere within Mail :(  There does not appear to be any way you can read the configuration using Applescript, looking at the dictionary, the RSS feeds are not accessible either as a distinct entity type or as a Mailbox type.  The only place I can find this information is in ~/Library/Mail/RSS  Each feed is a folder with an .rssmbox extension and inside the folder, the Info.plist contains the URL of the feed.  edit: change reponse re: applescript after further investigation   <comment44849> Thanks! although a feature in the mail.app would be great, this solution is good enough in case you need to retrieve it some day.
