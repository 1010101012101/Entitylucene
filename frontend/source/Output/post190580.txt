Does taking keys off of a MacBook keyboard void warranty <body> I have some friends that try turning my MacBook Pro off (I always do it back to them if they do :) ).  My question is to make it harder for them to do that I could remove the power button key from my Mac. Would this void the warranty or not? I want to know this because I got AppleCare and do not want to waste that money  <answer190627> Assuming you signed the AppleCare plan on the US, this is what the legal document states:     strong4. What is not Covered?/strong      (ii) Damage caused by (…) (b) accident, abuse, misuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other external cause, (c) operating the Covered Equipment outside the permitted or intended uses described by the manufacturer, or (d) service (including upgrades and expansions) performed by anyone who is not a representative of Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”);   I'm not a lawyer, but abuse and misuse may be applied to removing keys.br You may get away with it if you present it as an "upgrade", and you are an Apple Authorized Service Provider :)  <answer190651> Generally you can do stronganything/strong to your Apple device as long as the Apple Genius/tech cant see evidence of what was done. Which means that If popping off key caps and then putting them back on leaves no trace you are likely safe.  And I mean strongno/strong trace. You would be surprised what an Apple genius/technician will find that you never noticed.   And third party replacements totally count as evidence of "tampering." So if you put a 3rd party SSD (or RAM, or whatever) in the Mac, put the Apple branded part back in before you take it in to Apple as they will take it out and say they can't and won't support non-Apple parts.  <comment226322> First of all tell your friends not to touch your computer in a mischievous way, and you in kind, _tell them to grow up!_  Secondly even if you pop the key off that will not stop it from being able to be shutoff, even removing the additional parts under the key as well.  You also risk breaking the key cap retainer so IMO it's not worth the risk of possibly damaging and or loosing keyboard parts just to keep your friends in check.  As to voiding the warranty probably not however I'd verify that with Apple Support first. <comment226324> @user3439894 I do tell them not to. Since they do it to me I just spam tabs on their computer till it crashes :) We still have fun though. Just want to stop them. :) <comment226400> Would they be able to detect that you removed the button if you can put it back on or not? If so does this mean the inly risk is if you break the button? <comment226418> Will they be able to detect new keys? <comment226581> They might. Make friends with an Apple Genius and ask them. <comment226584> I rather not take the risk then. That is the 'key' to keeping warranty! Lol <comment226627> That would be my advice, but some people are a little braver... hah. <comment226657> I could do it but what is the point incase I end up loosing money?
