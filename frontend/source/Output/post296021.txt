Mobile and iPhone labels dont appear in Messages app <body> I sent "feedback" to Apple that when I type someone's name in Messages (both on iPhone and MacBook) a list of emall/em their phone numbers appears as options to send to, but none show the iPhone or Mobile label I gave them.  I've texted land lines a good number of times because of that.  Also, in some of my Contacts, the text bubble doesn't show up next to a phone labeled iPhone.  (Sorry, that's emtwo/em questions, but I think they're related).  Anyone find workarounds?   <comment373873> If this happens with multiple of your contacts, I'm thinking the problem is on your side; I don't experience this. Have you tried signing out and back in to iCloud?
