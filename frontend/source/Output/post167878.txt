My Yahoo Mail does not receive new mail <body> My Yahoo Mail does not receive new mail. It sends, but no new mail arrives. I cannot update Yahoo Mail app, as I am using the latest version. Can I delete the mail app and reinstall it without messing up my Apple account which is tied to the Yahoo Mail account?
