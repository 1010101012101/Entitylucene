Preventing safari from opening Preview for images <body> Every time I download an image from a site, using Safari, as soon as the images finish download, it opens Preview to show me the image. Other browsers don't do that.  Try this link.  How do I prevent Safari from launching Preview?  <answer48394> In the general pane of the preferences, uncheck the 'Open "safe" files after downloading'. I have mine unchecked and Safari doesn't open the file downloaded in your example link.  <comment55449> I missed that! That solves the problem! Thanks!!!!!!!!!!
