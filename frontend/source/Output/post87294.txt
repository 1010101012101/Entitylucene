How can I disable active desktop switching itself/ <body> I use my MacBook Pro with many desktops. Some appication events switches the active desktop to another one, for example Safari does it when I open Gmail. I write my Gmail username and password then push enter. By the way I want to look at another desktop but Safari puts me back to Gmail screen. It happens until gmail loading completely.  Or sometimes, (I use Avira Antivirus for trial) Avira tries to update itself and my active desktop changes to another. As there is no active 'Avira update desktop' it only switches to another random desktop.  These situations are very disturbing. Is there a way to stop switching active desktop without my intention?  <comment102021> Have you already unchecked System Preferences  Mission Control  When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application? <comment102025> I have just tried it but it does not work for this situation
