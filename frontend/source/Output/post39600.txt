Can you perhaps get some help editing your question to make it clearer?

He had his computer serviced, but no problem was found and he is now trying to diagnose the flashing issue. Someone suggested recording a video with QuickTime Player, but flashing didn't occur while recording. Last message in the forum suggests that he found the source of the problem: Unofficial package for slovak spellchecking. (It's bit confusing even in original)
