unwanted login window <body> I have a macbook pro 13 retina late 2013. Lately I have noticed when I start it up and the login page opens there is a login window entitled "others". I have no idea how it got there and it is not in users and groups in settings. Can anyone tell me how to delete this and how it might have got there  <comment168805> Have you tried the suggestions in this similar question?  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/85046/how-to-remove-guest-option-from-login-screen/
