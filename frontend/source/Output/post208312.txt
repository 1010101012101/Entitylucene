Why does Apple ship bash 3.2? <body> For several years I have been wondering why Apple ships new OS X releases with old version of Bash.  I came across the question Update bash to version 4.0 on OSX where there is a mention of problem with the fact that new bash is released under GPLv3. Is it true? If so, what problem has Apple with this license? There isn't any other GPLv3'd software in OSX?  <answer208405> ol liYes, newer versions of Bash are released under GPLv3/li liThis question brings out armchair lawyers that argue points for and against GPLv3. Simply put, GPLv3 conflicts with Apple's Licensing Policies (among other licenses). None of these licenses prevent you from downloading the source code and compiling a newer version of Bash. On a historical note, Bash was not originally offered as a shell in OS X./li liApple does not supply any software under the GPLv3 license./li /ol  <comment251394> I've rolled back your edit. Discussions about differences between GPL licenses are off-topic on AD <comment251395> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because we generally close questions asking "Why does Apple do X?" as they are generally not practical minded and generally opinion based. We can discuss editing this on [meta] and please edit this if there is a practical question you are trying to fix. Apple's choices are well worth criticizing and discussing - just that we require it to be in the context of a question that's otherwise on topic. <comment319418> Makes me wonder why they don't just prepackage zsh instead, it's Apache 2 and more user-friendly. It's faster than bash too: http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/148098 (not 100% POSIX but they can leave bash 3 for those few system scripts that break without it).
