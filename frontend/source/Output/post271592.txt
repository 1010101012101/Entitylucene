App Store apps won't download <body> My 2016 MacBook Pro with touch bar just arrived in the mail yesterday. I have since been unable to download select App Store apps, large ones from what I've seen: Xcode and a Sierra update.  When I try to download these apps, the time remaining increases very very quickly and eventually changes to calculating and freezes.   This is not an internet problem - we pay for 300mbps from Spectrum and speedtest.net says that I'm getting about 25mbps (to be expected from our packed home network)  I was able to update Sierra with a flash drive but am still having difficulties with Xcode.  Note: I was able to download small apps, such as Spark for email and Flappy Golf 2 (as a test)  EDIT: Well, I just found Xcode installed on my computer for whatever reason, so case closed it seems. I think the estimate was waaaayy off, but Xcode still ended up installing in the background and that this is just a bug in emSierra 10.12.3 16D32/em
