Inconsistent mouse behavior in Lion <body> Two different mice?mouses? work for a while and then the light connection gets intermittent and eventually is lost. The pointer is then inactivated - but I can use the scroll wheel on the mouse and activate the right click button.  <answer48997> Are they plugged into the same 'upstream' USB device, such as two ports on the same keyboard?  Ideally, you'd have them plugged into individual USB ports on the Mac itself.  <comment56069> Hi Jane, welcome.  Please can I ask you to provide more details, what OS and hardware you are using?  This will help us help you faster :)  Thanks. <comment56082> Do mean two mice connected at the same time?  Or one connected at a time, exchanging them as a test? <comment56195> Sorry. I wasn't clear. <comment56199> MacAir, OS Lion, one mouse at a time, same problem. Mouse 1 worked for a couple of weeks post upgrade, then light started to flicker and eventually went out. No light, no pointer movement. Scroll and right click work. Mouse 2 stopped working after one day (same outcome). Devices don't work on Windows now, but Control Panel say they are working correctly. <comment56242> Realized i forget the troubleshooting step you ALWAYS try first... Shut down MacAir and retried mouse. It worked - for 53 minutes!  Now, lights up for several seconds and then shuts off. [Shut down the Windows machine and other mouse works again on that.] <comment66603> *a previous post* â€” which post? (And if it's the same, then that smells like a duplicate?)
