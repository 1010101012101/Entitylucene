How do I remove the Finder from the Dock automatically at login? <body> This is related to this question here, except that, in addition to removing the Finder, I want to do it automatically. There are several solutions on the web that suggest using this AppleScript:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell UI element "Finder" of list 1 of process "Dock"         perform action "AXShowMenu"         click menu item "Remove from Dock" of menu 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  Unfortunately, saving this as an application and having it run at login doesn't work; interestingly, running it within codeScript Editor/code emdoes/em work, but this doesn't solve the problem of removing the Finder automatically.  <answer96177> The solution is to create a LaunchAgent (codeman launchctl/code for more info) that runs the above script via the command-line. Essentially, you want to store the script above in a file, say 'killfinder.scpt' and then run the command codeosascript /path/to/killfinder.scpt/code.   We want to do this automatically at login, so we use a LaunchAgent. Since I want to use this because I use Pathfinder and my wife doesn't, I'm going to put it in code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code, but if you want this to be system wide, put it in code/Library/LaunchAgents/code.  You will have three files:  ol listrongA UNIX script/strong/li listrongAn AppleScript/strong em(optional)/em/li listrongA LaunchAgent XML plist/strong/li /ol  h3Script File/h3  ol liPut this in an appropriate path. For example, I stored it in code~/dev/scripts/killfinder.bash/code./li liCreate the file and add this content:  precode#!/bin/bash osascript /path/to/AppleScriptFile.scpt /code/pre/li liMake sure the permissions are correct (i.e. codechmod ug+x killfinder.bash/code)/li /ol  h3AppleScript File/h3  You can call osascript directly with AppleScript code as an argument. I leave that as an exercise to the reader; in that case, you can creating this file. But if you want to do it this way: 1. Put this in an appropriate path. 2. Create the file and add this content:  precode    tell application "System Events"         tell UI element "Finder" of list 1 of process "Dock"             perform action "AXShowMenu"             click menu item "Remove from Dock" of menu 1         end tell     end tell /code/pre  ol liMake sure the permissions are correct (i.e. codechmod ugo+r Finder\ Remove.scpt/code)/li /ol  h3LaunchAgent XML plist/h3  ol liPut this in code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code or code/Library/LaunchAgents/code depending if you just want this behavior for your personal account or system-wide./li liCreate a file called codecom.&lt;whateveryouwant&gt;.KillFinder.plist/code with the following content:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;string&gt;com.&lt;whateveryouwant&gt;.KillFinder&lt;/string&gt;    &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;string&gt;/path/to/unixscript&lt;/string&gt;    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  It's important to make sure the 'string' value after the codeLabel/code key is correct as well as the path to the unix script./li /ol  Now all you have to do is exit and login and it should work!
