How can I E-mail multiple photos ? <body> How do I e-mail multiple Photos from MAC desktop with Yosemite? What is keyboard shortcut to select multiple images and e-mail them?  <answer194725> A keyboard shortcut might be difficult here (there might be other files on your desktop, or you don't want to send emall/em photos currently on the desktop.  I usually do  ul liselect all the photos I want to send (click on first, shift-click on all others)/li liright-click on one of them, select "Share" and then "Mail"/li liwait for the mail message with the photos to open in Mail (may take some seconds depending on the size and number of photos you've selected)/li lienter address, subject etc and send it off/li /ul  <answer194728> You can use 2 methods.  One is to hold the "shift" key that will select a continuous group from first to last click.  The other method is to selectively select them.  Click on the first one than HOLD the kbdcmd/kbd key and click on next one and so on while holding the cmd key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZsrUC.jpg" alt="email multiple"  When done selecting release the cmd key, right click on the selection and use the share- email.  Be aware that emailing to large files might fail.  In email check the size and decide if to make it smaller.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxZ0C.jpg" alt="email size"  Mail will tell you when to large so either select less or use the "Image size".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bv6wE.jpg" alt="size"
