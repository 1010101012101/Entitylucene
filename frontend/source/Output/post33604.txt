How to save an iTunes Podcast to a USB stick? <body> I have downloaded WWDC 2010 podcast from iTunes. How can I find the Podcast file and save it to a USB Memory stick so people who doesn't have iTunes can play it using quicktime?  <answer33605>    Right-Click on the file in iTunes, then select "Show in Finder"   There you have your Podcast-File. You can copy it on your USB-Drive or wherever you want!  <comment177651> In my memory an alt-drag also did the trick, but it seems not to work anymore.
