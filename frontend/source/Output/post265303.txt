Why can't I upgrade to Sierra <body> Mac mini Server Mid 2011 Processor: 2GHz Intel Core i7 Memory: 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB Software: Mac OS X Server Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)  I go in at itunes.apple.com/se/app/macos-sierra/id... and select "View in Mac App Store". In app store I then select "Download" (my password is entered if not already signed in) after that simply nothing happens.  Is this a known problem with a simple solution? Or is there anything I can do to get information on what goes wrong and trouble shoot this?  <comment332649> Can you download other applications? <comment332654> @patrix Seems like there's a problem here. I get some kind of blurred background with icons in front of it. The "Mahong" i tried says "Waiting..." and now it's some kind of progress bar under "Sierra", but now that screen has disappeared again. It looks like me and my mac is not on the same frequency...
