String and Variable concatenation not working in Applescript <body> I'm trying to concatenate at variable within a path name string to make this script more efficient. This is the code I have so far. But I can't seem to find the right syntax needed in order to set the  variable in the string.  precode    set vserver to POSIX file "/Volumes/johndoe"     set user to "johndoe" as string      set source to POSIX file "/Users/johndoe/Documents"      tell application "Finder"          duplicate source to vserver with replacing     end tell /code/pre  I want johndoe to be replaces by variable user to make the code more maintainable for the future. My ultimate goal is to be able to copy multiple home folders including: movies, pictures, documents etc... onto a shared server.  I tried doing this  precode"/Users/" &amp; user &amp; "/Desktop" /code/pre  But I received this error:       "Finder got an error: Handler canâ€™t handle objects of this class."   number -10010   <answer123595> If you run  precodeset user to "johndoe" set source to POSIX file "/Users/" &amp; user &amp; "/Documents" /code/pre  the result is  precode{file "Macintosh HD:Users:", "johndoe", "/Documents"} /code/pre  Just put parentheses around the path:  precodeset user to "johndoe" set source to POSIX file ("/Users/" &amp; user &amp; "/Documents") /code/pre  <comment144655> Thanks! that parenthesis is all I was missing!
