Move notes from account storage to local <body> So, I have my notes saved under a mail account: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NHoEz.png" alt="enter image description here"  and just today the mail server was out and my notes were all gone... Luckily the mail server got back up relatively fast and the notes were synced. But I want to avoid this in future and be on the safe side. So, how do I move them on local storage on the Mac?  Or even better - can I have them both locally and on the account storage?  <comment341320> Can you use iCloud?  I use it for my notes and it syncs them across all my iOS devices.
