Workflow Services not showing in Service Menu <body> All of a sudden my Automator services are no longer showing in the Service menu in Mail.  None of them.  All I see is codeNo Service Apply/code (grayed out).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3h8XA.png" alt="mail"  I know they still work, if I open them in Automator in they saved location (Services).  <comment156928> Are any of them selected in Services Preferences that are appropriate for the current context? How do you 'know they still work'? <comment156929> They are selected in Service Preferences, they work if I open them in they saved location. (Services) <comment156941> So it's just the Mail app? What do you currently have selected in the app? Does the list change if you try selecting some text in an email? <comment156952> tried that did not work :(
