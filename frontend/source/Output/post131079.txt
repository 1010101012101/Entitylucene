Get (tell) AXScrollArea in Applescript (Or, classes not appearing) <body> In my AppleScript I need to get the codeAXScrollArea/code on the left of Accessibility preferences. My first thought was to try using the codeAXRoleDescription/code, "scroll area", but it wouldn't compile.     syntax error: Expected end of line but found identifier.   shows on the line with "scroll area". This appears to be a problem  with methods/classes not being imported in general as things like codeclick/code show up as variables.  hr  This is my code so far:  precodetell application "System Preferences" to run  tell application "System Events" to tell application "System Preferences"     reveal (pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess")     tell window 1         tell scroll area 1          end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer131081> Quick fix:  Since System Preferences is the inner block, it disregards System Events "terms" (or keywords/classes/functions/routines etc.)  So you need to enclose it in this block:  precodeusing terms from application "System Events"     -- code here end using terms from /code/pre  hr  Although it's what I was technically asking, this isn't what I needed. I used codetell application/code instead of codetell process/code accidentally.  And here's the final script (I decided against the scroll area thing as anchors work better)  precode-- Toggles scrolling with the mouse tell application "System Preferences"     activate     reveal anchor "Mouse" of (pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess")     activate end tell tell application "System Events"     tell window 1 of process "System Preferences"         delay 0.1         click button "Mouse Optionsâ€¦"         click checkbox "Scrolling" of sheet 1     end tell     set visible of process "System Preferences" to false end tell /code/pre
