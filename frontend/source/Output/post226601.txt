Lost groups in Contacts after updating to El Capitan <body> I updated to OS X El Capitan and lost all my groups in contacts. I have been on the phone with Apple Support for 3 hours and can't restore the list of groups in my contacts. Can anyone help?  <answer227405> Open Contacts (your address book) select Preferences in the top left tool bar of your screen - go to Accounts and check the box for Enable This Account for the iCloud Card DAV on the left side of the accounts window. Your contacts and groups should all appear. Do a search for your groups in the address book if they don't automatically appear - worked for me. Good luck   <comment293714> Please specify if your Contacts are on iCloud.
