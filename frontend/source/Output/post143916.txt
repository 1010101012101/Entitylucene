Safari - Display Favicons In Favorites Bar <body> Is it possible to display favicons in Safari's Favorites Bar? For example, my Favorites Bar in Firefox looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qnBmd.png" alt="Favorites Bar"  I've tried using glims, but can't get it to do this.  <answer167559> I don't believe that it can be done as of in Safari 8.  In Chrome, you can simply remove the name associated with the site bookmark and it will only show the favicon in the Bookmarks Bar.  Unfortunately, doing this in Safari results in a bar of "NO_TITLE" instead.  <answer184509> As of Safari 8, favicons no longer show up on the tab bar, to my disappointment.  One solution is to use SafariStand &amp; EasySIMBL. Once installed (see instructions on the SafariStand site), open the SafariStand settings and check "Show Icon on Tab Bar". This will return favicons to the tabs.  <answer202783> I was looking for something similar as I use the Chrome bookmark bar in that way, but I couldn't find anything suitable. So I made an extension and have submitted it to Apple, Favicon Bar:   https://github.com/RoryCombe/FaviconBar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PDxCG.gif" alt="FavIcon Bar screenshot"  <comment169546> At present there is no way to add favicons to Safari's bookmarks bar. <comment190919> have you found a way to solve this? <comment190969> No, I have not. <comment298836> nice, but too bad you have to enter the links manually in the extension settings :( <comment363827> The link to FaviconBar is no longer working. <comment363857> @MichaelFulton Link updated
