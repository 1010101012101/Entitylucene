Hide windows in current desktop (Lion) <body> I'd like to make a keyboard shortcut that hides all windows on the current desktop, while ignoring windows on other desktops. Is this possible using Applescript?  <answer78970> Here is a suggestion (Works on OSX 10.8)   Using Automator :   ul liCreate a new Service with automator /li liSelect emService receives selected strongno input/strong in strongany application/em/strong/li liAdd a strongRun AppleScript/strong action /li /ul  Copy this script :   precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "System Events"         set processList to (every application process whose visible is true)                 repeat with appProc in processList             set windowList to every window of appProc             repeat with aWindow in windowList                 click (third button of aWindow)             end repeat         end repeat     end tell end run /code/pre  ul liSave your new service/li liIn System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services add a keyboard shortcut to your news ervice/li /ul  Edit :   Other script :   precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Finder"         set visible of every process whose visible is true and name is not "Finder" to false         close every window     end tell end run /code/pre  It hides all apps but it strongcloses/strong all finder windows.  <comment91672> So does this work because only the buttons of windows in the current desktop are clickable? Ideally I'd like the windows to be hidden instead of minimized, ie visible = false. <comment91673> You can't hide a window but you can hide an app. And hiding a app = hiding its windows in every space. <comment91738> That's fine, I don't have any app windows on multiple desktops. Sorry my terminology is wrong/misleading <comment91750> See my edit, I proposed an other script <comment91754> I started with something very similar, but it hides all apps on all desktops/spaces instead of just the current one. I'm not sure it's possible to do what I want to do :/
