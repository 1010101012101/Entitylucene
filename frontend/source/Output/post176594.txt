Is it possible to download the previous version of OneNote for mac <body> I cannot upgrade to Yosemite- company policy- but would still love to use OneNote. Does anyone know a link where I can download the older version? thanks  <comment208648> Have you checked App Store purchase tab ? If you have Mavericks, then there must be a Mavericks version. <comment208875> Thanks you Pratika. I tried your suggestion but it just takes me to the newest version. I'll stop on a Microsoft store later. <comment268299> Yes, from the Purchases tab, I can go ahead and download the older version. Thank you..
