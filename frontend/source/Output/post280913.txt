Tar excluding ._ files <body> Is there a way to create a tar file in OS X (Sierra, preferably) that does not include the ._ files?  I've tried using the --exclude option, but clearly don't know the right pattern to use.  <answer280916> To suppress the creation of AppleDouble code._/code files, use: code--disable-copyfile/code  Example: codetar --disable-copyfile -cf file.tar file/code  <comment353377> What exactly have you tried? Please add the command line used to the question <comment353378> What filesystem are you one ._ files are not usually there on HFS+
