Automator Action/Bash Script for selecting files from a list <body> As a part of my workflow, I often face this scenario:  ul liI have a folder with let's say, 100 files named 1.mov to 100.mov/li liI have a list of strongvalid files/strong let's say, files 1.mov, 2.mov .... 15.mov (These names can be random)/li /ul  Now I want finder to separate the valid files from the heap of original files by either marking them or creating a new folder and copying them recursively.  How can I achieve this with automator?  <answer244412> Given a text file, strongfilelist.txt/strong, containing the files enumerated, one per line, the following command will move those files (and only those files) found in the current directory and beneath it, to a directory, strongdestination/strong, located in the user's Documents folder:  precodexargs -J % find . -name % -exec mv {} ~/Documents/destination/ \; &lt; filelist.txt /code/pre  emxargs/em: accepts the files listed coming from stdin (or in this case, filelist.txt), replacing their path into the % variable in the following emfind/em command  emfind/em: locates those files if they exist, then strongexec/strongutes the following command on each file  emmv/em: moves the found file, represented by {}, to the destination  Incorporating this line into an Automator workflow is left to the reader.
