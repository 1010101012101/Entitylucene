The scale doesn't appear to be linear.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4nrNR.png" width="300"  My question is: strongIs the Health App Graph Logarithmic?/strong  <answer155476> It doesn't look logarithmic to me.   Rounding the Steps figures, 20k peak, average 10k - the 10k line is half way up the scale, give or take.br If it were logarithmic it would be significantly off-centre.   I think it shows some non-colour-differentiated headroom above the high-point, which might be giving the impression it's not linear.  On my own phone, my high-point is about 3x my daily average. Allowing for that 'header' space above the high-point, my average line is showing as about â…“ of the way up the scale; confirming my impression that it is linear, plus a header.
