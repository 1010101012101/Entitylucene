Are there keyboard shortcuts for emoji on a bluetooth keyboard for iOS? <body> I've recently started using a bluetooth keyboard with my iPad. I was wondering if there are any keyboard shortcuts for emoji ? Switching to the on screen keyboard is possible but forces me to take my fingers off the hardware keyboard and tap the screen which is a huge waste of time. On Mac the autocorrect replaces stuff "&lt;3" with their emoji equivalent but iOS doesn't seem to do that.  Regards.  <answer281639> I've found a workaround using the "text replacement" feature. In Settings - General - Keyboard - Text replacement, you can add the emoji and assign them their equivalent text-based shortcuts, like in the screenshot below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qF4s3.png" alt="Screenshot"  <comment354364> Those replacement lists ought to sync between Mac & iOS over iCloud, so you can use the same on both.
