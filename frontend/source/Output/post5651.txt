Stopping a macports installed mysql daemon <body> I'm trying to reset my root password on a macports installed MySQL on OS X. But none of the ways to do this that I can find works, for various reasons. One reason common to all is that I can't stop the mysql deamon.  As I understand it, I should be able to stop it with  precodesudo launchctl stop org.macports.mysql5 /code/pre  Which makes absolutely no difference. No error message, nothing. Is launchd really this sucky, or do I misuse it? Reasonably it should give me an error when it fails, but nope, nothing.  Trying to kill the processes with kill -9 just makes them restart again, so that doesn't work either.  I also tried   precodesudo launchctl unload org.macports.mysql5 /code/pre  But that gives me this error:  precodelaunchctl: Couldn't stat("org.macports.mysql5"): No such file or directory /code/pre  (And I must confess I don't understand what "Unload configuration files and/or directories" means, which is what the Unload command apparently does according to the little docs I can find).  So, what now?  <answer5653> The correct answer is   precodesudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql5.plist /code/pre  And you start it with   precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql5.plist /code/pre  Thanks to kh13org for the pointer.  <comment192195> The file name may be slightly different.  For example, on my system, the name is `/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql55-server.plist`.
