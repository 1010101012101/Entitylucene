Deleting transferred purchases from iTunes cache <body> I'm using a long-lived installation of MacOS X alongside with an iPhone and iPad. Because of backups of both devices and the purchased applications, I'm losing a considerable space (~14GB) in my system.  Is it safe to delete the transferred files (from finder, terminal, etc.) or is there a way to do it from iTunes.  <answer107219> To delete Apps from iTunes just go to the Apps section of iTunes.br Select the desired Apps(cmd+click for multiple selection) and cmd+backspace to delete the files.  Your purchases will not be gone, since you can always download them again from the iTunes Store.  <comment125729> Which "transferred" files are you referring to here? The installed applications, documents you transfer to your iDevice via iTunes or something else? <comment125862> The applications that iTunes backs up from your device to save time if ever you ever decide to uninstall an app and re-install later (using iTunes). <comment125865> Thanks a lot. It did the trick.
