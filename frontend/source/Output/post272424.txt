Compressor Plugin for Audio Output of Mac <body> When I am watching movies (mostly on Amazon Prime) on my MacBook Pro (early 2011) I sometimes would wish a more even sound level throughout the movie, i.e. less difference in volumes (e.g. gunfire and whispering dialogue). Is there any way to compress the output audio (preferably on OS level) of my MacBook? Any Apps, Plug-ins etc.?  <comment342442> [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) is the go-to app for anything like this. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/203004/nice-audio-mixer-repeater/203009#203009 & http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/271164/split-input-channels-using-soundflower-and-aulab/271194#271194 for some idea of what it's capabilities are. <comment342700> thanks, Audio Hijack seems to be indeed very powerful! But is there maybe a less functional, free of charge tool/app? <comment342711> None that I know of. SoundFlower is/was the tool for routing, but it doesn't have any plugin structure to add the actual compressor
