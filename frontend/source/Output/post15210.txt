How to increase "tracking speed" beyond the maximum? <body> For a Macbook Pro, I've set trackpad settings for strongThree Fingers/strong to "Dragging":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXGqG.png" alt="enter image description here"  However the tracking speed is too slow, and often it's impossible to drag for a larger distance due to the size of the physical trackpad.  How do we increase the tracking speed beyond the maximum allowed?  <answer15215> Mouse Curves is a preference pane that allows you to customize the tracking speed of the mouse and trackpad.   http://triq.net/mac/mouse-acceleration-preference-pane-mac-os-x  <answer15217> BetterTouchTool does that, and lets you add application specific gestures as well!  I don't think I could use a mac without it, at this point. I have my browser-tab-management and finder shortcuts mapped to multitouch gestures.   <answer15487> The value of the preference is stored in code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code and can be changed with something like codedefaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.scaling -float 5.0/code. The normal maximum value is currently code3.0/code. Applying the changes requires logging out and back in.  <answer15489> Ordinary trackpad-dragging can be done in segments, the same way mouse-dragging can be done in limited space, by lifting &amp; repositioning {the mouse; your fingers} and making another swipe.  In your prefpane, enable one-finger click and drag, and you won't even need to press down.  <answer55431> If you turn inertial scrolling on, you can, once you've started a drag gesture, keep two fingers steady and flick with the other one to inertially "drag" the window around your screen(s).  <comment151084> It is under `Basic Settings`  `Magic Mouse`  `Set mouse speed`.  It is amazing! <comment227561> Perfect, perfect tool. Like you, I can't use my mac without it. Thanks :). Love it <comment365221> For those who come here searching for mouse speed up (as me) change the above command/property to `com.apple.mouse.scaling`. So `defaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling -float 5.0` is what you're looking for.
