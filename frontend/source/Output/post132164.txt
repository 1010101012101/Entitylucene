AppleScript to save active Microsoft Word document IFF there is one <body> I use this with Keyboard Maestro to automatically save the front-most document in Microsoft Word whenever Word deactivates:  precodetell application "Microsoft Word"     if it is running then         save active document     end if end tell /code/pre  This works great emunless/em there is not an active document, in which case it throws an error.  strongI know I could emignore/em the error, but I would rather not./strong  I would like to know if there’s a proper AppleScript way to say something like “If active document exists, then save it.”  I tried Googling but only found this (what I have now).  <answer132171> You need to query Word for the count of codedocument/code objects – codeactive document/code is just a convenience shortcut to the frontmost one in that list. Unluckily, Word’s somewhat peculiar AppleScript implementation does not return an empty list object when there is no open document, but codemissing value/code (AppleScript’s take on codenil/code) instead. Taking that into account, the following function queries Word for open documents:  precodeon hasDocument()   tell application "Microsoft Word"     every document is not missing value   end tell end /code/pre  – put that in front of your script and change your conditional to codeif it is running and my hasDocument()/code and you should be fine.  <comment155363> Awesome! Thanks! I have updated the gist at https://gist.github.com/tjluoma/ca9bcbe0d905a759442f
