I am using OS X Yosemite, I was wondering if there is any solution that can allow me to connect to a SSTP based VPN.   For the record, I have already tried using EasyVPN, iSSTP, iSSTP2. all of which failed to connect, and they all seem to be not supported anymore.  <answer247282> I think you will find Tunnelblick will do it without any problems. It's well supported and has good documentation on the site.  <answer253764> Your best bet is iSSTP - a SSTP client for Mac OS X.     This is a sstp GUI client for Mac, use a modified sstp-client as backend which support server-name TLS extension.
