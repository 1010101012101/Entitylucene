What is the content of the unsubscribe message? <body> Introduced in iOS 10, a standard message for unsubscribing can be sent in a couple of taps from any Mail message that was sent to a list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c0YED.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Since this feature allows the Mail app to send an email on my behalf and from my e-mail address (I suppose), I would love to know what message the recipient receives.  <answer252813> It'll not send an e-mail, it'll just try to find an unsubscribe link and activate it.  <comment314535> http://www.list-unsubscribe.com/
