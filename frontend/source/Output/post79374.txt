Is swipe to archive possible with non-Gmail account in iOS? <body> Is it possible to configure which folder to put mail in when swiping on a email to archive/delete with a non-Gmail account?  My objective with this would be to file email into an archive more easily than tapping Edit-Move-ArchiveFolder. This is currently possible when you set up a Gmail account on your device but not with other accounts.   <answer79472> I have been looking for an answer to that for some time now. So far the only suggestion I was told was to try Sparrow for iOS, which does just that  <answer80542> First change the location of deleted items for the non-Gmail account, under codeSettings &gt; Mail &gt; Account &gt; Advanced/code. Afterwards, when you swipe and Delete, the "deleted" messages should go to your selected folder.  <answer103869> This can now be accomplished very easily in iOS 7.  em(n.b. The following assumes that you have already setup your account on the iOS device. These steps described are for a generic IMAP account.

I did wonder whether this was going to be implemented for accounts other than the 'gmail' type account. <comment126058> Thanks for step 9 (exiting configuration screen).  I'm so used to all settings taking effect immediately that I couldn't figure out what went wrong <comment126254> @huyz - YUP. The same thing kept happening to me, which is why I mentioned it. If you try to install a personal certificate for email accounts you might run into the same thing. I'm not used to having to 'save' preferences, especially going BACK to a previous screen. Very non-intuitive. <comment226846> URL in answer is dead
