Macbook air locked <body> I have a macbook air on my desk. It was from a coworker who got fired. He had his personal iCloud configured on this device. I disabled wifi so that we could still access company data on the device since I could not remove the icloud account from the device without the (his) password. I could not format the device because there is data on it which we need. Another coworker forgot about the find my mac option and the remote lock feature and he turned on wifi... so now I am stuck with:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjSIh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I would like to point out that the device is not stolen. It is owned by the company which I work for and we need access to the corp. data which is on the SSD. I could take the invoice and go to a mac store, but would like to solve it myself. Please let me know if it is possible or that the mac store is the only option (or perhaps format disk as only option)  strongedit/strong command+r boot and command+option+p+r boot both give me a white lock with text input below...  <comment301753> You won't be able to unlock it yourself unless you know the code. Going to an Apple store and giving proof that the MacBook is not stolen(a receipt) seems like the best solution in your situation. <comment301759> Thank you @Spade will lookup the invoice and travel to the nearest store (90km) will update this thread when I have more info or if people have given me other options to try. <comment301765> Why wasn't the corporate property seized and verified to be accessible without issues before the employee was fired? Is the corporate data backed up? If not, then under circumstance, why wasn't it immediately backed up? Then the system could have been wiped and reset before putting it back into service. <comment301768> It was seized and accessible. until the WiFi was turned on ;) we ask employees to turn on time machine, but it is their own responsibility (lesson learned). We did make backups on a thumb-drive, but might need more data for lawsuits to justify him being fired. <comment301770> Is the drive encrypted, e.g., using FileVault?  If not maybe the drive can be removed and imaged in full, and retained if necessary, but at the least to recover data.
