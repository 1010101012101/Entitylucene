Battlefield 2 via CrossOver: Graphic Bug With High Terrain <body> I'm trying to play Battlefield 2 with CrossOver on 10.7.4 but it produces a graphic glitch:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oEkW6.jpg" alt="Battlefield 2: Graphic Glitch"  I've already checked the software updates for new graphic-divers but can't find any anything. Is there maybe a way to update the drivers without the code"Software Update..."/code seclection from ï£¿? Does anyone have ideas how to fix this?  Thanks for every answer!  <answer54810> Unlike on a Windows gaming machine you don't have many choices to fix such issues on a Mac. As far as I know there are no dedicated drivers sections on the NVIDIA or ATI pages and no possible beta-drivers from Apple.  After a couple of years I ended up with a separate Bootcamp partition for the gaming fun because (forgive the harsh words) all the CrossOver, Wine, whatever crap sucks! Take a look in the AppStore and see the comments on Civ V as an example. Even the relatively smooth running and still good looking Eve Online has some glitches.  Sorry for the negative mood, but I think we'll have to wait some more years to see more 'native' mainstream games like Starcraft.  <comment62817> I've already had the idea, but the problem is I have already Ubuntu as second OS on my Mac and there isn't much space left.
