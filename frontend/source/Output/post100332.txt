How can I change a smart folder's icon without changing the default icon? <body> I want to add a smart folder for each label in the sidebar (I believe there is no way to directly to add the labels, so I have to resort to smart folder). However, all of them have the gear icon in the sidebar, even if I changed its icon and the icon is correctly shown in finder itself.  Note that I am NOT changing the smart folder's default icon, I just want to change them to a red, green, blue ... dots, just like the labels.  How can I achieve this?  More info: Changing the icon itself does not affect sidebar look. I tried to change to a red circle:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kgxbe.png" alt="How it looks like in fider."

You can't (unless there's a third party tool about which I am unfamiliar). However, you can change the default icons to your heart's content. Here's how:  As a test, I created a Smart Folder that finds all PDFs in my home directory. The default glyph for the Smart Folder is a gear, as noted in the OP.  Here are the steps to change the glyph:  ul liLocate the directory code/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/code/li liLocate the file called codeSidebarSmartFolder.icns/code/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/shDBs.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liRename it to codeSidebarSmartFolder_old.icns/code/li liPaste into codeResources/code folder the glyph you want to use in its place./li liRename it to codeSidebarSmartFolder.icns/code/li liReboot your Mac./li /ul  You'll see now that my Smart Folder glyph in the sidebar has changed to the new one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LYRSS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment118125> I would think this should work, but it doesn't change the glyph in the Finder sidebar. <comment118152> Per the question he is not looking to change the default Smart Folder icon, which is what these steps do. <comment118154> Did you kill Finder and restart it? Hold down Option, right click on the Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch. <comment118155> That depends on your interpretation. The explanation does say that he does not wish to change the icon, but the question clearly says "Change Smart Folder's Icon". <comment118160> Now that the OP changed the question, that changes my answer. I'll edit it accordingly. (Interesting that I was modded down for.... erm, answering the actual question. Strange, that.) <comment118178> I don't think I changed anything... However your method will still make smart folders have the SAME icon, while I want them to have different ones, i.e., red, blue, green circles. <comment118179> I already tried this, however the icon shown in the sidebar is not changed. <comment118180> Yes, I am aware of that. Thus, my qualifier... you can't, but you CAN change the icon. <comment118211> As far as I'm concerned you can't change the sidebar icons, which really annoys me since they removed the icons for sites and library <comment118243> How funny... it works for me. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18885/test.png  I use Mountain Lion though... <comment302700> Yes, unfortunetely this stopped working with Mavericks. :(
