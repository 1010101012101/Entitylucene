Connecting iPad2 to composite av cable <body> Is there anyway that I can connect my iPad2 device which has micro usb(lightning) port to a TV using AV cable? Is there a way? I bought (imported from US to India) a cable from Amazon which I thought I can use to connect the device to TV using that cable but seems it can be used only with newer devices whith 30-pin ports. Is my money just a waste? Is there a way I connect to TV using any other convertor or any other cable to connect direccly is availale in the market?  Note: The lighting to 30-pin converter wont work as it clearly says it can't output video.  <comment274752> Lightning is NOT micro-USB. You might want to try this [30-pin to Lightning](http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Lightning-Adapter-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B009A5EIWC) connector <comment274798> See my note I mentioned the issue already
