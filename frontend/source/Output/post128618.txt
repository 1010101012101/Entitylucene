How can I reset the service battery warning? <body> I learned from one of my other questions that the "Service Battery" warning will limit your CPU power and slow your computer down - this is a problem I've been having with my MacBook Pro.   I have 906 cycles on it but I'm still getting good life and unfortunately, I don't have time to go to get my battery replaced ATM since it's the middle of exam season for me.   Resetting the SMC gets me going for a while with full CPU speed, but then it slows down again.  How can I disable this warning and get my computer back for the next week?  <answer128684> The bad news is you can not reset the cycle counter, it is a part of battery circuit. Your battery is at its end of life (EOL).  h2Temperature/h2  How to keep battery running just a bit longer, strongkeep it cold./strong  Do not have your laptop on your lap even if the name says so.
