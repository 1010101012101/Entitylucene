Adding Mac-specific directory to PATH when home is shared <body> My /home/myusername/ directory is provided through a network, and looks exactly the same on my Linux machine and my Mac Mini.   I'd like to add to PATH a directory of Mac-specific software in my home, e.g. /home/myusername/SW/bin_mac/ and have this happen only when I'm doing command line stuff on the Mac, and not have PATH contain this when on Linux.  If I edit .bashrc (or tcsh's equivalent) it'll affect PATH in both cases.  What are some tricks to do this?  <answer16747> Test the output of codeuname/code; it will be codeDarwin/code on OS X and codeLinux/code on Linux.  precodeif [[ $(uname) == Darwin ]]; then     export PATH="$HOME/SW/bin_mac:$PATH" fi /code/pre  Alternately, you could just add an appropriate directory on each machine, which will be useful if you find yourself needing a separate Linux codebin/code directory as well in the future.  precodeexport PATH="$HOME/SW/bin_$(uname):..." /code/pre  and either codemv/code or codeln -s/code your codebin_mac/code to codebin_Darwin/code; then you can create a codebin_Linux/code directory in the future if you need it, and it'll just work.  (You could also test code$HOSTTYPE/code, which is set by codebash/code, but it contains more information than you're likely to need.)  <comment18306> The second solution looks great - a tidy one liner, and yes I may need to deal with multiple platforms and more than just PATH.
