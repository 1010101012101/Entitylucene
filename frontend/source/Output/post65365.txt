How to fix Quicktime error -2048 (doesn't understand file format)? <body> I recently transferred a movie made on iMovie from my iPad to my PC. It's a big file I transferred with Photo Transfer App. On the PC, Quicktime refuses to play the file. It gives error -2048 specifying that the file is not a format Quicktime understands.  Does anybody know what I could do to get around this problem?  <comment228630> Btw, nice error code
