mac mail logo in signature looks blurred <body> I've put logo inside mac mail signature, but it looks blurry. Its seems like a retina problem, so what I did is this:  inside dir code~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData/Signatures/code I modified the code.mailsignature/code file inside I halved the size of the img width and height - problem is mac mail overwrites it with correct image dimensions whenever I open mac client after edit.  any other tricks you know of?  I want to have 120/100 size image halved (downscaled) to 60/50 so it displays well on retina.
