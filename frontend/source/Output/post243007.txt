One monitor out of 2 does not work (dual mini-Display) <body> I have 2 external displays connected to my MBP via two MiniDisplay port adapters for DVI cables. Sometimes when I unplug them, then plug them back in, only 1 display is recognized. When this display is unplugged and plugged back in, the screen becomes "scrambled", and computer becomes non-responsive. The only solution is to power it off.  What is going on?  I have a Macbook Pro 15" Mid 2015, OS X El Capitan version 10.11.5  <comment299135> I had similar issues with a MBP 15" Late 2013 and a miniDP - DisplayPort Adapter. Sometimes plugging in the external screen resulted in a kernel panic, sometimes only scrambled image (even after wake to sleep), sometimes it just worked well. It turned out that the adapter had a fault, switching to a new one resolved all the problems. <comment299232> @Tetsujin [You sure?](http://superuser.com/questions/222205/is-it-safe-to-hot-plug-a-dvi-cable) I've never heard that before, but you could well be right. <comment299336> @Tetsujin ...odd, that's superuser.com... <comment299478> @Tetsujin Ah, that's dead for me too.
