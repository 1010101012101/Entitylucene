Blackboard theme for iPad Keynote <body> I'm creating a presentation with my MacBook Pro and Keynote.  I'm using the theme Blackboard which uses the font Chalkboard. When I import the presentation on my iPad Mini via iCloud the default font becomes Chalkduster and the presentation is messed up.  I noticed that the font Chalkboard is present in the iPad, however it would take a lot to change all the text fonts manually.  Why does the iPad Keynote change the font? Is there a way to prevent it?  <answer79163> Actually my problem was that emBlackboard/em on OSx uses emChalkboard/em while on iOS use emChalkboard SE/em.  So I had to change all the fonts form emChalkboard/em to emChalkboard SE/em.
