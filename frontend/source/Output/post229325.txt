Sudden, auto-shutdown while in sleep: where to look for the culprit? <body> My MacBook has been brutally shutting down by itself while in sleep. It always happens a few hours after shutting down the lid, right when switching to the StandBy sleep mode, right at the following line in the logs:     kernel[0]: ARPT: 65547.227633: IOPMPowerSource Information: onSleep,   SleepType: Standby,  'ExternalConnected': No, 'TimeRemaining': 7367   (other SleepTypes are fine).  What could be the culprit, and how can this be investigated? The computer's hardware diagnostic program does not find any program, and the computer does not auto-shutdown anymore if I erase the drive and reinstall OSÂ X (it auto-shutdowns if I reinstall OS X but don't erase the drive). Any idea would be much appreciated!  strongPS/strong: I learned that some colleagues have the exact same problem after installing AirWatch. This seems to be the culprit. That said, any information about how I could investigate the problem more could help!  <comment279741> If you already know that erasing the drive and reinstalling OS X fixes the issue then what's the problem? <comment280241> Just all the packages and software and customizations that are on top OS X and that would be tedious (and difficult) to redo. :)
