MacMail client getting notifications from Google+ in Chinese - why? <body> For some reason all notifications from Google+ are coming through in Chinese when sent to my dad's @mac.com email address (when accessed on iPhone, iPad or on his regular Apple computer). When the same notifications are sent to his Gmail email address, they come through correctly in English. Other emails sent to his Mac account are also in English - this phenomenon seems to be limited to Google+ notifications.   Any ideas what's going on?
