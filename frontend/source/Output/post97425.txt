how can I enable IOS6 tethering without jailbreaking my Sprint iphone 4s phone? <body> I know that you can enable tethering for an IOS6 iphone by jail breaking it and then installing additional tethering software but how can I enable IOS6 thetering without jailbreaking my Sprint iphone 4s phone? I am aware that you can pay extra to get the "Mobile Share Plan" but I am not interested in paying extra for this service since I am already paying for unlimited data.  <answer97447> You need to have the "Mobile Share Plan" enabled first from your phone service provider. To see if you have it, find codePersonal Hotspot/code. It should be in codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Network -&gt; Cellular Data Network/code. Please see this article for more information.   Like I said, if you do not see the option for Personal Hotspot, confirm with your carrier that this feature is supported and your wireless plan is configured for Personal Hotspot.  <comment114329> I am aware that you can pay extra to get the "Mobile Share Plan" but I am not interested in paying extra for this service since I am already paying for unlimited data.  I will add this to the question.
