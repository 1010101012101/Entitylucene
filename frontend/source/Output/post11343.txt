How can I deactivate an jailbroken iOS? <body> Sometimes the codeactivation/code option from the PwnageTool does bring your GSM in an unusable state if you have and iPhone that is locked to other network than AT&amp;T.  All I remember is that it was a tool that I installed using Cydia that was able to deactivate the phone.  <answer11349> You should disable activation (it's hacktivation) when jailbreaking if your phone is unlocked (or locked to your carrier).  In strongPwnageTool/strong you should choose codeExpert/code and deselect the codeActivate the phone/code checkbox.
