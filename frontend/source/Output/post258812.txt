Error : unknown file system while trying to install Debian on my Mac mini <body> I'm running Mac OS X 10.6.8 on a Mac mini 2.1. The hard disk is 80 GB and the first half is occupied by the Mac OS X and on the second half I'm trying to install Debian. I tried to follow a lot of different tutorials and two Linux distros:   ol lidebian-mac-8.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso/li lidebian-mac-8.6.0-i386-netinst.iso/li /ol  Also, I've installed rEFIt and/or rEFInd, but nothing. The error I get is always the same:   precodestatus: got partition of type "unknown" found,will not touch this disk. Error: not found returned from gptsync.efi.  /code/pre  I get this error when I do "start partitioning tool" from rEFIt. And also another error:  precodeerror: unknown filesystem. /code/pre  So, after 3 days of hard work, I don't know what to do.

This partitioning was part of the Debian installer. I did not encounter the same problems you have reported.   I am not sure why you are using rEFIt and/or rEFInd. I did not need to.  Some of the steps I took:  ul liI burned the file "debian-mac-8.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso" to a RW DVD using the Disk Utility application. The OS X was Yosemite. I assume Snow Leopard would work the same./li liI did not need rEFIt or rEFInd to start the installation. I just restarted the Mac and held down the option key to invoke the Startup Manager. Next, I inserted the DVD and waited for the DVD icon labeled "EFI boot" to appear. Finally I select this icon to boot from./li liI choose the "Graphical install" option when prompted./li liMy connection to the internet is hardwired, so I did not have to configure wireless settings./li liThe installer did not have the software for Broadcom wireless hardware in my Mac. I instructed the installer to bypass this problem./li /ul  Perhaps you could modify your question to include the output from the following Terminal application commands. These commands will not change your Mac. The commands just give me a better understanding of how your drive is partitioned.  precodediskutil list sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  <comment323614> Were you able to boot to a live image? <comment323618> Are you using an optical drive, USB flash drive or other method to install? <comment323622> yes,from the cd-dvd reader,but not from the usb stick. <comment323623> I tried using the cd-dvd optical driver most of the time. <comment323632> My computer is a mid 2007 iMac. Your computer is a mid 2007 mac mini. I am burning debian-mac-8.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso to a RW DVD. I will see if I can recreate your problem. I have Yosemite (0S X 10.10), El Capitan (OS X 10.11) and 64 bit Windows 10 installed. <comment323731> I added the information you requested as a picture on the main post.
