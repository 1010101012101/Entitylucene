Operation failed when I tried to create a partition <body> I'm trying to create a partition in following "Part 2: Preparing your Mac" from this website. I have to create "Ubuntu Boot Loader" in selecting the principal hard drive "APPLE SSD AP0512J Media", select codePartition/code - code+/code - codeName : Ubuntu Boot Loader/code - codeFormat : Mac OS Extended (Journaled)/code - codeSize: 128 MB/code, but I got the following error with Disk Utility :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3JwZl.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/333vS.png" alt="enter image description here"  I got the following message when I hit "Show Details" :      Running operation 1 of 1…   Checking prerequisites for resizing Logical-Physical volume stack   The requested size change for the target disk or a related disk is too small. Please try a different disk or partition, or make a larger change.   Operation failed…   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tXVeT.png" alt="enter image description here"  Could anyone be able to tell what do I have to do to fix the "Operation failed"?  <answer263556> Like it says in the error box, strongtry making a bigger partition/strong. The partition you are trying to create is only 128 mb. Even though it says create a 128MB partition(in the guide), it wouldn't cause any problems to increase the size of the partition since there are errors for creating a partition of the size 128MB.  <comment330199> Did you see the website? I have to create two partition : one of 128MB and another with at least 50GB <comment330203> @SandraRoss Updated my answer <comment330238> Glad things are sorted out.
