How to change MacBook Pro color sampling to 4:2:0? <body> Sorry for the noob question, but I'm attempting to connect my MacBook Pro to a 4k UDH TV, and have tried several cable configurations to no luck :(  Macbook Pro: 15" Retina El Capitan with Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB   TV (just in case): LG 43" UHD with 4k @ 60hz  I want to try altering the color sampling to 4:2:0, but can't do so on the TV, so I assume it's a laptop configuration?  Appreciate ANY suggestions!  <comment315080> What have you done on the mac to try to resolve this, if any? Also, are you trying to extend or mirror the external monitor? <comment315181> I bought two new cables - mini DP 1.2 to HDMI 2.0 adapter, and an AmazonBasics cable that supposedly supports bandwidth up to 18gbps. I googled around online quite a bit, but it seems quite difficult to find an exact solution without experimenting.
