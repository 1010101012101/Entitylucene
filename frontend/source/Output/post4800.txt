Can I backup iTunes 9 before upgrading to iTunes 10? <body> I am happy with iTunes 9 and am a bit leery of upgrading to iTunes 10 on my Mac based on some feedback I've heard from others. Can I duplicate codeiTunes.app/code in my Applications folder prior to running Software Update to update to iTunes 10, and use the backup iTunes to run iTunes 9 if I am not happy with iTunes 10? I know this works with some applications like Final Cut Pro but not with others like Safari.  <answer4853> Don't see why not.  If you're paranoid, you may also want to backup the iTunes prefs (code~/Library/com.apple.itunes*/code), and/or any config files you find in your iTunes music folder (code~/Music/iTunes//code in my case).  <answer5019> I just did this and I can confirm that it did work. However as Harv said, if you do this make a backup of the old files, specifically your library, as iTunes 10 will upgrade your "iTunes Library" file and iTunes 9 will refuse to read it.
