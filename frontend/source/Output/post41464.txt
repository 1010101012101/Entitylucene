Can't I use different WiFi networks for different Locations? <body> I'm having trouble understanding what I'm doing wrong here: I'm trying to set up two network Locations, one for my home network via my cable modem and a second for WiFi tethering via my mobile phone. What I'd like to be able to do is change the Location (under the Apple menu  codeLocation/code) and have my Mac automatically connect to the proper WiFi network: either my home network SSID or my WiFi tethering SSID.  I defined two locations, switched between them, and set the preferred network list for each location. But when I change the preferred network list for one Location, it changes the list for the other Location as well!  Am I doing something wrong or is it really not possible to maintain a separate list of Preferred Networks for each network Location? It seems doubtful it's not possible since just about every other netrok setting depends on the location...  I am using OS X 10.7.2.  <answer41479> The Sidekick app (which used to be called NetworkLocation) is an ideal tool for automating changes based on the location of your Mac. It's a veritable swiss army knife of tools, works well in Lion and has plug ins and terminal support for extending it should the built in tools not cover your additional use cases. For simple network location changes, you are covered with this app.  <comment47027> You could do this in Snow Leopard, but Lion must store the preferred networks differently because it no longer works. <comment47029> That sucks! Another downside of Lion :-(
