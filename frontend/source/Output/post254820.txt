Apple Hardware Test (AHT) error 4ROM/4/40000000 <body> Recently my Mid. 2012 MacBook Pro 9.2 (i7, 2.9GHz, 8GB ram) just shut down. Some artefacts appeared on-screen before it shut down. Then the computer went into a state of beeping three times, 5 seconds silence, and repeat. When I hold down the Power button for some seconds, the beeping stops.  I can then wait a couple of minutes, and the computer boots, gives a grey screen stating that the Mac was shut down, and boots normally. Then the Mac crashes again, I wait a couple of minutes, and I am now able to use my Mac normally.  I reset the NVRAM and SMC, and ran an extended AHT giving me this code: 4ROM/4/40000000. It's hard to find any useful information about what this means, or what I can do. I may need to send it in for repair, but the computer now works normally.
