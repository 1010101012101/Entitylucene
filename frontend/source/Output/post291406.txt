Emails being replace to Holiday in the United States? <body> I recently started noticing that my emails were being replace to "Holidays in the United States" on the default Apple mail app. This is annoying because now I have to send emails from the browser. My name is correct in settings, does anyone know how to fix this?  I am on macOS Sierra.  <answer291408> This has been a bug with Apple mail for a very long time (Funny because the issue just came back to me today). There isn't a clear solution for this issue, but I just go ahead and refer to this thread when I get this issue:  ul liMy gmail name comes up as Holidays in the United States/li /ul  What seems to be the issue is the syncing with Google Calendars. Variations of this bug can be found when your name is changed to one of your contacts.
