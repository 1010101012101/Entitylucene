How to prevent holding fn key from downloading Enhanced Dictation? <body> I use my Macbook Pro with an external keyboard when coding, so I can use function keys as normal function keys for use with and IDE when coding. This means in order to adjust brightness and volume I need to hold down the "fn" key. So I'm hitting this fairly frequently. If you hit it twice though, (or sometimes it seems to be if you hold it down, maybe) this dialog shows up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZDt2J.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's super annoying and I seem to cause it several times a day. I never want this, can't dismiss it with a keystroke, and can't find where to kill it in Keyboard Preferences. Any ideas? Thanks.  <answer213967> h3Turn off Dictation in System Preferences or change shortcut key to something else./h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OU01i.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRnC9.png" alt="enter image description here"
