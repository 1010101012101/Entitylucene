Configure VPN so it doesn't fall back to unencrypted <body> I use a VPN when connecting to the Internet via open Wifi.  I use Apple's built-in VPN client.  However, occasionally my VPN connection will drop.  When this happens, Apple's built-in VPN client automatically falls back to unencrypted mode: it falls back to sending my traffic out unencrypted over the Wifi connection.  This isn't good, because it means my traffic is now unencrypted -- and usually I don't notice until substantially later.  Is there a way to prevent this?  Can the built-in VPN  client be configured so it won't fall back to unencrypted mode (e.g., automatically re-connecting, and blocking network traffic until it has successfully re-connected)?  I was reminded of this by the following recent news article: Even with a VPN, open Wi-Fi exposes users.  <comment227397> Unfortunately my suggestion of turning off IPV4 on the WIFI connection does not work. I just forgot, that you will need a working internet connection to establish any VPN connection. (That's why I deleted that post again.) The only solution may be a firewall that only allows connections to your VPN server and Internet through VPN.
