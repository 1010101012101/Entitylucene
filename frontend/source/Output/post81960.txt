Is it possible to buy a replacement iPad screen of the same quality as Apple's? <body> I've found a few companies that offer replacement iPad digitizers (the digitizer is the glass/touch screen part of your iPad), but I'm worried that they might be different to the official one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zWIPM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Having broken the glass on my iPad 3 I initially spoke to Apple, but they wanted far too much to repair it ($400!). I then looked into third-party repairs (which were still quite pricey), and then discovered DIY repair kits.  Replacing the glass doesn't seem too difficult, based on the tutorials I've looked at, so my only concern now is the quality of the replacement kits.  Is it possible to buy a repair kit that has parts that are (more or less) identical to Apple's? I wouldn't want to replace the a part with something inferior :(  <answer82027> iFixit is a great resource for repair manuals and the corresponding parts.  It appears they currently (2-13) have iPad digitizers for ~$100.  Personally I only have experience purchasing internal iPhone parts from them, but they are a reputable company and I would trust their quality if I were in your position.  <answer99977> Through my personal experience I recommend you iPad 3 Screen Repair Guide. I like ifixit's stuff, but they always fall short. They just tell you to put it back together the way you took it apart. After successfully following this guide I can tell you that you definitely need to know the special tips to put it back together correctly. “iPad 3 Screen Repair Guide” they have a video as well as a step by step guide. I hope this helps you out!  <comment94513> Where are you buying from? <comment94663> Wow, that's quite a bit more expensive than other Digitizers I've seen -- I guess it's because it's exactly the same as Apple's(?). It might be me just paying a third-party company at that rate. (They have kit with the home button installed and all the adhesives in place, but including shipping to the UK, that's $175!) <comment94723> What is your target price range? <comment95082> I just want to get my iPad back to being as good as new for as cheap as possible.
