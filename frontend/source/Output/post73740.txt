Yes, you should eject it first before you unplug the USB cable to ensure that it isn't in the middle of performing an operation.  If you enable automatic (instead of manual) syncing, I believe there is no need to eject.  You can certainly sync over WiFi without the iPad being plugged in via USB; that is the point of WiFi syncing, after all ;) (You do need the iPad plugged into power, though, I think).
