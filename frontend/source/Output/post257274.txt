iCloud Photo Library is re-uploading photos after soft reset <body> I needed to soft reset my iPhone and I noticed that the iCloud Photo Library is uploading 9k photos that are already stored inside iCloud Photo Library.  How could I make iCloud syncing stuff as opposed to re-uploading it?  My WiFi upload speed is low and 9 thousands photos and videos are just infuriating to wait.  Anybody can help pls
