MacPro (2013) GPU power D300, 500 or 700? <body> Now the dust has settled, and it became sort of clear that the new MP can be strongpartly/strong upgraded (RAM, SSD CPU) (but not the video card), i'm doubting what would be the best strategy (don't want to buy a new MP in 2-3 years).  http://www.macrumors.com/2013/12/27/new-mac-pro-confirmed-to-have-removable-cpu/  Because only the GPU can't be updated, i'm questing what good a D700 will do? Is it only (truly) useful when in the video business? Or would photoshop/aperture have any advantage from this?  <comment136024> So far, the only app which has been demonstrated to have significant performance improvements on the new Mac Pro model is Apple's own Final Cut Pro X.  I'd consider it likely that a new version of Aperture is under development - Adobe will probably need some time to develop, test, and release updates to their apps that also take advantage of the new architecture.  All conjecture, of course. <comment136185> I dont understand why this is put this on hold. I updated the question. Of-course its opinion based, as most things, there is not one correct answer. However some people might  shed some light (specific expertise) on how the GPU is used and if its something we need (when not in a video business). <comment136592> Nice question.

Some people here find it not relevant, but i do think more info on the matter would be welcome!
