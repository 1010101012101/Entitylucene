Does the 12 W adapter charge the Watch faster than the 5 W adapter? <body> As options for power adapters for the Watch, the Apple Store offers both 5 W and 12 W USB power adapters. Is there a difference in how fast these adapters charge the Watch?  <comment219911> @Buscar웃: Any data on how much? <comment219937> @Buscar웃 true for a phone... But do we know that's also watch true?  With the magnetic inductive coupler to connect rather than a direct electrical connection like an iPhone or iPad. <comment219939> @Tyson: Uh oh — Buscar웃 may owe me for the cost of a 12 W charger! <comment219943> @Buscar웃: Wait — you were *guessing*? That's my question (look at it):  do they offer the 5 and the 12 because there's a difference in charging speed? <comment219954> In future, if you don't know what you are talking about, please don't act so confident that you do. <comment219964> I had a feeling.... *sigh*
