How do I make different email accounts use the default sounds again? <body> On an iPhone running iOS 6.0.1, I used Settings &rarr; Notifications &rarr; Mail to set different "new message" sounds for different mail accounts. Now I want to make all mail accounts again follow the default sound set under Settings &rarr; Sounds &rarr; New Mail. How can I do this? When I change the "New Mail" alert sound, the individual mail accounts no longer change.  I have tried manually setting all the mail accounts to use the same sound and vibration setting as the default. However, they still don't change when I change the default setting.  <answer88689> It's not a direct answer, but by deleting an App, you remove the local cached copy of the emails and don't lose any messages on the Mail server.  This has a side effect of clearing the preference for sounds, so when you add the account back - it now follows the default sounds as set in the UI.  <comment92975> does the issue still persists after the 6.1 update? <comment94314> @Macmaniman Yes. There's no UI element I can find that would "follow default settings", so as far as I can tell each mail account is "follow the default settings until I customize it once, then never again". <comment94560> For some dumb reason i cant figure out how to comment so please someone tell me, considering your problem still persists, i recommend, iCloud backup/restore. however, the problem might persist, sense its a "setting" its worth a try! <comment94670> @Macmaniman It's not worth it to me to go through that much trouble. An easier solution would probably be to delete then re-add the mail account. But, I also don't want to bother with that. It's just odd that there doesn't seem to be a setting for this. <comment95418> it is, you are right, but, its really not touble, i think its suuuper easy, however, you are absolutly right its wierd that you cant reset the setting!
