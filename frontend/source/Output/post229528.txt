Google Apps via Apple Mail Not Sending <body> The problem only began within the last couple of weeks (or so I can tell).  I use Google Apps for all of my organizations, of which there are several, and I have them all set up in Apple Mail (as well as on my phone, etc.).  All of a sudden, some percentage of the time, when I send an email through Apple Mail (on OS X), everything appears to work but it does not. The little progress bar at the bottom of the main window pops up and completes, the email appears to have sent and I go on my way.  I've now had a few people tell me they didn't get emails from me that they were expecting (even in spam), and here is the weird part: when I look in my sent folder, they are not there. I've also logged into the Gmail Web App, and they also are not in the sent folder there!  I seem to be receiving just fine, and a majority of the time, the mail I send is delivered.  At first I thought I was crazy, and just remembered wrongâ€”that I hadn't really sent what I thought. But it's happened multiple times now, and I can't figure it out.  I'm on the latest non-beta version of El Capitan and Apple Mail.
