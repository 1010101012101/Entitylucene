Left AirPods in Washing Machine <body> I stupidly left my AirPods in the washing machine through a whole cycle. I took them out, hand dried them, and they were surprisingly still working. I used them for about an hour after that and then all of a sudden they shut off.   Now, they won't turn on at all. I've tried holding down the button for 15 seconds and re-charging them with no luck.  Any ideas for how to fix this problem? Are they permanently dead?  <answer280886> Apple support can quote you a repair. Since they have batteries and several processors inside each, immersion and agitation for tens of minutes likely caused an overload / short circuit which will be followed by rapid corrosion of metal in the device.   <answer280943> h1Bag of rice/h1  Perhaps the bag of dried rice trick as commonly done for iPhones.  Ideally you would have done something like that embefore/em turning them on. May be too late if you fried the circuitry.   <comment353383> @BasilBourque comments are to clarify the post. If you want to answer "bag of rice" please put that in as an answer.
