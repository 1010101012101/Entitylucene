Why do I have to enable 'Developer' for Spotlight to find Numbers documents? <body> In order to get macOS Spotlight to find Numbers documents, I need to enable "Developer" in Spotlight's settings.   Why do I need to do this? I don't want to enable developer searches from Spotlight, so I'm stuck being unable to use Spotlight to find Numbers documents.  hr  (I'm not the only person with this problem.)  <comment321247> Do you/Did you have Xcode installed? <comment321249> @fsb: Yes I do. <comment321250> I've read that your issue is the result of having Xcode and that's how Apple has decided to do it.  I'm not sure it can be changed. <comment321251> @fsb: Can you provide a link. That sounds nuts. It means that in order to find my Numbers docs, I need to see quite a bit of developer hits. (Yet another reason to switch to Google!) <comment321252> I'll have to look again, i closed that tab/browser because I'm shutting down for the night.  Try unchecking 'Developer' from Search Results for Spotlight in Settings.  See if that helps.  No promises, this is from memory :-). <comment321253> @fsb: Thanks. I'm just kind of curious what their rational was if that's the case. (Unchecking Developer looses Numbers sheets.)
