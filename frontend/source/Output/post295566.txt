Is it possible to bind mouse 4 btn to a specific key on the keyboard on MacOS? <body> I bought a cheap USB mouse with 2 additional buttons, the ones that you can click to go back and forward when surfing etc.  strongI'm wondering if it's possible to bind one of those mouse buttons to another key on the keyboard?/strong  Scenario:br I press mouse 4, and it clicks on number 1 on the keyboard.  I'm on MacOS Sierra.  <comment373243> There's a product called ControllerMate that can do this.
