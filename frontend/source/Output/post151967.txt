SSH Public key access - my password is being stored somewhere? <body> I've just created a Public/Private key to access my server via SSH, this has all worked fine but I added a passphrase to the key when it was created.  The first time I logged in via terminal and Cyberduck I was prompted for the passphrase but now I am not.  I chose for my password not to be stored and I can't see anything relating to it in my Keychain Access program.  It must be being stored somewhere, so how to I make sure I am prompted for the passphrase each time?  <comment178873> Mac OS X has `ssh-agent` enabled.
