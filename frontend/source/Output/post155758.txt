Unable to update to xcode6 <body> I had xcode 5.1.1 running on my Mac air. When I tried to update it to Xcode 6, it threw an error "This item is temporarily unavailable. Try again later." I have tried uninstalling the older version, restarting and then installing the new version. Nothing has worked so far.  Any idea how to fix this?  <comment183234> I've been having the same problem. Only Xcode won't download. Everything else updates/downloads correctly. <comment183236> no problem here, click on instal in apple store and it works for me. <comment183335> I got this fixed. On the Dashboard there was a "paused" icon for xcode. Deleted it,restarted and installed xcode6. Worked fine. <comment184852> In Dashboard or LaunchPad and how did you delete it?
