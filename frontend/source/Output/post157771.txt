Attempting to copy a .zip file over SMB results in "Invalid argument" <body> I am on OS X Yosemite. I have connected to my work via VPN. I have mounted a share on the VPN over SMB. I can see the code.zip/code file that I want (I just created it) but I cannot copy it:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeRammy:Main phrogz$ pwd /Volumes/public/foo/bar/Main  Rammy:Main phrogz$ ll *.zip -rwx------  1 phrogz  staff    76M Nov 22 21:47 Lux.zip*  Rammy:Main phrogz$ cp Lux.zip ~/Documents/Work cp: Lux.zip: Invalid argument /code/pre  I can copy some other files from the same directory without issue, but others give me the same problem. I can rename the file from the command line without issue.  Is this an SMB issue? A problem with the file size? A problem with Yosemite?  How can I get this (and other) files copied? I kinda need them.  hr  subIn case it's relevant, the file was created with 7-zip, and the VPN software is Cisco AnyConnect./sub  <comment185520> Have you tried `cp /Volumes/public/foo/bar/Main/Lux.zip ~/Documents/Work` ?
