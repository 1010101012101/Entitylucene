How do I get bash with readline support from Nix? <body> I am experimenting with the Nix package manager on macOS. The codebash/code package I got from Nix doesn’t seem to have readline support enabled:  precode$ nix-env -i bash installing ‘bash-4.3-p46’ building path(s) ‘/nix/store/468xvd20nj86yr6k16g2918849f3w7pn-user-environment’ created 119 symlinks in user environment $ bash Restored session: Thu Nov 24 14:21:31 CET 2016 $ foo^A^K /code/pre  How do I get Bash with readline from Nix?  <answer262876> Are you passing a boolean true to the expression for the 'interactive' attribute? It appears this is required in the expression for the bash package for readline support.   There's also an expression with the boolean already supplied so codenix-env -iA nixpkgs.bashInteractive/code should give bash with readline support enabled.   <comment328750> Have you tried `nix-env -i readline`? <comment328753> Didn’t previously. Did just now, didn’t help. <comment329323> I didn’t know the right syntax to install packages by attributes, this looks like it should work. I have already aborted my Nix experiment (too much hassle right now), but when I return to it later, I will give it a try. Thank you! <comment329867> @zoul: Installing by attribute is definitely the recommended way. There is talk of making it the default way as well, I think.
