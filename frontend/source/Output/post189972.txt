No SMS notifications for one contact <body> I have a weird problem. For this one contact I don't get any sound or vibration notifications when a SMS arrives.  What I have tried:    ul liChange Text Tone/li liChange Vibration/li liDelete contact and create new with same mobile number/li liRebooted iPhone/li /ul  What could be the problem?  <answer189973> You may have accidentally muted the SMS conversation.br To change this go to the SMS messages for that contact and click codeDetails/code (top right) and make sure that codeDo Not Disturb/code isn't selected.
