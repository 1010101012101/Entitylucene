SRT subtitle problem <body> I have the same issue as in [this question][1], but now, there is no Perian to help me out. I have an m4v film that I can play in QT7 and see the subtitles, but not in QTX.  I've tried Subler, Handbrake and Submerge. I've tried QT7 export, and VLC.  I really want to get the film into iTunes. Does anyone know some methods?  UPDATE - thanks to Kerlix. I had to save the art in UTF-8.  precodeThis was the sequence that worked for me:  Handbrake from avi to m4v Subler:   - . remove any existing subtitles  Save and verify  Convert my subtitles to UTF-8 Subler    . new file  . drag in movie  . import my subtitles.  . at first import screen, change Passthrough to Tx3g  . OK  . change default language to your subtitle language  . save  Test in QTX    [1]: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/44406/quicktime-x-cant-use-srt-files /code/pre  <answer114577> you might try Subs Factory or re-saving the SRT in Text Wrangler as UTF-8. Or re-encoding the file with the SRT as soft subs in Handbrake. I've also used MPEGStreamclip and Avidemux for other file formats. Good luck!  <answer143178> You can use Subtitle Writer to save your SRT subtitles to m4v on Mac. If you want to edit or create a SRT subtitles on mac, SRT Edit Pro is a good choice. These 2 app on Mac App Store are made by me. Try it, if you have any concern, email me.  <comment134293> Thank you very much. Saving the SRT in UTF-8 format (I did it in TextMate), solved the problem. I have updated my question with the sequence that worked for me. <comment168644> Thanks for disclosing your relationship with the product. Welcome to Ask Different!
