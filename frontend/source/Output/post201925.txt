iPad 4 Charges Very Slowly <body> After I updated to iOS 8.4, My iPad has been charging emVery/em slowly.  Times:  12:00PM (noon) - iPad died, switched on charger. (1%)  1:30PM - iPad comes on. (2%)  3:00PM - 4%  4.00PM - 9%  5:10PM - 9%  What is wrong here? This is completely not normal. I have also got an iPad mini with the same charger. And charges much faster.  strongCharger:/strong  10W Offical Apple Charger  <answer201948> Sounds like a bad battery, to me. Over time, batteries just wear out to the point of not holding a charge or charging very slowly. An iPad is pretty tough to repair, so unless you have some experience in repairing them, I'd seek a pro to replace the battery for you.  <comment243488> Does it charge faster on other wall outlets or at a friend's house? <comment243497> Sadly no, it does not.
