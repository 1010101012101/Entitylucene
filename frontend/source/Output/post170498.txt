Unclear iCloud Photo Library Feature <body> If I fill up the space on my iPhone with photos, but those photos are synced with iCloud Photo Library, how do I remove those photos from my iPhone without deleting them from iCloud Photo Library. Hence, when I try to delete a photo it says:      This photo will be deleted from iCloud Photo Library on all your   devices.   Seems like I'm stuck?  <answer170500> Since your goal is to free up space, you can configure your iPhone to only store thumbnails of the photos you have in iCloud Photo Library rather than the full-resolution images.  This is configured in strongSettings  iCloud  Photos  Optimize iPhone Storage/strong (as opposed to emDownload and Keep Originals/em)  See this strongiMore article/strong for more information on optimising storage.  It is not currently possible to emcompletely/em remove photos or videos from one device when using iCloud Photo Library. This is clarified in the strongiCloud Photo Library beta FAQ/strong:     Deleting a photo or video from your Photos app will also remove the   item from iCloud Photo Library and from your iCloud storage   allocation.   The solution would be to disable iCloud Photo Library, allowing you to delete certain photos from certain devices, but then new photos would not be synchronised automatically.  <comment200425> I can't tell you for certain right now, but I think it doesn't delete it from your iCloud Photo Library. It only deletes it from your devices. <comment200430> Thank you for your reply. I already have this feature enabled. I have a huge photo library with many videos. Question still remains. <comment200433> @VIPPY To the best of my knowledge there is no way to do this while using iCloud Photo Library. I've updated my answer to reflect this. <comment200435> Thank you Lyes. This is a bummer as I was hoping to include my entire photo library (from my Mac) when the new Photos app becomes available in March. Golden wish: have a complete cloud solution that will allow me to access terabytes of photos/videos/documents from a phone or tablet that has minimal capacity. =) <comment200436> I guess next question is, how optimized are these photos (and do the videos get optimized too). IE: a photo that is normally 3MB is optimized down to 500K. <comment336627> @Spotlight This is wrong. As the message indicates, deleting a photo from the iCloud photo library deletes it everywhere.
