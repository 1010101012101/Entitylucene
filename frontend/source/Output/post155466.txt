Scilab installed but application does not start <body> I have installed Scilab a few weeks ago, and when I tried it for the first time it worked, but now when I try to run it, it seems it will open (it jumps) the application, but nothing happens actually.  What could be the problem and how can I solve it?  <answer155481> I think that the problem is because when I first installed codeScilab/code I hadn't already updated my Mac to the codeYosemite/code version. Therefore I had installed codeScilab/code not for the codeYosemite/code version, but for the previous one.   What made me think this was that in the official website of codeScilab/code it's written that for codeYosemite/code versions, we should install this Scilab 5.5.1 - Mac OS X 10.10 148.82 MB version, and probably I had not installed it.  <answer155492> If you are right about it being OS compatibility then yes installing the latest version which works fine for me on Yosemite should work.  To answer your question about the upgrade: If I remember correctly scilab is a standard Mac install via a .dmg and drag the application to the Applications folder.  If this is the case then just download the latest .dmg from here - http://www.scilab.org/download/5.5.1 (make sure to download the one verified for 10.10), mount it and copy the application to the Applications folder overwriting the previous version. And now it should work. Let  me know if it doesn't.  <comment182913> I have uninstalled the previous one and then installed the new one, and it seems it is working ;) <comment182919> Ok good to hear. ;)
