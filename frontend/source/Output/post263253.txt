Cloud storage options for only partial syncing <body> I've got 800GB of documents and photos on my Google Drive and only 250GB of local storage. Obviously I can't keep it all locally and I wouldn't want to so I've synced some folders but for the folders that haven't been synced I have to either sync the folder first to see it in Finder or check it out from the web, work on it, then upload it.Looking at Dropbox you have to work the same.   I'm surprised that I can't find an offering that just keeps a reference to the files locally and when I try to open it, it downloads it. Does anyone know a product that can do it, specifically on Mac?
