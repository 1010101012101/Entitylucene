How do I stop the play/pause keyboard buttons from launching iTunes on Mountain Lion? <body> The play/pause keyboard buttons always launch iTunes. I want to use a Subsonic client, Thumper. The buttons control Thumper correctly, but I want to prevent iTunes launching.  There was a hacky solution available previously, but that no longer works.  Is there a way to disable this iTunes behaviour?  <answer72094> I searched everywhere for a clean solution. Many solutions that worked for Lion and below no longer worked for Mountain Lion. However, this works and it took me hours to find.

As it turns out, disabling the iTunes launch behavior for these keys is as easy as unloading rcd with the following command:   precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist /code/pre  <answer127835> If you press kbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdpause/kbd it doesn't open iTunes. Also it sometimes works if you only press kbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdpause/kbd or kbdshift/kbd + kbdpause/kbd  <comment149776> This doesn't sound like an answer to me, is it an answer? If so, please be more certain and edit your answer. <comment160393> Doing the unloading tip above disabled my headphone volume up/down buttons. Be wary!
