What's a good iTunes alternative to use with my iPod nano 6g? <body> I'm looking for an iTunes alternative for my new iPod nano 6g.  I've used sharepod before but it doesn't work with the nano 6gâ€”I can upload songs but they're not being recognized by the iPod database.  Any ideas on alternatives that work with the nano 6g?  <answer6159> If you're using Windows, try DoubleTwist. (Not sure if it supports Apple products on OSX yet.)  <answer6167> Mediamonkey is a good alternative on Windows, the nano 6th gen is present in the list of compatible devices.  <comment6442> looks like it works only for android devices? <comment8949> Even though the list on media monkey says it works, if you dig deeper it works for 6G classic and up to 5G Nano.  No 6G nano.  sucks.
