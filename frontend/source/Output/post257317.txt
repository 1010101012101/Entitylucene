How to get macOS Sierra to stop asking me to enable Siri <body> macOS Sierra is constantly displaying an "Enable Siri?" dialog. If I pick cancel it just pops up again 5 seconds later.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBR7z.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I tell macOS Sierra to stop asking?  <answer257328> Accept by clicking strongEnable Siri/strong, then go into strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongSiri/strong to emuncheck/em strongEnable Siri/strong. That should take care of it.  <answer283035> If you've been mistakenly triggering the Siri pop-up when your finger mistakenly hits the top right area on the Control Strip, you can remove the Siri icon.  Go to:  → System Preferences → Keyboard, then click the "Customize Control Strip" button on the bottom.   Move your cursor to the Control Strip (which will now be in Edit Mode), and click and Drag the Siri Icon back onto your screen into the area with all the unused Control Strip widgets.   <answer283048> Ok, Anton found out how to do the whole procedure by himself, thanks to @blueberryfields and @bret7600.  strongMy thoughts: It may be easier to boot a mac of an external hard drive instead of messing with nano.  It depends how okay you are with the Terminal./strong  First of all you need to disable System Integrity Check to be able to edit codecom.apple.Siri.plist/code file.  ol liReboot in Recovery mode by restarting your Mac and holding kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd. It can take more time to boot as usual, that's OK, just be patient./li liIn top menu go to strongUtilities/strong and open Terminal./li liType codecsrutil disable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd/li liType codereboot/code and press kbdEnter/kbd to reboot again./li /ol  Now you should edit codecom.apple.Siri.plist/code file.  ol liOpen Terminal.app/li liType codesudo nano /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Siri.plist/code to open the file in nano editor with root privileges./li liFind the following lines code &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt; &lt;false/&gt; /code and change them to code &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/li liPress kbdControl/kbd+kbdX/kbd then kbdy/kbd and then kbdEnter/kbd to save the file and exit nano./li /ol  Now you should enable System Integrity Check back. It is there for a reason.  ol liReboot in Recovery mode by restarting your Mac and holding kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd  ol start="2" liIn top menu go to strongUtilities  Terminal/strong/li liType codecsrutil enable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd/li liType codereboot/code and press kbdEnter/kbd to reboot again./li /ol/li /ol  Now if you check Activity Monitor - you should see no traces of Siri there. You can repeat this procedure with code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.assistantd.plist/code to disable it either.  <comment321269> Have you tried enabling it, then going into **System Preferences** and turning it off? <comment321283> that seems to have done it .. crossing my fingers <comment325622> Please ask a new question for the earpod problem as the answer may likely be different and it is kind of confusing of having both topics mingled into one. <comment325623> Or check https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/252259/prevent-earpod-play-pause-button-from-activating-siri-on-macos-sierra first which seems to cover that already. <comment326305> This does NOT end it.  Pressing the Mic button accidentally, will trigger the whole cycle over again. <comment355134> THIS DOES NOT WORK <comment356805> This is almost a duplicate https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/258816/how-to-completely-disable-siri-on-sierra
