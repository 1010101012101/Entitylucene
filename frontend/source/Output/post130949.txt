Is there any default tool in OSX by which to add text (such as subtitle) to a video? <body> I would like to add a notification to a video at some particular time period that "Mistake  Lorem in this".  strongDoes OSX have any default video tool (simple) to add any type of text (subtitle ok too) to the video?/strong  <answer130956> It isn't built-in to OS X, but perhaps this $9 tool might be what you're looking for.  Just looking for subtitles? Then look no further than Aegisub  If you need something free, built-in to OS X (and you have programing chops), perhaps OS X's Core Video and Automator are worth a look too.  Or can you be more specific?  <answer130999> iMovie may work for you.  Import your Movie and then.  1,  Select the Titles in the Content library to pick Title theme  2, Drag the Subtitle Theme down to the movie strip.  3, Adjust the Subtitle time line to where you want it and duration.  4, Write you text in the text field.  5, Set your text style.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dpdHG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Open image  hr  <answer131002> Another one that isn't built into OSX but Subler is an excellent, small, and free program for adding .srt files to existing video (in multiple codecs).   <answer139202> Originally, I did not mean to have subtitles but change mistakes and correct them.  My friend says the best tool here is strongPremier/strong (Adobe).  He says that iMovie is difficult to use.  <answer143180> If your video is in mp4 format, you can embed SRT subtitles to video using Subler. It's a free software.  If your video is not in mp4 format, you should go to Subtitle Writer on Mac App Store. It's an paid app for $4.99.  Both Subler and Subtitle Writer are making subtitle track in video so that Quicktime Player X or iOS devices can show them as Closed Caption.  If you just want to make few comments on video, you can make it in iMovie.  <comment153685> Have you attempted to do this with iMovie?  Technically it's not part of OS X but it IS included with all Macs, at least for the last 9 years or so.  Before that it was bundled with Macs or free to download.
