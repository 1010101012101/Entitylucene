Transform old iphone entry into new one for docking station <body> I have a docking station that works that plays music by connecting an (old) iPhone 3. Since I don't want do throw away a working music station, I was wondering if there exist a cable that would allow me to connect instead my new iPhone 5 to it.  <answer226139> This Lightning to 30-pin adapter from Apple should work just fine.
