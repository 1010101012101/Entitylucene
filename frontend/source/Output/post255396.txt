Memorize Window Locations in Spaces (Mission Control)? <body> Is there an app out there that will let you memorize window locations over different desktops in mission control?  Not just remember them when I restart, but save the locations of all open windows as different configurations that can be reloaded when needed.  I've looked everywhere.  Cheers  <comment318069> It does that itself, so long as you don't have any single app spread over more than one Space. Could you edit your question to clarify exactly what is[n't] happening, & what you expect to happen. <comment318659> Thanks, I updated the question to be more clear.
