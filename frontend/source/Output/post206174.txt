How do I tell iTunes to NOT mark podcasts as "Skip when shuffling" by default? <body> I have a Smart Playlist that selects a set of music and podcasts for me to listen to throughout the day. However, iTunes decides it's a good idea to check the strong"Skip when shuffling"/strong checkbox for all podcasts the moment it downloads them:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KI2yH.png" alt="The Nerdist podcast, with &quot;Skip when shuffling&quot; checked."  My current workaround is unchecking these manually for each podcast, and does indeed include them when playing the playlist, but this is obviously not a permanent fix. strongIs there any way to tell iTunes that is's OK to play podcasts when shuffling by default?/strong  <comment249275> Possibly related to an older Apple discussion, [_Smart playlist of "Media Kind is Podcast" not syncing to iPad_](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3080182?start=0&tstart=0) <comment249497> [Cross-posted to Apple Support Communities](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7230534)
