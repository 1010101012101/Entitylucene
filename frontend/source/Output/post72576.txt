How can I create a new Recovery Partition on EXTERNAL disk? <body> I want to enable encryption on an strongexternal/strong emFireWire/em disk. The disk has been formatted a while ago (2+ years), and when choosing "encrypt volume" from the Finder context menu, Mountain Lion refuses with the message:      A Recovery system for the targeted disk is required   Turns out: You need a Recovery Partition (RP) on the external disk you want to encrypt. Mine does not have one, as it was formatted when there were no Recovery Partitions.   Reformatting the drive does create a new RP, but I can’t do this because I have no spare disks where I can swap the data to.  This hint is not useful, as it deals with internal disks.  So I am looking for a way to strongcreate a Recovery Partition/strong on the emexternal/em disk so that I can strongenable encryption/strong for this disk. (How) can this be done?   EDIT: Yes, there is space on the disk for another partition. codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME           SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme               *320.1 GB   disk2    1:                        EFI                209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS le_disk        306.7 GB   disk2s2 /code/pre  EDIT II:  Output from an other disk. Here, encryption of a partition (FreeSpace-500) emhas/em worked directly from Finder.

It would appear that this Apple Knowledge Base article does, in fact, answer your question: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4848  You would need to create a new partition on the external disk (which the article implies, but does not state, can be done non-destructively, suggesting that the partition does not need to be physically before the start of the data partition).  As long as you have space to create a new 1GB partition on the external disk, the article seems to suggest you can install a recovery disk to that partition.  That said, and this is an issue, before repartitioning or encrypting a disk with valuable data, it would be a strongvery/strong  strongvery/strong good idea to back up said data in case something goes wrong.  <answer73163> It's actually possible to non-destructively add a recovery partition to a disk using Carbon Copy Cloner. From the Window menu select Disk Center and select the disk you want to add a recovery partition to from the list on the left hand side. The tab Recovery Partition on the right hand side should allow you to add the recovery partition.    As already suggested, be sure to have a backup when live repartitioning disks just in case something goes wrong.  <answer73257> h1Manually Cloning a Recovery Partition/h1  This process worked for me on an external USB drive, but I don't have a Firewire drive or encrypted partition to test with, but it should work for you.  h3Requirements/h3  ul liExisting recovery partition on your internal drive (or elsewhere)./li liAt least 650 MB of free space on your external drive (a previous version of this answer required more space, but I fixed the first section to only use what's required)./li /ul  h2Add New Partition/h2  emNotes: this process is not destructive, provided you have sufficient free space on your drive./em  ol liIn Terminal, run codediskutil list/code.

It depends on whether the recovery partition *has* to be *physically* before the data partition or not. <comment84931> I don't know if the RP has to be physically before the data partition or not. <comment84935> What does `diskutil list` show for the external? Can you create a new 1 GB partition by shrinking existing or allow one existing partition to serve as e recovery HD. it needs to be about 700 MB of space. <comment84989> Recovery Disk Assistant does work on USB devices. Unfortunately, mine is a FireWire disk. <comment85145> 650 MB, to be exact. <comment85151> Thank you very much for this extensive trip to the Terminal (like!). I followed the steps, but got `Error: -69742: The requested change in size is too small` after Step 3. <comment85152> Interesting! I did not know CCC had this functionality. I tried, and on the surface it worked. After setting up encryption however, the process stopped with this dialog: ["Boot file not written"](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/63472/26522). Any ideas? <comment85172> I got that once, double check you're using the right value for the resized volume. It should be the number from step 2 *minus 650002432*. If that still doesn't work, try decreasing that value, or resizing the partition from Disk Utility, then follow the steps in the second section. <comment85388> @myhd any luck? If you're still having trouble, let me know and I can offer some further assistance. <comment85760> I have tried with decreasing the partition from Disk Utility, and nothing has helped. Tried the same thing from a disk that had the same characteristics described in the original question, and all went well, even without having to resort to your tips. Mysterious. I do assume now the first disk in question was hosed somehow. I found a interesting bit, however: The newly-created partition on the to-be-encrypted disk is called "Boot OS X" instead of "Recovery HD" on the built-in system disk. Maybe that’s why it did not work in the first place? <comment85783> Ah, I see why you're running into problems. Based on the `diskutil list` that you added to your post, you don't have a recovery partition. You'll want to [add one](http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57366205-263/how-to-restore-a-missing-recovery-hd-partition-in-lion/) before proceeding. <comment85904> Yes, the recovery partition is on disk1, which I omitted from the post. <comment85918> Ah okay, was hard to tell from what you posted. Is journalling enabled on the volume you can't resize? <comment330842> I tried this in OS X 10.8.5 on `asr` v278 with `restore` and `restoreexact` and also Recovery Disk Assistant 1.0 — no dice: when I select the disk at startup it jumps right away to the bootdisk login prompt. Any ideas?
