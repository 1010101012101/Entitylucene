Installing windows 7 on Imac <body> I have a mid-2010 27" iMac with macOS 10.12.5 and an external DVD - USB SuperDrive (the internal DVD drive is broken).    I can't install Windows 7 from DVD with Bootcamp. After downloading support software to USB flash drive via BootCamp Assistant, I get an error on restart:     No bootable device -- Insert boot disk and press any key.   What can I do?   <answer285645> You need to convert it to an ISO.  Apple's official guide  <answer285648> After days and days of searches and failed attempts I managed to install windows7 with the technique described by this boy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pSFUMdzWaA&amp;ab_channel=YassineIBNELHASSAN  <comment360321> First of all, welcome to Ask Different! :) Secondly, thank you for sharing the solution you found to your question.
