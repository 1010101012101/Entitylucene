Using Touch ID with Amazon App <body> According to the update in the App Store, the Amazon app now supports login via Touch ID. Has anyone figured out how to use it?  <answer145869> The application keeps you logged in to your account once you log in unless you log out, but if you do anything that would require a password entry like managing your wish list, a Touch ID prompt comes up giving you the option to use your fingerprint instead of typing in your password   <answer148037> I just received this email from Amazon that refutes the existence of the feature:     Hello,       Thank you for contacting Amazon.  I've researched "Touch ID" feature   and found this feature it isn't available with the Amazon Appstore   apps at this time. We're constantly adding apps and features to our   selection, and features not unavailable now may become available in   the future.       I've forwarded your message to our Appstore development team for   consideration.       We look forward to seeing you again soon.      Best regards,   Devender K   <answer155036> You're not alone, no one knows how to turn it on (or off!)  Amazon app for iPhone adds Touch ID support, but nobody knows how to turn it onâ€¦or off  A friend of mine says it works on his iPhone 6+.  And so, I log into the same Amazon app on my iPhone 6, via name and password, I order products, manage my wish list, and emnever/em see the TouchID interface appear. So strange!  <answer156192> Go to settings, scroll down till you find a list of downloaded apps. Locate and tap Amazon app. You will find toggle switch to turn on/off touch id feature. Good Luck.  <comment174522> Umm. The Amazon Appstore is their Android app store that competes with Google Play, and has no bearing on iOS. <comment174548> I thought the letter was worded funny. It seems they are more confused about the feature than we are! <comment277442> Note (2016-02-15): I just used the app, went to check out, and was prompted for *both* Touch ID and my password. Seems rather useless to me.
