How to restart USB subsystem? <body> I'm developing onto Arduino and sometimes the USB port that is being used stops working. Then I need to plug the device into another USB port. Once all the USB ports stop working I have to restart the machine which is really annoying. As far as I remember there is a command which is able to restart the USB subsystem individually but I can't remember. How to restart USBs without restarting the entire system? Thanks.  I'm using Mac OS X Sierra.  <comment373815> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question doesn't appear to be about Apple hardware, software, or services as defined in the [Help Center](https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) <comment373887> This is Mac OS X software related. <comment373893> From the way your question is worded, it is completely unclear how this is OS X related.  You need to include the Mac model, the version of the OS you are running, etc.  Remember, we are not there to look over your shoulder. <comment373902> The tag `sierra` was added. I've just updated the question too. <comment373903> What model(s) of Mac are you using? <comment373905> Why is this not Mac related? It's about USB ports on his Mac, and how to restart the USB system on the Mac, not on Arduino. On the other hand, the Ardiono community might be more helpfull as they will see this problem more often. https://arduino.stackexchange.com/ <comment373918> From my comment that starts off *"From the way your question is worded..."* tells why it appears this isn't Mac related.  You need to articulate what your issue is, what you expect the result to be and what your environment is.  Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder.  Also, this question recently answered addresses your question    https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/294944/resetting-the-usb-port-on-a-macbook-pro/295187#295187  so now your question (based on the comments) is potentially a dupe.
