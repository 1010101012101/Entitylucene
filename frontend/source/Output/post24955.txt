Internet Sharing failing on Mac OS X Lion Server <body> Before I upgraded to Lion Server, I was running 10.7.1  I setup Internet Sharing in the preferences  (Share from Ethernet 1 to Ethernet 2).  After the upgrade, sharing doesn't work unless I take the following steps  ol liLogin/li liTurn off Internet Sharing/li liTurn Internet Sharing back on/li /ol  So the question is can I have Internet Sharing on and running even if no one is logged in?  Thanks  <answer44681> http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1228469  is my Forum post. You can't get credit for copy/pasting my own post back to me.  <answer49647> The answer is yes.  I'm typing you this answer through an codeInternetSharing/code connexion provided by an iMac running MacOS Lion (10.7.3) where no one is connected:  precodeme -&gt; MBP    ………Wi-Fi………   iMac   ………Ethernet………   Internet        10.6.8               10.7.3 /code/pre  I'm using such a connection for professionnal use since MacOS 10.4 with no one connected (on the Mac running codeInternetSharing/code). This connection was used by 5 other Mac (10.4, 10.5, 10.6) and might be considered as a nearly professional grade network.  When you login when your codeInternetSharing/code is faulty, could you type in a codeTerminal/code or codexterm/code window:  precodeifconfig -a ps ax | egrep '(bootp|natp)' /code/pre  My first blind guess is that your main Ethernet connection was shut down under the responsability of your codeEnergy Saver/code tuning.  <comment28649> I don't think you can. I don't think you could even before Lion. <comment29598> Previous versions of Mac OS X did this with no problems. 10.7 has this issue. <comment50762> copy paste from http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1228469 asked Sep 13, 2011, 05:12 PM
