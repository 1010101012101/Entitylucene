Unusually long boot time in non-verbose mode - early 2008 MBP + SSD + Mavericks <body> Inside my early 2008 MBP (15", C2D 2.4, 4GB, GF8600M) I installed a used Samsung SSD (128GB), did a clean Mavericks install and at first startup, I restored the Applications, Desktop, Documents etc. from my Time Machine - it went fine. But now it boots up for 5 minutes, even though it used to take like 2-3 mins maximum when the original 200GB HDD with Mountain Lion was inside.   So I mirrored that new Mavericks SSD to the old HDD and booted the machine from it - time varies a lot. I tried different methods - a plain shutdown + start, a restart; I also switched disks couple of times - cannot see any relation to the boot time. In a series of bootups I measured times.  Booting from pressing the button to the login screen usually takes now (+-2 seconds):  ul lifrom SSD 5:07 - that happened ten times. /li lifrom SSD it ONCE booted in 0:24 (+0:20 after logging in),  /li lifrom HDD 0:49, 6:04, 5:35, 1:48, 5:44, 4:29, 5:45 (plus 0:40 to 1:10 after logging in) - this seemingly varies./li /ul  The bottom line is: booting from SSD usually takes exactly 5:07, though it once was 0:24. Booting time from HDD is unpredictable to me. On SSD, after logging in, it takes another 0:20 for all the apps in the background to start etc.; it's 0:40-1:10 on HDD for that - might not matter, but shows that SSD is is fact quicker once the system started.  Console application shows logs like this:  ul li15/11/13 16:54:28,000 bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1384494868 0 /li li15/11/13 16:59:21,000 syslogd[19]: Configuration Notice: ASL Modulebr "com.apple.appstore" claims selected messages. Those messages may not appear in standard system log files or in the ASL database./li /ul  so with every restart, there's boot time logged and the next message is 5 mins later (while using SSD).  Any hints on what to do next? What log to check? What can cause such long start?  strongUPDATE/strong: When I run it in verbose mode, it always boots in 20s from SSD. It's 5:07 again when I don't hold cmd+v during startup. Fcsk tool says disk's fine. Any ideas?  <answer111037> Start in verbose mode and see what takes time. Here is how:  ol liShut down your Mac if it is on./li liPress the power button to start the computer./li liImmediately press and hold the Command key and one of the following: ... the "v" key for verbose mode.  (Command-V) You have successfully entered single-user or verbose mode when you see white text appear on the screen./li /ol  If it is "fsck", than you should start backing up your data â€“ disk is most likely is failing.  <answer244518> ol liTake a look at the OS X Activity Monitor (it's in Applications/Utilities)/li /ol  Do you see a process called installer?  ol start="2" liGo to  /Library/LaunchAgents/ Do you see file names like?/li /ol  com.genieo.completer.update.plist or  /Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieo.engine.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.client.plist  3) If so, you've installed the Genio spyware/fraud root kit.  <comment130761> Thx. Looks like booting up in verbose mode takes ~0:20. At some point during startup it mentions fcsk, but with no drama I guess. I run that tool anyway in single user mode - after couple of seconds it gave me "The volume SSD appears to be OK." The next regular reboot took 5:07. The next reboot in verbose mode - ~0:20 again. Any point in further search for the disk's glitches? Any tools, ideas? <comment131032> 1. Is there any other place where it wais? Sometimes "Waiting for DSMOS" takes time. 2. Try reparing permissions. 3. Try installing AppleJack and check your preferences/clear caches, etc. <comment151421> I'm having a very similar issue. Boot often takes 5-6 minutes with Mavericks running on the latest 15 inch MBP with 1 TB SSD from Apple (no third party hardware at all.) <comment169713> I run my 17" MBP on stripe RAIDed SSDs, non-apple parts. I boot in about 9-12 seconds it seems. I'm unsure about your problem but I'd start by asking if your have TRIM enabled? I wonder if your SSD's in bad shape or if your OS image is just goofed up. I'm also no longer booting Mavericks, but rather Yosemite. <comment241411> Have you selected the drive on System Preferences  Startup Disk? Something in Mavericks makes this setting not choosing the only automatically.
