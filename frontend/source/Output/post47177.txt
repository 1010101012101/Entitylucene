How can I activate the 'say' command from the keyboard? <body> I love the 'say' command in OS X. It's quite possibly the most fun little part of the Mac that I've seen in a while.  However, having to go to Terminal every time I want to use it is a bit of a drag. I'd like to make it a keyboard shortcut.  So: How can I tell OS X to 'say' whatever text I have selected with a keyboard shortcut?  <answer47182> Go to System Preferences, click the "Speech" icon, then click the "Text to Speech" tab. Then simply check the "Speak selected text when the key is pressed" box.  Text you have selected will be spoken when you press the selected key combination.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vNUQa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment54051> You win, I'm deleting my answer :) <comment54052> @jtbandes lol, thanks :)
