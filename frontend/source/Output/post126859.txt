iTunes library on usb drive connected to NAS not recognized anymore <body> I have my iTunes library on an external usb drive. I have no problem accessing it when it is plugged directly to my mac.  I've recently bought a NAS device which allows me to connect a usb drive to it and then access it as if it is a share on the NAS.  I would like to keep my library on the usb drive and be able to access it from the nas, when it is connected to it, and locally, when I plug the drive directly to my mac, without duplicating my strong.itl/strong-file.  When I try to access the tracks from the NAS I get a not found error, although the path of the files looks exactly the same as if the drive were locally connected (same name of the drive, same path from code/Volumes/Drive_Name//code) I'm quite sure my mac believes that the 2 drives are distinct drive with the same name, am I right?  Is there a workaround to achieve what I want to? Either a way to let my mac understand the two volumes are the same or moving the strong.itl/strong-file in the drive and set relative paths to tracks?
