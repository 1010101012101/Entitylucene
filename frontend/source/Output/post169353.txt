Driver issues Windows 8.1 Pro on Late 2011 MBP <body> I installed Windows 8.1 pro on my late 2011 mbp and now I'm having issues with audio and display drivers. I can't get the audio to work at all. I have tried updating the drivers and reinstalling them, but nothing has worked.I am also having trouble with my display driver because I can't project to an external monitor. I have also tried updating drivers and reinstalling, but nothing has helped. I don't really know what to do now, but open to any suggestions on how to solve this.   <answer169460> Technically speaking this might be best asked on a Windows board but...  How did you update and reinstall the drivers?  I would download the latest BootCamp drivers and then go into device manager, find the devices in question and right-click on them and select uninstall.

Windows will likely detect the missing drivers and reinstall them from it's cache. If it doesn't use the drivers you downloaded from Apple
