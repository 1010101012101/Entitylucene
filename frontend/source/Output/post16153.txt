How to install Windows 7 on Mac mini server? <body> Previously I installed Windows 7 on a Macbook Air without problems using Boot Camp Assistant and the excellent directions here.  Now I am trying to install Windows 7 on a Mac mini server and I encounter error with every approach I take. I already have a bootable USB disk with Windows 7 installer.  First I tried to install Windows 7 directly booting the installer. Installer refused to continue displaying an error mentioning something about GPT drive.  Second I tried to install using Boot Camp, but it does not exist on Mac mini servers!  So I copied the Boot Camp Assistant app from Macbook Air, and selected the option "Download the Windows Support software for this mac". It was not able to find and download anything.  I thought I could handle the driver issues later, I used Boot Camp Assistant to make the 500 GB harddisk Windows installable. Then I booted into the installer, selected BOOTCAMP partition and formatted it. Installer did not continue displaying 0x80300024        error.  I run out of ideas and am rather frustrated. Are there any simple instructions on how to install Windows 7 on Mac mini server? Or how can I solve my problem and install?  <answer16157> Boot Camp requires a $29 Snow Leopard OS X DVD (strongemnot the server DVD/em/strong) and an external drive. The MacBook Air SuperDrive works excellently with no driver hassle.  Sorry I don't have a list of drivers and steps to make up for the work done on the OS X since I'm a wimp and will pay good money to save an hour or two my time. Apple only bundles the Windows Drivers for it's hardware with the client version of OS X (AFAIK)  I hope if someone else has done the hard work, they post their experience. The official Apple solution is simple and works well.  <answer198683> finally I did it. all I did I run win7 installation by using DVD player not by USB. All you need is a Boot Camp, Apple's DVD player and Win7 DVD.  I did it after 6 months of trying by googling.  <answer199089> I was able to figure it out.  First I tried installing Windows 7 via USB thumb drive however that didn't work. So I purchased an Apple USB SuperDrive and used my Window 7 Home Premium DVD and Boot Camp Assistant to accomplish the task.  <comment17659> I am asking how to install Windows on mac mini server not MBA. <comment17660> The drive was initially released and named for the Air - which was the first mac without an optical drive. The Mini Server is the second and also uses that drive to let bootcamp work. <comment27447> i'm trying to do this with the lion version of mac mini server. i am having issues i also get the error message person stated above me. If someone can help, i called apple care and the guy on the phone said that the mac mini ships with OS lion and OS lion Server, i'm a bit confused. Any input is much appreciated. <comment237866> Could you please expand on your solution? <comment238453> I bought a DVD player from apple and I already have a original Window 7 home premium. Then I start the boot camp after I formatted the 2nd hard disk (which you already have in server Mac MINI). Then I completed the installation. that's it. <comment238454> Great, would you please add it to your answer? Comments can get deleted. Thanks! <comment238455> I will do it soon
