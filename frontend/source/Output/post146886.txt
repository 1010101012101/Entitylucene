Mac Book Pro Mac OS 10.9.4 <body> I downloaded and installed Microsoft Office. It works fine in my account, but I can't see/access it from other accounts on my computer.  What need I do?  <comment173091> The Microsoft Office 2011 folder should be in the /Applications folder on the hard drive. You may have installed it in the /Users/your_username/Applications folder by mistake and that's why nobody other users can see/access it.
