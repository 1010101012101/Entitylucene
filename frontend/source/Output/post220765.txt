Why is the "Encrypted" format not available in the list when erasing a USB flash chip in Disk Utility? <body> It shows up for normal, external hard disk drives. Is there a way I can force it to encrypt?  The installed OS X is El Capitan.  <answer221367> You can't do it from Disk Utility but you can do it from Finder by right-clicking on the partition and choosing Encrypt.  ol liOpen Disk Utility and click on the drive (not the partition)/li liClick Erase button/li liChoose Name/li liChoose Format: OS X Extended (Journaled)/li liChoose Scheme: GUID Partition Map/li liClick Erase button/li liWhen complete, open Finder/li liRight-click on the new drive partition/li liSelect Encrypt/li liEnter passwords/li liFinish/li /ol  <comment267259> I'm not sure why it doesn't offer before format [but it doesn't, you're right], however, you can encrypt it at any time afterwards - this answer gives a good explanation - http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/181105/85275 <comment268003> Thank-you. I turned your comment in to a simple answer below. <comment312762> The key step here is "click on the drive (not the partition)".  (by the way, I did it from Disk Utility.) <comment357400> For me, after step 10 I get "A partition, not a whole disk, is required for this operation." Could not find any way to create a partition -- the Partition button is greyed out. I also tried Erasing to select the encrypted format -- but that option does not appear
