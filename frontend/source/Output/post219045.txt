iPhone unresponsive every time I try to delete an app <body> Every time I try to delete an app, let's say tap on the "x" sign on the shaking apps, my phone does not show the "confirm delete" option box. Instead, the apps just keep shaking and my phone becomes unresponsive. The home and sleep buttons don't work. If I don't do a hard reset, it just crashes and resets itself. Only way to delete them without the hassle is by deleting them through the storage in settings.  Is there a solution to this, or if there is something that might be causing this?  <comment264961> Sounds like time to do a Restore <comment264964> Gotta agree with @Tetsujin here...   if the OS is running that poorly, I'd recommend doing a backup (iCloud or via iTunes), doing a full reset of the phone, and then restoring from backup.
