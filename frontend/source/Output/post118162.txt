Bluetooth audio streaming from Android to Mac <body> Is there any way I can Stream Audio from my Android device via Bluetooth to my Macbook Pro?   I'm using OS X 10.9.1 and Android 4.4.2.  The AUX-Port on my Android device has stopped working. Is there a way to stream audio to my Mac so that I can play audio on my Android device through my Mac's speakers?  <comment137904> What Android device are you talking about, what version? What version of Mac OS X are you running? I'm missing some details here. <comment137960> @Robuust Mac Version 10.9.1 , Andriod Version - 4.4.2 <comment137973> I'm not sure if it's possible to stream Bluetooth audio **to** a Mac, but, _I could be wrong_. I use the [JBL Flip](http://reviews.cnet.com/bluetooth-speakers/jbl-flip-black/4505-34810_7-35550919.html) bluetooth speakers and I think they're amazing for the size and convenience and decently priced.
