Google Map directions on iPad <body> When looking for directions, Google Maps says "first of three suggested routes."  It shows the first, but I can find no way of finding out what the strongother/strong two suggested routes are.  I've searched the screen and can see no way.  How do I do it?  <answer56714> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ula9J.jpg" alt="iPhone Maps.app Screenshot"  Yes, I know this isn't an iPad screenshot, but I don't currently have iOS 5 on my iPad :). Regardless, the function is the same, you can tap the route labels in order to view the alternative routes. You may need to zoom in or out to see them.  <comment65114> This question _may_ be a better fit at [apple.se].
