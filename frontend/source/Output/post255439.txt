How to write Javascript snippets in Safari developer tools <body> I have been trying out the developer tools on Safari, and found that the "snippets" feature (or equivalent) from Chrome is missing. This feature in Chrome lets you test out custom, short JS scripts, it is present at Dev Tools  Sources  Snippets.   More information on this feature is available at the Google Developers page.  My question - how do I do this in Safari?  There seems to be a feature called "Snippet Builder", but that only runs HTML and CSS. From the Apple Developers page -      Snippet Editor      Snippet Editor provides an interactive sandbox for previewing HTML and CSS, as shown in Figure A-2.
