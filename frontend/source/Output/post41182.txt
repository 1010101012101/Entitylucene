Can anyone help me ?  <answer41509> Applist is a small code library that allows jailbreak app developers to get limited information about the apps that you have installed. Ryan Petrich is a reputable developer, and many popular jailbreak apps use this library. To name a couple, Activator and SBSettings use it. All jailbreak apps have access to everything on your device, so if you're worried about privacy, I'd suggest restoring your device to factory settings. Applist is a dependency to these apps, so if you uninstall it, it'll uninstall them, too. Applist is harmless, so just keep it.  <comment46647> Can you add a little more information?
