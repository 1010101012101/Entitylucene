Why am I getting "Error -1,752" when trying to save in Script Editor? <body> I'm trying to edit a script in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Mail. When I attempt to save from Script Editor I get strongThe document "Reply.scpt" could not be saved. (Error -1,752)/strong. It doesn't seem to be a permissions issue because I can edit and save the file in BBEdit (it's a plain text file).  I'm running Script Editor 2.8.1 under OS X 10.11.1 on a late 2015 iMac.  <answer215489> The problem is that the file is a plain text file. When I originally created the file in 2007, Script Editor could apparently save uncompiled code.scpt/code files. Now, however, as described  in Can&#39;t save AppleScript file when created by touch, code.scpt/code files must be compiled. Uncompiled files can be saved with the code.applescript/code extension.  I know this is nearly a duplicate of the question linked above, but I added it because as of OS X 10.11 El Capitan Script Editor gives an error number for this problem. I couldn't find any other references to this error number so I thought it was worthwhile to get the error number in a question title.
