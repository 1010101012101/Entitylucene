How do I force iCal to sync? <body> I've recently set up my Google Calendars to hook into iCal on OS X Lion.  I've noticed though that when I make a change in iCal, it doesn't sync instantly to Google Calendar.    I'm sure that iCal will eventually sync when it gets a chance, but because I don't leave iCal open all day, I'd like the ability to force it to sync before I shut down.    Is this possible?   <answer30996> As far as I am aware, invoking iCal's "refresh" function, under the Calendar menu should do all server side communication and updates.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHUE9.png" alt="iCal&#39;s Calendar Menu Options"  Refresh will only update the calendar that hosts the event you currently have (or last had) selected. Refresh All will of course update all of your calendars. This should be a two-way process, and not just pulling down new changes, it should also send local changes back assuming it's not being done automatically.  <comment35587> I use BusySync which allows you to manually sync with one click. Quite a good app. <comment35588> Could you tell us how you have your calendar set up? Chiefly, information from iCal Preferences - Accounts <comment35675> I've been using Command R for this for years with MobileMe and its still working fine with iCloud. <comment36201> Ahhh of course, I could have sworn I went through all the menus but obviously not!  Thanks!
