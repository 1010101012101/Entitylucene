Can iPhone produce a ringtone sound in vibrate on silent and Do Not Disturb modes, or automatically switch on sounds when in Do Not Disturb? <body> Is there any way for the iPhone to produce a ringtone sound even if it is set to silent mode with "vibrate on silent" Sounds setting, particularly while also in Do Not Disturb mode?  Here is a more thorough description of my problem/use case:  I like to keep my iPhone on "silent" or "vibrate" mode essentially all day (with rare, brief exceptions for playing music/video aloud), particularly at work so as not to bother others. During the day I have the phone in my pocket so vibration is fine for me to respond to calls/texts.   However, at night, I typically put the phone down for charging, and take the phone off my person. Vibrate doesn't wake me up (perhaps this because I put the phone on a soft surface, but I think even on a hard surface it is less loud and less likely to wake me up than a ringtone), which is fine, except for the possibility of emergency calls. I would still like to be able to receive such potential calls.  One way to do this is press the switch on the (4s) iPhone to turn sounds back on when I put the phone down at night and have Do Not Disturb only let Repeated Calls or calls from Favorites through. However, I would prefer not to have to switch the phone out of vibrate mode when I put it down at night and switch the phone back into vibrate mode every morning, as it seems likely I will forget to do that (and might either miss an important call or disturb coworkers).  So my question is like this question: Is it possible to automatically turn vibrate mode off at night?, except I don't just want to automatically turn off vibrate, but also automatically turn on sounds/ringtones. That user seems to be woken up by vibrate mode unlike me, hence my question.
