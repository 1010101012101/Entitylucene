Can't boot into MacOS X and Boot Camp <body> This happen when I got home from school.  Early morning at school, I still perfectly use Windows in Macbook Pro (early 2011). So I did a hibernation before packing it up. Then when I was gonna use it at home, I wasn't able to boot back to Windows and saying "No bootable device -- Insert Boot Disk and Press any Key". I know that this was cause of no HDD was detected or there is no OS installed.  Now when I try to boot into MacOS, it was also not detected. ( I'm holding the Option key to choose Startup Disk ) It show the Internet Recory option only.  Please help me! I got a lot of projects to do. :s  <comment91492> Try booting into internet recovery and verifying/reparing the disk and disk permissions using Disk Utility. <comment91534> I tried those options. Verifying/Reparing are grayed out so I can't do the operation. Then on Internet Recovery, my only option is to reinstall MacOS, but when Installation path was asked, there are no partitions available to installed with.  Maybe I gonna try Disk Warrior to repair the partitions.
