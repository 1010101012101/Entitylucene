How to reorganize Icon view <body> After I delete and/or add files to a folder, the icon view is screwed up (see screenshot). How do I  reorganize it? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hY8iP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer217627> In Finder, you can just Control - click (hold down Control on the keyboard, then click the mouse / trackpad), and from the menu that pops up, select Cleanup By - Name, or however you'd like to sort the items.  <comment263069> I see "Arrange By", not "Cleanup By", but it does the job. Thanks.
