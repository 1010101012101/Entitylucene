Unable to delete a file/folder <body> I've got a pretty scary problem. Yesterday I wanted to empty the trash but somewhere in the process it just hung up. I rebooted a few times and tried it again and again but with no result.  I then used the terminal to delete the files out of the .Trash folder manually and I could narrow down the problem to one particular file/folder that I can't delete. strongIf I try coderm -rfv &lt;file/foldername&gt;/code it just hangs up/strong. Even if I try to get more infos about the file/folder with codels -l/code it will hang up.  I also tried to repair the volume using disk utility with no success.  <answer29618> Tricky indeed, things to try  ul listeps recommended by Apple (HT1526) but it seems you did most of them already/li liremove and recreate the whole trash folder: codecd ~; rm -rf .Trash; mkdir .Trash; chmod 700 .Trash/code/li lidelete by inode: codecd .Trash; ls -i/code should give you the inode number; codefind . -inum INODE -exec rm {} \;/code deletes by inode number/li lihack rmi.c to compile under Mac OSX and use this to remove by inode directly (I haven't tested this)/li liboot into Recovery Mode (on Lion) or from DVD (Snow Leopard and earlier) and run fsck/volume repair/li liboot into single user mode (HT1492) and run fsck/volume repair/li /ul  <comment33992> Try the "secure delete" option from the Finder menu. It'll delete even files that are in use, without the need for terminal commands. <comment33994> Thank you very much for your answer! The inode trick is pretty cool, didn't know yet. But nevertheless I'm feeling a little dumb now. The problem with the undeletable file/folder existed since yesterday and even between reboots. And the moment I wanted to test your inode technique the file/folder had just vanished. I have no idea where it went. A weird feeling remains... <comment33995> Thanks, tried it already but didn't help.
