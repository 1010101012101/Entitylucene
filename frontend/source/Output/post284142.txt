IOS : connect to router when "no internet" detected <body> I been through a few topic online but can't fine a solution.  Sometime my internet is offline, and iOS won't let met connect to the local network anymore so I can access the router settings or other local server.  The router have DHCP reservations but my iOS getting the IP automatically, however same issue if I setup a manual IP.  Anyway work around ?  <answer284180> I actually managed to connect by entering the IP and router IP manually   <comment358344> It should let you do this. Go to settings and choose your network. Then there may be a pop-up that says "no internet connection detected. Connect anyway?" Then hit yes. Does this not work?
