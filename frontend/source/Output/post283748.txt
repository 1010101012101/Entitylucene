Wrong company name is seen in TestFlight mails <body> I have checked my company's developer account and check name over there. I have found the company name proper, that is "MY COMAPANY NAME strongInc./strong" but while me and my clients get TestFlight invitations, they see company name with "MY COMAPANY NAME pvt. ltd." as following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y2umh.png" alt="enter image description here"  What may be the reason for that ?
