Search through terminal history with up and down keys in OS X Lion <body> After I upgraded to OS X I am not able to use my ~/.inputrc bindings to search through the shell command history:  precode# these allow you to start typing a command and # use the up/down arrow to auto complete from # commands in your history "\e[B": history-search-forward "\e[A": history-search-backward /code/pre  Any idea what I have to change or do? Are there any default keys for that I could use?  <answer26895> The up/down history scrolling in Terminal only works in codebash/code, not codesh/code. Try typing codebash/code in Terminal, and see whether the arrow keys work. If this is the case, you can go to preferences and set your default login shell to code/bin/bash/code.  <comment29640> I don't know what could be wrong, but for comparison my .inputrc has the same bindings as yours and they work (Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1). In fact, if I remove my .inputrc altogether, the arrow keys still work, since by default they map to similar history commands, as shown by `bind -P`. What happens to the up/down arrow keys if you remove (or rename) your .inputrc file?
