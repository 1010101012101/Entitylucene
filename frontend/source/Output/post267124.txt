iPhone 5 Car Bluetooth Issue with Incoming Phone Calls <body> I have an iPhone 5 running iOS 10.2 and a 2015 Chevy Mailbu with Bluetooth capability for calls and streaming audio (non CarPlay).  The problem I have is when I am strongreceiving/strong calls (everything else works fine).  When a call comes in and I answer it, regardless if I press the phone button on the steering wheel or the answer button on the phone, the iPhone immediately switches to its internal speaker  I have to manually switch it back to the "Bluetooth headset" (car speakerphone) for the audio to work properly.  I have tested this in 3 different cars - the Chevy, an Infiniti and a truck with an aftermarket Kenwood radio.  The problem is present in all three vehicles.  I have also tested with a Windows Phone and and Android phone and both phones work with the cars properly so it's definitely a phone issue.  I have rebooted the iPhone, deleted the profile and re-paired with the radio and I have even reset the iPhone to factory default and re-paired it as if it was new.  The problem persists no matter what I do.  strongDoes anyone know what the issue is or what I have to do to solve it?/strong  [Update] Problem still persists after strongiOS 10.3, didn't resolve the issue./strong    <comment335080> I have an Anker SoundSync in my truck and I have to do the exact same thing when answering a call.  It's very frustrating and I haven't been able to find a solution yet, either. <comment335093> What version of iOS do you have installed on your iPhone 5?
