Retrieve iPad content saved on device (in Kindle app) <body> I have an older iPad Air, that has the Kindle app.   Over the past 3 years I downloaded a number of books - most NOT from amazon. I have books from different sites, that may not exist anymore - or books that were free and now the free versions are no longer available online.  All these books show in the Kindle app, on "Device" tab. They do not show in my Amazon account.  My iPad has suffered a fall, and also because of keeping it open, and in charger, to read or play games or watch videos... its battery is pretty much gone. I need to change the battery or something - which means, I need to back up my system. I expect every day my iPad will simply become a paperweight.. so I really want to back up all these books.   So far I found no way to get the books stored in the iPad, in Kindle app, to either a PC or my newer iPad. I have searched online and asked customer support - all I get is ways to share content already in the Amazon account.  How can I send the offline - strongon device/strong - content from the old iPad to either a PC or another iPad or to maybe to the Amazon account (as documents maybe) ? Is it possible to do any sort of backup ?  <comment368021> I have heard of transferring books and PDFs from iBooks before, but the Kindle App might be a bit more tricky. <comment368022> Similar Question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/190105/can-i-sync-non-amazon-books-from-the-ipad-kindle-app-to-a-pc <comment368023> @RushilSrivastava - you are right, and the linked question has no answer. So - that means it is simply not possible to ever transfer or backup  anything downloaded directly on the iPad ? <comment368024> You can try [iExplorer](https://macroplant.com/iexplorer) from Macroplant, or similar apps, which allow you to gain access to most files on the iPad that are invisible, or unavailable for transfer because of a limited or nonexistent interface. It's not free, and you should download the free trial to find out if these files can be extracted. _Disclaimer:_ Satisfied customer of Macroplant LLC - no financial ties whatsoever.
