iTerm2 doesn't read com.googlecode.iterm2.plist <body> I am iTerm2 (1.0.0) user. I know how to create profiles, by using iTerm settings or modifying codecom.googlecode.iterm2.plist/code file.  For convenience, I will use code.plist/code to indicate codecom.googlecode.iterm2.plist/code file.  There are some profiles already to connect my dev server using a command. (i.e. codessh 192.168.1.1/code).  I want to modify and add more profiles to iTerm. So, I wrote a Python script to do this. The procedure is like below.  ol liConvert iTerm2 code.plist/code file to code.xml/code. (i.e. codeplutil -convert xml1/code)/li liWrite several profiles to this file using codeplistlib/code in Python./li liConvert iTerm2 code.plist/code file to binary format that as it was. (i.e. codeplutil -convert binary1/code)/li /ol  The procedure above doesn't work. iTerm2 didn't load my profiles created from my Python script.  So, I checked if there is no code.plist/code file, how iTerm load the profiles.  ol liI quit the iTerm2 program./li liI deleted the code.plist/code file from my disk, which is located at code~/Library/Preferences//code./li liRun iTerm2 program./li liopen Profile Setting by typing kbdâŒ˜ Cmd/kbd+kbdO/kbd./li /ol  I found there are profiles even if I deleted the code.plist/code file. What happened here? Is there any backup profiles file which I don't recognize?  <answer111559> Preferences are cached in 10.9. See http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130908042828630. If you edit a plist file directly or replace the plist of an application, the application will keep using the cached version even after you quit and reopen the application.  You can run codedefaults read com.googlecode.iterm2/code or codekillall cfprefsd/code to apply the changes:  ol liQuit iTerm/li liEdit the plist/li liRun codedefaults read com.googlecode.iterm2/code or codekillall cfprefsd/code/li liOpen iTerm/li /ol  Changes made with codedefaults/code are applied after you just quit and reopen an application like in earlier versions of OS X.  hr  <answer167143> Having great trouble migrating iTerm2 (2.0.0) plist to my new Mac running Yosemite (10.10.1). What I did to fix that is:  ol liOpen iTerm2, so a default codecom.googlecode.iterm2.plist/code file is created./li liQuit iTerm2/li liDeleted all cached preferences for iterm2 by issuing codedefaults delete com.googlecode.iterm2/code/li liCopied the file to the new Mac in the correct location inside Preferences folder, so I had my old profiles and settings back/li liRead in the prefs file with codedefaults read -app iTerm/code/li liOpen iTerm2 and was happy to have profiles and window arrangements on my new Mac/li /ol  <comment131233> That's great, this is what I found. Thanks a lot. And I am sorry posting duplicated question, I didn't know where I have to post this stuffs. And I am enjoying my iTerm. :) <comment131234> Thanks 'Jawa' for editing my posting to be more good looking. :) <comment237384> Thanks this worked. One more requirement I found out the hard way is that the iTerm version of the saved profile should match the version of the current iTerm (where you're migrating to). <comment271236> Thanks for for the `defaults read -app`, I was looking for a way to read any app's prefs file and didn't know how! <comment298691> Fabulous.  Thank you! <comment321693> oh hell yeah! thanks buddy, it worked
