My MacBook re-boots when going into sleep - tips for analyzing problems? <body> since a few days my 2010 MacBook Pro re-boots on a regular basis. I'm looking for tips on how to diagnose the cause of the problem.  Usually my MacBook (running Mavericks) is sitting on my desk, plugged into power, a large screen, and a powered USB hub (which in turn usually just connects to my iPod). When I unplug it and close the lid, it doesn't go into sleep mode but instead re-boots after a few minutes. This has been consistently happening for about a weak.  I am unaware of any hardware or software changes that have recently occurred.  Which logs should I study? What other tools are there that may help me to pin down the problem?  Thanks for any helpful hints.

That one will display who is waking up your computer.  .  ul liIn Terminal (also in Utility folder)/li /ul  Type codepmset -g assertions/code  That one will tell you your sleep mode settings (and possibly show who is waking it up)  You can copy and paste that information in here if you want us to look at it.  Update:  Please disable the MagicWake and try without it!  You can do that with: Sytem Preferences, Energy Saver then uncheck the Wake For Ethernet network access, and the MAGICWAKE should disappear!  <comment153617> The problem occurs when the computer goes to sleep, not when it's waking up. Will the information still help? <comment153619> to quote you: When I unplug it and close the lid, it doesn't go into sleep mode but instead re-boots after a few minute. So we are looking for what it wakes it up..(re-boot).That is what I answered. <comment153621> I appreciate your help .. maybe my description wasn't clear :-) When I close the lid or unplug the cables, the computer locks up (instead of going to sleep). The reboot seems to be "automatic" .. <comment153622> OK, that's new information :) could you still provide the information please. <comment153624> Wake reason is usually EC LID0 <comment153640> I was hoping for more lines trying to discover what makes it shut down and restart. <comment153641> @IronGoofy how is that possible if it restarts as you say. So when you open the Lid the computer restarts ? <comment153653> next time it happens, instead of `pmset` try `tail -n30 /private/var/log/system.log` and paste the log after you get logged back in, and maybe that will give Buscarì›ƒ what he needs to see what's happening. <comment153668> When I open the lid, I can tell it has restarted. As usual with Mavericks, all apps are restarted as well, but you can tell from the open documents (and also some running services) that a restart has happened.
