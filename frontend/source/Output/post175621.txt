Unable to delete IMAP mail account in Yosemite <body> I have an IMAP mail account in the Apple Mail client that I want to delete.  I first goto the Accounts preferences pane in Mail.  When I click the minus icon to delete the account, I get a message about having to do it in Internet Accounts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c4wjt.png" width="420" title="Internet Accounts"  However, when I goto Internet Accounts, the email account isn't listed.  I see all of my mail accounts except for this particular one.   How can I delete this mail account?  <answer188759> This is not my Fix I found it here  Find and Open the Folder Where Mac OS X Mail Stores Mail.

Now all the Accounts will get deleted from mail   <comment207167> ok, so what kind of mail is it (from whom)? your Yosemite says it is in Internet Accounts ? <comment207168> A custom domain with Windows Live email (now through Outlook.com).  It's not an actual @outlook.com email, rather using that service with a custom domain. <comment207169> It is listed on the Accounts pane of the Mail settings, but not in Internet Accounts.  Very weird.  Also, I do have other accounts with the same type of service (custom domain from Outlook) that show up fine. <comment207170> How did you install it in first place ? <comment207175> Does it show the "Enable this Account" checked in Mail accounts? You must had set it up manually.
