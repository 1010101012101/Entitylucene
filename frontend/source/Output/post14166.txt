Location of error icon <body> Where is the location of the error and the warning icon? I'm talking about the red octagon with a ! inside it and the yellow triangle also containing a !.  Example: http://www.askdavetaylor.com/1-blog-pics/mac-usb-device-removal-error.png  <answer14168> I remember that some system app had both icons in its application bundle, which you can open by dragging it to Preview.app.  A little note: Apple doesn't want you to use these icons as they are reserved for the system only.  hr  You can find the Warning icon by dragging /System/Library/Core Services/Problem Reporter.app to Preview.app. Save the ICNS file as PNG and you're good to go â€” even though it's not a 512 &times; 512 image.  hr  You can find a small error (32 &times; 32) icon at /Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsInterface.framework/Versions/A/Resources/XCBuildBadge-Error.png.  <answer14169> code/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/AlertStopIcon.icns/code
