Where do I find the "Show Addresses" option in Yosemite Mail? <body> I have just upgraded to OS X Yosemite.  In Apple Mail I normally send email to groups.   In my old version of Mail I would press the "Show Addresses" icon in the toolbar and select an email group, however I do not have this icon on the new version.  I've tried to customise the Toolbar, but "Show Addresses" is no longer an option.  What is the best way to resolve this?  <answer202946> Yosemite now has this feature built into the to field, at the end is a blue circle with a plus (+) symbol. Click this for a pop over with the Address Book.  I don't have groups so I presume this is what you need, but I can't confirm.  <answer203007> Just start to type the group name &amp; select from the drop menu or hit Enter once it's found the correct group.br All group members will be included as recipients.  See How to create a private distribution list [group mailing list] in Mail.app? for a related question/answer.
