Disable or Mute Trash Sound <body> How can I disable the sound when deleting a file from Finder in OS X Mountain Lion?  I do not see any specific mention of it under System Preferences or Finder Preferences. I don't want to disable other sounds; just that one.  <answer101722> The sound file for moving an item to the trash is located here:  Go to your HD  System  Library  Components  CoreAudio.component (right click and choose "Show Package Contents")  Contents  SharedSupport  SystemSounds  dock  "drag to trash.aif"  This "drag to trash.aif" is the sound file responsible for the audio effect.  Back up the current file just incase and replace it with a silent one (a quick google search will do - you might need to get the silent file as mp3 and then convert it to aif).  You may need to restart for it to take effect.  <comment119821> Are you using Mountain Lion? <comment119826> Yes, thanks. I've updated the question. <comment148392> adding the path for easier access in the Terminal /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds You only need to restart Finder (from the Force Quit Applications dialog). <comment349947> 10.12.4 doesn't let me do this for some reason even when I'm logged in as root and prefix cp/mv/whatever with "sudo". Does anyone know what would be a good way to replace it? If it's safe, it would also be convenient if I could store the copy in the same folder as the original.
