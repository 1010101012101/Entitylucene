Moved my time machine backup drive to another computer, can see it but won't recognise old backups <body> I've been using an external hard drive on my MacBook for time machine for a year or so. Now I have a Mac Mini too and have connected the external hard drive to that for the same purpose.  I want to leave it connected to my Mac Mini and still backup to it wirelessly from my laptop.  I have done all the steps to allow time machine to recognise network drives and I can see the drive from my laptop etc., but it won't recognise the old backups.   Do I need to change the file permissions or similar to get it working?  <answer105696> Just Just go into codeSystem Preferences/code … codeTime Machine/code and hit codeSelect Disk…/code   (If that's not working, let us know what error you're getting/what does happen.)  <comment124263> More info at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/68766/33389
