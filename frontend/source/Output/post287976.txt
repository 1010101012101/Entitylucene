Is Keychain storing my ssh passphrase correctly? <body> I'm pretty sure I'm using my keychain to access my passphrase for ssh (.ssh/config includes codeUseKeychain yes/code). I don't ever have to enter my passphrase to ssh. However, I ran across this. It details that even after restarting a computer and locking the keychain, ssh still does not require that the passphrase be entered. The steps to reproduce (from the link)  ul liSet up SSH for another computer, using a key with a passphrase  +Set "UseKeychain yes" as described in "man ssh_config" or TN2449: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2449/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017589/li liRestart your Mac (in case there are any keys already loaded by ssh-agent)/li liImmediately lock the default "login" keychain in Keychain Access/li liOpen Terminal/li liOptional: use "ssh-add -D" to make sure no identities are already loaded (in my testing this makes no difference)/li liAttempt to connect to the other computer using SSH/li /ul  Like the asker, these steps allow me to ssh properly. Could I be authenticating some way other than with my passphrase through the keychain? If not, how am I able to ssh?
