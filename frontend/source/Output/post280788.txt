bash exits with interrupt, etc. how to stop? <body> when i send an interrupt i get:  precodeSaving session... ...copying shared history... ...saving history...truncating history files... ...completed.  [Process completed] /code/pre  i also get this when processes have problems and exit. i do not want this. i want bash to reinstate in the same terminal window. how do i get this outcome rather than having to open a new tab / window / terminal instance?
