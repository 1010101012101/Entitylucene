Is it possible to left-align the URL in the Safari address bar? <body> As of Safari 8 on OS X Yosemite, URLs in the URL bar are displayed centered. This looks really nice, but I’m a web developer and I often need to change just part of an URL to test something. To do that, I need to click somewhere on the URL, reposition my cursor over the newly-left-aligned address, and then click again to place the insertion point.  Is there a way to get Safari to display URLs left-aligned all the time?  <answer193198> Not sure it's exactly what you want, but kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd L /kbd will select &amp; left align, same as if you'd clicked it - so you could do it as you're mousing towards it.  <comment230135> Not quite what I was looking for but it’s a good tip. Thanks. <comment230137> btw, if the URL's long enough, it's always left-aligned, just not if it's short :(
