"Find My iPhone" locked my Mac <body> Yesterday my MacBook Pro started to be blocked.  When it boots it asks for the password for the Guest account. No password is right. According to various sources of information I found on the Web, this may mean that the computer has been locked from iCloud using "Find My iPhone".  From https://www.icloud.com/#find the Macbook seems to be blocked:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vr1de.png" alt="enter image description here"  But there is no "unlock" button on iCloud:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwCB4.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I click "Play Sound" a sound is effectively played by the Macbook:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hgSzi.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  "Find My iPhone" is not able to locate the computer's location, but it is here, on my desk!  When I power off the MacBook Pro something changes on https://www.icloud.com/#find and a button "Remove from Account" appears. After I clicked that button the MacBook Pro is removed from the device listing. But as soon as I reboot the Macbook will reappear in the listing.  I don't understand what is wrong: I own the computer, I own the iCloud/Apple ID account but I can neither use it, nor unlock it.  I tried to call Apple, today they won't respond (today it's Sunday, tomorrow is a holiday in my country.) I can't wait till tuesday.  Do you know how to solve my issue?  <answer179678> Solved following these steps.  ol liRemoved my macbook from iCloud/li liFollowed this guide: http://www.tomsguide.com/forum/id-1317787/unlock-apple-macbook-pro.html/li /ol  <comment213077> It doesn't look locked? Can't you just log in with your mac's user password? <comment213079> @KevinGrabher I can't enter my username, only the guest account seems available. <comment213080> Isn't that your user that can be seen on the screenshot? <comment213081> If you can get into the guest account open system preferences there and check if your user exists in the Users & Groups pane. If yes, activate Fast User Switching and try switching over that way <comment213083> I can't get into the guest account, the system asks for a password even for the Guest account. <comment213085> What's it say when you enter your iCloud password? <comment213089> It behaves like when the password is wrong. <comment213091> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/22588/discussion-between-andrea-francia-and-kevin-grabher).
