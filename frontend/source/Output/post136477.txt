How to remap 'Shift & Up/Down arrow keys' to type actual up & down arrows? <body> I do a lot of typing in Evernote and I really need an 'up arrow' and 'down arrow' instead of typing 'increasing' or 'decreasing'... Ideally pressing Shift and 'Up arrow' would be the best way to get an upward arrow. I've downloaded and tried using KeyRemap4Macbook but I can't work out how to get the up or down arrows.   <answer136478> KeyRemap4MacBook currently can't insert arbitrary text. For something like this, I'd recommend using DefaultKeyBinding.dict.  Create code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code and enter  precode{ "$\Uf700" = (insertText:, "↑"); "$\Uf701" = (insertText:, "↓"); } /code/pre  supcode$/code = shift, code\Uf700/code = up, code\Uf701/code = down, codeinsertText:/code will insert a string at the current cursor location/sup  Quit and reopen applications for the change to take effect
