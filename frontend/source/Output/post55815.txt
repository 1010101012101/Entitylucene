How do I sync my Google calendar with my iPhone? <body> So I have set up my calendar on Google. I am trying to get it to sync those changes to my calendar application on my iPhone 4S. I currently have under "Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars" the following accounts:   ul liiCloud (Contacts, Calendars and 5 more..)/li liExchange (Mail, Calendars, Reminders)/li liGmail (Calendars, Notes)  /li /ul  Fetch New Data is set to Push/Every 15 minutes. What am I not doing right? Thanks!  <answer55816> A quick search led me to this step-by-step guide to sync Google Calendar with iPhone.  http://support.google.com/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=138740  <answer61405> Very simple way to do this:  ol liPlug your phone into your computer/li liLaunch iTunes/li liClick on the info tab then check "Sync Contacts" and "Sync Google Contacts"/li liCheck "Sync Calendars" and select "All Calendars"/li liGo to https://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect and make sure you have selected that you want to sync this calendar. /li /ol  You should now be done, in 15 minutes time everything should sync up nicely.  <comment64054> Tried this guide sorry I didn't put that in the question ;/.  Perhaps I need to undo my GMAIL account calendar sync and have only this one.  I'll see if that works and post back the results thanks! <comment70877> Can you put a digest of the steps to do this in your answer? As it is, your answer is only a link and links do rot, at which point your answer would be useless. <comment232669> Wow how did you find https://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect? That's not in the settings anywhere. The iPhone already lets you select Calendars. Why does Google make you select calendars to synch also?
