Looking for a lightweight MP3 player for OS X <body> I'm looking for something, preferably free, to play MP3s in OS X in a way they don't automatically get dumped into iTunes. Any suggestions?  Songbird is not lightweight.  VLC I use for videos.  <answer14763> On Finder, click the mp3, press kbdspace/kbd or kbd^/kbd+kbdY/kbd.  It will open a strongQuick Look/strong window and that will preview your mp3.  <answer14764> If you prefer a dedicated app rather than use strongQuick Look/strong, check strongVox/strong, emthe lightweight music app for Mac OS X/em.br It's free but you can donate.  <answer14786> Quicktime player. Quicktime player.  <answer18299> SimpleSong seems to be exactly what you are searching for - this is as simple as it gets, basically just a searchbar. You can now also drag tracks from the finder to the dock icon, to open the tracks as a playlist.   <comment15882> I meant play, thanks <comment15884> It is perfect!! <comment15887> @idober Quick Look does play the mp3 and offers basic controls: play/pause and a scrubber for changing position in the track. However it only works if you don't leave the Finder or click on anything else in Finder. Still, I wanted to clarify that for future people reading this question. <comment15908> Just did a quick test playing a 44mb mp3 with Vox and QuickTime, both the lastest versions. Quickly scrubbing the mp3 back and forth used the most processor, just playing it was non-max usage. **Vox**: cpu 2.3%, cpu max 5.0%, memory 11.3mb. **QuickTime**: cpu 2.8%, cpu max 7.1%, memory 35.4mb. **Conclusion**: neither is a pig, but Vox is definitely lighter, especially in memory use. <comment15911> I wonder why someone downvoted my answer. Quicktime is free (as in beer) and light. That's what i use anyway when I don't want to add mp3's to my iTunes library. <comment15912> +1: I think QuickTime Player is a reasonable suggestion here. <comment15915> I don't know, @Rafael, your answer is certainly completely valid, even if it's not what the OP ended up using. <comment15981> Didn't know about this! Great! I'll be using this <comment19994> If you use column view, you can also use the preview column to play it, and it won't stop playing if you switch applications or windows. <comment79969> vox does not work currently with 10.8.1 unfortunately. Just putting it out there. <comment252357> Whats happened to the Vox link? <comment252360> @Chris link updated, thanks <comment337865> I'd say that Vox is not lightweight.  It requires you to make playlists instead of just playing all the highlighted files.  Most of the time I just want to play a few songs (organized in folders) without searching through the thousands in my playlist. <comment337866> Quicktime player won't play more than one song back-to-back. <comment337867> Works perfectly for playing just one song.  But if you want anymore (like say, an album) you're out of luck. <comment337869> New versions of the OS have replaced SimpleSong with Quick Look.  And in the time, it has gotten less compatible (and therefore buggy).  Too bad; it looked pretty nice.
