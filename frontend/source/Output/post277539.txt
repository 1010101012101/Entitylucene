Force iCloud to sync <body> Here is my scenario:  ol liI save a file in my iCloud drive on my Mac running OSX 10.12.3/li liI would like to use that file on my iPhone running iOS 10.0.2/li liBoth devices are connected to wifi/li liLooking in the iCloud drive on the iPhone, the file will not show up until an indeterminate amount of time later/li /ol  How can I force it to sync emright now/em? At the moment, emailing the file to myself and "check for mail" is more reliable, which kind of defeats the point of having a shared folder between devices in the first place...
