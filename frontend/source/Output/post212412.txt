How can I set the Mac OS X terminal history to act like linux when using up/down arrows? <body> I'd like for the mac os terminal app to scroll through my command history the same way that it work in linux, if possible. Currently, if I push the up arrow in the terminal, it will scroll through strongeach and every one/strong of my recent commands strongeven if the last 50 were the same exact command/strong. On most linux systems I've used, this behavior will scroll backwards through command history, but most importanlty it will strongskip duplicate commands/strong. Is this behavior possible in Mac OS X terminal app, or do I need to use a different terminal app? Thanks.  <answer212417> Mark who commented on my questions above was correct. This is a bash setting. If you add the following to your code~/.bash_profile/code script, you will get this behavior.  precodeHISTCONTROL=ignoredups /code/pre  You can also ignore any lines that start with a space:  precodeHISTCONTROL=ignorespace /code/pre  Or do both, by using:  precodeHISTCONTROL=ignoreboth /code/pre  <answer212418> Assuming that you are using bash then  precodeHISTCONTROL=ignoreboth /code/pre  or  precodeHISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups /code/pre  in one of your bash rc file(s).  <comment256504> This is not the action of the Terminal app but how you have set up your shell - probably bash see its documentation for history <comment256506> Strictly better add to  .bashrc and make .bash_profile source .bashrc - see bash manual <comment257263> Also check out iTerm2.  IMO it's a better tool.  http://www.iterm2.com
