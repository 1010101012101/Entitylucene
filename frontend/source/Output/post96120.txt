How to use a different mirror of macports rather than the offical mirrors? <body> How to use a different mirror rather than the mirrors in the list?  Well, I mean not only download codeport.tar/code from other mirror, like the question here, but also download packages from a different mirror.  I have noticed that when downloading packages, the codeport/code just download packages from this link. But I don't know how to change the mirror it get packages from.  Many thanks!  I will appreciate every answer or comment.  <comment112886> Duplicate: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8693375/how-to-change-the-mirror-of-macports <comment112898> @KeithSmiley If it is duplicate, I would not ask it again. The [ustc](http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/macports/) mirror has only the ports files, but I am asking a different question. You can check the links in my question to know it is not DUPLICATE. Thanks for your comment. <comment113345> That SO question and http://superuser.com/questions/473186/how-to-change-macports-default-mirrors will work for any mirror just use the path. But Macports is only on the mirrors on that list - where do you want to read it from <comment113349> @Mark From a computer in my University. I am to setup a mirror for me and other students. A case as I have noticed is that, even if I have downloaded the tar.gz or zip file and I put it in the right location, It will also download from the given mirror. <comment113350> If you have a mirror like that then just rsync the whole lot or ask the system administrators how they maintain the computers and use that tool <comment113351> @Mark Thanks, I will try to contact them. It is really a good idea than to ask here than directly contact them.
