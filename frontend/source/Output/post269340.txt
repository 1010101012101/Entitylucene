Can you automate a sequence of actions within Safari on iOS? <body> I'm wondering about the limitations of automation on the iOS platform. There are a number of automation apps, such as Workflow or IFTTT, but how far can you go?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFYwl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  To increase the overal usability on my springboard I moved my apps down by adding dummy-apps (Webpage shortcuts) with a piece of the background as app-icon, which you can see slightly (normally it blends perfectly, just for example purpose now).  This can be achieved by.   ol liScreenshot your springboard on a free page/li liGo to a certain website (forgot URL..)/li liUpload your screenshot/li liOpen each cut-out icon one by one (can be targeted by HTML class names)/li liSave to springboard/li /ol  This is a time-consuming task. It doesn't cost you an hour to do so, but you'll require more than just a minute. I was hoping I could automate that process a bit, specially step 3-5. However, I'm unsure where the limitations end of the automation on iOS.   Can you let the device go to a certain webpage and perform actions in sequence?
