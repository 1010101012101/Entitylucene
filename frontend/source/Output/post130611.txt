Aperture and exporting videos and photos at the same time <body> I just bought Aperture, as a last ditch attempt to try and get a good export of all of my "projects" (photos and videos in many of the projects) into folders named by event/project. I tried first using the Unified library (my source is originally iPhoto), and then brought them in via a complete library import.   What happens is this, when I select:  ol liAll of the projects in the Projects view, I can only Export Library. /li liIf I go to Photos view, and select all, I can do the Export Versions and get all of the photos cleanly exported. BUT no videos are exported. All videos are MP4 and completely fine in iPhoto/Quicktime. /li liI can set a filter in Photos to show only Video, and the files show up fine, but I seemingly have to export them separately which is not ideal. They should export embedded in the Project./li /ol  I've also tried iPhoto To Disk, but it has its own bugs and they have been unable to resolve them. (Double folders, some files don't export, etc.)  I've spent about $150 now trying to do the simplest thing, export about 5,000 photos and videos to:br 2008-8-Baby photosbr 2009-9-Dog photosbr etc.br (All events are named as above, so it's using project names vs EXIF dates)  Can anyone help? I can use iPhoto OR Aperture, but since I paid for Aperture and it's more flexible, I feel like I should get some use out of it :)  (At this point I just can't justify $140 for Lightroom, or commit to their CC to get it...)  <answer130618> While this doesn't answer your question precisely, this may help prevent frustration attempting to export all photos and all videos simultaneously.  Create a smart album in Aperture or in iPhoto setting conditions to find all the video like in the image below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sNkX4.png" alt="smart album all the video"  Its just not clear what video formats are compatible with Aperture or iPhoto, so adding every format you can think of to these conditions won't hurt anything.  Once the smart album is created, you can select all the videos in the album and export them in one step.  hr  hr  h1Alternatives/h1     (At this point I just can't justify $140 for Lightroom, or commit to their CC to get it...)   h2darktable/h2  Alternatively, for an application more powerful than iPhoto, and holds its own against Lightroom or Aperture, I've discovered darktable, which      "is an open source photography workflow application and RAW developer. A virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images and enhance them."   darktable can be installed manually, but is also maintained as a port using MacPorts, if you prefer to use package management. I've included step by step instructions for installing MacPorts and darktable below.  hr  h3GIMP/h3  An extremely powerful alternative to editing photos is using the GIMP. The GIMP can be installed manually, or built from source using MacPorts. I've included instructions below on how to install the GIMP using MacPorts.Â If you know Adobe Photoshop well, you may want to demo using GIMPshop, which very cleverly and conveniently reconstructs the look and feel of the GIMP to appear and behave nearly just like Photoshop... and its all for free.  hr  h1MacPorts/h1  MacPorts is a robust, stable, mature and easy to use package management solution, for OS X. It is modeled after FreeBSD's ports system, which has been adopted as the basis of NetBSD's pkgsrc. I highly recommend MacPorts.   h2install Xcode 5.1.1/h2  MacPorts requires an appropriate version of xcode; xcode_5.1.1.dmg is the most recent version for Mavericks (after registerring for a free developer account, and logging into developer.apple.com, that link will begin your xcode download). Once the download completes, lets just do it all in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app (don't be afraid of the terminal!):   precode goodytx@stack:~$   goodytx@stack:~$ hdiutil attach -quiet -noverify -nobrowse -noautoopen ~/Downloads/xcode_5.1.1.dmg  goodytx@stack:~$ cp -npR /Volumes/Xcode/Xcode.app /Applications/  goodytx@stack:~$ hdiutil detach -quiet /Volumes/Xcode  goodytx@stack:~$ open -g /Applications/Xcode.app; sleep 8  goodytx@stack:~$   goodytx@stack:~$ killall Xcode.app /code/pre  h2install MacPorts/h2  Get to know  MacPorts  precode goodytx@stack:~$   goodytx@stack:~$   goodytx@stack:~$ curl -Ok https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2  goodytx@stack:~$ tar xf MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2  goodytx@stack:~$ cd MacPorts-2.2.1  goodytx@stack:~$ ./configure  goodytx@stack:~$ make  goodytx@stack:~$ sudo make install     # *not war!*  goodytx@stack:~$ cd ..  goodytx@stack:~$ rm -rf Macports-*  goodytx@stack:~$ sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate  goodytx@stack:~$ diskutil quiet repairPermissions /  goodytx@stack:~$   goodytx@stack:~$  /code/pre  h3add MacPorts to your $PATH:/h3  precode goodytx@stack:~$   goodytx@stack:~$ export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH  goodytx@stack:~$ export MANPATH=/opt/local/share/ man:$MANPATH  goodytx@stack:~$  /code/pre  h3install darktable and the gimp/h3  precode goodytx@stack:~$  goodytx@stack:~$   goodytx@stack:~$ port info darktable  darktable @1.1.2_5 (graphics)  Variants:             gcc44, gcc45, gcc46, gcc47, gnome_keyring, quartz, universal, [+]x11   Description:          Darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers: it manages your digital                        negatives in a database and lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable.

The only thing running was Generating Previews. Did that need to finish before it exported videos? And if so why did the export task complete? ;) <comment153193> @ goodytx : try giving darktable and gimp or gimpshop a look to see if they meet your needs... all free. If interested, see the _Alternatives_ section of my answer below, and say _I'm not gonna pay a lot for this professional RAW photo management system!_ Cheers! <comment153247> Thanks chillin, very comprehensive! Note, there's a way to do the filter in iPhoto where Photo is Video in a smart album. Not sure if that would catch all videos for everyone, but mine were all painstakingly and annoyingly converted to be compatible :) <comment153250> @goodytx Thanks... that must be a new feature, as it is not there in iPhoto 6, which I am still using because it is blazingly fast (I got sick of facial recognition slowdowns!). <comment153581> @chillin I'll give darktable a look also. Not sure why I'm so dedicated to the Apple apps; I rarely even use the media sharing/picking features. I miss the old days when you had folders-on-a-frickin-disk and could arrange them however you wanted!
