There may be an app for it somewhere on the App Store, though.  <answer16618> You may refer to this guide, it's regarding how to download website video to computer for free. It works pretty well for me.  <answer19024> You can get an app called Azul that replicates that functionality.  If you jailbreak it you can get Safari Download Manager, but without jailbreaking your iPad the only way is through apps.  <comment51062> What kind of video? Is it YouTube? Is it Flash? <comment69741> Is there a proof link? <comment71194> @timothymh Just a straight-up .m4v file stored on a remote server. No Flash or anything like that.
