Unable to get IPv6 lease on Airport Extreme (5th gen) <body> I have an A1408 5th generation airport extreme that isn't taking/getting an IPv6 address from my ISP. I live in a building where the ISP provides service over Ethernet, so setup is basically the Airport-Ethernet, no other router. If I connect a mac book pro directly to the Ethernet cable, it picks up both a v4 and v6 address as I'd expect.  I've tried doing a factory reset on the Airport and starting from scratch - "Configure IPv6: Automatically," "IPv6 Mode: Native," and "Enable IPv6 Connection Sharing" is selected. I get a link-local IP for the "IPv6 Default Route" but no IPv6 WAN address.  The Airport Extreme is running firmware version 7.6.4. Looking for suggestions before I just replace the thing, which would be a bummer as I've used Airports since they first came out...
