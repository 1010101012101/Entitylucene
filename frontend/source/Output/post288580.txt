Upgrading to 32GB RAM for Mac Mini Server <body> I'm using Mac Mini Server (Late 2012) with 2,3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB RAM. This type of processor (Intel® Core™ i7-3615QM) supports a max memory size of 32GB. Look at specification: Here.  Is it possible to upgrade a RAM in my Mac Mini to 32GB (for instance a codeCrucial Kit 2x16GB/code)?  I understand that Apple have to update Memory Reference Code in the firmware of the Mac Mini but maybe exists another way to upgrade a memory.  <answer288581> You can be pretty sure that if it's not mentioned in Everymac or sold by OWC[MacSales], it can't be done.br Whether you would choose them as your vendor or not, they tend to cover all possibilities &amp; often support things that Apple never intended.
