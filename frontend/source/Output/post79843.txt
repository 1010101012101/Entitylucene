Finder doesn't starts on Mountain Lion (10.8.2) <body> It happens almost every time after startup. When I click on the Finder it tries to start it, the menubar starts, then the desktop icons disappear for a few seconds then they come back, but the finder window never starts.   Sometimes it says when I try to launch it:     The last time you opened Finder, it unexpectedly quit while reopening windows. Do you want to try to reopen its windows again?      If you choose not to reopen windows, you may have to open and position the windows yourself.   but otherwise I don't get any errors. The same happens with Chrome too.   I usually fix this by restarting the computer like 7-8 times and sometimes it just works. I already repaired the disk permissions. the verify disk says everything is ok.  What could cause this, and how can I fix it?  <answer89072> You can try to reset this apps preferences.  ul liGot to ~/Library/Preferences/li liSearch this folder for files that contain codefinder/code in its' names./li liDelete them/li lilogout and login back/li /ul  <answer144162> This solution worked for me  https://support.filetransporter.com/article/AA-00398  ol liCick the Finder icon in the Dock. /li liFrom the Go menu, choose Utilities. /li liOpen the Terminal app. /li liType: sudo update_dyld_shared_cache -force/li liPress Return./li liWhen prompted, enter your OS X user password, and press Return./li /ol  <comment92159> Are there crash reports in Console.app  System / User Diagnostic Reports? If nothing else works, try doing an upgrade install of OS X from the recovery partition. It shouldn't affect user files, but it's one of the best troubleshooting steps for issues like this.
