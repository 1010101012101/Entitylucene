How do I enable the Sidebar in Finder? <body> I know its a simple menu item somewhere, but I can't find it anywhere! I really want the sidebar to always show when I open a new Finder window. Can anyone tell me how to do this?  <answer61170> Select Finder and click strongView/strong → strongShow Sidebar/strong or press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd + kbdS/kbd.  A tip when it comes to menus: if you go to the Help menu and search for what you want. It will highlight the result in the menu if you hover over it.  <comment70572> Note however that you need to show the toolbar first (View-Show Toolbar), before the Show Sidebar option becomes available. <comment70586> Why did this get downvoted?  Odd. <comment70644> @harv Because it didn't show any research effort. <comment71377> @Lari I did a google search before posting, but I didn't find the answer quickly. <comment249655> What am I to do if `Show Sidebar` is greyed out? http://puu.sh/kkWdS.png
