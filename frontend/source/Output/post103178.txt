ios7 not syncing properly with calendar <body> Upgraded to ios7 this morning and evertything seems fine apart from the calendar.  With ios6 my iphone 4s was syncing the calender fine from Outlook (2010) on my work PC. Now all entries on my iphone are gone and it wont sync with Outlook which is still showing all my appointments.  However, when I create a new appointment in my iphone (ios7) calendar it does not show on the calendar on the iphone yet syncs with Outlook and shows it on my PC calendar.  Help!  <comment121470> Tap `Calendars` at the bottom of the app and then make sure there is a check mark next to your Outlook calendar. The fact that you can create new appointments for it means it has to be there, just not showing for some reason. <comment121608> Thanks tubedog, seems to be working fine now.  Because I had the field above set to 'Show all calendars' I didn't realise I still had to tap on my exchange calendar.
