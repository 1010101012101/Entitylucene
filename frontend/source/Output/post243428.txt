Send photos from Mac to iPhone using iTunes <body> I'm  trying to send photos to my iPhone, using iTunes, but when I select the codePhotos/code section in iTunes, it shows me this (it doesn't let me choose a folder):     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SGucE.png" alt=""   hr  How can I sync a specific folder containing images on my iPhone?  <comment299782> The method you link to in your question is only when you're not using iCloud.  It looks from your screenshot that you're using iCloud.  Are you not able to access the photos from *Finder* or from [iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com)? <comment299785> @fbara I uploaded my photos using `icloud.com`, but I'd like to sync a specific folderâ€”what settings should I change for that?
