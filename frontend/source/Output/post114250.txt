automator to run AppleScript for a shell script <body> For a selected file in Finder, I like to run a perl script using Services. I created an Automator process that runs an AppleScript:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Terminal"         activate         do script "/Users/myaccountname/Applications/TeXcount_3_0/texcount.pl \"" &amp; (input as string) &amp; "\""     end tell end run /code/pre  The only problem is that the selected filename appears as something like:  precode"Macintosh HD:Users:myaccountname:Documents:texfile.tex" /code/pre  which the perl script cannot understand. How can I make it a UNIX-like filename?  <answer114268> You'll need to get the POSIX path of the input file:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Terminal"         activate         do script "/Users/myaccountname/Applications/TeXcount_3_0/texcount.pl \"" &amp; ( POSIX path of input as string) &amp; "\""     end tell end run /code/pre  I found the answer over at StackOverflow.  <answer114420> You can also use codequoted form of/code to escape the arguments:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Terminal"         do script "printf %s\\\\n " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of item 1 of input &amp; "&gt;/tmp/a"     end tell end run /code/pre  Or if the service can receive multiple files as input:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set args to ""     repeat with f in input         set args to args &amp; " " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of f     end repeat     tell application "Terminal"         do script "printf %s\\\\n " &amp; args &amp; "&gt;/tmp/a"     end tell end run /code/pre
