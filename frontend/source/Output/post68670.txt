How do I enable cache in iPad <body> I want to be able to use an HTML5 WebApp, but my iPad won't cache the manifest. The WebApp works on Android and BlackBerry devices, so I know it's not the code.  And is it different for the various iPad versions?   I have the first gen. iPad, but I will need to be able to help folks with more recent iPads.  <answer68671> There is nothing to enable; all versions of iOS Safari on all iOS devices support the cache manifest by default and I'm not aware of any way to turn it off.  Issues you're seeing are probably caused by bugs or unexpected behavior in iOS, Safari, or your code.  <answer70912> precodeSettings &gt; Safari &gt; Accept cookies &gt; Always /code/pre  <comment225725> Haven't tried the above solution yet, but I bet it was the root cause of my client's issues. @SnowboardingBruin: do you know what this setting is set to by default on iPad 1? (quite old iOS, I think 5.0 - 5.1)
