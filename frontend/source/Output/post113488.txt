How can I change the default font size for composing in Sparrow? <body> I use Sparrow as my email client.  Recently, I sent an email with some wacky font sizes.  Now every time I compose a message, the default size is too small.  Even after I fix it, it reverts to the (small) size if I move the cursor to a new spot.  It seems like this would be an easy to find preference for default font and size, but I can't find the darn thing anywhere.  And it doesn't seem to be in Sparrow's online support.  I expect to be embarrassed by the answer, but can anyone point me to the right place?  <answer120874> I figured this out:    I had a problem that my font got changed size 11, and changing back to 13 didn't fix the default - the next email would go back to 11  The solution is this: Type some text and highlight it.  But instead of changing the font in the pulldown above the editing window (which won't change the default), so this instead:  strongWith the text selected, in the top menu select Format  Font  Bigger or Smaller, till it get the size you want./strong  (You can also do this by hitting Command + or Command -.)  Oddly, that fixes the default, while using the normal size toggle doesn't.  <comment234652> Thank you Jadies. Also, the last character of the email after the signature needs to be removed as this can corrupt the font size but not the font itself.
