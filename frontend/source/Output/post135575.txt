Remove Airdrop function to do tightening of OSX <body> Could you tell me how to remove Airdrop function to do tightening of OSX?   Looks somebody accessing my Mac via AirDrop. I would like to remove the function.  Please tell me how to remove the function except for not to turn off.  <answer135611> I did some looking around and came up with that the removing the AirDrop will give you only 150kb of space.  So I am not sure it is wort messing around with it, since I do not know what dependencies are there, and the disk space gain is not worth mentioning it.  You can look it up in your  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShareKit.framework/Versions/A/PlugIns/AirDrop.sharingservice/Contents/MacOS  <comment160689> What have you already tried so far to remove Airdrop functionality? <comment160694> AirDrop is 40kb file + all associated 100 kb, so total 150 kb ! a drop in a bucket for your disk. <comment160723> I've not tried to remove it. what I used this "defaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop â€‘bool YES" <comment160753> @user3171796 that would disable it not remove it. <comment161079> Thank you for your respond. What I would like to know is removing AirDrop function to keep more securely <comment161083> AFAIK once disabled on your computer it can be only turned on, on your computer, so it is safe from outsiders using it.
