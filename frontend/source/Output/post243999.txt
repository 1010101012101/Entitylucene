MacBook Pro won't turn on! <body> I was using my Macbook Pro when it turned off. The things I had plugged in at the time were a USB cable to a sound blaster thing and then into some speakers. I also had a second monitor attached, along with a wireless mouse and keyboard plug. I have tried unplugging battery, waiting 30 minutes and plugging back in. I have tried resetting SMC. I have tried leaving for about a day. I dont think the battery can drain though. I checked the battery level indicator, it showed nothing. So I left it for a day, still showed nothing. I plugged in the charger and this time it showed that I had full battery. So the battery level indicator only lit up with the charger plugged in.  Please help. It is a MacBook Pro 15" Early 2011
