Script to activate "Enter Time Machine" <body> I'm trying to get rid of the Time Machine icon in the menubar. Is there a way activate "Enter Time Machine" using a script or something along those lines? I know that we have codetmutil/code, but it can not activate the main Time Machine view to restore files from.   Thanks.  <answer141628> Just open strong/Applications/Time Machine.app/strong  <comment166895> So stupid. Thanks a lot!
