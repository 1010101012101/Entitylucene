Is there an El Capitan Update only? <body> The title is a bit confusing so I will explain below:  The El Capitan downloaded from the Apple Mac Store is embig/em enough to do a fresh installation as well as an upgrade to your current OS version.  The size of this however is very large.  h1My Question/h1  Is it possible to download just the update from OS X 10.10.5. For example to update from 10.10.4 to 10.10.5 there is an updater which is smaller than the combo update. Is there one for an update to 10.11.0/1.  emHope this makes sense/em  <answer214771> No, there isn't. El Capitan is a major release which replaces ema lot of/em (or even most) files of the OS. So the "big" Installer from the Store is both an Installer and an Updater.  <comment259386> Sulk...I guess I just have to download the huge download time <comment259387> I'm pretty sure you will still receive updates for Yosemite via App Store updates if you don't upgrade to 10.11. <comment259388> If you have a laptop, you can always go to the next Apple Retail Store and download it through the WiFi there. <comment259394> @Arc676  Yeah but I prefer to download then off Apple Website
