What application can open the .waveform file that the Voice Memos app creates? <body> I plugged an iPhone into my Ubuntu desktop and browsed the available files. In the Recordings directory I could see my voice memos, including a code.waveform/code file, which I understand contains the visual plot of the audio. What application can open this file?  <answer265120> the .waveform file looks to be a vector file to display the audio waveform on a grid. - jdio -  <comment254821> Did you google search before asking this question? <comment255054> @IronCraftMan: yes, why?
