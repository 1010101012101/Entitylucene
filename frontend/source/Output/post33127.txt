Thx  <answer35962> Open Finder, press kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdG/kbd and enter code/System/Library/QuickLook//code to go to the QuickLook plugins folder. Click on codeOffice.qlgenerator/code, press kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdI/kbd and rename the file to codeOffice.qlgenerator.backup/code. Now, press kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdesc/kbd and relaunch Finder. If ever you want to turn the plugin back on, simply remove the code.backup/code from the file name.  Essentially, plugins tell QuickLook how to render a preview of a given file type. Without the Office plugin, QuickLook will by default show only the icon and information about the file (i.e. size, date created, etc.)  Note I'm pretty sure this removes QuickLook's capabilities of previewing OpenOffice files as well.   <comment41012> Yu might also be able to edit /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator/Contents/Info.plist, and remove "stringcom.microsoft.word.doc/string" from the LSItemContentTypes array.  Note that system updates may undo either this or @rkarbowski's suggestion. <comment123251> I had the same problem. LibreOffice and OpenOffice's Quick Look Plugins were rubbish.
