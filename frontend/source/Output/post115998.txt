DiskUtility failed to make a new partition for Mavericks <body> I am running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. Yesterday I decided to upgrade to Mavericks, but I have some older programs that I use so I decided to partition my HD. My plan was to have Snow Leopard remain on the original partition and Mavericks on the new one. I wanted Mavericks on the new partition because I wanted a clean install (rather than upgrading my Snow Leopard to Mavericks on the original partition).  I have a 250GB HD, and I freed up a lot of space before trying to partition. There were about 190GB free when I tried it. I divided it, 100GB for the original and 150GB for the new partition. But when I hit start, nothing happened for about 5 minutes or so. Then a gray box popped up that said I must restart my computer.  After restarting, the computer booted up normally, but my wallpaper was back to the default for some reason. I checked DiskUtility and it only listed the original partition of 250GB. I did 'Verify Disk' and it said the drive had errors and I needed to boot from the installation disk and repair the disk. It said some numbers didn't add up, which seemed like it could be because of the missing partition.  However I couldn't find my installation disk, so I left it for the night. I put the computer to sleep, but didn't shut it down. Today I ran 'Verify Disk' again and it said "The volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK."  I have these questions:  1) Why did the partitioning fail?  2) Can I try again?  3) Should I buy a new Snow Leopard installation disk so I can run 'Repair Disk'?  4) Is my original idea ok? Can I make a new partition and install Mavericks on it? (There's a reason that I need Mavericks ASAP).
