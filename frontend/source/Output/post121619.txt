cd to directory with name of `-` <body> I'm trying to make a folder called code-/code. I know it's a silly name, it's named so to mirror something else.  precodemkdir - ls &gt; - cd - /code/pre  This makes it go up a folder or exit the symlink context depending on where I am. I found that codecd -/code means go to previous location, but can't escape it. codecd \-/code does not work.  Any way around this?  <answer121620> You can use either relative or absolute paths to prevent the - from standing alone and confusing bash's build in command codecd/code:  precodemkdir ./- cd ./- /code/pre  <answer121630>   Opposite to code~/code, which gets evaluated by bash, code-/code is an argument to codecd/code. Have a look at the man pages (well, for current systems both are in codeman bash/code as codecd/code is a builtin):   pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code   cd [-L|[-P [-e]]] [dir]           Change the current directory to dir. [...]  An argument of - is equivalent           to $OLDPWD. [...] /code/pre   And the paragraph on tilde expansion (simplified to the most common meaning):   pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeTilde Expansion    If  a  word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), [...] the tilde-prefix     is replaced with the home  directory associated with the specified login name. /code/pre   code~/code will be replaced by bash before passing the argument to the actual command. Thus, escaping it somehow (for example using code'~'/code or code\~/code) will work. code-/code on the other hand will be passed to the command. Escaping has no use: bash will not evaluate it anyway, but it will get passed unescaped as single string to codecd/code, which will subsequently open code$OLDPWD/code.  hr  A more esoteric alternative to Patrix' more reasonable way to open code-/code-folders would be to set code$OLDPATH/code to code-/code:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeOLDPATH=- cd - /code/pre  <comment141782> Nice. I realized after I posted I could go up a level and navigate back down two levels but your answer is better. <comment141909> I like the esoteric alternative :-)
