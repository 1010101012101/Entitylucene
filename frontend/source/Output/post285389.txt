Is there a way to stop inline video clips from playing on Safari? <body> My question applies to both the mobile and desktop versions of Safari, either as proper content (for example, supporting a news story) or inline video ads.  <answer285391> Found on Apple Communities : Stop auto play HTML5 in Safari?     Open Terminal and enter this command:br   codedefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1/code        That will unhide Safari's "Debug" menu.  Under that menu, go to Media   Flags, and then select Disallow Inline Video.   This will stop videos   from automatically playing when a page loads.   Just tested on Facebook - works.  <answer285392> On macOS, you can disable inline media. This can be achieved by setting the preference manually, by quitting Safari and using the following:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitMediaPlaybackAllowsInline -bool false /code/pre  supIf you are using Safari Technology Preview, replace ‘Safari’ with ‘SafariTechnologyPreview’./sup  Alternatively, you can enable the debug menu and choose the option from there.  ol liQuit Safari and enable the debug menu:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1 /code/pre/li liChoose Debug → Media Flags → Disallow Inline Video.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wGsQ9.png" alt=""/li /ol  hr  On iOS, this is not possible.  <comment359883> This has always driven me mad too - just found something to test... <comment361033> Just a note, the Debug also disables things you may want to see, such as YouTube. Took me a week to figure out why it wouldn't work, then I remembered toggling this.
