How to download old version of Mac OS X that I own and App Store lists, but App Store refuses on newer Mac <body> I own old versions of Mac OS X, emMountain Lion/em in particular. The old versions are listed in the "Purchases" list within App Store app on my Mac.   But when I hit the "Download" button a message appears strongrefusing to start the download because my MacBook Pro is too new/strong and does not support that OS.  Other Questions are similar to this but not quite the same.  ul liOthers say to use the App Store to download, but no mention of the App Store refusal that I encounter. /li liOthers suggest using developer.apple.com, but even with a paid membership that download page no longer offers old versions. The Download page offers only 2 versions: the current version (emYosemite/em) and the future beta (emEl Capitan/em)./li /ul  My goal is to install Mac OS X on a virtual machine, Parallels.  <answer197185> If you need it for an older Mac, download it on that one.   No Mac OS will install on any machine newer than the OS, as the drivers for the hardware simply didn't exist at the time.  If you fake it by installing on an older machine then swapping drives, it will just fail to start up.  <answer197218> If you go to developer.apple.com/downloads you will find all downloads that Apple has available.  Limit your search to the "OS X" category and you'll see downloads for all versions of OS X from version strong10.3 to 10.6/strong.   I'm guessing that strong10.7 and up are missing/strong because starting with 10.7, the OS was only available via the App store. Unfortunately, that means that you'll only be able to get the installer from the App store, and the only way I know of getting older version from the App store is if you have previously "purchased" that version and wish to download it again.   <answer237780> FOUND IT!  Hope this is what you were looking for -- er, a year later. Better late than never.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mountain_Lion  (can also do same with other OSX versions)  Scroll down to a chart that has the diff updates/combo updates, and on the far right column, there are links to download the each one.  Hope this helps someone!  <answer253271> Solved for me by logging out of app store then, on log in, having to sign a new user agreement.  Apps dowloaded as normal afterwards, both el capitan and mavericks.  <answer256985> Go to the codePurchased/code tab in the Mac codeApp Store/code, you can redownload previously purchased macOS versions there (even if they are older than the currently installed one).  <comment235747> Not directly relevant, but my motivation is to install the older OS into a virtual machine (Parallels) for developing and testing software. Apple does not make this easy. Ironically, Microsoft makes this testing chore super easy by [providing pre-configured virtual machine files](http://dev.modern.ie/tools/vms/mac/) ready to run in Parallels/VirtualBox/Fusion for a variety of current and older versions of Windows ( XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 ) at no cost. <comment235749> I'm trying to install the older Mac OS X versions into a virtual machine (Parallels, VirtualBox, Fusion). <comment235750> This Answer is indeed the only option I've found. I tracked down a friend with an older Mac, used the *Guest* user account to log into my Apple App Store account, then used App Store app to download the ≈ 5 gig file for the *Mountain Lion* installer app. I also had to provide the borrowed Mac’s admin user name and password because I was downloading an OS installer. The installer auto-launches, but you can quit the installer before it does anything. <comment235779> Ah, it wasn't obvious from your question that you were trying to virtualise - which would have changed the tone of my answer, but not the actual content. I don't have a paid developer account, so @user128998 's answer would not be one open to me. <comment236076> When I filter [that list](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) for "os x mountain lion" I get no offers to download the entire OS installer. I see five downloads for updates not original installers. <comment236461> I looked through the list and found base installers for all OS versions up to 10.6.  However, like you, I could not find base installers for 10.7 and later.  I'm guessing that is because starting with 10.7, the OS was only available via the App store.  Unfortunately, that means that you'll only be able to get the installer from the App store, and the only way I know of getting older version from the App store is if you have previously "purchased" that version and wish to download it again. <comment293939> you need to have actual builds though, you cant install with simple updates can you ? <comment306197> since the dmgs for the updates are in the 1G size range, I'd say no - it's not a complete installer. <comment325692> The problem here is that a 2013 MacBookAir will refuse to download a 2010 OS X Lion from the Mac App Store. <comment325693> well, it worked for me downloading "El Capitan" on my 2011 MacBook Air even if it had Sierra installed already... <comment326539> mb21, please note that El Capitan was released post-2011. If your device is released in the year 2012, you can download the OSX that was current back then, i.e. Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan, macOS Sierra. But you can't download Lion, Snow Leopard etc. Not that Snow Leopard is available on the Mac App Store, but ykwim. <comment326548> @esaruoho the versions of macOS that were released before certain hardware simply don't have the drivers for that hardware. so you'll never be able to run them on that hardware...
