Can an iPad get a form of keylogger installed by someone phishing <body> I mistakenly gave my phone number and email address in a pop up window, and I am now worried that it may have installed either spywhere or some form of keylogger onto my iPad.  Is this possible?  <comment321710> No. not unless you've jailbroken your iPad.
