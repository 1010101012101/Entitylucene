Mac play not added to path <body> I have installed the play framework using codetypesafe-activator/code. However, this does not appear on in PATH. Therefore, I can not use Play from the command line:  precodeOctavians-MBP:exericsePS octavian$ play new app -bash: play: command not found /code/pre  If I try to install play using brew I get:  precodeOctavians-MBP:exericsePS brew install play Error: No available formula for play Play 2.3 replaces the play command with activator:   brew install typesafe-activator  You can read more about this change at:   https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Migration23   https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Highlights23 /code/pre  However, I can not install it with typesafe-activator either:  precodeOctavians-MBP:exericsePS octavian$ brew install typesafe-activator Warning: typesafe-activator-1.3.5 already installed Warning: You are using OS X 10.11. We do not provide support for this pre-release version. You may encounter build failures or other breakage. Octavians-MBP:exericsePS octavian$ play help -bash: play: command not found /code/pre  So how can I install Play such that it's visible from the command line?  <answer216672> Just add path to the play installation to your code.bash_profile/code file in the user root directory.   For example I have   precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:/Users/currentuser/PlayProjects/activator:$PATH" /code/pre  This discussion could help you as well:  https://superuser.com/questions/314852/how-to-install-the-play-framework-on-os-x
