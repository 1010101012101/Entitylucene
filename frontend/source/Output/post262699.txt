Text Services Keep Losing Their Keyboard Shortcuts in Mac OS Sierra <body> I keep having the repeated problem of the strongMac text services losing the keyboard shortcuts/strong that I assign to them (in System Preferences  Keyboard Pane  Shortcuts  Services), ever since upgrading to Mac OS 10.12 Sierra.  I have a large set of strongAutomator workflow text services/strong that I use, and I assign strongkeyboard shortcuts/strong to each of these text services for speed of access. For example, I've set up a workflow that inputs the current text selection, and uses that to search eBay. My keyboard shortcut for this text service is Ctrl-Command E.   However, every now and then, all the keyboard shortcuts I assign in the System Preferences simply disappear (except for the default shortcuts, which remain).  This is very annoying, because it takes a while to re-enter all the shortcuts again, and I keep having to do this, as they keep disappearing. Often they will disappear after I have added a new keyboard shortcut to a service.  Is anyone else having this problem, and are there any workarounds for this issue? This glitch never occurred before, until I upgraded to Sierra.  Does anyone know where the file containing the assigned keyboard shortcuts is located? At least if I could take a copy of this file, it would be easier for me to restore the keyboard shortcuts after they are mysteriously deleted.  By the way, I don't have iCloud switched on (I understand that keyboard shortcuts sync over iCloud, when iCloud is on).
