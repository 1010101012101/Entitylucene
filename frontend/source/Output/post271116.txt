How to fix an accidentally created Apple CoreStorage Volume, LVG, Logical Volume Group (broken partitions) <body> I used Unetbootin and accidentally chose a partition on my HDD to install the Lubuntu Live-USB I wanted to create on an USB Stick.  Now, my HDD looks like this   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hZSQD.png" alt="iMac HD"  I can boot into Mac OS X and everything works fine.   This is a 4TB SHDD. Is there any option to recreate the original settings with only one partition?  GPT fdisk (stronggdisk/strong) shows the following:  precodeWarning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded!

[David Anderson](https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/107222/david-anderson) probably provided an answer to your question already. I don't find the duplicate though. <comment340924> The answer helped. I deleted the LVG. But i cannot resize the disk0s2.  Maximum size is I as current size. I suspect it is because the Recovery partition is in the way. I was able to do it via disk utility, though. <comment340925> @Ben It's usually possible to resize a HFS partition and a subsequent Recovery partition. It's not possible to resize 3 partition at once (e.g. hfs+recovery+ntfs - free space). A resize may also fail after modifying the partition layout with Boot Camp. <comment340926> BTW you didn't create a Linux LVM (UUID: E6D6D379-F507-44C2-A23C-238F2A3DF928) but a Apple CoreStorage LVG (UUID: 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC) <comment340978> Is this the same system as http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/271092/how-to-use-gdisk-to-fix-a-dual-boot-when-windows-is-not-booting ? <comment340990> No. The other one is a Laptop with a currently unbootable Windows partition. This one here was an iMac where Unetbootin went the wrong way. <comment341061> After using this answer my recovery partition was broken and I had to remove it. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/271254/can-i-savely-remove-a-broken-recovery-partition <comment341062> @Ben The commands in my answer shouldn't touch the Recovery HD! <comment341065> @Ben Hmm, `diskutil resizeVolume ....` usually considers the integrity of the EFI, the RecHD and the two gpts. So resizing to 100% doesn't really resize to 100% but to size_of_disk-40 blocks(1stGPT 4096 aligned)-409600 blocks (EFI)-1269536 blocks(RecHD)-40 blocks(2ndGPT 4096 aligned) <comment341066> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/52906/discussion-between-ben-and-klanomath).
