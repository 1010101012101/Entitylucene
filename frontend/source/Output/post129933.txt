Sending specific keys when using Remote Desktop UNIX commands <body> I would like to script the uninstallation and reinstallation of Profiles on a group of Networked Macs. In order to do this I shall use the UNIX Command part of Remote Desktop.  When sending the   precodeprofiles -D /code/pre  Command, it responds with   precodeAre you sure you want to delete all configuration profiles? [y/n]: /code/pre  but I have no way of pressing the Y key.  Any ideas?  <answer130018> Checking the codeprofiles/code man page, the code-f/code flag will:  emAutomatically confirm any questions, or when used with -s, will retry startup profiles at each startup until successfully installed./em  So, my guess is codeprofiles -Df/code is what you're looking for.  <comment152250> Guesswork, hence comment not answer, but what other parameters other than `-D` can you send? Is there a `-Y` for example? <comment152278> Can't believe I didn't see that myself! Thanks <comment152279> Yeah I tried that, but it seems -f does the trick! <comment338974> You can pipe yes to the command as well... = `$ yes | profiles -D`
