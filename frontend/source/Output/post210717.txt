Bootcamp no longer able to boot to OS X <body> I have a Macbook Pro 2014 with a Boot Camp partition for Windows 10. I decided to create a partition for data. I created and re-sized the partition in Disk Utility (OS X) but formatted it using a Windows tool, then all the boot options disappeared except for Windows.   The OSX partitions still show up as drives but it no longer shows as a boot option.      Using a ubuntu live disk I was able to get this information:  precode~$ sudo parted -l Model: ATA APPLE SSD SM0512 (scsi) Disk /dev/sda: 500GB Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B Partition Table: gpt  Number  Start   End    Size   File system  Name                          Flags  1      20.5kB  210MB  210MB  fat32        EFI System Partition          boot  2      210MB   141GB  141GB  hfs+         OSX                           msftdata  3      141GB   142GB  134MB               Microsoft reserved partition  4      142GB   298GB  156GB  ntfs         NTFS                          msftdata  5      298GB   298GB  472MB  ntfs                                       hidden, diag  6      298GB   299GB  650MB  hfs+         Recovery HD                   msftdata  7      299GB   500GB  201GB  ntfs         Basic data partition          msftdata   Model: Kingston DT 101 G2 (scsi) Disk /dev/sdc: 7803MB Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B Partition Table: msdos  Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags  1      4129kB  7803MB  7799MB  primary  fat32        boot, lba /code/pre  How do I get my computer to boot OS X again?   <comment254345> According to this [link](http://askubuntu.com/questions/371487/is-it-safe-to-format-msftres-msftdata-and-hidden-partitions), you have the wrong partition type GUID for partitions 2 and 6. I an not familiar with the `parted` command. So it would be difficult for me to post an answer.  Is the command `gdisk` available on the Ubuntu live disk? <comment254788> Yes gdisk is on ubuntu live disk and I was able to use it to fix the issue with help from http://superuser.com/questions/985783
