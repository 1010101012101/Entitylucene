How to make Mobile Safari open email links in the Gmail app? <body> Is it possible to make a mobile Safari open email links directly to the native Gmail app, rather than open up to Apple's Mail.app?  <answer86085> There is no way (yet) to change that without jailbreak tweak. Apple forces you to use Safari and (in this case also) Mail.app.  You can find the tweak here: http://www.webpronews.com/jailbreak-tweak-lets-you-make-chrome-your-default-ios-browser-2012-06  <comment99348> You mean, Apple forces you to use their mail app.
