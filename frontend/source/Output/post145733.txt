Weird bug with exiftool and Hazel photo workflow <body> I have a weird bug I'm experiencing. I have a folder of images that Hazel doesn't recognize as images. These are located in a folder that I have set to be monitored by Hazel using a script made with codeexiftool/code that will organize the photos into folders by year/month/day. The codeexiftool/code script follows and works for "normal" images.   precodeexiftool "-Directory&lt;DateTimeOriginal" -d %Y/%m/%d%%-c "/Volumes/VolumeName/Photos" /code/pre  Oddly enough, codeexiftool/code doesn't recognize these photos as well, even if I run the script from the command line. What's even more frustrating is that the workflow will work for some photos and not for others.   Some observations:  ul liFinder recognizes these trouble files as photos when I do a Spotlight search using the terms codekind:image/code./li liHazel does strongnot/strong treat the trouble files as images. I know this because I can set a rule to move all files but images to a different folder and those troublesome files will be moved./li liIt doesn't appear to be a permissions issue/li liIt doesn't seem to have anything to do with the format of the photo (jpg, jpeg, JPG, png, NEF)/li /ul  strongIn short, both Hazel and the codeexiftool/code script work but not for certain photos I have (and thousands of them at that!)/strong  ol liDo you have any idea what's going on and why these photos aren't being properly recognized as such?/li liHow do Hazel and codeexiftool/code differ from Finder in their determination of whether or not a file is an image?/li /ol  <comment171774> What does `file troubled-file.png` return? Does it differ from the result of `file untroubled-file.png`? <comment172080> The working file will give: `2014-04-19 at 16-35-38.jpeg: JPEG image data, EXIF standard 2.21`  Some, but not all, trouble files will give: `2014-09-02 at 13-26-06.jpg: JPEG image data`. The other trouble files will give something similar to the working files, as above.
