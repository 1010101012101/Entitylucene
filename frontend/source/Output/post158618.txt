Can I use an iPhone 4S USB power adapter with an iPhone 5S? <body> I have an iPhone 4S, and I am thinking about upgrading to an iPhone 5S.  I know that the iPhone 5S has the new Lightning connector, so I will have to get new cables.  But what about the USB power adapter?  Can I use the iPhone 4S USB power adapter with the iPhone 5S?  I found an Apple page that discusses their iPhone 4S USB power adapter, and they do not mention the iPhone 5S, so I'm not sure if it is compatible with the iPhone 5S:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXtVX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer158621> yes, they are both 5w chargers.  <answer158668> The Apple Store has more information on the USB Power Adapter.  It says it is compatible with all iPhone models, from the original iPhone all the way through the iPhone 6 Plus.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvHqw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment186474> If you purchase a new or refurbished iPhone 5S from Apple, it will come with a charger, Lightning cable, and ear-buds. <comment186512> That's one ugly little box of a charger, compared to the UK oneâ€¦ just saying, feel free to delete ;) http://i.imgur.com/BUppeOh.png
