Encrypted sparsebundle password appears to be cached <body> I use this command to mount an encrypted volume:  precodehdiutil mount ~/Documents/secret.sparsebundle/ /code/pre  On first use I'm prompted for a password. I then close it either by clicking 'eject' in finder or the matching codehdiutil unmount/code command.  If I try and re-open it using the original command, I'm sometimes granted access without the password challenge. This appears to occur across terminal sessions and (overnight) screen locks.   Is this expected behaviour or a bug? How do I ensure that the passwords are not cached?  <answer230580> From the codehdiutil/code man page:  precodeunmount volume [-force]             unmount a mounted volume without detaching any associated             image.  Volume is a /dev entry or mountpoint.  NOTE: unmount             does NOT detach any disk image associated with the volume.             Images are attached and detached; volumes are mounted and             unmounted.  hdiutil mountvol (or diskutil mount) will remount             a volume that has been unmounted by hdiutil unmount. /code/pre  The image encryption key isn't discarded until the image is detached, so after codehdiutil unmount/code you'll be able to remount it without supplying the password. Solution: use codehdiutil detach/code (or the eject button in Finder) instead.  <comment281440> I've had a look in my keychain and there's no mention of it there. The Mac is only a week old and is pretty close to a fresh install so it was easy going through all the entries. <comment281444> Thank you! I wasn't aware of detach. There was a fundamental gap in my understanding!
