I can't write to my flash drive, and it is already in the MS-DOS (FAT) Format. Why? <body> This is my first question on this website. I am using a Mac Air, and I have a flash drive in which I can read from. I am able to copy files from this onto my Desktop, or anywhere on my computer for that matter. I cannot write to my flash drive, however. I know this is a common problem for some people. I looked into their solutions. There is one difference between the cases I've found, and my case. The flash drive's format is normally a 'NT' format, which is a Window format from my understanding.  My flash drive is formatted in 'MS-DOS (FAT)' according to Disk Utility and the 'Get Info' window from Finder. It did tell me I had removed it wrongly before. I am not sure how to fix the flash drive. Do I reformat it? If so, how and what do I format it to. Please let me know.  Thank you in advance for your help,   ~Rane  Screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hspWr.png" alt="Here is the &#39;Get Info&#39; Screenshot"  I do have the flash drive selected in the Disk Utility picture.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RR3ip.png" alt="Here is a screenshot of the Disk Utility."  <answer148880> If you want to use on Mac and Windows - Select the USB drive in the left hand pane.  From the right hand side, choose Partition, change layout to 1, and format to ExFat, and see if that helps.    <answer148887> If you don't need to use this USB disk on a Windows machine, format using Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Should you need to exchange files with Windows machines, then Format as you have with MS-DOS (FAT). ExFAT should work as well.  It is not outside the bounds of possibility that the drive itself has gotten zapped somehow and is damaged, thus not operating correctly. Copy all the files from the flash drive to a folder, reformat with MS-DOS (FAT), then see what happens when you copy back. If it doesn't work, chuck it. Since flash drives are so inexpensive now, get a few more of them in larger capacities.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/51IiN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Lastly, (above) some flashdrives have a physical write-lock (read-only) hardware switch. If your flash drive has such a switch, perhaps it is locked? OS X does not allow the usual file &amp; directory permission on MS-DOS (FAT) disks, so you can't try to make it read/write.   There is also a 4GB limit on a single file in MS-DOS (FAT).  <answer148896> Going out on a limb here:  How many files are on the drive? FAT32 has a maximum number of files per volume. Assuming that the drive is formatted with 32KB clusters, only 268,173,300 files can reside on a FAT32 drive at once. Is the 1.09GB comprised of just under 268,173,300 small files?   Additionally, as IconDaemon mentioned briefly, FAT32 has a file size limit of 4GB with large file size support and 2GB without. How big is the file that you are copying to the drive?  FAT32 Wikipedia page  <answer148950> This is a stab in the dark, but is your USB drive actually an SD card in a card reader? In this case, I would tend to think the hardware write lock switch is in the on position on the SD card.  <answer213162> Sticky tape over the lock switch - sm sq, ~15 mm, diagonally, not over card contacts.  <answer245981> Formatting is sure an a option, but what if that flash drive is not yours or you have info on it? IMO, the best possible way is to download something like Paragon NTFS for Mac. Had the same problem, downloaded, installed, no more problems, easy life.   <comment175367> Is the drive in NTFS format which is NT's normal format or FAT which is MSDOS (or exFAT)? <comment175378> @Mark the screenshot and question body show that it is formatted in MS-DOS/FAT32. <comment175379> The OP says There is one difference between the cases I've found, and my case. The flash drive's format is normally a 'NT' format, - as I would expect most cases on the web re USB sticks to be FAT format this implies there is something else
