Menu bar icon disappear <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TIeAT.png" alt="menubar"  A few days ago, when I start my OS X, I see that a few key icons are gone: including the clock, WIFI, battery and various other things.   I did the following:  ol liRemove the file code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist/code/li lirun codekillall SystemUIServer/code in the terminal./li /ol  The icons did come back. strongHowever after restart the icons are gone again./strong  hr  Other symptoms include: whenever I connect to my WIFI, and then open any application, they will get shutdown immediately, giving error messages like:      Please run the gather_files.sh command that's attached to the radarbr   sudo gather_files.sh   These disappears after a day, but the icons are still gone. How can I get those icons back?  I am using OS X Mavericks 10.9.2  <answer163205> This worked for me:  ol liReboot and hold shift key to enter safe mode/li liLaunch Safari/li liReboot normally/li /ol
