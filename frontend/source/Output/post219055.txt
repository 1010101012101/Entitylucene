Apple Music filling iPhone with everything <body> Just turned on Apple Music on my Mac (not that Apple has relaxed the 25,000 song limit). After doing so I notice my iPhone getting hot and where I once had ~60 GB of free space, now I'm getting warnings that I'm running out of available space.  Looking at iTunes on the phone I see "Downloading 8,322 songs".   Also getting a bunch of 'unable to purchase' warnings every time I unlock the phone for songs purchased long ago.  I DO NOT want ALL these songs to transfer over to all my devices. It'd be nice to be able to download a song or playlist on the fly but I certainly don't expect EVERYTHING to transfer.  My iPhone is losing about 2% of battery a minute while this is going on.  iOS 9.2 on iPhone 6
