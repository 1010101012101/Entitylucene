iTunes store not loading <body> I have had this problem for about one month with my itunes store. I get a blank white screen. Tried upgrading to latest version (11.0.4 now) but nothing seems to be working.  Here's the screenshot img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRPYp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer103763> In order to get it working, I installed all my updates one at a time (instead of all at once since I was having a problem with updates installation).  <answer103978> Are you using Snow Leopard? Update the Safari then it will show.  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1569  <comment116164> Are you able to access the iTunes store through a web browser? i.e. try this link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/candy-crush-saga/id553834731 <comment116211> Yes tubedogg, itunes links are loading in browser. Thanks <comment116311> Anyone knows why this happens? I still haven't figured out a solution to this one.
