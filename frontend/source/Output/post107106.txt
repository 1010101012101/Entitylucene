User input assigned to variable in AppleScript then passed to "do shell script" command <body> How do I grab input from the user in AppleScript and then pass the result of the variable to a codedo shell script/code command from within AppleScript itself?  For example, the user would type the answer codefoo/code to the following dialog box:  precodedisplay dialog "Please enter your username" default answer "" set the userID to the text returned of the result do shell script "rm -rf /Users/$userID/.Trash/*" with administrator privileges /code/pre  So in this instance, if I were to incorporate the answer of codefoo/code in lieu of code$userID/code, it would read as the following when it executes the command:  precodedisplay dialog "Please enter your username" default answer "" set the userID to the text returned of the result do shell script "rm -rf /Users/foo/.Trash/*" with administrator privileges /code/pre  How do I pass that variable I grabbed earlier, in this case it would be $userID and incorporate it into the middle of the codeshell script/code call that I have made just above.  <answer107109> This assigns the name entered to the variable codeanswer/code.  precodedisplay dialog "What's your name?" default answer "" set answer to text returned of result display dialog "Your name is " &amp; answer /code/pre  <answer107215> You need string concatenation (the code&amp;/code operator) to combine the “fixed” parts of you string with the variable part. You also should use the codequoted form of/code command to make sure that all user inputs are handled safely (i.e. spaces, wildcards, quote characters, and other characters that the shell treats specially—none of these are likely in a “short user name” but it always a good idea to handled things safely):  precodedisplay dialog "Please enter your username" default answer "" set the userID to the text returned of the result do shell script "rm -rf /Users/"&amp; quoted form of userID &amp; "/.Trash/*" with administrator privileges /code/pre  You can also pass the rest of the pathname through codequoted form of/code, but you must not include the wildcard:  precode… "rm -rf " &amp; quoted form of ("/Users/"&amp; userID &amp; "/.Trash/") &amp; "*" … /code/pre  <comment125710> I know how to do that. I'll re-word my question to provide more clarity. <comment125711> I don't want to add answer to a dialog as text, I want to pass, pipe, parse - whichever - it into the middle of a do shell script command <comment125730> Instead of `display dialog` you put the command you need. The user input is stored in a variable. It seems you are actually asking how to concatenate strings. This is done with the `&` operator as shown in the last line of the example. <comment125757> I used your script answer to answer my own question using it to do this. Thank you.  display dialog "Your name is " & answer & ", how are you?"
