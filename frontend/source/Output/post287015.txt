Windows shortcut support for macOS Sierra <body> I recently have to work with both a mac and a windows pc. Because I have worked my whole life with PC, I'm used to work with default Windows / Unix shortcuts. So I'm trying to get these shortcuts running on macOS, because I'm obviously too dumb for switching my typing behaviour between both systems.  My main focus are following shortcuts: Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-A, Pos1, End, Ctrl-left arrow, Ctrl-right arrow  I found the great software called "Karabiner" which should support all of these shortcuts. Unfortunately it is not working on macOS Sierra  and the new "Karabiner Elements" does not support all functions i would need.  Does anyone know a good replacement for "Karabiner"? Or any other way to get the Windows shortcuts running on macOS Sierra?  <comment362264> Honestly, you will be better off long-term learning the difference rather than trying to force the Mac to behave like Windows. I've been working cross-platform for 25 years & I've found no better system than *'just work with it, not against it'.* <comment362270> Totally agree with @Tetsujin here.  I came from Windows (on the Desktop, UNIX on the server) background and I still use 3 platforms (Mac, Windows, BSD) almost daily.  After a little while, you easily switch from Windows to Mac shortcuts and vice-versa.
