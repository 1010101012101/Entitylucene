Apple mail sending duplicate messages <body> I own an Early 2011 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9.1. I have configured two email accounts with my mail app(one hotmail and another gmail), and both use imap. The problem is that when I send an email to a particular person, the app sends two mails(one duplicate) in place of one. Please help.  EDIT: Upon some troubleshooting I found that this is a problem only with hotmail, my gmail account is working fine.  EDIT: It has fixed by itself. All I can surmise is that there was a problem with the hotmail imap.  <comment140220> Is it sending it from both accounts ? <comment140227> @Buscarì›ƒ nope. two mails from the same account to same recepient. <comment140234> Is the message stuck in the Concepts folder first and you manually send it again? <comment140252> @Robuust nope. I click the send button only once. <comment140259> Only to one user? Does it show sent twice or does the person receive them twice? <comment140275> How do you know it sends 2 emails at same time. <comment140285> It shows sent twice and the person receives it twice too. I've checked it.
