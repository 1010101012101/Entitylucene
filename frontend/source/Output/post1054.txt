Keyboard shortcut for accessing address bar in Firefox <body> I am trying to kbdAlt/kbd+kbdD/kbd on my Mac, but it doesn't take me to the address bar. Instead, the key seems to insert a random character. Is there an alternative shortcut?  <answer1061> kbdCmd/kbd+kbdL/kbd a.k.a. kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdL/kbd does the trick.  <comment12128> See also: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11573/chrome-keyboard-shortcut-to-go-to-address-bar
