MacPro 10.7.5 OSX Drive cloning <body> 2009 Macpro (3,1 Quadcore)   I have an internal 2007 WD 750 Gb system drive with OSX 10.7.5 only on. How do I get that system OS with all my settings on to a new drive as I think its safer to change it before I have to (know what I mean).  I have just bought a 4Tb WD red to add to the drivebay.
