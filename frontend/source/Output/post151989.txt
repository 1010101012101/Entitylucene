Mac OS X Messages and Facetime Started Failing <body> Couple of months ago sending messages and making FaceTime calls started to fail from my Mac. I never found the energy to look into this but after upgrading to Yosemite and still seeing the failures I gave up and spent some time on this.  They both started failing at the same time so I think they are somehow connected. I've gone through most of the solutions that the interwebs offer like resetting my timezone and cleaning up the ~/Library/Messages.  Today I checked the message from console as what happens when I try to send a message or initiate a Facetime call.  When I try a FaceTime call then it fails immediately and I see this in the log  codeFaceTime(10788) deny mach-lookup com.apple.awdd/code  The full log is at https://gist.github.com/toomasr/1a92803e630f34eb4fb3  And when I try to send a message I get a red exclamation mark immediately (in less than a second) and see the lines in the log  precode21/10/14 14:40:35,703 imagent[240]: [Warning] Request to send message: IMMessageItem[outgoing: YES sender=(null); service=iMessage; handle=secretEmailAddressThatIChanged@gmail.com; unformatted=(null); country=(null); roomName='(null)'; flags=100005; subject='&lt;&lt; Message Not Loggable &gt;&gt;' text='&lt;&lt; Message Not Loggable &gt;&gt;' messageID: 47 GUID:'F563CCF5-3A9C-4C89-9F8F-167D0131949E' date:'435584435.000000' date-delivered:'0.000000' date-read:'0.000000' date-played:'0.000000' transfer guids: '(null)' empty: NO finished: YES sent: NO read: NO delivered: NO audio: NO played: NO from-me: YES DD results: NO DD Scanned: YES Downgraded: NO emote: NO expirable: NO expire-state: 0 error: 0] to chat: IMDChat: 0x7fed82c76520 GUID: iMessage;-;secretEmailAddressThatIChanged@gmail.com Style: - State: 3 Participants: (     "[IMDHandle: &lt;secretEmailAddressThatIChanged@gmail.com:(null):(null)&gt;]" )  Room Name: (null)  Display Name: (null)  Identifier: secretEmailAddressThatIChanged@gmail.com  Unread count: 0  Row ID: 3  Group ID: 9B5305DB-4938-49A0-9129-F3313E82B731  from NIL ID  fromAccount: IDSAccount: 0x7fed82d216e0 [Service: com.apple.madrid  User: myEmailAddress@gmail.com  ID: B7B7962F-E5DE-4991-BB89-F4498794132A  Type: Apple ID  Active: YES  Registration Status: Registered] /code/pre  Not sure how to move on with this. Any ideas are welcome!  <answer157646> The best answer so far (weeks after the problem) was at https://discussions.apple.com/message/27149499#27149499 The gist of it is a corrupt keychain. I'll copy paste the steps for a fix here but I advise to read the actual thread over at Apple Discussions and have backups.  Here are the steps:  ol liOpen Key Chain Access/li liSelect Login at the top left side/li liSelect All Items on the lower left side/li liSearch for entries of IDS./li liHighlight and delete all entries that has IDS. (For me I am going to need to re-install my RSA SecurID Software Token)/li liSearch for entries of FaceTime/li liHighlight and delete all entries of FaceTime/li liSearch for entries of Messages/li liHighlight and delete all entries of Messages/li /ol  I hope this helps.  <comment180765> I also asked the question (well, half of it) at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6619330 I see that there is another person with same problem at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6626317
