Is there a single user mode or safe mode on a Mac? <body> Is there any single user mode or safe mode on a Mac? I'm using 10.10 (Yosemite).  I want my Mac not to load some plists in the codeLaunchDaemons/code directory and some kext files.  <answer197777> If you don't want to load some items that usually start on bootup or login, you can startup your machine in strongsafe mode/strong. From Apple document HT201262:     Follow these steps to start up into safe mode.      ol   liStart or restart your Mac. /li   liImmediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the Shift key./li   liRelease the Shift key when you see the Apple logo appear on the screen./li   /ol   If that doesn't prevent your startup items from loading (which it won't if they're kernel extensions), you can boot in strongsingle user mode/strong. To do that, hold down kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbds/kbd while your machine is booting. You will find your machine boots to a console prompt rather than the graphical interface. Once there, you can move the kext files out the way, etc. Once you're done, type codereboot/code to restart in multi-user mode (and your machine will again boot to the graphical interface). You can find out more about single user mode in  Apple document HT201573.
