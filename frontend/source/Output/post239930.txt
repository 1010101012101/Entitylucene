Minimum volume size to enable versioning <body> I have certain documents stored on a password protected disk image stored on Dropbox. Since the documents are small text documents, I made the image small (100 MB). But now I'm getting the following message when I save a document:     The document “foo.tex” is on a volume that is too small to support   permanent version storage.      You will not be able to access older versions of this document once   you close it.   I have another 2 GB image which doesn't give rise to this warning.  So my question is, what's the minimum volume size I should use to avoid this warning?  <answer276006> For others looking for an answer, it's 600 MB or larger (599 fails, 600 succeeds). Using a sparse disk helps save space from using a "too large" volume, FWIW.  <comment325363> I have this question too.  Nobody?
