Color on my LG monitor is not as same as my MacBook Pro Retina <body> I recently bought an LG curved monitor 34UC97-S as my external monitor. However, when connected to the MacBook Pro, the color is a little weird! Slightly yellowish. I have a Spyder5Elite colorimeter. However, after I calibrated my LG monitor, it's still yellowish.  How can I fix the color on the external monitor? Or, how can I get a better colour profile on my MacBook Pro?  I need both displays to have an identical color profile.  <comment259197> The obvious one first… ;-) Have you calibrated both to the same white point? Have you tried the monitor in different 'base' states. Monitors usually have different settings for 'easy' setup "Standard, gaming, sRGB etc', some of which just seem to fight your calibration. Try one of the other presets or see if you can find a 'flat' one. <comment259199> Thank you! 6500K white point. This I can't miss. It has photo, reading, gaming mode. All of them not right. <comment259213> No custom/manual, sRGB or flat of any kind ? Reading the web page on it - it has "True Color Finder (S/W)" which sounds ominous; any way to switch that off? BTW, I'm assuming you are calibrating both monitors at the same time, not just assuming the original is 'correct'. <comment259219> True Color Finder (S/W) is a software on windows, not mac. I use the studio match mode to calibrate all monitor in my studio every month and each time I bought a new monitor. I use Dell u2516D before. And the color looks good. But my new lg monitor looks horrible. <comment259222> It might be time to speak to LG about it then - I'm not as fastidious as yourself & only have a ColorMunki, but I have managed to match all the various monitors here… & my TV. I've many Dells & others here, but I've never had an LG. <comment259229> Well, I'm not so fastidious. But the color is so horrible that I can't edit my photo on it.I bought it because I want a monitor to run after effect. But the color make it impossible.
