Is Thunderbolt backwards-compatible with mini-DP for both input and output? <body> How compatible or not is the new Thunderbolt connection?  If I have a MacBook Air with Thunderbolt, can I use my existing mini-video cable to connect it to a VGA overhead projector?  If I buy a new Cinema Display with Thunderbolt, can I connect my existing Mac Pro to it?  Are there special cables, convertors needed, or are there any fundamental incompatibilities?  <answer41326> Your existing Mini DisplayPort cable (VGA adaptor, etc.) emshould/em allow your Thunderbolt equipped MacBook Air to connect to a projector (assuming it worked previously with a Mini DisplayPort output) but, as with all things empresentation/em, you'll want to test the setup in advance if possible.

That being said, I agree that Apple's decision is *not* weird when viewed through the lens of Apple past. (In the olden days, Apple monitors were truly proprietary.)
