Trouble running MySQL on OS X 10.9.5 <body> So I ran over a lot of post treating of this specific problem but none of the answer seems to work for my case.  So this is the process :  I installed mysql via homebrew that lead me to this :   precodeMarjorie:~ Mawel$ brew install mysql ==&gt; Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/mysql-5.7.11.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/mysql-5.7.11.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz ==&gt; Pouring mysql-5.7.11.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz ==&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=Mawel --basedir=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11 --d Last 15 lines from /Users/Mawel/Library/Logs/Homebrew/mysql/01.mysqld: 2016-04-03 22:00:14 +0200  /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=Mawel --basedir=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11 --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp  Warning: The post-install step did not complete successfully You can try again using `brew postinstall mysql` ==&gt; Caveats We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:     mysql_secure_installation  To connect run:     mysql -uroot  A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built server starting up correctly.  To load mysql:   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:   mysql.server start /code/pre  I tried codemysql.server start/code  precodeStarting MySQL . ERROR! The server quit without updating PID file (/usr/local/var/mysql/Marjorie.local.pid). /code/pre  I looked for the file but the parent folder was empty :   precodeMarjorie:mysql Mawel$ cd /usr/local/var/mysql/ Marjorie:mysql Mawel$ ls -all total 0 drwxr-xr-x  2 Mawel  admin   68 Apr  3 22:27 . drwxr-xr-x  5 Mawel  admin  170 Apr  3 22:00 .. /code/pre  I then saw   precodeWarning: The post-install step did not complete successfully You can try again using `brew postinstall mysql` /code/pre  So I run it after giving acces right to it.  precodeMarjorie:etc Mawel$ brew postinstall mysql ==&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=Mawel --basedir=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11 --d Last 15 lines from /Users/Mawel/Library/Logs/Homebrew/mysql/01.mysqld: 2016-04-03 22:24:00 +0200  /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=Mawel --basedir=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11 --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp   READ THIS: https://git.io/brew-troubleshooting If reporting this issue please do so at (not Homebrew/brew):   https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues /code/pre  Still no changement at codemysql.server start/code  Anybody could help me pls I really don't know what to do anymore :/  As a plus : here is my.conf (should I edit it ?)  precode# For advice on how to change settings please see # http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-configuration-defaults.html  [mysqld]  # Remove leading # and set to the amount of RAM for the most important data # cache in MySQL.

First step :   precodeMarjorie:mysql Mawel$ brew uninstall mysql Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.11... (12,817 files, 440.5M) /code/pre  Then I ran codesudo find / -name mysql/code and decided to clean it all :  precode/Applications/MAMP/db/mysql /Applications/MAMP/db/mysql/mysql /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql /Applications/MAMP/Library/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.22.0/darwin-2level/auto/DBD/mysql /Applications/MAMP/Library/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.22.0/darwin-2level/DBD/mysql /Applications/MAMP/Library/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mysql /Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql find: ‘/dev/fd/3’: Not a directory find: File system loop detected; ‘/dev/fd/4’ is part of the same file system loop as ‘/dev/fd’. find: File system loop detected; ‘/dev/fd/5’ is part of the same file system loop as ‘/dev’. find: File system loop detected; ‘/dev/fd/6’ is part of the same file system loop as ‘/dev/fd’. find: ‘/dev/fd/7’: Not a directory find: ‘/dev/fd/8’: Not a directory /Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/db/mysql /Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/db/mysql/mysql /private/var/mysql /Users/Mawel/Library/Logs/Homebrew/mysql /usr/local/var/mysql /code/pre  I hard cleaned up this and finish with this :   precodeMarjorie:/ Mawel$ sudo find / -name mysql find: ‘/dev/fd/3’: Not a directory find: File system loop detected; ‘/dev/fd/4’ is part of the same file system loop as ‘/dev/fd’. find: File system loop detected; ‘/dev/fd/5’ is part of the same file system loop as ‘/dev’. find: File system loop detected; ‘/dev/fd/6’ is part of the same file system loop as ‘/dev/fd’. find: ‘/dev/fd/7’: Not a directory find: ‘/dev/fd/8’: Not a directory /code/pre  And finally I ran again codebrew install mysql/code  And same problem came up :     Warning: The post-install step did not complete successfully You can   try again using codebrew postinstall mysql/code   And same schema again.  <answer233644> The homebrew mysql install (or better: the initialization) failed. The main data dir is empty. Usually the data dir looks like this after a fresh install:  precodedrwxr-xr-x   18 user  admin  -      612  4 Apr 04:04 . drwxr-xr-x    3 user  admin  -      102  4 Apr 04:04 .. -rw-r-----    1 user  admin  -       56  4 Apr 04:04 auto.cnf -rw-------    1 user  admin  -     1680  4 Apr 04:04 ca-key.pem -rw-r--r--    1 user  admin  -     1075  4 Apr 04:04 ca.pem -rw-r--r--    1 user  admin  -     1079  4 Apr 04:04 client-cert.pem -rw-------    1 user  admin  -     1680  4 Apr 04:04 client-key.pem -rw-r-----    1 user  admin  -      407  4 Apr 04:04 ib_buffer_pool -rw-r-----    1 user  admin  - 50331648  4 Apr 04:04 ib_logfile0 -rw-r-----    1 user  admin  - 50331648  4 Apr 04:04 ib_logfile1 -rw-r-----    1 user  admin  - 12582912  4 Apr 04:04 ibdata1 drwxr-x---   77 user  admin  -     2618  4 Apr 04:04 mysql drwxr-x---   90 user  admin  -     3060  4 Apr 04:04 performance_schema -rw-------    1 user  admin  -     1680  4 Apr 04:04 private_key.pem -rw-r--r--    1 user  admin  -      452  4 Apr 04:04 public_key.pem -rw-r--r--    1 user  admin  -     1079  4 Apr 04:04 server-cert.pem -rw-------    1 user  admin  -     1680  4 Apr 04:04 server-key.pem drwxr-x---  108 user  admin  -     3672  4 Apr 04:04 sys /code/pre  So it's no wonder that codemysql.server start/code fails (or fails to stop mysql) because neither /usr/local/var/mysql/Marjorie.local.pid nor any other required file is present.  hr  Probably you have an older mysql install or an old config file somewhere or mysql is even still running. Remove any mysql related file after dumping any current database or backing up/renaming config files. Don't forget to remove old mysql StartUp items or launch daemons and/or launch agents also in ~/Library/LaunchAgents!  Uninstall Oracle MySQL: How could I remove mysql from manually installation version  Uninstall MAMP/MAMP Pro: Remove the MAMP and MAMP Pro folder   Also uninstall homebrew mysql. Then re-install homebrew mysql from scratch.  <comment285527> I checked if mysql was running it was all down; so this must be an older mysql installation running in conflict but I've erised most of it if it is not allready all of it .. Can you link me a page to help me finish it ? I did it the hard way like `rm -rf mysql*` (basically) <comment285529> Shall I remove every file find through `sudo find / -name mysql` ? Most of them are from MAMP, is there no pb removing it ? <comment285561> @Baldráni MAMP is self-containing and you can simply remove it. The homebrew mysql has to be removed with `brew uninstall mysql`. I don't recommend using `rm ... mysql*` for other older installations if you don't exactly know what you are doing. [Link uninstall Oracle mysql](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/230339/93229) <comment285566> Well I've edited my question if you can have look :) <comment285567> @Baldráni Did you also rename/move/remove any mysql plist and my.cnf? <comment285571> Yup just tried again removing them, allmost hesitating to cleaninstall this computeur <comment285578> @Baldráni Then uninstall homebrew mysql **and** homebrew and execute `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local`. Then reinstall homebrew/mysql. It may be sufficient to uninstall mysql only. <comment285581> Ok I juste completly removed homebrew and retry the installation but no differrence <comment285582> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/37911/discussion-between-klanomath-and-baldrani).
