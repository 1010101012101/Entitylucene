/opt insufficient permissions <body> After updating Mountain Lion to Mavericks xQuartz and MacPorts throws errors about insufficient permissions. (xQuartz and MacPorts are the latest version)  I noticed:  precode$ sudo mkdir /opt/tmp mkdir: /opt/tmp: Permission denied /code/pre  I am on Administrator Account.  precodesudo port install htop Error: Insufficient privileges to write to MacPorts install prefix. /code/pre  I can't even uninstall MacPorts with the command from here  precode%% sudo rm -rf \ /opt/local \ /Applications/DarwinPorts \ /Applications/MacPorts \ /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.* \ /Library/Receipts/DarwinPorts*.pkg \ /Library/Receipts/MacPorts*.pkg \ /Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup \ /Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0 \ /Library/Tcl/macports1.0 \ ~/.macports /code/pre  <comment125595> What do `ls -l /opt' and  `ls -l /opt/local' show.
