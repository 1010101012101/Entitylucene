How can I (or can I even) transfer iTunes/App store credit from one Apple ID to another? <body> How can I transfer my $0.49 on my apple ID to my family members $0.54 on her apple ID?  <answer95937> I'm sorry to say, as of this moment this is not possible!  <answer95984> Currently the option to transfer money between the accounts is not available online.  You can always call them and see if they will do it for you.  <answer96951> There is no way to transfer balances that exist on an iTunes account / Apple ID.  You can spend it down or let it sit there as a credit.  <answer104512> You can send it as a gift from one account to another. On the bottom of the App Store there is a button that says send gift, select that and fill in details and you should be able to send it.  <comment112608> There is no need to add signatures etc. at the end of answers, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior for details. <comment122971> Can you add some explanation on how to do that? <comment122987> You can gift an item (Music, App although weirdly not books), but not credit.
