Will changing an iCloud profile on iOS harm data on the previous account? <body> I share an iCloud with my mom. If I delete iCloud on my phone, and created a individual one, Will it delete her data?   <answer191799> Delete iCloud? You mean sign out I suppose. If you want a separate account without harm of data, Go to strongPreferences/strong  strongiCloud/strong and somewhere there are sync options.   Disable synchronization (possibly other features), sign out of iCloud, then create a new profile and use it on your iPhone. You might need the previous password to continue.  <comment227887> you did not delete it, you just signed out. Your mom can keep using it as long she is signed in. <comment227954> If you are going to create another icloud account then turn off the synchronization and create your new account using your apple device.
