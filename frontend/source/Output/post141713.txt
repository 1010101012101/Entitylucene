How to get max speed as FTP server? <body> We need to allow our clients to download files from our office via FTP. We have FIOS which SpeedTest shows as giving us 90mbps downstream, and 70mbps upstream.  We've tried FreeNAS; FTP speeds are terrible.  We've tried using several of our Macs, from iMac to new MacPro, with built-in FTP server, as well as codepure-ftpd/code, and we can't get more than 10mbps consistently. If we use codelftp/code with multiple threads, we get up to 40mbps for 2-3 seconds, then 0 for the next minute or two. (See FTP server keeps stopping (Mavericks))  AFP and SMB also give poor performance.  Do we need OSX Server? What is our next step? How do we maximize our FIOS capabilities?  Note: I tested connection using codeiperf/code to a public server and got 50-70 mbps upload.   <comment167028> What kind of a network setup do you have between the router and the Macs? Firewalls, NATs, IDSs? <comment167086> Pretty basic setup ... FIOS router and a gigabit switch. <comment167683> → Ze'ev: Which one of the basic setup is your network architecture? <comment167684> → Ze'ev: From the analysis "AFP and SMB also give poor performance", you have either a generic OS X problem or a generic network problem. To check your network, what is the performance of an `scp` of a 1 Gbyte file between 2 ports of your switch within the same network? <comment167726> Not sure about SCP, but FTP from one machine to another over LAN is near 1gbps
