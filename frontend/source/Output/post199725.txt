Yosemite on SSD boots from USB but not when the SSD is installed internally <body> In another thread I have explained the issues I have with a clean install of OS X on a SSD.  Now the situation is:  ul liYosemite installed on SSD./li liBoots from SSD attached via USB ./li liDoes not boot from SSD when installed internally./li liI get a beachball and the Mac will not start./li /ul  What might the problem be?  <answer199765> Just because the hardware is set to remember where the last boot was from and will look back to it at the bext boot, I can recommend you to hold down the C button right after you start up the fully assembled system and then select the SSD again.   Also note that the cable that connects the internally placed SSD may be damaged/disconnected somehow or even the Motherboard could have a problematic/defected chip.   <comment240550> The HDD cables of MacBook Pros are known to be very error-prone. You should consider replacing it. iFixit has the knowledge and parts.
