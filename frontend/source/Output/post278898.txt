How to find MinimumOSVersion of all purchased iOS apps in iTunes? <body> I have many purchased iOS apps in my iTunes on macOS. I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 7.1.2 that cannot be upgraded to any upper iOS due to lack of compatibility. Some of apps in iTunes were downloaded in my iPhone 4 and then transferred to iTunes, these apps are compatible with my iPhone 4; But other apps were downloaded directly in iTunes need minimum version of iOS greater than 7.1.2. I want to find these incompatible apps with my iPhone 4.  A naive solution is to sync all apps with my iPhone 4 and look in error message that will list incompatible apps. Is there any fast solution to find all of those apps to remove them?  <answer278899> I changed Walt Stoneburner's script that I used to answer here to list MimimumOSVersion of apps located in iTunes library. Run This script in terminal:  precodefor f in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/Mobile\ Applications/*.ipa; do     (echo "$f" ; unzip -Z1 "$f" | egrep -i ".app/Info.plist$" | \         awk '{ print length($0) " " $0; }' | sort -n | cut -d ' ' -f 2- | head -n1 | \         xargs -I file unzip -p "$f" file  | \         plutil -p - | egrep -i "\"MinimumOSVersion\"" ) | \         perl -e 'while (&lt;&gt;) { if (m!^/!) { chop; $fqn=$_; } if (m/"(.+)" =&gt; (".+")/) { $e{lc($1)}=$2; } } print "\"${fqn}\",$e{\"minimumosversion\"}\n";'; \ done /code/pre  It will list apps like this:  precode"/Users/username/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/app1.ipa","7.0" "/Users/username/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/app1.ipa","8.0" "/Users/username/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/app3.ipa","7.1" ... /code/pre  If you want the output in a file you can save the script in a file (codeminimum.sh/code for example) then run this command in the terminal:  precode$ sh minimum.sh &gt; output.csv /code/pre  Then open codeoutput.csv/code with Apple Numbers and sort the table with second column. Minimum iOS versions required are now observable.
