How to type option + insert <body> In Youtrack (issue tracker) there are shortcuts that require 'insert' key which my macbook pro 15inch 2016 model does not have. How can I emulate it? Is there a combo like fn +  that simulates insert key?  I tried everything that was suggested in other questions and answers and have not solved my problem yet.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cv2um.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer275183> My understanding is on Macs it will depend on the keyboard type. The different options I am aware of are:  ul liDo a strongfn/strong + strongreturn/strong keyboard shortcut/li liDo a strongfn/strong + strongcontrol/strong + strongreturn/strong keyboard shortcut/li liPress the stronghelp/strong key/li /ul  I do not know if any of these work on a 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard. I suppose you would have to try holding the strongoption/strong key as well as the above options to see if any work.  <comment346112> none of the above works on my keyboard <comment346114> Did you try asking the app makers what they expect you to do on Mac? <comment346121> Have you tried Option + Fn + Return? <comment346158> @hexa yes, no luck <comment347089> @SašaŠijak I'm sorry to hear that. Did you find an option that works for you?
