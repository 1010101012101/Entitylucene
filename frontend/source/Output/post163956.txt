What files do I need to remove to wipe every trace of iTunes from my Mac filesystem? <body> I would like to delete every possible file read, created or cached by iTunes on a Mac and reinstall the whole thing from scratch.  What do I need to delete? Obviously everything in code/Applications/iTunes.app/code, what else? Here are some:  ul li~/Library/iTunes/li li~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iTunes/li /ul  Also files that iTunes uses, like (I am assuming) the various sync folders and services. What other folders/files am I missing?  <answer163981> The ones I know of are:  code~/Library/iTunes//code  code/Library/iTunes//code  code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/code  code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist/code + more similar code.plist/code files  However there are probably a LOT more hidden throughout the OS. As soulshined pointed out there are parts of the OS that depend on having iTunes, and removing it would break them. I am curious as to why you need to?  <comment192072> are you using a mac? <comment192075> yep- updated question to make that clear. <comment192076> The reason I ask is because iTunes is hard coded in the operating system, much like how windows used to hard code IE into the OS. You will have to do a reinstall of the OS <comment192084> soulshined: This is not correct, I was able to remove the application and reinstall it from apple.com a few weeks ago. I wasn't thorough in deleting all files however. <comment192085> I did not say you couldn't delete it. I'm aware, it's possible, but it is still hard coded into the OS. I'm assuming you ran a sudo command? If so do you recall which one? <comment192096> Then you are using 'hard coded' wrong. It's not hard-coded if the OS can function without it. Which it can (although I would  not recommend forcing OSX apps out of the system, it can cause miscellaneous problems). I suppose you also want to remove the `~/Music/iTunes` folder with the track database and all that. <comment192114> Which parts of the OS depend on iTunes? <comment192118> Perhaps you need to explain your problem. Why do you need to 'delete every possible file'? What problem are you encountering when just reinstalling iTunes? <comment192144> Because I still haven't solved http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/162525/7087 yet and it's driving me nuts. <comment192371> Did you try a full restore yet? <comment192416> Yes. Four times iTunes has turned 25GB of music on my phone into 25GB of undeletable "Other", and I've restored the device  four times in the past week.
