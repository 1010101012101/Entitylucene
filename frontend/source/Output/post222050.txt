Can I schedule Do Not Disturb for specific days? <body> I currently have Do Not Disturb on my iPhone (iOS 9) scheduled to run while I am at college. The only issue is that I am not at college every day.   Is there a way I can schedule Do Not Disturb for certain days? (For example: Tuesday-Thursday)  <answer222052> The only way to achieve that is with a jailbreak.   <answer222053> Sadly, on a non jailbroken phone you can only set Do Not Disturb to set hours, regardless of which day.  Therefore, every day gets the same hours.  What would be nice, would be a system like the alarms where you can set multiple ones and have them repeat on choosable days, then you could set 2 DND period, one to cover weekdays, and one for weekends etc.  I would recommend making a feature request at this link.  <comment269002> I think what you are asking is not possible. Maybe an App can be designed to do that. <comment269003> Oh well. Thanks for your answer. This is what I was expecting. Unfortunately I do not want to jailbreak my device since I find there is no need to on iOS 9 and all it does is make my phone unstable, also when I want to update when jailbroken I would need to restore first. <comment366580> Please specify how this can be accomplished with a jailbroken iPhone. <comment366581> Possible duplicate of [How to customize the Do Not Disturb feature for weekends?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129733/how-to-customize-the-do-not-disturb-feature-for-weekends)
