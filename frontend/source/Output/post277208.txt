Forcing macOS Sierra L2TP client to use specific interface <body> I've got a WiFi (en0) and Ethernet (en8) connection on my machine. Each interface is on a separate network and en0 has priority over en8.  The gateway for en0 is code192.168.100.1/code and for en8 it is code172.20.10.1/code  There are services I need to access that are only available on the en0 network, and the VPN is only available via en2 network.  I want to be able to force the macOS Sierra L2TP client to use en8. I have successfully added a static route to route the IP address that I want to connect to, to the gateway of en2 and have verified by running codetrace get &lt;vpn address&gt;/code  However the connection still fails and when I look at the logs in code/var/ppp/ppp.log/code it looks like the L2TP client is still trying to go through the en0 gateway:  codeWed Mar 22 13:53:10 2017 : l2tp_get_router_address 192.168.100.1 from dict 1/code  Routing Table below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xSzCQ.png" alt="routing table"  <answer277563> Having two default gateways in macOS will result in: the gateway of the interface with the higher priority will be the default one and the other one is disregarded.  To get the order enter in Terminal: codenetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder/code.  So remove the default gateway of interface en8 and either add a custom route to the VPN server:  precodesudo route add -host &lt;VPN-server-ip-address&gt; -interface en8 /code/pre  or  precodesudo route add -host &lt;VPN-server-ip-address&gt; -link &lt;MAC-of-en8&gt; /code/pre  or to the network (here the example network: 10.0.0.0/16)  precodesudo route -n add -net 10.0.0.0/16  172.20.10.1 /code/pre  hr  Depending on the network environment of the VPN-server a second inverted route pointing to your local 172.20.10.0/28 network has to be added there.  <comment348933> Oops, I've added it in now. <comment348936> Please add the output of `netstat -f inet -r` <comment349323> @klanomath I've updated post with routing table. I'm on a new machine now and the interfaces are now en0 and en8 respectively. <comment350046> Very helpful, thanks
