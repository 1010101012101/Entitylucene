Recovering a deleted photo on iPhone <body> I have a 32GB iPhone 4 version 4.0.1. I have many photos on my phone, but I have deleted an important photo from my iPhone. How can I get this photo back from my iPhone?  <answer7979> Unless you have synced your iPhone and thus have your photo somewhere in your computer, or uploaded it to some service you can't recover it strongeasily/strong.  Most likely you don't have any copies of it and you'll have to find some professional to recover it from the iPhone memory. Maybe, and I say really just maybe, apple care support would be able to do it.  Here's one thing you could try, though: manage to get access to iPhone file system somehow (jailbreak, iPhone Explorer, anything you want) and get some file recovery software. Keep in mind emrecovering deleted files/em are complicated and strongexpensive business/strong. You'll only be able to do it this way if you get lucky.  <comment8626> Apple Care doesn't do data recovery but they may be able to recommend a place that can.
