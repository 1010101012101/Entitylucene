How do I enable SSH server on startup through Terminal? <body> Curious as to how I can enable the sshd to start on startup solely using terminal. The GUI is great and everything but it doesn't go well with my bash scripts.  <answer38146> The short answer on how to enable emsshd/em from the terminal is doing this:  precodesudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on /code/pre  The long answer on how to execute daemons or scripts on startup is a bit longer. There are two ways (that I know of) to do this:  ul liThe first one is through strongStartup Items/strong, which are executed at the final phase of bootup, these are deprecated and shouldn't be used unless you need compatibility with MacOSX v10.3 or earlier. You can take a look at how to do it this way in here./li liThe second one is stronglaunchd/strong, a replacement for eminit/em and emrc/em (among others). This is the recommended way and it's a bit trickier than just putting a script on a folder like in Linux. There are several ways to launch daemons, the preferred way it to launch them on demand (so they will be ready to launch but you won't see them in a emps/em for example, unless you are using them). The explanation is a bit lengthly and the list of options is long, you can take a look at the documentation here. You can take a look in em/Library/LaunchAgents/em for examples, if you have Chrome installed, there is a file in there for the Google Software Updater called emcom.google.keystone.agent.plist/em, that runs at load time, you can start there./li /ul
