Numbers auto date on template only <body> Is it possible to use the code=today()/code function (or something else) to insert the current date but then not update each time the file is opened?  I want to create a numbers template for my invoices. I'd like it to auto fill invoice date and date due then, when I save the document, store the values, not the function.  <answer47418> Go to Insert  Date &amp; Time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fxcf1.png" alt="Menu"  Double-click the date and format to taste. Make sure "Automatically update on open" isn't ticked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ZtEO.png" alt="Format"  <comment54322> Actually, depending on *exactly* how you plan to do this, you may want to fiddle around a bit with the Auto update setting. <comment54324> hey thanks heaps just wondering do you know why insert date & time would be greyed out? <comment54333> If don't have the cell selected and ready to type into you can't insert into it <comment54340> yeah i know that thanks must be playing up i will try areset
