Can AppleScript automatically press a key for me in an application? <body> I'm trying to devices an AppleScript that will automatically press the right arrow key for 1 second, then the left arrow key for 1 second and repeat this in an endless loop until I interrupt it.  Here is what I've come up with so far, but it's not quite working:  precodetell application "VisualBoyAdvance"     repeat 100 times         tell application "VisualBoyAdvance" to keystroke "124"         delay 1     end repeat      end tell  /code/pre  <answer91191> I just did some tests : AppleScript is not well suited for what you ask since it is Single Threaded. Therefore exiting the loop in such situation does not seem possible.   Here is a code that do what you want but without exiting the loop.   precodetell application "VisualBoyAdvance" to activate repeat while true     set mydate to current date     repeat while ((current date) - mydate &lt; 1)         tell application "System Events" to keystroke (key code 124) -- right     end repeat     repeat while ((current date) - mydate &lt; 1)         tell application "System Events" to keystroke (key code 123) -- left     end repeat end repeat /code/pre  If you run it it will freeze the computer by sending to much events.   <answer91239> You could repeat key code commands until the frontmost application changes:  precodedelay 1 activate application "TextEdit" tell application "System Events"     repeat while (path to frontmost application) is (path to application "TextEdit")         repeat 3 times             key code 123             delay 0.3         end repeat         repeat 3 times             key code 124             delay 0.3         end repeat     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Shorter delays (including 0.2 seconds) made it difficult to stop the script. I had to hold ⌥⇧⌘⎋ to force quit TextEdit.  This moved left only once:  precodedelay 1 tell application "System Events"     key down (character id 28)     delay 5     key up (character id 28) end tell /code/pre  ul lileft: 123 / 28/li liright: 124 / 29/li lidown: 125 / 31/li liup: 126 / 30/li /ul  <comment107089> Can you add a code sample of what you've tried so far? You will learn more from somebody giving feedback to your script than just from copying from somebody. <comment107092> Interesting request. What do you need it for ? <comment162545> @Buscar웃 I guess he needs it to auto-hatch his pokemon egg...! I stumbled upon this question in the quest to do the same...
