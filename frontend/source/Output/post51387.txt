Forgot password to FileVault. Still got access to the machine <body> I just realized, that few months ago I converted my disk to FileVault. I am afraid of loosing access to my data. I still have access to the machine: login, password, administrator account.  Is there something I can do to protect myself against loosing data? Like burning the key-cd in Windows?  <answer51425> The only things that can decrypt a FileVault volume are  ol lithe strongpasswords to your user accounts/strong that you gave access during FileVault setup, and/li lithe strongrecovery key/strong (24 characters) that you received (and should have written down) during FileVault setup./li /ol  If you no longer have the recovery key, and you're concerned about forgetting/losing your account password, you can go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; FileVault/code and click codeEnable Users.../code to allow more user accounts to decrypt the volume.  Alternatively, if you don't want other accounts to have that ability, you can disable and then re-enable FileVault to get a new recovery key (but that may take a long time).  <comment58747> which version of OS X? FileVault or FileVault2? <comment58765> @lupincho: OSX Lion 10.7.3 <comment58798> Wow so no problem actually, as I remember the user password. Thanks!
