App Store doesn't launch after El Capitan 10.11.1 update <body> I just installed the 10.11.1 update for Mac OS X 'El Capitan' on my late 2011 MacBook Pro.  The App Store icon is still visible in my dock, I am able to click it, but the App Store does not launch.  Is there a way to reinstall the App Store or to fix this in any way?  Update: I have tried restoring "App Store.app" through Time Machine, but the system refuses to remove or replace this file.  <answer212521> This is the kind of 'random' error I would entrust to Onyx [freeware] to tackle.  Run the Utility, supply your admin password, then allow it to run the disk check.  After it has finished, go to Maintenance &amp; the 2nd tab, Permissions. Run the perms check.  If that is not sufficient to fix it, then try the default options in the last tab, Rebuilding.br Reboot.  Navigate to code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.appstore.savedState/code &amp; delete the strongcontents/strong of that folder, not the folder itself.  sup add a comment below if it still doesn't work/sup  <comment281630> hey guy thank you, after run rebuild - reboot system, it's working
