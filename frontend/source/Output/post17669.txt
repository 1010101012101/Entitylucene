iTunes U downloads not added properly <body> I am trying to download several iTunes U lectures from Walter Lewin's 8.01 Classical Mechanics series. I "GET" all the lectures I want to queue them up overnight.  My problem is that when they all finish downloading, they don't get added properly to their corresponding iTunes U series. In this case, I should expect to find them inbr code../Music/iTunes Media/iTunes U/Physics I_ Classical Mechanics/code  Instead, they all get stuck inbr code../Music/iTunes Media/Downloads/iTunes U/&lt;lecture title&gt;.tmp/download.mp4/code  As such, in my iTunes U window, these lectures are all grayed out as though they haven't been downloaded yet.  strongAttempted solution 1/strong    ol liI rename the codedownload.mp4/code into the correct lecture title format./li liI add it to code../Music/iTunes Media/iTunes U/Physics I_ Classical Mechanics/code./li liI restart iTunes./li liIt fails. The corresponding lecture is still grayed out./li /ol  strongAttempted solution 2/strong  ol liI rename the codedownload.mp4/code into the correct lecture title format./li liI add it to code../Music/iTunes Media/Automatically Add to iTunes/code./li liInstead, the file is immediately transferred to the codeNot Added/code folder./li liIn the iTunes U window, the corresponding lecture is still grayed out./li /ol  strongAttempted solution 3/strong  ol liI try to use codeFile &gt; Add to Library.../code and choose the downloaded lecture./li liNothing happens.
