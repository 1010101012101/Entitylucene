Mac OSX and enabling user root <body> All I am running OSX 10.6.8 I have enabled root login through Directory Utility. I have assigned a password.  I get an error when I try to ssh root@localhost.  precodessh -v root@localhost  OpenSSH_5.2p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/rrazavipour-lp/.ssh/config debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: Connecting to localhost [127.0.0.1] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/rrazavipour-lp/.ssh/identity type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/rrazavipour-lp/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 debug1: identity file /Users/rrazavipour-lp/.ssh/id_dsa type 2 debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_5.2 debug1: match: OpenSSH_5.2 pat OpenSSH* debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.2 debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received debug1: kex: server-&gt;client aes128-ctr hmac-md5 none debug1: kex: client-&gt;server aes128-ctr hmac-md5 none debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST(1024&lt;1024&lt;8192) sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_INIT sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REPLY debug1: Host 'localhost' is known and matches the RSA host key. debug1: Found key in /Users/rrazavipour-lp/.ssh/known_hosts:47 debug1: ssh_rsa_verify: signature correct debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,keyboard-interactive debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering public key: /Users/rrazavipour-lp/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,keyboard-interactive debug1: Trying private key: /Users/rrazavipour-lp/.ssh/identity debug1: Offering public key: /Users/rrazavipour-lp/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,keyboard-interactive debug1: Next authentication method: keyboard-interactive Password: debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,keyboard-interactive debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,keyboard-interactive debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,keyboard-interactive debug1: No more authentication methods to try.

I know I have the password correct.  <answer54837> Root login over SSH is emnot/em enabled by default for good reason.  Since you are not connecting remotely in your example, I recommend:  precodesudo su /code/pre  to switch to root user if you need to run several commands in a row.  This keeps you from needing to do the emmuch safer/em  precodesudo commandname /code/pre  where you need to prefix every command with codesudo/code. If ssh is a requirement, you can simply:  precodessh user@host /code/pre  and then  precodesudo su /code/pre  to switch to root user. This is a much safer approach from a security standpoint.   Lastly, if you really think you must enable root login over ssh, see this link for instructions.  <comment62868> Is there a specific reason you are logging in via ssh instead of just using sudo su? <comment62918> I need to do this because I am testing/developing an NKE. <comment62920> @reza , any of these approaches should solve your problem.  I was merely cautioning against enabling remote root login. Can you explain how being logged in as root directly relates to developing and NKE? `ssh user@host` followed by `sudo su` gets you root access and its safer.
