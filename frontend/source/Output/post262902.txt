How to disassociate AppleID from an old iPhone? <body> I have given my grandson my old iPhone, but all the messages sent to my current one are still being received by that phone as well, even though it's a different number.  How can I prevent my iPhone to do so?  <answer262911> Sign out of iCloud on the iPhone.
