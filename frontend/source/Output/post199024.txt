Cannot enter password to reset keychain <body> I'm trying to reset my keychain (Yosemite 10.10.4).  ul liWhen I enter my wifi password I get "A keychain cannot be found to store my_wifi_sid"/li liI click "Reset to Defaults"/li liI get "Are you sure you want to reset your keychain? This will delete all your saved passwords, keys, and certificates. You cannot undo this operation" and click "Reset"/li liI get "Please enter your login password. This password will be used to create your new keychain." with a password field.  Attempts to type in this field interact with whatever app is in the background (browser, desktop).  I can click the "Show password" checkbox./li /ul  This issue has also been reported at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6788761.  Upgrades did not help.  Deleting keychain folders via the command line ends up with the same result (not saving passwords and the above dialog).  This started about a month ago and does not appear to be associated with any system update.  Any tips on troubleshooting, logs to look at would be appreciated.  strongUpdate/strong  tl;dr: disabling the Guest User and upgrading to El Capitan seems to have done the trick.   Not what I'd call an answer since I can't tell you which action is the fix, but here are two things,  one or both of which may have solved my problem.  I tried to log into the Guest User on this machine and learned that somehow I got a not-managed Guest User account.  This Guest User was asking for a password (which I did not know).  So I disabled the Guest User account.    Disabling the Guest User account seemed to solve this issue for some (but not all) of the users.  Next I downloaded the El Capitan installer to a thumb drive and installed it on my MacbookPro.  Now all of my keychain issues appear to be fixed.  <answer199380> I had the same problem.

So the fact that it is a wifi password may be inconsequential aside from the fact that this is something that Yosemite tries (unsuccessfully) to store in the keychain. <comment239972> Thank you @jack. That did not work for me though. <comment239997> Links rot. Please include the relevant information behind in the link in your answer.
