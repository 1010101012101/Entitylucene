How to go back to "All Artists" in iTunes <body> In iTunes, in Artists view, after I've used kbdCommand/kbd+kbdL/kbd to go to the track currently playing, how do I exit and go back to showing All Artists? I currently have to scroll to the top of the Artists list (on the sidebar) and click "All Artists" every time. Is there an easier way?  <answer174023> The only way I know short of scrolling with the mouse is, after having pressed kbdCommand/kbd-kbdL/kbd, you can press the following key sequence to get to strongAll Artists/strong: kbdTab/kbd, kbdTab/kbd, kbdA/kbd, kbd↑/kbd, kbd↑/kbd  This assumes you have an artist's name starting with the letter strongA/strong. If not, then substitute strongA/strong with the first character of the artist's name that's directly under strongCompilations/strong in the sidebar.  In other words, after having pressed kbdCommand/kbd-kbdL/kbd, pressing kbdTab/kbd twice sets focus to the now playing artist in the sidebar. If it's not the artist directly under strongCompilations/strong then pressing the appropriate key to get there plus kbd↑/kbd twice takes you back to strongAll Artists/strong.  <comment204867> Please don't put keystrokes both in the `kbd` tags as well as typing them out normally - it makes your answer harder to read and is redundant. <comment204876> @tubedogg thank you for your edits and feedback.  I have removed the `code` tags however I put back the dash between the keyboard shortcuts because that is the default method Apple uses in their documentation as in: [OS X: Keyboard shortcuts](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236)
