How to resume iCloud restore? <body> I formatted my iPhone and after setting up iCloud, my apps and pictures were downloading.   In middle due to net disconnection, it stopped and it's in stop state till now.  Apps icons are dim and lots of pictures have empty frame.   How do I start downloading/resume them again?   <answer126474> Go to  ol liSettings/li liReset/li liReset All Settings/li /ol  and the process will start over. You're strongnot losing content/strong this way, because that's the 2nd option on that page.  <comment148117> Click on one of them to check if they start downloading again. <comment148124> @Rob you might be referring to apps, but i want the pictures downloaded. <comment148126> That's not what you asked in the question. You claim both stopped to work. <comment148153> @Rob I understand the app resume, when you tap. What about the pictures?
