How to delete an email account from an iPhone 5? <body> I am trying to delete my corporate email account because it simply will not load any emails any more. The first time time this happened I deleted the account and I just re-added the email account after I just deleted it and it worked great. I am running through this problem once again and this time it does not let me delete my email. When i choose to delete it. it just freezes. What can I do to fix this problem so I can start using my email again.  <comment162449> what type of Mail Account are you talking about Gmail, Exchange, iCloud, imap, pop/smtp? without these information it is really hard to guess where it hangs up. - also have you tried to wait (how long, it may take up to 15min to remove an email account depending on your version of iOS, Email Type and Connection Speed) how did you cancel/abort the freezing just press the home button or hard reset (hold power and home together until the phone restarts)? <comment162450> Try enabling Airplane mode and removing the account.
