Inspect the content of Time Machine single backup <body> Every time I make a backup with Time Machine, the size of the data backed up is always 2Gb+.br I don't understand where all these data are coming from.br Is there a way to inspect the content of the single backup?  <answer211572> TimeTracker - this allows you to see the individual files backed up to Time Machine.  (It's a little down on the website.)  <answer295272> I guess this question is pretty old now, but just in case anyone is still looking for something, I use BackupLoupe.  <comment255411> I already tried this, but whenever I launch the app, it says it doesn't have the permission to read the backup file and becomes unresponsive. <comment255433> Are you using torrent or usenet software?  If so, open the TM settings and add the working directories pointing to these to ignore. <comment255440> @pasine I don't have that issue, it works fine for me. Are you logged in as an admin? <comment255462> yes. maybe because the TM is on a NAS? <comment274511> Same here and my TM is on a NAS too.
