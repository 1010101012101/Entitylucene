Setting up key bindings of Corsair Vengeance K70 to work with OS X <body> I recently purchased a Corsair Vengeance K70 and am trying to get set the codectrl windows alt/code keys to match the ones on a mac keyboard, codecontrol option(alt) command/code. Currently the codewindows/code key acts like codecommand/code.  So far I've tried setting the key bindings by going to codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Modifier Keys -&gt; Corsair K70R Gaming Keyboard/code and testing different configurations of key settings though this appeared to have no effect.   I also attempted switching the codeBIOS switch/code on the keyboard though that seemed to have no effect.  Any suggestions? Thanks!  strongUpdate/strong: By opening the on screen keyboard I can confirm that the problem is that the codewindows/code key is synced with the codealt/code key and codecommand/code with codewindow/code so I need a reliable way to switch those.  <answer115954> I decided to go with DoubleCommand as it seemed to fit my needs and it made it easy to switch the keys. My only complaint is that there is not a per keyboard setting so this also affects my (less used) mac keyboard. Cheers  <answer115996> KeyRemap4MacBook also supports device-specific settings:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;devicevendordef&gt;     &lt;vendorname&gt;KINESIS&lt;/vendorname&gt;     &lt;vendorid&gt;0x05f3&lt;/vendorid&gt;   &lt;/devicevendordef&gt;   &lt;deviceproductdef&gt;     &lt;productname&gt;ADVANTAGE&lt;/productname&gt;     &lt;productid&gt;0x0007&lt;/productid&gt;   &lt;/deviceproductdef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;device_only&gt;DeviceVendor::KINESIS, DeviceProduct::ADVANTAGE&lt;/device_only&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::OPTION_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::OPTION_R&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::PC_APPLICATION, KeyCode::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  I don't know the vendor or product IDs for Corsair Vengeance K70, but you can see them with EventViewer.app, which is located in code/Applications/KeyRemap4MacBook.app/Contents/Applications//code.  <answer143003> The following worked for me:  ol liOpen System Preferences -- Keyboard -- Modifier Keys/li liSelect the Corsair Vengeance K70 from the Select Keyboard pulldown list/li liSetup your mappings - for me I remapped/li liCtrl Lock to Control/li liOption to Command/li liCommand to Option  /li liClose the Keyboard System Preferences/li liRestart the computer (I believe that you can also just close the Preferences unplug the keyboard instead of restart)/li /ol  After a restart everything worked as expected on Mavericks  <comment135634> I do not have a solution but will confirm that on a "Windows" keyboard "Control" maps to "Control", "Alt" to "Alt" and "Windows" to "Command". That is the default and I have chosen to leave it like that so when I switch keyboards or computers I will be comfortable with them and not need to change settings or install extra software. <comment154778> Can you explain how you got this to work? I installed DoubleCommand and checked "Option Key acts as Command Key" and also "Command Key acts as Option Key". I clicked activate, System, (put in password), and User. Nothing changed. Then I tried all of the various options and nothing changed. <comment155034> @GhostToast With it activated try replugging in your keyboard, I've found I have to do this when switching over key assignments. <comment155152> Thanks @bipolarpants. Not to get off topic too much, but I wanted to leave this here as I know others are probably suffering same fate we were. I ended up going with KeyRemap4MacBook as it was easier to get working. There is a GUI for choosing options/keys, one does not have to manually write the XML. While it takes over *every* keyboard (including builtin keyboard on MacBook Pro), it does allow for multiple profiles, so I can easily switch back to "native" keyboard setup when I am unplugged. <comment171505> Thanks for this, I had everything here except the restart! <comment279137> Unplugging the keyboard was sufficient for me.  No need to restart the computer. <comment285941> For some reason the `Modifier Keys` dialog does not tell you to reconnect the keyboard, that is needed also :-)
