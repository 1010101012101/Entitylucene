Print at smaller scale <body> I recently received a PDF document consisting of 2 landscape A4 documents, which I would like to print as 1 portrait A4 (or 2 A5). I'm missing the control panel to print at 50% with matching layout. How can I do this on OS X?  <answer96414> You can reduce size and fit to patch size with Preview (which is the default application for PDFs). In the print dialog, select paper size and adjustments as required:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lu8xg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer96431> Thank for all your suggestions! With them, I found the following solution. A little disclaimer first: I don't have my Mac that long, and printing on a Mac was entirely new to me until last week. It can all be done without additional software on OS X 10.8.4, maybe on older version too (i don't know).  First, open the the 'Show Details' pane (i totally missed that).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjH5r.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then, open the layout sub pane (1) and change 'Pages per Sheet' (2). The printer driver automatically scaled down the pages to fit. As you can see, this is a Brother MFC-J4410DW,  so maybe your mileage differs with another printer driver.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ws6OO.png" alt="enter image description here"
