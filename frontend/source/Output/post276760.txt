MacBook OSX BootCamp Selection lags/Slow not responsive <body> OSX Boot drive selection screen is slow, un-responsive and takes forever to load in Macbook Pro (early 2015)  Recap; When switching OS in the Boo Selection, there is sometimes lag or it doesnt response at all. The SD card does not work in windows actually it treats its as a hardware error. But when I boot back to OSX, everything is working as it should.   According to the topic there, this could be a hardware error with the logic and it will need to be repair. I cannot afford to change it at this time   Anyone here with a similar issue? I don't use the SD slot much but I am just confused why everything on OSX works fine with out issues. Ive done diagnostic and verify and fixed the disk in Recovery mode and its all working.
