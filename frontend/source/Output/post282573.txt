Is there a way to change the universal keyboard shortcuts? <body> Is there a way to change any of the universal default keyboard shortcuts? I know I can make custom shortcuts in strongSystem Preferences -  Keyboard - Shortcuts/strong. But that doesn't allow you to change the universal shortcuts. For instance code⌘P/code is a universal keyboard shortcut for strongPrint/strong. But I don't have a printer which makes this shortcut useless to me. I do however, have an applescript service which creates a random password. And code⌘P/code seems like an obvious choice for a keyboard shortcut to this service. Is this possible? Maybe through Terminal?  strongSystem - El Capitan 10.11.6/strong
