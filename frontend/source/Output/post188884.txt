Is there any reason to buy a CD/DVD/Blu-Ray external unit? <body> I am seeing more and more laptops being purchased without any CD/DVD support.  I am interested in knowing why one would consider this purchase these days?  <answer188885> IMHO,there is no good reason to get a blu-ray external unit.  People use Flash memory sticks (USB).   They are smaller to handle and can hold many times the blue ray disk capacity.  Laptop is lighter and less battery consumption without DVD/Blu-ray drive.  The only reason to have a external blu-ray drive would be if you had a large blu-ray movie library.   I handle all with my MacBook Air, a good (fast Internet) and using iCloud, Google Drive ect as extended storage and for sharing with others.. I have 2 USB. One is emergency boot in case my MBA gets screwed up. That one is just 10 Gig USB. Then I also have a 128 Gig USB with movies on it ect. An average size for Blu-ray quality (1080p) movie is about 15 Gig.  <answer188887> I can only think of three reasons:  ul liFor looking at movies in the DVD/Blu-Ray format on your computer/li liFor creating DVDs and Blu-rays (if you're a video professional and its part of your job)/li liFor importing your Music CDs into a music application such as iTunes (this is especially true if you're one of those people who would much rather prefer buying a physical music CD over buying it on a digital music service like iTunes or streaming it on a streaming service like Spotify)/li /ul  For most people, however, there's no reason to use a CD/DVD/Blu-ray drive.  <comment223660> Don't forget about Wi-Fi- and Internet-based solutions, such as AirDrop and Dropbox. <comment223661> @chrisjr yes, you are right :) who needs blu-ray anyway. <comment223666> and maybe also for installling very old software if you need it <comment223667> I forgot about that. Thank you. <comment223671> And for reading old backups you made back in the days when CD/DVD drives were how you did backups <comment223672> @ScottEarle I thought of that, but I didn't think it was completely appropriate due to the fact that it would have been such a long time that all of those files would have been on those CDs are most likely backed up through more modern solutions. Basically, my list is based on modern examples. Even so, it's still a good example. <comment223673> A lot of people would have taken baby photos or videos of holidays, and saved them to DVD. But would not necessarily have felt the need to transfer them to a newer medium, since they already had the disk with the files saved on it. It's only recently that drives stopped being included in computers, so until recently there was no urgency to move data off disks ... <comment223674> @ScottEarle Ah. Good point.
