How can I delete a (null) app in usage? <body> In my usage list(settingsgeneralstorage &amp; iCloud usagemanage storage), there is an app that registers as (null) with no icon, a version number that doesn't match anything I've previously downloaded, and it's taking up storage space. I first noticed it about a week or two ago. And no, I can't download recent apps to find the one that it is, because I downloaded multiple apps recently, and didn't notice the (null) app until my storage was critically low and I was looking to delete something. I am running iOS 9.2.1 on an iPhone 5C.  <answer231392> You can try this way:  App StoreUpdatesPurchased  ol liView the apps you deleted/li liFind the app which about the same size with NULL app or version that match to the "Null" version/li liDownload the app again/li liRemove it again and delete the cache/li /ol  Hope it works for you.  <comment314540> Thanks! The other one randomly went away eventually, but another one popped up, and this helped
