Automatically eject disk image x minutes after mounting <body> So I have an encrypted disk image that I use to store sensitive files. However, I often forget to eject it when I'm done, which obviously negates the whole point of encryption. What I'd like is some tool, setting, etc. (perhaps a cron job?) that monitors when a specific disk image is mounted, waits a specific duration of time, and then displays a message notifying the user of imminent ejection. If the user does not opt to reset the timer, or doesn't respond, the image is ejected. Alternatively, it could also eject when the screen saver activates. Do any tools like that exist?  <answer220507> You can use a cronJob and an apple Script  unMount a disk with AppleScript :  precodeset mountedDiskName to "AirPort Time Capsule" set diskIsMounted to false  tell application "System Events" to set diskNames to name of every disk if mountedDiskName is in diskNames then     set diskIsMounted to true end if  if diskIsMounted then      //  put a sleep or a notification here, see explanation below      log "Disk Found, unmounting now..."     do shell script "diskutil unmountDisk" &amp; space &amp; quoted form of mountedDiskName  else      log "Disk Not Found, mounting nowâ€¦"     mount volume "afp://AirPort%20Time%20Capsule._afpovertcp._tcp.local"  end if /code/pre  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29332873/os-x-applescript-to-check-if-drive-mounted-and-mount-it-if-not  Make a cronJob to run the Script :  precode* * * * * osascript ~/Desktop/theScriptToBeExecuted.applescript /code/pre  How can I configure my computer to run an AppleScript at a specific time? Caveat: without using iCal  Put a sleep or a notification in "if diskIsMounted", because if you mount your disk at the cronTab start, your disk will be ejected before the end of your backup ;)   **I provide you a simple idea and some code to help you, you will certainly have to modify some code.
