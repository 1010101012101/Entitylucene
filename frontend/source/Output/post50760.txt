Applications occasionally start showing "The document could not be autosaved" dialogs <body> Every now and then, some application (usually TextEdit) starts showing dialogs like this when I try to close or save any document:     strongThe document “2.txt” could not be autosaved./strong      Your changes will not be saved until the problem is resolved. You can also duplicate the document or discard your changes to close it.   I'll have to quit and reopen the application in order to save anything again.  ul liI have disabled both Resume and locking files automatically in System Preferences/li liThe files have usually been in normal folders under my home folder and there hasn't been anything special about them as far as I can tell/li liI have tried repairing permissions/li liTextEdit's code signature is valid/li /ul  system.log usually has usually contained messages like this:  precode5/8/12 9:04:01.358 PM [0x0-0x17b17b].com.apple.TextEdit: [ERROR] GSLibrary.c:_AddGenerationInternal:393  Failed to consume sandbox extension; error 12 (Cannot allocate memory) 5/8/12 9:04:01.361 PM TextEdit: NSFileVersion tried to tried to add a new generation and failed.

Edit: I haven't seen those errors after I replaced TextEdit with TextEditPlus. It's based on TextEdit's source code but it disables sandboxing and makes a few other changes.  <answer50821> There's, in Lion, a emhidden/em way of repairing permissions, which seems to be even more effective:  ol liRestart Lion, and Before you hear the emchime/em, hold down KBDCmd/KBD + KBDR/KBD, to access emLion Recovery/em./li liClick the Utilities item in the Menu Bar, then click Terminal./li liIn the Terminal window, type strongresetpassword/strong and hit Return./li liThe password reset utility window launches, but you’re not going to reset the password.

Apparently, repairing permissions with Disk Utility, as usual, does not repair Users file permissions.   <answer80583> ol liSelect all the text in the document to clipboard (kbdCommand/kbd + kbdA/kbd/li liQuit and choose to discard changes to document./li liReopen the document.  /li liSelect all that is in document (now an old copy)./li liPaste the material that was previously copied out. /li liNow save the new, and complete document. /li /ol  <answer90113> It seems that this is actually a bug in Apple's sandboxing implementation. This means that none of the steps above should help. We had the same console output in one of our applications (including the inability to save text) and spent quite some time on finding the cause of the bug (see this radar). From what we've found out, it seems that after retrieving the recently opened documents for a number of times, the application cannot save files anymore because it does not get the permission to do so. You could try clearing the recently used documents menu, maybe this helps.  <answer251892> Copy the content and paste it into another document of the same type.  In Keynote, select all of the slides in Navigator view and drag them into the same pane of a new document.  <comment58248> I tried it, even though the permissions and owners of the files were completely normal. I'll accept this answer if I don't run into those dialogs in a week or so. <comment58319> TextEdit showed the error again now (with the same console output). So I'm assuming resetting the permissions didn't help... <comment58394> Are you working with a file which is not in your local machine? A file in iDisk or a Shared folder, perhaps? <comment58433> No. The logs just show local paths as `file://localhost` URLs for some reason.
