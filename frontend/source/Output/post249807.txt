How can I make my Mac shutdown a Windows PC when my UPS signals power loss? <body> I have an APC UPS connected to my iMac that's set to shutdown after 1 minute of running on UPS power. I also have a Windows 10 PC plugged into the UPS that I'd like shut down as well. Is there a way to send a shutdown command from my Mac to the Windows 10 PC telling it to shut down as well when a power loss is detected?  <answer249811> Take a look at this SuperUser question How can I shutdown a Windows machine remotely from OS X?. It recommends installing and using the codenet/code command:  precodenet rpc shutdown -I xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -U username%password /code/pre  You can then use a tool like Power Manager to trigger the codenet/code command when your UPS detects the power failure.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Opfdd.jpg" alt="Shut down event when UPS drops to 30%"  I work on Power Manager, so feel free to ask technical questions.
