how to import all iCloud contacts into Windows 10 People <body> how can I import all my iCloud contacts into the Windows 10 People app ?  <answer272103> You can export your contacts as vCards, then import these into Outlook/your mail client. If you can tell me what type of mail client you use, I can give specific instruction.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QrM4Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment342016> This will work but, just to clarify for the OP, it will not keep your iCloud and Windows contacts in sync.  This is a 1-time only export/import. <comment342017> @fsb Yup. He said import, so I assumed that he wasn't planning on syncing them. <comment342021> Agreed, I was just throwing it out there.
