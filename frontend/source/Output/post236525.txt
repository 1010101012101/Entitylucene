change download folder based on website from which I download <body> Is it possible to change Downloads folder in Google Chrome (or any other browser) on the fly, based on the website from which I download?  Example: I start downloading on codefacebook.com/code and it downloads the file in code~/Downloads/Facebook/code. If I start the download from codestackoverflow.com/code than the file is downloaded into code~/Downloads/Stackoverflow/code.  How can I achieve this? I imagine it would be possible to write a Stay Open AppleScript application that starts at computer startup and than continuously check domain name of my current tab. Not sure how I would change downloads folder on the fly though...  <answer236529> I know two products that do near the same thing as you want:  ol liHazel (14-Day Trial): You can write rules to do actions when events are occurred./li liSafariStand (Open Source): If you use OS X older that 10.11 it can be used. Although you can install codeSafariStand/code only on codeSafari/code and it organized downloaded files according to the date of download. You can use the source and find out how to customize and rebuild it./li /ol  <answer236532> You could write a folder action script which would parse your downloaded files metadata and move them into folders based on codekMDItemWhereFroms/code metadata attribute value.  Or just use Downloads Router Chrome Extension with predefined location rules.
