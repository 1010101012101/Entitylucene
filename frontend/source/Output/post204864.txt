Kernel Panic causing crash OSX10.10.5 <body> So I've been having a lot of kernel panics over the past few months, and the apple store says it's not hardware. I've taken it in several times under apple care (Still covered for one more year) and they have replaced the logic board.  Every time it crashes I look at the offending program and remove it. This one however I don't know.  Here is the log:  precodeTue Sep  8 09:54:18 2015  *** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff800b616df2): Kernel trap at 0xffffff800b5cf4a5, type 14=page fault, registers: CR0:

first thing I'd suspect is faulty RAM or bad third party kernel extensions, badly written applications shouldn't be able to cause kernel panics. From the panic report there don't seem to be any third-party extensions, so I'd check the RAM in your Mac.  There are diagnostic tools built into Macs to test, amongst other things, your RAM. Power down your Macbook, then power it on and hold down the D key. This should launch Apple Hardware Test. Within you should find Basic and Extended tests. Try them and see if it finds any problems with your Macbook's RAM.  You can read more here. https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201257  If you want to be really thorough there are other memtest utilities available online, that might find faults that Apple's tests don't.  http://www.kelleycomputing.net/rember/  http://osxdaily.com/2011/05/03/memtest-mac-ram-test/  <answer204890> According to the stank dump you posted, you have no 3rd-party kexts loaded.  USB devices cannot cause a kernel panic, and Java is sandboxed.  Therefore, the only option left is the RAM you chose.  Macs are MUCH more sensitive to RAM than PCs are.  The RAM you choose must be DDR3 1600MHz and support a CAS latency of 11 at 1.35v.  If you purchased RAM that has different specs (even if they're better), then it's not compatible.  Often times, faster memory requires higher voltages or have more relaxed timings to achieve those speeds.  PCs have no problems with this because the SPD chip tells the memory controller what timings the RAM supports.  But because Apple cherry-picks their hardware for their own platform, Macs ignore those settings in favor of the RAM that Apple specifically chose for that model.  The RAM timings and voltage are fixed by the firmware.  You don't mention what RAM you bought, but CAS latency and voltage are not the usual marketing specs you'd find when shopping for memory.  You have to specifically look for those specs.  Assuming you bought off-the-shelf RAM, it's likely being undervolted by the power management capabilities of your Mac.  A memtest wouldn't pick up on that because the RAM is good (when it has full power), so all the cells would check out OK.  If you did shop around and bought memory specifically certified for your Mac, I'd still blame the RAM and try to have it exchanged.  There's nothing in that panic report that would indicate you have a software problem.  <comment246990> And your question is? <comment247003> sorry, what I'm trying to find is the cause of this one <comment247005> I will check the RAM. I did install new ram recently, however I thought I did a full pass with memtest86 <comment247016> -1 for details. Removing an app due to kernel panics needs finer explanation and specifics. Are you removing system components? Why haven't you uninstalled Java entirely? What is the frequency of panics since the last system update / modification you have performed. Can you cause a panic or is is a rare occurrence? <comment247023> I've had several over the last few months, mostly related to software I had installed such as Duet, and a few other programs. I have since uninstalled and removed any remanences of them. Saying it's java isn't really specific, considering how many things are running java. It doesn't even say what version of java it was using for me to uninstall. I get them about once a week, but all different causes. It's usually when I'm compiling code, but not always. I've had my computer sitting idle and have had a crash <comment247046> Yeah, tonight I'll run memtest86. When I was shopping I asked for MacRam at a reputable place, he did sell me a set. He told me they didn't have the certified apple sticker on them, but was compatible. It is 1600MHz, don't remember the latency off my head. <comment247054> What hardware are you using? Press `D` during startup to test your RAM. <comment247077> I'll be doing that when I get home from work. I have a mid 2013 MBP. I recently installed more ram, although this problem is older than that. I did do memetest but again I'll do it again tonight and update. <comment247193> I've checked the RAM and all seems good. It passed the built in diagnostic, and I ran MemTest86 overnight with no errors with 4 passes. <comment247194> I've checked the RAM and all seems good. It passed the built in diagnostic, and I ran MemTest86 overnight with no errors with 4 passes. <comment247196> Sometimes there can be problems the tests don't catch. Do you still have the original RAM? Can you try running the machine for a while with just the original RAM in the laptop? See if the panics still happen. <comment247199> Thanks for the reply. I still have the original 8GB RAM, and the crashes actually started on that. I only recently upgraded to 16GB, because my work needs it. While working I usually average around 10GB used, so going back isn't an option for me. Not to mention that these crashes are about 6 months old, while the RAM is about 3 weeks old. <comment247202> Well if it was happening with old RAM and now with completely different RAM then it's unlikely to be the RAM. :) When the MacBook panics do you have any other devices plugged in? If so can you try running for a while with nothing plugged in? <comment247204> Yeah, I'll have to think about that. I think the only thing I've had plugged in every time it's occurred has been my external monitor (thunderbolt to VGA or DVI) and my bluetooth magic mouse. The other curious thing is before the crash there is always screen glitches, but not all screen glitches are followed by a crash.
