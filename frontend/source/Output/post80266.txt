NAT port forwarding from host to client in VMWare Fusion 5? <body> How do I forward ports from my host machine to the virtualized machine when I'm using NAT to share my network connection? I found some instructions for earlier versions of VMWare, but I don't see the files they mention in the same location in my installation.  <answer80343> Okay, I found out where it's located - code/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/vmnet8/nat.conf/code  So, open it up (VMWare shouldn't be running while you do this):  precodesudo nano /Library/Preferences/VMware\ Fusion/vmnet8/nat.conf /code/pre  Go down in the file, there should be a section like:  precode[incomingtcp]  # Use these with care - anyone can enter into your VM through these... # The format and example are as follows: #&lt;external port number&gt; = &lt;VM's IP address&gt;:&lt;VM's port number&gt; #35 = 172.16.126.128:22 /code/pre  Uncomment that last line, and edit as appropriate.  Couple of notes:  ul liThese instructions are for TCP port forwarding, there's a corresponding code[incomingudp]/code section for UDP/li liIf for some reason this section doesn't already exist, just add it/li /ul  <answer110523> Based on the VMWare knowledge base.     The following commands can be used to update the changes without   restarting Fusion 4.x and later. These can be used if you not want to   relaunch Fusion, if you have other Virtual Machines running.   precodesudo /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmnet-cli --stop sudo /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmnet-cli --start /code/pre  Make sure you skip the --configure step as it will reset the nat.conf file to defaults.

Perhaps it should be an edit to the other answer, or have the other answer's content added here (with credit, of course), to have a single answer that covers the complete steps? <comment229897> So this is a global setting that affects _all_ virtual machines? <comment230801> @SargeBorsch You specify the IP of the VM that forwarding is configured for. <comment326789> and then restart vmware network: `sudo /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmnet-cli --stop;     sudo /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmnet-cli --start`
