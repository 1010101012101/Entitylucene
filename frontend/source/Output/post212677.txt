How to prevent iPad from using Personal Hotspot? <body> My iPhone5 keeps advertising itself as a Personal Hotspot even though I set that to off. My WiFi only iPad keeps connecting to the iPhone HotSpot every time my WiFi router fails. This is driving up my data usage. How do I make the iPad forget the Personal Hotspot? I have already factory defaulted the Network Settings but it appears anyway. I have also changed the Personal Hotspot password on the iPhone and it connects anyway.  <answer212682> On the iPad, in codeSettings &gt; Wifi/code, tap the 'i' in a circle icon next to the listing for the Personal Hotspot, then tap the strongForget This Network/strong tab.   You should make absolutely sure the Personal Hotspot is turned off. Looking at codeSettings &gt; Personal Hotspot/code, it is pretty unambiguous.  You should also check to see if Instant Hotspot has been enabled:     Instant hotspot      You can use Personal Hotspot on your iPhone to provide Internet access to your other devices without additional setup. You'll need to sign in to iCloud using the same Apple ID as your iPhone. Also, your cellular provider needs to provision your Personal Hotspot.   To get Internet access from your iPhone:   On your iPad or iPod touch, go to Settings  Wi-Fi on your other iOS device and select your iPhone or iPad that has a cellular connection.   On your Mac, go to the Wi-Fi menu at the top of your screen and select your iPhone or iPad that has a cellular connection.   From this Apple Support Page
