Credits in spotlight.app <body> At em/System/Library/CoreServices/Spotlight.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/em There is a fake called "Credits.rtf" only containing some random text.  Is it an easter egg or something malicious?  p.s it's also in the other xx.iproj folders.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4UtGb.jpg" alt="Screenshot"  <answer249391> That's the default text inside the same Credits.rtf file when creating a new OS X Application in Xcode.  I assume Apple didn't bother changing it since they figured no one would bother looking.  <comment309287> Let's just assume it's a placeholder & if no credits need giving, then Mom gets it :)
