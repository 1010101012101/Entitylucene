color picker magnifying glass missing <body> I am running Yosemite and the color picker is supposed to have a magnifying glass. Except I do not have this and cannot turn it on. I do not see the magnifying glass as shown between the tool bar and the colour wheel.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BO2ss.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer173404> It is now a more appropriate Pipette icon.  You can see it at the bottom of the picker  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ipuUW.png" alt="enter image description here"
