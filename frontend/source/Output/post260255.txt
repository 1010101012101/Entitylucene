How to use cmd + V to paste into a Ubuntu VM in Parallels? <body> I emthink/em that I have the proper settings that should allow me to use kbdCommand/kbd kbd V/kbd to paste into my Parallels Ubuntu command line:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nyg5Em.png" alt="enter image description here"  and   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sIIWum.png" alt="enter image description here"  But when I try to paste into the command line using kbdCommand/kbd kbd V/kbd nothing happens.  If type that twice in a row code^V/code appears in the command line, but not the text in my clipboard.  How can I get kbdCommand/kbd kbd V/kbd working to paste?  <comment325764> The *caret* "^" and the letter is a symbol that you get when when you press *Ctrl*, not *Command*  and letter combination. Do you have it remapped or are you using an Apple keyboard? <comment325768> I'm using an Apple Keyboard <comment325769> have you tried to paste using `ctrl + v`? <comment325772> Yes.  I'd rather not have to use `ctrl`, but it didn't work either way. <comment325800> Did you install the Parallels Tools properly?
