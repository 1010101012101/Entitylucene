Iphone 4S ios7 No Sound at all <body> A couple of weeks ago I replaced the cracked LCD on my iphone 4S and updated to ios7. That's when the sound problems started but it may be coincidence?!  Initially I started to get intermittent sound problems, but then after a couple of days the sound stopped working and would only work for about 10 seconds after unlocking the phone. Couple of days later the sound has gone altogether. No ringtones, message tones, no keypad or lock tones, no app sounds and it won't play music- if I go on the music app, I try to play a song but it quickly skips through every track on the album without playing anything. When someone calls me (I cant hear it) but if I answer, I cant hear them and they cant hear me.   The switch on the side is NOT on mute.  Volume is fully turned up.  Things I have tried so far: 1) Cleaned the dock with brush and alcohol 2) Cleaned headphone jack 3) Cleaned tiny Mic hole  4) Inserted headphones in/out many times 5) Put the iphone on my speaker dock many times (to try to establish if stuck in dock mode -still no sound and refusing to play music etc when on my speaker dock) 6) Replaced the dock connector with brand new one as I though maybe pins damaged 7) Just replaced the speaker enclosure with a new one as i though maybe the speaker had blown. 8) Restarted many times 9) Backed up the phone and restored  Literally at my wits end!! Still no sound AT ALL!  Anybody have any ideas??  <comment148682> do you get any sound through headphones when they are plugged in?
