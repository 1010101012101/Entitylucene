Finder on Mac Always On <body> I've always wondered why the Finder application on Mac computers are always on and why there's no way to quit out of them. Does anyone have an idea or supposition about why it is? Are there any consequences if the Finder is not always on?  <answer249836> Open the Script Editor application and select New Document. Enter the following line  precodetell application "Finder" to quit /code/pre  then run the script. The Finder application will quit.  You can also quit the Finder application by entering the following command in a Terminal application window.  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to quit' /code/pre  Nothing special happens if the Finder application is not running.  Sometimes it is useful to quit the Finder application and reopen as the root user. Below is the Terminal application commands for opening as root user. emI assume here that you have first quit any previous opened Finder applications./em  If using Yosemite (OS X 10.10):  precodesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder 2&gt;&amp;1 | logger &amp; /code/pre  If using Yosemite (OS X 10.10) or El Capitan (OS X 10.11):  precodesudo login -f root /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder 2&gt;&amp;1 | logger &amp; exit /code/pre  <answer249837> Having Finder closed shouldn't cause any problems.  You can add a strongQuit Finder ⌘Q/strong command to the Finder menu...  Copy and paste the following command into Terminal, then press kbdenter/kbd.  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder QuitMenuItem 1; killall -HUP Finder /code/pre  Note: When Finder is closed and an external disk is plugged in it will still be available to applications through the File  Open, File  Save, etc. commands.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5EKvU.png" alt="Quit Finder Menu"  hr  To remove the strongQuit Finder ⌘Q/strong command from the Finder menu...

Sometimes I just don't want to be distracted by what's on my Desktop, so I quit Finder.  <comment310030> sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder & doesn't prompt me for password, as it should, and returns the PID of `sudo` without actually opening Finder's UI. Finder doesn't show in Activity Monitor however it does show in Terminal using `ps aux | grep [F]inder` and shows it owned by `root`. That said, what good is opening Finder via `sudo` if Finder's UI doesn't show. If I then click the Finder Dock Tile the UI shows but the PID is owned by me while the hidden occurrence is still there, till I `sudo kill PID` when `PID` is what was returned from the original command. <comment310035> @user3439894: I update my answer to include instructions for both Yosemite and El Capitan.
