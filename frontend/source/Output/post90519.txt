How do I switch between signatures when modifying a PDF using Preview? <body> I have more than one signature, however when selecting Tools - Annotate - Signature, only the most recent signature is inserted.   Is there an option to change the default?  <answer90520> First, click the Annotations button  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QruHl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then click the down arrow on the Signatures button  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bqb9s.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can then select the signature you wish to use.
