iMac Pixelated Screen <body> I just recently acquired an iMac. I'm not sure what model it is or anything but the attached pictures show it.  When it boots up there's a pixelated screen and it won't boot into the OS, and when I try to boot from a CD it says that the computer needs to restart.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X9BNm.jpg" alt="screen" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1SLx.jpg" alt="msg"  <answer256870> The model &amp; serial numbers are on the underside of the foot. That doesn't have any bearing on the issues you're seeing- an inability to boot from its internal drive as well as a corrupted video signal showing a kernel panic screen- which is probably the result of a hardware failure in the display cable or connector or an issue with the system board video circuitry.   Another possibility is that the previous owner got a little too adventurous &amp; mishandled disconnecting or reconnecting the front panel's display connector. Ifixit.com has instructions on how to open your model iMac so you can check the connectors for damage.   You may not have much recourse if you were not informed that the iMac was in this condition before you purchased it other than to have it repaired at your nearest Apple repair shop or Apple Store.  <comment320492> Well, it was free so if it's toast I assume it's probably out of warranty + fine to open up. How much would a repair job go for, though, if I took it to apple? <comment320493> Also, I popped a windows disk in and it seemed to stop the whole weird screen thing it had going on. <comment320495> Cost of repair will depend on what's actually broken & in need of replacement. The internal drive will need attention or replacement, the system board or discrete graphics adapter (or both) may also need replacement. And last but not least the display itself may be the cause of the corrupted video issue. So there's quite a range for what it may cost to repair. <comment320496> Highest cost range? <comment320497> Was that a Windows install disk? Which version? <comment320498> What size is the display? <comment320499> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/46662/discussion-between-karlc-and-user2544765). <comment320508> Have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  Post the results to your original question. <comment320511> Hardware failure, no doubt. <comment320617> @Allan Yes, it said that it wasn't compatible with that Mac. I'm thinking it's toast. <comment320628> AHT *not* compatible?  Hmmmm....  The next thing I would do is get a Linux Live USB that boots on Mac (Ubuntu for example) and see if you can get things to load and then do some diagnostics on the drive.  If you can boot that way, we are on our way to diagnosing whatever issues you may have.
