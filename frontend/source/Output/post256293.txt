How do I stop or at least partly reduce the number of times I need to type in my Apple password <body> I use iBooks, the app store, Apple Music and iTunes on my mac and iphone.  Apple asks me for my password at least twice a week on each device.  Does it anyone know how to prevent this?  Scenarios:  + I simply open iBooks on my Mac + I am listening to Apple Music + I open my iPhone with touch ID  I am not even buying anything.  <comment319614> I'm not sure I understand your question.  Apple will automatically sign you out of their apps if not being used for a specific period of time (I'm thinking that's 48-60 hours but not sure).  Of course, that's per app, per device. <comment319724> 48 hours? So if I don't read for 48 hours it signs me out of iBooks. That insane and bizarre <comment319822> That timeframe was just a guess.  I know it happens to me once or twice a week because I'm moving between multiple devices all the time.
