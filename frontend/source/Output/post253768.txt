Find files in Terminal by kind - not extension? <body> I have about 50,000 files in a folder tree which show up as the correct "Kind" in Finder ("Sound Designer II audio") but which have no extension.  I want to find all these and rename them to code*.sd2/code in Terminal.  Can the codefind/code command be used to find by "kind" without any extension?  <answer253772> To search all files with a distinctive strongkind/strong use the command:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemKind="Sound Designer II audio"' /code/pre  If this is not sufficient you can also use the type code (yyyy below is a place holder only)  precodemdfind 'kMDItemFSTypeCode="yyyy"' /code/pre  You should be able get an (unknown) type code of a Sound Designer II audio file by executing codemdls "/path/to/Sound Designer II audio file" | grep kMDItemFSTypeCode/code  <comment315851> Fantastic! How would I run a command on each result, like the `-exec` argurment of `find`? <comment315865> @Ze'ev Probably some `... | xargs -0 -I mv '{}' ...` thingy
