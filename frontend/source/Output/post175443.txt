How to remove an empty group in Launchpad <body> I installed Google IME and uninstalled it. Then, as shown in the image below, an empty group is left in Launchpad. (I think it should have been removed automatically when the group became empty.) How can I remove the empty group manually?  OSX 10.10.2img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7kj0O.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189284> If you move an app into the empty folder and then go into that empty folder and drag the app back out onto the launchpad the empty folder will disappear.  <answer269011> Previous answer didn't help me on Yosemite - when I dragged app into the empty folder the app just disappeared for a while and the folder was still there, empty and disturbing. But then I've found a way to fix it without resetting Launchpad:  Click and hold any random app until all icons start shaking, then drag the app on the folder, DON'T RELEASE, and drag back into its place. Right after dragging back the empty folder has disappeared.  <comment206845> Did you try to restart your Mac? <comment206853> @gruberb I restarted my MacBookPro (Late 2012) many times and tried Command+R, reinstalling Yosemite once. But, the empty group is still there. <comment206854> Then have a look at this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/150965/how-to-reset-launchpad-ordering-in-os-x-yosemite Caution: You'll loose your order and the Launchpad will be reset. <comment206855> @gruberb Thanks for your suggestion. My MacBookPro is a Late 2012 model, which means that there are many apps organized in Launchpad. Given this, I would rather put up with the current situation. Thanks anyway. <comment206860> One another solution can be: Wait until the update to 10.10.3 is out, so your empty folder will propably be gone. You can also look deeper and open the .pslist and look for this entry. (look at my link to apple.stackexchange above)
