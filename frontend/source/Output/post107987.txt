How can my website tell safari it's ok to save passwords? <body> When I logged into my website in safari, I got the following message:     safari will not save your password because MyWebsite requested passwords not be   saved   What meta tag/value do I need on my site to tell Safari it's ok?  <answer108002> Make sure you don't have codeautocomplete=off/code in any of the forms.  This is the primary way that a website can tell a browser not to save passwords.  By default, if the website doesn't have anything, the browser will be happy to save passwords, so odds are that your website contains something like that somewhere.
