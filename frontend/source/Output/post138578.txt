Enable ~/Sites Folder <body> I have been following this tutorial in order to setup my local code~/Sites/code folder.  code/etc/apache2/users/carloabelli.conf/code:  precode&lt;Directory "/Users/carloabelli/Sites/"&gt;     Options FollowSymLinks Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride All     Order allow,deny     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  I have restarted apache numerous times. Whenever I go the the url codehttp://localhost/~carloabelli/code I get the following response:  precode403 Forbidden  You don't have permission to access /~carloabelli on this server. /code/pre  What else do I need to do to get this to work?  <answer138584> Take a look at the Permissions set on the code/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Sites/code Folder.  The "web user" (i think on Mac www is used for this) must have the Rights to read and execute so in most cases a codechmod o+rx /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Sites/code should be enough.  If this doesn't work let us know what you are using to control your Webserver? OSX Server or MAMP or something else?  <answer193283> In your httpd.conf file you will see User and Group at the top You have to sent   precodeUser &lt;your uer name&gt; Group www (no change needed) /code/pre  You have to change it because the default codeapache/code user code_www/code which will not have access to the directories under code&lt;user&gt;/code, code_www/code will have access only to code/Library/WebServer/Documents//code So you have to change the user in httpd.conf.  So that apache can access the files under your user Documents.  Hope it helps  <answer294272> Aside from getting the permissions correct for reading and executing the Sites directory and its parents, recent configs, i.e, 10.12, require additional configuration options in several files:   code/etc/apache2/httpd.conf./code -- uncomment:  precode    LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so     ...     Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf /code/pre  code/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf/code -- Uncomment:  precode    Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf /code/pre  Create a file code/etc/apache2/users/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE.conf/code with:  precode&lt;Directory "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/Sites/"&gt;     Options Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride All     Order allow,deny     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  If the lines are commented out, your per-user file will not be read.
