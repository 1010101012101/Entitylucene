Add recovery partition back onto drive after drive change <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How to recreate Lion Recovery HD partition?       I hope this question is different enough from the others that is doesn't get closed.  I am first time Mac user, long time Linux user, so pardon my ignorance in the Apple terminology.  I have a late 2011 MBP that I replaced the drive with an SSD.  I didn't care about the contents so I just stuck in the drive and Apple magically gave me OSX Lion again.  The SSD was too small, so I bought a bigger one and cloned the drive with SuperDuper.  It took a long time to boot afterwards, but it did so I thought everything was great.  Then I eventually noticed my recovery partition was not cloned with the rest of my data.  I still have the old drive with the recovery partition and I have enough space to add the partition back to the current/new drive.  My question is:  What is the easiest way to get my recovery partition back after losing it completely, without reinstalling from the internet (unless reinstalling won't mess with my data)?  I have a USB enclosure for the drive that has the partition.  I don't know if it matters, but I originally had Lion and upgraded to Mountain Lion.  <answer68603> Reinstalling over an existing system does not create a Recovery HD.  strongWARNING: This is low level disk editing code and emwill/em hurt your disk if not done properly.
