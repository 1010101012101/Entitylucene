How can I install Safari, without a browser or itunes access? <body> I do not seem to have Safari on my iPhone 4.  I also do not seem to have iTunes installed, or any access to iTunes.  I have tried resetting my home-screen layout, but Safari and itunes still are not there.    I have tried to download the Safari install file to my PC, hoping to somehow transfer it to my iPhone.  But iTunes will not give up the file because I do not have iOS installed on the PC.  Any ideas, please?  <answer199732> As @Graham Miln suggested, it is most likely set this way in restrictions, assuming your phone isn't jail broken. Go to strongSettings - General - Restrictions/strong and enable safari.  There is no way to install or uninstall Safari on an iOS device - it is a part of the operating system, nor is it possible to "have iOS installed on the PC"  <comment240511> What iOS? Is it Jailbroken? What version iTunes? <comment240519> Is Safari disabled in **Settings  General  Restrictions** ? http://osxdaily.com/2011/11/01/how-to-hide-youtube-safari-and-other-default-app-icons-in-ios-5/ <comment240605> Graham Miln, thank you very much!  Yes, that was exactly the problem.  I had never changed any of the Restrictions settings myself, so I didn't even know to look there.  I am obviously very ignorant of how to use this phone!  And I'm very grateful for your help.  Thank you.
