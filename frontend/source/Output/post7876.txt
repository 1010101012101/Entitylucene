How can I read the log when I fail with VPN <body> I have a Macbook Pro and I'm trying to get VPN from home to work. It refuse to work. I have turned on verbose logging, but how can I read the log ?  <answer7878> Whether you choose L2TP over IPSec or PPTP for your settings, the log file is located at:     /var/log/ppp.log   If you want use terminal to view your log file you can do following:     vim /var/log/ppp.log             tail -f /var/log/ppp.log       (if you   want see end of file)      less /var/log/ppp.log  (if your log   file was huge and want to see page by   page)   <answer7890> For completeness, I'll add a way to view the log in the GUI: Open the Console utility, select Show Log List from the toolbar (if it isn't already shown), then select FILES  /private/var/log  ppp.log from the sidebar.  <comment8543> For additional information on IPSec, use the built-in "syslog" command to query all logs for messages from the racoon key management daemon:       syslog -k Facility -k Sender racoon <comment310764> This answer no longer seems relevant: on OS X El Capitan, there is no /var/log/ppp.log.  There is a /var/log/ppp/ directory, but it's empty.  Logs seem to go into /var/log/system.log.
