Move 'Pictures', 'Documents', 'Movies' etc folders <body> I would like to move folders like 'Pictures', 'Documents', 'Movies' to a different from the default under the root of user's home location, preferably into a sub-folder under the same user's home folder. For example, user/Music would go to user/stuff/Music.  I'd rather not create symbolic links to moved folders, but change system's behaviour altogether, so it knows where to find those folders.  Please bear in mind that I do not want to move user's home folder, but just those ones, for example, move them to /Users/[user name]/stuff/ since I don't like them polluting the home folder there.  <answer25933> You can move your entire user account (home) folder using the following steps:  ol liClick on Users &amp; Groups in System Preferences./li liUnlock the pane (lock icon)./li liRight click on your selected user and choose the "advanced" option from the list./li liYou will be greeted by the following screen:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vCU7o.png" alt="enter image description here"  From there, simply select the "home directory" to which you wish to relocate the profile to, then reboot.  Note: This will move emall/em the contents found under code/Users/{your user}//code (Downloads, Documents, Music, etc.)  <answer25947> I personally use symlinks to move all of those directories under my User account. I logged in as root and symlinked all of my directories "Documents' Downloads " Movies", etc and moved them to an external drive.   Mac OS sees the changes just fine and points to those directories (on the external drive) automatically and I have had no issues doing it this way.  There is a System Service called strongcodeSymbolicLinker/code/strong that will add an option to your context menu that will create a symbolic link for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtTDv.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2How to enable the root user/h2  strongOS X Lion/strong  ol liFrom the Apple menu choose System Preferences.... /li liFrom the View menu choose Users &amp; Groups. /li liClick the lock and authenticate as an administrator account. /li liClick Login Options.... /li liClick the "Edit..." or    "Join..." button at the bottom right. /li liClick the "Open Directory    Utility..." button. /li liClick the lock in the Directory Utility window.    /li liEnter an administrator account name and password, then click OK.    /li liChoose Enable Root User from the Edit menu. /li liEnter the root password you wish to use in both the Password and Verify fields, then click OK./li /ol  strongMac OS X v10.6.x/strong  ol liFrom the Apple menu choose System Preferences..../li liFrom the View menu choose Accounts./li liClick on the lock and authenticate with an administrator account./li liClick Login Options..../li liClick the "Edit..." or "Join..." button at the bottom right./li liClick the "Open Directory Utility..." button./li liClick the lock in the Directory Utility window./li liEnter an administrator account name and password, then click OK./li liChoose Enable Root User from the Edit menu./li liEnter the root password you wish to use in both the Password and Verify fields, then click OK./li /ol  <answer25970> Well, the short answer is: strongDon't/strong, because too many things depend on it. This is also the reason why Apple choose to make it difficult to rename these folders.   If you want to take the risk anyway, this answer to a somewhat related question should give you some ideas.  <answer26132> Just move them wherever you like. The only important one is Library and for the rest you can normally choose where apps place stuff.  There's only a few crappy apps that won't allow you to change where they write stuff, Microsoft and Adobe apps come to mind. They will put files in ~/Documents. All the rest will work with your files no matter where you put them.   <answer47809> I would not suggest you to move your entire home folder, instead it is better to make symbolic links of your folders to external drive. After that you will get:  ol liFlexibility - if something happens with your external HD (remember that your hidden emLibrary folder/em is on main drive if HDD is down you will need to do something because it will be down too), you will be able to start repairing it right in that moment without turning it off./li liIn case if your main drive is SSD - when your emhome folder/em is on your main drive it loads up faster, when it would be on external./li liIf you have Mac Pro - you can set for emmovies folder/em one HD, for emmusic folder/em another HD.../li /ol  <answer50245> Art,  Do you have this working successfully?  Have you tried hiding the folders using something like:  precodechflags hidden ~/Documents  /code/pre  Then creating a link to it such as (in Terminal):  precodecd ~ mkdir stuff cd stuff ln -s ~/Documents /code/pre  I believe that this will hide the ~/Documents folder from the Finder but it will still be there so anything writing to it will work OK.  In addition you will see the link in ~/stuff...  <answer230329> You can try to add the following Bash code to your ~/.bash_profile. It changes the codels/code command when run in code$HOME/code to not show certain folders ("Music", "Movies", "Pictures", etc.).   All this does is change what codels/code displays in the code$HOME/code directory. It doesn't actually delete the folders. For example, if you do codels -l/code you will see that the folders are still there.  precodefunction ls-home() {         excludeDirectories=(         "Music"         "Movies"         "Pictures"         "Public"         "Documents"         "Desktop"         "Downloads"         "VirtualBox VMs"         )          files=$(comm -23 &lt;( /bin/ls -1) &lt;(printf '%s\n' "${excludeDirectories[@]}" | sort))          temporary_dir=$(mktemp -d)          for file in $files; do                 if [ -h $file ]; then                         ln -s $file $temporary_dir/$file                 elif [ -f $file ]; then                         touch $temporary_dir/$file                         if [ -x $file ]; then                                 chmod +x $temporary_dir/$file                         fi                 else                         mkdir $temporary_dir/$file                 fi         done          /bin/ls $temporary_dir         rm -rf $temporary_dir }  function ls-shim() {         if [ "$(pwd)" = "$HOME" ]; then                 lastArgument="${@:-1}"                 if [ "${lastArgument:0}" = 1 ];  then                         ls-home                 else                         /bin/ls "$@"                 fi         else                 /bin/ls "$@"         fi }  alias ls="ls-shim" /code/pre  Screenshots of script in action: img src="https://i.imgur.com/cPdtdVy.png" alt="The &#39;ls&#39; shim in action" img src="https://i.imgur.com/oZfli4c.png" alt="Regular &#39;ls&#39;"  <answer276389> I added a Transcend 256G drive in the expansion slot and tried this process but it did NOT move the data.  It DID create a new profile with all the folders relocated to the expansion drive BUT I had to manually move all data from the internal SSD to the new location.  I eventually got what I wanted but I had to recreate the entire profile (Outlook email account, preferences etc).  <comment29553> @chsum: Are you sure the actual contents of Documents, Pictures etc. are moved? I would assume that OSX just creates a new home directory structure in the indicated place, the content must be moved by the user himself afterwards. <comment29559> cksum, from the way I read the question, the asker does not want to move his entire home folder directory or user account. He wants to retain his home directory but move certain system-defined sub-folders out from under his home folder to remote volumes or places outside his home folder for disk space reasons. <comment29575> I +1'd this answer, but I also have to say that I strongly agree with this. I understand your desire, but it's a bad idea, and likely just impossible because the OS would just re-create them anyway unless you get into mucking around with things you shouldn't be mucking around with. <comment29581> The best way is to [move your whole home directory altogether](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25932/move-pictures-documents-movies-etc-folders/25933#25933). Just did that to free some space on my SSD—worked perfectly fine. <comment29582> **Just make sure that if you *do* want to keep your content, first copy the home folder to whatever location you prefer, *then* change this setting to match the new location.** Just changing this setting doesn't copy any files—you'll start clean again. <comment29584> May I disagree? I just seamlessly moved my home folder using  [this reference](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25932/move-pictures-documents-movies-etc-folders/25933#25933) so I can save some space on SSD drive. Yes, you can't move individual folders but your post sounds as if moving the entire home folder is hard to do, when it fact it's not. <comment29586> This is a cool trick. I just thought it would've been nicer if you could expand a little for not-so-power-users? A link on how to enable root account, an explanation on how to launch this System Service would help a lot. <comment29589> When you download the service extension, there will be instructions on how to install it. Basically, you just copy **`SymbolicLinker.service`** to **`/Library/Services/`**, then log out and log back in. <comment29593> Edited answer with instructions on how to enable root user for Lion and Snow. <comment29599> Well-written answer, but I have to agree with other users that you will be messing with things that Mac OS X, for good reason, does not want you to mess with, and you may be unnecessarily complicating your system's structure. **Please think about this: Is Time Machine going to back up these folders and their contents now that you have moved them to another hard drive?** You had better confirm this. <comment29601> Also, if that new place is a different drive, make sure to make a second emergency administrator account in case the new drive where your home folder is sitting fails. <comment29604> @WheatWilliams yes, actually, Time Machine backs up these directories pretty well for me. <comment29628> Thanks Dan, but I don't actually want to move my home folder, just those ones I mentioned, I'd rather have them under 'Documents' or some other folder, which in its own turn, sits under user's home. I don't really like how those folders pollute the home directory with their presence. <comment29630> Sorry but I don't want them symlinked, this is one of the requirements in my question. <comment29631> If there's a reason I don't see it yet - there's a way you can be flexible with these names - for instance in Windows you can always refer to those folders using aliases, i.e. %System% etc. Looks like standard single-minded stubborness with Apple logo to me. <comment29632> Thanks cksum, but I don't want to move my home folder, just these folders - I just don't like them sitting straight under user's home. <comment29639> Dan, moving the whole home folder is easy (as pointed out already in another answer), renaming specific folder names (which appears to be the original question) isn't. <comment29919> If you dislike their presence *and* don't use them, issue `chflags hidden folder` to hide any of them in Finder. This won't move them of course but I like to hide `Public` folder, for instance. <comment30048> I would actually like to *keep* using them, Dan, although move them. <comment54856> I am afraid I didn't make myself clear enough - I don't want to move folders to _other drive_, I just want them out of sight from the root of home folder (i.e. hidden under some 'Apple junk' folder) <comment54866> "I just thought it would've been nicer if you could expand a little for not-so-power-users?" if your not a power user, you'd be best not messing with the root account <comment55047> I am sorry but this answer is very loosely related to the original question. I specifically do not want to move the home folder or create symbolic links. <comment57688> That actually sounds very promising, I will give it a shot, thanks man! <comment57689> Although they are still visible in terminal after 'ls -la', I am glad you suggested this solution which will cover around 90% of cases for me. Thank you! <comment86990> I would -100 this answer if I could.  On my computer I do whatever I want!  Including removing the useless directories. <comment126198> This is perfect, thanks.  It still would be cooler if you could somehow rename them... if the default folder names started with lower case and I'd probably keep them around. <comment246267> It still adds value to the discussion, besides I agree <comment281127> Can you add some explanation about what your script does? <comment316666> I cannot retract my upvote. To any future visitor: this script does not work as desired. <comment317030> @Newb thanks for your comment, I'll take a look today <comment317033> @Newb the script is working fine for me, could your explain your issue in greater detail? How did you install it?
