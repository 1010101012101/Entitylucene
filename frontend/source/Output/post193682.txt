Looking for an iPhone application that can send contact info to an online API <body> I'm looking for an iPhone application that by clicking a button can send a single contact information (phone number, first name,last name, company name)  to a REST online API. The server address should be set in the App configuration (or hard-coded if necessary). Of course It would need to authenticate with the REST server.  Thanks  <comment230924> Are you talking about contacts within the iOS Contacts app and possibly iCloud contacts or from contacts within the 3rd party app itself? <comment230931> @wide_eyed_pupil im talking about a case where an incoming calling number can be saved to a WEB API on the fly or by choosing a contact from the iOS contacts app.
