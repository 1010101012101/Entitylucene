Outlook 2011: Added an Exchange profile, lost previous profile data <body> A friend of mine wanted to use an Exchange account additionally to his normal profile (POP3 email, calendar etc.) in Outlook 2011.  He said he just added and configured the profile. When he re-openend Outlook 2011 the old profile and all data was lost.  I searched the harddisk, but there's only the "fresh" profile data files of the Main Identity in the Documents/Microsoft User Data folder.  What did happen here? Is there a chance he can recover the data?
