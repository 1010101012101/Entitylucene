Mac not sleeping when lid is closed <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2014) running El Capitan. Whenever I close the lid it doesn't sleep! The Apple light dims and the screen turns off, but my battery drains at a normal rate. Sleep is also grayed out in the top-left ï£¿ menu.  Please help!  <answer229449> Did you check Energy Saver in System Preferences?  Tick on your machine everything you see on above screen and try again.  Especially focus on strong"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off"/strong option. Uncheck it and see how battery behaves.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkagW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer229616> Google "reset smc" and you can learn how to reset the SMC and PRAM for your particular machine in just a few minutes. It refreshes various stored settings akin to restarting your Mac and it's really easy so it's worth a try. It just might help. [5 min job, 5 to read] Good luck.  <comment279896> That's what I have checked as it is. Thanks for the quick reply btw :-) <comment279897> So maybe you have any third party apps that interact with your batter or interrupt the process of going to sleep? <comment279899> The only apps I have open right now are Chrome and Finder, and I don't have any apps in the background. <comment279933> Try unchecking Power Nap as well, as it will use some extra battery too. <comment279946> Can you connect to the machine while the lid is closed? Ping it? <comment280014> I can see it in AirDrop when it's closed, and I can copy a file to my computer using it (the dialog is open when I open my computer; I have to open it to say yes). <comment280269> Tried that; my adapter light flashed green then back to red (I take it this means it worked) and powered on as usual, but no difference.
