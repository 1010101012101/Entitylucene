iOS 10 Safari JavaScript setting disabled <body> Today, JavaScript in Safari suddenly stopped functioning. I had just updated my iPhone 6s to iOS 10 yesterday. I eventually noticed that somehow, JavaScript had been disabled in the Safari settings. Furthermore, the control itself is disabled!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S4jre.jpg" width="375"  Why might javascript be permanently disabled? How can I re-enable it?  It obviously makes it difficult to debug javascript when it's disabled on my debug device.  <answer253022> I had a similar issue, iOS 10 on a 6s, my JavaScript control was greyed out, but was stuck in the on position. However, JavaScript was not working, the browser was acting just as if java was off.  I did absolutely nothing, looked at it last night right before I went to sleep. This morning, I opened safari, noticed that google searches loooked different, checked the setting again and it is no longer greyed out, and JavaScript is now enabled and working fine. I didn't do anything to make this happen. No power cycles, sw updates, nothing.  Very confusing   <answer253146> I've discovered mine had this issue due to my corporate email app restricting JavaScript on safari, post update   <comment315953> This seems to have been it - polling around the office, those with the device management software installed and who are on iOS 10 have the same issue. I suspect the iOS 10 update caused the issue. Taking it up with IT. Thanks!
