How to disable onscreen notifications in OSX? <body> OSX uses semi-transparent on-screen notifications for some system events, such as screen brightness and volume adjustment, and Bluetooth connection notifications. This notification will be visible for a brief moment at the lower middle of the screen.  Is there a way to disable these notifications?  <comment319046> What OS version are you using? <comment319476> El Capitan (10.11.6) and latest macOS Sierra. The same on-screen notification scheme is used in both.
