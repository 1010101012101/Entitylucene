Delete CoreStorage Volume even as OS X won't acknowledge there is one? <body> I installed Yosemite on an external 3TB drive. I made a specific 300GB partition on it to hold the system and a second for data. Installation worked fine. However, according to Disk Utility in both Mavericks and Yosemite there is only a little more than 800GB available on the whole disk.  When I run codediskutil list; echo; diskutil cs list/code it says there are no CoreStorage Volumes, but I knew from the Yosemite installation that there is one.  How can I get rid of the CoreStorage Volume even as OS X won't acknowledge there is one? Do I dare to delete and erase the complete drive from Disk Utility in Mavericks? It seems risky as it can't even show me the lost partition space.  Here's the output:  precode/dev/disk2 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER         0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *801.6 GB   disk2 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1 2:                  Apple_HFS X Drive                 320.1 GB   disk2s2 3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk2s3  No CoreStorage logical volume groups found /code/pre  <answer156797> I ran the command codecat /dev/random &gt; /dev/disk2/code as user "su" and all partitions are gone now. At first, the available disk space was still only 801GB. After a while it showed up properly in Disk Utility as 3.0TB though and I was able to reformat it. Excellent!  Thanks to Topher Kessler for posting the proper commands in How to fix deep formatting problems with OS X drives!  CoreStorage is great technology. Apple info still leaves a lot to be desired.
