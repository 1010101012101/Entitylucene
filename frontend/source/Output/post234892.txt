CPU System agent core (TC0E/TC0F) running very high <body> When my MBP (Retina, 13", Early 2015, identifier MacBookPro12,1) is under load, could either be CPU load or "bus-load", ie wifi, usb, webcam etc the codeCPU System Agent Core/code-sensor shows a very high temperature. The SMC-key is either codeTC0E/code or codeTC0F/code (ie Tango Charlie Zero Echo / Foxtrot). With very high temperature I mean 90C+, and I start to get bus errors here.  I believe this is either due to faulty SMC cooling "instructions" or bad application of coolant paste. I'm leaning towards bad application of coolant paste.   Is there any way I could easily check this? I guess I would void warranty by actually opening the MBP?  If you want to test your temperatures compared to mine:  precode-- At first, get homebrew, see instructions at http://brew.sh -- after installing run &gt; brew cask install istat-menus -- thereafter -- scan for all sensors &gt; istats -scan -- add the two which go high for me to default set &gt; istats add TC0E &gt; istats add TC0F -- check default + added sensors &gt; istats /code/pre  <answer235093> ol liI would do a SMC reset (google on apple)/li liIn addition to iStat, i have Macs Fan Control./li lijust use iStat to DISPLAY fan speed and CPU gfx core temp/li liUse Macs Fan Control, MFC, to control fan speed.

I use a hard shell case from iPearl (search on Amazon... our model is A1502).  Its got little legs I can prop up the rear of my mbp, to keep it cooler.  Fits well, no issues here, I am typing on it right now.  mbp 13" retina 12,1 blah blah,   ~1900 rpm, 35C  As far as CPU System agent core on my mbp, iStat will report it to be 0 at times, then it'll resume back to normal in a sec or two.  Let me know if u figure out that one.  thx.
