Why  can't I open a subfolder from a stack in my Dock? <body> I have the application folder as a stack in my Dock, when I click it and then click on strongUtilities`/strong, the stack just disappears, but when I click it a strongemsecond time/em/strong, then it works.  What could be the problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tQa1I.png" alt="mac os lion dock stack"  <comment30357> How are you trying to open the folder? From a Finder window? If so, what view mode (column, list, etc)?
