Replace Demo content with fully functional one <body> So I have iPhone 5c ME561LP/A with demo content. Can I replace the demo content with fully functional iOS?  <answer247288> Probably, all you should have to do is wipe and restore it to the latest iOS version via iTunes:     h2Use iTunes on your Mac or PC to restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to factory settings/h2      A factory restore erases the information and settings on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod and installs the latest iOS or iPod software.    <comment305366> That worked like a charm :)
