MacBook Pro Serial Number Not Available <body> Today, I opened up an application to see check how my battery is going along, health, etc. It said that my Mac had an unknown manufacture date and no serial. I opened up About This Mac, and saw that for some reason, it says my serial number is "Unavailable", and it doesn't show the exact model of my mac (It just shows "MacBook Pro" instead of "MacBook Pro, Retina Late 2013" like it used to, even when I click on it)  I do have the serial number written down, and checked my warranty with Apple. I do have a valid purchase date, and Apple Care for 1 more year.   I have had the display replaced under warranty a few months ago, but I am pretty sure that that did not do it.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DljH8.png" alt="About This Mac Info"  <answer244622> Is there any chance that Apple replaced the main logic board when they replaced the display?  Since you still have AppleCare, I think you should ask apple to fix this.   <comment301459> see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/77482/what-causes-a-mac-to-lose-its-serial-number <comment301460> I have checked it out, it kind of does affect me, as all of my iMessages are now gone, I can't run a hardware test, etc. <comment301469> No, the logic board has not been replaced, only the display. I think if I have more issues with not having a serial number then I'll take it to apple. At the moment, I can't boot into a hardware test, and all my iMessages are gone
