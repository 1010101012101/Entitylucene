Macports issues after Mountain Lion upgrade <body> After upgrading Lion to emMountain Lion/em, the emMacPorts/em system seems broken.  Refering to the emMacPorts/em's migration page, the best solution seems to unistall all and reinstall all the ports.  Is there a simpler/less drastic solution?  <answer59805> Here is how I fix it (after Mountain Lion update):  ul liinstall the latest emMacPorts/em DMG dedicated to Mountain Lion over the old one;/li liinstall the latest emXcode/em version from the emAppStore/em (it doesn't update by itself!);/li lilaunch emXcode/em and agree to the licence;/li liin emXcode/em's emPreferences/em, at the emDownload/em's tab, in the emComponents/em section, install emCommand Line Tools/em (as since Xcode 4.3);/li listrongdon't forget/strong that you must read and accept licence for it, this is possible after running the following command in the terminal: codesudo xcodebuild -license/code. ul liWithout this step, if you try to use codesudo port install [something]/code or others, you'll have the following return: strongError: org.macports.build for port libunwind-headers returned: command execution failed/strong/li /ul/li liin terminal: ul licodesudo port selfupdate/code/li licodesudo port upgrade outdated/code/li /ul/li /ul  After that, everything works except emMongoDB/em, After some research, I found this article (How to upgrade MacPorts to OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion) by Phil Freo.  Thanks to this article, which reassured me in my approach, I also found the solution to my last issue:     Everything finished and worked properly except emMongoDB/em. Currently there is an incompatibility between boost 1.50 and MongoDB which can be resolved with these two commands, assuming boost 1.49 was previously installed on your machine:   ul licodesudo port activate boost @1.49.0_0/code/li licodesudo port -n install mongodb/code/li /ul  <comment69280> The mongodb solution proposed only works if mongodb was already installed prior to installing Mountain Lion. If, on the other hand you wish to install mongodb fresh, this will not help you because the mongodb configurations upgrades boost to 1.5.0 which breaks mongodb! It seems like the only workaround is to wait for the maintainers of the mongodb port to resolve the boost issue. <comment71512> MongoDB issue here: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/35726 <comment73630> Here is the original ticket: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/35118 <comment73632> The ticket for the Boost problem in MongoDB is here: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-4314
