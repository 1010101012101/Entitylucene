iPad Pages: replacing the wood effect theme <body> Is there any way to replace the brown wood-effect toolbars used by Pages on the iPad with something more neutral?  <answer19457> If your device is jailbroken, I assume you can modify files within an app's bundle? I haven't jailbroken my device, so I'm not sure exactly how this works. However, if you have:  Within the Pages bundle, there are images called codeTP_RulerBackground.png/code and codeTP_toolbar_top_bg_norm.png/code. If you replace these files with something else, it'll change the toolbars/rulers.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tPrmN.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FVBqQ.png" alt=""  <comment21453> It's not jailbroken, and in fact it's not my device - it's a family member who I'd have a hard time explaining the concept to. But otherwise that would work. <comment21556> There's really no conceivable other way you would be able to do it. Unless Pages offered a preference for changing the toolbars (which they don't), you'd have to change them yourself, and to do that you'd have to jailbreak.
