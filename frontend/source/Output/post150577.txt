How to disable iOS FaceTime notification sounds? <body> I don't want any sound-based notifications on my iOS device, but I still want the visual alerts.   Most apps (e.g. Messages, Reminders, etc.) have a codeNone/code choice at the top of their list of notification sound options (or at least an codeOn/Off/code switch, e.g. Gmail and Hangouts), but codeSettings / Notifications / FaceTime / Notification Sound/code yields no codenone/code option.   Nothing more regarding notification sounds is listed under codeSettings / FaceTime/code, nor in the app itself (which frustratingly has no in-app settingsâ€”I think the system settings are crowded enough even without adding app settings to them).   Am I missing something?   In the meantime, all I can do (it seems) is disable FaceTime notifications altogether.   2012 iPod Touch 5  iOS 8.0.2  <answer157401> I found this extremely frustrating as well. I spent an hour trying to record a silent ringtone in GarageBand but it consistently delivered noisey ringtones despite no sound on the track. I was about to give up when I thought someone else besides us must have been annoyed and figured it out. A Google search yielded the silent ringtone below. I tried it and it works great. Good luck.  http://www.codingmerc.com/blog/silence-ringtone-available-for-download/  <comment185049> Of course! Quite clever.
