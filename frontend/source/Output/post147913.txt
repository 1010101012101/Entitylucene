64 bit chrome beta OS X 10.9.5 <body> Apparently Chrome Beta for OS X is supposed to be 64 bit. (e.g. http://thenextweb.com/google/2014/08/29/chrome-38-beta-arrives-new-user-switching-profiles-guest-mode-64-bit-default-mac/  I have the latest Chrome beta Version 38.0.2125.77 beta but it is still 32 bit. I have reinstalled.  The dev channel is 64 bit on my Macbook Air (2013).   <answer148067> Downloading this Google Chrome 64-bit version 39.0.2171.2 - you get the correct one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JkNLa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment174556> Yes, I know that the dev channel is 64 bit (see my post). The Chromium blog promises that the beta channel should also be 64 bit, but it's not.
