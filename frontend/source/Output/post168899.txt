Change Safari search suggestions language on iPhone <body> The search suggestions in Safari always suggest results in Dutch to me, despite using my phone in English, and my Google set to English by default.  I am Dutch and live in the Netherlands, so I guess this is intended behaviour, but I find the Dutch wikipedia pages to be lacking quite often, for example.  Is there any way to change this language?  <answer168948> Welcome to the Non-World Wide Web !  In the good old days, search engines respected the principles of the World Wide Web.
