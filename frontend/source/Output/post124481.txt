i tried reseting all of my data on my ipod touch to unjailbreak now stuck black screen after apple logo <body> ok so today i wanted to reset my jailbroken ipod touch 2g because it was having some issues. i went into settings, general, something like reset, then something like reset all data and content. after i pushed that it did the regular loading bar thingy and when it restart, i got the apple logo then a black screen. no loading circle of death, just a sad lightish blue black screen. now, before that, my ipod just went to recovery mode, so i thought, why not rejailbreak it, so i did that and thats how i got it working again. then the whole reset stuff and now this. i have tried just about everything, dfu mode, recovery mode, ipsw restores on both itunes and redsn0w, and when i do that, in redsn0w, when you think things are going good, it brings up a loding bar and does nothing. itunes dows the same. please help. alll ideas are appreciated. thankyou daniel  <answer124487> Put the device into DFU mode and restore it through iTunes.  ol liOpen iTunes and connect the iPhone to your computer./li liPress and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button at the same time./li liAfter exactly 10 seconds release the Sleep/Wake button.
