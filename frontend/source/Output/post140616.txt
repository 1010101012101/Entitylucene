How to make the other person in a call to not hear the sounds my OS X is playing? <body> When I'm on Google Hangouts on OS X Mavericks the person on the other side can listen any sound my computer plays. Since I'm using headphones I don't suppose the actual audio wave is traveling to the microphone, but I think there's a software redirection that makes them hear everything.  How to turn this off?
