Limiting a standard user to use 50 GB of the hard drive <body> I have added a standard user for my brother on my Mac Mini, and I would like to limit the amount of space he can use on my hard drive, but I can't see where I can set this kind of restrictions.  I have read online that you can set it from accounts; however, I can't see any option there. The only options I can see are checkboxes to allow the user to administer the computer, and to enable parental controls.  Does anyone know where I can set this?  <answer25220> This should work for you:    ol liCreate a root shell session in Terminal with codesudo -s/code, providing your admin password when asked./li liCreate an empty quota options file with codetouch /.quota.ops.user/code/li liRun codequotacheck -a/code to generate a list of drive space used by user/li liRun coderepquota -a/code to list the drive space used by each user/li liEnable quotas by typing codequotaon //code (You can turn them off again with codequotaoff //code )/li liSet quota limits for a given use by typing codeedquota -u username/codebr This will put you in a codevi/code editing session, where you can set both hard and soft limits on drive space and inodes (files).br Note: codevi/code is a text editor and can be a bit of a handful to use if you're not used to it, try searching for a basic tutorial on the net if you've never used it before. /li /ol  You'll get a file that looks like this:    precodeQuotas for user fakeuser: /: 1K blocks in use: 14968, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)         inodes in use: 224, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)   /code/pre  The soft limit can be exceeded for one file, allowing users to save a file which puts them over their limit but not allow them to save any more until they get back under their limit.  Hard limits cannot be exceeded though.    <comment28468> I think this article should cover it: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090202064037457 <comment28469> A longer explanation with examples can be [found here](http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20017465-263.html).
