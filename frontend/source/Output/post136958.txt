omnigraffle Keyboard shortcuts missing <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gr0zS.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have been trying to adjust the keyboard shortcuts for omnigraffle and for some reason they are completely gone. I am really not sure how this happened but I can not get my zoom keys to work. This is driving me nuts. Any ideas how to fix this?  The docs at omnigraffle show they should be there.  Help?  <answer136962> From https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/keyboard-shortcuts-missing/6295/2...     Try using ⇧⌘&lt; and ⇧⌘. Some, but not all, keyboards require the use of the shift key to get the greater-than and less-than symbols.   <comment162609> assuming you did not have the 14 days trial version? if not can you add it again using the + sign? <comment162611> @Buscar How would the trial version of OmniGraffle affect this? <comment162613> I have the full version.  I just heard from Omnigraffle https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/keyboard-shortcuts-missing/6295 they are located somewhere else.  They cmd+ keys do not work. :( Thoughts?
