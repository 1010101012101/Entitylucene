Possible to get Messages to open tel: links? <body> Links that use the tel: protocol open in FaceTime by default on Macs. If, like me, you prefer to text/iMessage rather than call, it would be nice to have them open in Messages by default. I was able to use RCDefaultApp to set Messages to the handler for tel: links but it doesn't open a new message to that number, just launches Messages. Anyone know if there's a way to get it to work with AppleScript or something?
