Is it possible to set the JAVA_HOME env in El Captitan? <body> I am unable to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable osx. I added the following line to my code.bash_profile/code  precodeexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home` /code/pre  and sourced it afterwards; yet when I printenv or attempt to echo it, I see nothing in Terminal.  <answer221245> The only way I got this to work was by setting this environment variable in the code.bashrc/code file, which incidentally, isn't created in the users home directory by default. Thanks to patrix's comments on my question which led to this solution.  <answer221345> I think you should remove the backticks (`) and do something like:  precodeexport JAVA_HOME="/usr/libexec/java_home" /code/pre  <comment267887> Does setting other variables in `.bashrc` work as expected? Does running `/usr/libexec/java_home` work? <comment267888> Did you start a new shell? <comment267889> Running /usr/libexec/java_home worked. It also turns out that setting the environment variable in this file (.bashrc) works but not in the .bash_profile. I didn't have the .bashrc file in my home folder so I guess this has to be created.
