App Store Updates not working <body> I'm running Mavericks (10.9.5) and it has been working without problems for months. Recently I can't install updates from the App Store. Since today, the App Store doesn't even show icons anymore. Also, when I open the iTunes store, almost no icons for store products (music, podcasts, etc.) are shown.  I've tried logging out of my account, restarting, etc. but to no avail. I'm seeing these error messages when I look in the console application:  When opening App Store:  precodecom.apple.WebKit.WebContent: NSScanner: nil string argument (multiple times) /code/pre  When trying to install an update:  precodecom.apple.WebKit.WebContent[709]: ERROR: ITSExceptionHandler: {message:"TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'document.querySelector("#header").addClassName')", url:"https://se.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/0414/da-storefront-autoinstallations.js", lineNumber:"361"} /code/pre  When opening iTunes:  precodeiTunes: Failed to create replacement string (multiple times) iTunes: ApplePushService: APSConnection being used without a delegate queue /code/pre  This happens on a Macbook Air (Mid 2011). I have a second notebook (Macbook Pro, Mid 2012), everything works fine there.  UPDATE: I tried reinstalling Mavericks using the Recovery-Volume, after downloading it runs for approx. 30 minutes, then stops without having reinstalled. This is very weird!  Any ideas on what could be the reason for all this? Where can I continue digging?  <answer151270> First things I'd do would be  ol liRun Disk Utility, check permissions &amp; verify/repair disk/li liGrab the combo updater for 10.9.5 &amp; re-install http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1760/li /ol  <answer228470> You can try open the Terminal and this command :  precodekillall softwareupdated /code/pre  Then go with the Finder to Maj+CMD+ G : /Library/Updates and delete "index.plist" and "ProductMetadata.plist".  Then manually update app Store with this command :  precodesoftwareupdate -i /code/pre  <comment177984> Thanks. Tried both, still the same problem... :( <comment178018> Couldn't even reinstall without erasing startup volume... Which is what I've done now. Thanks anyway!
