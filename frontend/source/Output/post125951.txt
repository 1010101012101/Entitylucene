How do I change the default gmail calendar on my iphone 4? <body> I have three calendars in my gmail (one for me and my two kids). When I add an appointment on my iphone, it defaults to my son's calendar unless I manually check my calendar every single time.  <answer125952> Go to strongSettings/strong-strongMail, Contact, Calendars/strong. Scroll to the strongCALENDARS/strong section. There you will find the option: strongDefault Calendar/strong. Change that to the one you want to be default.  <comment147447> what app are you adding the appointment to? The built in Calendar?
