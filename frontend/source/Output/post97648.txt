In Chrome: Deleting the first character of a line, `\n` is also deleted, can that be changed? <body> In a textarea box in Chrome, I write:     a   codea/code is at line head and there a empty line before codea/code, and I press codedelete/code key to remove codea/code. Not noly codea/code was removed, but also the newline code\n/code is removed too, which is supposed to remove a single character here (for Linux users).  hr  I didn't noticed that, it works fine in Safari.  <comment114598> Can you please add some details like which application you are using, which keys you press and what the difference between the expected and the observed result is? <comment114603> @patrix I added some lines here, hope it better explained now. <comment114618> I thought it might be caused by smart copy and paste or other substitutions, but I couldn't reproduce it. The key that is called delete on other platforms is called forward delete on OS X, and the key that is called backspace on other platforms is called delete on OS X. <comment114635> @patrix I even thought that was designed by OS X by default. Then there should be a solution. I'll try looking for it.
