How to enable CTRL+4/5/6? <body> On Mountain Lion 10.8.2, when I use the Keyboard Viewer, I can see that kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd1/kbd, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd2/kbd, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd3/kbd register correctly when I type them.  kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd4/kbd or kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd5/kbd however, only show the kbdCtrl/kbd key being hit and the numbers ignored.  strongHow can I enable all the kbdCtrl/kbd+code#/code keys?/strong  I don't really need them for spaces - rather, I need all the keys available for SC2 (FWIW, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd1/kbd, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd2/kbd, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd3/kbd work fine in SC2, but the higher numbers don't).  <answer110251> I had a similar issue of unresponsive kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd3/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd4/kbd keystrokes using OS X 10.8.4 and found a solution that worked for me using information from this answer.  ol liOpen code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/code (I used XCode)./li liUpdate keys for the shortcuts which are giving you trouble by switching codeenabled/code to codeNO/code. I switched code120/code and code121/code, which represent kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd3/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd4/kbd. I am not sure about kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd5/kbd or kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd6/kbd./li liRestart your computer./li /ol  Hope this helps!  <comment107562> That's very strange. FWIW all those key combos work fine for me on 10.8.3. Did you check to see if the 4 and 5 keys register without modifiers?
