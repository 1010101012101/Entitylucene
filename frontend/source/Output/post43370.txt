Is there a way to only enable automatic graphics switching when on battery power? <body> It is rare when I use my MBP on battery power. But is there a way to only enable strongautomatic graphics switching/strong when on battery power?     <answer43372> You can try an application called "gfxCardStatus" :)  <answer87416> "is there a way to only enable automatic graphics switching when on battery power?"  Yes.  Go to System Preferences - Energy Saver  There are two tabs at the top of the window; one for battery and one for AC power.   Set the graphics switching option by checking or un-checking "Automatic Graphics Switching" in those tabs.  <comment49287> Take a look at [can i force gpu rendering on my mbp when connected to a power source](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/40423/can-i-force-gpu-rendering-on-my-mbp-when-connected-to-a-power-source/40425#40425). Its similar (but not the same) so might help <comment179364> Not anymore; gfxCardStatus has removed that feature. <comment179365> Sure, but the "Automatic Graphics Switching" checkbox is outside, meaning that it's a global setting. <comment317965> This answer is inaccurate.  No reason to keep it.
