Just bought iPad mini 4 and have updated to ios 10, now not accepting correct password for home network <body> After updating my new iPad to iOS 10, it will not connect to my home network. If I go outside of my home, the iPad will connect to other networks, but not my home network.  I have tried resetting/rebooting the modem, have reset my network settings, turned off location services, tried turning off then turning on my WiFi on the iPad, and nothing is working.  No matter what, it always says the correct password is wrong. I use the same password to connect my Chromebook to the network and it works just fine.    If anyone has any answers or suggestions, I thank you in advance.
