Is it possible to define the width/height of a Terminal window with this command: osascript -e \'tell application "Terminal" to do script <body> I am using this command to do some magic for my personal use:  precodeosascript -e \'tell application "Terminal" to do script /code/pre  Is it possible to precisely define the width and height of the popup Terminal window?  If not, is there anyway I can do it after it's opened? (Precisely adjust its size value)  <answer266429> Open a Terminal window and position it on the screen where you want it and resize it to the size you want.  Then in Terminal, execute the following emcommand/em:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to get bounds of front window' /code/pre  It will return a four-item list of integers, e.g:  precode0, 22, 730, 531 /code/pre  Now move the Terminal window to a different position on the screen and resize it.  Then in Terminal, execute the following emcommand/em, while substituting the actual list returned from the codeget bounds/code emcommand/em, e.g:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to set bounds of front window to {0, 22, 730, 531}' /code/pre  You'll see that the window gets repositioned and resized to what it was when you ran the codeget bounds/code emcommand/em.  <comment334062> Thanks for your answer! Is it possible to resize any other Application in this way? (For example, a Safari window) <comment334068> @Aw Qirui Guo, Yes, just substitute the applications name, e.g. `osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to set bounds of front window to {0, 22, 730, 531}'`
