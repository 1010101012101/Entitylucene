freezes and hangs in macbook pro <body> i have a 2009 macbook pro. it has been working fine till now. since the past 2 weeks when i open an application or browse the net it freezes. i see a message saying waiting for cache or waiting for Appcache. this happens almost every 5 minutes.   any ideas on how i can stop this and get my macbook back to normal?  can third party apps like mackeeper resolve this? anyone out there with a similar issue that has used it?  <answer137137> Is the waiting for cache message showing up in Google Chrome? If that is the case, then yes, that's a pretty common issue with Chrome itself not specific to OS X. I've had that issue a number of times and have yet to find any way to resolve it apart from a full wipe of the application.   As for the other applications you are talking about, are there some specific applications that freeze, or all apps in general? A screenshot of your Activity Monitor would be ver helpful.  <comment162873> what os x are you using? <comment162875> There are 2 tools on your Mac you can use to find the source. The Activity monitor, and the Console. Both are in your utility folder. Open and look what is going on. <comment162886> This belongs in the comment section not as a answer.
