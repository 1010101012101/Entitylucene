PDFs showing blank pages in all apps on El Capitan <body> Hey I'm having an issue where if I open PDFs then sometimes the last few pages are just totally blank. Then sometimes it doesn't display any of the pages at all, and sometimes it works fine. I can't seem to find any reason this might be happening, I've tried a few different PDFs and it just seems random. Eventually the PDF does sometimes display properly, but only after a few minute. It happens intermittently on both Preview and Skim, but emdoesn't/em happen on the spacebar finder preview, which emalways/em displays it fine.  Here is an example. You can see that the table of contents in the sidebar are also "greyed out".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nuZAV.png" alt="Preview broken PDF"  Here is the the same PDF in Skim. Showing all but the last few pages as working.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rDgEh.png" alt="Skim broken PDF"  I've tried restarting and it didn't change anything.  Running El Capitan 10.11.1 (15B42)  <comment260744> What are your results with Acrobat Reader DC? Are there error messages?
