How to hide an app from the Launchpad? <body> Is there any way to hide an app from the Launchpad in Yosemite? I don't want to delete it or something like that I just want to hide apps that I don't use frequently, and I have a lot of them, putting them in a folder that I ignore makes the Launchpad slow to process, any solution to get rid of them without deleting them?  <answer158839> If you feel that your Launchpad is filled with apps, you can make folders in Launchpad by moving a app over another app.  How to do this shown at wikihow, this is done in Mac OS X Lion, but will work in Yosemite.  What the content of link describes is how to make folders in Launchpad, this is easily done by moving an app (inside Launchpad) over another app. This will make a folder with both apps in it.  <answer250044> Just Move them out of the Applications Folder. Copy an app from the Applications folder and paste it in a folder like Downloads or Documents.

Is moving them to another directory an option for you? <comment269866> Does it cause no problems to move Apps from /Applications <comment309247> I had problems (with Lion) which kept showing old apps (in other partitions). My solution was to Trash the Launchpad db and restart. OS X will recreate the database. <comment310325> Images are best linked directly [SE uses its own sub-domain at imgur for this] rather than from somewhere like dropbox, where they can vanish later. I've inlined the first two for you, using different methods, so you can see how it's possible to either directly inline via drag & drop, or use html to reduce the apparent size without altering the actual image [2nd way requires drag & drop first, then a re-edit to change to html] <comment310398> This doesn't work at all for me. Moving, duplicating, Launchpad still keeps the pointer to the file in place. Are you doing some manual clearing of the launch database? <comment310564> @bmike did you try to reboot? <comment310579> Yes  @RubatharisanThirumathyam - tried it on several machines. 10.11 and 10.12 - launch database finds apps in user home folders as well as desktop and /Applications for me. <comment310652> @bmike, I have no idea why it's not working for you - I don't really use the launchpad, spotlight is 100 times faster for me than finding the app in Launchpad :)
