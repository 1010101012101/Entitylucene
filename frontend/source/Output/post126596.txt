skill -KILL -u $user Command on Max OS X? <body> Is there an alternative for the codeskill -KILL -u $user/code command on the Mac OSx. The basic requirement is I want to log out my current logged in user at end of shell script  This program logs out Linux log in user .  <answer126599> From the man page of codeskill/code     These tools are obsolete and unportable.  The command syntax is poorly defined. Consider using the killall, pkill, and pgrep commands instead.   so you could use codepkill -KILL -u uid/code.  But why kill every process with the KILL signal? You can just call codeexit/code after your script:  precodescript.sh ; exit /code/pre  <comment148320> I think you left a `k` out of `pkill` <comment148321> @dwightk Thanks :-) Edited. <comment148333> Do you want to log out/exit from the shell you are running in or log out the user from Finder? <comment148468> The above command is not working in OS X 10.9 :( <comment148732> @prateeakojha the pkill command? Do you get an error message? What are you exactly doing?
