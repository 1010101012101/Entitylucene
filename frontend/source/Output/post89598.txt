iPhone 5 battery unused for 2 month <body> I would like to know if there is a risk for my iPhone 5 battery after remaining 2 months unused and uncharged. I'm going to re-use my iPhone, and I wonder if it stills usable for daily uses.  Any feedback from some user who encounter the same situation ?  Thanks.
