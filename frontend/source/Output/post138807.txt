How to invert screen colors and color hue? <body> I want to "smart invert" my colors like this app does: http://arcanesanctum.net/negativescreen/  I tried the app called "Nocturne 2.0.0" but its "Invert Hue" option has no effect because of this issue: https://code.google.com/p/blacktree-nocturne/issues/detail?id=63  Is there a way to do this?  I am using Mavericks 10.9.2 on MBP2011  <answer138812> If you can create or find an appropriatey inverted ICC profile, this can be used to invert your colours.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/deH36.jpg" alt="Display colour profile"  See White on black without inverting colors? for more about how the display's colours can be manipulated.
