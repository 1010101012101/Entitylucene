Does iCloud block access from Private Internet Access VPN IP's <body> I recently started using PIA VPN services on my Mac.  Everything seemed great until this weekend when I started having iCloud issues.  The error I received indicate that the account had been locked due to security reasons.  So I reset the password and found I still couldn't access iCloud.  I then found that I was unable to log into iCloud until I disabled my PIA VPN, then everything worked fine.  Is this a new issue?  Has anyone else experienced this?  <comment356801> Your PIA could block albert.apple.com, which may result in the blocking of all apple websites, especially icloud and activation servers.
