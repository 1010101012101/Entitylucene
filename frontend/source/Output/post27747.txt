How can I change the colors of calendars on iOS5 <body> Supposedly, you can change the colors of calendars from the iPhone now. How!? (In particular, I'm trying to do it for google calendars synced via exchange, but I can't see how to do it with iCloud ones, either.)  <answer27749> You can do this in the Calendar app.  1) Tap strongCalendars/strong in the upper left corner:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8l5k.png" alt="Calendars button"  2) Then tap strongEdit/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5fqjG.png" alt="Edit button"  3) Select the calendar you want to change the colour of:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ElTJK.png" alt="Calendar selection"  4) Pick the colour you want. If you want a more extensive selection than what's in the list, you need to do it from iCal on your Mac.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NIsDU.png" alt="Colour picker"  <comment41044> Thanks for the hint, but this only works with iCloud calendars... Google calendar colors cannot be changed this way... <comment42671> I am not sure why this did not work for @endelight (so this may not apply to them), but I have two Google Calendars. One was added manually, the other via a profile (by the iPhone Configuration Utility from Apple).  The one that I added manually, I can change the color on, the one that was done via the profile I can't. I am guessing because it is in a profile, it is locked down. <comment48383> @JimJan same problem here <comment85658> As a historical note - on iOS 4 - it was very hard to manage the colors of multiple calendars on multiple devices. On iOS 5 it got better since you could change things by hand. I haven't heard of it being an issue on iOS 6.
