Not getting OS X El Capitan Public Beta updates <body> I'm registered for getting Public Beta updates, but in the last 4-5 months, I'm not receiving any updates in the Mac App Store.  I'm currently on 10.11 Beta (15A278b).  <answer242013> Go to System Preferences → App Store and ensure ‘your computer is set to receive beta updates’.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gE74w.png" alt=""  <comment297485> Are you signed in with your Apple ID on the computer? <comment297516> Is it just 10.11? Or are you on 10.11.X? If 10.11, apple isn't providing public beta's for that version. If on 10.11.X, grgarside answer is correct <comment297966> I checked but there's no option for 'beta software updates' on System Preferences/App Store.[You can see here](https://jumpshare.com/v/Y2tfSFrtRiltOK6XEUSt) <comment297967> @Angelplayer Yes, I'm signed in with my Apple ID. <comment297968> @Jules I've also mentioned the build. I'm on OS X 10.11 (15A278b). <comment297970> @Satyajeet I would try to re-register with the public beta program then
