Nervous Cursor on 2013 MacBook Pro 15" Retina <body> While I try to get some writing done on my MacBook Pro 15" Retina (first under Mountain Lion and now Mavericks) the cursor will often jump randomly away from where I'm typing to another location in the text. Read somewhere that switching off BlueTooth would help prevent these annoying twitches, but that simply does not seem true: the cursor still jumps unexpectedly especially at higher touch-typing speeds. Is there a known cure for this flaw? It sure plays havoc with productivity. Grrr.  <answer120728> Does it jump around randomly everywhere, both desktop and applications, or is it only when you type? Mine jumped around everywhere several times, but every time it stopped after I cleaned the trackpad thoroughly. Also dust can get trapped at the border, so push down and clean as good as you can (beware of using too much water of course).  <comment140741> Have you taken the laptop to a repair depot or Apple Store? It sounds like you might have a problem with the trackpad. <comment140877> Only when I type, and only inside the text already written.
