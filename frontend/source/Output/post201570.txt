Running 10.11 in VM Ware Fusion with 10.10 Host <body> I run 10.11 public beta in a VM with VMware Fusion 7.1.2 with my rMBP 2015. I have the problem that main part in Finder or the maps in Maps.app are blank. Sidebars and menus are all rendering fine. Is this a known issue? Can I do something about this?  <answer201573> El Capitan is a beta software and VMware Fusion 7.1.2 doesn't support El Capitan officially.  Just download and install VMware Fusion Technology Preview 2015 and try your luck.  Improvements among others:  ul liNew OS Support including Windows 10 Insider Preview and El Capitan Beta/li liDirectX 10 and OpenGL 3.3 Support/li /ul  <comment243004> I presume you mean 10.11 & 10.10 host? <comment243007> Yes, you a right! Fixed it.
