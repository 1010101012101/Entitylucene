How can I uninstall Oracle Java 7.51 on OSX Mavericks or go back to an earlier version of Java? <body> I have a MacBook Pro with OSX Mavericks. I had my automatic update switched on for Java (unfortunately). So when I was asked if I want to update I naturally said yes.  With the update I am having problems opening Java operated websites. I am getting failure messages. This is since the update.  I found a website where there are instructions: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5559?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  I'm not sure this is right for my purposes.   Also when I copied the first row of instructions into the terminal window (as per the instructions given on the above website) the system asked me to type my password. I tried writing it in but I was unable to type my password no matter how many times I tried. As far as I know I have administrative rights. If I don't I don't know where to set it.  Could someone please help me. I'm new to Mac and I'm not very good with "tech talk" either. Also my software is in Hungarian which makes it a bit more difficult for me. So if some one could explain to me as simply as possible I'd appreciate it.  Thanks, Gabi   <comment141570> The sudo command should just ask for your password and just work - try `sudo ls` to see if sudo works <comment141788> Hi, In the meantime my problem is solved. I called Apple for help. But thank you anyway for your kind help. <comment141794> What was the solution so we can help others <comment142017> Hi, I didn't have to use the terminal window for I didn't need to uninstall java to get to an earlier version. As mentioned I couldn't open Java operated windows. So I was <comment142018> Hi, In the end I didn't have to use the terminal window at all for I didn't need to uninstall java to get to an earlier version. As mentioned I couldn't open Java operated websites. So I was told to open the Java Control Panel within the settings window, then to open  the Security Tab where I had to adjust the security level to medium (this is the lowest security). By making this adjustment I was then able to open Java operated sites. It seems that when I updated to the latest version it automatically set my security level to maximum level. By the way what is sudo command??? <comment142024> The command that the web site asked you to run - first note if you do not know what sudo does do not run it - that is true for all terminal commands but especially sudo - unknown commands could delete all your disk etc, so you have to have at least an idea of what any command will do <comment142025> Please write up your solution as an answer <comment142186> I haven't used sudo because there was no need - as I found out. and I probably will not use it in future without outside help.  And thank you for the info :))
