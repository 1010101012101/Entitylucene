When I close my MacBook - my Ultrafine 4K display stays on (I want everything to sleep) <body> When I close my MacBook - my Ultrafine 4K display stays on (I want everything to sleep). It's connected via USB-C.  I can find nothing about this on Google - in fact I found articles telling people what to do to make an external display emstay on/em (like it goes off by default).  Mine stays on by default - when I have stopped using the MacBook and want to step away from my machine - I just want to close it, have the machine sleep &amp; monitor go off and be done. How can I do this?  <answer284208> This is normal closed clamshell mode for the MacBook so you would need to script a sleep event or to sleep your display:  Control–Shift–Power button or  Control–Shift–Media Eject - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236  You can make use of normal lock timeouts for screen sleeping, power savings and locking.   <comment358387> Does it go into *standby* mode or does it just stay in full power mode?
