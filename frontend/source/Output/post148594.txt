Mavericks 802.1X .mobileconfig & certificate authentication? <body> We are using 802.1X connection with "local" certificate at our dormitory. It has been working all well with Moutain Lion, but after upgrading to Mavericks, it just stopped working. The message is: codeAuthentication failed on 802.1X network. The identity of the authentication server could not be established.  Contact your network administrator to verify your configuration settings./code One thing that I noticed is that apple introduced new app for creating .mobileconfig files, Apple Configurator with Mavericks instead of old iPhone Configuration Utility. Before on Lion, and Mountain Lion there was single .mobileconfig file which contained certificate and wifi setting with TTLS, name password. In Mavericks, the Apple configurator generates roughly the same .mobileconfig file, but when I try to connect it just write: codeAuthentication failed on 802.1X network. The identity of the authentication server could not be established./code Can somebody help me with this?  Our network adminstrator is not experienced at all with Mac OS X so my only hope lies here, thank you for any suggestions!
