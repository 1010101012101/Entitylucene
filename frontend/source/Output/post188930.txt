Why are there empty circles next to these voice memos in itunes? <body> I am having a problem finding voice recordings in my iPad. I already had this problem on my phone and none of the blogs nor threads on Apple's site have worked.   I upgraded to iTunes 12.1.2.27  On my iPhone I already did a sync with voice memos. Ever since I put to import audio files as mp3 there is nothing showing up. Just these empty circles  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wh2ax.png" alt="enter image description here"  So i used the voice recorder app on my iPad and now in my iTunes I don't see anything that I can even play. Nor do I even know what those circles are.  <comment224036> The empty circle means the file should be in the process of syncing, or is supposed to have synced but did not for some reason. <comment224306> I tried syncing it at least 5 times. I even got a message that it went through fine. Yet I see these. I updated iTunes to make sure it was not an old bug, but sill having this issue.
