OS X Mavericks lost my mail folders! <body> After loading Mavericks it appears one of my mail folders, a key folder holding tax data has become completely borked.  As you can see from the attached image I have duplicate home folders.  I have already tried to rebuild this folder with no luck.  Any other ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VYAsX.png" alt=".mbox list"  Posted @ Apple:br https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5494468  <answer122597> Rule of thumb, use Time Capsule = Problem Solved.  I ended up migrated to Fastmail.fm = Away from Google.  <comment125767> No backups I assume? Are you using IMAP or POP3? <comment125769> I have backups, but I assumed I could merge them. is that not possible? <comment129656> Previously, the only way to get even your own current mail folders / boxes back into Mail was to Import, one by one. Then Move the emails into the appropriate folders/mailboxes. Perhaps that still works.
