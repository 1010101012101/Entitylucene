Database for iPad <body> I'm a retired teacher using strongFileMakerPro5/strong which was licensed for us by the Ministry of Education here in Ontario.  I've created a little journal program for myself and thought I might like to be able to sync it with my ipad without it costing an arm and a leg or requiring that I learn a whole new database program.  Would the free strongFileMaker Go/strong be too complicated a process to use?  <comment215834> Just a guess, since both apps are made by same company for same purpose, I would venture to say the basic user interaction is the same.
