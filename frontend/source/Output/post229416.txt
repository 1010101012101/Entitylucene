How can I change an NTFS Volume UUID? <body> I just upgraded my Mac to Mac OS X El Capitan and I wanted to update my Windows 7 to Windows 10. But, before that, I need to make a backup of my Windows partition.  As I've done it before, I have a Windows (NTFS) partition on a backup HDD.  The thing is, I want to make a new backup with Carbon Copy Cloner, but it tell's me it can't be done because there are two volumes with same UUID.  OK, then, I fight with my Windows backup partition to have it a different UUID from the one I got for my "local" Windows partition... and I'm loosing the fight !  I have this when using codediskutil info /dev/disk0s2/code :  precode   Device Identifier:        disk0s2    Device Node:              /dev/disk0s2    Whole:                    No    Part of Whole:            disk0    Device / Media Name:      Windows_NTFS_Untitled_3     Volume Name:              Win     Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Volumes/Win     File System Personality:  NTFS    Type (Bundle):            ntfs    Name (User Visible):      Windows NT File System (NTFS)     Partition Type:           Microsoft Basic Data    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 SATA    SMART Status:             Verified    Volume UUID:              24D65D1E-43E8-4FF0-BBBF-A82CC6B45D20    Disk / Partition UUID:    D5C23E74-E658-45E1-B9B3-44681D0D02C2     Total Size:               85.0 GB (84999667712 Bytes) (exactly 166014976 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        34.1 GB (34093342720 Bytes) (exactly 66588560 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes    Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         No     Device Location:          Internal    Removable Media:          No     Solid State:              No /code/pre  ... and I have this using codediskutil info /dev/disk1s4/code :  precode   Device Identifier:        disk1s4    Device Node:              /dev/disk1s4    Whole:                    No    Part of Whole:            disk1    Device / Media Name:      WindowsB     Volume Name:              Windows     Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Volumes/Windows     File System Personality:  NTFS    Type (Bundle):            ntfs    Name (User Visible):      Windows NT File System (NTFS)     Partition Type:           Microsoft Basic Data    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 USB    SMART Status:             Not Supported    Volume UUID:              24D65D1E-43E8-4FF0-BBBF-A82CC6B45D20    Disk / Partition UUID:    C8E2A2D5-6065-4903-8BB6-AC02698323A6     Total Size:               84.7 GB (84655734784 Bytes) (exactly 165343232 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        44.0 GB (44012474368 Bytes) (exactly 85961864 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes    Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         No     Device Location:          External    Removable Media:          No /code/pre  As you can see, the "Disk / Partition UUID" is different, but not the "Volume UUID".  Does anybody have a solution to change the "Volume UUID"?  <answer229447> Usually NTFS volumes don't contain UUIDs. The visible UUID in emdiskutil/em is derived from the NTFS Volume Serial Number.  Get the disk identifier of your backup disk and the volume:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  Unmount the external disk:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk1 /code/pre  Copy the NTFS superblock:  precodesudo dd if=/dev/disk1s4 of=~/Desktop/superblock bs=512 count=1 /code/pre  Change the mod bits:  precodesudo chmod 777 ~/Desktop/superblock  /code/pre  Create a backup of the superblock (just in case!):  precodecp ~/Desktop/superblock ~/Desktop/superblock.backup /code/pre  Modify the file emsuperblock/em with HexFiend:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcMXJ.png" alt="Hexfiend superblock"  The NTFS volume serial number is highlighted in violet (eight bytes beginning at offset 72 or 0x48). Modify at least one byte. After saving the file check the size which should still be 512 Bytes.  Write back the superblock:  precodesudo dd if=~/Desktop/superblock of=/dev/disk1s4 bs=512 count=1 /code/pre  Reboot your Mac and verify the new UUID of disk1s4.  <answer257486> You can simply change UUID by partition format/erase.  1) Format disk to Mac OS Extended using built-in Disk Utility  2) If you need windows partition, format disk to exFAT after you have done first step (for some reason you need two steps for windows partition)  You can check if UUID changed by listing all UUID numbers:  precodefind /Volumes -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -exec diskutil info {} \; /code/pre  <answer275659> On an NTFS partition the UUID is approximately 3352 bytessup[1]/sup from the beginning of the MFT, to find the offset of the MFT it is necessary to read the 8 bytes which start from the 48 byte of the beginning of the partition, These 8 bytes once converted will give the offset of the sector where the MFT begins. To get the offset of the MFT the 8 bytes converted must be multiplied by the number of bytes per sector (512) and the number of sectors per clusters (8) (8 and 512 are the default values ​​for an NTFS partition).   For example, the 8 bytes starting at the 48th (in reading it is two characters per one byte) may be 0x698c670000000000 which will have to be inverted 0x0000000000678c69 and converted to decimal 6786153. Then apply the formula (6786153 * 8 * 512) or (6786153 * 4096 ) = 27796082688 (offset of the MFT) + 3352 (UUID offset) = 27796086040. so in the partition if we move to byte 27796086040 we will find the UUID of the partition on 16 bytes which will have to be converted into Hexadecimal and inverted for the first 8.  There is not much interest in modifying the UUID of an NTFS partition, Microsoft apparently does not use it, Mac OS X displays the UUIDs of the partitions. There is not much comment on the UUID of NTFS partitions. I've created an AppleScriptsup[2]/sup to read the NTFS or HFS UUIDs. The only UUIDs that I modify are those of the HFS, to start with the choice of the UUID.  sup[1]/sup: +3352 this is for a physical NTFS partition, for a partition of a VHD it's +3320)  sup[2]/sup: AppleScript to read UUID from an NTFS partition. All sudo commands are to be completed for your name and password, otherwise try removing the sudo. I do not advise you to modify the UUID, there is no information on their use. I left the inversion of the bytes in a very rudimentary way.**  precodeset hdd to {} set dmg to do shell script "sudo ls /dev/disk**s** " &amp; " | sed -e 's#[[:space:]]*$##;s#\\/dev\\/##;/^$/d'" user name "Your_Name" password "Your_Password" with administrator privileges set doun to "" set dor to "" set uuidd to "" set uuidd to {}  set hfsountfs to "" set theVol1 to "" set theVol to "" set vhd to "" set leplus to 0 set levhd to "" set hd to {} set _Result to the paragraphs of dmg set n to 0 set n to count _Result set j to 1 do shell script "echo " &amp;

The difference comes from the origin of the formatting. If you format a hdd or vhd from Microsoft Windows, the offset will be, for the UUID in the MFT, 3352 bytes from the beginning of the MFT. If you format a Volume or vhd from Mac OS X, with Diskutil the offset of the UUID will be at 3320 bytes from the beginning of the MFT. All this for a volume (or vhd) NTFS of course.  <comment279875> This appears to be a duplicate of this post:  http://superuser.com/questions/344706/how-does-one-change-the-uuid-of-a-volume-on-mac-os-x-to-a-specified-value <comment279893> @Allan This is no duplicate! The linked question/answers only apply to hfs/hfs+ volumes. In the question here the volume has a ntfs file system. <comment280173> Thank you for your response ! I already done all of that, except the reboot : is it important to reboot te computer, as I disconnected/connected the external HDD after changing the NTFS serial ID ? <comment280174> @pierreonthenet Did it work for you? <comment280175> Sorry, I wanted to add a new line and the comment was send before I finished it... So, no, it doesn't worked for now. I will try after a reboot of my mac when I will get back home. <comment280235> OK, that's strange ! I just made it as you told here (and this is what I made before), but the "Disk / Partition UUID" isn't changing ! I can tell that it's changed, as a "sudo dd if=/dev/disk1s4 of=~/Desktop/superblock2 bs=512 count=1" give me what I have in the modified "superblock". I though that, because the Partition UUID is not the same on my disk0s2 and disk1s4, the change was made, but it seems not. Are you absolutely sure that what you give here is working for you ? <comment280236> I'm using NTFS-3G to have RW access on my NTFS partitions. <comment350267> Say, you were not too tired to make any changes. Removing Hello is very important for a "faignasse" like you who never take anything.
