Prevent iOS Users from updating iOS Version Using Apple Configurator <body> I have a scenario, where my employees are give iPads and iPhones to help with their daily tasks. There are numerous custom business applications installed on this device.  The problem occurs when these users apply updates to the iOS devices, which leaves created compatibility issues for my custom business applications.  My question is,   Is it possible via the iPhone Configuration Utility or the Apple Configurator, to put these devices in "Supervised Mode", which prevents users from installing these updates, be it OTA or via iTunes ?  <answer84063> No, it is not possible to do this.
