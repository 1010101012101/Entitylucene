ipod nano 6th gen radio disabled when docked <body> I have a problem where the FM radio on my 6th gen nano is disabled when the unit is docked (in a Philips Fidelio DS8550 docking speaker). I use an extender on the connector which allows the headphones (ie. the FM antenna) to remain plugged in (so it's not a case of no antenna..) When listening to the radio, as soon as the nano is docked- the radio turns off and the icon disappears from the menu!! I have also determined that when this happens - the headphones output is disabled. This does not happen when using other docks so I suspect that it's something unique to the way the 30 pin connector is configured in the Philips unit. Does anyone know what may be going on or which pins in the connector may be causing this?
