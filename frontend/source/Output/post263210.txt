I have a FAT32 external drive that shows up on OS X Server, but not El Capitan. Any ideas why? <body> I have an external drive that I formatted to FAT32. I copied some data on it from Mac OS X Server and then tried connecting the drive to a Mac OS X El Capitan computer. But when I did, the drive wouldn't show up on the El Capitan computer.  Any ideas why? I am very unfamiliar with Macs.
