mac OS microphone only works when using Siri, works fine on bootcamp <body> As the title says the mic only works in Mac OS when using Siri in any other application it is just muted, img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Rikc.png" alt="enter image description here"the input level in system setting is always 0 as shown in the picture unless I'm using Siri. The mic works just fine on Windows 10 through bootcamp which leads me to believe it is not a hardware problem.  I'm on mac OS Sierra 10.12.3, I tried resetting SMC didn't make a difference.  <answer287466> I cleaned out the tiny little microphone holes by a pin and it worked, per this message on ASC.  <comment346123> I guess you could start troubleshooting the problem by creating a fresh user account to establish whether it is a user or system level problem if you haven't already done this. <comment346312> I tried with a fresh user account still the same problem <comment346547> Can you name any of the other apps you tested the mic with? <comment347314> @AndrewMagdy I'd start by thinking about whether I have installed applications that relate to audio. Have you installed any audio plugins or other applications that specifically rely on CoreAudio or have you ever needed to change your mic input for some reason? To add to this, you may want to check the settings in /Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup.
