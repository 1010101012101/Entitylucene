Per user proxy - OS X 10.10 <body> On 10.9 and previous we used MCX to manage proxy settings on a per user basis. (User level MCX).  This no longer works on 10.10 as MCX has been depreciated for some time now and I am surprised how much it still works in 10.10. So I have looked down the configuration profiles route but I can't see an option for it there either.  Any ideas?  OS X Yosemite (10.10.1)  <answer158207> I have found a solution (possibly temporarily), as part of our loginhook shell script I have entered the following:  precodeUserName="$1" UserGroup="$(sudo -u $UserName id)" if [[ $UserGroup == *teachers* ]] ; then networksetup -setwebproxy Ethernet &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;port&gt; off ; else networksetup -setwebproxy Ethernet &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;port&gt; off ; fi if [[ $UserGroup == *teachers* ]] ; then networksetup -setsecurewebproxy Ethernet &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;port&gt; off ; else networksetup -setsecurewebproxy Ethernet &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;port&gt; off ; fi /code/pre  Essentially it sets the proxy to a specific hostname and port with no authentication if they are part of a particular group. If they are not then they go to a standard proxy port.
