Text not working on iPhone 6 <body> My iPhone 5 has suddenly stopped sending or receiving text msgs. It has worked fine for two years. I've tried switching it off and on, checking all the settings, yesterday I did an update of everything, and still no luck - any ideas? The messaging service works fine.  Thanks for any advice.  <comment316803> Is it all messages, only SMS messages, or only iMessages? <comment316830> Please include the version of iOS that you are using as that is (usually) far more important in a software issue than the version of hardware. Also, the generation of iPhone you are using does not match between the title and your question. <comment317087> Thanks for replying - however now sorted by my grandson!!!!
