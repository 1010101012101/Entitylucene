I emthink/em that your problem is in the line   precodeset fullKindlePath to POSIX path of (kindleLocation as alias) &amp; "documents" /code/pre  I would try changing this to   precodeset fullKindlePath to (the POSIX path of (kindleLocation as alias)) &amp; "documents" /code/pre  then if that doesn't work try code&amp; ("documents" as POSIX PATH)/code  By the way, are you sure that codefullKindlePath/code has a '/' at the end?
