Password dialog very different in app store on iPad-3 iOS 8.0.2? <body> Whenever I'm asked for a password in the app store of my iPad-3 iOS 8.0.2 (e.g., when installing an app), I don't see the password request dialog like before. See the screen shot below. I'm guessing it's a bug, but maybe it's a security feature?  Google didn't find me (easily) any reports of this bug.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TxBkO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment178258> mine only asks for the password once, after boot. After that it just does it. If it's a bug, it would appear to be one of portrait/landscape not knowing which way round it should be.
