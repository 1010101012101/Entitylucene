How to allow a group to access a folder? <body> I want to allow the _www group to write to a folder.  I clicked on the folder to go to the "Get Info".  At the bottom there is a "Sharing &amp; Permissions" section with a "+" to add users. However it does not show any of the system groups such as _www.  Is there a way to enable showing hidden users and group in the GUI? Or do I have to do it via command-line instead? It seems the GUI allows to set permissions for several users and group, which I like, while the command I believe only allow 1 owner and 1 group?   <answer10803> Apple hides anything it considers a "system" user or group from the GUI.  There's probably some way to disable that, but I generally use the command line for system-related stuff.  The command line version comes in two flavors:  there is a basic permissions structure with a single owner, a singe group, and everyone else, then there are POSIX ACLs.   Interestingly, Apple took the route of modifying codechmod/code to support ACLs instead of shipping the standard codegetfacl/code and codesetfacl/code tools.  precode$ sudo chmod +a 'group:_www allow add_file,add_subdirectory,list,search,delete_child' /webroot /code/pre  You may also want the codefile_inherit/code and codedirectory_inherit/code permissions to apply the ACL to created files/directories.  See codechmod(1)/code for more details.  The code-a/code option to codechmod/code removes ACL entries.  <comment11291> +1 because you made me sit down and figure out *why* Apple left out the standard commands and what to do about it. <comment58483> +1 just a small clarification, do you know if/why `sudo chmod -R +a 'permissions' /webroot` will give permissions to all subfolders, but not to `webroot` folder itself? because that's what happened when i tried it.
