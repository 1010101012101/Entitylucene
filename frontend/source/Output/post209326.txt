Can't restore nor update iPhone 4S <body> Whenever I try to turn on my iPhone 4S, it comes out with the Apple logo for a few seconds and then turn off.  Turning it on while holding the + button makes the iTunes screen appear. (The provided link is just an example - strongnot/strong my phone)  When I try to Restore and Update it, it extracts the software, starts to update and then suddenly and slowly fade away the Apple icon and turn off. Then it comes back to the iTunes screen again and the computer shows an unknown error 4013.  Yes, I did try another computer. Another USB cable. It simply won't work.  How can I overcome this?  <answer294156> Error 4013 is a disconnect or repair / service / timing issue.   ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201444/li /ul  The steps there are pretty short to do for the things you can control so it might be as simple as an update to iTunes or a force restart of the phone.   <comment252497> Could this be a hardware or software related issue? Is there any history of your phone's battery being weak? Or a rough drop perhaps? Did strange behaviour with connecting to OS X happen in the past? <comment252498> sorry to tell you this... but here is what Apple says about the matter: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201444 <comment252500> It started right after turning off due low battery. Today, after plugging in the iPhone on my Macbook Pro it completely killed the Macbook Pro too. I feel like dying on the inside. <comment252501> @bret7600 I did include this link on the question <comment252504> sorry, I didn't take a close enough look at the question @Holmes
