Editing wifi connections <body> Hello I'm using Mavericks sys pref  network  advanced and below the list of preferred networks there is the + and - signs but there is no pencil icon to click in order to change the settings. Of course I can delete it and then add it but would like to know how to enable settings changes. Is there some way to edit the settings? Currently, I just need to change the password but I want to know how I could change the authentication in the future (say if the network switches to using WEP2 or WPA). What happened with the pencil icon? Anyway to get it back?  <comment247221> What kind of settings are you trying to change? <comment247240> The password, the network is not prompting me for the password, which was changed recently. That said, I'm also interested in finding a away to change the authentication preferences for any wifi network in the future. In the past I remember seeing some pencil icon I could click to change it. <comment247241> If you remove the network from the list, it should prompt you for the password again the next time you connect. That being said, you can view/change the saved password by finding your network in the Keychain Access application.
