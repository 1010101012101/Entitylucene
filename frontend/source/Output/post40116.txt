Mac OS X Lion Terminal <body> I have a question about my terminal. When I started out working with Rails on my Mac terminal, I would have lines that looked like this as the route for my $:  precodeNicholass-MacBook-Pro:sample_app nbkincaid$ rails console /code/pre  But now, I get lines that look like this:  precodepal-nat184-103-166:desktop nbkincaid$ /code/pre  I'm pretty sure that I didn't change anything, so why does it give me the codepal-nat....$/code instead of the codeNicholas...$/code?  <answer40117> The string "pal-nat184-103-166" is your computer's hostname, which can be changed dynamically by routers or other network devices through DHCP.  If you want to set it to a static string, you can do so by adding the following line to /etc/hostconfig  precodeHOSTNAME=Nicholass-MacBook-Pro /code/pre  <answer40118> You probably messed up your code~/.bash_profile/code file.  Export the S1 shell variable.  For example, I have this one:  precodeexport PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ ' /code/pre  Remember to re-open the console after changing codebash_profile/code file.  https://makandracards.com/makandra/1090-customize-your-bash-prompt  <comment45363> I'd say you've changed something or that your bash shell is set up to display the host name of your computer and you're on a network assigning you a name. <comment45364> You should also check the Sharing preference pane to make sure you have your computer name set to what you want your machine to show up as on the network. <comment45365> Add this to "questions I've always wondered about but never sought through to investigate why" <comment45366> Also, confirmed that you can just change the setting in Sharing pref pane. <comment45407> @PeterLiljenberg Instead of saying that in a comment, you should say that in an answer. <comment45415> Thank you, Peter. It looks like when I log on to my school's wireless network, thats when I notice it, but when I'm on my wireless network at home, it reverts to my name. <comment45416> Thank you, nduplessis. It looks like this is correct. <comment45417> Tim, what do you mean by this? <comment45438> @jason well I guess :).  glad to help <comment45439> @nbkincaid Tim meant he's seen this problem and always wondered about it, but just fixed it and otherwise never cared to ask anyone about it.
