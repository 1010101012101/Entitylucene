Is enabling rw in /etc/fstab for an NTFS volume risky? <body> I've followed this tutorial:  http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-write-to-ntfs-drives-in-os-x-mavericks--cms-21434  I'm not familiar with Mac OS X's NTFS support, having used only ntfs-3g in Linux.  Does making the volume writable with OS X's native driver via fstab pose any risk to my data or volume?
