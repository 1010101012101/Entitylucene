How do I get music tracks to play in the right order on my iphone? <body> I cannot find anywhere in settings or the music app to set the play order. Ios just plays the track list randomly. The shuffle option doesn't seem to do anything in as much as it's not on or off.  Please don't mark this as a duplicate without answering the question as I cannot find a satisfactory answer here on any previous questions. In fact one of the questions I was directed to was from 2012 which is obviously not relevant any more.  I am on iOs 10.3.2 Thank you.  <comment367455> Your question includes directions for answers regarding what to or not to include.  I would ask you to [edit] your question to include references to the questions/answers that you didn't find 'satisfactory' (so that we don't suggest solutions you've already tried) as well as other solutions you've already attempted but found that it didn't solve your problem.  Doing this will help you obtain quality answers and not repeats of other answers.
