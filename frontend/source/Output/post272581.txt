Bluetooth audio playback from phone to Sierra / Mac Pro <body> I have a Samsung S7. It's got gigs of audio on it, all legal and aboveboard. In my vehicle, it connects to the stereo, and I get all my favorites to shuffle or whatever. Works superbly.  I thought it would be nothing to connect to my Mac Pro via bluetooth (it was, in fact easy -- phone says it's properly paired), but nothing shows up in the audio input devices, or anywhere else I have snooped around.  Anyone know how to get this very basic capability going? Apple's support docs for Sierra are extremely vague about all this. Other than "look in input devices", not a clue.  <comment342570> Can you play music via BT from other devices to the Mac?  That will help you determine where the problem lies. <comment342573> As far as I know, I don't have any other bluetooth devices.
