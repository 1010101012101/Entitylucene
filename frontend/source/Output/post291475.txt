Is maximum RAM 8Gb or 16GB in 2010 MacBook Pro? <body> According to Apple my friend's MacBook Pro supports up to 8Gb RAM. But I've heard people say 16Gb is possible. Is it possible later versions of OSX/macOS increased the supported limit?  It's not a poorly specced machine and he already upgraded the hard drive to SSD, but it's dog-slow. I wondered if the 4Gb of RAM is the limiting factor however upgrading 4-8 doesn't sound a huge benefit to me, however 16Gb would be a big difference.  It's running Sierra.
