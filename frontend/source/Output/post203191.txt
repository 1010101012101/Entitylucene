Move the beginning of HFS+ partition <body> What I'm trying to do is move the beginning of the partition on an external HD drive.  I have an external HD drive with two HFS+ partitions on it. I want to grow the first one at expense of the second one. I resized the second one using Disk Utility to a new size, but now I need to move it to the end of the disk so that I can grow the first one, but Disk Utility seems to permit moving only the end of the partition  I think GParted can do what I want, but I really prefer to do it with built-in tools.  <comment246191> You have not posted enough information to answer the question. One way would be to create a compressed image (dmg) of the second partition. Next you would remove the second partition and then expand the first partition. Then recreate the second partition and restore the image to it. This would require space somewhere to store the temporary dmg file. I do not know if you have enough space to store this dmg.
