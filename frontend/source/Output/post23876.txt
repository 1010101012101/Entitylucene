Using three-finger drag and three-finger back on browser <body> For OS X Lion 10.7, is there a way that I can use three-finger drag and still be able to use gestures to swipe "back" in Firefox or Chrome?  I've found out how to do one or the other, but not both.  <answer23889> You cannot use both. Maybe a third-party app will come along to support it or it may in the future, but not now.  <answer23891> You might want to try going into system prefs - mouse (or trackpad) - more gestures, and use this arrow (picture below) to change the default options for gestures.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tESeu.png" alt="arrow to use"
