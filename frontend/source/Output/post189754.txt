Renamed Home Folder, now Dropbox Mac App won't launch <body> I renamed my home folder using these directions from Apple - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548  Worked great. However, now when I try to launch the Dropbox app it asks for permission to modify a folder, which no longer exists.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kXwS1.png" alt="permission problem"  codejoshua1/code no longer exists, it is now just codejoshua/code.   I give permission anyway, and then get this error.   codeCouldn't start Dropbox This is usually because of a permissions error. Storing your home folder on a network share can also cause an error. For more information, click the help button below. Please contact Dropbox support with the following info for help:/code - long text part copied below.   I obviously need to move my Dropbox folder. But according to this Dropbox support article, I need to launch the app and set that in the preferences - https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/89.   Here is what Dropbox gave me to give to their support.  codeH bn.BUILD_KEY: Dropbox bn.VERSION: 3.6.4 bn.DROPBOXEXT_VERSION: failed bn.is_frozen: True pid: 1556 ppid: 1 uid: 502 user_info: pwd.struct_passwd(pw_name='joshua', pw_passwd='********', pw_uid=502, pw_gid=20, pw_gecos='Joshua Dance', pw_dir='/Users/joshua', pw_shell='/bin/bash') effective_user_info: pwd.struct_passwd(pw_name='joshua', pw_passwd='********', pw_uid=502, pw_gid=20, pw_gecos='Joshua Dance', pw_dir='/Users/joshua', pw_shell='/bin/bash') euid: 502 gid: 20 egid: 20 group_info: grp.struct_group(gr_name='staff', gr_passwd='*', gr_gid=20, gr_mem=['root']) effective_group_info: grp.struct_group(gr_name='staff', gr_passwd='*', gr_gid=20, gr_mem=['root']) DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH: None cwd: u'/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources'      real_path=u'/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources'             mode=040755 uid=502 gid=20      parent mode=040755 uid=502 gid=20 HOME: u'/Users/joshua' appdata: u'/Users/joshua1/.dropbox/instance1'          real_path=u'/Users/joshua1/.dropbox/instance1'                 not found          parent not found dropbox_path: u'/Users/joshua1/Dropbox'               real_path=u'/Users/joshua1/Dropbox'                         not found               parent    not found sys_executable: '/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/python'                 real_path='/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/python'                         mode=0100755    uid=502 gid=20                 parent  mode=040755 uid=502 gid=20 trace.__file__: '/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/site-packages.zip/dropbox/client/ui/common/boot_error.pyo'                 real_path='/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/site-packages.zip/dropbox/client/ui/common/boot_error.pyo'                         not found                 parent  not found tempdir: u'/var/folders/r9/dql9_58x0qq8x54hqtl1sw3m0000gp/T'          real_path=u'/private/var/folders/r9/dql9_58x0qq8x54hqtl1sw3m0000gp/T'                 mode=040700 uid=502 gid=20          parent mode=040755 uid=502 gid=20 Traceback (most recent call last):   File "dropbox/client/main.pyo", line 3332, in main_startup   File "dropbox/client/main.pyo", line 1594, in run   File "dropbox/client/main.pyo", line 796, in startup_low   File "dropbox/client/main.pyo", line 567, in safe_makedirs   File "os.pyo", line 150, in makedirs   File "os.pyo", line 150, in makedirs   File "os.pyo", line 157, in makedirs OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Users/joshua1' /code  <answer190039> Dropbox support got back to me, and had a fix. Not simple so open up your terminal.   Please save and quit all programs accessing files in the Dropbox folder, and then follow these instructions:  Note: Please be sure to take note or take a screenshot of any Selective Sync settings you may have applied prior to re-installing in case you need to re-apply these settings upon re-install.  ol liStop Dropbox (If needed):  ul liClick the Dropbox icon in the menu bar at the top of your screen/li liClick on the gear icon in the Notifications panel and select 'Quit Dropbox'/li /ul/li liDownload the newest version:/li /ol  www.dropbox.com/install  ol start="3" liOpen your Terminal app (Located at /Applications/Utilities/Terminal)/li liCopy and paste the following lines into the Terminal, ONE AT A TIME, and press ENTER after each one. PLEASE make sure you copy and paste these commands (don't type them by hand), as getting them wrong could cause some harm.
