How can I paste the selected text on macOS? <body> I have selected some text and I want to use kbdshift/kbd+kbdinsert/kbd like I do to paste the currently selected text on Linux. How can I do that on a MacBook?  <answer273678> I found the answer on Stack Overflow: it's kbdShift/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdV/kbd to paste selected text, without copying the text first. This might be all you need (I'm delighted it's even possible - I assumed it wasn't); however, you could if you wished remap this key combination to something more like kbdShift/kbdkbdInsert/kbd using one of the apps suggested in the answers to Re-map keys on keyboard.  <comment344044> Did you mean "copied", or "selected"? On Linux I'd use Shift-Insert to paste text I'd selected, but Ctrl-V to paste text I'd copied. I don't know if the former is possible on macOS - I'm hoping someone will prove me wrong! <comment344046> @JohnN, selected, sorry <comment344048> I'm struggling to see how that works. If I have some text selected & want to paste it somewhere, I first have to move the cursor to where I want to paste, which unselects... :/ <comment344051> @Tetsujin - it's most useful in a terminal: the cursor position won't change when you select text. Try selecting a command a few lines back, then press Shift-Command-V, or doing the same in vi/emacs/nano. <comment344052> Cool, it is right on the mac bash command line and vim. <comment344053> ah, gotcha. I guess it's unlikely to work anywhere that isn't true, couldn't work in any regular text app. <comment344054> @Tetsujin, yeah, that's true, this shortcut is widely used among programmers! And the Macbook is really a arsenal!
