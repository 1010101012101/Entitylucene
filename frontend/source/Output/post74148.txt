iTunes 11 does not record Play Counts anymore? <body> I was playing an album the other day and noticed that none of the songs being played are incrementing their play count. I am running iTunes 11.0 and would like play counts to work like before.   What is happening and can I fix this?  <answer74152> According to some articles I've read on the net, it's a design flaw by Apple - disabling crossfade will make the playcount start to work again.  <answer74278> I think it's a universal glitch that's occurring with the new iTunes update they just had, seeing that this problem only showed up after the update.   <comment86135> I haven't experienced this with iTunes 11 on 10.7. I just tested by playing a song and the play count incremented as expected. That said, it could easily be an issue specific to 10.8 or some other quirk â€” iTunes 11 seems to be full of small issues that don't show up for everyone. <comment86158> I have the same problem, it doesn't work with crossfade on. <comment86669> Seems like Apple is facing some quality control issues <comment87074> Can anyone tell if this is fixed in iTunes 11.0.1? An edit here once that is confirmed would be ideal. <comment87105> @bmike not able to edit my question atm (out of town, terrible internet access) but if someone else verifies that upgrading the software works feel free to edit that in.
