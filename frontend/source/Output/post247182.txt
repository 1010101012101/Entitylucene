Clear all messages from current Terminal session <body> In a Terminal window, if I issues a "clear" command it clears the screen.  But if I scroll up, the messages are still there.  Is there a way to clear call completely?  Currently, I have to close and reopen the Terminal again to achieve this.  <answer247184> To completely clear the screen in Terminal, so there is no scroll back, you can either use the menu and click strongEdit/strong  strongClear to start/strong or use the keyboard and press: kbdcommand/kbd-kbdK/kbd  <comment305059> Clear to start does not work.  But command-k does.
