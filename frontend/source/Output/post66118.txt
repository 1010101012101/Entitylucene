How to remove leading or trailing spaces from copy/paste operations? <body> I usually have to copy/paste test from web pages (or other places) and paste it into HTML forms (usually Chrome).  The problem is that ofter I do end-up with a text that has additional leading or trailing spaces.  Is there a way to prevent this, by default? Like an OS X application or Chrome extension that can trick how paste works?  <answer66129> ThereÂ´s an app for that. ClipMenu besides keeping a clipboard history it is possible to assign scripts to the entries. (1) You copy as usual (2) click on ClipMenu's status bar icon, select your latest entry, and use a user-selectable key-click command to perform LTrim or RTrim on the entry. ClipMenu is freeware.  <comment77785> Thanks, this almost solves the problem, but still I cannot make it work when I press `Cmd+V` or doing a right-mouse-click and selecte Paste.
