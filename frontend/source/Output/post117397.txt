Find My Friends shows my old phone <body> I traded in my 4S recently to upgrade to a 5S, and restored the 5S from the last 4S backup, so they both share the same phone name ("Adam's iPhone"). However, when I use the "Find My Friends" app, it displays "Share my location from:" and shows "Adam's iPhone" twice.  I visited this Apple Support page, which suggested to log into iCloud and disable the second phone from there, but only one phone is listed on that page (along with my iPad and iMac). Is there another link that explains how to remove the old phone from "Find My Friends"?  <answer117407> In addition to what's on that Apple page, here's what's going on: Your two devices have the same name, so you need to change the name of the iPhone 5S: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3965  Once you see the both devices showing on iCloud with different names, then you should be able to 'eliminate' the other device per the instructions on that page on removing Apple devices from 'Find My...'.  Tech aside: Different UDIDs, same 'device name' causes headaches...  <answer138929> had same issue tried all hove. went into settings and location services and i noticed i had find my friend app unchecked needs to be checked to locate  <answer148242> I found the way to do it on iOS 8: Settings  Privacy  Location Services  Share My Location  From  Then is will show the list of current and old phones.  It has instructions:  "If you're no longer using a device, swipe left on the device name, then tap Delete."  It worked for me!  <answer157676> I've had the same issue and I can say that iCloud does show duplicate names for different devices with the same name.  Furthermore, removing the old device from iCloud still leaves it displayed in the Find Friends app.  However, removing it from Privacy  Location Services  My Devices takes care of it.  <comment137197> Open up the Find iPhone app (not Find Friends). Are both of the phones listed there? <comment137202> That is all correct, except that only one iPhone shows up in the OP's Find My iPhone account. <comment137203> He has to change the names because iCloud may only 'list' *one* 'named' device... even tho' it *should* be smart enough to list 2 devices with 2 different UDIDs. Also, iCloud may have to be kicked (on-off) cycles a number of times. 2 problems here: Find My iPhone's handling of 'names'... and crappy iCloud sync. <comment137256> @ChrisMukherjee - no, just the 5S. <comment137257> I renamed the phone, and I will try this tonight. Thanks! <comment137333> @leoofborg Ahhh I see.
