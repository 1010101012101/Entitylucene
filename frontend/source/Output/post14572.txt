What's fastest: iPhone 4 tethering with bluetooth, usb or the new hotspot feature? <body> I'm going to use the internet on a MacBook 5,2 and I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.3.1 and it's jailbroken (and using TetherMe), if it makes any differences.  <answer14573> Bluetooth with iPhone's specifications has a max. throughput of 3 MBit/s. So this could be a bottleneck if you get higher 3G speeds.  <answer14576> Fastest to slowest:  ol liUSB/li liWiFi hotspot/li liBluetooth/li /ol  Keep in mind the power draw of the options. From most battery efficient to least:  ol liUSB (It helps that it's also charging at the same time.)/li liBluetooth/li liWiFi/li /ol
