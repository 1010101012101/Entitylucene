outlook.com (Exchange ActiveSync) on OS X Mountain Lion <body> Outlook.com offers email/contacts/calendar similar to Google. With my iPhone and iPad (iOS 6.1.3) I can connect to outlook.com by setting up an Exchange account. It uses the Exchange ActiveSync protocol. On OS X Mountain Lion I can choose an Exchange server in the Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendar settings tab, but it does not connect when I put in my outlook.com login.  Is there a way to connect to outlook.com via Exchange ActiveSync to access email, contacts and calendar?  <answer98140> Unlike iOS, the Mail app in OS X does not currently support Exchange ActiveSync.   Exchange ActiveSync is different from the standard Exchange format. A mail client that supports Exchange may not support EAS.  <comment115182> True, it's not working ... :) <comment165884> For Apple to support Exchange ActiveSync on iOS but not on Mac OS is a giant WTF.
