Magic Mouse 2 for Mac <body> Magic Mouse 2 appears as it is connected but it will not scroll; when you click on something it will not put on the screen what you clicked on. I have to triple click on the item to get rid of it on the screen.  I would like to know if there is a problem with the mouse.  <answer261423> Minimum OS requirement is El Capitan, 10.11  Ref: Apple KB - Magic Mouse 2 - Technical Specifications     System Requirements        ul   liBluetooth-enabled Mac computer with OS X v10.11 or later/li   /ul
