Can Pages '09 create a list inside a list? <body> Is there a way to create a "sublist" inside a list item from an outer list in Pages '09?  More specifically, I want to do this: br Example made with HTML (should look like this):  precode&lt;ol start="1"&gt;   &lt;li&gt;First category&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Second category:     &lt;br&gt;     Here is a text. And a list:     &lt;ul&gt;       &lt;li&gt;Point&lt;/li&gt;       &lt;li&gt;Another point&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;     Proceed with text. Perfect.   &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Third category&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; /code/pre  br  Here's a screenshot of Pages where I'm trying to do this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aKBQ6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer92611> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lbije.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Yes, changing the color is emcheating/em and it's not an elegant solution...  In order to change the icon color, you need to open the inspectorbr kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdI/kbd and go to emT &#x2192; List &#x2192; Bullets &amp; Numbering/em  <comment108662> BTW: I made the new line after 'Two' with [ctrl]+[Enter]. <comment108663> You're right. It's possible to make lists in Pages as I made them with HTML before. I updated my question to explain exactly what I wanted to do. <comment108668> Excellent edit to clarify the case here. I've a sneaking suspicion you'll need to modify styles to get an indented body style that happens to be the same amount of indent as the `- Two:` item with no space before or after, but I'll have a look later to see if this is possible without resorting to custom styles that would be fragile if you changed the level of indent.
