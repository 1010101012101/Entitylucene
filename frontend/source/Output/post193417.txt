iPhone does not upload photos to iCloud via Wi-Fi <body> Since I upgraded to 200 GB iCloud storage and started to use the new Photo app I have now been able to backup any from my iPhone via iCloud to my Mac.  My iPhone also stopped sharing my iPhone photos to Photo Stream.  Essentially I have not had a backup of any iPhone photos the last 18 days since I upgraded to 200 GB iCloud.  Over 800 pictures will not sync to my iMac via iCloud over Wi-Fi and are not backed up.  On the Iphone under ICloud - I have choosen: Optimize Iphone Memory.  I have the option to share Photos but I thought that I bought a complete easy backup service by upgrading.  On my iPhone I have tried to disable and enable Photo for iCloud and also log out and in from iCloud, but did not sync photos.  <comment230539> Try putting your iPhone to charge, and leave it alone. I think it only syncs when charging, connected to the WiFi, and not in use. <comment230543> Thanks LaX - Every night my Iphone charges with WiFi - before the upgrade - my iPhone used to backup via upload to Photo Stream via Wifi - every night <comment230545> Check settings  iCloud on the phone & also the Auto backup panel in iTunes
