Map Control+Delete to Forward Delete <body> I use a wireless Apple keyboard at home and a wired (full sized) one at work. Now I constantly get confused when I want to do a forward delete, since I'm used to the kbdfn/kbd+kbddelete/kbd combination.  Is it possible to somehow map kbdcontrol/kbd+kbddelete/kbd to do the same thing? (kbdcontrol/kbd is in the same location as kbdfn/kbd on the full size keyboard)  <answer159416> You can do this with Karabiner with a private.xml such as this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Forward Delete with ⌃⌫&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.ctrlbackspace&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__       KeyCode::DELETE, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE,       KeyCode::FORWARD_DELETE     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment187334> [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) might be able to do that, not tested. <comment187436> I didn't even need a custom XML, there is already a setting in Karabiner for that in the `Change Delete Key` section under `Control+Delete to Forward Delete`
