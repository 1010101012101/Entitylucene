Reconnecting to a Network Volume on Startup: Password Required <body> I have some network volumes in my strongLogin Items/strong so that I can reconnect at startup. Being on a network, they naturally require a password.  Every time I start up, I enter the passwords, select the check box to add to the key chain, and proceed. However, this never seems to work, since on next start up, they want the password again.  Is there any way to reconnect to the network volumes without re-entering the password?  I have one volume mounted via SMB, and the other via NFS. I am running MacOS 10.12.4  <comment350477> What happens if you remove a volume from Login Items and try and mount it manually, like this: `/usr/bin/osascript -e "try" -e "mount volume \"smb://user@host/share\"" -e "end try"`? This is how I automate mounting network volumes to avoid entering a password, but I'd suspect it's equivalent to adding a volume to Login Items so it may not work - but at least it'd help narrow down where the problem is.
