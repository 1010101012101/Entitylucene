Why doesn't Automator service appear in iTunes? <body> I'm trying to write an Automator service for iTunes so that I can immediately open a file from iTunes in VLC, so I don't have to do (show in finder, launch with other application, vlc).  I go to Automator, create a Service, in the top right dropdowns, I choose: "Service receives selected codeaudio files/code in codeany application/code", and the script itself is just "Open Finder Items" with VLC.   However, the service doesn't appear. Not in finder, not in iTunes.. I'm very confused. Any thoughts what's going on? I tried restarting computer, restarting iTunes, all to no avail.  Thanks!  <answer26096> To get it to work in iTunes, you can try setting it up like this:  Service receives selected: codetext/code in: codeiTunes/code  Actions:  "Get Selected iTunes Tracks" - Get selected: codetracks/code  "Open Finder items" - Open with: codeVLC/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rs5Xd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment29743> Can't you set VLC to be the default app for these files so you just need to double click <comment29821> Thank you, that works perfectly. For future reference, seem to have run into this really weird issue, where if I save an existing Service and change the 'receives selected' field, it won't appear. I had to make a new Service to get it to appear!
