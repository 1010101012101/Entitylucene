MacBook Optimal Disk Formatting <body> What's the optimal formatting for a MacBook disk?  My disk seems to be formatted as a LVG (Logical Volume Group) and it seems emsuper/em slow...  <answer178738> Optimal is what it's formatted as when you get the machine.br GUID/HFS+   LVG/Core Storage is necessary if you ever enabled FileVault. [Some updates to Yosemite also seem to have triggered that conversion too]  Try Blackmagic Disk Speed Test to see what speeds it's actually achieving.  <comment211766> Blackmagic Disk Speed Test is basically showing me 70MB/s read and write, doesn't look good.... <comment211767> that's not terrible for a HD, especially if it's only a 5200 rpm unit. Most of my HDs here are only pulling between 70 & 90MB/s, the fast one at 145, my SSD at 260
