Change the default zoom level for new documents in Excel 2016 for Mac <body> How do I change the default zoom level for new documents in Excel 2016 for Mac? I looked online but found a lot of conflicting information. Also, most tutorials online seem to be for the 2011 version rather than the 2016 version.  The default zoom is 100% but I'd like to change it to 150%.  <answer276020> You can create a new template with your custom zoom level and then use this template when creating a new document.  ol liCreate a new blank document./li liSet the zoom to your desired level./li liChoose File → Save as Template…./li liEnter a name for the template such as "Blank"./li liWhen creating a new document, choose your new template.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CH4aD.png" width="583"/li /ol  <answer276021> There is a lot of confusion around how to do this, not just because it's changed from Excel 2011 to Excel 2016, but also because the process has even changed during Excel 2016's lifecycle.  I've also seen a number of different ways people have used to achieve a totally customised default workbook.   In the interests of providing alternatives, I thought I'd share my preferred method as well:  ol liOn your Mac create a new folder called "xlstart". You can create this folder anywhere, but I prefer doing it within the Documents folder./li liLaunch Excel/li liGo to Preferences  General  At startup/li liFor strongopen all files in/strong set the emxlstart/em folder you created at Step 1 as the path/li liExit preferences /li liOpen a new workbook and customise your Zoom setting to 150%./li liWhile you're at it, you can also customise a whole heap of other attributes if you like /li liSave the workbook strongas an Excel template/strong, making sure you use the name "workbook", strongand/strong make sure it's saved in the emxlstart/em folder you created at Step 1. (strongNote:/strong when saving the file, if Excel has placed the em.xltx/em extension at the end of the file name, then manually remove the em.xltx/em extension before saving)/li liQuit Excel/li liLaunch Excel/li /ol  You should now find the default workbook has all the customisations you made at Steps 6 &amp; 7.
