iCloud backup space <body> Does the amount of iCloud space need to be able to fit the current backup PLUS the new one?  I'm assuming the answer is yes but since backups appear to overwrite each other I'm questioning that.  Problem being that I keep getting a message saying that there's not enough iCloud storage and that my backup failed.  If I have 5Gb of iCloud storage and 1.9Gb free with nothing else other than my current device back up in theory it should be plenty of space   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTfBm.png" alt="backup stats"  I want to know why if my next backup of size is only going to be 532Mb and I have 1.6 gigs free why is the back up unsuccessful   <comment360361> It only backs up the changed files <comment360362> Then I should have plenty of space, without the not enough storage error; <comment360364> are you having problems with enough storage space? If you are, I'd recommend asking that question, instead of this one. <comment360369> This looks like an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info), so can you describe in more details which problem you are trying to solve here (without already making assumptions about the cause)? <comment360372> Updated in main post <comment360646> The only question included in the question text is answered in the answers to the original question. So while it might not be a duplicate any longer, it's not really clear what your question is here. <comment360690> Updated again - also the top voted answer in that post states "The warning you describe comes up when the expected size of the next backup is greater than the available free space." Which clearly isn't the issue here
