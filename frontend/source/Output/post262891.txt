Are Mac OS images (eg. "OS X El Capitan.app") digitally signed? Safe to install from torrent? <body> So, I've upgraded OSX to Sierra, but I need to downgrade (long story), and OSX won't let me because I didn't create a Time Machine backup before upgrading.  So I have downloaded the codeInstall OS X El Capitan.app/code image using BitTorrent.  I assume Apple are wise enough to digitally sign their OS images, such that this is safe. But I would like to know for certain before proceeding.  <answer262895> If you purchased/downloaded any version of Mac OS X from 10.7 to 10.11, you can always re-download it from the App Store on your computer.  After doing that, you can even create a bootable USB with the image.  <answer262914> The original macOS installer apps are not distributed as images (i.e. dmg files). So you won't find a digitally signed emmacOS Installer.dmg/em, dmg signing is possible though: How to add codesigning to dmg file in mac.  However, you can check the codesigning of the macOS/OS X Installer.app and the sha sum of the InstallESD.dmg (which contains the files which will be installed to your disk later):  precodecodesign -dv --verbose=4 /Volumes/InstallMavericks/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app /code/pre  and   precodeshasum /Volumes/InstallMavericks/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg /code/pre  Compare the shasum result with the following list: Apple Installer Checksums. If the checksum is different the dmg is tampered.  The name of the mounted Mavericks.dmg (i.e. InstallMavericks) is just an example - so use the proper path to the macOS/OS X Installer.app.  <comment329339> See  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254720/download-el-capitan-installer-now-that-sierra-is-out <comment329345> This doesn't answer the question! <comment329346> @klanomath Perhaps not the question as asked, but as the ultimate goal of the OP is to install a previous version of Mac OS X, I'm offering a suggestion to help them accomplish that, in case they didn't know about that. <comment329498> Thank you very much! This was exactly what I needed.
