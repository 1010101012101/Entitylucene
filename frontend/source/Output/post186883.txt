Connecting windows computer to Apple display <body> What cables do I need to connect a Thinkpad X230 Lenovo laptop to a  LED cinema apple display? I have attached an image of the apple display port here. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rYU0Y.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment220752> There are ADC, DVI, Mini Displayport and Thunderbolt Apple cinema displays. A picture of the cable coming out of the display or a link to the exact model will help us help you. Also, the connectors on the PC might help narrow down your options. <comment220845> Please have a look at the video ports your laptop and your Apple Cinema display offers and add those to the question. There are many different Lenovo laptop models out there, with various interface options.  If you don't know how to determine the type of port yourself, either specify the specific model name for both the laptop and the display or add pictures of the ports offered by the devices. <comment220908> The Thinkpad X230 Lenovo laptop has DisplayPort connectors. The Apple LED cinema display has Mini DisplayPort. So you need a DisplayPort-to-Mini-DisplayPort adapter, with a gender change for the Mini DisplayPort. Here is an example: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812200691CVF&cm_re=mini_displayport_to_displayport-_-12-200-691CVF-_-Product <comment220913> Actually, looking at a photo, that laptop appears to have a Mini DisplayPort, so no adapter would be required. The photo seems to contradict listed specs.
