Photo Taking Application with Jokes <body> I plan to get an iPhone, one of the tricks I can think of is to use it to play a joke on my friends.  This is how the joke goes. I would ask my friend to pose for me in the name of testing the quality of the camera. As I snap his/her photos, instead of showing his/her real face, I want the snapshot to be replaced with a picture of a pig (say), or anything that would elicit laughter.  Is there such an app available?   <answer2944> Uff, there are a “lot” of photo + fun applications in the App Store. Here’s a few I’ve tried:  ul liFace Substitution/li liSwap Faces: Very funny (has a Lite version)/li liFace It: Allows you to add overlays of things (glasses, mustaches, etc)/li liFace Melter: allows you to deform a face (it makes you laugh a lot to be honest)/li /ul  I have performed a “Face” search in the AppStore for iPhone apps and there are quite a lot, I suggest you take a look at those.   <comment2638> You could save yourself the trouble and just pretend to take a picture, then show your friend an image from the "Photos" app. Har har. (Can you tell I'm not much entertained by such apps?) <comment2639> @torbengb, I afraid that my hands are not fast enough for this
