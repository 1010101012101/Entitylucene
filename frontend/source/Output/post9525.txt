Printopia (AirPrint): turn it on/off via command line? <body> I love Printopia - this allows my iDevices to print to a printer attached to my Mac. The problem is I usually don't leave it on all the time. Whenever I want to print from my phone, I'd turn it on via System Preferences app.  Question: is it possible to do so via command line? This way I can ssh in my Mac and turn it on/off (or even better, write some simple script to automate the process).  <answer40140> There's no real reason that I can think of emnot/em to leave it on all of the time, but you can easily turn it on and off by loading or unloading the launchd plist:  This will turn it on:  codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ecamm.printopia.plist/code  This will turn it off:  codelaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ecamm.printopia.plist/code  Or you could just run the server directly:  code/Library/PreferencePanes/Printopia.prefPane/Contents/MacOS/Printopia Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Printopia Server/code  (that's all one line)
