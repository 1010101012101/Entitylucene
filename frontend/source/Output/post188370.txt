Can I install figlet from the terminal? <body> I really love FIGlet, and use it frequently in my code and emails. It's really easy to install through the terminal in Linux, but I can't figure out how to install it on a Mac (OS X Yosemite 10.10.3). Does anyone know how to install FIGlet straight for Mac so I can run it from the terminal?  <answer188371> You can install it using homebrew. Just type the following:  precodebrew install figlet /code/pre  If you don't have homebrew installed, you can simply do it by typing:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  <comment223028> Worked like a charm - thanks!
