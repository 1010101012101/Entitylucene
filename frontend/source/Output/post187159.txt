Why can't I turn off my right click? <body> I'm running 10.10, and have a wireless mighty mouse. I want to turn off the right click on the mouse. I went to System Settings  Mouse, and set the "Right Click" function to "Primary Button" instead of Secondary. However, this has no effect, and the right click still functions as a right click. Why is this?  <answer187178> For my codeMagic Mouse/code, Setting the codeSecondary click/code option to "click on left side," simply makes it so that the "right click" (contextual) behavior is reversed.  i.e. emleft-clicking/em brings up a menu, and emright-clicking/em is a normal click.  strongUN/strongchecking the checkbox beside codeSecondary Click/code turns off the "right click" behavior altogether.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXHE0.png" alt="Sys Pref"  <answer187204> Logging out and back in solved the issue. Doesn't seem right that you should have to log out to apply changes to the mouse settings, but it worked.
