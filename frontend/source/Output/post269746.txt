Sierra dropped the WiFi: conflicting country codes <body> I recently upgraded to Sierra on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013), going from el cap to the latest Sierra.  All was pretty good, until this morning the computer just decided to drop the connection to the WiFi, which until that point was working without flaws.  I literally went from 0 problem to dropped connection, and now Airport does not connect anymore.  The diagnostics give idiotic suggestions (all of which I already use), and comes up with 'conflicting country codes'.  Please note the router is still working flawlessly with other devices.  How do I fix this?  do I need to remove all the saved info for airport and reset it altogether?  <comment338900> The issue went away inexplicably as it came up.  Now the wifi works.  I did nothing to fix it.  Inexplicable.
