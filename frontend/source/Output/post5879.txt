OS X in VM Ware or Virtual Box <body> Is it possible to run OS X in VM Ware? I want to setup a virtualized OS X for testing instead of going to buy another mac. Can I do that technically and legally?  To be explicit I do own a mac already.  <answer5890> You can do it technically. Legally I think you can do it if a) The VM is on Mac hardware and b) you purchase a unique disk (license) for the OS in the VM.  <comment6105> There is one other condition: the OS in the VM has to be Mac OS X Server. Regular Mac OS X will not install. <comment6115> Awesome thanks for the information. <comment68806> What about Lion or Mountain Lion: there is no CD for these OS
