Allow port arbitrary port (such as 5432) open on El Capitan. <body> I'm running vagrant and successfully port forwarding from there. My issue is that some ports are not running. I know vagrant is working because I can successfully forward port 80, but cannot forward 5432.   Per these direction, I cannot codesudo ipfw list/code as codeipfw/code is not found on this OS (El Capitan thing I suppose?).   precodestuff$ sudo ipfw list sudo: ipfw: command not found /code/pre  I'm running a GUI that is unable to connect to 5432, so I think it's on mac's end.  <answer226554> The ipfw firewall has been replaced by pf in Mac OS X Lion and later. Try looking at the man page for pfctl to start.  An old, but still good cheat sheet for pf  As for debugging network connections on the Mac, I would run codenetstat/code to see what ports had listeners. And possibly codesudo lsof -i/code to see which process had which port open.  <comment275078> Your question is incomplete. Please specify your provider (e.g. VirtualBox). Do you have a firewall running?
