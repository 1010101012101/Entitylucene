Xamarin needs you to connect to a Mac capable of running it.  From Introduction to Xamarin.iOS for Visual Studio     Xamarin for Windows allows iOS applications to be written and tested   within Visual Studio, with a networked Mac providing the build and   deployment service.      There are a number of configuration options available, so you can   decide which works best for your development needs. These are listed   below:      ul   liUse a Mac as your main development Machine and run a Windows Virtual   Machine with Visual Studio installed. We recommend using VM software   such as Parallels or VMWare .   /li   liUse a Mac just as a Build Host. In this   scenario it would be simply connected to the same network as a Windows   machine with the necessary tools installed. /li   /ul      In either case, you should   follow these steps:      ul   liInstall the Xamarin.iOS tools on your Mac host and activate your license  /li   liConfigure your Mac  /li   liInstall Xamarin tools on Windows /li   /ul      To develop   with Xamarin in Visual Studio, you must be using at least Visual   Studio 2012 Professional or higher. Xamarin will not work with Express   Editions of Visual Studio, as they do not support add-ins.   <answer282402> You need the enterprise license  https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/windows/ios-simulator/     Remoted iOS Simulator requires a Visual Studio Enterprise license   <comment327439> i had connect VMware runing os x complete but simulator not working it wasn't exsit in ios setting.
