How to coordinate or see PC and iPhone Outlook mail operations? <body> How do I allow access to or follow revision(s) of send and receive actions made independently on the PC or iPhone Outlook Mail accounts? Presently they each independently retrieve the same email from a master email server but neither is able to “see” the send/receive operations of the other.  <comment338078> Is the account IMAP or POP? POP accounts don't synchronise.
