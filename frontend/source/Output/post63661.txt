iCal: How can I define a custom sorting of reminders? <body> I would like to know how to define custom sorting criteria for reminders.  For instance, I would like to define a sorting criteria that does the following:  ol liSorts reminders whose due date falls within the next 7 days by day./li liAssigns equal sorting priority to events within the same week if those events are beyond 7 days from today./li liAssigns equal sorting priority to events within the same month if those events are beyond 1 month from the current day./li /ol  How can I do this (if it can be done at all)?  An answer that provides a general indication of how to define custom sorting criteria would also be sufficient.
