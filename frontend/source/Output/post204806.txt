iPod 5 to iPhone <body> I have an iPod 5. If I block an iPhone user (not sure if the type matters) will they still be able to see the conversations &amp;&amp; messages we had before I blocked them?   <answer204807> Yes, the old messages will still be there. All blocking them does is ensure that you don't receive any more calls, texts, or FaceTime Audio calls from them.
