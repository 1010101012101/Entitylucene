Whenever I open the Mac Terminal it shows "no such files or directory" <body> Whenever I open my Mac Terminal something goes wrong. I am getting:     -bash: USERNAME: No such file or directory   This issue started to happen suddenly. I don't have any clue why it is happening.  <answer252381> Whenever you open terminal some scripts are automatically called.  Programs (and users) add different commands to those files to set up their environment.  In default OS X configuration you are running a Bash shell which might run the following scripts:  ul licode~/.bash_profile/code (most probable)/li licode~/.bashrc/code/li licode/etc/bashrc/code/li liother can also be included from the above/li /ul  You need to check (display for example with command codecat ~/.bash_profile/code) each of them and search for the string codeUSERNAME/code that is in the error message.  The next step depends solely on the content of the file. You might remove the offending lines or (safer) comment them out (putting code#/code in front of the line).  <comment314000> Have You checked `~/.bash_profile` file? <comment314001> @MateuszSzlosek how to open that
