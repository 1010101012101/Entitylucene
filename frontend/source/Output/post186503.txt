How to upload my iMovie project to iCloud drive? <body> I would like to get my iMovie project on my iPad. My iCloud Drive is turned on on every device. I mean the strongproject/strong, not the result from the theater. Video from theater is there on my device. But what about project? In my iMovie preferences my checkbox codeAutomatically upload.../code is checked...  <answer186508> Find the project file, then copy it and paste it into iCloud Drive in finder.   Hope this helps.   <comment220279> Project file? What extension has a project file? Is not a directory with subdirectories? <comment220460> It is a directory with subdirectories, your mac will allow it to be executed on iOS.
