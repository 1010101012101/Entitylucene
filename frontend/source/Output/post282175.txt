Iphone 4 is neither ringing nor vibrating <body> I have iphone 4 and few days ago it stopped ringing though alarm is working but everything else is just shut. So i was working with the vibration of phone but from the last few days it stops working too. I tried everything from restoring to cleaning but it is not responding at all.  <comment355268> Take it to an Apple Store. <comment355280> Have you checked the mute switch? There was also a bug in early iOS versions that caused the proximity sensor to misbehave and mute the phone. What iOS is installed on this iPhone?
