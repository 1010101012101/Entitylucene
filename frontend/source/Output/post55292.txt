How do I negotiate dialogue boxes using the keyboard only? <body> On Windows based machines, whenever a dialogue box pops up with multiple choice options (ie 'Abort', 'Continue', 'Retry'), you can use the 'Tab' key to cycle through those options without using the mouse.  On OSX, there doesn't appear to be an option to cycle through dialogue boxes using a key rather than the Trackpad.  Is there any keyboard shortcut to do this?  Thanks  <answer55293> It is also the tab key. The difference to Windows is, that the "return" key always pushes the default button (which is the colored one). The currently selected button (which can be changed using the tab key) is marked through a colored border. If you'd like to push this button, you have to press the space bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vudyD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer55294> You can cycle the dialog boxes. Also note that by default kbdesc/kbd will choose strongcancel/strong.  To enable switching via the tab key this feature go to strongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Keyboard &#x2192; Shortcuts &#x2192; Full Keyboard Access... &#x2192; All Controls/strong  Now you can use the tab key to switch the selection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LqNdx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer234719> Enable focusing with tab key at  → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongShortcuts/strong → strongFull Keyboard Access.../strong → strongAll Controls/strong  kbdtab/kbd moves between buttons    kbdspace/kbd presses focused button (with blue outline)  kbdreturn/kbd presses default button (with blue background)    kbd⌘/kbd+kbdfirst letter on button/kbd presses that button (strongworks sometimes/strong)  kbd⌘/kbd+kbd./kbd cancels      kbdesc/kbd cancels      <comment63476> Ah that's it!  Thanks for the help. <comment63477> Just remember that for this to work you must have it enabled in **System Prefereces / Keyboard / Shortcuts** <comment63480> This is the second part of the problem - I didn't have it enabled in the first place! <comment63507> See: [How can I select buttons with just the keyboard?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/7263/1453) <comment63580> Thanks for edits and additional helpful articles everyone <comment286969> See also: http://superuser.com/questions/473143/how-to-tab-between-buttons-on-an-mac-os-x-dialog-box <comment303455> On my Mac, running OS X 10.11, *System Preferences* informs me that this setting can be changed with kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF7/kbd.
