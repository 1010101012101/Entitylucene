How to find the installation destination from postinstall script for OSX installer when PackageKit has moved it <body> (cross post from stackoverflow.com)  When our installer runs, if the user has previously installed or moved the app to some location other than /Applications (or installd finds a previous version somewhere else on the system), we see this message appear in our install log:  precodeAug  3 12:08:50 mbp15-04539.carboniteinc.com installd[3017]: PackageKit: Applications/MyApp.app relocated to /Users/stebro/dev/myapp/build/MyApp-darwin-x64/MyApp.app /code/pre  (in this case, it has found MyApp.app that was built locally on my machine).  When installd invokes our postinstall script, the code$2/code parameter is supposed to be the install location, but we're getting this error:  precodeAug  3 12:08:51 mbp15-04539.carboniteinc.com installd[3017]: ./postinstall: cp: /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/MyAppDefaults.plist: No such file or directory /code/pre  when executing this line from postinstall:  precodeAPPDIR="$2/MyApp.app/Contents" sudo cp "$APPDIR/Resources/MyAppDefaults.plist" "/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mycompany.myapp.plist" /code/pre  The problem is that code$2/code appears to be the original, intended location of the installation instead of where installd decided to move it to.  Deleting the application at code/Users/stebro/dev/myapp/build/MyApp-darwin-x64/MyApp.app/code prior to install solves the problem.  We're using Sparkle as our installer solution; this particular problem occurs on OS X 10.10 in this instance, but also on later versions.  What abstraction should we be using to represent the actually place the application was installed?
