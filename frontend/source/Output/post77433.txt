Setting a variable to the result of a terminal command within an applescript <body> I'm trying to make a script that ejects all connected external drives and does not move on until they are all disconnected.  The main problem I'm having is being able to set the variable codevol_count/code to the result of the following script:  precodetell application "Terminal"     cd /Volumes     ls | wc -l end tell /code/pre  I also have not tested that script, but I assume that's how you run a terminal command from within an applescript.  Follow up question:  How would I then have it eject all but two disks (my hard drive is partitioned into two disks)?  precodeon run {}      tell application "Finder"         set vol_count to do shell script "cd /Volumes; ls | wc -l"          eject the disks          repeat until vol_count is equal to 2             set vol_count to do shell script "cd /Volumes; ls | wc -l"         end repeat     end tell end run /code/pre  <answer77434> That is not how you run a terminal command in AppleScript. Try something like  precodeset myvar to do shell script "ls ~" /code/pre  <answer77435> You can do something like this:  precodeset vol_count to do shell script "cd /Volumes; ls | wc -l" /code/pre  <answer77442> try:  precodeset dontEject to {"Mac OS X", "Time Machine", "Media", "home", "net"} set myDisks to list disks  repeat with aDisk in myDisks     if aDisk is not in dontEject then tell application "Finder" to eject aDisk end repeat /code/pre  <comment89756> This is the best answer. <comment89758> Wow, thanks! That's perfect!
