Resource consumption of continuous listen speakable items? <body> How computationally intensive is speakable items when it's continually listening for input?  I think it's fun to use and actually sometimes useful to use for commands (like when my hands are full or whatnot). Using the button input won't be so worthwhile to me because I most often would want to use it from the other side of the room when I'm doing something else. Yet, I only would probably use the voice commands once every other day. So if it uses up any substainial amount of resources, heats the processor up and uses more electricity, or simply makes my computer wear itself out a little faster then I don't really want to have it on always. However, if the consumption is so miniscule that it really doesn't matter, then I'll just always leave it on.  I did some very simple test of turning it off and on and watching the activity monitor, but I didn't see much. Has anyone looked into this a bit more thoroughly? Thanks!
