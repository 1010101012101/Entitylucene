Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 <body> What is the best way to connect a device with a Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) port to a computer (MacBook Pro) with a Thunderbolt 2 port?  I understand there will not be full 40 Gbps speed.  Device is a http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BL0CKIM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_D1BFxb33TZ5ZM  <answer273311> All day long I was looking for the same Thunderbold 3 to Thunderbold 2 adapter in order to be able to connect my new USB Type-C Devices to my "old" MacBook Pro. Meaning something like the inverse of:br https://www.amazon.de/Apple-MMEL2ZM-A-Thunderbolt-Adapter/dp/B01M72VEQR/ref=pd_sbs_147_17?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=3WQZ4QYVZ7BBWCF73R4X  The only thing I could find matching my needs:br https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adapter-Maxhood-Macbook-ChromeBook-CFM-3-0M/dp/B01BYG75WY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487262986&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=usbc+female br in addition to:br https://www.amazon.co.uk/KANEX-Thunderbolt-eSATA-USB-Adapter/dp/B00LOLBBQQ%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q%26tag%3Dduckduckgo-osx-uk-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00LOLBBQQ  To me, if I am not missing anything, this looks like there can be a solution. At least from the technical side.  <answer273322> There isn't really many alternatives on the market. USB-C to Mini DisplayPort exists, but not many with Thunderbolt 3/2 support.  Apple makes a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 which is supposed to be bidirectional (read more in this support article). In that case you would probably need a Thunderbolt 2 male-to-male cable, but it should work in theory.  <comment302024> What make and model and type of device? <comment302025> Not exactly sure what I'm going to order yet. I'm looking at this to see if it's even possible first, or whether I have to look in another direction. <comment302036> Since there is no Apple hardware or software, this is strictly off-topic for the site, but let's indulge ourselves a bit and see if someone wants to find the thunderbolt specification that explains how you cannot just plug thunderbolt 3 physically into thunderbolt 2 due to pinout and physical size mismatches. <comment302038> @bmike the apple hardware would be the MacBook Pro, and I'm fully aware that the plugs are different. This is why I would like to know if an adapter exists. And the device on the other end is https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BL0CKIM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_D1BFxb33TZ5ZM <comment302040> A friend of mine has it and loves it. So I'd like to use it if I can. But if its not possible I'll look into other options <comment302043> That's an awesome unit - edit those details into the post, please : - ) <comment340594> My reason for needing something like this is that I want to get a T3 dock so that I don't need to upgrade it a few years from now when I get a USB-C/T3 MacBook (Pro), but my current computer only has T2. Really hoping this adapter exists, but I haven't found *anything* so far. <comment343596> It sais:  ```The Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn't support connections to these devices: [...] MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015) and later``` <comment343896> @cocoseis Yes, I suppose that means it doesn't support 12-inch MacBooks. Should still work for MB Pro or Air I believe.
