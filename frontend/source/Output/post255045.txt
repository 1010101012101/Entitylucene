Macbook Pro renders font differently then other screen <body> This is the font looks on my friend's Macbook Pro: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJMJ9.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is the font looks on my computer with DELL U2412M monitor: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fKIxe.png" alt="enter image description here"  They look different, the first one looks smooth and the second one looks blurry.  Anyone have insight on this?  <answer255048> It looks different because your Macbook and the Dell does not get the same resolution. Your Macbook should display 1280*800 or 2560 x 1600 or other, and the Dell displays 1900*1200. The ratio is not the same, it has to be stretched.  <answer255049> Macbook Pro might have a retina display, that's why it's smoother then the monitor.  <comment317603> How old is the Macbook Pro? Does it has a retina display? This means it will be way smoother then the monitor.
