Setting up iCloud results in cloudd error messages <body> I am trying to set up iCloud on my work laptop (profile managed in an active directory domain from what I can tell).  It seems to be mostly going fine, but all of the icons stay grayed out:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/axVCg.png" width="463"  Re-entering the password doesn't change this.  The console log is filled with these (about every minute or so):  precode10/9/15 9:04:28.985 AM cloudd[714]: Couldn't create a PCS identity: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-25300 "The operation couldn’t be completed.

It seems to be user-specific; i.e., not related to the iCloud account as the same iCloud account used under a different (system) user will not experience the problem and a different iCloud account used under the same (system) user will experience the problem.   I'm getting slightly different console messages, but yeah, they're all about PCS identity creation failures, keyset decoding failures &amp; blah blah blah.   I had a bit of a brain-wave &amp; just checked under ~/Library/Logs in Console and lo &amp; behold, there are a heap of ProtectedCloudStorage-SignIn logs.

(OSStatus error -25244 - SecItem failed to delete on private identity) /code/pre  It looks like iCloudHelper is having trouble with the PCS Identity for some reason. Hopefully someone who knows a bit more about these things may shed some more light on this.  <answer238884> My suspicions are still that it has got to do something with my keychain but I couldn’t figure out what exactly was wrong.  I finally fixed it by signing out, then signing in again with a different iCloud account, signing out again, and, at last, signing in with my original account.  (Before using a different account, signing in with my original account would log me out immediately after logging me in.)  <comment253624> I'm assuming since you mentioned AD that this is a work machine. It may be possible that your company is restricting iCloud at the firewall and/or via system policies of some kind. You may want to ask someone if they are indeed blocking <comment253645> I asked before and they said there are no limitations in place <comment274919> This matches my experience. I can add one other datapoint, that the issue started after enabling iCloud Drive on the affected machine. Other machines are not affected. It appears to be some odd interaction between the iCloud Keychain and iCloud Drive folders. No solution so far. <comment286837> I have this too, on two machines (one on Yosemite, one on El Capitan). First I thought it was connected to the fact that I do weird things with my keychain (use a different name than “login” for the default, sync it across multiple macs, have a different password than my login password) but even a fresh keychain didn’t solve the problem. On one of these machines I tried logging out of iCloud completely and now I can’t get back on… It does a few things to the keychain and then signs me out again before anything shows up.
