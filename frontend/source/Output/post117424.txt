Replaced LCD/Digitizer iPhone-4 works but intermittently blacks out frequently <body> Just replaced the LCD/Digitizer on my iPhone4 the screen works fine. Then, it gets fuzzy after some time and then blacks out. Then I have to lock the screen, then unlock, the picture comes back to normal. The picture only lasts for about a few seconds before it gets fuzzy and blacks out and i have to repeat the process.   I've:   ol liReset the phone/li liReseated the cables onto the logic board/li liReadjusted that yellow tape on the LCD cable/li liCleaned the connections to make sure there was no dust/li /ol  One thing to note: on the digitizer i got a few specs of dust on the mirrored side, does that matter? Will that cause the picture to be inconsistent? Help!
