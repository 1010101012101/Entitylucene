Determining OS X version from Time Machine backup <body> I have Time Machine backups from my iMac Early 2008 (20"). Can I determine from those backups what OS X version was running on the machine at the time of latest backup?  <answer175528> Just open the file    precode/Volumes/BackupVolumeName/BackupName.ext/ComputerName/latest/VolumeName/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist /code/pre  to determine the product version ("latest" is a sym-link).   BackupName.ext, BackupVolumeName, ComputerName and VolumeName are all variable and depend on the type of backup or the names configured/given to your backup volume, Mac and main system volume. BackupName.ext is often emBackups.backupdb/em though.  Here is my SystemVersion.plist (it's the original file and not a file in a  backup) opened in PlistEdit Pro. You may also open it with an arbitrary text editor or Xcode:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAwqo.jpg" alt="SystemVersion.plist"  <answer175529> Yes you can look at the value of the strongProductVersion/strong in the strongSystemVersion.plist/strong file located at, e.g., code/Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/&lt;ComputerName&gt;/yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss/Macintosh HD/System/Library/CoreServices//code.  The strongSystemVersion.plist/strong is an XML plist file so, you can just open it in TextEdit, if you do not have a strong.plist/strong editor and you'll see as an example:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProductVersion&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;10.8.5&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  <answer250665> Perfect information. One little addition. If you've got a really big monitor (as I do) you can read the SystemVersion.plist file just by clicking it and looking at the "carousel" preview in the Finder window.
