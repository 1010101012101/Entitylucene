Add Compose key to OS X <body> I want to change one of my keys on my keyboard to a Compose key so I can easily type common accents or characters, e.g.: kbdCompose/kbd+kbde/kbd+kbd'/kbd - é.  Is there a setting I can change or a program I can install to add this feature? For instance, I would like to use kbdCaps Lock/kbd as kbdCompose/kbd.  <answer31488> A "dead keys" feature similar to what you want already exists by default. To get the letter é, press kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbde/kbd, then kbde/kbd.   After pressing kbd⌥/kbd+kbde/kbd, you'll see a code´/code character highlighted (it's yellow on my computer). Press any letter that will take that accent mark (this will vary based on your keyboard language, for EN-US it's é, ú, í, ó, and á) and you'll get the accented version of the letter. There are other accents possible: kbd⌥/kbd+kbd`/kbd gives an agrave accent (```), kbd⌥/kbd+kbde/kbd gives an acute accent (´), kbd⌥/kbd+kbdu/kbd gives a diaeresis/umlaut (¨), kbd⌥/kbd+kbdi/kbd gives a circumflex accent (ˆ), and kbd⌥/kbd+kbdn/kbd gives a tilde (˜). Non-US keyboard layouts (in particular Welsh) have more accents and allow more letters for the same accents. The Keyboard Viewer is useful to help figure out what combinations are currently supported on your layout.  If you are on Lion, as @djacobson mentioned, you can hold down some letters to see a variety of accented options for that letter.   <answer31489> If you want to remap one of your keys, take a look at KeyRemap4MacBook, which is referenced in this SU post. The documentation notes that kbdCaps Lock/kbd can be remapped, and custom mappings are also supported.  <answer54424> I wrote a complete article explaining how to set up a real compose key (emie./em kbdRight Option/kbd + kbd'/kbd + kbde/kbd → codeé/code for instance), using a combination of KeyRemap4MacBook and specific Cocoa input rules.  h2Step 1: choose a Compose key/h2  Choose the Compose key so that it is easily accessible but does not prevent you from doing anything you ordinarily do. I use the kbdRight Option/kbd key as my Compose key. I already have a kbdLeft Option/kbd key so the right one is a bit useless to me. And it somehow matches the position of the kbdCompose/kbd key on old Sun keyboards.  That would be kbdRight Option/kbd on a Mac keyboard. I recommend that.  h2Step 2: remap the Compose key/h2  The problem is that the Mac OS X keyboard preferences:  ul lido not let you differentiate between kbdLeft Option/kbd and kbdRight Option/kbd keys/li lionly let you remap modifier keys to another modifier key (or to nothing)/li /ul  Fortunately, there is KeyRemap4MacBook that lets you do very low level things with your keyboard. Install it.  We will now remap our compose key to something that the next layer will understand. I chose kbdShift/kbd kbdControl/kbd kbdF13/kbd for that. It is very unlikely you will need that key combination.  In the file code~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml/code put the following:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Send Shift-Ctrl-F13 for Right Option&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.send_shift_ctrl_f13_for_ropt&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::OPTION_R,                           KeyCode::F13, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L                                       | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Finally, from the strongSystem Preferences/strong, open the strongKeyRemap4MacBook/strong settings and click on the strongReloadXML/strong button. Then activate the new option.  h2Step 3: create compose bindings/h2  The last step is the creation of the actual bindings. I chose to import the rules from code/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose/code on my Debian system.  Bob Kåres wrote a script that lets you convert X11 compose rules into Cocoa key bindings.  Either convert a codeCompose/code file of your own using Bob’s script, or download my DefaultKeyBinding.dict from the article. Save it in code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code.  Be careful: by default Bob’s script uses kbdF13/kbd instead of kbdShift/kbd kbdCtrl/kbd kbdF13/kbd so in codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code you need to change:  precode"\UF710" /code/pre  into:  precode"^$\UF710" /code/pre  If for some reason you decided to go for another combination, check out this article by Xah Lee to find out the proper syntax.  <answer62232> h2Compose key on dedicated keyboard layout/h2  I have written U.S. custom, a keyboard layout that implements the compose key.  On Mac OS X, there are two ways of implementing the compose key: Either with  can be implemented either with the Cocoa text system (as already described in Sam Hocevar's most helpful answer) or with a dedicated keyboard layout. Both methods have their pros and cons:  ul liA compose key implementation with the strongCocoa text system/strong will work independently of the chosen keyboard layout. The Cocoa text system settings in the codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code file are, by comparison, easily modified./li liA compose key implementation with a strongkeyboard layout/strong will work all over the OS in any application, not just in Cocoa applications. It can be switched on and off with the UI by selecting another keyboard layout. There is a visual feedback while typing the compose combination (which slightly changes the behaviour)./li /ul  The installation of the keyboard layout is easy:  ol liDownload and open uscustom.2012-08-28.zip./li liMove the files codeUScustom.keylayout/code and codeUScustom.icns/code to either of:  ul licode/Library/Keyboard Layouts//code (for all users)/li licode~/Library/Keyboard Layouts//code (just for you, no administrator privileges required)/li /ul/li liActivate the emU.S. custom/em keyboard layout in the emInput Sources/em tab of the emLanguage &amp; Text/em Preference Pane, so you can then select it from the input sources menu bar item – its icon shows a U.S. flag with a little C for “custom” or for “compose”: U.S. custom icon http://uscustom.sourceforge.net/html-files/favicon.png./li /ol  The compose key of the U.S. custom keyboard layout is mapped to two different keys:  ul liThere is a compose key at ISO kbd§/kbd (that is the surplus key of an ISO keyboard; ISO keyboards are the ones where the return key is shaped like a turned capital letter L)./li liThere is another compose key at kbdShift/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdF13/kbd. This is the same mapping as chosen by Sam Hocevar, so if you want to remap the compose key to you right option key, then you can exactly follow the careful explanations described in his answer./li /ul  h2Assigning compose to capslock/h2  If you want to assign compose to the capslock key (as in the original question), you need Takayama Fumihiko’s PCKeyboardHack in addition to KeyRemap4MacBook:  ol liInstall PCKeyboardHack./li liOpen the PCKeyboardHack preference pane./li liCheck the emChange Caps Lock/em checkbox./li liDoubleclick on the emkeycode/em of emChange Caps Lock/em and enter code10/code (ISO kbd§/kbd)./li /ol  This works with the emU.S. custom/em keyboard layout compose key. In order to assign the Cocoa text system compose key (as carefully described by Sam Hocevar) to capslock, then you need another step:  With KeyRemap4MacBook, remap the ISO kbd§/kbd to kbdShift/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdF13/kbd (or whereever your compose key is). To do so, follow the steps carefully explained by Sam Hocevar, but changing the code that is to be placed in code~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml/code thisly:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt; &lt;item&gt;   &lt;name&gt;Send Shift-Ctrl-F13 for ISO Section&lt;/name&gt;   &lt;identifier&gt;private.send_shift_ctrl_f13_for_iso_section&lt;/identifier&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;     --KeyToKey--     KeyCode::UK_SECTION, ModifierFlag::NONE,     KeyCode::F13, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L   &lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <answer62269> What's wrong with the default method of accented character input (as of 10.7 Lion)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/beOe2.png" alt=""  Just hold down the letter and a list of alternatives will show.  <comment36108> If you're on OS X Lion, holding down a letter key will, by default, give you a list of common, accented characters from which you can pick using the number keys. <comment36109> Only in certain applications. And only the ones that Apple has chosen for you which tends to be incomplete. <comment37099> This question (and answer) is also related:  http://superuser.com/questions/202695/real-compose-key-on-mac-os <comment62304> The content of the link looks like a great solution to this problem, but answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link.

It works again. <comment254653> I've added my custom .XCompose file I use on Linux to make emoji characters to the default Compose file and run it through Bob's script. I had to comment out `use strict` to get it to run, but the output looks okay. However, when typing the sequence I've set to make for example `\U1F61E` "disappointed face"  it comes out as `ὡE`. The line in question is: `"\U0028" = ("insertText:", "\U1F61E"); /* Compose, COLON, LEFT PARENTHESIS: DISAPPOINTED FACE */` -- any idea what's wrong? <comment254666> @tremby this is because `\U1F61` followed by `E` is interpreted as `ὡ` followed by `E`. Maybe try to replace `"\U1F61E"` with a string containing the character itself: `""`. Otherwise, you will have to use the UTF-16 sequence, *i.e.* `"\UD83D\UDE1E"` (the UTF-16 representation can be computed or found [on several websites such as fileformat.info](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f61e/index.htm)). <comment254709> Switching for the character itself works; thanks. I wonder why it (what: OS X? Karabiner?) Doesn't recognize longer codepoints. <comment254711> @tremby It’s by design in OS X; the file format uses UTF-16. <comment254715> Ah, then perhaps Bob's script needs to be fixed to print out UTF-16? My input to it (my .XCompose file) is the raw character. <comment290690> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_make_dashes <comment290691> http://superuser.com/questions/538964/where-can-i-find-a-keyboard-viewer-for-mac-os-x   and press the left Alt key on it
