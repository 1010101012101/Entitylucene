Cut two pages by Preview at once <body> When scanning documents, many pages in a row have the same problem. An example where a lot of white empty space in the corner: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLwG0.png" alt="enter image description here"  The application Preview allows selecting the area in a row along the two pages. However, when choosing to cut, only the page where you started get cropped. I think this is a bug in design and should be fixed. In the example, there are 277 pages. It takes hours of time if I cannot crop pages in a row.  strongIs there any way to cut pages in a row in Preview or other applications?/strong  <answer110470> Yes, this can be achieved solely with Preview.  ol liShow page thumbnails by clicking strongThumbnails/strong from the View Menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUUSh.png" width="185"/li liShow the strongEdit/strong toolbar, and choose the strongRectangular Selection/strong tool.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjSfH.png" width="312"/li liSelect the rectangle that you want to crop each page to./li lih3Select (⌘-click) all the pages that you want to crop in the page thumbnails./h3  The pages don't have to be sequential, and you can select all pages with ⌘A./li liClick strongCrop/strong in the toolbar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/avQ9I.png" width="56"/li /ol  <comment100628> I'd be happy to try cutting things using [PDF Pen Pro](http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpenPro/index.html). Can you upload a few pages of a sample document so I can verify it easily does what I assume it would do - let you edit and perhaps even script the cropping of pages. <comment130139> Can you crop multiple pages with this at once? This is the problem, not only one page. <comment130140> @Masi Yes you can, I have used this method for ages :) <comment130641> Yes, I did. Thank you very much for your tip! Do you know how you can reverse the change after you save and close the document? <comment130642> You lose the metada about Search-function, which is the negative side effect, but it does not matter because you can run text-recognition after cropping again. <comment130692> @Masi Since the change overwrites the file, the only way to recover it is if you have Time Machine (local backups are sufficient - go to Browse Previous Versions) or Dropbox previous versions, or if you have a copy of the original files. <comment141409> somewhat on topic, please use "command-shift-4" (release all, than) "space-bar" for proper screenshots.
