Change LG UltraFine resolution through AppleScript <body> I would like to have an AppleScript that toggles between "Default for display" in System Preferences and "Scaled" "Larger Text".  The script should detect the current state of the display and toggle to the other state (i.e., if in Default for display, switch to scaled larger text).  I gut this far with my script (that I got from this site and this stackexchange page), but it seems that I can't get to virtually "click" left most icon out of the five available ones:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.displays"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane id "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell  local indexToUse  -- Now lets make the necessary changes tell application "System Events"     tell tab group 1 of window "LG UltraFine" of application process "System Preferences" of application "System Events"         tell radio group 1              if (value of radio button "Scaled") = 0 then                 -- Click the "Scaled" radio button                 click radio button "Scaled"                  tell radio group 2                     click radio button 1 of radio group 2                 end tell              else                 click radio button "Default for display"             end if         end tell      end tell end tell  -- Quit "System Preferences" quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  When running the script, if System Preferences are in "Default for display", I get the following Script Error: codeSystem Events got an error: Can’t get radio group 2 of radio group 1 of tab group 1 of window "LG UltraFine" of application process "System Preferences". Invalid index./code  I would like to be able to click on the button circled in red in the attached screenshot. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XAXjq.png" alt="Screenshot of System Preferences → Displays → Scaled"  <answer294631> This works on my MacBook Pro running the latest version of Sierra.  I just substituted "Built in Retina display" with yours. I think it should work for you.  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences" to tell window "LG UltraFine"     click radio button "Scaled" of radio group 1 of tab group 1     click radio button 1 of radio group 1 of group 1 of tab group 1     delay 0.1 -- adjust this value as needed if you get a message that you need to click "ok".     click button "OK" of sheet 1 -- on my MBP, choosing the lowest resolution displays a message that I need to click "ok".

In Automator, start A “Watch me do recording” and when you are finished recording, select all of the steps in the recorded action and menu item Edit/Copy.  Then switch over to the ScriptEditor and make a new document and “Paste” what you copied from Automator into the new document.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bUl5t.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dUbwx.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can compile the script and run it if you would like.  More importantly though, it will show you the exact names of your UI elements (tab 1, scroll area, etc.) That you can use to substitute into the code I posted earlier.  <answer295211> Thanks to @wch1zpink and the suggestion to use the codeWatch Me Do/code option in Automator, here is a script that finally seems to do the job:  precode-- Portions of the script found on https://gist.github.com/mvaneijgen/2f48f859ca07d2e75b3a -- Launch "System Preferences", open the "Displays" options and change to the "Display" tab (* If error "System Events got an error: Script Editor is not allowed assistive access" appears, then System Preferences → Security &amp; Privacy → Privacy → add Script Editor to "Allow the app to control your computer"*) (* as per: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31019916/is-not-allowed-for-assistive-access-error-when-running-applescript-from-java) *)  tell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane id "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell  -- Now lets make the necessary changes tell application "System Events"     tell tab group 1 of window "LG UltraFine" of application process "System Preferences" of application "System Events"         tell radio group 1              if (value of radio button "Scaled") = 0 then -- Check if Scaled radio button is not selected                 click radio button "Scaled" -- Click the "Scaled" radio button                  -- and click on the icon above "Larger Text" (which is in fact a radio button)                 tell application "System Events"                     tell tab group 1 of window "LG UltraFine" of application process "System Preferences" of application "System Events"                         tell radio group 1 of group 2                             click radio button 1                         end tell                     end tell                 end tell                  else -- Scaled radio button is already selected                     click radio button "Default for display" -- therefore click on "Default for display"             end if         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment371772> Feel free to ask your follow on question - that could stand as a new thread. <comment371775> To answer the now deleted bonus question, `tell application "System Events" to get every UI element of window 1 of application process "System Preferences"` and then e.g. `tell application "System Events" to get properties of radio button 1 of window 1 of application process "System Preferences"` where `radio button 1` can be that or `radio button "Left"` and other designators, e.g. `radio button 2` or `radio button "Bottom"`, etc. <comment371906> @pdeli Just using the reveal command for system preferences and omitting activate, runs the script in the background without bringing system preferences to the front <comment371953> Thanks for your answer. However, when trying the scripts you uploaded, all of them give the same Script Error: `System Events got an error: Can’t get radio group 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of window "LG UltraFine" of process "System Preferences". Invalid index.`  The "Result" pane in Script Editor reads: `error "System Events got an error: Can’t get radio group 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of window \"LG UltraFine\" of process \"System Preferences\". Invalid index." number -1719 from radio group 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of window "LG UltraFine" of process "System Preferences"` <comment371954> @user3439894 Thank you for your answer. I tried your script, but for a strange reason AS does not seem to return the results for the "buttons" between the Scaled radio button and the "Larger texte – More Space" (I cannot stick the result given by AS because it is too long). However, as has been suggested by bmike who edited my post, I will open another thread for this "issue". Thanks again. <comment371955> @wch1zpink Thank you for your remark. You are completely right and I intended in doing what you suggest. However, I thought having the app appear would perhaps help me for "debugging"… Thanks again for your suggestion. <comment372686> Just an FYI... When using `reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane id "com.apple.preference.displays"` the line of code above it, `set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.displays"`, is totally needless.  Also, why is `local indexToUse` there? It's not used at all. <comment372727> @user3439894: Thank you for your remarks. Both `set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.displays"` and `local indexToUse` were in the original script found at the web address mentioned at the beginning of the code. In indeed tried the script by commenting out those lines and it works perfectly. Thanks again…
