How to make and use an USB stick with GParted that will boot on a Mac? <body> I want to create a USB stick with GParted on it that will be recognized by my Mac. Obviously, I want to emcreate/em it on a Mac, also. This is not mentioned in the documentation here.   <answer271740> I will answer my own question. Since I had a lot of trouble creating Live USBs on Ubuntu and Mac and wanted to dig a bit deeper into the subject and will also list the output of the successful partition schemes.  ul liDownload .iso from here under "stable releases". If unsure, chose the 32bit-Version./li liPut a USB stick in the slot and look into Disk Utility for its device number (disk1, disk2, diskX, etc). This can be found by clicking the icon "Info"./li liOpen up a shell/li liUnmount the stick in terminal (nowhere else) with codesudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX/code/li /ul  strongMake sure you don't codedd/code to a wrong disk, e.g. your working HDD!/strong  ul liCopy the downloaded file with codesudo dd BS=1m if=file.iso of=/dev/rdiskX/code /li /ul  We use the emr/em for emraw/em in codeof=/dev/rdiskX/code to make the copy faster.  The USB stick then looks like this with codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *7.8 GB     disk1    1:                       0xEF                         3.0 MB     disk1s2 /code/pre  hr  codesudo gdisk -l /dev/diskX/code will show this (aborting the question is possible with kbdctrl/kbdkbdC/kbd):  precodeGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Partition table scan:   MBR: MBR only   BSD: not present   APM: not present   GPT: present  Found valid MBR and GPT.

Clicking emIgnore/em is safe. I put the German screenshot in, I think it's pretty clear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTlN9.png" alt="dialog upon inserting USB stick"  When booting the Mac now press kbdalt/kbd and there should be an option to boot to that is called codeEFI boot/code. This will bring up GParted Live.  But beware, there are some Macs (e.g. Macbook Pro 17" Early 2011 that are not able at all to boot anything other from USB than OS X).
