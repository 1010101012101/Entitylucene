use cable box external drive for time machine backups <body> I have a cable box that has usb ports. I plugged in an external hdd to one of the usb ports and I can access it from my mac book pro (yosemite) using ftp.  I would like to use this drive for my time machine backups since I don't want to plug in my hdd to my laptop every few days.  I tried transmit to mount the drive but time machine doesn't recognize it as an external drive.  Any way to make this work?  <comment189046> Time Machine needs AFP, not SMB. Have you checked your sharing prefs? Can this box handle AFP?
