Shake to Undo stopped working on my iPhone <body> What can I do to fix "Shake to Undo" on my iOS device? Could this be a hardware issue or software issue?  <answer296324> You should always try an "Erase All Content and Settings" operation on your device before seeking service for something that may or may not be a hardware issue. Also shaking your phone can provide other actions in some apps besides Undo and that might be worth trying to determine where the issue is. But before you do that strongtoggling "Shake to Undo" in the accessibility settings/strong fixed it for me.  <comment374263> If you want to beef up the answer to explain what a “clean reset” is - please flag this for reopening - as it stands, it’s likely to get a lot of other answers. Maybe when you accept yours that will help too
