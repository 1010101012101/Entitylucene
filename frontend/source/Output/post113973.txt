Is there a way to log outbound HTTP requests that pass through my Airport Extreme? <body> My wireless router is an Airport Extreme.  I would like to log all outbound HTTP requests (leaving my Mac for an internet web server) for later review.  Is that possible?  <answer114009> I would suggest you to install Squid  HTTP Proxy through Brew Package manager  Squid is a HTTP Proxy and will log and cache all strongBrowser/strong requests passing through it.Since we are installing Squid on your Mac, it will log only the one's passing through it.  Procedure :  ol  liInstall Brew using Terminal.app /li li Make sure Brew is ready to be used by used by running following command: /li  $b brew doctor /b br If not ready follow the instructions.  (Generally this requires you to upgrade XCode to latest version.   liInstall Squid/li  b$ brew update && brew install squid /b  liPoint your Browser  to use Proxy localhost:3128/li /ol  <comment133688> So, @Garfield Carneiro, if a 2nd Mac in my house uses my Airport, would the proxy record its HTTP requests?  I suppose it would if I pointed it at the proxy?  And if I did that, the 2nd Mac would only be able access the internet if the first Mac was on? <comment133792> Yes. The computer which has Squid  installed has to be switched on as well as [configured](http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch32_:_Controlling_Web_Access_with_Squid)  to accept requests from other computer as well. <comment133793> If you are not comfortable configuring Squid, you could perhaps use a GUI programs like [SquidMan](http://squidman.net/squidman/) , [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com/) [etc](https://www.google.com/search?q=http%20proxy%20for%20mac), though I have never used any GUI configuration tools myself.
