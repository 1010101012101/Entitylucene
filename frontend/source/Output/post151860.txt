Empty iCloud Drive folder in Yosemite? <body> In OS X Yosemite, my "iCloud Drive" folder is always empty.  My Macbook is running Yosemite, and my iPhone and iPad are running iOS8. I have gone through the iCloud Drive migration process and it does work on my iOS devices - along with iCloud.com.  I tried turning iCloud Drive off and on, but that doesn't fix it. Nor does completely signing out of iCloud and signing back in. (With reboots in between every step)  Short of a re-install, is there anything else I might be able to try to get my iCloud Drive in working order?  Thanks.  <answer151864> I was also concerned with having nothing in my iCloud drive. Turned out to be that I just had no apps that stored data in it. Try running pages and saving a doc in the cloud, see if it appears.  <answer217649> Do you run firewall software?  If you do, check if you're blocking calls frombr the nsurlsessiond to the amazonaws.com domain.    <comment178709> I have docs in iCloud drive that appear on my other devices as well as iCloud.com. Both docs from apps, as well as files I've manually added. They show up everywhere except Yosemite. <comment178799> I see. Unfortunately I don't know anyone who experienced such issue. I suggest asking apple support, this may be something obscure. <comment281641> With iCloud disabled, delete the iCloud folder, restart the Mac and re-enable iCloud. What happens?
