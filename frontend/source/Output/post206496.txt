In iOS 9, where is the "Usage" function in Settings? <body> In iOS8's Settings page, I used to be able to go to "General" then "Usage" and it would tell me how much free space is available on the device, and how much space each app uses.  Where is this now in iOS9?  <answer206497> It has moved to a little different location. To access the same screen, go to: Settings  General  Storage &amp; iCloud Usage  Manage Storage  Moreover, iOS9 now has a search function inside "Settings". A user can search for a term, such as "Usage" in the search bar to access the corresponding settings.  <answer219865> For iOS9 users the app size can be checked from Settinggeneralstorage &amp; icloud usages  <comment248923> This is great!
