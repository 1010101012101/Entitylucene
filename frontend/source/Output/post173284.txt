List of preinstalled Python packages in Yosemite? <body> I have installed many python packages via codesudo pip install/code and some of them have messed up the system by overwriting or updating preloaded python packages. Now I want to revert all the damage done and install my own packages only in a codevirtualenv/code. Is there any way I can obtain a list of python packages, preferably with their version, that comes with a clean Yosemite?  <answer173285> ul lipip (1.5.6)/li lisetuptools (5.4.2)/li liwsgiref (0.1.2)/li /ul  Yosemite 10.10.2  <comment203812> These are definitely not the only ones. I remember at least `PyOpenSSL`, `xattr` and a lot of `pyobjc-XXX`. I don't remember all of them, though. <comment203813> And `pip` is not preinstalled. <comment203814> @Siyuan Interestingâ€”I ran my VM with a fresh snapshot and ran `sudo pip list` and these were the only three I got. `pip freeze` lists wsgiref only. What should I run to list them all? <comment203817> Eh, I don't know how you obtain the snapshot, but a fresh Yosemite does not have `pip`. It has only `easy_install`. Mind sharing how you install Yosemite on a VM? <comment203818> @Siyuan I used Parallels Desktop which uses the Recovery HD to install OS X in the VM. PD isn't free though and I haven't had much experience with other VM software. <comment203823> There are approximately 5000 files in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib and nothing in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages - do you have any other directories in $PYTHONPATH and/or by printing sys.path from the interpreter? <comment203824> I'm seeing what @SiyuanRen is seeing - the only Apple provided pip I get is when installing server.app from the MAS.
