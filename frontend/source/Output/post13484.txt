Messages issued by syslog not showing up in system logs <body> I'm having some trouble with code&lt;syslog.h&gt;/code in 10.5. I'm writing a small fork based server for class and I want to use codesyslog()/code to print a bunch of debug info. However, I can't find any of the messages I issue via codesyslog()/code while using Console (I'm looking in both all messages &amp; codesystem.log/code).  Here is a code snippet of a plain C:  precode#include &lt;syslog.h&gt; #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;  int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {     openlog("Syslog Test", LOG_PID | LOG_NDELAY | LOG_CONS | LOG_PERROR, LOG_USER);     setlogmask(LOG_UPTO(LOG_DEBUG));     syslog(LOG_DEBUG, "%s", "Hello, World!");     syslog(LOG_DEBUG, "%s", "And goodbye!");     closelog();     return 0; } /code/pre  And I don't see anything in "All Messages", "Console Messages" or codesystem.log/code. Any advice?  <answer13537> Despite what you pass to codesetlogmask()/code, in its default configuration, OS X will only write messages to the system log that have a priority of codeLOG_NOTICE/code or higher.  Any of the following will solve your problem...  ol liEnable lower-priority logging in code/etc/syslog.conf/code -- codekern.*/code is not enough, as log messages from Xcode are not coming from the kernel/li liChange the priority of your messages from codeLOG_DEBUG/code to codeLOG_NOTICE/code/li liSimply use the built-in Xcode console -- the output will always appear there regardless of your codesyslog.conf/code settings/li /ol  Here's what it looks like in the built-in Xcode 4 console:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ocdiq.png" alt="Xcode console"  Also, if you're developing exclusively for OS X, you might want to look into ASL (Apple System Log), which was meant to replace codesyslog()/code.  <comment14280> Do you have syslog configured (/etc/syslog.conf) to accept debug entries? <comment14341> It accepts debug entries from the kernal. <comment14376> I've heard of ASL, but I forgot to mention that for the purpose of the class I need to have my code be portable to Linux. <comment14379> I've also been using `LOG_CONS` and `LOG_PERROR` to dump my syslogs to the terminal I am using (Xcode & Terminal). <comment25662> Ok, so what I ended up doing for the class was just to use syslog to dump everything to the terminals I was running my server and clients from, and then save the results.  I should have clarified that in the class, we were going strictly with POSIX APIs.
