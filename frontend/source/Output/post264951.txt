Message "kernel[0]: IOATAController device blocking bus." after standby <body> After standby mode my Mac Pro (Early 2008, OSX 10.11.6) produces tons of the following message in system.log:   codekernel[0]: IOATAController device blocking bus./code   I'm pretty sure it's caused by the internal DVD Superdrive, because it stops working at the same time. After reboot the Superdrive is working again and the error in the logs disappears.  Anybody an idea why standby mode causes the problem and how to fix it?
