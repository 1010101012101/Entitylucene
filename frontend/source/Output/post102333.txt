Difficulty deleting music from music library on my iPhone <body> I'm having difficulty managing music in my iTunes library on my phone. I have old songs that I do not want anymore that are still showing up with the iCloud symbol (ready to download) in my library. Even going to settings to hide certain downloaded music, the songs I do not want still appear (just without the iCloud symbol) and cannot be deleted. I want to completely get rid of some songs. Help.  <answer102788> I was having the same problem. I went into strongSettings/strong on my iPhone and to strongMusic/strong. Towards the bottom it says strongShow All Music/strong. I just disabled that and it solved my problem.  <answer141921> I had the same problem go to settingsmusicshow all music and slide the button over. Hope this helped!  <answer269546> At first, hide all iTunes Music tracks. Go to Settings  Music  Show All Music and turning it off.  Find the track you wish to delete and long-press the song cover and you'll be presented with options - one of which is to 'Delete from Library'. Tap on this option and you'll be asked to confirm the deletion. That's it.   <comment120500> Please can you update your question with details of your device/OS level etc.
