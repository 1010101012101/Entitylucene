How to prevent Windows 10 from downloading and installing updates before the Boot Camp Support Software is installed? <body> Microsoft is allowing users to download and install (but not activate) Windows 10 Pro 64 bit without using a Product key.   I tried doing a clean install of Windows 10 on my mid 2007, 20 inch iMac. During installation, I was not asked if I wanted to disable Windows Update. Windows ended up downloading drivers before I could install the Boot Camp software. Some of the drivers installed but most failed.   Is there a way to install the Boot Camp software before updates are downloaded?br Or, can updating be disabled during the Windows 10 installation?  <answer198740> Where to start…? …   This is the current picture as I understand it, &amp; may be subject to change/correction  To get your 'free' Win 10 you must upgrade an existing activated installation, otherwise you will have to enrol in the Insider Program when it reopens to continue to use it [or keep installing fresh every month to a VM that cannot be identified as being the 'same machine']   If you install clean from the Media Creator tool on an external USB key etc, you may not be able to get past the 'enter a Win 10 key' screen. People have had varying results at that point, some get the 'skip' button, some do not. [I have yet to figure out what causes this difference]  Upgrading an existing Win 7 or 8 OS would also at least keep the existing Boot Camp drivers in place - possibly better than trying to inject outdated drivers after the fact.  There are no Boot Camp drivers yet for Win 10.   Also, unless you are using Win 10 Enterprise [which has no free upgrade path], you cannot switch off automatic updates, only defer them til next reboot.  <answer201716> Below are some basic steps to install the Boot Camp Support Software and configure Windows Update before updates are downloaded from Microsoft.     emWindows Update can only be configured if you are installing Windows 10 Pro or better.

You may want to check if a better choice exists than the default keyboard.  At this point, you can continue with the Windows 10 installation.  h2Additional Notes:/h2  There is a downloadable "Show or hide updates" troubleshooter package from Microsoft, that will allow you to review and/or hide updates before downloading and/or installing. This option is described in an answer to "Stopping automatic updates windows 10".  Personally, I found this software to be unpredictable. I could get the software to hide an update, but I had trouble getting a hidden update to install.  <answer273530> TO prevent windows from updating automatically, you have to make sure that windows update service is disabled. It is very easy to do rather than going through the hassle explained above. Here is the link of the youtube video which explains how to disable windows update services. Check it out : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efm9tQwtBM0  <comment237942> I just assume that when Apple releases Boot Camp drivers for Win 10, they will not work for my iMac. I have always used "Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033" for my 64 bit clean Windows 7 and 8 installs. I did get a 'skip' button twice during the Windows 10 install. Windows 8.1 was installed in a different partition when I installed Windows 10. I don't know if this makes a difference. <comment238730> I guess it is possible to configure Automatic Updates. At a Command Prompt enter `gpedit.msc`, then navigate to "Local Computer Policy-Computer Configuration-Administrative Templates-Windows Components-Windows Updates-Configure Automatic Updates". Any changes are not reflected under "Start menu-Settings-Update & security-Windows Update-Advanced Options" until you manual check for updates. Note: Option 1 has been replaced by the Disabled button. <comment238731> I'm not sure how you would do that before the fact, though. As it stands, if you upgrade an existing installation, you get the option to look for updates at install or not. That still may be your safest bet. <comment238738> When I asked my question, I was not trying to debate whether a clean install is better than an upgrade. Yet, your answer does lead to new questions. Can you do a clean install and activate, if you get Windows 10 from the insider program? <comment238742> You can't activate Insider Previews right now - they blocked all the keys about 2 weeks ago - though you can install them & have them nag your life out with the 'Windows needs activating' overlay, even over movies & fullscreen apps :( No news on when the next round of insiders will be started. BTW - that's why my answer began 'Where to start...' because there's a lot of new info for people to absorb in a short time ;) <comment238756> I did not mention "Preview". I meant the version of Windows 10 currently offered by the inside program. Here is what I have done so far. I download Windows 10 using the `MediaCreationTool64` and installed in a empty partition. I could not activate. Next, I posted my question. Based on your answer, I download Windows 10 from the Window Insider Program and upgraded my Windows 8.1 partition. This installation activated BOTH partitions. My new question just asked if a clean install with Windows 10 from the Inside program would have activated. You answer seemed to indicate it would. <comment238758> I've never tried an Insider Preview as an update, only clean install, so idk the answer to that - other than it seems to have worked for you;) If you do it as a clean install right now, it will not activate, because the keys were all revoked.... unless they changed that policy again in the past few days <comment323200> This is an amazingly in-depth solution. Keep up the good work on Apple.SE! <comment343889> Your answer would be improved if you edited your answer to describe how to do it - that way, if the video is deleted from Youtube your answer will still be useful (and some workplaces block Youtube).
