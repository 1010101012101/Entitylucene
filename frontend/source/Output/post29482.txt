Clearing TEMP files on Mac OSX <body> I'm sure that my Mac is filled with crap by now, being 2 years old. Is there an app that will clear the temp files away? Or is there a list of locations filled with TEMP stuff I can safely delete without killing my Mac?  <answer29491> I suggested to try CleanMyMac.br Features:  ol liCache cleaner/li liLogs cleaner/li liUniversal binaries cleaner/li liSystem junk cleaner/li liLanguage cleaner/li liTrash and leftovers/li liApplication uninstaller/li li.../li /ol  <answer31470> I tried the Beta of CCleaner, and it cleared out 10 GB of stuff, 7GB from the Trash. It's free and worked great  <answer31507> Y u no use OnyX? Free and really popular with really quick updates for every edition of OS X. It has a great feature set and works great for fixing corrupted temp files/caches  <comment33857> OSX does quite a good job in removing temporary files automatically. Do you have something specific in mind? <comment33858> Nope just in general <comment33874> You're joking right? Those guys? The guys that sell their program for $14.99 but only provide a 6 month licence? The same guys that give free copies to people in exchange they post top ratings on places like http://www.macupdate.com/? Those smarmy SOBs? Really? You want to line their pockets and recommend their junk? I wouldn't use their stuff (even if it was good and didn't hose application updates with their daemon) on sheer principle! <comment33875> Give Onyx a try: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11582/onyx <comment33924> maybe you are right, but I didn't know any equivalent to this software! <comment36124> Cause I didn't see it before trying CCleaner. I hate that about the SE inbox <comment146629> What is the reason you're looking to delete temp files? 99% of the time deleting them just because they "seem" unnecessary will slow your system down until they're rebuilt.
