How to keep gmail messages from being sent as iCloud <body> When I intend to send an email from my Gmail account, it sometimes gets sent out with an iCloud suffix, so the recipient may not see it, unless they specifically look in the iCloud folder.     How can I make sure that my email only gets sent out with my gmail suffix?  <comment374171> Would you edit in if you are using a specific device, specific operating system or version as well as what mail client you use? (Assuming you’re not using webmail in a browser to send mail - if that’s the case - that detail would be needed, too) <comment374316> This is an iPhone SE, iOS 10.3.3, using gmail and google chrome.
