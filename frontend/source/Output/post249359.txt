iPhone6s browsers always redirect my links to random spammy websites <body> On all my browsers on my iPhone6s like Safari,Chrome and even facebook browser , when I click on know website link or enter a link direct , it redirect it to random websites like maxonclick ,aigames and other !  I stopped javascript for safari but it's not a solution cause most of websites needs javascript , and I updated my iOS but still the same !  <comment309326> Unless your iPhone is jailbroken, this must either be from a Content blocker (not sure if they can actually redirect), or part of your Network. (Man in the middle, malicious VPN, etc.) <comment309660> No it's not jailbroken , I installed another browser it worked several times then got same malware !!! <comment309745> did you take a look at the other possibilities I mentioned? If it's both in safari and another browser, then it could be malware on your computer affecting your entire network.
