Safari private navigation session <body> Is there any way to stay logged when pressing strongopen in new tabs/strong in safari private mode ?  For example if I'm logged to Facebook in strongtab A/strong  an I use strongOpen in new tabs/strong then I will have to sign into Facebook again.  <comment256571> How is it going to know it's still you, without cookies? That's the entire idea of private browsing. <comment256583> You can think of private as a black box that gets created and have no access to anything you previously done. Also the box gets deleted when the private window is closed. It's like browsing in a totally different browser. <comment256594> Chrome and Firefox allows sharing sessions between tabs in private session. So technechly it's possible but the question can safari do that ?
