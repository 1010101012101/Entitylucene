Ctrl + Cmd + Return doesn't maximize active pane in iTerm2 <body> The split panes functionality is the primary reason why i use iTerm2.  I can maximize/unminimize the active pane by using the View - Maximize Active Pane menu item.  But nothing happens when I press the Ctrl + Cmd + Return shortcut key combination listed next to the menu item.  I looked through the preferences pane and I didn't find this particular key binding anywhere, which makes me think it's not customizable via the UI.  Any suggestions about what might be wrong or how I could go about fixing this?  <answer87144> D'oh; the problem was that I was confusing the Shift key (depicted as ⇧) with the Ctrl key (depicted as ⌃).  So, the correct combination is Shift + Cmd + Return.
