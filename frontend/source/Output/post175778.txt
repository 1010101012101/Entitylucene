Mac terminal prompt's machine name becomes "bogon" after using traceroute <body> I was doing some traceroute test yesterday, and today, my Mac terminal's user prompt becomes   precode`bogon:~ myUserName$` /code/pre  Also when I'm doing traceroute like:  precodetraceroute www.google.com /code/pre  it stops with this log:  precodebogon (192.168.0.1)  1.158 ms  0.908 ms  0.746 ms /code/pre  code192.168.0.1/code is the address of my wireless router. I still can surf the internet though.  <answer175793> By some searching I found a strongsolution/strong to this problem.  First, change the emDNS address/em in your network configurations to a better one, like google's 8.8.8.8. Second, run codesudo hostname theMachineNameYouWant/code in terminal.  The strongreason/strong for this:  They say that when you are doing DNS lookup/reverse lookup, the DNS server can give your machine a host name, this function should be turned off for public DNS servers, but I don't know why the DNS server of my local ISP has it on.  Since my machine uses a router, so it has a IP like 192.168.0.x in LAN, I don't know why but when using emtraceroute/em, this IP will be sent to the DNS server for a reverse lookup, and since it is a reserved IP address, the DNS server returns a hostname as embogon/em, thus, changes my machine's hostname.  So what is bogon? Bogon means the type of IP addresses that should not appear in a traceroute, like a reserved IP address.  bogon on wikipedia.  <comment207410> how long do you have it running ? <comment207411> @Buscarì›ƒ I'm not sure. <comment207412> well I just did it, and after 3 min or so and 13 steps it stops, but it does not changes my computer ID <comment207418> @Dwayne bogon is your (bogus?) machine name and not your user name. <comment207419> @klanomath you are right, this part is machine name, and I have never changed my machine name. Also it is bogon, may be it means bog on? <comment207482> I'd recommend changing the DNS settings _on your router_ to use something other than your ISP's DNS servers. They are running some mis-configured DNS and who knows what that means they're doing with DNS. Bad ISP, bad.
