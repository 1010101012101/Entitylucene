Disabling "access to contacts" dialog box with terminal <body> I am trying to disable the following dialog box that pops up all the time when I open Mail.app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rPuX.png" alt="Annoying dialog box"  Is there a way to do so using strongterminal/strong?  Thanks!  <answer158601> Mail will ask you only one time, and if you deny it should stop asking.  You can use the  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail SuppressAddressHistory -bool true /code/pre  However if you need to deny the access already given following are the instructions for that.  According to OS X Man pages you can reset privacy for apps to use your address book.   I did not try it since I do not want to revoke my settings, but it is safe to say it works on 10.9 according to Apple.  DESCRIPTION  The codetccutil/code command manages the privacy database, which stores decisions the user has made about whether apps may access personal data.  One command is current supported:  codereset/code    Reset all decisions for the specified service, causing apps to prompt again the next time they               access the service.  EXAMPLES      To reset all decisions about whether apps may access the address book:  precode   tccutil reset AddressBook /code/pre
