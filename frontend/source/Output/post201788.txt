How to block certain IP/Mac Addresses from accessing my AirPort on my 2009 iMac? <body> I have a 2009  iMac running OS X 10.6.8. I would like to filter certain IP/MAC addresses from accessing my WiFi via "Internet Sharing". I have already set a password, but I would still like to filter specific IP/MAC addresses.  Is this possible on my iMac with 10.6.8 ?  <answer201908> Apparently it's possible to enable MAC filtering using the Internet Sharing feature in Snow Leopard.  Here is an extended description how to do it and at the same time overcome some flaws of the sharing implementation of SL.  Essentially you have to add an additional key/array in the /etc/bootpd.plist containing the MAC as string:  precode    ....     &lt;key&gt;allow&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;0:17:43:a3:2d:45&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     ... /code/pre  Probably the opposite: deny/MAC-address works as well.  Please check the whole article and implement the respective modifications.  <comment243293> Please add your network topology. Which interface is connected to the internet via router/directly and how is the client you want to ban connected to your Mac? <comment243337> I'm unsure what you mean by network topology. My iMac is connected to the internet directly via ethernet cable and sharing its connectivity using WiFi via the "Internet Sharing" option. <comment243338> That's already appropriate.
