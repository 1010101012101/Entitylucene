How can I track application bandwidth usage? <body> I would like to be able to summarize daily network bandwidth usage for running applications. Additional details, such as a sorted list of addresses by traffic usage, would be nice to have as well but not essential. For the most part I just want to know which apps are using the most bandwidth.  All of the solutions seem far too detailed or complicated. These include:  ol liTerminal applications like codenettop/code/li liCommercial applications like LittleSnitch/li /ol  The closest I've come is use codenettop/code and export its results to CSV. I'm hoping there is something much simpler.  <answer272726> h2Use Activity Monitor/h2  Just open Activity Monitor (codeApplications/code - codeUtilities/code - codeActivity Monitor/code) and navigate to the codeNetwork/code tab. You'll be able to see which apps are sending/receiving data and how much per app/process.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xMDtg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer272733> This is closest thing I can find. For $8 it's a no-brainer.  TripMode  There are some other options:  ol liActivity Monitor. Too granular and only calculates when it is open. Does have the advantage that individual Safari tabs appear separately and it is very easy to kill a process./li liPeak Hour. Doesn't appear to track specific apps, but it looks like it talks to the router. It might be good for broad network evaluation of traffic usage./li liBitMeter. Tracks aggregate bandwidth use. Includes a nice web UI but no per-app info. Open source. I used this to find which app was using up loads of bandwidth by turning the suspects on and off and watching per minute bandwidth use./li /ol  <comment342770> Let me know if my answer helps or not by leaving a comment below it; if it doesn't help just lmk and I'd be happy to help more! <comment342778> I'm familiar with Activity Monitor. TripMode is much simpler and will block apps as well.
