macOS Siera doesn't give me the proper storage breakdown? <body> I've just upgraded my late 2011 MacBook Pro to macOS Sierra 10.12.4. When I went to check the storage used on my hard drive in About This Mac  Storage, at first it showed me the proper free/used breakdown, but when I got more details, it got way off:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6q2mK.png" alt="storage macos sierra" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nHM3a.png" alt="storage macos sierra with details"  It seems to be reading my ~100 GB Photos library which is on an external drive, but it thinks it's on the internal SSD, and it throws everything off. (It works like it should when the external drive is not connected.) This problem was not present on El Capitan:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FEQdJ.png" alt="el capitan storage"  Is there any solution to get it reporting storage properly?
