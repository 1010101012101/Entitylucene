Cannot create hidden user in Yosemite <body> I am currently trying to make a hidden user on Yosemite.  I have tried to follow tutorials from this site, however when I run the command codesudo dscl . append /Groups/&lt;real_name&gt; GroupMembership &lt;user_name&gt;/code I get this error: code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist: No such file or directory/code.  I have also done the command codesudo dscl . create /Users/hiddenuser IsHidden 1/code as shown here: How to add hidden user, yet I get the same error.  How would I fix this? Is it as simple as running codesudo touch /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist/code or is it more complicated then that?
