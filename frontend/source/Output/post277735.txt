Can I use Karabiner-Element or any other apps/workarounds to swap colon and semicolon in Sierra? <body> Until OS X El Capitan, I used Karabiner to swap the colon with the semicolon.  However, at least until now, the Karabiner Element doesn't support a key swap where both of keys are based on the same root key (so for example, swap between delete and backslash works but swap between single-quote and double-quote doesn't).  Is there any other hacks in Karabiner-Element that enables this swapping, or any other apps or workarounds in macOS that enables you to swap a key that built on the same base key?  <answer277748> I just did a test and TextExpander will do exactly what you want. (Keyboard Maestro couldn't.)  <answer287391> Unfortunately, Karabiner-Elements don't support the key swapping functionality. It only lets you remap some keys to others, and it is all it does right now.  Hammerspoon lets you swap keys, or lets you remap some keys or key combinations to others. You write in Lua to define whatever remapping you want.  <answer287393> You can easily make a custom layout with Ukelele to do this.  <comment362897> I think you should include an example of the script for remapping a single key to give people a feel for the amount of learning and effort this involves.
