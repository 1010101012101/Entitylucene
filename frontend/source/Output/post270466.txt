Is there a command-line Bluetooth LE utility similar to Linux's bluez package? <body> I wrote a program for interacting with a specific Bluetooth LE device, and it works on Linux because it relies on codehcitool/code and codegatttool/code. I want to make it work on macOS, but I can't find a Bluetooth package that does the same thing. Does one exist?  Also, I know this question is almost the same as mine, but it has had no answers for a year.  Thanks in advance!
