Keynote Presentation locking <body> Is there a way to lock an iPad, playing a keynote presentation, in presentation mode so that you cannot access edit mode at all?  We have a presentation which plays during a tour and if one of our guides, while getting the presentation set up, gets into edit mode, they can press our Bluetooth remote and it will add slides.  We use guided access mode once we are in the presentation we want, but there are two different presentations on the ipad and they need the ability to switch back and forth, but never the ability to add or edit the slides which switching from one presentation to the next.  <answer294556> One possible solution:  Using strongcollaboration/strong, the owner can share the presentations as a view only type. This would require creating the presentations on a different device such as another iPad or Mac, then sharing with the owner of the iPad.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PJpMK.jpg" alt="collaboration settings"
