Mac Pro reboots after sleeping with new SSD <body> I have an old 2008 Mac Pro (MacPro3,1) which I recently upgraded with a new SSD from OWC (currently in Bay 4).  I transfered my OS to that drive, and ever since the computer reboots instead of waking up from sleep.  I can put it to sleep just fine, but every time it wakes (whether thorough input or timer), I get the startup chime and it goes through the (immensely faster!) boot process.  Needless to say, this is rather annoying. What can I try to fix (or at least diagnose) this problem?  I'm currently still running 10.9.5, and would prefer not to update, but I'm willing to do so if that's a likely fix.    <comment305758> Did you enable TRIM support? <comment305763> @Allan - No, the drive [claims](https://www.owcdigital.com/products/ssd/owc-ssd-electra6g-overview) to *specifically* not need it.
