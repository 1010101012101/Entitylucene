Place document styles on the right of the document in Microsoft Word for Mac <body> On my PC, I can place (or doc) the MS Word styles to the right of the document/screen. Is this possible on Word 2011 for OS-X?  <answer173691> Yes, there's a button for it next to the quick styles bar, see the following screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvyZL.png" width="300" /  (click for larger image)  The same can be found in codeView -&gt; Toolbox -&gt; Styles/code.  <comment204476> I figured it would be hiding in plain site. Thanks.
