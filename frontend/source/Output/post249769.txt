Reasons why a battery might be randomly dropping? <body> Cycle Count is near 700 macOS Sierra Condition Good  Like last night I went to bed and charged my mac a bit beforehand but when I woke up I had 0% and couldn't open my mac. After charging my mac to 30% I unplugged the charger and replugged it and my battery spiked to 65%  <comment309922> Did this happen before you installed the beta software? <comment309935> Yes it has been happening for a bit
