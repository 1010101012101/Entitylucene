How do I configure a Smart Playlist to show songs not in other Playlists? <body> I have a ton of songs that I classify in named playlists, and would like to have an easier way of knowing if a song has been previously classified or not. The thought occurred to me to make a Smart Playlist that will show me songs that meet the following requirements:  ul liMedia Type must be Music (excludes Music Videos, Movies, TV Shows, Books, Podcasts, etc.)/li liMust not exist in any playlist within the parent Classification folder./li liMust not exist in the "Unclassifiable" folder./li /ul  I can't get the Smart Playlist to populate with all remaining songs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PRJgJ.png" alt="Smart Playlist Rules for &#39;Unclassified&#39;"  Is it possible to create a Smart Playlist showing all songs not in another playlist?  <answer74222> It turns out that the screenshot, or at least the correct version, is sufficient:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rptTA.png" alt="Smart Playlist Settings"  No doubt in part to my tens of thousands of songs, and only a few hundreds currently classified, the playlist took sometime to populate. After reading Kyle's comment, I looked at the playlist and nearly my whole library is now present.  So the answer to this problem can only logically be:  Patience  <comment86102> It's supposed to be "Is Not" Genres, actually, but it's a moot point. Either way it's set, I get 0 results. I've also tried using "Media Kind is Music" and only specifying the playlists that should have music excluded from. <comment86130> That should work. Maybe you should double check your "Unclassifiable" playlist to make sure it doesn't contain all the songs in your library? <comment86148> 0 items in Unclassifiable (which is a static playlist, not a Smart Playlist) for the moment. 0 items in Unclassified. <comment86182> Hm, I created a similar Smart Playlist in my iTunes and it works fine http://cl.ly/LRnP <comment86233> I guess it just takes a long time to populate. Because sure enough I come back today and it's suddenly working. <comment86241> I'm glad it worked finally, but it shouldn't have taken that much time. I have ~7500 songs in my library and iTunes is able to make smart playlists instantly. <comment86242> [http://i.stack.imgur.com/s7Osc.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/s7Osc.png)
