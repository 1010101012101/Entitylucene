Iphone 5s: Can not find apple id <body> I was wondering whether there is a way to find the appleid of an iphone that is stuck in the activation screen, when connecting it to itunes on a computer that was connected in the past.  Thanks a lot for your help.  <answer193998> If you take it to the Apple Store or call AppleCare they'll be able to look this up for you, from your device's serial number.  <comment231316> possible duplicate of [How can I bypass Activation Lock?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114985/how-can-i-bypass-activation-lock)
