QuickTime Player crashes on startup <body> Suddenly I can't get QuickTime Player to work anymore because it crashes right after opening it. I do not know if this is the right error message from the log:  precodeApplication Specific Information: Sandbox creation failed: Container object initialization failed. NSCocoaErrorDomain:512 /code/pre  Does anyone know how to fix the problem or how to reinstall the application even if it's a system app?  <comment281950> What version of Quicktime Player? <comment281957> Assuming your home directory is in its default installation place (i.e. you haven't moved it, or net boot) and, judging by the word "Suddenly", this is not the first time you attempt to launch QuickTime Player X, have you tried removing the container? `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX` <comment282247> OK, removed it and the player works again. Thanks! :) <comment282248> Btw, should I delete my question now or what?
