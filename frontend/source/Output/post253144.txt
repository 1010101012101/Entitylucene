AppleScript: Tell Google Chrome to activate/deactivate extension <body> I want to have AppleScript activate/deactivate a plugin, using a keyboard command.  I have set the keyboard command in emGoogle Chrome  Settings  Extensions  Keyboard shortcuts/em and it works when I do it manually. For this example, I'm using kbdShift/kbd + kbdAlt/kbd + kbdU/kbd.  I've tried a few variants of this script.  precodetell application "Google Chrome" to activate tell application "Google Chrome" to key code u using {option down, shift down} delay(1) tell application "Google Chrome" to keystroke "r" using command down /code/pre  The last past refreshes the window, and it works â€“ but not the second line which is supposed to toggle the extension. Again, I can toggle the extension manually with kbdShift/kbd + kbdAlt/kbd + kbdU/kbd, but the script won't do it,  I also tried this:  precodetell application "Google Chrome" to keystroke "u" using {option down, shift down} /code/pre  Is the script actually supposed to work, making the problem reside somewhere else, or is there something wrong in it?  <answer253157> Try this code instead.  precodetell application "Google Chrome" to activate tell application "System Events" to keystroke "u" using {option down, shift down} delay(1) tell application "System Events" to keystroke "r" using command down /code/pre  I actually ran this applescript along with yours. First time I did not test yours seeing you called for a key code but gave it a keystroke value. When I ran your code, it gave me syntax errors(even with proper key code and keystroke values). When I ran my code, it compiles properly and runs the script as intended.   <comment315036> @Winterflags See update.
