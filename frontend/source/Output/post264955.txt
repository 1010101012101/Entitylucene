iPhone is not charging after updating to iOS 10.1 <body> I have an iPhone 6, just updated to iOS 10.1, and my iPhone is not charging.       Error message: This accessory may not be supported.    Tried to turn on and off airplane mode which works for about 30 minutes then error message again and my iPhone is not charging again.  Apple charging cable is in new condition.  Outlets are fine. Did all troubleshooting so far.  Reseted the phone as well.  No luck.  <comment332294> I contacted the Apple Store. I had to restore my phone to factory settings and do update through Itunes. I am waiting to see if it fixes the problem.,
