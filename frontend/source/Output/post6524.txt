Mac Apps Store wont download any apps on computer <body> I have successfully downloaded apps on a laptop, but when trying to download on a desktop mac, whenever i click install, it says 'put password for billing info', as it would normally. I do so, click enter, and nothing happens.  No error message, nothing.  <answer6604> Try signing out of your iTunes account then signing back in.  <comment6792> Are you an admin on that computer? <comment6813> have you tried signing out then signing back in with your iTunes account? <comment6886> thanks, singing out and in worked. It let me confirm my details then. I don't if i'm supposed to do anything to show that your answer is right (i'm new) <comment6896> I'll add my response as an answer then you can check the checkmark.  Thanks, glad it worked.
