Should I get a Macbook Air Haswell i5 8GB <body> Right now I have an older Macbook Pro with the following specs:  precode2.3 GHz i5 4 GB 1333 MHz Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB /code/pre  And have the possibility to trade my Macbook Pro for a 2013 Haswell Macbook Air with the following specs:  precode1,3-GHz i5 8 GB 1600 MHz Intel HD Graphics 5000 /code/pre  Right now there is no way I can play games on my Macbook Pro. It just can't handle it. Will this be at least a little bit better with the Haswell Processor of the Macbook Air?  <answer107812> Yes the Intel HD 5000 is better than a HD 3000 but it's still a integrated chip. So it won't be killer chip you are waiting for.   I suggest you to check some test who include benchmarks like on AnandTech. The question is what level of performance can satisfy your needs.   <comment126411> That depends. Do you want to? <comment126413> Both!  But, honestly, this question is a bit to subjective for StackExchange.  Please find a way to ask a more specific question.  I recommend asking "What type of macbook would best suit these needs?" And provide a list of specific needs that you need to fulfill in your line of work. <comment126414> You're right. I've edited my question. Hope this is more specific. <comment126432> Great edit. If you could narrow games, that would be even better. No one would say you couldn't play Minecraft or [Limbo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/limbo/id481629890?mt=12) on any Mavericks capable hardware, but perhaps GTA or some aggressive GPU hungry games might have frame rates below what some consider ideal. <comment126471> Thanks, that was the answer I was looking for! Im not expecting anything from it. Just wanted to know if it would perform better. Thank you!
