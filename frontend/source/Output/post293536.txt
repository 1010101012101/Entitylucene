Use OS X's native aliases to exclude folders from tarsnap backups? <body> Tarsnap can exclude folders from backups using the --exclude '/Users/someUser/someDirectory' flag.  I'm wondering if there's a way I could instead do something like:  --exclude '/Users/Harv/noBackup/', and then create native OS X folder aliases and drag them into noBackup.  I think this probably wouldn't work, and I'm sure it has something to do with OS X and how it does aliases (they're not UNIX hard or soft links, are they?).  So part 2 of my question is could I do the same thing but without using native OS X's aliases?  Perhaps by hard-linking or soft-linking the directories I want to be excluded inside noBackup?  <comment370469> Do you already have and use Tarsnap? If yes, then there shouldn't be a need to ask this question because you could simply test for yourself whether or not it would work. I don't have Tarsnap, but having read the [tarsnap(1) man page](https://www.tarsnap.com/man-tarsnap.1.html), the methods mentioned to exclude a pattern are, `--exclude pattern`, and `-X filename` where the latter states, "(c, x, and t modes only) Read a list of exclusion patterns from the specified file.". I would use the program options available, not have a special exclude directory with links of any type.
