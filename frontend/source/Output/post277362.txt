Why does 'Searching...' appear in the top left of my iPhone 5S when I have strong connectivity? <body> The word 'Searching...' appears in the top left corner of any window on my iPhone 5S while the power icon shows full strength, and I'm not prevented from any connectivity function, like texting, email, or Facebook. Why? What should be there? About an hour ago during a heavy downpour, I had exactly the same indications but was totally prevented from any connectivity even though it showed a strong, active WIFI connection. Can anyone explain what's going on, please?
