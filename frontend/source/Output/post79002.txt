Does anybody know an email client for iOS that is password protected? <body> I am looking for an email client, that when opened, asks for a password before showing email messages. Is there such an app available for iOS?  <answer79020> I haven't seen an app like that, but if you have a Gmail account you can use 1Password (App Store Link) to access the web interface. The 1Password app is locked by default. This would work with any email account with a webmail interface.  <answer79038> If you are using Exchange ActiveSync - check out NitroDesk Touchdown for iOS. I've a feeling that has a passcode screen on launch/switch.   <answer81297> What kind of server are you accessing? If you use Exchange, check out Mail+ for Outlook. They have an easy to set passcode option which prompts you for a pin each time the app is launched. If you do not successfully provide the passcode within 5 attempts, your credentials and all emails are erased.   If you are using ActiveSync (or have ActiveSync for Gmail), check out their other version. It uses similar technology.   <answer102727> "ibisMail" password protected.  <answer128353> Boxer does this. There is a free and a paid version.  Unfortunatley it is, in my experience, buggy, and it doesn't support text expander touch. I'm still on the lookout for the perfect mail app.  <answer271057> try iBis mail  ibisMail - Filtering Mail  <comment91340> Do you also need ut to log out when you leave your computer? and could you set the screen saver to need a password before unlocking? <comment91343> What screen saver? This is an iOS device. <comment91344> I don't mind down votes, if they are warranted. How would you improve or rewrite this answer? <comment91359> No idea. It's a good workaround, in my opinion. +1 <comment91365> Great question. I've been wondering the same thing. Hopefully Apple makes this option native soon. <comment91396> Just an idea that crossed my mind, please ignore if you've tried it. I wonder if encrypting the executable within the mail application would do the trick so that it can not be opened without inputing some passphrase. I thought of changing permissions, but maybe you need to change them back again after permission repairs. <comment120916> We need more information that explains why your answer meets the OP's requirements. Links or pictures would be appreciated. <comment120932> I like your idea so up voting you. The only thing I can think of why someone may have down voted you is a browser may not be considered a mail client <comment146250> Doesn't answer the question. Question asks for an email client, not an html browser. This is more of a work-around *IF* your provider happens to have a good mobile front end... <comment340709> Welcome to Ask Different â€“ we're looking for answers that are in-depth and insightful.
