How to remove partition on SD card using a Mac? <body> I got Raspbian on a SD card, and then accidentally wiped it. Now I have 2 visible partition. How do I get rid of the partition on a Mac.  <answer226137> Use Disk Utility to repartition the drive. It should be able to accomplish everything you need, including reformatting as well if you need it.  <answer269148> Use the Apple disk Utility.  First select the boot partition, click the erase button, give it the name you want it to have, and click erase. Now your SD card will have only one partition with the name you have given it.  <answer280650> Using Terminal:  codediskutil list/code  codediskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX/code (X is number of disk from step 1)  codesudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/diskX bs=1000000/code (X is number of disk from step 1)  Then wait!

It's a bit unclear what you're asking. <comment274388> Try Disk Utility? <comment274915> when i go on disk utility it does not give me a partition option <comment274916> i wiped both partitions and i actually have 3 but i can only see 2 and the other one is storage <comment274922> @paul I'm not sure what you're saying. Can you try rephrasing it? <comment274993> on my mac it is not letting me make changes. What do i do? <comment275021> @paul Okay, what is it doing that isn't letting you make changes? Are there error messages? Can you add screenshots? <comment353332> The edit made the answer less explanatory than my original text. This is no longer my post.
