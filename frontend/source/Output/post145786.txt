How to run a script on login whilst being hidden <body> I have an applescript (scpt) script that I would like to run on login of a user. I would like the script not be visible in the dock, menu bar, etc. (This would probably mean running it in the background or something.)  What would be the best way to do this?  Preferably, I would like it that it would not be easily noticeable that the script is being auto-run. Also, a way to somewhat easily remove the script from login would be helpful.  If needed, I'll attach a copy of the script. It's supposed to be a prank using the say command, any tips for improving the script would be nice ;)  <answer145789> Instead of launching strongTerminal/strong You can make something like:  precoderepeat     delay (random number from 1 to 5) -- Change the delay in seconds     do shell script "say Hello" end repeat /code/pre  You can save it as an app and then change its Info.plist file to hide it from Dock. Simply add this line inside codeHello.app/Contents/Info.plist/code:  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  To launch it on login You can add this app to Login Items.
