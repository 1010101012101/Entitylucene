Keeping an internal disk ejected from the system <body> Fairly technical question, not sure if a solution even exists. Some relevant information about my system; late 2013 iMac fusion drive 1TB macOS 10.12.2  I split my fusion drive into the SSD and HDD portion. I fresh installed Sierra onto the SSD portion. Now what I want to do is make the HDD portion completely 'disappear'. Some steps I took is format the entire drive as free space so it doesn't have a file system i.e. it doesn't/cannot mount itself.  I want to take it a step further and keep this internal disk ejected (a step above unmounted). I ran the terminal command 'diskutil ejectdisk x' which works perfectly. however, everytime my machine wakes itself from sleep or restarts, the internal disk 'injects' itself again. is there anyway I can keep the internal disk always ejected? something perhaps in recovery?  Thanks for your time.  <comment334306> Possible duplicate of [How to prevent automount of a partition in El Capitan](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231756/how-to-prevent-automount-of-a-partition-in-el-capitan) <comment334307> I expect the above Q&A will help you! To find the drive's UUID, select the drive in Disk Utility, get info, and find the "File System UUID" row in the window that appears. <comment334311> no see that is dealing with keeping *volumes unmounted* and I am well aware of editing the fstab via vifs, getting UUID and putting those commands. my inquiry deals with keeping a *disk ejected*, which is a step above that. <comment334312> Ah, okay. Sorry for my confusion; I've retracted my duplicate vote. <comment334313> also in regards to finding UUID, you can no longer find UUID via disk utility, atleast the one of interest which is 'volume UUID', not file system.
