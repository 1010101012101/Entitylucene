When I use iMessages, is a copy of all messages retained in iCloud? <body> When I use iMessages, is a copy of all messages retained in iCloud (on Apple's servers)? If yes, how can I delete them?  <answer189799> iCloud does store copies of your iMessages with the backup of the iDevices. To delete them, you'd have to delete every iCloud-Backup that contains the message.  As to my knowledge, there is no user-accessible copy of the iMessage stored apart from the backups.  <comment225219> Since I don't have a source to quote i will make this a comment, but only undelivered iMessages are stored by iMessage servers.  Any other implementation and apple would go bankrupt complying with subpoenas.
