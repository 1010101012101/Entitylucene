Changing the open with settings in 10.10.1 <body> I am looking for a way to edit the open with settings in 10.10.1, i have looked through older questions and have attempted to rename the launch services plist and have gotten no where.   I have looked through the   code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister/code   and my    code/Users/J/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist/code   and I was able to remove text edit from random extensions but i am still unable to remove numbers or find its assoisation to .py files in a   code/lsregister -dump/code  Here is a picture to clarify, i would like to remove numbers.app and pages.app along with xcode.app as options to open up files with a .py extension.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x404n.png" alt="enter image description here"  Sidenote: Another related feature is i would like to add an application in that menu for every single file type in my system. For example i would like to be able to open every file in my system with hexfiend and textedit.  right clicking/adding every time i have a new file type is a pain because my applications folder is filled with a few apps that are folders that get searched recursively when i look through it  Update: solution directly from apple -- Uninstall numbers. Other then uninstalling the application, it is not possible to remove applications from this list published by apple... any other publisher and it is possible lol.......  <comment190617> Please don't cross-post to multiple SE sites.

RCDefault does look useful but it seems a bit buggy and i can not find where it associated numbers to .py <comment190624> No worries, just thought I'd mention it;) Me neither - numbers doesn't show that it ought to be associated with .py, but it is on my machine too. <comment190625> @Tetsujin yeah it is starting to get annoying with so many other file types having 100% useless associations. a different thing that would be slightly helpful would be to say add one application to that list for every single file type on the system, updated question with a sidenote/ explination <comment190646> confirmed resetting LaunchServices doesn't clear it - it didn't annoy me before you mentioned it, but now it does ;-) I did find this to add an "Open With [specific app]" to Services - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151201/fetching-behavior-in-finder-open-with-menu-in-yosemite <comment190649> I also found this - but it doesn't work for Pages & Numbers, might be good for others, though - http://mac-how-to.wonderhowto.com/how-to/remove-duplicates-customize-open-with-menu-mac-os-x-0157100/ <comment190687> @Tetsujin nice link at wonderhow, it does look like it was written on 10.9 though so maybe its outdated which is why it still will not work for numbers? <comment190688> I'm still on 10.9 & it doesn't work here either, it's just not in the plistâ€¦ maybe .py is 'just text' as far as they are concerned, which of course, they are perfectly capable of opening? <comment190694> @Tetsujin maybe but doesn't .py have a different associated uti then .txt? at least its different in the /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -dump .   and err now i kinda want to remove numbers from .txt to lol, i mean this just seems like something that should be customizable <comment190696> Association & generic capability don't seem to be separated at OS level
