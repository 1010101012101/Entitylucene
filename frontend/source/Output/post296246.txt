Scripting the sniffer built into Wireless Diagnostics <body> I'm interested in using the built-in wireless sniffer (accessible from Wireless Diagnostics by pressing Cmd-Opt-6) as a part of a script. Is there a way to control it via scripting, maybe AppleScript?  I need to:  ul listart the sniffer/li lichange the channel and bandwidth settings/li lioutput to a file (as usual)/li /ul  Can the UI be scripted with input events? Does Wireless Diagnostics offer any Apple events?
