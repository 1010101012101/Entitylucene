Is it possible to type in macron (e.g. "ā") without using U.S. Extended Keyboard? <body> I want to type in macron (e.g. kbdā/kbd) in my OS X, but after I searched for how to type in it, I got that I first must use U.S. Extended Keyboard as suggested in this article.  However, once I switch to U.S. Extended Keyboard, I cannot type in kbdå/kbd any more with kbd⇧+a/kbd and kbda/kbd, because on U.S. Extended Keyboard, it provides you with the aforementioned macron letter.   So is it possible to type in macron with normal English keyboard on OS X?   <answer200065> This is just a option without changing the default Keyboard.  In strongOS X/strong, this can be accomplished by strongholding down/strong the kbdA/kbd briefly and a pop-up will appear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MdWqN.png" alt="Select diacritic"  Just select by clicking or typing the corresponding number.  In this case kbd8/kbd  strongā ← Like that/strong  The repeat delay can be set to prevent eeeeeeeeee from happening too quickly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zK4Op.png" alt="Keyboard settings"  <answer200129> Keep US Extended and use it to type your kbdå/kbd. It's kbdalt/kbd + kbdk/kbd and then kbda/kbd.  <comment241042> Are you currently using Yosemite, or which OS? <comment241043> @bjbk Yosemite, but I'm able to switch to El Capitan immediately if it's possible there. <comment241048> If I hold down `a` it returns `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...` because I set `defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`, but I don't like to get back. Thanks for your answer though. <comment241093> Possibility "Alt+Maj+," to create "¯", and add in Shortcut "¯a" to create the "ā" (and so on for each letter). Possibly, any shortcut could be fine, but this one seems legit since it create a kind of macron. <comment241250> Oh, that is awesome. Thanks for the great tips. <comment241337> I apologize.  I was thinking of others who may have had similar problems typing other diacritics that stumble across this question.  Your answer was the correct and accepted answer. It was perfect, I was merely elaborating.  I'll remove it. <comment241371> Your answer is in fact the correct answer for most users.  It just so happens this poster has purposefully disabled the Character Picker, which is not normal.  His question ideally should have said that... <comment241373> I agree.  That fact didn't come to light until mentioned in comments. :/ <comment241429> @TomGewecke I can agree. This kind of default settings is usually executed only once and thus I noticed I'm away from the default only after getting this answer and trying on my system. Sorry... <comment309150> The OP wanted to know if there's a way to *avoid* using the U.S. Extended keyboard.
