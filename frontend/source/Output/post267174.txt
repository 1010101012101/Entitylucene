Vulnerability and patch management on macOS - what works? <body> I am trying to design a plan for patching Mac endpoints at my company. Are there any readily available tools which I could leverage for continuous security patch/update management for 3rd party apps on Mac. AppFresh seems to be discontinued. I looked into the Sparkle framework. Has anyone used it within an organization, and if yes, what is the best way to use it?  Any thoughts or guidance on operationalizing patch management on macOS in a startup would be highly useful.
