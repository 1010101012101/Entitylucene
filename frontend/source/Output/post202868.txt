Connect 3 monitors to Macbook Pro retina early 2015 13" <body> I've seen multiple system setups where people connected 3 external displays to their macbook pro retina 13". So I bought 2 Mini-Displayport to VGA and 1 HDMI to VGA adapters. The adapters are working fine, full HD resolutions works great but I cann only connect 2 external monitors. I can use 2 monitors via Mini-DP or 1 with HDMI and 1 with Mini-DP but when I connect all 3 one monitor will keep the black screen.   I read somewhere that I should use active Mini-DP to VGA adapters to use all 3 external screens.br Do you have some experience with this or have another solution?  <answer202869> According to Everymac     This model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 3840x2160 on two external displays via Thunderbolt 2. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 3840x2160 via Thunderbolt 2 and a single 1080p display at up to 60 Hz, 3840x2160 at 30 Hz, or 4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI.      Also see: How many external displays can the Retina Display MacBook Pro models support? What is the maximum supported resolution of each? Are adapters required?   <comment244681> Well its 3 full HD 1080p displays and since they're also connected to my other pc via HDMI I want to connect them to the mac using the vga interface.. <comment281677> Where did you see it?
