How do I send mass text on an iPhone? <body> I have an iPhone 4s and want to send a mass text. How do I send a mass text to 30 people without sending to everyone else in my Contacts?   <answer212158> You can send messages to a Contact Group - start to type the Group's name, then select when you see it in the list...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W85LB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment256188> or, just like in mail, keep typing names and adding them to the message. Tho not sure if Messages supports that many recipients, I guess you will find out.
