Where can I find the installed package path via brew <body> I installed some packages via brew. But I can not find where they are.  I can strongnot/strong get access by typing codehping/code on terminal  precode% brew install hping (git)-[master]  Warning: hping-3.20051105 already installed /code/pre  <answer145465> Normally, codehomebrew/code installs packages into code/usr/local/bin/code. So you need to check that your PATH contains that directory, like this:  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  Also, try running  precodebrew doctor /code/pre  to make sure your setup is correct. If code/usr/local/bin/code is not in your PATH, you need to edit code~/.profile/code and add a line like this:  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /code/pre  Then start a new Terminal (in order to re-read your login profile) and try again.  If all that fails, it must be installed somewhere else. You can search for it by running a command like this:  precodesudo find / -name hping -type f /code/pre  <answer145471> /usr/local/Cellar is the default location on OS X. You'll see subdirectories in there for all your installed formulae...  <answer145481> Use the following to show the installation path of a package:  precodebrew info hping /code/pre  Example output:  precodepcre: stable 8.35 (bottled) http://www.pcre.org/ /usr/local/Cellar/pcre/8.35 (146 files, 5.8M) *   Poured from bottle From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/pcre.rb ==&gt; Options --universal     Build a universal binary /code/pre  <answer202103> I recommend adding the following line to your code~/.bash_profile/code (or the equivalent configuration file if you are using a different shell):  precodeexport HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=/Applications" /code/pre  <answer203273> hping requires root privileges to run.  You probably need to add /usr/local/sbin to your PATH.  When I ran brew doctor:  precodeWarning: Homebrew's sbin was not found in your PATH but you have installed formulae that put executables in /usr/local/sbin. Consider setting the PATH for example like so     echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  <answer226936> To figure out where your formula is installed, just type do codebrew --prefix hping/code  You can also relink your codehping/code binary by doing codebrew unlink hping &amp;&amp; brew link hping/code  Also maybe your code$PATH/code is not well defined. Does the list given by codeecho $PATH/code contains the result given by codeecho $(brew --prefix)'/bin:'$(brew --prefix)'/sbin'/code? This path should be toward the beginning of the list, definitively before code/usr/bin/code. To do so, define it in your file code~/.zshrc/code or code~/.bashrc/code  E.g. of code$PATH/code: code/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code  <answer281301>    I installed some packages via brew. But I can not find where they are.   It seems that homebrew requires one to be explicit with things.  Fortunately, a bit of escaping using strongcodebrew --prefix/code/strong can make this a no-brainer, for those who need to find the path for the pkg-config utility, e.g.  precodePKG_CONFIG_PATH=`brew --prefix hping`/lib/pkgconfig/ pkg-config --cflags hping /code/pre  (Except this isn't going to work anyway, because it seems hping doesn't come with hping.pc .. although, in the case where package maintainers do put .pc files, this trick can be useful.)  <answer294904> Try this command  precodebrew --cellar &lt;FORMULA&gt; /code/pre  e.g.  precodebrew --cellar hping /code/pre  <comment171430> My hping is installed in `/usr/local/Cellar/hping/3.20051105/sbin/hping` <comment242042> These are symlinks. The actual packages are in `/usr/local/Cellar` as @PapaStanley points out. <comment313520> Is it possible to get only path? In my case I want to use clang from llvm and after "brew install llvm" clang is still apple's, but one from llvm binaries is what I need. <comment345515> I had the same problem with `daemonize`, [this answer](http://superuser.com/questions/324616/how-should-i-set-the-path-variable-on-my-mac-so-the-hombrew-installed-tools-are) helped me understand that daemonize is installed in `/usr/local/sbin` that was not in the PATH <comment345516> BTW `brew doctor` might help you understand issues as well.
