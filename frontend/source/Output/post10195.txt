How do I revive the Magic Mouse after replacing batteries? <body> When I replace the batteries in my Magic Mouse, I turn the mouse off, replace batteries and turn the mouse back on. The problem is that the system does not notice the mouse after this procedure, the mouse cursor stays stuck. I have to put the computer to sleep and wake it again to make the mouse work. Is there a better way to “wake” the mouse, maybe using some keyboard shortcut or a special click combination?  <answer10196> I find that double-clicking on both sides of the mouse simultaneously usually causes it to re-pair.  <answer10306> A simple click should do it. I find that it takes a second sometimes to reconnect so I usually click and move the mouse side to side until I see the mouse cursor move.  Here is the official document from Apple:     If you turn your mouse or trackpad off   or turn off the Bluetooth option in   your computer, the connection between   the computer and the mouse or trackpad   will be lost. When you turn on the   mouse or trackpad and Bluetooth, you   can re-establish this connection by   simply clicking the mouse button or   trackpad surface.   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3081  <answer212946> I replaced my batteries, and could not get the mouse to restart.  I was befuddled for a while, but then after looking closely at the battery compartment, I realized that the 2 batteries go in the SAME direction, not opposite directions as in most electronics.  Problem solved! LOL!  <comment10672> For me, usually just a normal click of any kind is enough to get it to reconnect. <comment10773> Somehow this did not work for me at least once or twice. Will try again next time, thanks! <comment357071> In the question he said that putting the computer to sleep and waking it resolved the problem. If he put the batteries in wrong, that wouldn't have worked, so this is not his problem.
