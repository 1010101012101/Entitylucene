Use iPhone or iPod touch as an external hard drive <body> I have an iPod touch 4g with 64GB storage space. Is there some way to store files of any file type on the device? I know that there are plenty of apps which let you share files via iTunes. Is there a way to make file storage independent from iTunes? Can I exchange data between a PC and a Mac that way? I have read that you have to use Jailbreak to access the file system. Is there any other more "legitimate" way of doing this?  <answer286847> I found this after a quick search: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/air-share-transfer-files-from-pc-to-iphone-ipad/id1126257410?mt=8  YMMV  <answer286860> If you have any apps or music on there, there's probably less than fifty GB available.  If you are that low on space, you might be better off with  a 64GB USB drive or SD card.  DropBox, OneDrive, iCloud, and their several competitors make it easy to keep files on it, but they also keep a copy of the same files on your other device.
