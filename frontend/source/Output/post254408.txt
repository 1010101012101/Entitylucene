Cannot open page in Safari iOS 10.0.2 <body> I can't download anything from a website on iOS 10.0.2 because it says that "Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Does anyone know how to fix it?!  <comment316729> Can you clarify your question. Are you saying it's stuck on the _Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid_ pop-up window? Or are you saying it just can't load a particular website? Or is it that it loads the website but you're trying to download something and then you get the error? <comment316741> I'm trying to download something on safari but then I get the error!
