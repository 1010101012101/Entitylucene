Connecting headset to iPhone's iPod player <body> I have a Plantronics ML10 headset and after setting it up through bluetooth it can handle calls. But when I play music with my IPhone, the sound is not coming through the earpiece.   Is there anyway I could "channel" the sound to the earpiece whenever I play songs with the iPhone?  <answer26578> Sorry, but I don't think it will work. To send music over Bluetooth, the device needs to support the emA2DP/em Bluetooth profile. Your headset (and most others not specifically intended for music) only supports the basic handsfree profile, so the iPhone can't send it music from the iPod app.  <comment30328> I see thanks for the help
