How can I speed up the way OS X takes a window into full screen <body> I click the green circle at the top left of my screen so my window can go into full-screen mode.  Then I have to wait while my Mac performs some unnecessary animation to show me that I'm going into full-screen mode.  Can I eliminate that animation and go into full-screen instantly?  <answer176846> Take a sip of your tea - it's finished ;)   afaik, you can't bypass it.   My guess is it's to mask the amount of 'effort' it takes to do the transition, smooth zoom rather than lumpy pseudo-instant transition with bits of broken screen til it's finished.  <comment209204> The slowness is such a momentum killer, but I think you're right. There's no way to bypass it. Thanks for explaining why.
