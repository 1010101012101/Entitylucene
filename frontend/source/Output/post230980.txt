Does Fantastical support viewing free/busy information from Google Calendar? <body> Or said another way, can I see availability of invitees (and resources would be even better) when creating a new event in Fantastical. I don't see it in the interface anywhere and it is critical for me in scheduling meetings with coworkers.  Mac OS 10.10.5, Fantastical 2.1.5.  <answer231015> Fantastical mention free/busy information (aka availability) in the FAQ for the Mac version.     Fantastical 2 does not currently support replying to Exchange   invitations, marking Exchange events as private, or viewing the   availability of other Exchange users.   They also answered this question about their iPad version through their Flexibits Twitter account back in April 2014.     Sorry, Fantastical 2 for iPad won’t let you view free/busy time for   meeting invitees.   Note they are talking about Exchange, but given it is arguably the most popular source of free/busy information its not a huge leap to assume the same for Google Calendar.  strongUPDATE 30 March 2016/strong Flexibits just released a new version of Fantastical for Mac (version 2.2) that includes support for viewing free/busy information. As above, they focus on Exchange support, but Google Calendar is mentioned too.     ... new in version 2.2 is our spiffy invitee availability view. When   using a compatible service — such as Google or Exchange — you’ll be   able to see your invitees’ availability and let Fantastical instantly   schedule a meeting for when you’re all free, saving you the time of   coordinating with multiple people. (iCloud does not support   availability.)   <comment282007> In any case, Fantastical does not seem to allow viewing of free/busy information according to their FAQ. "[Fantastical 2 does not currently support ... viewing the availability of other Exchange users.](https://flexibits.com/fantastical/faq)" Note they are talking about Exchange, but given it is arguably the most popular source of free/busy information.

Unclear indeed. <comment282060> Thanks for the edits. Pinging @AlistairMcMillan for a proper answer now that it's clear which product is in play.
