Transfer video from iPhone to Mac without cable? <body> I'm at my job and I have no cable, so connecting my iPhone with my computer is not possible.

Press and hold on the icon for the video you wish to move to your computer and select copy from the pop-up menu that appears.  Still on your iPhone open Mail and create a new message. In the body of the message, press and hold the cursor, and select paste from the pop-up menu.
