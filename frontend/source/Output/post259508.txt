How to unlock my mac remotely? <body> So i want to know how to remotely unlock my mac via ssh so i don't have to put my password in front of people or having to make them look the other direction while i type my password. I have tried using the command on a post that is 7 months old but i get an error: "syntax error: Expected end of line but found class name. (-2741)". Any help will be appreciated, thank you in advance!  <answer259510> Set the time to require a password after sleep/screensaver in System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General to "immediately".
