Where does Transmit 4 store temporary downloaded files? <body> If you have two remote locations in Transmit 4, say an S3 and an FTP location, and you move a file between these two locations, Transmit will automatically download that file, and then upload it.  Where does Transmit 4 store these temporary files?  <answer55140> You can find this out by yourself:  ol liStart Transmit/li liExecute codesudo opensnoop -n Transmit/code in Terminal/li liInitiate transfer from S3 to FTP/li /ol  This will list all created/opened files, it shouldn't be difficult to identify the temporary files.  <answer142917> The opensnoop program is remarkably useful, but to answer the actual question in case somebody is in a quick bind, for Transmit 4 the location of the temporary files is:  precode/Volumes/&lt;Macintosh HD&gt;/Users/&lt;current user&gt;/Library/Caches/Cleanup At Startup/Transmit/server-to-server-B18AC7A9-81C6-4AAD-8F2C-6CD70E65D7FD/data-file-being-transferred /code/pre  Transmit appears to clean up after itself within a second or two of the upload completing. The name and path of the folder implies to me that the system might clean it up if Transmit doesn't get the chance.  <comment63281> dude, you're a genius.
