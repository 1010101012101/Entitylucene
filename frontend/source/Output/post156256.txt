Mountain Lion -- Finder always freezing <body> I'm on 10.8.2.  Finder always freezes.  I have way more CPU and memory than this OS needs.  It's only Finder.  CPU usage spikes, spinning beachball, the whole thing.  I cleared all my caches, disabled the "all my files" finder window.  What else can I do?  Does this get fixed in 10.8.3,4, or 5?  <answer157762> Uninstalling Google Drive and restarting the Finder has solved this issue.  <comment183758> anything of interest in console logs ? <comment185509> Getting ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Drive/GoogleDriveIpcPipe is a symbolic link ... cannot connect socket to server. <comment185514> What about the Google drive? do you use the web version or have it installed on your Mac. <comment185609> I have it installed.  I suppose I ought to uninstall it? <comment185610> Yes, I removed it and only use the web version. <comment185611> Whew, what a relief.  Now I get to enjoy my system resources again! <comment185612> nice, glad it worked for you. here are some + points as reward :)
