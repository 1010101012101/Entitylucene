How to stop fullscreen from hogging focus? <body> In Chrome (I haven't tested it on any other applications), if I set a video to play in fullscreen mode and I want to see any other window within the same application, sometimes (not always) the fullscreen window will immediately switch focus to it. So I have to enter/exit Full screen mode whenever I want to check other windows. Why does this happen and is there a way to prevent the windows from hogging the focus?  I'm also curious as to why this happens just sometimes.  I have OSX 10.11.6  <comment372151> Duplicate of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/255962/videos-played-in-fullscreen-on-google-chrome-forces-window-to-be-viewed and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/262646/chrome-on-macos-sierra-automatically-jumps-to-desktop-with-fullscreen-video and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/263644/osx-chrome-keeps-jumping-back-to-video-when-in-fullscreen
