Claris/Appleworks 9.2 database Convert to 10.4? <body> I use Clarisworks (Appleworks) 9.2 for a database on my dual MAC 9.2/10.4. Problem is the instability of the database. I have occasionally lost many of the entries (total 3800) and have to re-enter.  Is there a converter to PC Word/Oracle? Can a word processor in 10.4 be used to import the database?  <comment191615> You need to improve your question: which version of AppleWorks are you using on Mac OS 9.2? What database type applications are you using on 10.4? What solution would you prefer? What budget?
