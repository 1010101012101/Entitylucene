Mail.app smart mailbox, how to negate a search filter clause (_not_ flagged)? <body> How can I negate the search criterion: "is flagged"?  I need all messages in a given mailbox, whose flag is emnot/em set (i.e. they are emnot/em flagged).  <answer72158> I would create a smart mailbox containing all Flagged items, and then (this is the one you want) a smart mailbox with the 'Not In Mailbox' option to return all the items that are not Flagged, and thus not in that mailbox.    Create this first: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Ky9t.png" alt="Mailbox showing all flagged items"  Then for the mailbox you want, create this one: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wzjzW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Worked for me in Mail 4.6, OSX 10.6.8.  <comment83843> But this would not validate _both_ conditions though, would it? **IN** Mailbox X **AND** _not_ flagged.. <comment83857> Yes, because 'not flagged' is the same as 'not in the Smart Mailbox that includes all the flagged messages'. <comment84204> Actually, yours is an awesome solution and it works! Thanks!
