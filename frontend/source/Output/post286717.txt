Open farthest right tab in Safari <body> In Chrome, one can press codecmd+1/code to open the first tab, codecmd+3/code to open the third tab, etc...  Safari has replicated this behavior now but has not replicated codecmd+9/code which takes the user to the far right tab even if there are dozens of tabs in the window.  Is there a way to map codecmd+9/code or another key mapping to that action?  <answer286736> That was a fun question to tackle! Follow the instructions below and paste this code in step 1.8:  precodeset n to 0  tell application "Safari"     repeat with w in windows         try             set n to n + (count tabs of w)         end try     end repeat end tell    tell front window of application "Safari"     set current tab to tab n end tell /code/pre  This will tell Safari to change to the right most tab. Then, to map it to a key shortcut, just follow the steps listed here by codeMonomeeth/code which is shown below.
