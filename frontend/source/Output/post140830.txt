iPhone Field Test mode permanently in iOS 7 <body> I have seen 2 different methods of putting your iPhone in Field Test mode permanently in iOS 7, a short one and a long one.   The short way:  ol liOpen your phone app and dial code*3001#12345#*/code (I recommend putting this in your Notepad so can copy and paste it. You will need it several times.)/li liPress and hold the power button until the slide to close appears. /li liHold the home to kill the Field Test mode app (In iOS 7 it will restart, in iOS 6 it is now permanent.)/li liRepeat step 2 and 3 a couple of times. /li liTap the home button to close Field Test mode./li liRepeat steps 1â€“3 (With a little bit of luck it will work the first time here. I am usually able to get it the first time here. If not keep repeating.)/li liWhen it works you will see the Field Test mode actually close and NOT restart. When this happens it is now permanent. /li /ol  The long way:  ol liOpen your phone app and dial code*3001#12345#*/code./li liPress and hold the power button until the slide to close appears./li liSlide the slide bar to turn your phone off. /li liTurn your phone back on./li liIt should now be permanent. /li /ol  Sources:  ul lihttp://forums.imore.com/guides-how-articles/271233-guide-signal-strength-changing-dots-decibels.html/li lihttp://forums.imore.com/iphone-5s/263849-numbers-instead-signal-dots.html#post2092268/li /ul  Has anyone found any other ways to put your phone in Field Test mode permanently with iOS 7?  <answer140831> I'm not exactly sure as I haven't tried this on iOS 7, but according to one of the users in this post, your second way should make it permanent on iOS 7:     " Step 4: Press down on the Home button until the app closes and you   return to your home screen. (NOTE: User bladepwns reports that on iOS   7, this does not return you to the home screen. He reports that   powering OFF your phone while in FIELD TEST mode will accomplish the   same thing.) "    If it doesn't work, perhaps it's a phone difference? Or maybe you need to try it a few more times before it stays.  <answer159709> For iphone6 and ios8.1.1 once I was in field test mode I had to hold down power and home buttons - hard reset the phone to get the #'s to stay - all other methods the bars/dots came back  <answer192156> For keeping it in iOS 7:  ol liOpen field test/li liHold the power button until the slider appears/li liLet go of the power button then hold the home button/li liYou should be returned to the home screen as you have just force quit the app/li /ol  <comment180180> What do you mean by permanent? <comment181761> @user97711, I mean that it continues to display the signal as a number when you quit the Field Test mode, instead of reverting to back to the default circles for indicating signal strength.
