How do I resume the iTunes queue from when I last quit? <body> iTunes 11 appears to be saving my queue from when I last quit it with kbd⌘/kbd-kbdQ/kbd—all unplayed songs remain in the queue, listed under "Up Next".  However, I cannot determine a way to resume this queue.  Steps to reproduce:  ol liStart iTunes and verify your queue is empty and you are on the Albums view./li liDouble-click an album to add it./li liPress kbd⌘/kbd-kbdQ/kbd to exit./li liRestart iTunes./li /ol  If I press Play at this point, the queue appears to fill with my entire library and start with the first album shown.  How can I resume my queue?  <answer95748> A queue left-over from an iTunes exit, as above, can be resumed thus:  ol liClick the queue icon./li liDouble-click the first song in the queue./li /ol  img src="https://i.imgur.com/CPjLGdv.png" alt=""  <answer95749> This seems to work for me emand is much quicker if you're like me and prefer keyboard shortcuts/em:  Open iTunes and…  ol liPress kbd►►/kbd (F9)./li liPress kbd►II/kbd (F8)./li /ol  <comment112372> This is an interesting approach.  A variation: if I instead hit rewind before play, I can restart the song that was playing when I quit iTunes. <comment186169> This also works when the queue icon is inaccessible (for example if an iPhone is syncing)
