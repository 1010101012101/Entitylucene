How can I make autocomplete in the shell work with case-folding? <body> How can I make the autocompletion for files and folders in the bash shell work case-insensitively?  Ideally, codecd ~/doc/code + kbdtab/kbd autocompletes to codecd ~/Documents/code (correcting the case as it autocompletes), but if that's not possible autocompleting to codecd ~/documents/code is acceptable too.  <answer68501> You can do that by typing the following command in the terminal:  precodeecho 'set completion-ignore-case On' &gt;&gt; ~/.inputrc /code/pre  if you want to go back to the original behavior you have the open that file and remove the line.  The file code~/.inputrc/code file deals with mapping the keyboard for specific situations. This file is the start-up file used by Readline, the input-related library used by Bash, perl and most other open source programs.      The configuration options in .inputrc are particularly useful for   customising the way Tab-completion works, e.g. with the ls command      When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the init   file is read, and the key bindings are set.   You can find more information about the file syntax in "Bash startup files".  <comment79539> Ty, this works. Out if curiosity, is there a reason why this doesn't work when added to ~/.bash_profile for example? <comment79544> @Gerry I noticed the same by adding it to `.profile` (correct it if I'm wrong). In my opinion this is because Readline read the `.inputrc` or `/etc/inputrc` and not other files. However I'm not completely sure about that.
