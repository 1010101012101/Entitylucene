What's Photoshop CS6 keyboard shortcut to call Edit - Transform - Scale? <body> I'm not able to see any predefined keyboard shortcut to call Scale under Transform.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sx2Q8.png" alt="enter image description here"  If such a shortcut does not exist, is there any possibility to define one, so a specific thing will be called?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZtUFJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer244811> Why can't you use the shortcut for codeFree transform/code?   Either way...  You can edit / add keyboard shortcuts in Photoshop in:  codeEdit &gt; Keyboard shortcuts.../code   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8LXP3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment301869> That's exactly what I needed. Thank you.
