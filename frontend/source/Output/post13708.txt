Disabling the "keep pressed" function of OS X sticky keys <body> I use the accessibility feature called sticky keys in OS X, what it does is that if you press a command modifier key (Ctrl, Cmd, Alt, Shift, Fn), it stays "pressed" until you press another key. This is very useful if you often use your keyboard with one hand, and actually quite convenient even when you use two hands.  The thing is that if you press a modifier key strongtwice/strong it stays "pressed" until you press it again. While it is sometimes handy, for me it would be strongpreferable if this aspect of the functionality could be disabled/strong, since I trigger it accidentally every now and then.  I realize that if this is at all possible it probably means fiddling with some system file somewhere, that's fine. I just want to see if someone out there might know where to look? :)  <answer15954> I believe you have to press it 3 times to release it.  ul liFirst Press - Locks the modifier key, and unlocks it after the next key press/li liSecond Press - Locks the modifier key for multiple other key presses./li liThird Press - Unlocks the modifier./li /ul  Exmaple:  Pressing Shift twice while sticky keys is on would be the same result as turning on CAPS lock.  <answer42022> You can't turn off the "key lock" functionality (last checked on OS X 10.8.2). You can however install KeyRemap4MacBook, which allows you to make modifier keys sticky without this "key lock".  <answer80531> go in to system pref, accessibility, keybord (left column) sticky keys, options, then "press shift five times to toggle sticky keys"  <answer272409> I've seen this behavior even when "sticky keys" is turned off in system settings, by unchecking the "enable sticky keys" checkbox.  I was seeing shift stuck "on" only for OS actions (not for normal typing) after coming back from a lock screen.    To resolve this, I turned sticky keys on (Mac Settings) and then toggled them off again using the shortcuts above.   <comment17403> Sorry, but I'm asking for a way to disable the "locked" state altogether. I think it's pretty clear from the wording of my question. :) <comment17458> Ah yes, sorry I misunderstood. I don't know of a way to do that. <comment61544> Thanks for the tip, I'll see if it's usable for me though.  It's such a pity that there's no option for this, because sticky keys is such a convenient feature! <comment92919> This disables the functionality altogether, the asker only wants to disable the "lock" part you get by pressing a modifier twice (but still use the single press functionality). <comment92981> my apologies, i misunderstood the question then <comment94034> Ended up not using KeyRemap4MacBook, didn't feel comfortable with it. <comment98467> just fyi, i [added this setting](https://github.com/tekezo/KeyRemap4MacBook/pull/118) to KeyRemap4MacBook yesterday. it's available in version 8.0.33; it's called 'Enable Sticky Modifier Keys (without lock feature)'.  @Devon, i've been using it with lots of combined shortcuts like you mention, and it's pretty reliable. <comment98516> @ryan, The problem with KeyRemap still exists, but I've created a proper bug report for it now. <comment107055> The KeyRemap4MacBook bug has [fixed](https://github.com/tekezo/KeyRemap4MacBook/issues/119) as of version 8.0.34. <comment371498> I had the same problem! It was impossible to google, produced some strange behavior before I figured out it was as if I were holding Shift down. Yes, if your password includes capital letters, then Shift might get forced "on" after the lock screen. Just discovered that toggling sticky keys off and on solves the problem.
