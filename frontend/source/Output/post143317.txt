Change source in Audio MIDI Setup via command line? <body> Is there a way to change the AirPlay source in strongAudio MIDI Setup/strong via the command line (currently I'm doing this with GUI scripting)? My idea is to change the source with the strongdefaults/strong command in the application's .plist-file, but I've not been able to find the correct file/value.  I've found and looked in the following files, but nothing there reflects the AirPlay source:  strongem/Users/Name/Library/Preferences/com.apple.audio.AudioMIDISetup.plist /Users/Name/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.MIDI.xxxxxx.plist /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist/em/strong  Does anyone know where the Audio MIDI Setup application store it's preferences, and if it's possible to change them via the command line?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W3xah.png" alt="Audio MIDI Setup"  strongUpdate:/strong With strongfs_usage/strong I've found that the only file that's called (by strongcoreaudiod/strong) when changing AirPort device (both in Audio MIDI setup and in the Sound preference pane) is strongem/Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist/em/strong - however, that file does not exist(?).  precode10:55:29.548583  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000070   coreaudiod.6108520 10:55:29.548621  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000036   coreaudiod.6108520 10:55:29.548657  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000034   coreaudiod.6108520 10:55:29.548692  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000034   coreaudiod.6108520 10:55:29.548727  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000034   coreaudiod.6108520 10:55:29.548762  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000034   coreaudiod.6108520 10:55:29.551067  read              F=4    B=0x20                                                                                                                                                                              0.000024   coreaudiod.6152896 10:55:29.557136  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000069   coreaudiod.6108520 10:55:29.557338  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000045   coreaudiod.6108520 10:55:29.557455  stat64                                 /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.ServerSettings.plist                                                                                                       0.000041   coreaudiod.6108520 /code/pre  Thanks.  <comment168770> Hi, check this thread on Apple forum: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3554173?tstart=0 <comment168785> Hi, I'm afraid that solution only lets me change the output _device_ (From Built-in Output to AirPlay to external DAC etc.) - I need to specify the AirPlay _source_ (I have multiple AirPlay devices), that can only be done in the Audio MIDI Setup application, not in the Sound Pref pane.
