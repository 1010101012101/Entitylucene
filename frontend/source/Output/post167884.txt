Export compressed videos from quicktime screencast / screenrecording <body> I create quite a few screencasts to show colleagues how to do more complex tasks and share bugs that i am finding.  For this I use the codeFile &gt; Screenrecording/code feature in quicktime.   Once im done recording i save the video to the relevant location, but the exported videos are often 20-30mb even for a relatively short one.    What i tend to do at the moment is then run these videos through Handbrake (open source video compressing software) which gets the videos down to a much more manageable (email-able) size, usually between 2-5mb.  The only issue with this is its another step, and involves opening other software letting it process etc.   Is there a built in export / compression tool in quicktime where i can export smaller videos ?  <answer167907> The easy way is to export instead of save. You can go to File → Export → iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch &amp; Apple TV...  Then pick an option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGqZ7.png" alt="enter image description here"   iPod touch &amp; iPhone 3GS is the one that give you the smaller file size with a resolution of 640×400.  For the screenshot I test it with a video of 6.9 MB.
