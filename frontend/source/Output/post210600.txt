Does the new 12" MacBook (2015) allow for dual displays, or just display mirroring? <body> I have been unable to determine if the new 12" MacBook (the one with the USB-C port), when hooked up to an external monitor, will only mirror its retina display, or if it has the ability to use the external display for separate content.  <answer210603> You get two distinct, functioning displays unless you choose to mirror. Same with AirPlay.  From http://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/ :     Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution [2304 by 1440] on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors
