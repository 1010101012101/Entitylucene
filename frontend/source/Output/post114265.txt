Mail.app can't connect to network (can't reach servers) <body> One day I woke up and could not use my Mail.app anymore :( Mail can't connect to any my account related server, either POP, IMAP or SMTP  Why ? I don't know.  In Log file I see that:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0NA8Y.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  When I try to check internet connection with Mail.app built in tool, it shows me the next:  precodeINITIATING CONNECTION Dec 18 11:53:41.944 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNone] -- host:imap.gmail.com -- port:993 -- socket:0x6180002db7b0 -- thread:0x600000663140 /code/pre  and this message repeated many times (in detail window) for all accounts. Meantime in log file I can see these lines:  precode18.12.13 11:53:41,983 Mail[23206]: [LogSocketErrors] Connecting failed for socket: 0x6000004cc400, error: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=65 "Не удалось завершить операцию. Нет маршрутизации" 18.12.13 11:53:41,983 Mail[23206]: [LogSocketErrors] Connecting failed for socket: 0x6100002c5e10, error: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=65 "Не удалось завершить операцию.

Нет маршрутизации" /code/pre  I guess Little snitch might be the reason, but I have used it for ages and no any problems, I did not change anything in it for a last few days, and only Mail.app has such problems now. Chrome and everything else does not have such issue. Moreover nothing has been changed when I turned off Little snitch. It just does not helped :(  P.S. My OS version is 10.9    I can confirm that Safari has the same issue, I'm sure that it is related with DNS somehow, and that some applications use internal DNS mechanism and others don't. I have an idea - maybe it is related with Bonjour service. going to check...
