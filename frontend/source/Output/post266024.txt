Accessing iPad Pages Data when App No Longer Shared <body> I was removed from my family sharing plan on my iPad and my Pages app says it is no longer shared with the iPad, despite my Apple account also having the Pages app. I will not be able to get the password of the Family Sharing account Pages seems to be using, so there seems to be no way for me to access my saved Pages through the iPad as I can no longer open the app.  Would there be any way for me to retrieve the documents? Syncing with iCloud was not set up beforehand. If I delete and redownload Pages, to my knowledge all the documents will be removed.  I am able to backup the iPad locally, but I am unsure if the backup saved any Pages data if I then tried to restore from backup. Are there any solutions?
