Exchange Calendar syncing issue on Maverics <body> I have an Exchange calendar synced with Mavericks' Calendar app. I've changed time of one event. Since that a window with following message appears over and over:     Calendar can’t delete an occurrence from the repeating the event   “[event]” from the Exchange server.   I've tried to re-add the calendar as well as the whole Exchange account. Deleting the codeCalendar Cache*/code files (in code~/Library/Calendars/code) screws up all calendar data and I'm not able to re-add the synced calendars.  I've all calendars synced in cloud (iCloud, Google, Exchange), so deleting the Calendar files is no issue.  <answer142727> After trial and error, these actions finally solved this issue:  ol liDelete Exchange account from Internet Accounts in System Settings/li liClean User and System cache with Onyx/li liRestart Computer/li liRe-add the Exchange account/li /ol  Tested on MacOS 10.9.4.  <comment167564> It says it is a "Repeating" event ! <comment167569> Yes, it is. Only one event of this series was changed. Does this matter?
