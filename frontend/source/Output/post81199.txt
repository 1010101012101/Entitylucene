Anyone else having issues with the weather app? <body> So I jail role with the new evasi0n tool and now I can't launch my weather app. Anyone else experiencing similar problems?  <answer81202> This has been noted on a couple of blogs. The jailbreak screwed up some files. There is a fix which requires you to:  ( taken from cult of mac  ol liOpen Cydia and install Open SSH and MobileTerminal/li liLoad MobileTerminal and type “su root” (no quotes). Then hit enter./li liEnter your password. It’s probably “alpine” if you haven’t changed it yet./li liCopy and paste the following script into MobileTerminal  precode#!/bin/bash chmod -x /usr/libexec/mobile_installation_proxy killall -9 mobile_installation_proxy rm /var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installation.plist /var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.LaunchServices-045.csstore launchctl stop com.apple.mobile.installd launchctl start com.apple.mobile.installd while [ ! -f /var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installation.plist ]; do sleep 1 done while [ ! -f /var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.LaunchServices-045.csstore ]; do sleep 1 done sleep 10 chmod +x /usr/libexec/mobile_installation_proxy /code/pre  sync/li /ol  reboot 5.
