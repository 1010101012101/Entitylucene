Change user name <body> I had to change the admin user name of a new Macbook because his sons name kept showing up, Home Folder etc, So I used,  'codesudo mv /Users/oldusername /Users/newusername/code' and Advanced Options in User account.  Now this has worked very well apart from iBooks! iBooks still has the 'oldusername' in it's path.  Don't know what I've done wrong!!!  codesudo mv /Users/oldname/Library/Containers?com.apple.BKAgentService?Data?Documents?ibooks/books/ Users/newname/Library/Containers?com.apple.BKAgentService?Data?Documents?ibooks/books/code  Would this work ?, I am not very good with terminal.  Any help would be appreciated.  <answer151654> The command should be:  precode$sudo mv /Users/oldname/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/ibooks/books  /Users/newname/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/ibooks/books /code/pre  This is assuming that there was not an existing user "newname" with it's own uid. Then you may run into permissions problems.  Hope this helps!
