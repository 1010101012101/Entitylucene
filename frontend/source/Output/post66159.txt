How to mute bootup sound? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do I disable or get rid of the startup sound my Mac makes?       I have an old MacBook Pro (pre-unibody) running OS 10.6. I am annoyed by the traditional Macintosh bootup sound, which I want to mute permanently.  I've tried some proposed solutions:  ul liRemembering to reduce the volume before I shut the computer down. It works, but it's not reasonable to do this./li liPressing the "Mute" button while booting up the computer. Seems to be the F3 key on my old MacBook, but that doesn't work./li liInstalling and using the application StartupSound. It didn't work. I read in forums that other users share this problem./li /ul  Am I doing something wrong, or is there another solution to my problem?   <answer66167> StartupSound works for me. It's true that it is sometimes not totally OK, but if you set different sounds volume, or check-unchech the mute radio button, finally it does the job.    <comment77822> Thanks, I will give it a second chance. :-) <comment77865> Gave it another shot, it didn't work. Seemed like the mute box setting was lost upon reboot. Disappointed, I then toggled the mute checkbox a couple of times, dragged the sound volume slider and clicked the lock icon to protect the settings from being changed. Voil√†! That finally worked, rebooted twice with loud regular volume setting with no boot sound! I was too quick to conclude that the program doesn't work.
