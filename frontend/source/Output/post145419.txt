Mac App Store apps not opening <body> Overnight a lot of my Mac App Store purchased apps will not open. I get the error message:      "Tweetbot" is damaged and can't be opened. Delete "Tweetbot" and   download it again from the App Store.   I've done this several times, and restarted my computer. What else can I try to get these apps working again?  I'm running OS X 10.9.4.  <comment171389> It is not your Twitter app. <comment171391> Try this, no guaranties it will work for you.   In Terminal, run "xattr -rc /Volumes/Application.app", that should fix it (naturally, replace "/Volumes/Application.app" with your actual application path. No need to disable GateKeeper. <comment171393> Unfortunately that doesn't work. <comment171395> Something wrong with your HDD!, did you do something to it recently? <comment171397> Did you change your setting for the Gate Keeper ? <comment171398> No to both questions. <comment171400> To check your account, log in as Guest and try now.
