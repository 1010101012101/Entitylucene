I keep getting the error from code/usr/bin/autom4te/code Am I missing something?  Thank you for your help!  EDIT: I've opened an issue here https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/20586  <answer95227> I went ahead and renamed the files codeautoconf/code, codeautoheader/code, codeautom4te/code, codeautoreconf/code, codeautoscan/code, codeautoupdate/code and codeifnames/code in code/usr/bin/code to force my machine to use the ones made available in code/usr/local/bin/code after a codebrew link --force autoconf/code.  Brewing worked without an issue.  I don't know where the files in code/usr/bin//code came from or if I borked things up bad by doing this. I'm keeping the renamed files in place, just in case I ever remember what I did today when things start to stink.  (see https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/20586 for more troubleshooting)  <comment138989> These files are from Apples's Xcode and removing them is not a good idea.
