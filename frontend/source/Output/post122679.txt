Access to many websites under OS X Server on port 80 <body> I've installed two web applications (Jenkins and Redmine) on my OS X Mavericks Server. Both are available in local network from other computers as:  ul limyserver.local:8080 (Jenkins)/li limyserver.local:8081/redmine (Redmine installed from Bitnami)/li /ul  Also I redirect to domains to my public IP:  ul lici.mydomain.com/li lipm.mydomain.com/li /ul  At this moment I'm able to get access to my web applications from the Internet in this way:  ul lici.mydomain.com:8080 (Jenkins)/li lipm.mydomain.com:8081 (Redmine)/li /ul  Now I want to change this configuration to more friendly form which allow to get access to this applications directly by enter only domains like:  ul lici.mydomain.com/li lipm.mydomain.com/li /ul  Do you have any suggestion what and where should I change in my server configuration to get this result (access many sites on default 80 port)?  <answer122707> You need a web server in front of your sites, acting as a proxy.  With Apache web server, use the mod_proxy module (I think on Apache you'll need to enable the module from httpd.conf, by uncommenting the line starting with codeLoadModule proxy_http_module/code).  If you prefer nginx, use the http_proxy module.  Both are pretty much straight forward to configure.
