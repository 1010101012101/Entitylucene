Can't rename directory by changing upper- to lower-case on hfs+ partition in Ubuntu <body> I'm new to Linux, and just installed Ubuntu 17.04 on a dual-boot MacBook. I'm having trouble with directories I'm creating on an hfs+ partition (created with gparted, so I can see files on it when booted into OS X). I'm assuming the confusion has to do with the hfs+ format being case-insensitive, but then, shouldn't it really be case insensitive, whether I'm working on it via Ubuntu or OS X? Here's the scenario:  ol liCreated directory "DropBox" via Nautilus./li liTried to rename "DropBox" to "Dropbox" but got error message: 'The item could not be renamed. The name "Dropbox" is already in use...'./li liTried deleting "DropBox" (permanently, not to Trash) and creating new directory "Dropbox". When I did that, both directories appeared ("DropBox" and "Dropbox")./li liTried deleting "DropBox", but both directories were deleted. Looked in Terminal; while both "DropBox" and "Dropbox" are visible in Nautilus, running `ls -a shows only "DropBox"./li liStill in Terminal, deleted "DropBox" (rm -R DropBox). As expected, this resulted in there being no dropbox folder of any sort. However, in Nautilus, I still see "Dropbox", until I try to open it, at which time I get an error that says it doesn't really exist, and then it disappears from Nautilus, too./li liIn Terminal, re-create the directory (mkdir Dropbox). The directory is recreated as "DropBox" again, and shows up as such in Nautilus as well./li /ol  Here is the mount options for the drive: code/dev/sdb2 on /data type hfsplus (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,umask=22,uid=0,gid=0,nls=utf8)/code  Dropbox is not yet synced to this directory, so I know it has nothing to do with Dropbox.  Is there any way around this issue, or is it unavoidable when using hfs+?  <answer296245> After digging around further, I found the solution to this issue. strongIt is actually possible to format an hfs+ partition in OS X as case-sensitive, unjournaled/strong, though it takes two steps. There's no way to switch an existing case-insensitive partition to case-sensitive.  The option to disable journaling (or to format a vol as case-sensitive, not journaled) has been removed from the OS X Disk Utility in El Capitan (which is the version I'm running) but it can still be done:  ol liDepending on how the disk is partitioned, it might be necessary to carve out the disk space first on Linux (using codegparted/code is the easiest way). I'm fairly sure it doesn't matter what type of partition, but just to be careful, I created it as hfs+ to make sure there were no weird access issues on the OS X side./li liIn OS X, use Disk Utility to format the partition as strongHFS+ Case-Sensitive, Journaled/strong. (It should be possible to do in Terminal using codediskutil/code, as well, but I didn't want to take the time to hunt down the syntax for case-sensitivity)./li liStill in OS X, in Terminal, run codediskutil disableJournal /dev/volname/code. You can run this with the disk mounted or unmounted. (If you're not sure of the disk or volume name, codediskutil list/code will list them all)./li /ol  emSide note/em: From the number of posted questions on the subject, it appears that mounting hfs+ as rw in Ubuntu is problematic for many. The syntax for designating mount of an hfs+ partition as rw in fstab (code/etc/fstab/code is used by the system to mount devices at boot) is codeUUID=&lt;UUID&gt; /mountpoint hfsplus rw,exec,auto,users 0 0/code, assuming you want the typical options for a non-system data vol. If you want something different, this article is really helpful. You will also probably need to codechown -R user /mountpoint/code the mountpoint.  And that's it. I tested it out back in Ubuntu, using the same "DropBox" name change test I used before, and it all looks good.
