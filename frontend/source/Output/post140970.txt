Using AppleScript to toggle Internet Sharing not working <body> I am using an applescript to activate internet sharing option from 'System Pref Sharing'. I work on MacOs 10.9.4. I found this script on a forum and am using it. This works fine, when the System Preferences window is open. However,when the System Preferences window is closed, the script opens the System Prefs window and then displays this error message:   precode System Events got an error: Canâ€™t get menu item \"Sharing\" of menu \"View\" of menu bar 1 of process \"System Preferences\"." number -1728 from menu item "Sharing" of menu "View" of menu bar 1 of process "System Preferences" /code/pre  This is the code for the script    precodetell application "System Preferences"         activate     end tell     tell application "System Events"         activate         tell process "System Preferences"              click menu item "Sharing" of menu "View" of menu bar 1             delay 2             tell window "Sharing"... //code after this  /code/pre  I am not proficient in AppleScript ,but only need to use this one to get a keyboard shortcut for toggling internet sharing. Also, the forum I got it from says the other users are able to use the script. I wonder if it has something to do with MAcOs 10.9   <answer140986> Another way to open System Preferences to the Sharing pane is...  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preferences.sharing" end tell /code/pre  This will work whether System Preferences is open or not.  <answer190400> You can use this code to activate sharing with settings which were already there:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preferences.sharing" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"      --find lock and click it if it is not unlocked     repeat with x in buttons of window "Sharing"         try             if (value of attribute "AXTitle" of x) is equal to "Click the lock to make changes." then                 click x             end if         end try     end repeat     delay 5      --find the checkbox for Internet Sharing and select the row so script can enable sharing through ethernet     repeat with r in rows of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window "Sharing"         if (value of static text of r as text) starts with "Internet" then             select r         end if     end repeat     delay 2      --enable Internet Sharing     repeat with r in rows of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window "Sharing"         if (value of static text of r as text) starts with "Internet" then             set sharingBool to value of checkbox of r as boolean             select r             if sharingBool is false then click checkbox of r         end if     end repeat     delay 2      if (exists sheet 1 of window "Sharing") then         click button "Start" of sheet 1 of window "Sharing"     end if     delay 2  end tell ignoring application responses     tell application "System Preferences" to quit end ignoring /code/pre  Hope this helps!
