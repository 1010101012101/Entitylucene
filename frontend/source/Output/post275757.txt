Display Dock on the main screen on left when second screen is arranged to left <body> I've this arrangment of screens, and I've set the dock to stay on the left side.  The problem is that the dock goes on the second screen, while i want to keep it on the main one (the one with the white bar basically).   Any idea?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JO9NZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment346946> System Prefs  Mission Control  Displays have separate Spaces. Checked, the dock will follow you, unchecked it will stay on the primary monitor. <comment346948> well, no. if the dock is on the left it goes on the second screen, or am I miss something? Only the top bar remains in the main screen <comment346952> ah - you have the dock vertical? Then yes, it will always go to the extreme edge, it can't stop in the middle. <comment346955> wow, nice to know, i think that a lot of people use it on the left, and probably those people are right handed, so the mac cannot stay on the right since using an external keyboard and mouse would be complicated (i keep hitting the mac with the mouse). @apple: think about that ;) <comment346956> I've never actually met anyone who used the dock vertically, not in 25 years of using Macs. We oldies just leave it where it is, at the bottom ;-) <comment346957> I'm a special guy, mom always said so.. seriously, on the small screen it saves a lot of space since the screen is rectangular with short edes on the sides. even on windows i used to do that :) . If you have a dock that autohides then it may be the same, don't know
