$PATH error on a terminal <body> Before you raise your pitchforks, this is NOT another "How do I change my $PATH variable value?" question. I had installed Oh my zsh on my machine(Macbook Pro), and didn't like it. So I uninstalled it.  Ever since I installed it I get the following when I run the $PATH command:  precodeAnups-xxxx-xxx% $PATH zsh: no such file or directory: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin /code/pre  How do I get rid of the bit that says codezsh: no such file or directory/code. Thanks in advance!  <answer58034> Okay, so you've got a good understanding of $PATH and how it's used, but you're mistaken in thinking that it's a command. In Bash (and other shells), words prefaced by a dollarsign are variables. You can change the value of $PATH with the codeexport/code command (as you probably already know).  codeexport PATH=$PATH:/path/to/something/you/need/bin/code  So in your shell when you just type code$PATH/code you're basically telling your shell to run the command code/usr/bin/:/bin/:/usr/local/bin:/etc//etc//etc//code which isn't a valid shell command.  @patrix was right, you should use codeecho/code to inspect your $PATH. I suspect that the "zsh: no such file or directory" is just your shell telling you that your command doesn't make sense.  <comment66699> err, there is no $PATH command. If you want to see your PATH you have to run `echo $PATH`.
