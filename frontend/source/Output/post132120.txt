Connect Win7 notebook display to iMac <body> I'm looking for a solution to extend my Windows 7 based notebook display to my iMac. The notebook provides the following connectors:  1x VGA  1x Displayport  1x Expresscard/34  I have already tried to connect both computers via Displayport to Thunderbolt adapter but tests showed up that my iMac only supports Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt connections. I have also tried to connect them accross network based software solutions but the notebook firewall which is not under my control prevented this. Any further ideas?  <answer132126> Your iMac can only support TDM using thunderbolt connections, and as such can not be connected to your laptop. You can learn more about TDM in this article  <comment155276> It would help if you listed the model of the iMac <comment155280> Model 21,5" iMac i7 bought in January 2012 <comment155281> Thank you for your answer. Somehow I hoped that some kind of real Displayport to Thunderbolt gateway adapter exists that allow me to overcome that limitation. <comment155282> that kind of adapter does not exist, the thunderbolt signal needs to come from your pc and no adapter can just "make up" that signal. <comment155284> Do you know if a corresponding USB 3.0 or Expresscard/34 to Thunderbolt converter exists? <comment155285> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about connecting non-Apple hardware to Apple hardware. <comment155287> there are some adapters out there but they all rely on the host computer to have the thunderbolt port and in your case it is the other way around. <comment155288> Somehow I feared that answer. In that case I will try to convince the companys firewall department to open the required network flows to implement a software based solution. Anyway thanks a lot for your support. <comment155291> Yw, too bad there isn't a easier solution, consider accepting the answer if it solved your question. <comment155294> @Rob That doesn't make this question off-topicâ€”it involves Apple hardware therefore is within the scope. <comment155359> This involves target display mode, so it's clearly on topic.
