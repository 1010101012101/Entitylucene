How do I take a screenshot on my Mac? <body> What's the easiest way to take a screenshot of my Mac?  I've used codeGrab.app/code, but it's a bit annoying just to get a quick screenshot. Is there a faster way?  <answer3824> kbdcmd/kbd  kbdshift/kbd  kbd3/kbd takes a screenshot of the entire current Desktop (all attached monitors, as separate shots].  kbdcmd/kbd  kbdshift/kbd  kbd4/kbd takes a screenshot of a dragged selection.  kbdcmd/kbd  kbdshift/kbd  kbd4/kbd then kbdspace/kbd (you must press kbdspace/kbd separately) then click, to take a screenshot of a specific window.br Holding kbd Opt ‚å• /kbd  as you click will remove the drop-shadow.  Add kbdcontrol/kbd to the shortcuts above to place the screen shot on the clipboard instead of saving it to the desktop.  <answer6296> Also you may define a shortcut key for copying the selected area to clipboard as I did.   Here is how:  ol liSystem Preferences/li liSelect Keyboard Pane/li liSelect Keyboard Shortcuts tab/li liSelect Screen Shots from left menu/li liDouble click to the shortcut option of "Copy picture of selected area to the clipboard" and define a key that rarely used (eg:F13)/li /ol  And done! From now on, when press that key, the area selection pointer appears and after you select the region on the screen, it copies the picture to the clipboard and you may paste anywhere.  Hope it helps...   <comment3602> Thanks, that is easy! I like the shadows on the windows! These keyboard shortcuts seem to dump the screenshots on my desktop which is OK, but is there a way to copy them directly to my clipboard instead, sort of like the "PrntScr" key in Windows? <comment3604> @Airplane I edited my answer you can use control for that job. <comment3713> You can alter the place that screenshots get saved using some of the populate hidden-tweaks apps like 'secrets', or use the Terminal to execute this command: `defaults write com.apple.screencapture location -path full path to the location`, e.g. /Users/YourName/Screenshots <comment170341> If you use [Snagit](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) or [Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/), you don't need to press all those keyboard shortcuts, you just need to activate their screenshot functionality and drag your mouse to capture any parts on the screen. Plus, those programs offers more functions like editing and sharing. <comment345590> Related, but not an exact duplicate: [How do I take screenshots of the Touch Bar?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/263424/how-do-i-take-screenshots-of-the-touch-bar)
