How to install and run nautilus using macports (or any other way) <body> I've installed macports and then done 'sudo port install nautilus' to install nautilus, which all works fine. Now i'm not sure how to actually run nautilus - there's no app in the applications, and if i do 'nautilus' from the terminal it simply throws up a lot of errors.  Am i missing something?  Thanks  And the errors are below:  precode:~ $ nautilus  Dynamic session lookup supported but failed: launchd did not provide a socket path, verify that org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist is loaded!

Read the output of the command codeport notes dbus/code and follow the instructions.  precode$ port notes dbus dbus has the following notes:   ############################################################################   # Startup items have been generated that will aid in   # starting dbus with launchd. They are disabled   # by default. Execute the following command to start them,   # and to cause them to launch at startup:   #   # sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist   # launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist   ############################################################################ /code/pre  <comment8667> Is X11 running? <comment8669> It starts XQuartz automatically when i run the 'nautilus' command, is that the same thing? <comment8672> yes that is roughly the same thing.
