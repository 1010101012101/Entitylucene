Midi problem with keyboard brand "Medeli" brand "M15" on a Macbook pro Late 2013 model <body> I have a macbook late 2013. I've tried on OS 10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12.  I have this keyboard and when I try midi with it the computer simply won't read it at all. It doesnt is show up in Midi setup studio and even in the midi monitor application I downloaded. I did some tests and restarted my mac and it reads for the first 5-10seconds of the start up and then it disappears from midi setup studios and midi monitors, but the notes did read for those 5-10seconds which is really strange. Any suggestions?  P.s. on the medeli website they state that the keyboards are plug and play and the drivers are automatically downloaded on to the computer and they don't have anywhere listed for manual download for drivers.  Also do you think it is because maybe this keyboard doesn't work with usb ports 3.0? I heard something about on the internet. If so what can I do?  Thanks, Will
