In a table, how to get columns (rather than rows) to be coloured? <body> I'm running Pages 5.0 on Yosemite.  In my table, the rows are alternately blue and white.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a1Zsw.png" alt="enter image description here"  I want exactly this, only I want the strongcoloumns/strong to be coloured rather than the rows.  I want to make it look liks this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lfYkx.png" alt="enter image description here"  I created this latter image in Photoshop, I don't know how to bring it about in Pages. The lines got a bit weakened in this image, but that's not intentional.  I've looked through the various table menus and settings, but I don't see any obvious way to do it. Also, this is somewhat tricky to google for.  <comment334229> I don't believe that this is natively possible at this time. Your best bet, as I see it, would be to try to write a macro or script of some sort which can do it semi-automatically.
