Reduce colors from Millions to Thousands <body> I was trying to run a Keynote presentation on a secondary display and Keynote told me that I didn't have enough video RAM and either needed to reduce the resolution or number of colors from Millions to Thousands.  I know how to change the resolution, but how do I change the number of colors?    Thanks!  <answer2506> For some reason, the option to change color depth was removed in Snow Leopard. SwitchResX can still do it I think, but that's shareware (10-day demo).  <comment2211> I have SwitchResX and didn't see that option.  Too bad they removed it.  Guess I am stuck.  I'll look at SwitchResX again though.  Thanks!
