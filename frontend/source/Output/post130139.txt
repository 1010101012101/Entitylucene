Adding text around a circle with pages <body> How do I add text around a circle I'm using for a logo?  I have a circle filled in with some initials on the inside.  I want to add the company name around the outside of the circle.  <answer130143> This is not a feature Pages '09 or Pages '13 provides (unlike Microsoft Word with the Wordart).   As XAleXOwnZX suggested you definitely should look at softwares that are made for what you want like InkScape or Illustrator.
