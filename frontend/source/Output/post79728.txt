How to map Caps Lock as a second Control Key on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000? <body> I've got a strongMicrosoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000/strong, with the latest IntelliType drivers installed. There is an option to swap a strongCaps Lock/strong and a strongControl key/strong in the strongMicrosoft Keyboard/strong preferences pane, but no way to use strongCaps Lock/strong as a second strongControl key/strong.   Changing the Modifier Keys in strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard/strong helps, but resets after the restart. Reset happens only when strongMicrosoft Keyboard Helper/strong is launched. These settings were always saved after the restart with another third-party keyboard I've been using before.  Using strongControllerMate/strong helps, but it's slow, buggy and, obviously, a huge overkill for my needs.  strongKeyRemap4MacBook/strong and strongPCKeyboardHack/strong are not working. I guess Microsoft Keyboard driver overrules them.  Repairing permissions does not help either.  <answer88049> Two months went past, and a "legitimate" solution is nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, there is a simpler and a more radical way to solve this, and all related issues — getting rid of the crappy Microsoft drivers completely. kbdCaps Lock/kbd, and other modifier key mappings, are easily changed in the "Keyboard" preferences. kbdPlay/Pause/kbd, kbdVolume/kbd and kbdMute/kbd keys are working perfectly. All of the other media keys, and the "Zoom" slider are predictably dead, but I've never used them anyway. The "Application" or "Menu key" is mapped to kbd⌘/kbd with KeyRemap4MacBook.
