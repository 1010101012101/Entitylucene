Upgrade/Move OpenSSL in OS X to alternate Apache version/folder location <body> We are running a Mac Apache web server.  It currently has OpenSSL/0.9.7l running on it which is not compatible with SHA2.  OpenSSL is running within a special user-interface called iTools 9; iTools is a program which installs its own version of Apache and accessories in a separate folder on the Mac than the Apple version of Apache.  I need to upgrade the iTools version of Apache to OpenSSL/0.9.8 or later to be able to install an SHA2 certificate.  Can I just "copy" the files from the Mac OS Apache version of OpenSSL (which is the newer version we need) over to the the folder with the iTools version of Apache?  If so, what exact files/folders would I need to replace in the iTools Apache folder to complete the upgrade of OpenSSL?  Or, is there a better/easier way to upgrade the OpenSSL version running in the other folder on our Mac?  FYI... Our server is running Mac OS 10.6.8 (normal, not server version).  We have to stick with this older OS for another year or two because of several legacy "Rosetta" upgrades we use on our website extensively.  Best wishes,  ul liJeff/li /ul  <comment261850> The obvious one is because you are using iTools to manage Apache then upgrade iTools - as for OS X 10.6.8 Apple have stopped prviding security updates so you are taking a risk running it if open to the internet. I would get a mac mini or Linux box to run am up to date OS and  Apache on
