Gathering statistics in Mac Dictation <body> Is there any way to log the use of / gather statistics in Mac Dictation, such as the following:  ul liUse of commands (e.g. log codecommand name, timestamp/code)/li liUse of words (e.g. log codewordl, timestamp/code)/li /ul  ?  <comment190195> I don't use the feature myself, but maybe the Console (located in `Applications - Utilities`) logs these commands? Try the following: Open the Console, go to All Messages, start Dictation, use a command or word, see if it gets logged in the Console. <comment247830> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247831> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
