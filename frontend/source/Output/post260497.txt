Mac collapses doing a partition <body> I have a MacBook Pro whose HDD has S.M.A.R.T. errors, so I would like to install OS X in a external hard disk. However, it has some copies of Time Machine, so I need to do a partition. The problem comes when I try this: at some point (not always the same one), the computer just collapses or, if the screen was black, it keeps on like that, so I have to shut down, and when I restart it seems lie nothing happened. Does anyone know what should I do? I'm going to try to create the partition using another Mac as soon as possible.  It's my first question here, hope I'm not doing so bad!  <comment326180> So your MacBook Pro suddenly closes its screen? That's what collapse means <comment326193> It's the US election, it's even causing computers to collapse. <comment326350> @Yamir4 Use the same account you used to post the question to be able to comment on your posts here and to edit your question directly.
