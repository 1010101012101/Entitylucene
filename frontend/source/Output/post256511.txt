Getting Applescript to Find File Recursively <body> Can anyone help me with some code that will recursively find, say, a folder with 'Lounge' in the name which could be two folders deep in the folder I'm searching in?   I'm making an Applescript droplet that helps me file my music into genre folders.     I'm ok with the rest, just need a snippet so that if I click on the dialog 'Lounge &amp; Exotica', Finder will move the file concerned to the folder identified.  Here's the bit of code I can't get to work:  precodetell application "Finder"       set theItems to "Macintosh HD:Users:Tardy:Tardy Stuff:Scripts &amp; Automator Actions:Music Pre-Filing System" as alias       set folderNames to name of every folder of entire contents of theItems       get items of folderNames whose name contains "Lounge &amp; Exotica"   end tell /code/pre  I keep getting this message:     Canâ€™t get {"Jazz &amp; Popular Song", "Other", "Rock", "Soul", "Lounge &amp; Exotica", "Modern Jazz", "Pop. Song", "Swing", "Comedy &amp; Novelty &amp; Christmas", "Other", "Spoken", "50s &amp; 60s Rock", "70s &amp; 80s Rock", "90s-now Rock", "Rap", "Reggae", "Soul", "Blues &amp; Gospel", "Classical", "Folk &amp; World", "Warped &amp; Electronic"} whose name contains "Lounge &amp; Exotica".   Not sure if it's helpful to list my folder structure here? So one folder contains the following folders/subfolders:  precodeJazz &amp; Popular Song     Lounge &amp; Exotica     Modern Jazz     Pop. Song     Swing Rock     50s &amp; 60s Rock     70s &amp; 80s Rock     90s-now Rock Soul     Rap     Reggae     Soul Other     Comedy &amp; Novelty &amp; Christmas         Other         Blues &amp; Gospel         Classical         Folk &amp; World         Warped &amp; Electronic     Spoken /code/pre  It seems like it should be so easy to just get Applescript to get a folder matching a name, but I've tried every variation on aliases/text/variables that I can think of!  <comment320038> Yes, that's correct klanomath. Thanks <comment320042> I think it's helpful to post the whole AppleScript! <comment320128> I realize the questions have differences, but the underlying issue is the structure of the statement in both questions where the user is attempting to match a string against a list of folders from Finder. The exact statement you need is at the bottom of the answer in that question, and it actually replaces two of your code lines, so even better!
