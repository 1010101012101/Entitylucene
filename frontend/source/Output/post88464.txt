Safari web browser do not find strings on a page in the common way <body> How to switch Safari to a emnormal/em web page searching instead of finding only whole words?  Ex: there ase some words on a page: hello_world, ask_different. When I search for hello, world, ask, different - i search perfectly. But when I'm trying to search emello/em, emifferent/em, etc. - it gives me nothing.  <answer88468> The find banner was set to match the starts of words by default in Safari 5.1:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNzZy.png" alt=""  This makes it default to Contains:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari FindOnPageMatchesWordStartsOnly -bool false /code/pre  You have to quit and reopen Safari to apply the changes.
