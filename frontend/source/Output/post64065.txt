After my MacBook Pro sleeps some gestures don't work anymore <body> When I wake my MacBook Pro (mid 2012 - with Mountain Lion) from sleep, sometimes some complicated gesture doesn't work anymore with the Trackpad or Magic Mouse.  Changing screens (with 4 fingers with trackpad or with 2 fingers with the mouse), getting Mission Control with 4 fingers, dragging windows with 3 fingers: they all don't work.  Clicks, taps, two fingers gestures still work though.  I have tried to change the configuration of the trackpad but it doesn't work.   Changing screen with kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdLeft Arrow/kbd or kbdRight Arrow/kbd still work too.  What can I do to restart these features without restarting the computer (when I restart of course it works again like a charm)?  <answer64073> A workaround is to bring up Terminal and then type "killall Dock" at the prompt which restarts the dock. This fixes the problem. Itâ€™s odd that Apple have failed to pick up this bug at the last update. It seems to be pretty commonplace.  <comment75177> Exactly the good way to do it, thanks !!
