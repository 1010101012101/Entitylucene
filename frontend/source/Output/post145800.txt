Gatekeeper Configuration Data 14.0 <body> I recently received Gatekeeper Configuration Data 14.0 installed automatically without any notice on my MBP, it's not shown on the normal "Software Update" list. But can be found via Apple  About This Mac  More Info  System Report  Installations. (OS X 10.8.5)  Did anyone else receive that too? and what is it for? I checked few other Macs none of them have it.  UPDATE: this is a quicker way to check it - click the Apple icon on the top menu, press and hold the alt/option key, it turns "About this Mac" to "System Information" then click.  <answer145915> Read about Gatekeeper here:  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5290 https://www.apple.com/osx/what-is/security.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(OS_X)  I have not seen v14.0 myself,  <comment171945> Did you receive any other versions of it - Gatekeeper Configuration Data? Why I got it on one Mac not the others? Is there anything I should worry about? <comment172057> Yes, I have Version 12.0 on all my machines, but all my machines are on 10.9.4 or 10.10, I don't have a 10.8 machine. It is **not** something you should worry about. <comment172281> Since you mention you only get v12.0 on all your Macs, it seems it doesn't get any further updates once it installed the first one. Anyway I will update this when I have more information about it.
