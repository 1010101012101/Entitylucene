MacBook Pro early 2015 can connect to networks but no internet <body> Ok so around 2 days ago my Mac suddenly didn’t’t have access to the internet. It was connected to the wifi network but wouldn’t connect to the internet via Browser Steam Discord msgs mail etc. I’ve tried this on 4 networks with the same results. The weird thing is that I can still ping google.com youtube.com in the terminal and I get feedback. In system Preferences it says I’m connected to a network but as you read above it doesn’t really matter. I’ve already called apple and done all the troubleshooting resetting smc and the other thing (Forgot the abbreviation) and also going into recovery mode and trying the connection as well as reinstalling the OS. I have tried so hard to get back online but nothing has worked. I am using a Technicolor Tc something router and I used to be able to reach the Dashboard at 10.0.0.1 but now it comes up with Unable to connect. I’ve also tried a different router and modem and same result. Please Help I've also used Ethernet as well as wifi. It might be good to add that the handoff functionality still works  <comment363170> While connected either by wire or by wi-fi, go to System Preferences  Network  Advanced... button  TCP/IP tab and click the Renew DHCP Lease button. Does this help?
