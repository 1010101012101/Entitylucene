JIRA desktop app <body> Does anyone know of any good desktop applications for Atlassian JIRA, preferably free/open-source?  hr  h3Possible solutions I found:/h3     h2Majic/h2      It is no longer maintained by the developer, I tried to run it anyway and it threw an NSURL error when I attempted to login with it so I'm assuming it doesn't work anymore..   hr     h2Bee/h2      Looks good, and may go with this but it's $29 per license and I'd prefer something free, open-source would be ideal.   hr     h2JiraPal/h2      An open source app I found on Github that looked very promising but is apparently no longer maintained.  I was able to successfully build it but was not able to successfully connect it to my Jira site. :(   hr     h2Jirasic/h2      Discovered this from a posted answer below.  Looks awesome but have not beenable to build it successfully at all.  :(   hr  h3Notes:/h3  A free &amp;/or open-source solution would be preferable and it must work w/ OSX yosemite as a native desktop app or notification bar/widget of some sort.  Dependencies, including Java, would be fine, but I always prefer things to be lightweight and containable without having to run Java, a browser, or any host applications/dependency services.  <answer155744> We used jira for a while and I just loaded it into a fluid instance.   http://fluidapp.com  It is an app that lets you isolate a website into its own browser.  <answer155828> Not exactly lightweight, but it's free (and the underlying technology is open source): Atlassian Eclipse Connector  https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/IDEPLUGIN/Installing+the+Eclipse+Connector  If you're already using Eclipse, it would fit in nicely with your existing setup.  <answer188757> I'm also amazed that so little alternatives exist for this. My problem is tracking the time, not the issues boards, so i'm building a plain simple tool for that. The way it works is when you finish a task you open the app from the status bar and write some details of what you've done, and that's all. You will have this list synced on your iphone so you can read them next day in the scrum meeting. When you feel like you can transfer the tasks to jira timesheet but i'm working on automating this. Take it from here, might not be free forever https://github.com/ralcr/Jira-Logger  <answer188762> I would give Fluid app a vote instead.  I personally tried Bee, doesn't meet my requirements and it looks pretty incomplete.  <answer249400> I use the jira in webstorm. You can try it.  <comment183494> I'm not using Eclipse.  But since you mentioned it, I'm going to check out the similar plugin for PHPStorm. <comment227820> This looks amazing but how do I build it?  I tried opening the xcodeproj and running it as is but get a bunch of Switch compiler errors.  Thx.
