Spotlight not working with Netgear ReadyNAS <body> I am unable to search AFP shares on a netgear NAS device using spotlight. Spotlight reverts to the default local hard drive. "Shared" is not user selectable. The NAS is using the latest Netgear OS V6. The unit is new and installed 10/2016. Can Spotlight be used to search NAS shares, or is there another application that will resolve this issue? Thanks
