MacBook not asking for password after sleep <body> My mid-2015 MacBook Pro (Sierra 10.12.2) skips the login screen when waking from sleep, it goes straight to my desktop.  I have my System Preferences set to require my password 1 minute after being put to sleep but it doesn't seem to be working.  Anyone have an idea of what the problem might be?  <answer266438> Not sure if you set it in the correct place, but the setting should be at:     ol   liChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, click Security &amp; Privacy, then click General./li   liSelect “Require password… after sleep or screen saver begins.”/li   liClick the pop-up menu and choose the time that passes before a password is required./li   /ol   Source: OS X Yosemite: Require a password after waking your Mac  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8O5wH.png" alt="System Preferences screenshot"  <comment334124> OP already said they have "set to require my password 1 minute after being put to sleep but it doesn't seem to be working". <comment334125> Instead of 1 minute, try out "immediately after sleep". Does it work? <comment334355> That seems to work if I put the mac to sleep and try to start it up again immediately after but if I leave it sleeping for any extended period of time and come back to it, it'll open to my desktop again and skip the login page. <comment334356> I thought it may have been bluetooth related so I also unchecked the "Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer" option in the System Preferences but not luck there either! <comment337414> I have seen the same problem on my mid-2014 15" mbp after update to sierra 10.12.2.
