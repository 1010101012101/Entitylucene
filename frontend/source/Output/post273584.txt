Macbook pro wont boot, Kernel cache read error 0x6 <body> I have recently installed emmacOS Sierra/em and sometimes my emMacbook pro mid-2012/em boots up properly (rarely). Otherwise it does not boot. When I try to boot it with emcmd+v/em , it shows following text:  strongRead error 0x6/strong  strongKernel cache read error 0x6/strong  It's been days since Im facing this issue. Any solution? Right now I'm asking this question using my Mac because it was of of those good times when it did boot properly.  <answer295943> There's probably some sort of corruption in the kernel or Kernel cache.   Best bet would be to backup your data first, just in case, then restart and boot to your recovery volume by holding Command and R before you see the Apple logo.   Eventually you'll be at a window with a few options including reinstalling Mac OS. If you're using wifi then connect to it in the top right corner of the screen. Choose the Reinstall option and follow the prompts, eventually selecting your boot drive as the Reinstall volume.   It might take up to a few hours but you'll have a fresh operating system while preserving your data and should get rid of the kernel issue.   <comment373763> Did you fix it?
