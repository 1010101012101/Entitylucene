OS X Yosemite permanent environement variables <body> Since I upgraded to OS X Yosemite I do have massive problems with environment variables that I really, really NEED for development of some projects.  strongThe Problems is:/strong  Every time I install some kind of update from the app store and my macbook restarts in order to install it, it will delete all, but really all of my environment variables which then costs me nearly an hour to set it up again.  I've tried so many different solutions until now (I don't want to start listing them up here, I really searched the www for some hours...) and nothing has worked as permanent/persistent environment variable.  strongWhat I need to do:/strong  ul liSystem wide environment variables that are NEVER reset without my action. They have to be persistent/permanent!/li liEnvironment variables have to be readable by shell as well as GUI applications/li /ul  I feel helpless and somehow stupid. It's so easy on all linux distros I know and also in the Windows world. Why does it seem to be so hard for OS X?  <answer250307> have you tried adding them to your code.bash_profile/code?   assuming you know how to use the vi editor:  ol liopen terminal/li lienter codevi ~/.bash_profile/code/li liadd one line like the following for each environment variable you need to persist  ul licodeexport PS1='\[\033[34m\]\w\[\e[m\]   '/code/li /ul/li liSave the file. /li liRestart your computer. /li /ol  The only other thing would be to consider backing up your code.bash_profile/code in case somehow you lose or corrupt it.  <comment204366> Please add some examples of variables you lost updating your current system (and how you set them in Yosemite compared to Mavericks). <comment204559> how are you setting them up now?  isn't this easily doable in  ~/.profile ? <comment204567> @venicejeff: not for gui applications. <comment206608> You can find one way to do it here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25385934/setting-environment-variables-via-launchd-conf-no-longer-works-in-os-x-yosemite <comment256132> I still haven't found a proper way. Sometimes my env variables are just gone after a system update (not OS update, just normal updates). I have setup a wiki page and script which I let run whenever they're reset
