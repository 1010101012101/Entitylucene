Delete all texts between two texts <body> A good friend of mine recently spammed my phone with close to a thousand messages... It's technically my fault since I was telling him that he should learn a scripting language. Ooops.  Anyway, is there a way that I can "group delete" text messages (perhaps with an app) instead of individually checking each message or deleting all of them?  <comment199934> did you try to remove the friend <comment199938> Whats wrong with delete the conversation? <comment199940> @soulshined there were some texts worthwhile saving for reference. <comment199942> @AnnonomusPenguin then your out of luck. No way to group delete other than what your doing. You should just take a screen shot of the messages you want for reference, otherwise it will be a long week for you <comment199943> To clarify, no 3rd party app is going to have access to your OS-shipped messages. That should be a privacy red flag to anyone and everyone
