Why is my applescript for checking if a file exists failing? <body> I have an applescript application that inputs a username and starts a download based on that username. In the app I use the code below to check if a file exists already and then rename the file if it does.  precodetell application "Finder" if exists "~/Downloads/Conversion/" &amp; cbUsername &amp; ".flv" as POSIX file then     set x to 1     repeat         set newCbFilename to cbUsername &amp; "_" &amp; x as string         if exists "~/Downloads/Conversion/" &amp; newCbFilename &amp; ".flv" as POSIX file then             set x to x + 1         else             exit repeat         end if     end repeat     copy newCbFilename to finalCbFilename     display dialog "Filename already exists " &amp; "File will be named: " &amp; finalCbFilename &amp; ".flv" buttons "OK" default button "OK" with title "Error" with icon caution else     copy cbUsername to finalCbFilename end if end tell /code/pre  All of a sudden yesterday it stopped working correctly. I had added the following code to ensure that the folder I was saving to existed.  precodetell application "System Events" if not (exists folder "~/Downloads/Conversion") then     do shell script "mkdir ~/Downloads/Conversion" end if /code/pre  Even when I comment out that code now it still doesn't work. What did I do wrong?     end tell  <answer47581> It looks like the Finder needs the absolute path to the home folder instead of the relative path. Instead of starting the path with code~//code, it needs to start with code/Users/username//code.  Instead of hardcoding the username into the script, you can have AppleScript build the absolute path on the fly:  precodeset homePath to POSIX path of (path to home folder) /code/pre  Then you can replace code"~//code with codehomePath &amp; "/code   For example:  precodeif exists "~/Downloads/Conversion/" &amp; cbUsername &amp; ".flv" as POSIX file then /code/pre  would become  precodeif exists homePath &amp; "Downloads/Conversion/" &amp; cbUsername &amp; ".flv" as POSIX file then /code/pre  Alternatively, if you only use code~/code with the path code~/Downloads/Conversion//code, you could instead change that whole path to a variable:  precodeset cbPath to POSIX path of (path to home folder) &amp; "Downloads/Conversion/" /code/pre  Then the final script would be:  precodeset cbPath to POSIX path of (path to home folder) &amp; "Downloads/Conversion/"  tell application "Finder"     if exists cbPath &amp; cbUsername &amp; ".flv" as POSIX file then         set x to 1         repeat             set newCbFilename to cbUsername &amp; "_" &amp; x as string             if exists cbPath &amp; newCbFilename &amp; ".flv" as POSIX file then                 set x to x + 1             else                 exit repeat             end if         end repeat         copy newCbFilename to finalCbFilename         display dialog "Filename already exists " &amp; "File will be named: " &amp; finalCbFilename &amp; ".flv" buttons "OK" default button "OK" with title "Error" with icon caution     else         copy cbUsername to finalCbFilename     end if end tell /code/pre  <comment54508> Alright, I'll try this. I'm just curious why it decided to stop working now is all. It worked fine up until I added the code I mentioned.
