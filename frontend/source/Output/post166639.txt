Bought music load/unload randomly on iPhone <body> Time to time I have the issue with music which I bought in iTunes Store and loaded via wifi to my iPhone 4s.  Music may randomly load or unload regardless my preferences. I can find some albums loaded in the morning, but I remember that I deleted them some days ago. And vice versa, songs may become deleted from iPhone, but these songs were loaded some time before.  What could be the reason? May it be related to iCloud backups?  <comment196002> Do you use iTunes Match ? <comment196005> No, it should be turned off on my iPhone
