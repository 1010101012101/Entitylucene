iPhone app or mod in cydia to remap headset inline remote buttons? <body> I was wondering if there's any package in Cydia or iPhone app that would allow me to change the inline remote buttons behavior. I often walk around the cydia with my headphones on and speaking the VoiceOver commands is really unconfortable.  I can normally reach my iphone from my pocket to switch up or down the volume, so I would like to use the headset buttons to skip songs.  <answer6995> In case anyone needs this too I've found that the package External iPod controls ($0.99), lets me remap my iPhone external volume buttons to change songs, so I can skip to the next song pressing the volume buttons when my iPhone is in my pocket, and I can still control the volume levels from my headset buttons.  <answer11398> activator in cydia is what you are looking for.  Complete button remapping/shortcut creator.  <comment7407> Double clicking the center button will skip to the next song in the iPod app normally, I don't know if jailbreaking would affect that.
