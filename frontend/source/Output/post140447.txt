iMessage on Mac not working when using VPN <body> iMessage stopped working properly when I use VPN on my Macbook Pro (Mavericks), making me unable to send or receive messages.  It says the user is not registered and highlighted in red/pink, but after I disconnect VPN, everything works fine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xIlzY.png" alt=""  <answer140452> Make sure strongTCP port 5223/strong is open through the VPNâ€”this port is required by iMessage.  <comment165552> depending on your needs you could just uncheck the box for "send all traffic over VPN" <comment224385> @patrix Thanks, but without knowing the VPN being used, it's impossible to explain how exactly to open the port for Bill C, and out of scope of Ask Different. <comment263223> I use [blackVPN's OpenVPN application](https://www.blackvpn.com/setup/mac-os-x/). How do I open **port 5223**? <comment263231> @Feng As mentioned, the specifics of VPN configuration are off-topic here (besides, I have no knowledge of that VPN). I suggest you look through the documentation for that specific VPN.
