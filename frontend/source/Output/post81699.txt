How can I view HTTP only cookies in OSX? <body> I have a website I'm investigating and want to view HTTP-only cookies in Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.  How can I view these special cookies in OSX?  <answer81701> The Web Developer plugin for Firefox has a "Cookies - View Cookie Information" menu choice that displays cookies for a given URL. It differentiates cookies based on http / https for each domain.  <answer81746> In Chrome choose View-Developer-Developer tools (or key alt-cmd-I) and the choose the resources tab.  In Safari Develop-Show Page Resources (key alt-cmd-A) choose the storage view. To turn the developer tools on go to Preferences-Advanced and tick the bottom box "Show Develop menu in Menu bar" For more info see the Apple documentation.
