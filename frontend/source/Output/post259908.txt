Prevent macOS from denying access to files on mounted server <body> I routinely connect to other computers on my network using codeafp/code. In most cases this works OK, and I can access files OK.  However often macOS won't let me open files e.g. code"README" canâ€™t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer/code.  I can access the files via codessh/code README shows  precode-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 54134 2016-10-27 13:28 README /code/pre  I can get at the files, by a roundabout copying process, but this is annoying. I can copy to my Mac, and edit it, but putting the modified file back is more complex.  Unfortunately I can't change the permissions, as the files are on a codeFAT/code partition (mounted on the remote machine), which doesn't support permissions.   This seems to be caused, because these files have an (inherited) execute permission (which is common on files from Windows and Linux shell scripts). I am just trying to open them in a text editor.  Is there anyway of telling macOS to allow files to be opened in my editor codeBBEdit/code  <comment325260> Does right click/Open work, even if double-click doesn't?
