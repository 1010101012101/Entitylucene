How to display tagged files inside hidden directories? <body> Keeping hidden files stronghidden/strong, how can I see content inside hidden directories using Finder tags.  I can assign a emtag/em to directory codeA/code, but it emdoes not/em show in Finder when I list all emtag/em-tagged content.  precode.hidden_directory/ ├── A │   ├── a │   │   └── 1.0 │   │       ├── bin │   │       │   └── abc ... /code/pre  Is this possible?  EDIT: I was able to successfully retrieve any content inside directories like codeDocuments/code, even if those directories have been deliberately hidden via codechflags hidden &lt;FILENAME&gt;/code.   This is not too bad, but it would be useful if I could add tags to some of the contents inside code.directories/code to quickly access them via the GUI, but without turning hidden files on.  EDIT2: This could help some people, but it's not quite exactly what I want to accomplish.  EDIT3: The first answer here also helps, but I was hoping I could use emtags/em instead of dragging a directory to the sidebar.  <answer174226> Not exactly what I was looking for, but here is a neat trick that satisfies most of my needs.  Create a new emdirectory/em, hide it via codechflags hidden directory/code, deposit tagged content in it.  Finder will cooperate with us and display all tagged content.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QXcbJ.png" alt="file is inside a hidden directory"  codefile/code is tagged codedev/code and exists in a directory hidden via codechflags/code. I named the directory codedev/code as well for convenience, but this is not strictly necessary.
