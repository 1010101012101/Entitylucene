How can I resolve this internet sharing issue? <body> I'm running PDANet on my android phone which shares internet to my el capitan macbook.  This connection works fine.  I am attempting to run internet sharing via ad hoc wifi network on the macbook to another el capitan macbook.  The wifi connection is established, but no outside networks can be reached.  However, I can access websites running on the middle machines localhost.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
