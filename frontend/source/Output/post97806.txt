Can I use my iPhone 4 sim in another iPhone 4 <body> I was just wondering if I am able to use my current iPhone 4 sim in another iPhone 4 because my current phone is breaking. Thanks  <answer97816> Yes.  But beware of locked iPhones. Some iPhones might be locked to other wireless carriers.   <comment114785> Yes you can :).
