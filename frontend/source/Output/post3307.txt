How can I get Automator to mount a network volume? <body> I am writing an Automator "script" that codersync/codes media on my 10.6.3 MacBook Pro to my Ubuntu 10.10 HTPC. I can make Automator run my shell script for codersync/code commands, but I can't make Automator mount the three volumes on the HTPC (folders for music, videos, and pictures).  I automatically mount these volumes when I login (these computers connect via a wifi network), but sometimes the HTPC volumes get unmounted, so I'd like to remount by default.  Is there a way to mount the volumes in Automator? I am open to shell scripting, too. Thanks!  <answer3308> I build automator workflows like this all the time. You only need two actions, and they're both Files &amp; Folders actions.  1) strongGet Specified Servers./strong This will let you build a list of shares to connect to. If you can map it from Finder - Go - Connect to server, you can use this.  2) strongConnect to Servers./strong This will connect to any servers passed to it (either from get specified servers or from ask for servers).  <answer3317> I use the following applescript to mount directories in conjunction with MarcoPolo so network shares are automatically mounted when I get to both my office and home.  You'll need to change USERNAME, PASSWORD, SERVER/SHARENAME and possibly smb:// depending on your server type.  precodetell application "Finder"     try         mount volume "smb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER/SHARENAME"         delay 1     end try end tell /code/pre  hr  strongUPDATE/strong: An option without MarcoPolo:  You can ping the server first and only try to connect if you get a response.  You can then add this script into your strongLogin Items/strong  (Let's say you are trying to connect to a server named "some_server")  precode-- (0) Check to see if there server exists by pinging it set max_retry to 60 set k to 0 repeat while (do shell script "ping -c 1 some_server") contains "100% packet loss"     delay 5     set k to k + 1     if k &gt; max_retry then error "Server is not responding for predefined period." number 8000 end repeat  -- (1) It exists, mount the volume tell application "Finder"     try         mount volume "smb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@some_server/SHARENAME"         delay 1     end try end tell /code/pre  <comment2997> +agreed: this is exactly how i do it in an rsync workflow I use for syncing an iTunes library.  Make sure you use Eject Volumes if you don't want the network drive to stay connected after the workflow completes. <comment2998> Eject Volumes is also handy if you want a "reverse" workflow. I use the procedure I outlined above as part of a workflow I run when I get to work (open programs, connect to servers and even remote into a virtual machine). At the end of the day, I have another one that disconnects all my servers and quits all my programs.
