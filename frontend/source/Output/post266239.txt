What are these two keys, ⇞ and ⇟? <body> I see keyboard shortcuts in the menu of Brackets. There are two symbols that look like codeup arrow/code and codedown arrow/code, could anyone tell me what they are?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B0Mrl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer266241> Those are the page-up kbd⇞/kbd and page-down kbd⇟/kbd keys (on keyboards without them, use kbdfn/kbd-Cursor up/down). For a list of other common key symbols, see this answer.  <comment333904> This is already answered, technically, in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/123568/cant-find-symbol-in-keyboard, and also appears in the help topic mentioned at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/81870/12228 (which is now called "What are those symbols shown in menus?") - though it might be nice if these were easier to search for.
