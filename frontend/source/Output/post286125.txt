Can I use Applescript to change e.g. text with red color in a range of cells in Numbers, to italic text? <body> I would like to use Applescript to change e.g. text with red color in a range of cells in a Numbers worksheet, to italic text?  This would--for example--allow me to print a Numbers worksheet on a b/w printer and still be able to pick out the text that was colored red (the red color was used by the author of the Numbers file &amp; he had a color inkjet printer available).  I just need assurance that this can be done &amp; will later figure out how to do it.  I give red as an example, but there is also text colored green.  Both colors can be present in the same cell--together with uncolored text.  I've searched the web for such assurance and haven't yet found it (I am new to Applescript).  I've used VBA with MS Excel and I recall that such a thing is possible in that case.  One complication is that not all of the text in a cell is colored red.  <comment360924> The red text should still print on a B&W printer in grayscale, so why go to the trouble!? <comment361059> I agree with @user3439894 - when you print the worksheet, red text should be discernible on the basis of its greyscale shading. Why not test this first before looking into a rather long-winded solution? Another solution *may* be to [Add conditional highlighting to cells](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH17079?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)? <comment361127> I revised the question text to mention that there is also text colored green and that red text, green text, uncolored text can all be in the same cell.
