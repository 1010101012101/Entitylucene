'the 'grub-efi-amd64-signed' package failed to install into /target/' during Linux Mint installation on an iMac <body> I have a Mid 2007 iMac, I've installed rEfind on the mac and the Linux Mint (Cinnamon 17.3) installer on an USB thumb drive .  rEfind sees the USB thumb drive, sees grub installed on the key, I boot from it and start to install Linux Mint, at a certain point I get this error: 'the 'grub-efi-amd64-signed' package failed to install into /target/'.  I manually set the partition table:br sda4 / k gb br sda5 swap 4096 mb  The iMac has a Core 2 Duo 2.0 Ghz, 3 GB RAM, and a NVDIA card.  I'll try again using the last UNebootin version, ad some different Linux distro (Xubuntu, Ubuntu, Lubuntu), but I'd like to know what issue could I have.  <answer280194> Took me weeks, but finally solved it for my case.  My install would go well, but the installation of grub would fail with the same message because of corrupted data in the EFI partition.  Fastest fix was to run a windows chkdsk to fix the partition, then the next install went fine.  <comment291039> I have a few questions. How do you put NVDIA card in an iMac? Why have you not tried using the optical drive to install? Which partition (volume) did you install rEFInd into? Did you choose 32 or 64 bit Mint? Are you trying a BIOS or EFI install? What version of OS X? Do you also have Windows or some other OS installed? Does Mint have a live version and if so, did you try boot to that first? How large was sda4? <comment291069> 1) the NVDIA is already into the iMac, it's a RadeonHD2400. 2) I didn't use the optical because I don't have a DVD to burn. 3) I just executed a script, from what I see it's in the Macintosh HD partition. 4) 64 bit Mint. 5) I guess it's an EFI, I didn't set anything about it. 6) 10.6.2 7) Yes, a 20 GB partition with Windows 7, it starts using eEFInd. 7) Yes, it has it and it works. 8) Don't remember exactly, 50-60 gb. <comment291085> I ask these questions because of my Mac. I have a 20-inch mid 2007 iMac with a 2.4 GHz processor and 4 GB of memory. I am running OS X 10.10, OS X 10.11, 64 Bit Windows 10 and FreeDos. I have rEFInd installed in a second EFI partition. I used to have 64 bit Ubuntu installed. Our machines are almost the same. I can not imagine why you are still running OS X 10.6. You do know that upgrading OS X and Windows are both free. <comment291089> Windows was installed just for games, OS X can't be upgraded because newer drivers have a bug with the graphic card: it freezes the Mac, I had to restart each time it happened (very often) <comment291090> This comment is was entered from 64 bit Mint booted in live EFI mode from a RW DVD. I do not have time right now to try an install. I could later this evening if you think this might help you. From what is see so far, the live version of Mint executes faster than Ubuntu.
