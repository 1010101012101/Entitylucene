Is there any way to partition the SSD portion of a Fusion Drive? <body> I'm looking at my next computer and am debating on whether or not to invest in a Fusion Drive. I'll be using Windows heavily on it though, and would like to take advantage of the SSD on both operating systems rather than just from within OS X.  I'm pretty technically savvy, so I wouldn't mind using Windows, Linux or another operating system to accomplish this task.  Thanks!  <answer157710> Since FusionDrive is really Corestorage with some added magic (or supposed to), there is no mandatory reason to assign the emwhole/em SSD to the Fusion drive.  When creating you DIY Fusion drive, just reserve space by creating adequate partitions and refer to the partition ID (diskXsY) instead of the whole disk.  <answer157718> In my opinion it shouldn't be a problem:  ol lidelete the codeCoreStorage LVG/code (FusionDrive) and end with 2 seperate disks: the SSD and the HDD./li liInstall codeMac OS X/code on the SSD./li liuse the codeBootcamp Camp Assistant/code to install Windows 7/8 on the SSD/li lipartition the HDD according to your needs (HFS+ &amp; NTFS/HFS+/NTFS)/li /ol  You will end with a partition layout similar to that:  precode/dev/disk0 (SSD)    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *100.2 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS MacSystem                49.6 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                     MS-DOS WinSystem                49.6 GB   disk0s4             /dev/disk1 (HDD)    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI                       209.7 MB     disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS MacData                 1,5 TB     disk1s2    3:                     MS-DOS WinData                 1,5 TB     disk1s3 /code/pre  Caveats:    ul liboth systems have to be installed on the size restricted SSD  /li lithe codedata partition/code i/o won't benefit from the SSD/li /ul  There is no way that both systems will benefit from a FusionDrive in the sense of fast I/O strongand/strong size.  <answer157766> Fusion Drive technology is part of the Mac OS itself. Windows cannot use it.  It can, of course see the Core Storage Drive &amp; its NTFS partition &amp; boot from it, but it cannot use the hybrid technology underlying 'Fusion' itself.  Bootcamp will make the NTFS partition purely on the HD.  btw, Bootcamp is the strongonly/strong way to add the extra partition to a Fusion Drive. Anything else will break it, requiring you to totally rebuild the structure from scratch using Terminal.br Disk Utility cannot remake or properly readjust a Core Storage Volume.br Don't touch the partition itself from inside Windows.  <answer210638> Yes. Note that the fusion Drive is a HD drive with a small SSD apart (look for replace fusion drive), running in RAID   Will ned to run the Mac OS in a SD card or flash drive.  ol liDiscover the IDENTIFIER of each one on terminal type: codediskutil list/code/li liErase (format) each one in my case (disk0 and disk1), I was using a SD card as my HD (I installed the OS in a SD card), you can not make that running the Mac from it's internal fusion drive. In terminal:  precodediskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ HD disk1 /code/pre  and   precodediskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ SSD disk0 /code/pre/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNmjF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now you can use Disk Utility to rename, create partition, etc  (I figured it out 'damaging' my fusion drive trying to partition it)  <comment185468> I was planning on ordering the official Fusion Drive configuration provided by Apple. Is there a way to shrink the SSD partition after I take it out of the box? <comment185469> This would do away with the benefits of Fusion Drive. Is there a way to recreate OS X's one logical Fusion Drive partition after doing this? <comment185471> @ChrisLong creating a fusion drive with disk0s2 and disk1s2 (assuming disk0s1/disk1s1 are EFI partitions and disk0s3 and disk1s3 are Win-DOS)? NO <comment185476> Please add some information how to accomplish that. <comment263948> Can you please explain what you mean with "damaging" your fusion drive?
