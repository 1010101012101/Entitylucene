Security & Privacy issue: cannot edit options <body> I am trying to set password when active the screen saves. This option is in Security &amp; Privacy - Require Password checkbox.  The problem is that this checkbox is gray - read only access - even if I unlock this in padlock. I am also using the administrator user.  How solve it? Is there any Terminal command to add the password?  I am using macOS Sierra 10.12.3.  <answer271084> Go to System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General:  Select the option "Require password" and set "immediately" on the box with the options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hp84D.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment340729> In order to activate the box you have to click on the lock button. It will require your password and you can now make changes. <comment340948> I said that it still gray even with this unlock. <comment341120> So  your Mac's Shit
