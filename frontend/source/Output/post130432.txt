Change Default Table Style when opening a CSV file <body> h3Background/h3  I often open a CSV file on strongNumbers/strong, and then I see the table of which style is 'Basic'.  I want to use another style (e.g. 'Gray'), but it's annoying to change the style every time I open a file.  h3Question/h3  Can I change the default table style which Numbers uses when a file is opened?  <answer135904> I'm not aware of the possibility of changing the default, but a useful workflow is:   ul liset up the doc with the exactly the styles you need, /li li'Save as template' to the template chooser,/li liopen Numbers/li linew doc with your new template/li lidrag the CSV onto the table/li /ul  Actually pretty quick to execute (after initial template configuration) and very flexible (allows different styles for different purposes). In combination Launchbar (etc), this is pretty seamless and doesn't involve any messing about with positioning windows, etc.  <comment161483> It seems pretty good workaround. thank you.
