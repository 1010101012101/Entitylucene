How to unlock my Mac in iCloud? <body> I don't know how this happened but my Mac was locked; now when I go to strongiCloud - Find my Mac/strong I found my Mac with locked status.br The problem that I don't know the pin code to unlock it.  Is there any way to unlock it remotely from the iCloud account or using trick to remove the lock.  So each time I start my Mac, it tell me to wait 60min before trying again, one count down reach zero I get :     incorrect code, please try again   Instead of getting the input pin screen  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JlNWw.jpg" alt="error screen"  <comment254738> Call Apple support. <comment254740> They will ask for purchase proof which I don't have. <comment254741> If the Mac is associated with your Apple ID, and you can prove that it's your Apple ID then you should be fine. <comment254742> Yeah it's associated with my Appel ID (iCloud account ) but how to prove that ID is my id <comment254743> [Apple ID Temporary Support PIN](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202650) <comment254894> @ecnepsnai Please check my update, also the EFI is locked and I'had never set lock on it this the first time open the EFI but it's protected with password
