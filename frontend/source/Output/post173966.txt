XCode debug error Thread 1 <body> Ok so I'm trying to work with swift on XCode but every time I start to run my code I get this   codeThread 1 Queue: com.apple.main-thread(serial)/code  What does this mean?, and how do I fix it? Also i've started a new project with the same code to make sure theres no unnecessary code mistakes. However I still get the same error.  <answer173981> What you describe as an error, it's not. That is the main queue where the program runs. You will see that queue every time you run a program.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CquXl.png" alt="enter image description here"
