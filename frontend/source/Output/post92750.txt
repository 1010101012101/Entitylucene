Checkerboard pattern in iTunes videos <body> While watching iTunes-purchased video content (TV/movies), I periodically see a quick flash of the gray/white DRM checkerboard that iTunes shows when you're trying to watch video while screen-sharing.  The gist:  ul liMac mini Mid-2012 (10.8.3) with locally-stored iTunes library/li liScreen sharing is enabled, but emnot/em active when this occurs/li liSometimes it's a flicker about one frame in duration/li liSometimes mid-video the checkerboard appears and stays. ul liWhen this occurs, scrubbing the video back some fixes it./li /ul/li liIt never seems to happen in the same location in a video twice./li /ul  I would, of course, appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to keep this from happening. It's really quite jarring.  <answer95248> I have the same behavior. If you turn off the Screen Sharing service in System Preferences  Sharing, it will cure the issue. Turning it back on will again present the intermittent flashes of CPHD checkerboard during playback. Must be a bug - gonna call AppleCare and get them to file a bug report.  <comment114073> Yep, this fixes it. A shame. I'm glad there's a way to remotely enable/disable Screen Sharing in case I leave it off and need to control the machine.
