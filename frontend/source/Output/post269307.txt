Finder window background colour or image for USB Drive <body> I would like to know how to add an image (if that's not possible then a colour) to the Finder window of my USB stick - just the stick not every window.br I have seen it on various .DMG installers (the ones which require the app to be moved into the applications folder often have an image with an arrow and a text telling the user to drag and drop) and now wonder how this is done for the window of a USB drive.  I have an application which runs straight from the stick itself without wanting to move it to the apps directory of the Mac. Every time I click on the USB drive I would like to see a custom image background (much like on those DMGs).  Search results returned old and obsolete ways or partial answers no longer supported by macOS Sierra.  <answer269308> Only works in icon view &amp; as far as I'm aware only on HFS drives.br I quickly tested with a FAT32 drive which appeared to work, but didn't survive eject/insert]  ul liOpen your folder or entire disk &amp; set view to Icon [kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd 1 /kbd ]/li liShow view options [right click or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd J /kbd ]/li liSelect Colour or Picture [for picture you then drag &amp; drop an image to the box on the panel./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mi9wA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment338304> Is there a way to force icon view for the drive? Would it be able to override the mac's existing settings? <comment338307> It's right there on the same info panel, first line. <comment338427> I see. You have been very helpful. Lastly, is there a way to have the window size fitted to the image? <comment338440> Not as far as I'm aware.
