Can Apple Mail be optimized to perform well when I have 30k messages in my inboxes? <body> I have about 31,300 emails in 4 different inboxes in Mail. Sadly to say, it is extremely slow.  Is there any tips or trips to optimize Mail?  And no, I don't want to delete any, I need them for work.  <answer66725> The easiest thing to do is clean up the index file Mail uses to track the messages:  precode  sqlite3 ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Envelope\ Index vacuum; /code/pre  Thanks for this tip to the estimable Brett Terpstra. The linked article explains how to make an AppleScript file to measure things before and after to see if the operation thinned out the size of the file Mail uses to store the pointers to the messages. I would add, quit Mail and make a backup before trying to clean the file. A codevacuum/code operation is normally harmless, but why not get a backup just in case.  Also, this thread probably goes back to @bbum and his weblog-o-mat and perhaps even deeper back...  <answer76052> For me the sqlite3 vacuum didn't speed Mail.app back up.  The thing that returned my Mail.app to blazing fast speeds was deleting the mail sandbox folder.  ol liQuit Mail.app/li liDelete the folder code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/code (use coderm -r ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/code from Terminal, or in Finder press kbdCmd-Shift-G/kbd, enter code~/Library/Containers/code then find the codecom.apple.mail folder/code and drag to trash and empty trash)/li liRelaunch Mail.app/li /ol  Source: https://discussions.apple.com/message/20662231#20662231  <comment78584> What kind of hard drive do you use? <comment78602> Uh, whatever is in my 24" iMac. <comment78603> Nice one! Thanks! <comment95639> Great! The only disadvantage for me was the reset of the Mail.app UI. The speed is incredible now. <comment96533> Joshua- Awesome! That was driving me crazy and mail is running blazing fast again. Thanks.
