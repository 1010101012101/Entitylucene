Can I block incoming calls using wildcard patterns? <body> Recently I have been getting a few unwanted telemarketing calls, all coming from the same source. Each number though is different at the end.  For instance, if the numbers to be blocked are:   ul li123-4567/li li123-7642/li li123-8643/li /ul  It would be convenient for the future to simply block with a wildcard, such as:  ul li123-*/li /ul  Is this at all possible?  <answer199454> To my knowledge, there is no way of blocking phone numbers with wildcard patterns. However, you can try telling them to take you off their list, if you're lucky, all of them should stop calling if they're from the same company.  This is usually how I deal with telemarketers.  ol liavoid entering your phone number online wherever possible/li liif a telemarketer calls, pick up the phone and ask them to take you off their list, they are legally required by the FCC to do so./li liif they continue calling after you have told them to take you off their list, file a report with the FCC/li /ol  <answer253155> There is now an API for applications to block and annotate incoming calls. There isn't a native interface so you would need to find an app that does this on the App Store or find an open source project and compile it in Xcode and use your AppleID to install the app onto your personal devices.  One review covering this category is:  ul lihttp://www.macworld.com/article/3119736/ios/new-call-blocking-apps-in-ios-10-can-stop-spams-and-scams-before-they-reach-you.html/li /ul  <answer264776> WideProtect is a pretty simple app for exactly this purpose https://itunes.apple.com/app/wideprotect/id1171024059  <answer294596> Try strongBlacklist/strong and strongBlacklist Pro/strong by Sergey Smirnov, and strongAd &amp; Call Blocker 2 in 1/strong by Codefavor. strongBlacklist/strong (free) allows one range of numbers. strongBlacklist Pro/strong ($1.99) allows multiple ranges of numbers. strongAd &amp; Call Blocker 2 in 1/strong is 1.99.  <comment226315> I do not believe this is possible with iOS 8 but it would be a welcome feature. Hopefully someone can suggest a service or mobile phone provider who offers this at the network level.
