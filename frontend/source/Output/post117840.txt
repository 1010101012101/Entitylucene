Epson Stylus Color Photo R200 won't print <body> I have a Mac Mini (late 2012) with Mavericks installed. It is connected via USB to an Epson Stylus Color Photo R200 inkjet printer.   When I print, the print job window says  precodeStopped - Unsupported colorspace = -1, 2 pages /code/pre  I have run Software Update.  This is the first time I have tried to use the printer, normally it connects to my old PC and works fine.  <answer117841> A new print driver for this printer was made available for Mavericks in September of '13. Have you downloaded and tried this new driver? I had to update the driver for a Epson Stylus Color Photo R300 for a client of mine to make it work on Mavericks.  <comment137566> Yep I tried this.  The page just tells you to run Software Update and when I do, it says no updates are available.
