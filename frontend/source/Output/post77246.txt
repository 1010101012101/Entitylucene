Display PowerPoint notes on iPhone during presentation? <body> When presenting a PowerPoint (.pptx) document, I'll likely have a clicker but cannot count on having visible access to the notes I've written inside it for each slide to help me present.  The presentation will be running on a Windows machine.  Is there an app for the iPhone where I can not only open the PowerPoint document, but easily read the notes only, slide-by-slide?  Alternatively, what solutions do you suggest? Google Docs?  <answer84730> Have you taken a look at Slideshow Remote? http://www.slideshowremote.com/  This is a well-regarded app (with both free and pro versions) that can remotely control PowerPoint on a PC and allow you to view and edit the presenter's notes.  <comment89565> The best imho is: Keynote + Keynote Remote. But it requires a Mac. <comment89576> Right, but the "presentation will be running on a Windows machine" â€” nothing can do about that. <comment97692> Holy smokes, that's just it! **Thank you!**
