How do I delete a specific cookie by name in Safari? <body> I opted into an experimental new Stack feature (coming soonish!), and now I want to opt back out. To do so, all I have to do is delete a cookie called codepurple/code. It should be easy. Just go to Safari preferences, privacy, cookie details, and...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2skkc.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...hum.  I don't want to delete all of my Stack Exchange cookies, just the one I know the name of. Can I delete this cookie through Safari? If not, where do Safari's cookies live, so I can delete it by hand?  <answer176104> You can still see individual cookies using Safari in developer mode.  Go to strong"Safari--Preferences--Advanced"/strong and enable strong"Show Develop menu in menu bar"/strong.  Navigate to the webpage that holds the cookie you are looking to remove.  Go to strongDevelop/strong in the menu bar and "strongShow web inspector/strong".  On the left hand side there will be a folder "Cookies" that holds the data from that site.  You can right click them and delete certain ones.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4K6N5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer233590> This works, from 2012, but I just tried it -   http://osxdaily.com/2012/06/10/delete-site-specific-cookies-ios/  <comment289166> The *Details* button seems to have been removed from recent version(s) of Safari. I'm running Version 9.1 (11601.5.17.1) on El Capitan. <comment353305> The question refers to MacOS/OS X, not IOS.  Although it didn't say so in text, the screen shot makes it obvious. <comment353306> What if you don't know what web page, only the domain? <comment359069> On the current latest version of macOS Safari (10.1.1), cookies can now be found under the Storage tab.
