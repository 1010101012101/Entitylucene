Is there a way to refresh a file that is opened by TextEdit? <body> As an academic, I often have to conduct "numerical experiments" by running a small computer program that outputs to a text file. I use TextEdit to read the text file. However, when I re-run the program, and the contents of the text file changes, I find that the contents in TextEdit do not automatically update to the new version. In order to access the new version, I need to close the existing TextEdit window, and open the file again in TextEdit.  Is there a way to refresh the file to the new version in TextEdit? For those of you who know about the program Vim, what I am looking for is like the command code:e[dit]/code in Vim which allows one to     Edit the current file. This is useful to re-edit the current file, when it has been changed outside of Vim.   <answer115140> There's a emugly/em way of doing it, as far as I know.   Once the file has been edited just try to save it. TextEdit will prompt you saying something like:     The document "Untitled.txt" couldn't be saved. Other application modified the file.   Giving you the choice to either strongRestore/strong or strongSave anyway/strong.   While strongSave anyway/strong will keep your changes strongand/strong save as a new version the emchanges/em made by the other application, strongRestore/strong will emupdate/em your file with these new changes.   Unless there's a specific reason to use emTextEdit/em I'd recommend using any other text editor, such as TextMate, which supports the automatic refresh.   <comment134766> I do not use TextEdit, but BBEdit will definitely update when edited elsewhere. <comment134877> Thank you for your comment. I decided to try TextWrangler (the free version of BBEdit) and it also auto-refreshes. <comment313941> TextMate is a gem.
