Manually force sync on AppleRAID 1 <body> I'd like to force a sync or repair on my AppleRAID set as part of a regular maintence. Under Linux (md) I can do this by writing to control devices. Diskutil does not seem to offer me such an option.  <answer133329> Open Disk Utility, select the RAID set and then click on RAID. Then click on Rebuild.  <comment157984> I don't see this unless the array degrades.
