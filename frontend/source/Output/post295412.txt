iTerm2: Difference between preloaded Light and Dark themes <body> I can't seem to spot the difference between the preloaded two themes: Light and Dark. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VT39J.png" alt="enter image description here"  Background: I was looking for a theme that "inverts" the default color scheme, i.e. dark text and light background, but neither seem to achieve this.  Could someone en-light-en me? (Pun intended.)  <answer295415> That toggle is under the tabs section; it changes the theme of the tab bar, not the actual terminal view itself. To change the terminal theme, choose the Profiles tab, select a profile and edit the colours as you wish.  <comment372996> Great! I was able to choose Light Background in the color presets under Profiles.
