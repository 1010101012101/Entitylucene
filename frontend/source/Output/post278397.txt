Non-Apple SSD blade in iMac 21.5" Late 2013 PCIe slot? <body> I've made a low-cost SSD upgrade to a MacBook Air 11" Mid 2012 (MD224) from 128 GB factory default to 500 GB Samsung 850 Evo M.2 NGFF SSD, using this cheap M.2 NGFF SSD to 18+8pin SSD Adapter. Works like charm and much, much cheaper than a genuine Apple SSD module.  I'm trying to figure out if thereâ€™s such a low-cost SSD upgrade path using the PCIe slot in an iMac 21.5" Late 2013 (EMC 2638; Model ID iMac14,3) as well. I'm aware of the option the replace the 2.5" HDD with an 2.5" SSD, but I'd like to keep the internal 1TB HDD and add a 500 GB SSD blade module to the PCIe slot. Unfortunately the genuine ones from Apple are totally overpriced.  Anyone knows of a low-cost adapter for using generic SSD blades in the said iMac, such as the above Samsung Evo 850 M.2 SSD?
