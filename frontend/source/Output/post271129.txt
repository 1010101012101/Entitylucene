I have a new Apple ID, my original email account has been deleted. I am unable to change my icloud address <body> After closing my original Apple ID email account, I am unable to change my email address on icloud. There is no option to edit.  <comment340789> What exactly are you trying to do?  If you close an account you can't edit the info anymore.  Was your original goal to change the email address associated with your Apple ID?
