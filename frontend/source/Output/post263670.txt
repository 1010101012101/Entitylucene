US software update for non-US iPhone <body> My friend has an iPhone (6 or SE, not sure) that is locked to a Japan provider. The phone received an OTA update (alternatively could have been via iTunes) in the US and now using a Japanese SIM card yields a "invalid SIM card" message. Any ideas on the root cause or how to roll back/fix?  Thanks!  <comment330359> Can your friend restore from a previous backup? <comment330383> Not sure if one exists or not, but will check - thanks!
