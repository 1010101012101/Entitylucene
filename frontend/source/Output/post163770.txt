Mac OS X Lion Installation Issues With Bootcamped Windows 8 Installation <body> I'm trying to install Windows 8 on my Mac (10.7.5) but I'm running into some big issues.

Basically Bootcamp assistant converted the disk from a legal GPT disk into a hybrid MBR disk, which OS X sees as GPT and Windows sees as MBR. The solution in this case is to clear the hybrid MBR data. Check the link to look how to do it.  <comment191784> Which Mac, which Bootcamp? Win 8 can only be installed with Bootcamp 5 & newer Macs. <comment191786> Edited the first message with the specs. I already did installed windows 8 on this mac but the problem was that it only rebooted with my external hard disk connected to it. After that it did not booted again so I had to delete it all.
