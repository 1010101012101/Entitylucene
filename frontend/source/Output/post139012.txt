Retina version have two thunderbolt ports that you can use simultaneously to two external displays along with MacBook's LCD panel.  There are also USB cables which comes with internal display card attached, so it will not have the same speed the MacBook's integrated display card, but if it is compatible with your OS version, should work without any issues.
