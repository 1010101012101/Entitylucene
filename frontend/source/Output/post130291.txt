Remove a single event from Calendar subscription <body> I am subscribed to Apple's holiday calendar, which is very useful. However, some holidays are not of interest for me - is there a way to delete selected events manually while keeping the rest of the subscription?  <answer130292> No â€” subscribing to a calendar will add all the events to your calendar and it is not possible to hide any of them, just all of them by hiding the entire calendar.  <answer174948> It is actually possible to download the subscription and then delete some events:  In the calendar app, right-click on the holiday calendar subscription and then "copy URL to clipboard". Paste this into a web browser, download the .ics file, double-click and finally we are there: All holidays for the next 10 years are imported, and all of the unwanted events can be deleted manually.  <comment152678> I hoped that there was a way to download the entire list of the subscription and then delete some events out of it or something like that. <comment248223> This is quite possibly the dumbest decision in the history of the universe; not deciding that this is a useful feature. I cry myself to sleep every night over this.
