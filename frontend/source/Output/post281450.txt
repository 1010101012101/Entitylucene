ITerm2 goes into vim mode unexpectedly <body> My codealt+right/code and codealt+left/code keys are mapped to codeEsc+b/code and codeEsc+f/code respectively, and they work properly for moving back and forward one word at a time. I verified this by checking the output of those keybindings using code$ sed -l/code  However, as soon as I use either of those keys, I lose most of my editing functionality. I'm unable to:   * delete characters with backspace   * insert spaces with the spacebar Things I can still do:   * use the arrow keys to move   * type some characters  After some playing around, it seems like my keybinding are entering vim keybindings mode! I can move around with codeh/code, codej/code, codek/code, and codel/code. And I've found that codec/code seems to release me from the mode to edit normally again.  I've also read this FAQ: Q: Why my arrow/HOME/END keys are not working?. The terminal type in my settings matches the session env code$TERM/code, both are codexterm-256color/code.  Also, I've looked at the normal terminal behaviour, it doesn't have this issue, but codesed -l/code shows the same escape sequences.
