How to auto-create mount points in /Volume with sshfs <body> I believe the title says it all, but anyways: I would like to recreate the OSX behaviour of auto-creating mount points in /Volumes with sshfs mounting remote folders and auto-deleting these mount points. I prefer this to have mount target folders hanging around with no other sense then waiting to get something mounted on it. ;) Is there a way to achieve this with sshfs?  <answer65736> The MacFusion Menuling will do that for you if you're willing to use a GUI. The menuling is a little crashy on Mountain Lion, but you may be able to fix that since the source is on Github.  <comment77361> tried it, and don't have time to fix it. ;) It really disconnects by crash every 3 minutes. <comment77410> Let's use the ssh tag for now - search does a great job of letting us find sshfs and we are working to keep tags broad enough for people to want to follow them. <comment125851> Did you record any progress on that? It looks like one should use the latest [FUSE for OS X](http://osxfuse.github.io/), setup key authentication and then add a line to `/etc/fstab`, however I keep getting Permission denied errors from the server, it looks like the key is ignored (although I can `ssh` with the key).
