Where are updated Apple security guidelines for recent OS X versions? <body> Pardon my paranoia; but with an 80,000-strong[#] global work force, one would think the need to cover important security guidelines for users would easily be met with each new OS X release. Yet a glance at apple's security page reveals that the last update was for 10.6 Snow Leopard, a long, long time ago for internet age.   So where are the security config guide updates for Lion, Mountain Lion &amp; Mavericks?  <comment133008> Please keep the question focused on the thing you are looking for (security config guides for recent OS X releases). <comment133023> This isn't a duplicate, but an upgrade. At the time of Lion inception, and at that time Internet aggressivness the lack was large. Now we are many years later and many major OS X versions away in outer space without the usual relevant documentation. <comment133025> See this related question at the time of Lion: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/48853/22003 .
