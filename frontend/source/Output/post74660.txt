Can you charge an iPhone 5 from a standard, non-Apple Micro USB cable? <body> Someone who has the new iPhone 5 said you can charge it from a regular Micro USB port but he's not tested it.  Can you?  <answer74664> Yes - just get a simple pass through adapter to plug the male USB into an adapter that fits in the lightning slot.  ul lihttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MD820ZM/A/lightning-to-micro-usb-adapter/li /ul  There are also knock off and legitimate third party adapters being sold, so you can pick your price point / fit and finish / support sweet spot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6zn4T.png" alt="Apple micro USB to Lightning adapter"  <answer75163> Just to confirm what bmike said: I have one of Apple's micro-USB-to-Lightning adapters, and am using it with the cable from an Amazon Kindle. The combination works flawlessly on both the charging and data-synchronization fronts.  <answer89392> Too scared to try as Verizon Wireless said it will fry your Iphone 5  <answer134724> Just tried with Amazon Kindle cable. iPhone charger, Kindle Cable, Apple adapter, iPhone 5s. No luck though. iPhone says: not a certified cable, might not work flawlessly.  it does not charge. :(  <comment104913> Hmm - perhaps some other qualifier was present in the conversation? [USB is 5.0 V DC at 500-900mA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB) unless the device request a larger charging current. Since the iPhone 5 also charges from the same USB ports (albeit with different cable) it seems odd to presume this would fry anything.
