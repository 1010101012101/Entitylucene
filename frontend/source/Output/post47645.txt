Show and hide podcast art on iOS 5 <body> As standard In the list of podcast episodes for a specific podcast in the music app, down the left hand side you can see a small preview of the cover image for the podcast.  Somehow I've managed to hide this, most likely some gesture on that screen I accidentally made while deleting an episode.  Does anyone know what you do to hide / unhide the podcast art?
