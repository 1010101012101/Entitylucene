External hard drive not recognised and not shutting down normally - after upgrade to Sierra <body> I have a MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) which I've just upgraded to OS X Sierra.  I've noticed 2 problems, which are possibly un-related, and I'm unsure if they're to do with the OS upgrade or not.  ol liI use an external USB hard drive (Seagate SRD00F1) with Time Machine. I connected the drive and began making a backup with Time Machine, however the whole computer froze half way through. I unplugged the hard drive from the USB port and the computer became responsive again. I've restarted my Mac - including resetting the PRAM - and the drive doesn't show up in Finder or the Disk Utility. Effectively the drive cannot be seen by the Mac at all. The drive is "on" in the sense that it is spinning and has a light on it when connected. The drive does not have an external power supply./li liWhen I shut down my Mac it goes to a black screen. The "under keyboard lighting" (no idea what this is called!) remains on. The keyboard doesn't do anything, e.g. if I press the Caps key the green light doesn't come on. The only way to shut down the Mac is by holding the power button down for around 10 seconds./li /ol  I'm experiencing this regardless of whether the Mac is connected to an external power supply or running on battery.  Any advice appreciated.  I've had the computer for around 1 year and it's worked flawlessly up to now. Both of these problems have been noted today after upgrading to Sierra but I'm not convinced they are software related.
