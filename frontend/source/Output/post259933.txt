XCode 8 keeps hanging <body> Since I've updated to Sierra and started using XCode 8, XCode started freezing a lot, specially (but not only) when saving. The beachball appears and nothing can be done in XCode. Sometimes it freezes for some seconds and resumes, other times it won't resume (or at least, not in a reasonable time).  Already tried XCode 8.1 and 8.2. Same problem.  Is there any fix? Or anyway to troubleshoot this (like logs and such).   <answer278174> ol liClose Xcode/li liOpen Terminal/li liType defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode/li liRe-open Xcode/li /ol  strongNote:/strong Xcode will be reset to its default settings. This might help if you would like to do so.  <comment325301> What errors are you receiving?  It's very difficult to troubleshoot the problem or offer a fix when we don't even know the problem. <comment325332> No errors. That's why I asked for a way to troubleshoot, like logs. Console shows nothing related with xcode. <comment325860> Could you try updating to Xcode 8.1? <comment325968> Already tried 8.1 and 8.2 Beta.
