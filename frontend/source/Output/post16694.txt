I can't trash files anymore, but only delete them directly <body> When I want to delete a file in Finder or in the Desktop a popup appears and it says it will be deleted immediately, and I need to confirm.  The trash is always empty, and I can't use it anymore.   What's going on with the mac !? (I'm on Snow Leopard)  thanks  <answer16695> Check the ownership and permissions on code~/.Trash/code.  precodemress:10039 Z$ ls -ld ~/.Trash  drwx------  285 allbery  staff  9690 Jun 28 16:53 /Users/allbery/.Trash/ /code/pre  My guess is it somehow ended up being owned by coderoot/code, but there are other possibilities.  If it's the owner, the fix is codesudo chown $USER ~/.Trash ~/.Trash/.DS_Store/code.  <comment18244> It is indeed: drwx------  3 root  staff  102 Jun 27 08:52 /Users/aneuryzma/.Trash <comment18245> @geekosaur Should I change the permissions to 777 ? <comment18267> `sudo chown $USER ~/.Trash ~/.Trash/.DS_Store` is all you should need to do. <comment18289> @geekosaur I get this: chown: /Users/Patrick/.Trash/.DS_Store: No such file or directory <comment18290> That's harmless; the file will only exist if the Finder wanted to store extra information about the Trash itself. <comment18295> @geekosaur ok cool, thanks
