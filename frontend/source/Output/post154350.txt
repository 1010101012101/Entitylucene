Menu command name for adjusting brightness <body> I'm trying to change the Increase brightness key from kbdF1/kbd to kbdF7/kbd.  In order to do that, I went to codeSystem Preferences/code and tried to make a custom shortcut, but I realized that I didn't know the menu command name for adjusting brightness, if it exists at all.  I tried "Increase Brightness," "Brightness Up," "Increase Display Brightness," all that stuff but none of them worked.  Any help?  <answer154365> Apple hasn't made this easy (or if they have, I've missed it).  The only way that I know to do this is with Keyboard Maestro.   You may need to disable the iTunes media keys on your Mac keyboard:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist /code/pre  And then you can use Keyboard Maestroâ€™s emDevice Key/em option (for some reason the "Hot Key" didn't work.) Press the key that you want to use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3riWy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment181656> Bummer. If Keyboard Maestro can do it, surely there must be a way to do it manually. (And I gotta say, paying $36 doesn't seem too fun either) <comment181836> There are a ton of things that Keyboard Maestro can be do, and usually do easier than other ways. It's one of the first apps that I install after setting up a new Mac. Well worth the price.
