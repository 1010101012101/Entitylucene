Use Fn Keys, but keep Playback Keys <body> I'm a programmer, so it'd be useful for me to have access to codeF1/code, codeF2/code, etc.  while working on my laptop (a 2013 Macbook Air).  That said, I'm not really willing to give up the music or volume control keys.   Is there a way to bind codeF7-F11/code to their respective OS X specific features?   <answer181290> If you just flip the function?  Enable F keys.  Now use fn + Volume keys.  <answer181496> Install KeyRemap4MacBook (for Mac OS X 10.4-10.8) or Karabiner (for Mac OS X 10.9-10.10).  After the install is completed open KeyRemap4MacBook/Karabiner - Preferences and the tab Change Key.  Scroll to "Change F1...F19 Key &amp; Functional Key..." and enable the settings you want. The modified settings might conflict with keyboard shortcuts activated in the System Preferences. There are already a lot pre-sets but you may also create a custom set with a private.xml.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3TWV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment215912> Thank you! I already have Karabiner, and I absolutely love it.  It's a fantastic piece of software.  Do you know a good resource to learn to write my own private.xml file? <comment215928> @Brandon The only one I know of is the linked [reference manual](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/xml.html.en).
