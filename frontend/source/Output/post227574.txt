Where does skype store downloads? <body> After downloading an attachment in skype, which is saved to my ~/Downloads folder, the attachment won't show up in de Downloads-folder until I click the 'eye' or 'magnifying glass' icons overlaying the download in the skype-message window.  Even when listing the files in the Downloads-folder in terminal, the skype downloads won't show up.  Where are the files downloaded in a skype message stored, until I click one of the two 'Reveal in finder'-icons (resolved in update 1)  strongQuestion/strong: Is there a setting/possibility, to automatically make the attachements show up in the Downloads-folder without having to click on them aftet the download is completed?  strongUPDATE 1/strong: The files seem to be located in code/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Caches/com.skype.skype/fsCachedData/code  strongUPDATE 2/strong: I tried writing an automator script, which watches the above folder for new files, automatically renames them to their original names and moves them to ~/Downloads, but I don't know where the original names are stored. I tried to just change the extension of the files which also failed, as automator only differentiates between file-types, but not different extensions  <answer229639> To answer the title of my question  The files are located in code/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Caches/com.skype.skype/fsCachedData/code  If someone knows how to get them out of there automatically, I would still like to know  <answer250232> Seems like a bug, but after you download the file, I have to click on the magnifying glass (on mouse over) aka "Reveal in Finder" in order for the file to literally "reveal" itself in my downloads folder. If I do not click the icon, the file is not in downloads.  <comment278251> If update 1 solves your problem, you should [add it as an answer yourself and accept it](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer). If not, could you please rewrite the question to emphasize that you're looking for a configuration setting in Skype? <comment278312> @Gaurav I would kike to have the attachement show up in the Download folder after the download it completed, without having to click a second time on the file. With big/multiple downloads I would have to scroll to find it to clikc on it, if I've written enough in that conversation to make it leave the visible part of the conversation. <comment310643> The whole question was about not having to click on that magnifying glass â€¦
