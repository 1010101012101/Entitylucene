How to set Photoshop CC window size to 1280x720 via AppleScript? <body> I'm trying to resize the Photosshop CC window to 1280x720 to record it in 720p. I tried multiple ways, including AppleScript, SizeUP! app, terminal etc but none work.  Here's an example of AppleScript I'm using:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell application process "Adobe Photoshop CC"      display dialog (get name of window 1)      set position of window 1 to {50, 50}        set size of window 1 to {1280, 720}  end tell /code/pre  It does set the position, but does not set the size of the application window.  When I try  precodetell application "System Events" to tell application process "Adobe Photoshop CC"            tell window 1             set {size, position} to {{1280, 720}, {150, 150}}             end tell end tell /code/pre  I get the error code"System Events got an error: Can’t set application process \"Adobe Photoshop CC\" to {1280, 720}." number -10006 from application process "Adobe Photoshop CC"/code  I have also tried to set bounds instead of size with the following code to no avail.  precodeset the_application to "/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CC/Adobe Photoshop CC.app" tell application the_application     activate     set bounds of window 1 to {1, 1, 1281, 721} end tell /code/pre  and I get code"Adobe Photoshop CC got an error: Can’t set window 1 to {1, 1, 1281, 721}." number -10006 from window 1/code  SizeUP! app does change the position but does not effect the Photoshop window size.  Does anyone know how can I resize the Photoshop application window on a Mac to 1280x720 to record it in 720p?  Thanks!  <answer219840> I cannot replicate your problem as I don't own Adobe Photoshop, but it seems extremely likely that the process you're trying to tell s.th. to is emNOT/em named em"Adobe Photoshop CC"/em.br (Did happen to me once, too ...)  My guess is supported by the fact that I could emexactly/em reproduce your error messages by using "Safari" as placeholder but mis-spelling it "SafariX" in the script.br Try this command in Script-Editor (with Photoshop running) to find out:  precodetell application "System Events" to get processes whose ¬ name starts with "ph" /code/pre  <comment135930> Welcome to Ask Different!
