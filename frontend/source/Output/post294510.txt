Mac Pro 5.1 Windows 10 EFI Boot (Separate Drive) <body> I've installed Windows 10 EFI with this Tutorial and it worked fine. But when switching from Windows to OSX using the Bootcamp "Boot to OSX..." it just rebooted into Windows again. Then I unplugged the Windows drive and it booted into OSX, but now if I choose "Windows" from System Preferences-Startup Disk it just reboots to OSX.  Is the only way of switching OS in this configuration by using a helper card and pressing alt on boot?  My current setup:  ul liMac Pro 4.1 (flashed to 5.1) /li li2,66 Quad Xeon/li liRX480 graphics card/li liBay 1 OSX SSD Drive/li li2nd Optical Bay Windows SSD Drive/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1aDl2.png" alt="diskutil list"
