Unwanted Safari cookies that can't be deleted? <body> I have Safari set to "Allow [cookies] from current website only."  Yet the list shows domains I have never been to or heard of.  Some of them, when I select them and click remove, sometimes nothing happens and sometimes they disappear only to reappear within a few seconds.  In an effort to resolve this, I exited Safari and used sudo to ensure that I owned¹ and had write permissions to everything in my user account.  Relaunch Safari; still a problem.  With strongno/strong browser windows open, cookies from google, chron.com, gizmodo, and umn.edu (among others) show this problem.  The google cookies stopped coming back after maybe a dozen deletions.  I don't want to delete plists that contain "good" cookies, therefore this is not a duplicate of the three or four posts that want to delete all.  It is almost a duplicate of a couple of others, but their answers depend on Safari features that no longer exist.  ¹Mysteriously, the admin account owned some of the .JPG files in my Photos library.
