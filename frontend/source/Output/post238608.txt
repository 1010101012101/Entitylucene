Relative paths work fine.  If what you're trying to do here is create a symlink from Dropbox to BTsync, the problem is that Dropbox already exists. This means the symlink is created eminside/em the Dropbox folder, named BTSync. Delete Dropbox and try again.  If you really meant to create a symlink inside the Dropbox folder, then both these commands work identically.  <comment292702> @Masi You want BTsync to be a symlink **to** Dropbox? Then you've got your arguments the wrong way round. Check the link in my answer for the basics of symlinking. <comment292704> @Masi Please edit your question back to avoid confusion. I tried both commands in 10.11.4 and they work identically. Are you getting an error? What doesn't work? <comment292709> Please, see the body for the proofs.
