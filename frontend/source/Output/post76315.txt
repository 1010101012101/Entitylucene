On find my iphone, if my 'pending: Lock Mac' is not there, does that mean it has been locked? <body> My mac was stolen and I went on find my iphone to take the next steps :  ul liI tried to locate it, but it was offline (probably because there was no battery at the time it was stolen)./li liSo next, I decided to Lock it. The Lock was 'pending' for another day or so./li liAfter that I decided to erase it. So I pressed erase and then it said erase was 'pending', however the 'lock is pending' was not there. /li /ul  Both the lock and erase buttons are faded out.   ul liDoes this mean my mac has been locked? /li liIf it was locked, would the location have been sent to me right before?/li liCan I locate/erase it now?/li liIf it has been locked, is it possible for people to access my information?/li /ul  <answer76323> I think your mac is just out of juice and all those things like locking/erasing/locating will happen when your mac gets power or when someone turns your mac on.   So normally no one will be able to access your information.   <comment88605> Thanks, I'm just going to try and stop worrying about it!
