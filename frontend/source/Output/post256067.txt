What is application coupond? <body> When I boot up I'm getting a dialog box saying "the application coupond wants to accept incoming connections". The thing is I don't have an application coupond. Also, when checking my firewall settings it doesn't show any application coupond in the list of programs to allow incoming connections. When I do a search in Finder there is no match for the word coupond. I have a 2011 iMac running Sierra. This has been happening before I upgraded from ElCap. My iMac is running fine, but I am reluctant to allow an incoming connection if I don't know what it is.   Does anyone know what the application coupond is?  <comment319199> Please search before you post.
