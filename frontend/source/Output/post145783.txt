Apple Mail is trying to use certificate and won't send without <body> I created an account on a website and they installed a certificate on my machine for authentication. I'm not sure how this technically works but the certificate is somehow linked to my GMail address.  Now, when I want to write an e-mail from Apple Mail (from my GMail address), Apple Mail asks me if I want to use this certificate that I mentioned above.  If I say "allow access" it sends my e-mail just fine. However, I strongdon't/strong want to use this certificate to send e-mails but if I deny Apple Mail to use this certificate, nothing happens. strongIt doesn't send the e-mail, it doesn't give me an error message, it doesn't even put it in the "Sent" or "Outbox" folder in the sidebar./strong  I can see the certificate in my Keychain Access under "My Certificates" if that helps.  Can anybody help me with this?  Thanks a lot!  <answer145787> I just noticed that there is a new toggle button available in Apple Mail when writing a new mail that lets me send the mail without digitally signing it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ovDrR.png" alt="Turn of digital signing"
