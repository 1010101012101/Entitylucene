Calculator small exponent gives zero <body> When I try to do the following calculation using Calculator app I get 0.  precode$E=N_A\frac{h\cdot c}{\lambda}$ /code/pre  where codeN_a/code is Avogadros number code6.022x10^23 mol^{-1}/code, codeh/code is Planck's Constant code6.626 x 10^-34 Js/code, codec/code is the speed of light code2.998 x 10^8 ms^-1/codeand code\lambda/code is the wavelength of light, so lets say code400 x 10-9 m/code  I should get code299 kJ mol-1/code but Calculator gives me a big fat 0.  If I input Planck's Constant and try a simple operation on it it returns 0.  Obviously the issue is with small exponentials but they are not equal to 0!  Am I overlooking something obvious?  <comment221318> math way outside my league, but Calculator is only good to 15 decimal places, afaik. <comment221440> The Calculator app in iOS8 can handle it though! Strange anomaly! Maybe a feature request for Yosemite 10.10.next_one or whatever pat of the U.S. they decide to call it.
