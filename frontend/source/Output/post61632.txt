Script to create iPhone Contacts <body> Does anyone know of a way to create a Contact list with a defined amount of contacts? They can be dummy entries, but I just need to create an address book with  2000 entries. An Automator script is what I have in mind, but I'm not sure how to go about this.  I apologize if this is in the wrong place. Was considering SU or SE, but figured I'd start here.  <answer61642> An Applescript can bulk-create OS X address book entries, which you can then import to your iPhone. I made up a basic one for you:  precode-- Change these to your desired data set firstName to "Test" set lastName to "User" set numberOfEntries to "5" as integer  set counter to "1" as integer tell application "Address Book"     repeat numberOfEntries times         set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:firstName, last name:lastName &amp; " " &amp; counter}         make new email at end of emails of thePerson with properties {label:"Work", value:"test" &amp; counter &amp; "@example.com"}         make new address at end of addresses of thePerson with properties {label:"Home", city:"Fakeville", street:(counter as string) &amp; " Some St."}         set counter to counter + 1     end repeat     save end tell /code/pre  Open emAppleScript Editor/em (in your codeApplications/Utilities//code folder) and paste that in to a new script. As is, it will make you 5 numbered contacts like so: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3qBJq.png" alt="example contacts"  You can change the number in the codeset numberOfEntries to "5" as integer/code line to however many you need, and change the data if you wish. If you need other fields (like phone numbers), ask and I can show you how.  h3Improved version/h3  I went a bit overboard and made a version that comes up with nicer names. I took the 20 most popular male and female names, 40 most popular last names, and added a middle initial, so you get a pretty low chance of duplicates (a bit under 5% in a set of 2000, by my math) without the goofy looking numbered contacts.  It also adds all the contacts to a group ("Test Group") so you can pick out all the dummy ones easily if you're adding to an existing address book and want to clean it up later.  emEdit:/em I also changed it to prompt for how many items to create, so it's not necessary to edit the code.  precode-- name lists: 20 most popular (US) male and female first names, 40 most popular last names set firstNameList to {"Mary", "Patricia", "Linda", "Barbara", "Elizabeth", "Jennifer", "Maria", "Susan", "Margaret", "Dorothy", "Lisa", "Nancy", "Karen", "Betty", "Helen", "Sandra", "Donna", "Carol", "Ruth", "Sharon", "James", "John", "Robert", "Michael", "William", "David", "Richard", "Charles", "Joseph", "Thomas", "Christopher", "Daniel", "Paul", "Mark", "Donald", "George", "Kenneth", "Steven", "Edward", "Brian"} set lastNameList to {"Smith", "Johnson", "Williams", "Jones", "Brown", "Davis", "Miller", "Wilson", "Moore", "Taylor", "Anderson", "Thomas", "Jackson", "White", "Harris", "Martin", "Thompson", "Garcia", "Martinez", "Robinson", "Clark", "Rodriguez", "Lewis", "Lee", "Walker", "Hall", "Allen", "Young", "Hernandez", "King", "Wright", "Lopez", "Hill", "Scott", "Green", "Adams", "Baker", "Gonzalez", "Nelson", "Carter"} set initialList to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" set counter to "1" as integer  -- prompt for how many contacts to create set dialogText to "Number of contacts to create?" repeat     display dialog dialogText default answer ""     set numberOfEntries to text returned of result     try         if numberOfEntries = "" then error         set numberOfEntries to numberOfEntries as number         exit repeat     on error      end try end repeat  -- populate the address book tell application "Address Book"     set theGroup to make new group with properties {name:"Test Group"}     repeat numberOfEntries times         set firstName to some item of firstNameList         set lastName to some item of lastNameList         set middleInitial to some item of initialList &amp; "."         set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:firstName, middle name:middleInitial, last name:lastName}         make new email at end of emails of thePerson with properties {label:"Work", value:firstName &amp; middleInitial &amp; lastName &amp; "@example.com"}         make new address at end of addresses of thePerson with properties {label:"Home", city:"Fakeville", street:(counter as string) &amp; " Some St."}         add thePerson to theGroup         set counter to counter + 1     end repeat     save end tell /code/pre  Here's what it generates: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8CeKe.png" alt="dummy contacts 2"  <answer129211> I have used Rob's code in shorter form to create an Automator Service that lets you right-click on an email and create a contact:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aIivN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thanks very much Rob - you've saved me hours and hours of work :-)  <comment71169> Looks PERFECT! Thanks! I'll test it out and let you know if I need anything else! <comment76676> Man I wish I could +1000 this for the extra effort. Thanks again!!! <comment76677> You're welcome, glad it was useful. Sometimes it's fun to just put together a little script to solve one problem. <comment76694> I changed the "improved" version to include a prompt for the number of contacts to generate, rather than requiring the script to be edited.
