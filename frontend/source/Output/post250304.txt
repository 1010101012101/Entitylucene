How do you remove the Automator gear icon in the menu bar? <body> I have Automator workflow applications that I run from keyboard shortcuts. It is great, however, a small gear icon always appears.  I would like to remove it.   ol liHow do you do this?/li liI usually remove all the pixels from the image of menu bar icons of applications, so they are invisible in the menu bar. I could easily do this with Automator (or the Automator application launcher), but can't find where the menu bar icons are stored. Where would they be stored?/li /ol  <answer250310> You can install Bartender to manage and hide the menu bar items. You can either choose to hide it completely, or stuff it under a separate standalone menu bar.  The spinning gear originated from a core system app called "ScriptMonitor" which you can find in the following file path:  code/System/Library/CoreServices/ScriptMonitor.app/code  If you own Bartender, you can manually add the add by clicking on the plus icon found in bottom right part of the preferences. The gear icon will appear briefly, but it should remain hidden while the processes are running.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zLVnV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer294085> If you are using a shell script, you can add "killall ScriptMonitor" at the top of it.  <comment310755> I'm curious as to why you do what you expressed in the first sentence of number 2? As to removing it, you do realize that it provides a control mechanism to stop the Automator workflow application, if need be? <comment310756> @user3439894 So I don't have my menu bar cluttered up. I currently have Flux invisible like this. If I want to disable an app with an invisible menu bar icon, I just click on it and the dropdown menu appears. It just makes it so that the icon is invisible; everything works fine. <comment310758> Ah, yes. I own a registered copy of Bartender and heard that it was possible to do this, but haven't succeeded in hiding the Automator application workflow menu bar icon. How do you do this? <comment310796> @samseva see updated answer. <comment310813> The Automator application doesn't last long; I was hoping to completely hide it (which knowing where the icon files are, would work). However, your tip will certainly be useful for applications that last longer (or anyone looking for this solution). Thanks!
