How to pass a comman line parameter to MS Word for Mac? <body> I would like to open a Word file and execute a Macro at startup. In Windows it works like this:  precode"...\WINWORD.EXE" I:\Temp\filename.docm /mMakro1 /code/pre  On OSX I'm able to open a Word file via Terminal with  precodeopen -a "Microsoft Word" /users/myname/Desktop/filename.docm /code/pre  but how do I pass the parameter to run a macro?  <comment314039> I do not use Microsoft Office, so I can't test and why a comment vs. an answer, however to pass arguments when using `open -a ...`, use `--args arg1 ...`. In Terminal type `open` then right-click on `open` and select **Open man Page**, then read. :) <comment314804> Intermediate status: (1) Thank you for the information which I have overseen in the man pages with open -a "Microsoft Word" /Users/mynamet/Desktop/filename.docm --args m Macro3 I have been able to start Word but the macro does not start Identical result with ... --args mMacro3.. <comment314805> Intermediate status: (2) with a Word macro called "AutoOpen" I am able to run this special macro at startup
