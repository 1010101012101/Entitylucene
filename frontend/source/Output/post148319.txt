2 email accounts <body> I have 2 email accounts on my iPhone 6 and both contact lists are merging. I also have facebook email addresses merging. Is there a way to make them all stop merging? I'm trying to keep work and personal emails separate.   <comment174747> What do you mean by "merging"? Displaying the mails from both accounts in one inbox in the Mail app? You've got separate inboxes for all your accounts and one displaying the mails from all accounts.
