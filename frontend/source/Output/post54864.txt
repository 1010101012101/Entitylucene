Full guide on configuring NIS/NFS on OS X 10.7? <body> I am trying to setup OS X 10.7 Lion to work as an a NIS/NFS client but without too much success so far.  h2Existing configuration that works on Ubuntu/h2  precodecat /etc/yp.conf domain uk.example.com server 10.80.16.129  cat /etc/auto.master  /usr/groups yp:auto.groups --timeout=3600 /home yp:auto.home --timeout=3600 /nistest yp:auto.misc --timeout=3600 /misc yp:auto.misc --timeout=3600  &gt;ypwhich nis2.uk.example.com /code/pre  h2Configuration on OS X (that does not work yet)/h2  I tried to add the NIS domain using codeSystem Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Unlock &gt; Login Options &gt; Join... &gt; Open Directory Utility.../code  (yes Apple did a great job on making this as hard as possible to access).   There edit the codeNIS/code record and add the NIS domain codeuk.example.com/code (not the same as  DNS domain) and the IP address of this NIS domain code10.80.16.129/code and obviously checked the codeUse NIS for authentication/code.  I rebooted but this did not help. Still, interesting on login screen there was a tooltip saying that network login is unavailable.   I logged in with an admin account, logged out but the situation did not change.  h2Debugging/h2  precode&gt;ypwhich nis2.uk.example.com /code/pre  cat /var/log/opendirectory.log  precode 2012-06-27 10:46:50.575 BST - opendirectoryd (build 172.13) launched... 2012-06-27 10:46:50.577 BST - Logging level limit changed to 'error' 2012-06-27 10:46:50.600 BST - Initialize trigger support 2012-06-27 10:46:50.610 BST - Registered node with name '/Active Directory' as hidden 2012-06-27 10:46:50.611 BST - Registered node with name '/Configure' as hidden 2012-06-27 10:46:50.612 BST - Discovered configuration for node name '/Contacts' at path '/Library/Preferences/OpenDirectory/Configurations//Contacts.plist' 2012-06-27 10:46:50.612 BST - Registered node with name '/Contacts' 2012-06-27 10:46:50.614 BST - Registered node with name '/LDAPv3' as hidden 2012-06-27 10:46:50.617 BST - Registered node with name '/Local' as hidden 2012-06-27 10:46:50.619 BST - Registered node with name '/NIS' as hidden 2012-06-27 10:46:50.620 BST - Discovered configuration for node name '/Search' at path '/Library/Preferences/OpenDirectory/Configurations//Search.plist' 2012-06-27 10:46:50.620 BST - Registered node with name '/Search' 2012-06-27 10:46:50.626 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/legacy.bundle' 2012-06-27 10:46:50.632 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/search.bundle' 2012-06-27 10:46:51.636 BST - '/Search' has registered, loading additional services 2012-06-27 10:46:51.636 BST - Initialize augmentation support 2012-06-27 10:46:51.642 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/SystemCache.bundle' 2012-06-27 10:46:51.647 BST - Successfully registered for Kernel identity service requests 2012-06-27 10:46:51.653 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/PlistFile.bundle' 2012-06-27 10:46:51.656 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/FDESupport.bundle' 2012-06-27 10:46:51.707 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/ConfigurationProfiles.bundle' 2012-06-27 10:46:51.708 BST - Registered subnode with name '/Local/Default' 2012-06-27 10:46:51.712 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/nis.bundle' 2012-06-27 10:46:51.713 BST - Registered subnode with name '/NIS/uk.example.com' 2012-06-27 10:47:21.743 BST - 239.839.841.843 - Client: automount, UID: 0, EUID: 0, GID: 0, EGID: 0 2012-06-27 10:47:21.743 BST - 239.839.841.843, Node: /NIS/uk.example.com, Module: nis - could not determine map for rectype 'mounts' attribute 'byname' 2012-06-27 11:10:30.994 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/configure.bundle' 2012-06-27 11:10:30.996 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/keychain.bundle' 2012-06-27 11:10:31.010 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/ldap.bundle' 2012-06-27 11:10:31.017 BST - Loaded bundle at path '/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Modules/ActiveDirectory.bundle' 2012-06-27 11:11:06.745 BST - 1801.3397 - Client: Directory Utili, UID: 501, EUID: 501, GID: 20, EGID: 20 2012-06-27 11:11:06.745 BST - 1801.3397, Node: /NIS/uk.example.com, Module: nis - could not determine map for rectype 'mounts' attribute 'byname' 2012-06-27 11:15:42.254 BST - 1801.4096 - Client: Directory Utili, UID: 501, EUID: 501, GID: 20, EGID: 20 2012-06-27 11:15:42.254 BST - 1801.4096, Node: /NIS/uk.example.com, Module: nis - could not determine map for rectype 'mounts' attribute 'byname'  /code/pre  <comment82301> I think osx is not suitable for network use ( lion, mount lion) as Finder has a huge bug un refresh folder/ file with nfs
