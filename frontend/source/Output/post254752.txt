Is it possible to freely move the Picture in Picture window around the screen? <body> Is it possible to freely move the Picture in Picture window? By default, it just snaps to the nearest corner. How can I move the window to any place I like?  <answer254753> It is possible. Just hold down the kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd button and drag the Picture in Picture window anywhere you desire.  <comment317191> I was able to simply drag it, without using the command key.
