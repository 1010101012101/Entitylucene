Customising Lion’s accented letters <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Add characters to the press and hold character picker in OS X Lion       I’m slightly disappointed by Lion’s iOS inspired feature to show a selection of accented characters on key hold.  On a German keyboard, when pressing kbda/kbd, I am able to choose between codeä/code,  codeâ/code, codeà/code, codeá/code, codeæ/code, codeã/code, codeå/code, codeā/code. So far so nice.  However, I feel some characters are missing. There is no codeç/code (although I could type this one using kbdoption/kbd+kbdc/kbd), no codeğ/code and no codeł/code either. On the other hand the letter codeń/code is shown (which like codeł/code is more or less only used in Polish) but to which OS X does not show an upper case version. kbdshift/kbd+kbdn/kbd yields no results.  Is there some way to enhance and expand this set of letters with own additions?  <answer46435> This problem has been solved recently elsewhere in the forum:  How to add characters to the press and hold character picker in OS X Lion?  <comment38738> This isn't an answer per se, but in the System Preferences under International and then the Input Menu you can have the OS display a menubar menu called "Character Palette". The Character Palette shows all the characters available, allows you to insert them, and allows you to build lists of favorites. <comment42043> Again, an inconsistent behavior.... I don't get how the developers could forget to implement access to `ç` by holding the c-key. Good question! <comment53061> Would you like me to merge this account with the other?
