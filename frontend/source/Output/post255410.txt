Select artwork for iTunes screensaver <body> I would like to be able to select or at least exclude songs for my iTunes screensaver.   I have two playlist emiTunes artwork screensaver/em (it might not be exactly the title because I'm translating from the french emÉconomisateur d'écran des illustrations iTunes/em), but if I put music in these playlist, it doesn't affect the screen saver which still contains random title.  Any idea?
