LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 Can't open 'Install OS X Yosemite.app' <body> I'm trying to install OS X Yosemite through 'Install OS X Yosemite.app' downloaded from the Internet. When I try to open it by double clicking it, nothing happens. When I use the terminal I get the following message:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code$ open /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/ LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app. /code/pre  <answer181031> That would seem to imply the executable within the package isn't actually executable.   Where did you get it from?br If not Apple, I'd leave it well alone. If it was from Apple, try this in Terminal  codechmod +x /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/MacOS/InstallAssistant/code  <answer234293> I had this error when attempting to run an application from an ssh terminal while the screen was locked. The app complained that the user did not have permission to open a GCWindow.  Unlock the screen by logging in, and my app now launches fine.  <answer262228> I mysteriously got this on Yosemite for the Calendar app.  Launching the actual binary worked for me.  precodebash$ /Applications/Calendar.app/Contents/MacOS/Calendar &amp; /code/pre  There did not seem to be a permissions issue that could be fixed with codechmod/code.  The symptom I got originally was strong"The application "Calendar.app" is not open anymore"/strong when attempting to click calendar reservations in Mail.app.  <comment215179> Install on to what ? <comment215358> It works. Thank you very much! <comment215360> Glad it worked for you - please feel free to mark my answer as correct ;) <comment243784> This helped me, but I just wanted to add that I fixed my problem (running Kettle Pentaho 4.4 on OS X Yosemite) by making the same permissions change to `Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub` in my `.app` directory. <comment243789> Add that as another answer - it may be helpful for future Googlers
