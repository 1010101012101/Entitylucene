Unable to install Windows via Boot Camp - Unable to Partition <body> I am unable to proceed beyond the initial screens of Boot Camp in order to install Windows 10.  I am told the:  codeThe startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition./code  Upon checking I only have a single partition, my OS X partition, as per the screenshot below.  If I dismiss that prompt there is no way to proceed with an installation.  So, how do I install Windows 10?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h05gP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Output of: codesudo fdisk /dev/disk0/code  precodeDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 19457/255/63 [312581808 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  312581807] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       /code/pre  And output of codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0/code  precode      start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  311909984      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   312319624     262151            312581775         32         Sec GPT table   312581807          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  Macbook model is: codeMacbookPro5,5/code  <answer294339> I guess you've solved it by now, but I had exactly the same problem with fresh new Macbook pro 2017 and I had to reinstall the system (MacOS). Then the installation of Windows 10 through bootcamp went fine.  <comment364868> I used to have a Recovery HD, had the same issue.  Most of the recommendations on the internet say to get rid of Recovery HD, so I did.  Same thing with that too. <comment364872> @klanomath I've just updated my answer, thanks <comment364876> OK the last MB/MBPs (originally) shipped with 160 GB disks are from the year 2009. The newest Windows possible is Windows 7 and you can't install Win10 on them. Please add your Mac model. <comment364878> I'm happy to install Windows 7 instead.  Model is MacbookPro5,5 - just added to question
