How to Remove a Word from Dictionary of Google Chrome? <body> I added the word codesomehting/code (or similar) by accident to Dictionary of OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 in Google Chrome  2nd click.  I would like to remove it from there.  I go to Dictionary but I cannot find by the Search tool, etc only codesomeh/code and no success.  So I should be able to find recently added words or user words.   hr  How can remove a recently added word in Dictionary of Google Chrome?  <answer235883> h2user3439894's proposal/h2  Content in code/Users/masi/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Custom\ Dictionary.txt/code  precodesomehting checksum_v1 = 2e0427564c95a02fc68d601104512ebd /code/pre  which you can just delete.  <answer261301> in the address bar go to codechrome://settings/editDictionary/code and you can search and delete any entry you want.   <answer294279> On macOS Chrome 60, settings do not let you access the dictionary. Words are actually added in two places where you can manually edit them:  precode~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Custom\ Dictionary.txt  ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary /code/pre  Then restart your mac for changes to take effect.  <comment287629> I do not believe one can add a word to the OS X Dictionary.app from Google Chrome and what do you mean by "Google Chrome  2nd click"? Have you looked at editing, "~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Custom Dictionary.txt"? <comment288512> @user3439894 There are views where you can add word to some dictionary. I do not know which dictionary that is. You are right! I found the thing in custom dictionary. Can I remove the input there? See the body. Please, make your comment an answer. <comment288519> Answers should be posted as such, and not added to the question. <comment327235> update: I think this is wrong. seems to not be working on mac. on mac you have to locate the LocalDictionary by going to Users/yourname/Library/Spelling.
