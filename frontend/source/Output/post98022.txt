Is there a shortcut for opening a second buffer with a vertical split in Aquamacs? <body> I'd like to have two buffers open side by side in Aquamacs. Is there a shortcut for doing this?   I know that C-x 2 opens them in a vertical stack, I'd like to have them arranged horizontally though.  <answer98023> You are looking for codesplit-window-horizontally/code which is bound to C-x 3.
