Calendar that is able to send invites from different email adresses <body> I am looking for a calendar app for mac, where I can choose email address that is used for sending invitations. By default, ical sends invitations with email account that is "hosting" the calendar.  For example, I import my business email into Gmail account, then I add this business email into System Preferences - Internet Accounts. I create a new calendar in my Gmail account and add this calendar into iCal. If I send an invite in iCal, invitation is sent by default gmail account and I don't have any option to change that.  <comment341156> Please add the additional info to this question instead of linking to a different site.
