Odd Console error messages with mdworker -- 10.7 <body> Every ten seconds, a new variation on the following error messages show up in my Console:     7/24/13 12:38:20.280 PM mdworker: (Error) Import: import worker will not import on behalf of root user.  Exiting.   7/24/13 12:38:20.281 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.0: (com.apple.mdworker.pool.framework.0[18055]) Exited with code: 77   7/24/13 12:38:20.281 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.0: (com.apple.mdworker.pool.framework.0) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds   Any idea what might be causing this?  I am in the middle of a complicated migration from a 2008 MacBook to a 2011 MBP, and I know that are some useless artifacts that have come over, but I have no idea what it might have been that causes this annoying recurring message.
