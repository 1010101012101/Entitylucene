Audio cutting out at certain points <body> I'm trying to listen to a podcast through Apple's headphones on my Macbook Pro (Retina, 13 Inch, mid 2014), running OS X 10.10.1, but the audio keeps cutting out.  When the audio cuts out, the following log messages appear in the Console app:  precode26/11/14 18:27:51,370 AirPlayUIAgent[348]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.369515 PM [AirPlayAVSys] AirPlay became the default audio device 26/11/14 18:27:51,378 discoveryd[51]: AwdlD2d AwdlD2dStartBrowsingForKey: '_raop' Browsing service started 26/11/14 18:27:51,379 discoveryd[51]: AwdlD2d AwdlD2dStartBrowsingForKey: '_airplay' Browsing service started 26/11/14 18:27:51,407 SystemUIServer[198]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.407192 PM [AirPlayAVSys] AirPlay became the default audio device 26/11/14 18:27:51,437 coreaudiod[597]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.436712 PM [AirPlay] Set up for stream GeneralAudio, PCM/44100/16/2 -&gt; ALAC/44100/16/2 26/11/14 18:27:51,437 coreaudiod[597]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.436854 PM [AirPlay] Available DNS names: Infra [84383554262E@Julia\032-\032MacBook\032Air._raop._tcp.local.%4], P2P [intentionally disabled] 26/11/14 18:27:51,437 coreaudiod[597]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.436997 PM [AirPlay] Pairing not required.

How do I stop this from happening?  Rebooting doesn't help. Also, I'm in a library, so I currently can't test playing audio without headphones.  <answer158270> When I asked this question, I only had one option in the audio output devices list in my audio preferences. When I went back some time later, I noticed an option called code[someone's name] - Macbook Air/code. I accidentally clicked it, and quickly set the setting back to my headphones. This seems to have fixed the problem.  <comment186045> Which Apple Headphones? <comment186047> The standard earbuds that come with an iPhone. I bought a new pair yesterday. They're from apple, not some other vendor. <comment186068> that "someone" wont be happy not getting your music to play any more :)
