Which process is using port 4000 (identified as remoteanything by nmap)? <body> I've run codenmap -sS [computer ip]/code and see that i only have one service running:  precodePORT     STATE SERVICE 4000/tcp open  remoteanything /code/pre  What service is this? Should i close it? I've googled and only found some shady stuff: http://remote-anything.com/  Maybe it is used by some of my other programs?   <answer232797> codenmap/code just makes a guess at the service here, as basically any application can bind to any port. To see which specific application it is in your case, run  precodelsof -i :4000 /code/pre  <comment284482> Thanks! Got this: `COMMAND    PID      USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME thnuclnt 63892 USER    3u  IPv4 0x579547807ed98faf      0t0  TCP *:terabase (LISTEN)`  Googled it and it is most likely used by VMWare, thank you!
