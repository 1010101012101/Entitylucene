Remote Desktop Disconnects WiFi <body> I have a Mac Mini running OSX 10.7.5, on which I have enabled "Screen Sharing", with password.  I have a laptop running Windows 7, with UltraVNC Viewer.  When entering my credentials, it says "connecting", then it says my connection was lost. When I go back to my Mac, I noticed that the WiFi got disconnected. I tried a few times, and can now say for sure: connecting to the VNC server somehow disconnects the WiFi instantly (which of course means I can't access it).  <comment112438> What is your Screen Sharing setup  and permissions? <comment117276> Did you find a solution? It happens with a Mountain Lion system (10.8.4) too. <comment117730> I switched to Ethernet...
