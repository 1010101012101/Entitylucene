Where does Safari Web Inspector store images? <body> I am currently running OS X El Capitan, Public Beta 3 and trying to download images within the Safari Web Inspector.  What I did:  ol liOpened a website in Safari./li liOpened the Web Inspector./li liSelected one of images from the Images folder./li liRight-clicked and selected "Download Image"./li /ol  Unfortunately, nothing happened.  Should the images be downloaded to the Download folder? Am I missing something, or is it a bug in the latest Safari Beta?  <answer200733> This indeed looks to be a bug.  You can watch all file access on your system with the codeopensnoop/code command. This requires root access - run it, then try hitting the download button - you'll see no access from Safari.  Time to hit Feedback Assistant and tell them what's going on!  The earlier comment is a good workaround - once the image is displayed, just hit CMD-C to copy it for pasting elsewhere.  <comment241915> I always just do a copy and the paste into preview. <comment241959> Or drag the image into a Finder window
