Can I use GNU source in my iOS app? <body> I'm going to use some GPL-covered code in my app. Firstly, I'm not sure if GPL is compatible with Apple's App Store, i.e. whether apps entirely covered by GPL can be published through App Store.  Second, iOS does not allow 3rd party dynamic libraries, which means, to my understanding, you can't legally combine GPL and non-GPL code in one iOS app.  So what are my options if I want to use some GNU code in my app?  <answer192413> As this is a legal question you have to ask a lawyer about this, any answer on the internet (including this) is not reliable  However The Free Software Foundation (which write the GPL) have written this blog about GPL v2 and the App Store http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/more-about-the-app-store-gpl-enforcement  This includes      That's the problem in a nutshell: Apple's Terms of Service impose restrictive limits on use and distribution for any software distributed through the App Store, and the GPL doesn't allow that.    <comment228816> Voting to leave open because this a licensing question about Apple products, only superficially related to programming. <comment228846> You need to ask a lawyer. But I would note than vlc was withdrawn form app store because one of the authors of the GNU code did not want it there and pointed out that using Apple's signing and other code broke the GNU licence. <comment228849> Note that stack overflow will reject this as licence questions are off topic there (and I think are off topic anywhere on stack exchange as requires legal advice) <comment228852> @Mark Why don't you post this as an answer? <comment228931> Apple via iTunes connect has customer support and you could ask them about including specific versions of open source code. Worst case, you could contact the authors of the code you want and ask for a license that allows you to do your work. I would say if you can't afford legal advice on understanding licensing, you'll want to be sure you only use code you are confident you understand the licensing terms or write it all yourself. <comment228932> Can we presume you need many pieces of code and various licenses (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/old-licenses.html#GPL) and haven't asked GNU foundation for assistance? Also, can we assume you are using the app store for distribution and that your app is free for users to download (no money for you or Apple)? I'm putting a temporary hold - you already have a fine general answer, but without refining your situation (where you reside and what licenses specifically you are seeking to understand) it's quite a large undertaking to explain all the various gnu licenses...
