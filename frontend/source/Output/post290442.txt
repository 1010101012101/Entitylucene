Apple Diagnostic Mode (Hardware Test) not available MBPr 15‚Äù Late 2013 <body> I own a late 2013 MBPr with a dedicated graphics card. The other day, I tried to access Apple Diagnostic Mode/Hardware Test (D key at startup), but without success. The laptop just booted normally. I have two partitions: one HFS+ running 10.12.6 beta 6 and the other APFS running 10.13 public beta 1.  Is there any reason I would be unable to access AHT? I tried looking around online, but all I got was information about OS X Lion, with no good solutions. Is there a way to repair my access to AHT?  <comment366599> Ugh @Allan how did I not find that before. The answer there worked for me. Please close this as a duplicate.
