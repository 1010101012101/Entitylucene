Macbook pro mid 2012 15" i7 2,3 display dark after mainboard repair <body> I destroyed my MacBook (mid 2011 with 1440 resolution) with one liter of water in the main board. When the logicboards got chaper I decided to buy one (mid 2012 with 1440 or 1680 resolution) and built it in, I also added a new battery.  During that repair the LCD cable broke (pins broke at the end edge to logic board), now I added a new cable but the 1440 screen still remains dark.  So if LCD cable is connected:  ul lifans turn/li lipulsing light short time on/li lino start sound/li liinternal screen black, logo off/li liexternal screen only works if connecting later, then it is grey nothing happens (no text to sign, no logo)/li /ul  If LCD cable is not disconnected:  ul licomputer start on external screen normally/li listart sound works/li /ul  What could cause this problem with the internal screen and how can I fix it?  <comment212632> Have you carefully checked the logic board display connector is free from any damage and remnants from the old cable? And, are you absolutely sure the connector at the display end is correctly seated? <comment212713> i cannot see any damage on the logic board connector <comment212714> iÂ´m sure that it is mouted correct at the display end <comment212715> is there a trick to try if the connector cable has power for example? <comment212748> Do a Google image search for **macbook lvds pinout**. You'll be able to check the basic power lines but the actual display signals will require a high-bandwidth oscilloscope. It's not a safe assumption to make that the display connections will be exactly the same on models a year apart (although there's a large chance they *are* the same) so this is worth researching just to make sure that's not causing the issue. It doesn't look like the machine is passing the Power On Self Test, hence no display, so either the cable is incompatible, or the connector has internal damage  (bent pins etc.)... <comment212830> ok found out something. the display is working perfectly, but its dark. i couldnt see first, but when i took out the panel and connected it to the board i could see that it tis working. also the keyboard light does not work. <comment212834> So is your MacBook starting up normally now (except for the dark screen and keyboard backlight)? <comment212840> thats correct. with a old scren, brand new logic board, brand new lvds calbe <comment212876> Okay, a few thoughts. I recently repaired a Dell Inspiron 1545 with exactly the same issue, screen working but no backlight. The cause was traced back to the LVDS cable at the panel end, the connector had come slightly loose. Once reseated, the display backlighting worked properly again. However you said you'd checked that so it's either a logic board connector problem/faulty cable - or - the backlight circuitry on the display was damaged by water penetrating the LVDS cable on the logic board, possibly causing a short circuit. The panel is the only thing that hasn't been replaced so far...
