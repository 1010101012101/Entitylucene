Unable to install Meld via MacPorts 2.0.3 on OSX 10.6.8 <body> I am trying to get Meld onto my OS X 10.6.8 box using MacPorts 2.0.3 and am not having success.  precodebobk-mbp:opt bobk$ port version Version: 2.0.3 bobk-mbp:opt bobk$ sudo port install meld ---&gt;  Computing dependencies for meld ---&gt;  Dependencies to be installed: py26-gnome libgnomeui py26-gtk py26-cairo py26-numpy fftw-3 py26-nose py26-distribute python26 py26-py py26-gobject py26-orbit ---&gt;  Building libgnomeui Error: Target org.macports.build returned: shell command failed (see log for details) Error: Failed to install libgnomeui Log for libgnomeui is at: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_gnome_libgnomeui/libgnomeui/main.log Error: The following dependencies were not installed: py26-gnome libgnomeui py26-gtk py26-cairo py26-numpy fftw-3 py26-nose py26-distribute python26 py26-py py26-gobject py26-orbit Error: Status 1 encountered during processing. To report a bug, see &lt;http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets&gt; /code/pre  When I look at /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_gnome_libgnomeui/libgnomeui/main.log it has a line like...  precode:error:build Failed to install libgnomeui :debug:build couldn't open "/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.5/Resources/tclIndex": no such file or directory     while executing "open [file join $dir tclIndex]" :notice:build Log for libgnomeui is at: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_gnome_libgnomeui/libgnomeui/main.log /code/pre  ...and that file is indeed missing on my system.  Where do I go from here?  I really want a piece of that Meld goodness.  Why can't MacPorts install meld on my os x 10.6.8 box?  <answer41473> Running codemdfind -name tclIndex/code on Mac OS X 10.6.8 shows that the path to codetclIndex/code is code/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.5/Resourcesb/Scripts//btclIndex/code!  Anyway, if there is a pristine MacPorts 2.0.3 system running on Mac OS X 10.6.8, codemeld/code gets installed without any (serious) complaints.  The same goes for codekoffice/code provided that it can use an older version of libpng (&lt; 1.4); this can be achieved by giving codekoffice/code its own fresh MacPorts 2.0.3 system in a custom location, e. g. code/opt/macports-koffice/code.  Try the following Bash script to see if this approach works for your machine as well:  precode#!/bin/bash  # cat mpmeld # # 1. back up the old /opt/local MacPorts system by moving it to ${opt_local_off} # 2. install a fresh MacPorts 2.0.3 system to /opt/local for building meld  # 3. install a fresh MacPorts 2.0.3 system to /opt/macports-koffice for building koffice (due to PNG_MAX_UINT error)  # usage:  # sudo -H -i                                                 # get a root shell to prevent sudo timeout # /path/to/mpmeld 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;- | tee mpmeld.log       # swap stdout &amp; stderr to log stderr messages only  # koffice usage: # /opt/macports-koffice/bin/port contents koffice | grep '/bin/' | nl # /opt/macports-koffice/bin/kword 2&gt;/dev/null # /opt/macports-koffice/bin/koconverter --help-all  # See also: # What does 'Xlib: extension "RANDR" missing on display "/tmp/launch-XXXXXX/:0"' mean? # https://trac.macports.org/wiki/FAQ#randr  unset CDPATH PATH IFS LC_ALL  IFS=$' \t\n' LC_ALL=C PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin export IFS LC_ALL PATH  #if [[ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]]; then if [[ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]] || [[ "${HOME}" != '/var/root' ]]; then    echo 'This script must be run as root!' 1&gt;&amp;2    echo 'To get a root shell to prevent sudo timeout use: sudo -H -i' 1&gt;&amp;2    exit 1 fi  # prevent idle sleep pmset noidle &amp; PMSETPID=$! pmset -a force sleep 0 displaysleep 0 disksleep 0  sleep 1 usr_local_off="/usr/local-off-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S')" opt_local_off="/opt/local-off-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S')" opt_macports_koffice_off="/opt/macports-koffice-off-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S')"   tmpDir="$(mktemp -d /tmp/macports.XXXXXX)" || exit 1  trap "    #set -xv    cd    # avoid: sudo: cannot get working directory    [[ -d '${tmpDir}' ]] &amp;&amp; rm -rfv '${tmpDir}'    [[ -d '${usr_local_off}' ]] &amp;&amp; sudo mv -iv '${usr_local_off}' /usr/local    kill -TERM ${PMSETPID}    exit " EXIT TERM HUP INT QUIT  # make sure /usr/local is not interfering with MacPorts build processes for /opt/local [[ -d '/usr/local' ]] &amp;&amp; sudo mv -iv /usr/local "${usr_local_off}"  # back up the old MacPorts system [[ -d '/opt/local' ]] &amp;&amp; sudo mv -iv /opt/local "${opt_local_off}"  # back up /opt/macports-koffice [[ -d '/opt/macports-koffice' ]] &amp;&amp; sudo mv -iv /opt/macports-koffice "${opt_macports_koffice_off}"   # meld  cd "${tmpDir}" || exit 1  curl -L -O https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.0.3-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg  hdiutil mount MacPorts-2.0.3-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg installer -pkg /Volumes/MacPorts-2.0.3/MacPorts-2.0.3.pkg -target "/" hdiutil unmount /Volumes/MacPorts-2.0.3  port -v selfupdate port -f install meld  # enable dbus with launchd launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist   # koffice  # get a fresh MacPorts 2.0.3 install in /opt/macports-koffice for koffice # note: koffice @1.6.3, Revision 4  requires libpng &lt; 1.4  (due to PNG_MAX_UINT error)  cd "${tmpDir}" || exit 1  # cf. http://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.source.multiple unset PATH export PATH='/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin' curl -L -O https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.0.3.tar.bz2 tar -xjf MacPorts-2.0.3.tar.bz2 cd MacPorts-2.0.3 || exit 1 MP_PREFIX='/opt/macports-koffice' ./configure --prefix="${MP_PREFIX}" --with-applications-dir="${MP_PREFIX}/Applications" make make install  # get the Portfiles and update the system /opt/macports-koffice/bin/port -v selfupdate   # see: "How to install an older version of a port",  # https://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/InstallingOlderPort  cd "${tmpDir}" || exit 1 svn co -r 71090 http://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/trunk/dports/graphics/libpng chmod  755 "${tmpDir}"  # avoid error message: could not read "/path/to/Portfile": permission denied cd libpng || exit 1 /opt/macports-koffice/bin/port install -v +universal cd "${tmpDir}" || exit 1  /opt/macports-koffice/bin/port -f install koffice  find /Applications/MacPorts /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons -name "*.mp_*[[:digit:]]" -delete  exit 0 /code/pre  <answer41478> It looks like you need to (re)install Tcl. You can get it here. I had to do this recently, although for a somewhat different problem and it worked out for me. By the way, I am also running 10.6.8, so it would seem that the natively installed Tcl was deprecated for my/your purposes.   <answer44270> Try cleaning, then upgrading all of your installed packages prior to building meld:  precodesudo port clean all sudo port selfupdate sudo port upgrade outdated sudo port selfupdate # just to make sure... sudo port install meld /code/pre  <comment38314> Have you tried `To report a bug, see http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets ` <comment38368> I have not.  You think its a macport bug or just misconfiguration on my machine?  I'll take a walk over there and see what I can see. <comment38374> I think that Tcl is part of the Apple install - but I am on Lion so cannot tell exactly. <comment38379> Ah, yes, lookie here:  MacPorts bug from a couple of months ago.  Does not appear to have been acted on:  https://trac.macports.org/ticket/31607 <comment38381> Did you try the `port clean libgnomei` as suggested <comment38382> Actually, my case may be different:  https://trac.macports.org/ticket/32527 <comment38384> I have tried the clean, same result.  THanks <comment46323> Well, this does not answer the question but, if the goal is to install [Meld merge tool](http://meldmerge.org/), I don't really see its advantages over FileMergeâ€¦? <comment50616> Hey.  This worked to get it installed.  That is the good news.  The bad news is that it now won't run.  Something about "...ValueError: image should be a GdkPixbuf or empty".   This is progress none-the-less!
