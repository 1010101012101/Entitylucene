How to switch select between buttons using only keyboard <body> I am trying to keep my fingers on the keyboard as much as possible and would like to be completely mouse-free in some applications, such as codeSublime Text/code.  E.g., I can initiate a file opening or closing using just the keyboard but I do not know how to navigate close or open file dialogs using the keyboard alone.  More specifically, how do I switch between selected buttons?  E.g. tabbing works in other OSs I am familiar with (e.g. Windows and Linux KDE) but here I cannot tab between Save and Cancel buttons when I want to close a file.  <answer101028> Using the tab key between save and cancel buttons works for OS X too. You only have to enable it:  ol liGo to System Preferences/li liGo To Keyboard/li liGo to the tab Keyboard Short/li liOn the bottom of the window, set the radio button to "All controls":/li /ol  img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24087/Schermafbeelding%202013-09-05%20om%2020.01.34.png" alt="Full Keyboard Access"  From now on, when you see a OK/Cancel window the OK button is blue and can be pressed using the return key, and the cancel button has a outline which can be pressed using the space bar:  img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24087/Schermafbeelding%202013-09-05%20om%2020.07.37.png" alt="Demo"  But the real trick is: You are now able to press the tab key to move the outline to another button and hit the space bar to press the highlighted button.  <answer101044> A common shortcut for a Cancel button is kbdCmd/kbdkbd./kbd. (i.e. Command and period a.k.a. full stop).  <answer226277> Sublime Text 3 (OSX 10.10.5)  codeEnter/code = select highlighted option (e.g. "Open", "Save"...)  codeEsc/code = cancel dialog  codeCmd+D/code = select alternate (outlined) option (e.g. "Don't Save"...)   <comment118933> I did that I am able to shift selection but when I am on the "Do Not Save' button (i.e. when the button has a highlighted outline like your 'Annuleer'), the fully outlined button is still 'Save' so if I hit kbdReturn/kbd it still goes to Save <comment118934> Yes, the button pressed using the return key will always be the Save button in your case; you can't change which button is pressed using the return key. But you can press other buttons using tab and the space bar. <comment118937> that is kindof awkward but it worked <comment118966> You can often, but not always, use Cmd+[initial] to hit buttons. For example, if you close an unsaved file and are offered "Save" and "Don't Save," you can hit Cmd+S to save and Cmd+D for don't save. Works in most cases, AFAIK. <comment118975> Alternatively, if you prefer to keep you `Tab` behave normally and would like it to select *All Controls*, then you can just press `Alt+Tab`. Most of times you don’t want `Tab` navigate through all the button on screen. <comment199569> The command I see here is not Apple Period as intended, but Apple Hyphen. <comment199570> More commonly : `Esc`. <comment199595> @sayzlim — Your comment is contradictory. As for pressing Option Tab (Alt Tab), this does not navigate between buttons.
