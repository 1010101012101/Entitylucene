Diskutility showed me 15 GB free space before the deletion of Dropbox Directory. I restarted my system many times to see if the case is really true. After removing Dropbox directory, I got 50 GB free space as I should. Dropbox is clearly messing up the filesystem more than many know.

Surprising changes in filesystem. <comment294793> See http://owncloud.org as well <comment294796> @CousinCocaine Great! It would be great to get your review about it. I really need local storage. I keep cloud storage unsafe. I do not understand the technologies behind owncloud.org. Is it a company or organization? <comment294797> This comment section is not the correct place to discus this, but see owncloud as an opensource alternative to dropbox. You can host your own files for free. Do your research on google if it sounds interesting. <comment294860> If user land applications without special privileges can cause such file system corruptions, you should not blame the application, but the file system. HFS+ (Journaled) is not that broken _by design_, so if Dropbox seem to manage to hurt it, there is either a misunderstanding, or it's been broken before. <comment295074> @MaxRied I am not claiming anyone. I just say that Dropbox is not sufficient for my tasks anymore. There are many other things in Dropbox that are not documented etc and where the support/developers are not willing to answer because it is proprietary software. Their customer service is also very bad, very low response rate, although I pay them 200 euros every year. It is my time to move to owncloud.
