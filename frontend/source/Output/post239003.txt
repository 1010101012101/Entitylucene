Automator task to open screenshots in Preview automatically <body> I'm pretty new to Automator but it seems like it's possible - I just can't seem to get it to work.  I'd like to be able to take a screenshot and then open it up in Preview for easy annotation. emIf it's possible I'd then like to copy it to clipboard after saving but that's not 100% needed./em  I've tried following a few articles but never received good results. The one that got me closest is here: https://andytaylor.me/2014/05/22/better-os-x-screenshots-with-shell-scripts/  I don't need Dropbox so I edited that part out and I modified it based on some other suggestions - here's what I have:  precodedirectoryname="Screenshots" filename="shot_$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S').png" path="$HOME/Pictures/$directoryname/" mkdir -p "$path" screencapture -o -i "$path$filename" open -a 'Preview' "$path$filename" /code/pre  When I run the Automator task it says that it was completed successfully but it just opens up Preview, it doesn't even allow me to do a screencapture. When I copy/paste into Terminal it hangs on the last line - but successfully allows me to do the screencapture.   <answer239004> @Feanux I was answering your question and then you deleted it but I see you reposted it, anyway I have made a Automator app that does this and will attach a screenshot (that was taken by Automator).img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wmlF2.jpg" alt="enter image description here" As you can see it takes two screenshots, one for clipboard and one for preview/save  h2UPDATE:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHtGy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment293197> Since they're interactive screenshots it prompts me to just take 2 screenshots automatically and doesn't open Preview :( <comment293201> I'm uploading a screen capture of this working, give me a sec... <comment293202> http://www.mediafire.com/download/13mzxw87b22zp2k/screen.mov <comment293204> Did it work for you? If so could you mark my question as correct :) <comment293205> Works great if I want to do a fullscreen screenshot but I need to make it interactive to be choose the selection. Changing the "Type" to Interactive means I now have to take the screenshot twice and choose the same selection both times. <comment293206> I'll have a try at changing it give me a moment :) <comment293212> Is this better? <comment293218> Looks great! I think that will work, didn't think it would be that simple. Thanks again. <comment293219> No worries, I've taught my self all this with **minor** help from Google, so it's always good to share my knowledge and I expanded on it a bit too (never used the screenshot task before or the preview one) <comment293240> Is there a way to get rid of that confirmation pop-up? When executing the workflow always states "Please select an area to take a screen shot." <comment293265> I'll try, no promises since I just woke up
