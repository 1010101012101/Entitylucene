I can't find a setting to disable WINS in Network settings <body> In my Network settings under WINS I have the NetBios name (elly) that I would like to disable (kill).  The message shows that the "elly"is currently been used ?  By whom, for what ?  There a bunch of messages in the Console with for example elly.local WindowServer ?? what server ? I do not have one ?  My search on Google and here did not help.  I tried deleting the NetBios name, but it comes back!  Also tried the without success!  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.netbiosd.plist /code/pre  I have no local network, nor any workgroup set up, just a lone wifi connection to the world.  Running Hostname in Terminal shows "Elly.Local"  I would not mind using Terminal to kill it, but I'm just wondering whether there's any UI-based way to just turn off all of this stuff. I am not a big fan of running services I'm not using.   MBA 10.8.4  <answer103882> I didn't find any way through the GUI (on Snow Leopard, Lion &amp; Mountain Lion).  On the other hand the following receipe is stopping codenetbiosd/code. In a codeTerminal/code or an codexterm/code type:pre % ps ax | grep [/]netbios   122   ??  SNs    1:52.41 /usr/sbin/netbiosd % /usr/bin/sudo launchctl unload -w /System/LibraryLaunchDaemons/com.apple.netbiosd.plist Password: høt∫tuƒƒ % ps ax | grep [/]netbios % /pre  The second codeps/code command shouldn't output anything. This is normal and means that there isn't anymore any codenetbiosd/code running.  Another way to check that codenetbiosd/code isn't anymore chating continuously on all your network interfaces is to use codetcpdump/code for a full 5 minutes:  pre % /usr/bin/sudo tcpdump -i en0 host elly.local udp port netbios-ns [...] ^C 0 packets captured nnnnnn packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel % /usr/bin/sudo tcpdump -i en1 host elly.local udp port netbios-ns [...] ^C 0 packets captured mmmmmm packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel % /pre  These 2 commands should say exactly code0 packets captured/code otherwise something is leaking.  <comment116067> Added the flag Security, because being concerned not to run services you don't control is a plain legitimate security improvment. <comment117123> I don't have an answer yet for your query, but I did want to clarify something. In your question, you reference WindowServer as if it is a Microsoft Windows Server, it appears. However, WindowServer is an element of OS X (AppKit, HIToolbox, etc.) See link below for more about WindowServer.  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003794-CH1-SUBSECTION14 <comment122325> Thanks, will try it and let you know :) <comment181689> If with time and experience increasing you find any nicer way, please post it. I'm interested too :). <comment329668> This worked for macOS Sierra: `sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.netbiosd.plist` <comment329720> → bassplayer7: thank you for this validation on actual version :).
