Have touchbar show vol up, vol down, brightness up, brightness down buttons by default <body> How can I make my touch bar ALWAYS show the Volume Down, Volume Up, Brightness Down, Brightness Up buttons?  I absolutely hate having to touch the button, look down at the slider, and try to drag it into the right position.   Is it possible for me just to show these controls by default (basically the old keyboard layout)?  <answer286138> If you don't need the application-specific touch bar controls, you can configure it to always show the expanded control strip   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aoq6t.png" alt="Expanded Control Strip"  Otherwise, you could try configuring something in BetterTouchTool  <answer286144> Yes, you can go into System Preferences and set the default view for the Touch bar.  ol liOpen the System Preferences app./li liSelect the Keyboard option (second row, third item)/li liOn the first tab (also called Keyboard), locate the dropdown for "Touch Bar shows" and choose "Expanded Control Strip"./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9oQCr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer286241> If you're interested in further customization of your Touch Bar, I'd recommend trying out strongBetterTouchTool (BTT)/strong.  You can add additional controllers, app icons, and actions to your Touch Bar (in addition to keyboard, trackpad, and mouse customizations too).  Their licenses are reasonably priced and they offer things like student discounts, which is actually how I obtained their software.
