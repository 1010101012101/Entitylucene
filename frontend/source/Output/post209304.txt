Scheduled start up with bootcamp <body> I'm trying to run a scheduled startup on mac minis running windows via bootcamp.    IF the computers are shutdown from the mac partition, the auto start will happen.  IF the computers are shutdown from the windows partition, they will not auto start.  Any ideas on how to get the auto startup when I turn off from the Windows partition?  Thanks!
