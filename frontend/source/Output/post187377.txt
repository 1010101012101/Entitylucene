Tone synch says library linked to another library on my computer <body> my iphone 4 cannot find a purchased ringtone in itunes on my computer.  When I try to access synch a tone to my phone the message is that my iphone is already linked to another library on my laptop and wants to delete that library.  How do I handle this?  <comment221522> iTunes is the master, the phone is the slave. The phone will only sync correctly to one account; any try other & it will be wiped & replaced with that one <comment221716> I understand that but your answer does not address my question.  Let me rephrase it. The phone will not access the library it is 'linked' to for the purpose of accessing new ringtone.  How can I resolve this? <comment221720> Your clarification is more confusing than your original question. I really have no clue, sorry.
