The camera lens on iPod touch 5th gen <body> My iPhone 6 camera protrudes slightly and so does my iPod touch 5th gen, but I don't worry about scratching my iPhone camera because I know it's coated in sapphire. Is the iPod touch protruding camera also sapphire? Or is it just the same glass as the screen?  <answer171094> The iPod touch 5 is older then the iPhone 6 (released with the iPhone 5) so no, it does not have a sapphire coating. However, it generally is durable enough for most things before it scratches.   <comment201293> Isn't iPhone 5 camera also made of sapphire lens? <comment201294> @Moist No. The sapphire lens were new, beginning with the iPhone 6.
