Office 2016 Syncing Exchange Global Address List (GAL) to Contacts <body> Have just started a new role where the company uses Exchange, after many years on Google Apps, and have been given Office 2016 for Mac. I want to use a different third party mail app such as Spark but the lack of support for the GAL lookup means I have to open Outlook quite often to search names and email addresses.  My solution to this, and one that is easily achievable on Windows, would be to copy the GAL to my Outlook Contacts and sync with Mac Contacts so that Spark can pull from there but there seems to be a big design flaw with Outlook 2016 for Mac whereby you cannot copy all GAL Contacts but only search one by one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JKKOf.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FW9pm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone have or know of a good solution to this problem? Other than getting a Windows based colleague to export the GAL to me in a flat file but that will quickly be out of date as colleagues come and go.
