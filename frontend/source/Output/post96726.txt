Alternative Ways to Control The Volume Level Of My Mac In OS X? <body> Generally to either increase or decrease the volume level of my Mac, I always go to the volume menu bar and adjust the slider accordingly.  I was wondering:  What other ways exist within OS X to adjust volume settings and perhaps give even finer adjustments to the volume level that is produced ?  <answer96728> ul liUse the volume keys on your keyboard (hold Shift + Option for finer control)/li liGo to the Sound pane of System Preferences/li /ul  <answer124496> You mentioned alternate ways to control the volume. Here is one from the terminal:  precodesudo osascript -e "set Volume 5" /code/pre  You can change to "5" to a higher or lower number to make the volume go up and down in intensity.  precodesudo osascript -e "set Volume 0.1" /code/pre  This will put your volume at super quiet  As @Tortilla stated, for finer control without the terminal, you can hold Shift + Option while using the F11 or F12 keys to adjust the volume by 1/4 (0.25) increments.  <comment113543> The volume keys are F11 & F12, is that correct ? <comment113544> Yes, I believe so. <comment113545> Excellent, thanks very much :) <comment292478> I have no more volume on my mac os x vers 10.5.8,maybe the drivers are missing???
