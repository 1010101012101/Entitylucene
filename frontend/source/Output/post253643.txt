Download photos from potential stacked exchange <body> There are two phones showing up on my iPhone. If I go to Settings  General  Storage &amp; iCloud Usage, it lists two phones, mine and another one below it. I have only one phone and to my knowledge I'm not linked to anyone else's.    I read a response that it may possibly be a stacked exchange.   How do I at least get my photos off of that backup before deleting?
