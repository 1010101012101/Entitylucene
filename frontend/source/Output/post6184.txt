How can I switch option (alt) and command (windows) keys for Windows 7 in Boot Camp? <body> Installed Windows 7 via Bootcamp for some work-related projects. I've also installed the Apple Bootcamp drivers from the OS X install disk and updated to the latest version. It mapped all my keys just fine, but I was surprised it does not offer an option to switch the mappings of kbdAlt/kbd and kbdWindows/kbd keys; ie. kbdAlt/kbd is left of kbdSpacebar/kbd, kbdWindows/kbd key is left of kbdAlt/kbd.  The current way directly maps to the physical keyboard layout, but not to the way people are used to working: e.g. OS X's kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd for window switching is equivelant to kbdAlt/kbd+kbdTab/kbd not kbdWindows/kbd+kbdTab/kbd. I keep hitting the wrong keys because of muscle memory. :)  Is there a built-in way to remap kbdWindows/kbd and kbdAlt/kbd keys? If not, what 3rd party app is the best way to do this?  <answer6359> I had this issue.  Resolved it using Sharp Keys (free).   ul lihttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/map-any-key-to-any-key-on-windows-xp-vista//li /ul  <answer105485> I've been using AutoHotKey for about a year on Win7 Ultimate x64. Works great.   In addition to swapping the left Command and Option keys, I've remapped the right Command to forward delete, and right Option to "AppsKey" (aka, context menu) which helps in Visual Studio and other apps.  If you want function keys to work as, well, function keys (without having to hold down Fn), you can set that in the Bootcamp application via the system tray icon.  Here's a script just for swapping left Option (alt) and Command (Windows):  precodeRAlt::AppsKey ; right-Option to context menu RWin::Del ; right command to forward delete LWin::LAlt ; left command to alt LAlt::LWin ; left alt to command (windows key) /code/pre  You may also consider remapping Caps Lock if you need an additional key since, really, how often do any of us use Caps Lock?   <answer239631> I would like to share a trick that you can remap some less used keys to keys you prefer. E.g. I map right CMD to DEL and right ALT to menu('application'), using Sharpkeys  <answer255071> Here is a script file for the Apple keyboard with F hotkeys and CMD hotkeys too. https://github.com/stroebjo/autohotkey-windows-mac-keyboard  <comment6484> This seems like a Windows question - maybe it should be migrated to Super User? <comment42231> Didn't work for me (Windows 7 64bit) <comment138961> Nice, especially since I already use AutoHotkey for a lot of other stuff, but bothersome because I switch between a "real" Windows keyboard and my Apple keyboard. <comment138981> @Jan I feel your pain. Having to start and stop AutoHotkey when docking is annoying. At least there's the system try icon. <comment139025> No, I mean I have a general AutoHotkey script that I'd have to have two versions of, or figure out if there's some identifier that AutoHotkey can use for an 'if' section. Gotta love AHK though. <comment139027> @Jan Ahhh... that makes more sense. <comment282203> Also did not work for me on W7 64 bit. Alt is not available to be remapped. <comment285724> It works for me with Windows 10 64bit, make sure you have to logoff and login again after applying the configuration (Sharp Keys has told you to logoff! ) Besides, for the Alt button, although it is not detected by the "Type Key", you can still select if manually from the menu, I am swapping Alt and Command button and it works on my MBA 2012.
