Java 7 JRE Not Detected on Clean Install of Mountain Lion <body> I know there similar questions on how to enable the Java 7 JRE on Mountain Lion when Apple's Java 6 JRE is installed as well.  But I just did a clean install of Mountain Lion, installed Java 7 JRE - not Java 7 JDK - and it is not being detected.  I see the Java icon in System Preferences. But Java applications are still prompting for a Java 6 installation from Mountain Lion. And running "strongjava -version/strong" from the command line also does the same.  Oracle's instructions seem to say that I do not need to do anything further then simply installing the JRE. And online tutorials I read also suggest the same.  Does anyone have an idea why this is?  <answer65677> In Oracle's JRE 7 for Mac installation instructions, it states:     Installing a JRE from Oracle will not:      ul   liUpdate java -version symlinks or add java to your path. /li   liShow the installed JRE in the Java Preferences.app /li   /ul      To be able to do the above,     you need to install the JDK.   After installing the JDK, go to Applications  Utilities  Java Preferences.app and drag Java SE 7 to the top to indicate that it is preferred.  You may also switch off Java SE 6 entirely without uninstalling it.  <answer90345> Uninstall java by revo and go to control panal and java and settings and deleted files. then click ok.and restart computer then install java again from java.com  <comment77264> Unbelievable that I missed that! I installed JDK and it worked. Thank you so much for your help. <comment91517> Good question! I just faced the same issue with a fresh Lion + JRE7. Thanks! +1 <comment106045> Java is not installed (well /usr/bin/java) is not - the one the OP installed is just for Java applets
