Yosemite won't uncompress .zip files when I double-click on them <body> I recently upgraded to Yosemite (10.10.1). Today I tried to unzip a .zip file for the first time since upgrading.   I already had 4 or so unzipping apps that worked just fine on my previous OS X, so I just double-clicked on the .zip, and Yosemite tried to open the .zip with the default unzip app.   Unfortunately, I then discovered that the default unzip app and all of my other ones were not compatible with 10.10.  I checked online and found that according to Apple, in 10.10, to unzip a .zip, you just double-click on the file and Yosemite would unzip it for you.  However, whenever I double-clicked on the .zip, Yosemite would only try to open it with the incompatible default unzip app.   So I deleted all my unzip apps and rebooted.  When I then checked my .zip files, I noticed they all were defaulting to open with TextEdit. When I double-clicked one .zip file, I got this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMaJi.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I double-clicked another .zip file, I got this message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iZ4H6.png" alt="enter image description here"  So the question is does anyone know how to get Yosemite to open a .zip given this situation?  <answer234878> I just had the same problem - usually the double click works but for some reason it didn't work on a zipped mp4 video.  What worked was to right-click and choose 'open with'  'archive utility'.  <comment186857> Right-click on one, choose Get Info and change the application listed under "Open With", then click the Change All button. <comment252514> Select one of your `.zip` archive, type `⌘I`, and include a screen capture within your question. <comment252537> I have this same problem! I actually compressed by right clicking on a file, then attempted to open the .zip just created, and yosemite failed to do so. When I clicked, "search app store" it told me that "You can’t open the application “App Store.app” because PowerPC applications are no longer supported." What's up with that? <comment304679> What happens if you run `unzip archive.zip` in the Terminal?
