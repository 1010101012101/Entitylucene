How to send email from OS X command line <body> Dozens of tutorials followed and nothing works.  codemsmtp/code doesn't work ("TLS certificate verification failed: unable to get local issuer certificate" (cert installed)  codepostfix/code doesn't work (no way to specify codefrom/code address)  codeaws ses/code doesn't work (unverified email (that's verified))  codemutt/code and codemailx/code tried every combination with the above.  Comcast and Gmail services tried with the above...  Assuming a bone clean install of El Capitan with Homebrew. Blue sky, spare no expense (I'll buy a service that actually works at this point.)  I need to send an email from the command line.  <answer216339> Sendemail works great with Gmail and all other SMTP servers I have ever tried:  precodebrew update brew install sendemail man sendemail /code/pre  strongEdit:/strong Thanks for the edit/link/clarification, @patrick.  I also wanted to clarify that I have always used codesendemail/code flawlessly on Debian-based systems, but encountered TLS error after upgrading from OS X Mountain Lion to Mavericks when Mavericks was first released.  I don't recall if I even tried to uninstall/re-install from a "Mavericks bottle", but I believe the problem actually had to do with Google updating their accepted handshake protocols or whatnot around this time.  The fix was easily-found by Googling and involved editing a line in the codesendemail/code config to [I believe] remove a reference to SSL and replace it with TLS 1.1 (or something of the sort).  I'm sure codesendemail/code itself has been upgraded since then to account for this, because I believe I have used it successfully since then on both OS X Yosemite and El Capitan with Gmail without having to make any weird modifications to the configuration.  It truly is a great program, and I cannot give it enough praises.  If any of you are familiar with codeblat/code for Windows, codesendemail/code is like that, except much more powerful and very easy to use.  <comment261385> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12387/how-to-send-an-email-from-command-line?rq=1
