A and V keys not working on wireless keyboard and cannot connect original to iMac now <body> I have hardly used my wireless keyboard and all of a sudden the kbdA/kbd and kbdV/kbd keys aren't working.  I have taken off the keys but there is no dust or grime at all.  When i have tried to use the old original keyboard, it wont play ball. I have disconnected the blue tooth, restarted it a dozen times just to try and get it to recognize that keyboard alone but to no avail.  <comment372276> "wont play ball" isn't very descriptive. Please fill in some details - precisely what Mac, what keyboard models, OS version... etc <comment372286> Your wireless keyboard failed - time to get a new one.  As for your "original"  keyboard, is it Bluetooth or USB?  How have you tried connecting it?  Have you tried a generic USB (wired) keyboard?  Please **edit** your original question with the details requested.
