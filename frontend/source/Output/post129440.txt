Keyboard shortcut: shift+tab in chrome does wrong thing <body> I'm a new mac user really (emreally/em) struggling to learn the mac keyboard shortcuts.  One that is just killing me right now is navigating forms in Chrome.  Say I hit codeTab/code to go to the next element in a form.  When i hit codeShift+Tab/code to try to return to that element, instead of going back up the form, Chrome navigates to the previous tab.  How do I fix this?  My strong preference is for codeShift-Tab/code to simply reverse-navigate the form - that is pretty standard behavior..  <answer129464> As a workaround, or just to check whether the problem is with Google Chrome or something else, install this extension.  To configure it to go to the last input, type in kbdShift/kbd + KbdTab/kbd in emShortcut Key/em and as the emAction/em, click Browser Action  Inner Page Action  Focus on the previous input element.  You could also try Reset Browser Settings and then try going back in a form in Incognito Mode - kbd&#8984;/kbd+KBDShift/KBD+KBDN/KBD  <answer129468> They work for me. Out of curiosity, under the Window menu, what is the keyboard shortcut for "Select Next Tab" and "Select Previous Tab"?  strongEdit/strong (because I'm an idiot and misused SO): If they aren't kbd⌥ + ⌘ + →/kbd and kbd⌥ + ⌘ + ←/kbd, then something's wrong. Check System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts and see if they've been redefined there; otherwise, perhaps one of your extensions hijacked kbd⇧ + &lt;tab&gt;/kbd?  <comment151487> Does Tab forward work correctly? Can you Tab and Shift+Tab in safari, or firefox? <comment151501> Yeah, I can tab forward and Shift+Tab backward in firefox. <comment151822> Sweet.  Shortcut Manager did the trick nicely. Still seems weird that I needed an extension for that, but so be it. I suspect I'll get more use out of that extension in the future too.
