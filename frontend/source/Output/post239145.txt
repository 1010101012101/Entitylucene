Focus on address bar in Safari <body> A few days ago i noticed, that in new tab cursor doesn't set on address/search bar. Now I use kbd⌘+L/kbd combination to quickly switch, but it isn't comfortably for long time use.   Reflecting on the causes of such behavior , I found that the cursor stands on a search tab in the strongprivate tab/strong.  What i tried to do to fix it:  ol liSet in general preferences parameter emOpen new tabs/windows with/em  Empty page/li liTurn off all extensions/li /ol  I have OSX 10.11.5 with Safari 9.1.1 em(and also i have the same problem on Safari Technology Preview 9.1.1)/em  hr  h2Example:/h2  Open new window img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/odHA8.png" alt="enter image description here"  Press combination kbdcmd+T/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/plYtX.png" alt="enter image description here"  But when I do same actions in private window cursor has already focused on address bar. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LpfsK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer239278> There was no updates installed for Safari or for OS X, but now tabs opens with focused address bar.  I have cleared Safari's history and cookies, but it does not help at that time. I think it just elusive bug, because now I can't repeat it. I have only one decision - wait when OS X remove this bug itself.  <answer239758> Try Safari/Preferences/Search and uncheck Include Safari Suggestions.  <comment293399> Your question is a bit unclear - are you saying when you open a new tab you would like it to immediately focus on the address bar? <comment293401> @TimMalone Yes. I always open a new tab by cmd+T  and start typing query or name of site. But now between this two process necessary use cmd+L. In private tab works well without additional actions. Maybe I knocked out some important settings or collied with issue in safari or osx. <comment293409> Have you tried going to the Safari menu? Menu Bar  History  Clear History...  Select 'Clear all history'  Clear history. Be sure to make a backup of your computer if you want to save _any_ of your Safari files. <comment293433> @Brick Yeah, but same result. I tried to install  Safari Technology Preview and again I have the same result. I think it's little specific bug that difficult to repeat and catch. Thanks for your comments <comment293849> Did you completely close Safari (⌘+Q) before the problem resolved itself? When you close your last tab, Safari stays open, just without a window. Quitting the app often resolves issues such as that one. <comment293867> I always use kbd⌘+Q/kbd when want to close Safari. It's funny, but after  yesterday's answer I have met three times this bug. Still searching what app or action leads to this bug. Thanks for your comment @Phong <comment294573> Thanks for your answer. I was waiting when bug comes again, and your solution is work. But i can't understand why this bug is shows itself randomly when this settings is checked.
