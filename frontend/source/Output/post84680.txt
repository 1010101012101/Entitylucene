Macbook Pro changing desktop picture randomly <body> I just got back from vacation and while on vacation I turned my computer off for the 5 days I was gone. I just now turned it back on and my desktop picture was changed to the galaxy photo which I know I didn't do because it was a picture of my dog when I left. It was locked in my basement so I know that no one could be messing with me. I also have noticed that my computer is running a little slow, but I don't know if that has anything to do with it? Also I know there is a setting that you can choose to have it change your picture every 30 min. or so, but I checked and that wasn't the problem for desktop 1 or desktop 2.  How can I prevent this happening in the future? Or this an indication of a "deeper" problem?  <answer259223> We have seen this on occasion.  Our solution has been to:  ol ligo to Desktop &amp; ScreenSaver (AppleSystem Preferences) /li liChoose a different photo (or folder)/li liChange the "CHange Picture" time to something different./li liCHange back both ("change picture" time and photo) to original settings./li liclose Preferences tab../li /ol  The theory we hold is that the preferences are sometimes getting corrupted, and over-writing/re-writing is fixing it....  <comment97501> Is your dog photo still in the same place? <comment97502> Yes, it is still in my IPhoto Library. <comment97532> Are you sure you didn't login with a different user? or the guest account? <comment97909> Yes, I am sure.
