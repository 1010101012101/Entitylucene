How do Wi-Fi networks persist between installs? <body> I've just done a reinstall from the recovery partition and have found that all the previously known Wi-Fi networks have persisted, even though I formatted the main partition during the reinstall.  How are they still here?  <answer258116> They are synchronised over iCloud, so if you log in to iCloud the list of networks and their associated passwords are added to macOS.  <comment322589> Ah! That makes sense. Thanks for the (incredibly) speedy reply! <comment322646> If you have an iDevice, they'll also by synced across devices. E.g. my iPad automatically logs into all networks I have previously logged into with my laptop.
