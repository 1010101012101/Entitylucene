How do I calibrate an Apple TV Display? <body> I am familiar with using the Display Calibration Assistant.  I have used it on other external monitors before.  Connected to my living room TV via AirPlay using Apple TV.  The colors are all off.  When I open the displays menu, I am able to open the calibration assistant for the built in display, but not my external Apple TV display.  I can see other profiles for other external monitors, but I cannot select them. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SAL76.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer215104> I use the THX tune up app on iOS to calibrate my AppleTV over airplay. I've not found a way to get OS X to calibrate things further, but to my eyes, this workaround has been good enough with default settings on OS X.  <answer219066> I use the Calibr8 app for tvOS, which comes with guided instructions and HD.709 professional-grade test patterns.  NB It's not possible to apply colour profile to the device, so you'll need to tweak the settings on your TV to apply any changes.  <answer283215> I like HD Test Patterns for its simplicity and good instructions.  <comment259804> I forgot that it's the color profile of my TV is managed by the TV itself <comment357038> Welcome to Ask Different!
