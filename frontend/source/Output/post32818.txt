How should I prep a laptop for a return? <body> I'm returning a Macbook Air I purchased last week at an Apple Store (not because I don't like it, I just need a bit more screen real estate) and I want to make sure I put it in an acceptable state. I'd like to remove all the data that I've put on it in the last week but I don't want to go overboard.  Should I format the drive and return it with no OS? Format and reinstall the OS? Leave it as-is and trust Apple refurb to not look at my data?  <answer32819> If you're pressed for time, and since you mentioned the Macbook Air was new and purchased last week, it probably was installed with OS X Lion which has full-disk encryption. If this assumption is true, then  ol liBack up your data. I'd recommend using Time Machine (so you don't have to re-setup your user id, install apps, etc)./li licreate another "throwaway" admin id, and log in to your "throwaway" admin id/li liand delete yourself from the Mac using System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups preference pane./li /ol  <answer32829> Wipe the disk. The apples will sure reinstall the OS.  <comment37517> New MacBook Airs don't come with an installation thumb drive. <comment37519> Thanks Daniel for the heads-up, I've removed the erroneous info and updated my answer. <comment37527> You can return something just because it isn't exactly what you wanted??!! <comment37538> How would you wipe the disk? <comment37556> Yes, Apple gives you 14 days to return something just because you changed your mind. It has to be in like-new condition with all parts and box, etc. <comment37557> Nomad has it, this is what Apple will tell you to do. No need to format HD, just back up your stuff, make a new user account (Apple had me call it "admin" with password "admin"), log into said account, delete yours. Put a posit note on the box telling Apple the account name and password and you're set. <comment37583> http://www.dban.org <comment37658> @Richard More than 14 days during the holidays. <comment38036> I used this method. The Apple Store folks had no problem with it.
