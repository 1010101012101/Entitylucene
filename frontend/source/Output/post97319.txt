Shortcut iPhone/iPad app to send email to a specific address? <body> I send lots of emails to a small number of people.  Rather than having to send emails to them through the native Mail app, I'd like to have an app that I can "click" on that automatically has a specific address already filled in and seeks only a subject and message-contents.    I'd like to have three of these, each doing the same thing, but going to different email addresses.  I've never written an iOS app and don't feel like learning how, but I haven't yet found a way to either create forms or encapsulate macros or other paths to doing what I want.  I've tried doing this by navigating to a webmail "send email" screen via the Safari browser, filling in the emTo/em field, and then saving it as a shortcut, but when clicked on the screen appears without the email.  Any other ideas?  <answer97346> There are at least two apps which support something like this:  ul liDrafts  Note application with the ability to define actions for these notes based on the standard URL scheme. Sending mails to pre-defined addresses is easily possible/li liLaunchCenter Pro  Quick starter for apps, using URLs as well. Using an URL with the mail recipient included will open Mail with an empty mail already addressed correctly./li /ul  <comment114324> This got me thinking.  I created a web page whose contents were a redirect to a mailto URL.  I loaded that page in safari and then saved it to the home screen and voila, I got what I needed.  Thanks for sparking the inspiration for solving this!
