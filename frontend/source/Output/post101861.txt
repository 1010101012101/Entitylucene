iPhone different usage after restore <body> I backed up my iPhone 5 to iCloud and then restored it. Now it has about 2 GB more free space than it did previously. The restore has completely finished (I can back up to iCloud again now, wouldn't let me while restoring it.)  All my photos and apps seem to be in place. I have over 3,000 photos so I can't verify them individually, but they seem to all be there. I've also done a full sync with iTunes, so my non-iTunes-purchased content is also back on the phone.  What could cause this discrepancy? I'm worried some of my stuff is missing, there's just too much for me to remember everything.  <comment120006> When you did the back up, what did you back up ? Previous purchases may not be restored if they are no longer in the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBooks Store. <comment120626> @Buscarì›ƒ Hmm....missing apps would make sense, if that's what it is. I'm guessing there's no way to check what's missing at this point though...
