Many GUI Programs suddenly not appearing on El Capitan <body> I was adjusting Accessibility options and then empoof/em the following programs disappeared from view.  ul liFinder/li liGoogle Chrome/li liAtom (editor)/li liOpera/li /ul  Safari is the only guy still working. Note: the processes for Chrome, Atom, Opera are still there: but the GUI's can not be shown.  I have checked in other spaces: there are no apps in the other space.  I also logged off and even restarted the computer: same behavior.  I reset the accessibility settings. No dice. What might be going on?  <answer267076> The issue was I had inadverently had both VGA and HDMI connections from the mac to the same monitor. It was actually working fine until I twiddled with the accessibility options.   Now why it is that the accessibility changes caused some programs to decide to migrate to the unviewable display?  Not sure..  <comment335008> Which Accessibility options did you change and how? <comment335014> maybe you had fullscreen apps that were migrated to unviewable display
