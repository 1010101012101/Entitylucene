Issue with installation of FFMPEG and Homebrew due to low HDD size? <body> I hope this is the right place to pose this question. I have a MacBook Pro with just 128 GB of HDD space.   Now I want to install Homebrew &amp; FFMPEG - however, with what I have read it seems that Xcode is a mandatory.   Is there a way to install just the required libraries for FFMPEG or Homebrew to run without having install the enormous 10-12 gig of Xcode.   Thanks.   <answer274443> On my system the necessary Command Line Tools take up some 303.6MB (I am using macOS Sierra 10.12.3 on a 2012 AirBook). Also, for what it is worth /Applications/XCode.app is only ~6+GB on this same computer.

Only a handful of _formulae_ require a full Xcode installation and most only need the Command Line Tools installed. On a separate note: There are precompiled binaries for FFmpeg and do not require Homebrew  or Xcode to use. <comment345195> Thanks! I'm definitely going to give this a try. I couldn't appreciate more.
