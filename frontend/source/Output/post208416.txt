Adding a directory to $PATH doesn't work in Yosemite <body> I've tried to do it both ways:  1. I edited code~/.bash_profile/code like so:  precode$ cat ~/.bash_profile export PATH="${PATH};~/bin" $ $ ls -l ~/.bash_profile  -rw-r--r--  1 myuser  staff  202 Oct  1 16:57 /Users/myuser/.bash_profile /code/pre  2. I edited code/etc/paths/code like so:  precode$ cat /etc/paths /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /Users/myuser/bin /code/pre  So now my path looks like this:  precode$ echo $PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/myuser/bin;~/bin /code/pre  But I still can't run the files I have in code~/bin/code:  precode$ ls -l ~/bin total 8 -rwxr-xr-x  1 myuser  staff  38 Oct  1 13:44 dev $ dev bash: dev: command not found /code/pre  I haven't restarted my Mac yet, but I opened a new terminal to do the above test. How can I get the files in code~/bin/code to work without having to type their full path?  <comment251378> I just did this, and It worked fine for me. I used `~/bin` in my `/etc/paths` instead of my username. <comment251379> You have a typo there is a semi colon (not colon) in your path just before ~/bin  - which is from your ~/.bash_profile - you have not tried the  /etc/paths on its own <comment251401> @IronCraftMan: Yup. You can put that as the answer.
