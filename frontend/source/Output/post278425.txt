Random shutdown after minutes for macbook pro 15" 2014 <body> I'm having this problem driving me crazy since some days.  My macbook just turns off after around 1 minute of being logged in.  ul liI reset completely macOS thinking it would be a Software Issue but nothing./li liI though it was an hardware issue but if I use the guest safari mode it doesn't happend, or also if I install the OS in recovery (which lasts 40 mins or more) I have no shutdowns... so can it be hardware?/li liCPU temp and fans are ok, same with battery./li liBluetooth and WIFI are turned off thinking it was a driver problem, but nothing/li liNo useful logs in console and all ok running hardware test/li liReset SMC and PRAM/li /ul  Here's the latest logs before shutdown: https://gist.github.com/dariobanfi/6464faed360005041d9cc1a6895c1712  I am getting crazy... any idea what could cause this??  <answer278431> It's not clear to me what emI reset completely macOS/em means? However, the first two things I'd do now are testing to see what happens in Safe Mode and to also reset the System Management Controller.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps boot your MBP into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liUse the computer for a while and take note of what happens (i.e. is the issue still present, etc)/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li liOnce you've booted normally again use the computer for a while and take note of what happens (i.e. is the issue still present, etc)/li /ol  strongReset the SMC/strong  If the issue is still present I would reset the SMC. For your particular MBP, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Let me know how things went after doing each of the above.  <answer280634> The problem was caused by some unknown hardware problem. Logic board and display have been changed but the problem still persisted. Apple Store gave me a new laptop at the end.  <comment350352> You say, "no useful logs in console". Does that mean that there are no kernel panic or MacOS crash reports? There should at least be a shutdown report. Can you edit your question to post the System log information for one of these shutdown/startup iterations? <comment350371> NoahL I posted the logs from system.log, I can't see any insightful error message but let me know if you do. No panic/crash report errors when I turn on again <comment350372> By resetting completely the OS I mean that I wiped my HD and installed Sierra cleanly. I did already reset the SMC and trying now in safe mode, and no restarts yet! What could it mean? <comment350378> If it continues to work in Safe Mode and then the problem returns when booted normally, it's practically 100% certain not to be a hardware issue. However, starting in Safe Mode can also rectify things - so if it's fine in Safe Mode you do need to try booting normally to check whether the issue has been resolved. In a nutshell, if it works okay in Safe Mode and then not normally afterwards, the problem is something you have 'added' to the system (software, hardware, driver, etc). Doing this will narrow down your troubleshooting steps because troubleshooting is a process of elimination. <comment358031> I wonder if we could rephrase this answer?  Nice work writing "an hardware" instead of "a hardware" by the way. <comment358193> Oh my god, I did a spelling mistake, I should commit suicide... <comment358264> I am most sorry!  I was trying to say that it was **good** that you used _an_ rather than _a_.  There was no sarcasm intended.  It's a fairly well known rule among English speakers, although perhaps not so much US English. <comment358265> As for the rephrasing, I didn't spell out what I thought we might change.  Perhaps something very minor:  phrase it as an answer rather than a comment. <comment358657> Ok sorry, I was having a bad day and thought it was sarcasm. <comment358822> Don't mention it, Ambi.  It's too easy to mis-read questions and comments here.
