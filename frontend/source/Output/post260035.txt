Force outgoing SMS instead of iMessage from an iPhone 6S+ to a specific contact who uses iPhone/iMessage? <body> Essentially, I would like to set my phone so that all my outgoing messages to a specific friend, with whom I currently text back and forth over iMessage, are sent out over SMS, never IMessage. Additionally, I would like to block any incoming iMessages texts of his and (hopefully) they'll fail and be resent via SMS.  Let me restate that: I would like to force SMS for both parties, going both ways, for a specific individual contact. Blocking any usage of iMessage between myself and this other individual, so they must either send and receive any texts to or from me via SMS (or the texts fail/never arrive).   Is that possible?  <comment325439> The short answer is no, at least not with the stock Messages app. <comment325447> Related - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155573/disabling-imessage-while-travelling/155614#155614 http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153492/how-to-tell-messages-im-not-at-home & http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/148579/mark-phone-number-as-cannot-receive-imessages In short, it cannot be done. <comment325525> @tubedogg can you elaborate on a replacement app that would allow that?
