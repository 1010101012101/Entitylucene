Keyboard Maestro vs Learning OSX API and a DIY approach? <body> Being a student, I try to avoid software cost as much as I can (otherwise it quickly adds up: IntelliJ, 1Password, etc.) while still trying to be as productive as I can with a long term vision: learn to be a power user, favor keyboard over mouse, learn to automate things, etc. Keyboard Maestro can help in this regard but so does programming...  Keyboard Maestro is a macro app for OSX. It must be paid and learned before used. On the other hand, I could learn OSX API and program my own simpler macro utility based on my needs, this would be free, doesn't make me dependent on 3rd party software and allows me to have potentially more features.  Is it worth it in the long run?  edit: there is also Hammerspoon that helps with OSX API (http://www.hammerspoon.org/)
