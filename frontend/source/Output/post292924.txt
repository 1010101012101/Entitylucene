Stolen iphone se <body> After my phone was stolen i had find my iphone app on and it locked when the person tried turning it on, I recently activated a new phone but didn't wipe clean my old phone. Can the person who stole it gain access? What would they have to do in order to unlock it since i did have the passcode activated as well. Did they just steal a paper weight?   <comment369581> You can probably find your answer [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/199478/121968).
