adding a icon to home screen for a contact to facetime <body> I want to add a icon to iPad/iPhone homescreen such that on clicking on it results in a contact's facetime call initiation.  the closest I could come up with is a facetime url as a bookmark which on click initiates a call something like   precodefacetime://9999999999 /code/pre  however it sits on a browser bookmarks bar.  <answer87814> How much would that feature be worth to you?  FaceDialer, which I stumbled on while attempting to download smcFanControl, claims to be able to create those links, but is a paid app.
