Is is possible to adjust QuickLook windows so they always float in front of other windows? <body> How can I make QuickLook window in Lion (Mountain Lion) stay on top of all other windows regardless of current active app? QL worked that way in 10.6.8 after applying the following string via Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder QLHidePanelOnDeactivate 0 /code/pre  But it doesn't work in Lion or ML.
