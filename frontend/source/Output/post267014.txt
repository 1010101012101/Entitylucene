Reuse App ID with freshly created Developer Team <body> I have two apps on one Developer account which have been tested through TestFlight feature, but never released.  Now, the customer accidentally decided to release them via absolutely new Developer Team. I'm Admin in both of teams, and have email/password access for Team Agent of new account.  As far as I know, you can delete/transfer your apps if you ever released it to the AppStore. But it's not our case. Also, I can't change App's Bundle ID due to existing uploads to it with Bundle ID being linked. Since these apps using their App IDs, I can't remove them in the Member Center. And moreover, I can't use them in new account.  I know we could change App ID, but it's linked to a bunch of various 3rd-parties to which I don't have an access, and this would take sufficient time to retrieve the credentials.  ol liIs there any option for me to solve it having only what I got?/li liOr will it be enough if I catch email/password for Team Agent of current team?/li liIf not, then only way is to first release the app under current account and after transfer it to new one?/li liOr I can't do anything but use different Bundle ID?/li /ol  <answer267024> ol liRelease your app in the App Store with the old account. /li liThe minute it is released (you can specify the date), you change the status to 'Developer Rejected'/li liTransfer your app to the new account./li /ol  &nbsp;  From Apple Developer documentation:     Before you transfer an app to another developer, ensure you’ve met the   following criteria:      ul   liMake sure your accounts aren’t in a pending or changing state./li   liMake sure the app uses only technology and content that can be transferred./li   liNo version of the app can use an iCloud entitlement./li   liNo version of the app can use a Passbook entitlement./li   liThe app can’t offer (or have previously offered) in-app purchase subscriptions: auto-renewable, free, or non-renewing./li   liThe App must have had strongat least one version/strong that has been strongreleased/strong to the App Store./li   /ul      Make sure the app and any in-app purchase products it offers have a   status that supports transfers. The app status can be one of the following:      ul   liReady for Sale/li   liPrepare for Submission/li   liDeveloper Removed From Sale/li   liInvalid Binary/li   liDeveloper Rejected/li   liRejected/li   /ul   <comment334970> What will happen to push notifications then? App is built with Amazon Services, including SNS. If I transfer an app, will they work stable? Should I re-create push notification certificates for next builds? <comment334971> It uses the same certificates right? In that case it shouldn't be a problem.
