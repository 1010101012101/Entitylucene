How to compare 2 Pages documents? <body> I worked for a long time on a Pages document: codefile.1.pages/code.  I didn't activate codeEdit &gt; Track Changes/code.  I saved the modified Pages with a new name: codefile.2.pages/code.  Now I would like to check I didn't forget a key point or made any error and review all the modifications I made.  How may I compare codefile.1.pages/code and codefile.2.pages/code?  This isn't a comparison I can deal with manually (too much text, too many small spelling fixes).  I can't use any Microsoft software. I can use any Unix command line.  <answer274876> Here is how to proceed. The receipe isn't as simple as I thought.  ol liFrom codePages/code export files to plain text:  codeFile &gt; Export &gt; Plain Text.../code  so as to get 2 files: codefile.1.txt/code, codefile.2.txt/code./li liOpen both files with codevi/code and apply the following command:  code:%s,/codekbd⌃/kbd+kbdV/kbdkbd⌃/kbd+kbdM/kbdcode,/codekbd⌃/kbd+kbdV/kbdkbd⌃/kbd+kbdM/kbdcode,g/code  this command contains twice the sequence control+V, control+M which is the way to enter the raw return character. The strange effect of this command is to replace any return character (code0x0d/code) with a standard newline character (code0x0a/code) everywhere (codeg/code = global). Then the 2 files are now splitted in different lines and it becomes useful to compare them with any Unix text tool./li liChange the 2 files encoding:  code:set fileencoding=utf-8/code  so as to encode them as text files (and not binary files as they were exported from codePages/code)./li liSave the two files and quit codevi/code:  code:wq/code/li liRun the standard codediff/code command to compare the 2 text files:  codediff file.1.txt file.2.txt/code/li /ol  <comment344370> If you are only looking at the text (i.e., don't need to compare formatting changes as well), you could export both `.pages` files to plain text (File - Export...) and then compare them with `diff`/Xcode's FileMerge/etc.
