Difficulty setting up email in new iPhone <body> I'm trying to set up a new iPhone and I am not able to receive emails, I've tried to reenter and deleted the email address and password and re-entered several times.  <comment319532> Can you provide more info? What version of iOS are you running? What type of email account is it? Can you connect to the internet using other apps on your iPhone? And have you tried using both Wifi and your cellular network? Can you check email ok using another device?
