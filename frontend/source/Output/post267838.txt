After waking from sleep, USB 3.0 drive fails to mount on 2015 Retina MacBook <body> Anyone seen this?  Apple support is stumped.  I have a fairly modern, external USB 3.0 drive (LaCie, wall-powered) that is connected to my 2015 Retina MacBook Pro.  After ejecting that drive (used for Time Machine), disconnecting the USB 3.0 connector, disconnecting Ethernet-to-display mini-port, putting the MacBook Pro to sleep, when I later wake that same machine and re-plug in the USB 3.0 drive, the drive will not mount.  MacOS 10.11.6.  If I restart the MacBook Pro, the drive WILL mount.  If I unplug the non-mounting drive, and plug it into a nearby iMac, the drive will mount.  If I then eject it from the iMac, and attempt to plug it back into the MacBook Pro, it still will not mount.  The cable is new -- an Amazon Basics USB 3.0 A-Male to Micro-B.  Fairly heavy-duty.  Once the drive DOES mount, no amount of sleep will cause the drive to disconnect by accident.  I've tried SMC reset.
