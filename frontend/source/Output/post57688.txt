Youtube on AppleTV, continuously? <body> Is there a way, with the current AppleTV, to watch a bunch of Youtube videos without having to select each one by hand?  That is, either by entering some keywords to search for, or by providing it with a 'playlist' somehow.  Order isn't important.  Exact matching isn't important.  A method for doing this that involved streaming from a Mac would be fine, too, though I don't have a Mac capable of Airplay Mirroring, so that specific feature won't help me.  <answer59340> I asked at an Apple store, and basically the answer is "no".  The best workaround we could come up with is creating a Youtube account, making a playlist on Youtube, adding all the videos I want to that, and then playing them through AppleTV.  It's not exactly convenient, though.  <answer94638> Yes there is a way.  Just add your videos to your "watch later" playlist.  And just play.  It will play all the videos uninterrupted.  N-joy  <comment329581> used to work this way + the exact same way for Vimeo. Not anymore however. 3th gen Apple TV + 'dumb TV'
