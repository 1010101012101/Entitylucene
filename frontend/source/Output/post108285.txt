Attaching external display to MacBook Pro through VGA → DVI → Thunderbolt <body> I am trying to attach an external monitor to my MacBook Pro using VGA to DVI adapter and then DVI to Thunderbolt.   I have MacBook Pro 2012 with Retina display and the monitor is Acer V223HQV.  Problem is that when I connect it the external monitor doesn't start working but is visible under System Preferences → Displays. Anyone can help me out here? What extra information I can give you to help solve this problem?  <answer108289> It's not possible because the Mini-Displayport ("Thunderbolt") to DVI adapter outputs a DVI-D (digital-only) signal, while DVI to VGA adapters work by taking the analog signal out of DVI-I (digital+analog).  You'll need a Mini-Displayport to VGA adapter.  <comment126940> You mean *Macbook → TB → DVI → VGA → Acer*? <comment126941> Yes, exactly... <comment126943> Isn't it easier to buy a new monitor? ;o) <comment126946> Maybe, but I would prefer using this one. <comment126964> Exactly right sir.
