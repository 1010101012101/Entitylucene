Can a VirtualBox Windows 7 virtual machine be installed on a USB hard disk? <body> My MacBook Air has only a 64G hard drive which is so small that I don't want to install virtual machines on it. I'm planning to buy a 1TB portable USB hard disk to run virtual machines. Has anyone tried running a Windows 7 VirtualBox virtual machine on a USB3.0 hard drive with success?   <answer88079> Yes, it's possible.  First you need to create the virtual machine, after you completed the wizard don't start the VM but go to the menu codeMachine/code - codeShow in Finder/code  Copy the 3 files (codeVM Name/code.vbox, codeVM Name/code.vbox-prev, codeVM Name/code.vdi) to your external hard disk.  After select the VM inside virtualbox and go to menu codeMachine/code - codeRemove.../code and click the button codeDelete all files/code  After go to menu codeMachine/code - codeAdd../code and select the VM file you copied before.  Now the VM is inside virtualbox and runs from your external hard disk.  <comment303177> Did it work? If so which hard disk did you use?
