Remove device from iCloud <body> I sold my iPad (after restoring it and deleting all accounts/data), but it still shows up in iCloud settings under "Devices". Since I don't have access to the iPad anymore, how can I delete it from iCloud.com?  <answer148377> First, contact the new owner, and ask him/her to enable Airplane mode. Once that's done, visit https://www.icloud.com/#find, and select the device. You should now have the ability to click "Remove from Account".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SALjp.png" alt="enter image description here"
