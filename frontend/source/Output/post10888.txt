How can I get some basic GNU utilities on my iPhone? <body> I'm specifically looking for codedu/code, but really, I want the usual suite of command line power tools. Which package contains those?  <answer10890> Using codedpkg -S du/code I discovered that there is a copy of codedu/code in the Cydia libexec folder. It's not quite as nice as finding it in /bin, but it'll serve my purposes nicely. The general question is still open, though; where can I find awk, sed, and so on?  <answer10894> codecoreutils/code provides codedu/code and other CLI tools.  <comment11404> Excellent. Thanks! <comment295133> The full path to the `du` in the Cydia libexec folder: `/usr/libexec/cydia/du`
