Suggestd Crash due to SGSqliteDatabaseError <body> I'm currently working in an environment with some Openldap users and nfs mounted homes. Everything is working like a charm, but I'm facing some issues regarding some ReportCrash that keeps writing in the users code/home/user/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/code thousands of logs codesuggestd_2017-07-12-095040_e5r1p1.crash/code  When I give a look in /var/log/system.log, it's completely saturated with ReportCrash full log here     suggestd[2792]: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception   'SGSqliteDatabaseError', reason: 'Error(5): database is locked (SQL:   PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL)'   I'm wondering how to perhaps, unlocked that SQLite database ? or simply disable suggestd to write down files every 10 seconds.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7264893?start=15&amp;tstart=0  I've tried to unload theses services, with no changes at all. I'm looking to either fix that "crash", or simply disable that suggestd once and for all.  <comment367549> Hi - why the NFS and ldap tags? Is there a back story to your setup or a relation to the crash that we're missing? <comment367550> This only occurs when a user is log into the machine.
