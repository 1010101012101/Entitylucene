Is there a way to browse the OS X App Store from iPad? <body> There are times that I'd like to browse the OS X App Store from my iPad - to get info for future reference.  But when I try, I get a message that I have to use a Mac.  Is there a way around this?  <answer74455> As @jaume has mentioned, you can use the strongMac App Store Preview/strong on Apple's Website to browser apps from the Mac App Store. The same exists for iOS apps and is labeled as strongiTunes Preview/strong.  As you will have already noticed, the search box on Apple's website is not very helpful when searching for Apps. The best alternative I can think of uses a google query. In the Google search box type:  site:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ "Mac App Store" MyKeyword  ...which uses the URL:  precodehttp://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=site:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/%20%22Mac%20App%20Store%22%20 /code/pre  ol liCopy and paste the URL/li liAdd your keyword to the end (separate multiple keywords by code%20/code)/li /ol  <comment86452> Have you tried the Mac App Store Preview: https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id39?mt=12? <comment86580> Thanks to both @jaume and gentmatt.  From iMac, the itunes preview works -- I was going to say visa-versa in my question, so I'm peased to have this link as well.  I'm on the iMac now, but will use the ipad - mac app version pretty soon.  Also, the search advice whould be helpful.
