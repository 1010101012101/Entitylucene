How to format a partition for bootcamp without to partitioning all drive? <body> I'm trying to install a Windows 10 in my MacBook Pro 2012 with El Capitan. I am now in the step that Bootcamp will create a volume for Windows installation. My MacBook got two internal (physical) disk drives:  ul liOne main SATA SSD 240GB with the OS X, and I wish to keep like this./li liOne secondary SATA HDD 500GB (the original HDD) in the optical drive bay using a HDD Caddy./li /ul  The second HDD got a 240GB that Carbon Copy was using to daily backup, now I'm using an external HDD so I'll use this space to Windows. The rest of HDD is an OS X volume for everything that does not fit inside the SSD (extra space).  So diskutil reports this info:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS MacProSSDBoot           239.7 GB   disk0s2 /dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS WindowsBoot             239.5 GB   disk1s2    3:                  Apple_HFS MacProHDPlus            259.6 GB   disk1s4 /dev/disk3 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *8.0 GB     disk3    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 WININSTALL              8.0 GB     disk3s1 /dev/disk4 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            J_CCSA_X64FRE_PT-BR... +4.4 GB     disk4 /dev/disk5 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Boot Camp              +2.8 GB     disk5 /code/pre  The problem is Bootcamp is showing two drives - SDD and HDD - and my options are to divide the SDD (don't want to) or to format all 500GB HDD to make it exclusive for Windows. I don't want to dedicate all that space for Windows! Maybe if I do format the HDD again but I'll have to find some place to save all the - and it takes some time. Also, I am afraid of to do as Bootcamp said (format all 500GB) and not being able to resize the Windows partition to recreate the OS X partition.  Is there "on the fly" solution without removing the OS X partition? Can I do as Bootcamp says and resize to decrease partition size so I can bring my data back?  <comment298039> I assume at this point the Boot Camp Assistance has put files on a USB flash drive? <comment298058> Yes, I did the two first steps already.
