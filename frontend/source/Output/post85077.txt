Time Capsule external hard drive (usb) <body> I've added an external (Freecom XS 1TB) hard disk to my Time Capsule. However, this one's Mac Journaled (HFS+) formatted and does not display in Finder until I add a hub between the TC and external HDD.  The Freecom XS is powered, and when I add a Western Digital HDD without powering it displays in Finder.  What am I missing? Both are formatted Mac Journaled HFS+.  <comment97993> what kinda hub are you talking about? <comment98077> usb, as stated in the title. <comment98148> so you add a USB (powered?) hub and then it works? <comment98271> Yes, that's why I don't get it. The usb-hub both works, with or without power. <comment98470> what do you mean the usb-hub both works? with or without power? is your hub powered or not? <comment98868> Whether I power my USB hub or not, my Freecom XS is available. If I don't use a hub, it displays no disk at all.  If I plug in my WD it displays without hub. <comment99098> that is totally messed up, im sorry then i don't have a straight to solution for that!
