VMWare and Windows Development <body> I am having issues with permissions from windows.  I am have installed a copy of visual studio on my computer and I can't seem to access a few of the plugins.  The errors states the application cannot create folders on the disk.  Is there some type of way to allow access with VMware to allow writing to the disk for a specific application?  <comment135167> It seems very unlikely to me that your answer would lie in the host OS.  Virtualization programs usually allow the guest OS to manage its own disk.  However, if you're using shared folders somehow in this arrangement, this may bear looking intoâ€”are you?  If so, that's probably an important detail you should explain in your question. <comment135174> I currently have it installed so that I can mirror both mac and PC files (shared docs).  But from what you said, this sounds unlike that this would be the issue that I have would be related to file permissions. <comment135189> Where on the disk are you trying to create folders )both the Windows and OSX paths) <comment135192> The desktop of the MAC, which is the same but the path is an alias //VMWare.  This is Visual Studio's issue, but I am unsure why it cannot write.  I was able to run everything else, until I had to build the project which needs to generate the DLLs.
