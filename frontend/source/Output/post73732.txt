Macbook Pro with 10.7.5 hanging when closing screen <body> I have some problems on my Macbook.  Whenever I close the screen and I open it up again, the problem starts.  Sometimes I am able to login, but once I am inside, the computer freezers. Other times I am not even able to log in, because the login screen is frozen already.  I would like to know what are the possible causes of this and how could I potentially solve it.  I know the question might be a little bit vague, but that is basically what is happening.  EDIT:  precodeHere is what I see in system.log at the time that I try to start again:  Dec  4 09:40:08 localhost bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1354610408 0 Dec  4 09:40:09 localhost com.apple.launchd[1]: *** launchd[1] has started up. *** Dec  4 09:40:10 localhost com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.powerd): Unknown value for key POSIXSpawnType: Interactive Dec  4 09:40:10 localhost com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sandboxd): Unknown value for key POSIXSpawnType: Interactive Dec  4 09:40:10 localhost fseventsd[24]: event logs in /.fseventsd out of sync with volume.  destroying old logs.

Which ones should I check? <comment85686> system.log is always a good start <comment85751> Edited my question with info in system.log <comment232967> So, had you solve it?
