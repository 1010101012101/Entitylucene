How to sync an online PDF on the iPad <body> Is there a way to autosync a PDF file from a URL to my iPad?  Specifically, there is a PDF file in the public domain at a known URL. But the author modifies it every few days, and I want somehow that the file be mirrored locally on my iPad.  <comment282142> I don't know of any applications that can do such a thing besides regular file-syncing applications like Dropbox. So maybe you can contact the author and have him set up an RSS feed or share a public Dropbox or something. The idea behind a PDF is that it's a final document like a printed piece of paper. This just sounds like a bad user experience all-around. <comment286083> I found an application called Papers3, which lets me create a link and fetches the pdf every time I click on it. It is a bit tedious to set up this feature, and the extra effort put in just makes me go to the website instead and pull the PDF file every time :)
