Apple Watch Remote Old iPhone <body> My setup is as follows:  I have the Apple Watch on my wrist, and I have an old iPhone 4s with iOS 8.4 sitting on a docking station  Can I control the music playing through the iPhone through the Watch? - I can control the music playing on my mac &amp; newer iPhone 6 but can't figure out, if possible, how to do it on the old one?  <answer194016> You can't control music on the iPhone 4s because Apple made it so the iPhone 4s doesn't support the Apple Watch.  <comment231281> the newest one available 8.4
