National Instruments viFindRsrc hangs for multiple session use <body> I am using National Instruments NI-Visa for finding the GPIB resources. The issue i am facing is viFindRsrc() hangs for multiple session. I have 2 applications which uses viFindRsrc(). I am using viClose() to release the allocated resources. viFindRsrc() hangs in the second application even after releasing the resource using viClose(). If i terminate the first application and use second application viFindRsrc() works fine. I found the same problem with National Instruments utilities. Any help in resolving this issue will be appreciated.
