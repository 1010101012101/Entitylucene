"Go" button on the Finder window <body> I am trying to remove the plug-in for Unsubscribe to avoid the message appearing every time I open my Mac.  To do so, I am supposed to click on the "Go" button in the Finder window.  Unfortunately, I can't see where is the "Go" button on the Finder window on an iMac OS X Version 10.7.5.  <answer99424> It is likely directing you to the Go menu in Finder. It looks like this.
