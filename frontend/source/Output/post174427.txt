Calendar App with CSV import <body> At the moment i'm trying to switch from Outlook to Apple Mail / Cal.app and would like to know if anyone here has found a way to batch import Calendar events consistently from CSV files.  The usual CSV - Google - iCal route is not what i'm looking for.  Maybe an alternative (calendar) app for the Mac?  <answer174477> If you want an app/program I would recommend that you search the Mac App Store and try googling for one. I've heard that Sunrise Calendar is good but I think you need to find one that works good for you.  Personally, I would pin the Google Calendar website in Safari "Top Sites".  <comment205510> Already did that. Can't import CSV into google cal either. <comment205622> @m_br Which calendars are you wanting to use? What company/brand do they come from? <comment206091> I am using google calendar to sync my events, iCal as the desktop software. what i want is a simple way to batch import events from the desktop
