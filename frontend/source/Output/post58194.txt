Syncing Notes with Gmail & iCloud <body> In the codeMail, Contacts &amp; Calendars/code Preference pane, you can have codeNotes/code synchronize with a Gmail account.

To sync a note with Gmail do the following  ol liSet up your account and check the notes box in the Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars preference pane./li liGo to notes in Mountain Lion/li liGo to View - Show Folders List -- or -- click the folders list icon in the bottom left side of the Notes window/li liFrom here you should be able to select your Gmail account instead of iCloud and create a new note/li liWithin Gmail you should have a folder called "Notes" and your newly created note should be inside/li /ol
