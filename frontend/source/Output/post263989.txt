Making an AppleScript that holds down a key <body> So I'm trying to make a script that holds down a key like Left option. But I don't want to use something like  precodetell application "x"     keystroke *keycode* end tell /code/pre  I tried doing that, but the app I'm trying to make it work for won't accept it.  So I thought of trying to make a script that just holds down a key (specifically a modifier key) for an indefinite time.  Is there any solution?  <answer263992> codekeystroke/code is actually part of the application "System Events, so try something like this:  precodetell application "x" to activate delay 1 tell application "System Events"     tell process "x"         repeat n times             keystroke "keycode"         end repeat     end tell end tell /code/pre  Where x is the application/process and n is a number.  <answer266895> Try running your code using the codekey down/code &amp; codekey up/code features of AppleScript.  h1code:/h1  precodetell application "System Events"     key down option     delay 5     key up option end tell /code/pre  <comment330800> Do you need [longer than 2 seconds](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/248861/how-to-make-applescript-hold-a-key-for-2-seconds)? <comment330804> Please, don't guess! Your script simply repeats keycode n times, but doesn't hold down a key!
