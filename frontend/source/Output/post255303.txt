Not able to select internal micro/speaker when external one is connected <body> Whenever I plug in my headset adapter (this one), I am unable to select the internal speaker/microphone in Settings or in the menubar. It's really annoying, cause I don't want to plug it out every time I don't use my headset.  Any solution for this?  <comment317967> What is an intern speaker/micro? <comment317988> @IronCraftMan internal* sry
