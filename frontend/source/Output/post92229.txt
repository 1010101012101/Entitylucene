Keyboard layout not usable in all programs <body> I have used Ukelele to create a keyboard layout file (codefoo.keylayout/code) that lives in code~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/code. I used a US english layout as a base and have added some keymappings that let me type æøå (Norwegian characters) by pressing the left codealt/option/code key and the code'/code, code;/code and code[/code keys, plus some other symbols I use often – all using the left codealt/option/code key.  This works great in most programs, like this text area in Chrome, in Finder, Macvim, Terminal… almost everywhere.  emBut/em, in Evernote and Sparrow, these mappings do not work, and if I show the current layout in the menu, I see that it switches back to the US layout when I bring one of these programs to the front. It is not possible to switch to my own layout in the dropdown menu – it switches back to US again immediately.  Is it possible to fix this – or is this because of the technologies used by Evernote and Sparrow?  <answer92253> Things you could try:  ul liMove the keyboard layout to code/Library/Keyboard Layouts//code. Keyboard layouts in the user library can't be selected in password dialogs or the login window./li liChange the ID from Keyboard  Set Keyboard ID... in Ukelele./li liSave the keyboard layout as a bundle instead of an XML file./li /ul  To apply changes to a keylayout file, you can for example run codesudo touch /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts//code and log out and back in.  <comment108228> Try putting the .keylayout file in Library/Keyboard Layouts and restart.  Have you asked the folks who make those apps? <comment108260> Thank you so much! I changed the ID and moved the `.keylayout` file to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` and it works perfectly now.
