Macbook hangs when when unplugging external Monitor <body> I have a Retina Macbook and macOS Sierra but the symptoms are the same as described in this post almost 10 years ago: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/822656?tstart=0  I am using external display and keep MacBook closed. However when I unplug the display and later open the lid it either thinks that it is still connected or just hangs up.   One would think there were some advancements in 10 years, but apparently nothing changed. Is there anything I can do?  I use Macbook Retina Mid 2013 with different displays and adapters, normally I have 1 or 2 different displays plugged in using two Display Ports depending on whwere I am working at the moment.  strongUPDATE/strong Now I have a Macbook Pro 15" 2016 with Touchbar and dedicated video card and it's even worse. So I guess it's just a fact of life let's see if High Sierra changes anything.  <answer259456> I would restart the computer. I have a macbook pro 2009 and the same issue pertains to me.  <answer259489> It appears a SMC reset will fix your issue. I just answered another question pertaining to display issues.
