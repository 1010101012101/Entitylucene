Toggle Finder sort order with AppleScript under Lion 10.7? <body> For years I've been using this AppleScript to toggle the sort order of a Finder window:  precodeif sort direction of column id size column of list view options of window 1 is normal then     set sort direction of column id size column of list view options of window 1 to reversed else     set sort direction of column id size column of list view options of window 1 to normal end if /code/pre  (You can replace codesize/code with codekind/code, codename/code, codemodification date/code, etc.)  But ever since Lion, this no longer works!  The little arrow in the column header DOES change, but the items do not re-sort.  Any way to get this working?  <answer60313> This is a bit hacky, but changing the sort column before and after changing the sort direction seemed to work on Mountain Lion.  precodetell application "Finder"     tell list view options of window 1         set sort column to name column         tell column size column             if sort direction is normal then                 set sort direction to reversed             else                 set sort direction to normal             end if         end tell         set sort column to size column     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment69475> ha! that works, thanks! silly. <comment69476> And I didn't know you could nest the `tell list view options` ... excellent! <comment69477> ... and turns out you can nest the `tell column size column` as well: `tell column size column ... if sort direction is normal then ... end tell`
