MacBook Pro 2016 USB-C to HDMI (Apple Multiport Adapter) problem <body> My MacBook won't display anything connected through an strongUSB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter/strong to HDMI display. I have tried with many (Dell, Samsung, Acer, Iyama, LG, from the local store) external displays.  Sometimes (after a restart, with SMC reset) it works for 5 seconds and suddenly stops. It does not even show the external display in the preferences.  Do you know how to fix it?

It seems the one I was using was broken. Now everything is fine and the display displays :).  <comment347284> Welcome to Ask Different. So we can help you we're really going to need more detail than what you've provided. Can you add the following details to your question: (1) Besides restarting the MBP, what else have you already tried? (2) What is the exact model of your external display? (3) Can you confirm this is the [adapter](Apple Multiport Adapter HDMI) you're using? If not, can you clarify. (4) Does your MBP recognise the external display? <comment347297> Did you make sure everything is fully plugged in? Try playing with each of the connections. Also curious what your display settings say. <comment347328> @Monomeeth I have completed the information. <comment347330> @JBallin I have played with all the connections with many displays. How should I check my display settings? <comment347390> Maybe go to Apple Store so somebody can look at it in person. Also maybe try another adapter/hdmi cable. <comment347402> @JBallin I will do it tomorrow :(.
