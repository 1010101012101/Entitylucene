No bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key after Boot Camp <body> When I tried to install Windows on my iMac I must have have formatted the wrong disk. Now when start I get no bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key. Any suggestions!  <comment98696> Have you tried installing Windows again with the DVD ? (Boot on the DVD w/ option key at the chime) <comment99095> Just to clarify, your Mac doesn't boot at all, not even OS X?
