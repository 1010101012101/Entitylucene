Understanding firmware.scap <body> So, I recently acquired an old MacbookPro (v.5,4 mid 2009). I decided to create an Arch linux partition, and thus began my adventure... While installing rEFInd (the maintained fork of rEFIt), I ended up doing the following:  ol liMounted the EFI partition in /Volumes/li liMoved the necessary binaries into /Volumes/.../refind//li liMessed up/li liDecided to quickly start over by removing refind/li liHastily decided to rm -rf *, but did not realize I was not in /refind/li liEnded up deleting everything in /Volumes/EFI/*/li li...which included APPLE/EXTENSIONS/firmware.scap/li liFreaked out/li liFreaked out some more because I wasn't exactly sure what I just did.../li liShutdown and rebooted, praying I wouldn't hit a brick wall/li li...and then.../li li...Everything worked find./li /ol  But I still do not have a EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/firmware.scap, so my questions are:  What is the firmware.scap? Why isn't my computer freaking out?  I've skimmed some literature on the internet, but there doesn't seem to be that much definitive information, just people giving rote directions to flash EFI firmware for those of us who have deleted it. If someone could just point me in the right direction (to learn more precisely about firmware.scap), I would be very grateful.  <answer163886> This file is always at this location: code/usr/standalone/i386/Firmware.scap/code  <comment165976> maybe this helps you http://blog.remysaissy.com/2012/02/restoring-apples-efi-on-macbookpro-with.html?m=1 <comment292937> Good questions. I am also confused by it. But I think deleting anything from the disk will not affect the firmware because the actual firmware is not installed on your hard drive, otherwise it will not be called firmware.
