iPhone how to disable sound notifications at work <body> Let's say you are at the office 9-5, can you schedule the phone to be muted (mostly messaging, FB) during these hours and / or this location.  <answer288361> This can be done by scheduling strongDo Not Disturb/strong.  Go into strongSettings/strong → strongDo Not Disturb/strong and emenable/em codeScheduled/code emfrom/em 9 a.m. emTo/em 5 p.m.  Under strongAllow Calls From/strong you may allow certain people to call you even while strongDo Not Disturb/strong is active. Calls silenced by strongDo Not Disturb/strong will go directly to voicemail.  At your discretion, you may also choose to codeAlways/code silence notifications, or codeOnly while iPhone is locked/code.  Emergency and Amber Alerts will still blare through strongDo Not Disturb/strong. Those may only be silenced by toggling the hardware strongMute/strong switch, or by disabling them at the bottom of the strongNotifications/strong menu.  <comment364795> Thanks for the answer @Phong. Is there a way to set multiple schedules (like 9@5, 12@6am, etc.) ? <comment364796> Unfortunately, not as of iOS 11. It is also not possible to geofence DND. <comment364867> When is the iPhone is considered in locked state? <comment364971> I’m sorry; I don’t understand what you mean by that. <comment365099> when you say "Only while iPhone is locked", do you mean the lock screen? <comment365103> Yes, the iPhone is locked when it’s on the lock screen or the screen is off. <comment365260> i'm still looking for a solution that can support multiple schedules, but your reply answers the question the way it is phrased, so I'll accept your answer.
