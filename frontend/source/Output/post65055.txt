Typing over selected text replaces some text to the right <body> In OS X (both Lion and Mountain Lion), I notice that when I select text and type over it, not only does it yield the expected result of replacing that text with the typed text, it often also replaces a few characters to the right. When that happens, I notice that after the first few keystrokes, some text remains selected.  <comment76468> So what is the question? This happens because the autocorrection system lags behind your typing speed, mainly due to a slow computer. <comment76496> It's a correctness issue, not a performance issue. If it was a lag issue, that can't explain character I type appearing on the screen while the remaining highlighted character stay highlighted and additional characters to the right also become highlighted as a result of typing. <comment76509> That’s exactly what happened on my old Mac. It was solved by a reinstall, and a clean reinstall at that. And trust me, it’s a performance issue. I have found it mainly occurs while using Safari, though I don’t know if that’s because Safari is what I use the most. <comment76606> It's not a performance issue if the actual result of doing something is **incorrect** as opposed to just being slow. As a programmer, I'm aware of the possibility of slowness revealing an otherwise latent bug caused by a race condition. In such cases, performance isn't the prbblem; It merely reveals the problem. A reinstall won't help as I've had this problem on my mid-2011 MacBook Air since I bought it brand new. <comment180996> I've had this issue on my mba since I bought it about a month ago. Autocorrect is disabled. <comment352885> In which applications? And could there be any relation to text encoding (unicode chars)?
