Should I use a package manager? <body> strongI want to keep keep track of which files belong to which application/strong, so that when I uninstall an application, I can be sure all of its files are gone, emincluding configuration files, dependencies it might have installed, etc./em  ol liThere are GUI applications that can be downloaded and just strongdragged and dropped/strong into the Applications folder, like emGIMP/em or emTextMate/em. Is this the best way to install those apps, or should I use a package manager for them? Can I be sure that these applications do not install anything outside of their Application folder? Is deleting an app from the Application folder a "clean" uninstall?/li liThere are applications such as emPython/em which come with an stronginstaller/strong (em.mpkg/em). Is using that installer the best way to install these apps, or should I use a package manager for them? How do I find out which files these installers touched, and how would I undo everything that installer does in a clean way?/li /ol  I'm interested in some kind of strongbest practices/strong, for which using a package manager is recommended, and when just installing it like said above is "clean" enough.  <answer135637> Since I do not install and uninstall multitude of apps daily, I prefer to use something that will not constantly burden my system like a package manager may do.  I use a very simple but very effective app called AppCleaner (what a name), that is only running when I ask for it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8urAf.png" alt="AppCleaner"  It will find all the related files to a given app and show them to me before I hit delete.   It allows the deselection of drivers ect. if you want to keep them for some reason.  <comment160778> If you do not mind having a additional burden to your CPU/kernel in keeping track of those then yes. there are simple programs (that I use) to do the same and they only look for the family when you want to uninstall <comment160779> Can you name one of these "simple programs"? And what would be the advantage of using that instead of a full fledged package manager?
