Set Messages app to show Names and Pictures by default for all conversations <body> I know I can set show names and pictures for conversations. How do I set this as default for all conversations? I set this and then exit messages and re-open it and it is back to only showing the pictures. I tried to delete the plist files from ~/Library/Preferences for iChat.   <answer131498> This looks like a bug. Mine when checked does the same.  So I set it again and I also changed the strongShow As Balloons/strong to strongShow As boxes/strong. Quit and re opened. This stuck.  I then Change back to strongShow As Balloons/strong  Quit and re opened. Both settings stuck.  Tested on two Macs. Same thing  hr  Further investigation which I think proves it is a bug  The strongshow names and pictures/strong or what ever you set in the app is actually being written out to the plist file.  The Dictionary strongSOTranscriptSettingsDefaultIMChatSettingsPreferences/strong   that holds this preference strongparticipantDisplay/strong changes from number value 0 to 1 or 2.  The problem is the original default in the Dictionary strongSOTranscriptSettingsDefaultIMChatSettingsPreferences/strong is to only have the strongparticipantDisplay/strong entry.  When you also change the  strongShow As Balloons/strong setting to something else like boxes a new entry  strongtranscriptStyleID/strong is added to the Dictionary strongSOTranscriptSettingsDefaultIMChatSettingsPreferences/strong. Which will have the string value of for example emcom.apple.iChat.Styles.Balloons/em.  Once both entries exist then the setting strongparticipantDisplay/strong is actually actioned.  I used Defaults delete,write to remove and replace these settings and the results are consistent.  <comment154510> Updated my answer <comment154515> I have filed a bug report with Apple. <comment157860> This worked perfect for me. Thanks. <comment157871> Apple have advised me this is fixed in 10.10. Although I cannot specify here yet (pre public release). It has "in a way been" fixed in 10.10 <comment312536> still a big problem today <comment312538> can you provide detail instructions?
