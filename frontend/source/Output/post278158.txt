Delay when typing in OSX <body> Ever since updating to Mavericks (On Sierra now) I have gotten a delay when entering anything into the keyboard. This is most apparent in chrome, but happens elsewhere. The beachball loading pops up for maybe 5 seconds max.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I am running a Late 2011 Macbook Pro.  <comment350047> I remember having this problem on a 2006 iMac. I think it's mainly due to age etc. My suggestion would be: 1) make a time machine backup, 2) copy all of your files to an external hard drive, 3) wipe your drive and do a clean install, 4) restore your files from the external drive (or time machine backup, but I'm not sure that this won't bring back the clutter that was slowing the computer in the first place)
