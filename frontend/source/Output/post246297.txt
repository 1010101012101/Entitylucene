Are updates available for Maps on the iPhone 6s plus <body> Maps for my area has not been updated and is missing some major highway additions.  I'm currently using Google as a substitute but its not as integrated into iOS.  <answer246301> Apple does do updates but they're primarily server-side, so you might not notice the updates each time.  The best way to send Apple feedback about incorrect Maps data is to use emReport a Problem/em under the â“˜ button.  There you can indicate what error the map has and send it to Apple.  Unfortunately, Apple has not published or otherwise indicated a timeframe as to when they will push-out corrections.
