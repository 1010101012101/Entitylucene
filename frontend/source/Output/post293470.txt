Lost note on Iphone 4s (ios 7.1.2) when battery ran out of power <body> I was writing a long (and to me important) note on my Iphone in "Notes", when it ran out of power. When I connected it to power and opened it up again, the note was missing. I have tried to find it in my mail-system, but it isn't there either (even though all my other notes are there). What confuses me is, that you never save notes manually in this app - it seems to happen automatically. I don't have connection to Icloud, it should be said, due to a lack of space. Could it be somewhere on the phone still, and what are the ways to recover it?
