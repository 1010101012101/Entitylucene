How to retrieve backed-up game data from iCloud after reinstalling a game? <body> I deleted a game from my iPad and was wondering if i could retrieve the data somehow, because the game was backed up on iCloud and when i reinstalled it all my data was gone. How do i retrieve the data specifically for this app from iCloud.  <answer54610> According to the Apple Support topic on the subject, your only option is to restore your entire phone from a recent backup.    The article does not emexplicitly/em report that there is not a way to selectively restore data, but it emdoes/em explicitly state the way in which data is restored to a phone--all at once from a backup.    <comment62572> Where to you backup your iPad to, your computer (via iTunes) or iCloud? <comment160027> This is stupid, terrible, and correct :(
