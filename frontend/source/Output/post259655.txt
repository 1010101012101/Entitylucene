iphone messaging: how do I show the senders number <body> When I get a message in from someone, and their contact card has multiple numbers associated with them, how do I then show the actual NUMBER that the message was sent from? (Currently it tells me the emcontact/em name, but not the number emwithin/em that contact)  <answer259656> Click on the circular image on the top in iMessage. It takes you to the contact details. The contact detail in blue is the one which the sender has used to send you the message.
