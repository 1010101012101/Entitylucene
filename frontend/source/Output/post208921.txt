Is there a way to completely disable Spaces in El Capitan? <body> Is there a way to completely disable Spaces in El Capitan without turning off Mission Control, Dashboard, etc.? If not, is there a way to disable drag to space?  I'm using Cinch and I find it quite annoying to be offered space switching when dragging the window to the top of the screen just to maximize it.   <answer210462> I've found that if head to mission control and uncheck 'displays have different spaces', then logout/login you should be sweet. Worked for me anyways.
