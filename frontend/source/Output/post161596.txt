Can't download from App Store <body> A click on "Install App" does nothing. No error message, no download.  I am trying to download an app appropriate for my installed OS.   I've rebooted and signed out/in at the app store. No change.   I'm editing because this appears to be the same issue. I signed out and into the app store, and am trying to update existing software.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hN6x7.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is the resulting error message. It references "other account" but this is the account I use, exact same ID I just signed in with.   <answer161640> Maybe deleting Mac App Store cache can help you. Open Terminal and type:  codeopen $TMPDIR../C//code  This should open Finder. Delete the com.apple.appstore folder and relaunch Mac App Store see if it works.  <answer161645> Try resetting the Mac App Store.  ol liEnable the debug menu and restart the Mac App Store.  precodedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre/li liChoose the strongReset Application/strong option and restart the Mac App Store.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJDwP.png" height="292" alt="App Store Debug Menu"/li /ol  <answer186798> Sometimes, you just need to sign out and sign in again to the Appstore. Worked for me.  <answer191523> After struggling with the error message of "updates for other accounts", I found a solution to all of it.   The apple forums offered the solution through the debug option.   Type codedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true/code into terminal and a combination of Cache Buster, Clear Cookies and Reset App did the trick.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LbaUk.png" alt="enter image description here"  After that, the apps were able to update. FWIW, I tried download a new app, but wasn't quickly able to find a Snow Leo app. 10 tries, and all wanted a newer OS.   <comment188837> Out of curiosity, what app were you attempting to download?  I ran into this yesterday when trying to download Yosemite from a Mac running 10.6.8. <comment188840> https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numi/id484388250?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4 - numi a free (today) calculator app. But then I tried other downloads, none would work. Nor would an update to an app I already own. <comment188892> Thanks. I went through the steps above, and no change. Now trying to figure out if I can reload just the Store or I need to reinstall full OS to fix this.
