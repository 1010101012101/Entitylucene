Cannot hear music being played on my iPhone 4 <body> I cannot hear music being played on iTunes on my iPhone 4. The device indicates that the music is playing, but there is no sound coming out of the phone. All other sounds work.  <comment167019> Welcome to Ask Different! Please limit questions to only one question. <comment167020> Your phone can use other devices for audio output as well. Open 'Music' on your iOS device, play your music. Now swipe from the lower bottom of the screen upwards, a settings menu appears. In this screen you can choose your audio output device (only if multiple devices are available). Is it set to 'iPhone'?
