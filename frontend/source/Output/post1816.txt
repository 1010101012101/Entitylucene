Is there an iPhone app for outlining that has a decent web/desktop companion? <body> I am looking for an emoutliner app for iPhone/em, with either a desktop or web counterpart.  <answer1817> Evernote should work for you, there are web/desktop (PC/Mac) and iPad apps, as well as the iPhone app.  <answer12370> There is an app call Outliner for iPad and iPhone, which has an web companion.  It works for now, but I am waiting for OminiOutliner to come out in 2011 (for iPad, not for iPhone), which should be a much better solution.   <comment1575> You can ask your meta question on http://meta.gadgets.stackexchange.com, but personally I would leave the tags as they are and elaborate on the question. What do you mean by outliner app? What features are you looking for? etc. <comment1576> I mean something that has all the normal outliner features, with demotion and promotion of headings and subheadings, etc. The only other requirement I can think of is that it has a web/desktop client that syncs with the iPhone app. Cheers :) <comment1577> From what I have read, Evernote is not suited at all to outlining. Quoting from a user: 'Outline better. For the love of dog, why can't I tab, shift-tab for indenting just like nearly every other outlining program out there?' <comment5027> Yeah Evernote isn't quite what I had in mind either.  Something a little more along the lines of Freemind/FreePlane or the old Bonzi for Palm OS.
