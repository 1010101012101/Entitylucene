Difference between variable and pipe to shell in applescript <body> In answering this question I wrote this script:  precodeglobal presenterNotes  tell application "Keynote"     activate     open (choose file)     tell front document         set presenterNotes to presenter notes of every slide as text             set the clipboard to presenterNotes         do shell script "pbpaste &gt; ~/keynote-notes.txt"     end tell         quit application "Keynote" end tell /code/pre  strongMy question is:/strong in the instance above when I replace the "shell script" statement with the statement below why does this statement work:  precodetell application "TextEdit"         activate         make new document         set text of front document to presenterNotes         quit application "TextEdit"     end tell /code/pre  strongExample 1:/strong but this one does not:  precodetell application "TextEdit"         activate         make new document with data presenterNotes as text /code/pre  strongExample 2:/strong nor does:          precodemake new document with presenterNotes /code/pre  I know there are other ways to make it work like copy to clipboard and then issue a command+c.   I would like to understand why the global variable is not being transferred to the textEdit document, in particular in Example 1 above, as applescript does not throw an error.  <answer142777> There is a hidden error that is generated when you run your "working" script... You have to bump the codeshell script/code part of the code into its own codetell current application/code block as shown in the second example below...  This version works for me with creating a TextEdit document:  precodeglobal presenterNotes tell application "Keynote"     activate     -- open (choose file)     tell front document         set presenterNotes to presenter notes of every slide as text         set the clipboard to presenterNotes     end tell     tell application "TextEdit"         activate         make new document with properties {name:"KeynoteNotes.txt"}         set text of front document to presenterNotes     end tell end tell /code/pre  The shell codepbpaste/code version with proper blocking to avoid error -10004:  precodeglobal presenterNotes tell application "Keynote"     activate     -- open (choose file)     tell front document         set presenterNotes to presenter notes of every slide as text         set the clipboard to presenterNotes     end tell     tell current application         do shell script "pbpaste &gt; ~/keynote-notes1.txt"     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment168215> Thanks for answering but I still don't know why Example 1 and 2 don't work with the global variable, if you can answer that I will definitely mark your answer correct. <comment168230> Can you post the full script for your examples and not just the couple line excerpts? Mine is only slightly different by the way the `tell` and `end tell` are placed.
