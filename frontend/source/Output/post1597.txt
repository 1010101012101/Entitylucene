Way to back-up phone numbers on iPhone? <body> What is a good service to back up my contacts on my iPhone?  <answer1609> By syncing your contacts with your computer (you also get a backup of the data on your phone each time you sync sans music, photos and the actual applications themselves - just the data). iTunes will talk to Address Book on Mac OS X and Outlook on Windows for desktop applications, otherwise you can use MobileMe, Yahoo or even Gmail as well to sync your contacts.  You can also export your contacts as vCards from your phone or address book of choice and save those somewhere.  <answer1619> I use Google services and probably you as well, I love the translate, the email, documents, reader (RSS), etc ...
