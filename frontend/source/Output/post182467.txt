iMovie in iPad cannot find clips after sync with laptop <body> The kids have loved making movies in iMovie on the iPad. So much so that they filled it with their clips. So I synced to my laptop and selected the "delete from device" option in Photos figuring that iMovie had its own copy and it would free up space.   I was wrong. iMovie says "some videos in your project cannot be found because they were moved or deleted" and offers to search for them.  So I selected them on the laptop synced them back to the iPad again (unchanged, within a few minutes). iMovie cannot find them.  How do I repair this before the kids find out?  signed Trembling Dad.  <comment217246> are they still on your Mac ? <comment217251> yes they are. still in Photos. <comment217253> than you are safe, just play dumb and ask who synced them to your Mac :)
