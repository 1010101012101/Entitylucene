Change mouse pointer in iTerm2 (or disable mouse pointer) <body> In iTerm2 (fullscreen mode) my pointer is permanently a "text select" pointer. It bothers me, so I would either like to change it (to the regular arrow-type pointer) or disable it when in my fullscreen iTerm2 instance. Is this possible? I'm on OSX 10.7.  <answer82284> The behavior is inconsistent between window mode and full screen mode, but this is not something that is configurable. You would probably have to submit a feature request to get this changed.  <answer254862> It's quite old, but...  Open finder (or mc or anything else) then go to /Applications/Iterm.app (press right mouse and choose "Show package content" if in Finder) Content/Resource/  IBarCursor.tiff and IBarCursorXMR.tiff are the cursor images. You can replace or delete them.  <comment94975> Yeah, I figured this wouldn't be possible using iTerm configs. Alternatively, is there a way I can just disable the pointer when in iTerm? <comment317368> Note that depending on the user's version of OS X/macOS and the way the application is designed and published, modifying the contents of the .app package may render it unable to run as it will no longer be a signed bundle. <comment317369> Not the case. Replace safely. <comment350289> If I'm not mistaken, the authentication for apps is something stored in PRAM or NVRAM and only checked the first time it's opened. I only say that because resetting those seems to trigger all of those warnings again.
