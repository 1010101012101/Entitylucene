Cannot configure OpenDNS on iPad <body> The instructions on Internet Safety Project seem simple enough, but, according to all the OpenDNS tests, websites are not working.  I am using a Wi-Fi iPad2 with iOS 7.  <answer111429> That site has the wrong IP addresses for the OpenDNS servers listed. Instead of 208.67.222.123 and 208.67.220.123 enter the correct addresses:  208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220  Source: opendns.com  <comment131080> have you tried with both wifi and cellular?
