My I pad mini won't change to my new Icloud email <body> The Ipad mini was originally registered with a business email address with Apple. when I retired and change my email to personal, I've change it with Apple but the Ipad keeps on asking Apple ID Password and as the account is closed I cannot bypass it.  I tried everything I can find on line, nothing works and I cannot turn off Find My Ipad which everybody recommends as it brings the old Apple ID for authorization.   I'm at a lost here, any suggestions?  <comment325962> Welcome to Ask Different.
