Show/emphasize only certain types of files in finder <body> I use TeX a lot and it generates lots of auxiliary files that I am generally not interested in opening, and they clutter up my folders.  Is there any way to make Finder automatically hide/gray-out files with certain extensions in Compact List or Column views, either for a specific folder or for all folders?    Alternatively, if this is not possible, can I customize the "view by file type" option to separate into my own categories based on file extension (e.g., category 1 would contain .tex and .pdf files, category 2 would contain .sty and .bib, and so on) and have them listed alphabetized by category?
