Can the Finder resume a file copy? <body> I know about rsync and how to use it, but sometimes I just want to copy files using the Finder. However, if that fails, I have to do everything all over again, since the Finder does not seem to be able to resume a file copy action. Is there a way around this?  <answer92052> No, the Finder does what it does and that is do its best not to leave anything unfinished.  If it can't finish a copy it deletes the partials.    You could probably hack together a scriptlet that would let you drag and drop files onto it that would then rsync the file somewhere. You could even make it a folder action.  But it would be limited in where the files end up.    <comment108045> Well, sometimes the partials are not deleted, because the network connection got severed (happens to some of my SMB mounts). In that case, I would have hoped for a resume. Other filemanagers and tools use the .part extension to indicate partial files that could be resumed.
