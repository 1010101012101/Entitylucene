What tools are there for measuring Macbook wireless strength? <body> I often have trouble connecting to wifi with my MacBook Pro. To help identify the problem, I was wondering if there were any tools for measuring wireless signal strength.  <answer3959> If you're just looking for a quick signal strength number, kbdoption/kbd-click on the AirPort icon in the menu bar. Under the connected network you will see several pieces of information:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kxsPx.png" alt="alt text"  RSSI is your signal strengh in dB. Higher (closer to 0) is better.  If you're looking for noise or the signal strength for multiple access points, I suggest checking out iStumbler:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/laVn4.png" alt=""  <answer3971> You can get quite a bit of info from the command line, with the (well-hidden) airport utility.  With the code-I/code flag it'll tell you about the current network:  precode$ /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I      agrCtlRSSI: -43      agrExtRSSI: 0     agrCtlNoise: -96     agrExtNoise: 0           state: running         op mode: station       lastTxRate: 130         maxRate: 130 lastAssocStatus: 0     802.11 auth: open       link auth: wpa2-psk           BSSID: 0:24:1:0a:42:93            SSID: My Wireless             MCS: 15         channel: 5 /code/pre  ...and code-s/code will show more info about other visible networks:  precode$ /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s                             SSID BSSID             RSSI CHANNEL HT CC SECURITY (auth/unicast/group)                      My Wireless 00:24:01:fa:42:93 -44  5       Y  -- WPA(PSK/TKIP,AES/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/TKIP,AES/TKIP)                            hobbit 00:15:05:19:8a:03 -86  7       N  -- WEP                       My Wireless 00:24:01:ef:91:ab -75  3       Y  -- WPA(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP) /code/pre  It doesn't have a man page, but if you run it without any options it'll list its options.  <answer3975> strongSystem Profiler/strong will list available Wireless Networks as well as the following information  precodeNetworkName:   PHY Mode: 802.11n   BSSID:    c0:3f:e:df:1b:be   Channel:  6   Network Type: Infrastructure   Security: WEP /code/pre  <answer62639> If you find that your connection problems occur in the same location, you could use a tool like NetSpot that would let you visually see areas of low signal. NetSpot is free and available within the App Store.  See below for an example of how a map of your apartment's wifi signal could look.  Screenshot showing map of signal strength http://www.netspotapp.com/images/screens/howto1/netspot-snr-selected-ssid.jpg  Macworld reviewed Netspot and published a brief tutorial last year about how it could be used.  <answer84507> Another, out-of-the-box way (at least on Mountain Lion):  ol liClick on the Apple (top left)/li liAbout this Mac/li liMore Info/li liSystem Report/li liWiFi/li /ol  This will show you all the info you want for all the networks in range, without needing to install additional software.  <answer84618> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ltqb2.png" alt="What a Jungle in Spain on the Costa de Soll" Is this useful ? I am actually in a relatively small village, not in New York, or LA :)  <answer84627> I typically use WiFi Explorer. Its newer than iStumbler and provides the following features:  ul liEasy-to-use, intuitive user interface./li liGraphical visualization of the wifi environment./li liWorks with 802.11a, b, g and n wireless networks./li liSupports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands as well as 20 and 40 MHz channels./li liSignal quality estimations based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)./li liAccurate conversion from dBm to percentage (%) for easier analysis and optimization./li liExport metrics and network details to CSV file format./li liFull screen mode (10.7 or above)./li liComprehensive help./li liRuns in Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion./li /ul  It's available in the Mac App store. It's priced at .99 cents. Developers are responsive to questions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lpDf3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment97274> Does this method show you the signal strength of visible WiFi networks? I can't confirm at the moment. <comment97281> @DanJ it shows Signal/Noise values! <comment97360> yes it shows signal/noise (same as the graphic displays softwares) so you want the signal as high as possible while the noise as low as possible :) I know it is not as fancy as the graphic displays but you do not have to install some 3d party software <comment97455> Can you add some more details about the tool the screenshot is from, where to get it from and why you recommend it? <comment97458> You can see in the top bar that it's NetSpot. I think it might be intended as a response to the recommendation for NetSpot above. I like WiFi Explorer, as the channel view shows you (possible) congestion by frequency. <comment97686> I just tried the NetSpot and showed an example of my neighborhood :), than I UNistalled the netspot since it slows down my computer and as said above OsX already shows the needed information, not in so fancy form, but how often do you care about WiFi landscape, you just want the best signal to connect to and OsX shows that.
