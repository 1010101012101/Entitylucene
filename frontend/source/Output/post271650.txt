Mail servers sporadically dropping out <body> I have an iMac 2015 model, use Mail and have 5 accounts set up on it. Each mail account has been fine until three weeks ago when I changed network provider from Talktalk to Vodafone. I now have an ongoing issue with mail servers sporadically dropping out. Emails get stuck in the outbox and incoming mail is slow to reach me. I'm no expert with computers,but I was advised by someone who is to try connecting to a neighbours network and see what happened. Miraculously all account errors vanished and all worked fine. I have taken online chats with Vodafone and Apple, all port settings/SSL are correct. Vodafone are being very unhelpful claiming that they have no responsibility to third party software providers. Surely a fundamental part of providing internet is that the user can send and receive emails? Has anyone else experienced this?
