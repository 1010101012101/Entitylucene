MacBook Pro: lidwake value ignored? <body> I have a Mid-2014 Macbook Pro Retina running OS X 10.5.5. Unfortunately, I dropped it one too many times, and one of the display hinges has become very stiff. In fact, if I close the lid and then let go, it will spring open about an inch.  This is a problem, but worse is the fact that this wakes my Mac up, draining the battery. I'd like my Mac to go to sleep when I close the lid, but ignore opening the lid, only waking up when I press a key.  Obvious answer: the codelidwake/code value. So, I used codesudo pmset -a lidwake 0/code to set it to zero, closed the lid (it went to sleep), and opened the lid again, anticipating a continued black screen. Wrong, Chucko: it woke up. (Rats.)  On the theory that the settings might not take effect until a reboot, I rebooted. Nope: still wakes on lid opening.  Here's my current pmset settings:  precodembpe:~ griscom$ pmset -g Active Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay         10800  standby              1  womp                 1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  darkwakes            1  gpuswitch            2  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            10  sleep                0  autopoweroffdelay    14400  hibernatemode        3  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         10  acwake               0  lidwake              0 mbpe:~ griscom$  /code/pre  Any idea why a codelidwake/code value of 0 is being ignored? Did support for this end at some point in Mac OS development? How can I keep my Mac from waking up when the lid opens?  <comment372350> When you close the lid place it on the table lid downwards... :) <comment372352> @SolarMike Thanks, I'm doing that when I can, but it doesn't always work (e.g. when I put it in my bag). <comment372358> The real solution will probably be to get the hinge(s) sorted out .
