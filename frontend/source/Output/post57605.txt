How to use drag and drop to move files instead of copying <body> Drag and drop between drives defaults to copying the files not moving them. I know holding kbd⌘/kbd along with the drag will move the files, but I'm looking for something more permanent like a codedefaults/code command, maybe?  I'm using Lion.  <answer59882> I assume there is no codedefaults/code switch for this situation, otherwise someone would have helped already. But using the keyboard, you could strongmove/strong the files like this: kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd, then kbd⌘/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdV/kbd to paste at the desired destination. It’s like cut &amp; paste on Windows, only Mac style. Also, works across volumes!
