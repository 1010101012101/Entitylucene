Paste and Match Style - Default? <body> I find that "Paste and Match Style" is more often useful than just "Paste" when I am copying text. Is there a way to make this the default behavior? The (long) keyboard shortcuts are also inconsistent between applications and difficult to remember. For example:  TextEdit - kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdV/kbd  Chrome - kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdV/kbd  <answer80424> This will do the trick:  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts / Applications/strong./li liClick the strong+/strong button./li liChoose strongAll Applications/strong, from the drop-down list./li liOn the emmenu title/em field add strongthe exact name/strong of the menu bar item./li liPick your keyboard shortcut and click strongAdd/strong./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5yRpj.png" alt="enter image description here"  In case you overwrite the default kbdCommand/kbd+kbdV/kbd shortcut, if the application lacks the emPaste and Match Style/em option, empaste/em will work as usual.  <comment92852> works perfectly! thank you very much
