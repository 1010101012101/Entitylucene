What is the ellipsis badge on minimized terminal app in the dock mean? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eeLtY.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have another terminal window minimized next to it in the dock and it doesn't have the ellipsis. Also it doesn't have any running processes. What does it mean?  <answer63980> See the question Terminal doesn't show badge - how to enable?. In the accepted answer it says:     There is also an "unread text" indicator displayed in tabs, in the   form of ellipsis ("â€¦"):      This is displayed when anything is written to a background terminal, and, like the bell indicator, cleared when you activate that   terminal window/tab. An "unread text" ellipsis is also displayed on   minimized terminal windows in the Dock.
