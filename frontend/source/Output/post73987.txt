Any shortkey for new tweet? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there a way to tweet from a keyboard command?       I want to know, is there any shortcut for creating new tweet in OS X Mountain Lion? If not, how can I define that?  <comment85952> Add a comment if you really want to tweet from Lion. You'll want to edit this to explain exactly how that will work since Lion does not have notification center or a tweeting UI. <comment85953> Sorry, edited. I'm in Mountain Lion. <comment85955> I don't think this is duplicate because I'm in Mountain Lion and I mean native twitter client! <comment85957> OK - let's link to the native client and this might not be a total duplicate with those changes. You see that there's an answer how to do that already if you use this twitter client - http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58205/5472 You will want to explain how your question differs from the linked question for it to get reopen votes.
