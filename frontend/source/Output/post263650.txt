macOS Sierra Version 10.12.1 mail <body> On my MacBook Air mail I have an iCloud and gmail email accounts. What I want to do is either create another email address  with its own mailbox or can I create an alias email address that can have its own inbox to separate messages coming in.  <comment330318> Possible duplicate of [Mail.app: How to use multiple From: addresses for the same Gmail account?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63014/mail-app-how-to-use-multiple-from-addresses-for-the-same-gmail-account) <comment330327> Is this a duplicate? Questioner mentions iCloud and Gmail. "Duplicate" answer only tells you how to do this with Gmail. What if texasbluesman (or another visitor) wants to do this with iCloud?
