App gets in commandline parameter "-psn_0_nnnnnn", why <body> I installed an app which is compatible with OSX 10.10, on 10.8 app shows warning about incorrect parameter:  -psn_0_176171  Why app shows this? it is installed from Dmg file, it's .app file - on desktop.  <answer207917> Pre to OSX 10.9 apps launced in GUI had a -psn parameter passed to them. This was a Carbon system feature.  From this SO answer some documentation is in Apple's ProcessSerialNumber section of the Carbon Process Manager Reference. This is now marked as a retired document and the methods are noted as removed in OS X 10.9   Thus in 10.8 there is a -psn argument passed on the command line and the app then sees this and seems to be confused. I would note a couple of other things a 10.10 app will make calls to functions not in 10.8 so your app will likely crash later, also I suspect the app is reading the command line and this is not the best was as noted in the first link in in the comment by  Graham Miln  <comment250820> Which `app` did you install? <comment250821> This is the **process serial number (PSN)**; see https://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2005/Apr/msg00801.html and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10242115/os-x-strange-psn-command-line-parameter-when-launched-from-finder for details. <comment250822> The psn looks like it was used by Carbon and was removed in OS X 10.9 so a 10.10 app will not expect as -psn argument (This is an answerable question - I can't find a fully definitive reference but from various docs seems consistent) <comment250831> Is this application compatible with MacOS X 10.8?
