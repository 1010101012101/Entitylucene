Updating iphone 4s OS 5.1.1 to ANYTHING more current 6.1.1? 7.0? <body> I have not updated my iphone 4s since the day I got it. I am still on IOS 5.1.1. I jailbroke the phone when i first got it, but the jailbreak was outdated and stopped working so I deleted it off the iphone. If i want to update my IOS can I just backup my files and hit update on my phone or itunes to a more updated IOS ? I do not wish to jailbreak my phone afterwards, I dont need it. My concern was in the past i heard that if you updated your OS with a jailbroken phone, the phone goes into a loop on the restart. I had this happen to my on my iphone 3G.
