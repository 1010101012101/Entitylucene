some apps are not in settings app on iOS <body> I noticed that the apps I developed and tested on my device, doesn't appear in the Settings. Actually a lot of apps are missing there. Why is that?

In order to have settings in the app developer would need to implement separate emSettings.bundle/em in the app. More about emSettings.bundle/em on the Apple Site.
