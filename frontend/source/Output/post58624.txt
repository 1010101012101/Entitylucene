Mountain Lion Messages Facebook Jabber connection problem <body> This is a very weird problem I'm having with my Messages app on Mountain Lion. I have two accounts: a Google Talk and a Jabber account that is linked to my Facebook chat. Whenever I open my Messages app, my connection to Google Talk works just fine, but there is always a connection error with my Facebook account. But my Internet is working fine (like, I'm able to browse to www.facebook.com just fine). It's not an account authorization problem (incorrect username/password), trust me. To fix the problem, I need to go into Preferences - delete my Facebook Jabber account - recreate the account - boom, connection is working fine again.  But, as soon as I log off from my Messages app (by closing it) and re-opening it, the problem re-emerges. Connection to Google Talk works fine, but a connection error with Facebook again. Perhaps this is an issue with Mountain Lion's implementation of Messages; because it is a newer app than the battle-tested iChat, there are still some rough edges needing to be sorted out.  Anyone having any tips regarding this problem?  PS: I did try to look at this question:  iChat + facebook disconnection  <answer59671> I was having the same problem, then I do this:  ul liDisable account./li liGo to emServer Settings tab/em./li liUncheck: emAutomatically find server and por/em./li liUncheck: emUse SSL/em./li liEnable account again./li /ul  Now it works!, my settings:  ul liServer: chat.facebook.com/li liPort: 522/li /ul  <answer59680> These steps fixed the problem for me:  ul liDisable the account./li liCheck 'Automatically find server and port'. /li liEnable the account again./li /ul  <answer107186> To provide the solution I found: Sign in to Facebook on your browser, go to Account Settings  Security  Generate App Password  This will create a unique random password for you to use.  Use THAT password instead of your actual FB password.  Signed right in.  <comment67479> Are you able to solve the problem by just disabling and re-enabling the account? <comment67511> I've had this issue since the beta app. disabling and re-enabling like @jtbandes says works for me though <comment67589> What are the settings you are using in Messages for the facebook account - what server is it pointing at and which checkboxes are enabled? <comment67697> I have the server connections correct: server chat.facebook.com, port 5222. All checkboxes are unchecked! The error messages I keep receiving (in a popup): *Messages lost the connection to the Jabber account “chat.facebook.com”.* _A network error occurred._  Also, I shouldn't have to keep deactivating and reactivating the account in order to make it work. Please tell me if you disagree that doing so would be quite user-unfriendly and annoying. <comment69058> Well...sometimes after doing this, the connection still sometimes barfs up. However, I realized that the quickest way to solve the problem at that point is to simply go to Messages-Accounts-uncheck and recheck chat.facebook.com. This will re-login and we are back! <comment97354> That's bad joke dude, disable SSL for login. And port 522 !? <comment97579> I know, but, doesn't work when I check the SSL options, :S.
