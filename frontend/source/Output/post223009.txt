Navigate to:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes/Contents/Resources /code/pre  To do that easily, press cmd+shift+G, then enter the directory above and press strongGo/strong.  You'll find all the system icons in this folder. Look for the one you want.  <comment270292> The question is not clear? Do you mean the position in pixels? <comment270342> Well,I'm a Chinese, ...I cannot express it in a right way <comment270343> Now what the question asked is what I want to say <comment270355> If ……it was there，I would not ask this question…… <comment270356> There are only LockedIcon.png and unLockedIcon.png in this folder who looks like the icon in the dialogue box <comment270460> @NickJonathan The image in the dialog is probably composed of the finder icon (`/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/Finder.icns`) and the lock icon you mentioned <comment270462> I have I have replaced the icon of Finder.Where is the Lock icon? <comment270465> @NickJonathan The lock icon is LockedIcon.icns .  Arc676 suggests the icon you're looking for is composed using both LockedIcon.icns and FinderIcon.icn . I suggest you create it yourself using photoshop or something. <comment270473> @onlyforthis,no,I know that the icon is composed using some icon and Findericon.icns, but the Lock icon is not LockedIcon,icns in /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes/Contents/Resources <comment270477> @onlyforthis，@Arc676, I want **to find the lock icon instead of the composed icon**, and, the lock icon is at last **128x128px**, while the LockedIcon.incs is **32x32px** in OS X 10.10+
