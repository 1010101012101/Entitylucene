Prevent iPhone "Trust this computer" on work PC <body> I would like to charge my iPhone using a USB plug on my Windows PC at work. However, any time I begin charging with the phone unlocked, it prompts me:     strongTrust This Computer/strongbr   Your settings and data will be accessible from this computer when connected.br   kbdTrust/kbd kbdDon't Trust/kbd   In my case, I never want to trust this PC, and I never want to accidentally click "Trust".br Is there a way to keep the phone from prompting me?  <answer144962> You can buy "charge only" cables.  For examples open Amazon and type "usb charge only cable" in search.   Electrically a "charge only" just connects the power pins, and not the serial date pins between the computer and device.  <comment170785> Great idea. There are also charge-only adapters available that simply drop the two data pins. A quick search on Amazon found them for only a few dollars. <comment170852> Perfect.​​​​​​​ <comment170859> I suppose 15 hours was long enough to wait for any other contenders.  :) <comment251357> Your link is broken. <comment251362> @robert yea links like that do expire...
