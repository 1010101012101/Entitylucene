Is there a iPod touch 1st gen recall program by Apple? <body> I have a iPod touch 1st generation and was about to sell but somebody said to me to get in touch with Apple because apparently they are recalling them and I could get a iPod touch 5th gen? Is this right, and if so how could I do that?  <answer163049> There's no exchange or repair for the 1st Gen iPod touch. Perhaps someone confused the exchange from the 1st gen emnano/em with the emtouch/em  You can find a full list of Apple exchange and extended service plans here:  ul lihttps://www.apple.com/support/exchange_repair//li /ul  A recall means specific things in the US and most other countries and you would see formal advertisements, probably a note on Apple's home page www.apple.com as well as receive email and/or direct postal mail if a product was recalled. The iPod touch hasn't been recalled in the normal sense of that word.  <comment190814> @bmike Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding, but the question is talking about the first gen iPod touch and you are discussing the iPod nano? <comment190817> @jodie and George You're both right - my edit made this worse. I'll fix it now. My apologies. <comment190818> I'm very confused as I was about to sell my iPod touch first generation and a friend told me they are recalling and replacing with a newer version I'm not talking about the iPod nano thanks <comment190822> @bmike No problem, I got a hat! <comment190824> @grgarside Mullet or hairboat? I'm now jealous and wondering who I need to piss off to get a down vote somewhere. :-) <comment190826> @bmike Mullet, haha :)
