iOS: some updates do not get processed <body> I started experiencing a weird phenomenon after updating to 10.3. I have my apps set to auto-update. This used to work fine. When I went to the App Store, I would see some apps had updates. If I left the iPhone on WiFi and plugged in, all those apps would be updated after a few hours. Now, I see some updates ready, but then after a few hours, I still have some remaining. The phone is plugged in, fully charged, and on WiFi. There is no reason all updates should not be complete. Free space is not an issue.  One possible solution I tried is signing in and out from the "iTunes and App Store", but that did not solve the problem. Regardless, some updates go through, so the update process is partially working. If I keep waiting, all the updates go through, but by that time, more accumulate, so I always have more updates pending. This has been happening for many days now.
