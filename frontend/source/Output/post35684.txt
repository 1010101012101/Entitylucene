How can I install Debian on a PowerBook G3 with Mac OS 9.2? <body> Today I started installing Debian Linux on an old Macintosh PowerBook G3 with Mac OS 9.2. After a long time of backing up old documents I erased the whole disk. At the end I just want Debian installed, so I did that. Than I've burned a Debian CD (DVD won't work) and inserted it into the PowerBook. I wanted to boot from this CD with pressing kbdC/kbd at boot, but I always just get a big question mark on the screen.br Please help me, because I already tried more than a hour with booting the disk and it never worked.  <answer35715> According to this how to article:  You'll need a working OS X partition and you'll need to reboot with kbdOption/kbd + kbdCommand/kbd + kbdO/kbd + kbdF/kbd. It is a bit complicated so follow the link for more info.  I personally would go with Ubuntu on your Powerbook. Follow this guide for info on how to install. Although the guide is for a Power Mac G4, it should work with your Powerbook.  <comment40671> http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1440 <comment40673> Yes I now that this is because I deleted the original systeme, but how can I install the Linux from the disk? <comment40720> Thanks for the link, I'll try it like described. <comment40760> @leo Ok, lemme know how it works out.

I'm sure I'll try it again in the next days, but currently I really haven't got the time for that :). <comment41863> Ok, lemme know if you need any more help!
