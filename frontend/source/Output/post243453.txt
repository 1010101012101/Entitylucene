Why (else) would my Calendar icon have a red badge (with numbers) on it? <body> Supposedly, the red badge that shows up on the Calendar icon in the app switcher (and the Dock, if anyone still uses that) represents invitations that you've not dealt with.  That's a nice theory, but I have no invitations waiting for me to act on, and I still have a red badge with a "3" in it.  I realize that I can disable the badge, but that seems like taking a hammer and smashing the light on the dashboard, instead of figuring out why it is lit up.    I want to know what (other than invitations waiting) could cause a red badge to show up on the Calendar.app icon.  If this is a bug (e.g. where Calendar is failing update its count of invitations) is there any way to fix it?  Is there any way to reset it?  If it's not a bug, what other entities get counted besides invitations?  <comment299825> Do you have any events with reminders setup? Does the Calendar app have any entries in Notification Center? Also, in my experience, badges are prone to weird bugs; you could try force-closing the app and restarting it or rebooting your phone. <comment299853> It also shows if another party added or changed an event on a shared Calendar. However, if there is nothing showing in the Calendar's top bar concerning that, then my guess is it's a ghost. Try killing the Dock & see if it goes away. In terminal `killall -KILL Dock`
