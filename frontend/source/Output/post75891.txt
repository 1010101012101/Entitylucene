How can I completely remove Apple's Java 6 and make Oracle's Java 7 default for everything? <body> I would like to completely remove Apple's Java 6 and make Oracle's Java 7 default for every program. For example, with Eclipse I had to fiddle with eclipse.ini to specify JAVA_HOME for Java 7, and the same for TunnelBear. No luck for Aptana, though (it still wants Apple's Java) Is there a way to make Oracle's Java default in terms of PATH?  <answer76119> Well, if you install the latest Java update from Apple, that should actually uninstall Java 6. You can go to Oracle's website directly to download Java 7. That's what I did. With only Java 7 on your system, that should make it default.  <answer83153> Download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle, which will place it in code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_11.jdk/code (or whatever the latest version is). Now, start Terminal.app, and enter the following commands:  ol licodecd /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/code (change to the proper directory)/li licodesudo mv 1.6.0.jdk backup.1.6.0.jdk/code (keep the old JDK around, just in case - you will need to have an administrator password to do this)/li licodesudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_11.jdk 1.6.0.jdk/code (link your new JDK installation to where applications expect the old one to be)/li /ol  Keep in mind that with any further jdk updates, you'll need to update the symlink to the new directory:   precodesudo rm /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk &amp;&amp; sudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/new_jdk_version /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk /code/pre  <answer138916> These instructions worked well for me on OS X Mavericks.  ul liRemove Apple's JVMs  precode$ sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ /code/pre/li liRemove installer records  precode$ sudo rm /private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.JavaForMacOSX* /code/pre/li liRemove installer receipts (delete the code&lt;dict&gt;...&lt;/dict&gt;/code entries that reference com.apple and java)  precode$ sudo emacs /Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist /code/pre/li liSet the symlinks for Java 7  precode$ sudo rm /usr/bin/java $ sudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/bin/java /code/pre/li liOptionally symlink codeJAVA_HOME/code  precodesudo rm /Library/Java/Home sudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_17.jdk/Contents/Home /Library/Java/Home /code/pre/li /ul  <answer232997> I know this is an old thread, but if one has Adobe CS5 on their machine, it MUST HAVE the Apple 1.6 version of java for the suite to run. I was running Eclipse which needed 1.7 or higher. I thought it would replace the Apple version, but it didn't. The Apple version is in the System/Library folder and the Oracle version is in the Library folder.  Thought I would add a bit more info for those who may need this information.  OS X Lion  <comment93709> On Lion the Java update did not uninstall Apple's java - /usr/bin/java is now Java 7 but Java 6 is still useable as `/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java` <comment93710> I think Java 7 is the default for PATH as /usr/bin/java should be Java 7 . However the issue is with .apps having something else in their .plist files <comment97037> I'm using Java 7 only and getting Apple updates on Java is somewhat tedious. I want it out - anyone managed to have it that way, yet? (i.e. so much out that Apple wouldn't push Java-specific updates; I'm fine taking all through Oracle directly). <comment178752> You shouldn't create the 1.6.x symlink, application won't be expecting the jdk to be in /System. If anything you should set JAVA_HOME in your profile. <comment284789> That info is in the other answers <comment285057> Didn't check. Sorry.
