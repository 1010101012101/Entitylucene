How do I press Control + Alt + KP4 on an Apple Wireless Keyboard - French? <body> I have an Apple Wireless Keyboard - French.   Could anyone tell me which shortcut is for the number lock? kbdclear/kbd or kbdF6/kbd as suggested somewhere does not seem to work.  Also, where are number keys when the number keyboard is on?  Finally, how to press kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdKP4/kbd  <comment55894> Are you sure it *has* a number keypad? I know the US version hasn't had one for quite a while, and that doesn't look like it does either.
