"System" storage on macOS Sierra is 470GB! <body> My Mid 2012 MacBook Pro 13" says I suddenly ran out of Storage space.   My Mac barely has any data and my upgrade to Sierra was a clean install. Nothing was ported from previous backups.   If you see the image below, the "System" section in the left column says that it is consuming 466.82 GB. What I don't understand is why does my Mac require so much space? As far as I know, it should never increase 50 GB of space. Any help is appreciated.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QqFow.png" alt="image here"  <answer261255> Download OmniDiskSweeper and analyze your hard drive.     OmniDiskSweeper will show you the files on your drive, in descending   order by size, and letting you decide what to do with them. Delete   away, but exercise caution.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/94hIu.png" alt="enter image description here"   OmniDiskSweeper will show detail of space usage:  Select System and start cleaning.  It could be the Time Machine backup file that takes almost all the free space.  <answer290988> Your system may need to reindex the file system to correctly show disk usage amounts.  Indexing is handled by Spotlight.  Using system preferencesspotlight, add your drive to the list of folders not to index for privacy reasons.  Reboot and then remove that entry.  Your computer will be slow during the reindex process, but after it should show the appropriate amounts.  As for figuring out where your disk is being weighed down, I like to use Grand Perspective.  http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/  It gives a visual graph of the files you have and how large they are.
