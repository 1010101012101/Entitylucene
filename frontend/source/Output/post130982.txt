How do I set the swipe function to "trash" rather than "archive" for my Gmail inbox in iOS 7? <body> I have two IMAP email accounts on my iPhone 5S running iOS7.   With the iCloud account, I can perform an easy emswipe left/em gesture and select "trash" for individual emails (see first image, black boxes added for redaction):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/icpuW.jpg" alt="iCloud account"  However, using the same gesture in my Gmail inbox, I'm presented with "Archive" rather than "Trash" (see screen capture below). From here I have to hit "More  Move Message...  Trash" to delete it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FlxyN.jpg" alt="Gmail Account"  strongHow do I set either my Gmail preferences or iPhone Mail preferences to mimic the behavior of the iCloud account's "Trash" option when I swipe?/strong  <answer130984> Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calenders - GMail - Account - Advance  Move discarded messages into: Deleted Mailbox  <comment153750> I additionally had to change "Archive Mailbox" to "On the Server" vs "On my iPhone" for some reason, but this answered my question and all is working as desired. Thanks. <comment153791> np, my pleasure :) <comment161595> Why was this question downvoted...?
