macOS Sierra 10.12.4 Finder scroll issue <body> After upgrading to MacOS Sierra, it seems that the top 3 file names in the Finder window (in column view) are hidden. I can scroll momentarily to see them but then of course the scroll bounces back up and hides them from view, rendering them unselectable.   Any suggestions on how to resolve it?   <comment358407> Share a screenshot on what happens?
