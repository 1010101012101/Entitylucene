Running GNU Screen with 256 colors on OS X Lion <body> Terminal.app in Mac OS X Lion has a feature that took a long time to get implemented: 256 color support. The colors work fine. The issue I'm having is that when I run GNU Screen I do not have access to 256 colors. In screen, $TERM is set to "screen".  I've read different things in different places and am very confused. Some of these include:  ul liGNU Screen must be compiled with color support (How can I tell if OS X's screen was compiled this way?)/li liA special terminfo file for screen-256color must be installed. Does OS X have this?/li liIn .screenrc, term should be set to "screen-256color"./li liCertain functions in Emacs must be called for Emacs to be colorful (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnuScreen#toc6)/li /ul  I tried variations of these procedures and have been unsuccessful and uncertain of why I have failed. What is the most direct way for me to enable 256 colors in GNU Screen?  <answer46855> Add the following to your code~/.screenrc/code  precodeterm "screen-256color" /code/pre  And then try, it should work.   <answer46857> By default, codescreen/code is not aware that it is running in a 256-color-capable codexterm/code. To make programs in codescreen/code recognize this feature, you need to set a couple of things in your code~/.screenrc/code:  precodeterm "screen-256color" # terminfo and termcap for nice 256 color terminal # allow bold colors - necessary for some reason attrcolor b ".I"  # tell screen how to set colors. AB = background, AF=foreground  termcapinfo xterm 'Co#256:AB=\E[48;5;%dm:AF=\E[38;5;%dm'  # erase background with current bg color  defbce "on"  /code/pre  If this doesn’t work for you, your version of codescreen/code probably wasn’t compiled with code./configure --enable-colors256/code. You can check this in the welcome screen when starting codescreen/code. strongThe default version that comes with OS X doesn’t support 256 colors./strong You could check out the source and compile your own version, putting the resulting binary in your code$PATH/code (I put it in code~/bin/code which I added to my code$PATH/code):  precodegit clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/screen.git cd screen/src ./autogen.sh ./configure --enable-colors256 make   # I got a lot of warnings here, but they don't seem to matter sudo make install cp screen ~/bin/screen /code/pre  Sources: 1 and 2  <comment44717> @PaulR You're right, but it's a good question nevertheless. <comment53883> Thank you very much. This issue has been irritating me for so long. Someone at Apple thought it was a good idea to ship a terminal emulator with 256 colours and a terminal multiplexer with 8 haha! <comment53916> FWIW, I reported this as a bug at [bugreport.apple.com](http://bugreport.apple.com/), so hopefully this will get fixed in Mountain Lion. <comment87510> FWIW this is all I needed in 10.7.5 and 10.8.2. <comment102194> Homebrew users: [homebrew-dupes](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes) has [a recipe for screen](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/blob/master/screen.rb) including `--enable-colors256`.      $ brew tap homebrew/dupes  # if you haven't already     $ brew install screen <comment120562> @tvon I can't get it work on my OSX 10.7.5. Any idea why?
