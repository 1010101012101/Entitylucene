How to disable all iOS notifications temporarily? <body> I use my iPad a lot as I teach, showing the students slides, videos, etc.  Having a words with friends, draw something, or email notification, especially with personal content in the first line, show up is always distracting.  I see that I can change notification settings per-app, but don't see  a way to disable all notifications system wide. Disabling apps individually works, but requires a bit of effort and time, and isn't something that can be done mid-lesson.  Is there a way to disable all notifications, then re-enable them without fiddling with each one individually?  <answer50587> Unfortunately, I don't think there's any way to disable all notifications at once in iOS 5. There is no global toggle switch (like there was in iOS 4).  Hopefully Apple will change this in the future!  All I can suggest is that you send Apple feedback.  <answer50601> If you don't need a internet connection during the lesson a simple solution would be to just switch into airplane mode or to disable the Wi-Fi.  <answer275067> After years, Apple provided a way of achieving this.  It is called the "strongDo Not Disturb/strong" feature, available since iOS 10.  ref: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321  <comment57993> Most apps only trigger notifications while running in the background. Maybe quitting these applications is a better alternative than reconfiguring the notification center? <comment57996> Unfortunately this is the only way to disable them "globally" although it won't change local notifications such as Due.app. iOS 5 simply doesn't provide a global off switch. Yes, I find it annoying too. <comment58034> This is an interesting solution, and for some cases would work well enough. <comment218433> Note that this would no longer be sufficient due to new app notifications that can be presented without an outside (internet) trigger. <comment218520> Since iOS7 there is a global switch to disable all notifications. Just turn **Do Not Disturb** on. However, it only makes them silent.
