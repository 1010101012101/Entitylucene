Git auto-completion not working on Mac OSX 10.11.5 El Capitan <body> I have tried the examples found here to get Git auto-completion working on El Capitan, however none of the examples work for me.   I installed codebash-completion/code with Homebrew (codebrew install bash-completion/code).  This is my code~/.bash_profile/code currently (as you can see, i've tried a few things):  precodeCRMPiccosMacBook:etc crmpicco$ cat ~/.bash_profile  alias ll='ls -lG' alias composer="php /usr/local/bin/composer.phar"  #if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then #   . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion #fi  if [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash ]; then     . `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash fi  #source /usr/local/git/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash #GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=true #export PS1='[\u@mbp \w$(__git_ps1)]\$ ' /code/pre  So, if I go into my directory with the cloned Git repo and type codegit checkout m/code and hit [TAB] I get nothing (when expecting codemaster/code to be pre-filled).  When I run a codesource/code on it, it doesn't exist - however it's installed.   precodeCRMPiccos-MacBook:signup crmpicco$ brew install bash-completion Warning: bash-completion-1.3_1 already installed CRMPiccos-MacBook:signup crmpicco$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash -bash: /etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash: No such file or directory /code/pre  <answer245324> You are confusing the basic bash completion with the add on required for completing git commands.  The codegit/code that is installed by Apple lacks the required codegit-completion.bash/code file so you need to install the full git. You can do this easily with homebrew -codebrew install git/code will do the job.  Once you've done that then uncomment your top three lines :-  code if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then    . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion fi /code  Now codesource ~/.bash_profile/code and it should work fine.  <comment345670> I did exactly what you said, Tony, but it still does not work <comment345925> The steps you need are :- (1) Install `bash-completion` using homebrew (2) install `git` using homebrew. (3) add the lines above to your `.bash_profile`. Now open a new Terminal window and you should find git completion working.
