How can I make ctrl+right/left arrow stop changing Desktops in Lion? <body> kbd⌃ Control/kbd+kbd→/kbd and kbd⌃ Control/kbd+kbd←/kbd switches desktops.   I actually had this enabled in Spaces on Snow Leopard, but I'd like to turn this off because I use those key combinations when editing in Eclipse. How do I turn this off?  <answer18062> Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Mission Control and change the settings for "Move left a space" and "Move right a space" or disable them completely.  <comment19730> Outstanding!  I was convinced there was no way to turn this off.  Thanks! <comment227304> Check one in the win column for @rene, works on Yosemite 10.10 <comment266076> Any idea of how to automate this with a `defaults write` command suited for a dotfiles file to immediately fix this on blasting a new mac for use, à la https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx? <comment342781> Thanks this was driving me nuts when I was RDP'd into a Windows box from my Mac and using CTRL+arrow keys to move around a text editor.
