CM storm devastator backlight <body> Im reposting another users question because I have the same problem but am brand new to the site and I dont have any reputation to answer/comment.I have gotten the keyboard to light up using xcode and stopping it when its lit, but I want to set a key shortcut to use it easier.  OP:  I have a CM Storm Devastator and cannot get the backlight working on Mac. I have followed the instructions below :  Go here:   https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/HID_LED_test_tool/Introduction/Intro.html  Click the little "Download sample code" button  Open the downloaded folder and go to Build / Release  Drag the HID LED test tool file to your Applications folder  Launch the OS X "Automator" program  Choose "Service" document type  Under "Library", click "Utilities", and drag "Run Shell Script" to the blank area / workflow pane. For "selected service receives" choose "no input" in "any application" (important) For "pass input" choose "as arguments" (important) For "shell" choose "/bin/bash" Paste in this script:  precode/Applications/HID\ LED\ test\ tool &amp; pid=$! sleep 3 kill $pid /code/pre  Click "run" to test. After 3 seconds, your keyboard should remain in a state with num lock and scroll lock enabled, and all the keys should be lit up. Yay! Continue to assign keyboard shortcut to do this.  Click "File"  "Save", "Save service as" : "Devastator LED Lighter"  Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services  General  "Devastator  LED Lighter"  Assign a shortcut. Scroll lock and F keys didn't work for me. I ended up choosing "  The problems I have encountered:  The downloaded file is called "HID_LED_test_tool". This contains 3 files  HID LED test tool-Read Me.txt  HID LED test tool.xcodeproj  main.c  Problem: it does not contain a build/release folder, so I dragged HID LED test tool.xcodeproj into the Applications folder.  I followed all the instructions above renaming the HID LED... file to a simple HID. The problem is that when I run the automator program as indicated above I get the reply xxxxx is a directory. I cannot get around this; I have tried extracting the file within the HID LED test tool folder and then executing the automator with that file name but the exact same thing happens ....  When I attempt to open the project.pbxproj file in Terminal I get the response :  precodeLast login: Sat Feb  7 19:34:21 on ttys000 /Applications/HID\ LED\ test\ tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj ; exit; Zakias-MacBook-Pro:~ zakia$ /Applications/HID\ LED\ test\ tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj ; exit; /Applications/HID LED test tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: line 1: //: is a directory /Applications/HID LED test tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: line 3: archiveVersion: command not found /Applications/HID LED test tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: line 4: classes: command not found /Applications/HID LED test tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: line 6: objectVersion: command not found /Applications/HID LED test tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: line 7: objects: command not found /Applications/HID LED test tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: line 9: /Applications: is a directory /Applications/HID LED test tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: line 10: syntax error near unexpected token `(' /Applications/HID LED test tool.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: line 10: `       8DD76F770486A8DE00D96B5E /* main.c in Sources */ = {isa = PBXBuildFile; fileRef = 08FB7796FE84155DC02AAC07 /* main.c */; settings = {ATTRIBUTES = (); }; };' logout   [Process completed] /code/pre  <comment235025> you have enough reputation to answer the question directly. <comment235075> Do I now?
