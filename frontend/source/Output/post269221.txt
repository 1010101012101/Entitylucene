Unable to burn playlist to disc <body> Why can I not burn a playlist to disc in iTunes.  I highlighted the data I want to burn.  When I go to file, the dropdown to burn the playlist to disc is grayed out.  I have a portable CD/DVD writer as my new computer does not allow discs.  I can watch movies, etc., so I know it works.  <comment338209> Do you have a disk in the CD/DVD writer? <comment373703> IIRC, you can only burn .mp3 files that reside in your iTunes Library.
