How to hide Photos from iOS <body> The new emOS X Photos App/em allows to emhide/em photos. emHidden/em photos will only appear in the codeHidden/code album (or in any album which you explicitly added them to).  However, the emHidden/em photos keep showing on the emiOS Photos App/em. emiOS/em detects they are hidden, but it merely hides them from the image picker controller on third party apps. They can still be viewed in the main emPhotos App/em on the emAll Photos/em section. Is there any way to hide them from emAll Photos/em as well?  <answer206900> No. Hiding photos on iOS prevents them from displaying in Moments, Collections, and Years, but they will continue to show in any of the albums under "Albums".   Unfortunately, short of deleting them and then restoring them within 30 days, you are limited to the provision that Apple developed.   <comment249451> That's what I thought. Thanks.
