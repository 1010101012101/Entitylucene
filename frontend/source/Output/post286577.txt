Connecting to a new WiFi network <body> In iOS 10, is there an easy way to connect to a new WiFi network if automatic connect is turned off? I turned that off because it's way too annoying.   So right now, connecting is a multi-step process going through the Settings app. Am I missing a hidden way to do that from the start screen.  <answer286584> If it's a new wifi network, the only way to connect (not including any 3rd-party app) is to go thru codeSettings -&gt; Wi-Fi/code.  If you're open to 3rd-party solutions, perhaps you can edit your question to add that?
