Where are the alert tone audio files located in OS X? <body> In what directory on OS X are the sound files located for the alert tones in Messages and in FaceTime? I'm not talking about the alert sounds in System Preferences; I mean the ones that are also on iOS—like Aurora, Bamboo, Chord, etc.—in the list in this screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vmmqL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210074> Alerts are located atbr code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AlertTones//codebr Ringtones inbr code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Ringtones//code   If you're looking to add your own - you can't.... or rather you can but they will be ignored.  I've found the best method to add my own is to replace one of the existing sounds with one of my own, renamed to match.br See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/169907/85275  For completeness... System alerts - Sosumi etc - are in code/System/Library/Sounds//codebr User sounds are in code~/Library/Sounds//code  <comment253479> Thanks—you led me to the right containing directory! But you are just one folder off. Will you please update your answer to the correct directory `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AlertTones` and I'll accept it. :) <comment253480> tweaking . . .. <comment253481> I was looking for them so I can match the volume level of the tones I create for iOS. Based on my precursory examination, they seem to be around -12db on average.
