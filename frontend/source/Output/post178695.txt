Can I run my MacBook Pro on just AC power? <body> I have a used little MacBook Pro 13 inch Late 2008 5,1 and I was told it needed a battery. It charges, then it doesn't, and it shuts off at the most random times, so the thought occurred to me to take the battery out and run it straight from AC power.   It worked without a problem for a bit, then it just shut down. It would not come back on until I plugged the battery in to it.  Do I need to keep a battery in my MacBook Pro in order to run it off A/C power?  <answer178703> For some operations certain models require more power than the Power Supply alone can deliver at a given time. For this incident it relies on additional power from the battery. It is to be assumed that that is your machines issue. You'll probably need to get that battery replaced. The price is usually between 120-150 at an Apple Certified Repair Center in Austria.   *My information is based on statements from AppleCare and their internal chat service for Certified Technicians.  <answer178743> According to Everymac's MacBook Pro listing, there is no such thingsup1/sup as a MacBook Pro 13" Late 2008 5,1. The earliest 13" MacBook Pro was a June [Mid] 2009 5,5. The smallest Late 2008 5,1 model was only 15". To clear things up:  ul liMaybe you mean MacBook and not MacBook Pro?/li liIs it a Unibody model, or Pre-Unibody?/li liIs it really a 13" or 15"?/li liIs your battery integrated? That is to say, can you easily remove the battery without opening the case up using a screwdriver?/li /ul  Please clarify your question, and specify the correct MacBook [Pro] model. If you could provide a link to the model on the Everymac site, that would be useful. The more accurate the information you provide, the more accurate the answer. As Kevin Grabher implies in his answer, each model is different, and behaves differently.  Regardless, I have been running a 17" 2.4GHz MacBook Pro Mid/Late 2007, Santa Rosa model, 3,1 which for all intents and purposes as the same as an early 2008 4,1 (power wise) without a battery for two years, without an issue.  hr  sup1/sup If the Everymac site is wrong, and you do indeed have a 13"" MacBook Pro 5,1 then I apologise.  <comment211789> The only MacBook Pro that Apple marketed as 2008 are 15 and 17" - see https://support.apple.com/specs/#macbookpro and page back to that era. Could you edit this to link to the specifications of your Mac? You can also use the serial number at this page - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201608 <comment211818> Hi matt - welcome to SE Ask Different.
