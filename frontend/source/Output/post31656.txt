How do I move my iPhone contacts to Gmail? <body> I have an iPhone that is already synced with my iMac, but I am away on leave and am using a Windows 7 computer. I need to send the contacts I've created on my iPhone to my Gmail account online, because I am going to update my iPhone's operating system and want to be sure I do not lose the contacts on my phone. I know I will probably lose my music, but that's okay.  <answer31658> Look at this thread in Google forums.   My personal best way to sync with Google is iTunes (without Mac OS X) or AddressBook.app (on Mac OS X) at the moment.  Some answers are below, but have a look to the page:  ul li(iCloud control panel for Windows)/li liYou have to stop sharing your contacts in iCloud, and then preferences you sync Address book as you did before and sync with iTunes/li liExport contacts from GMail &amp; import them into Address Book and then… merge yourself./li liSet up your Gmail contacts via Exchange on your iPhone. http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740 . This is the only way I know of to actually synchronize your Gmail Contacts to your iPhone directly from Gmail’s servers over the Internet via Push./li liThird-party services like Soocial, NuevaSync and others./li liThird-party programs for your phone/li /ul  <answer47591> As I understand your contacts are not on iCloud, but just synced locally with your Mac. What I would do is to share them to Gmail from your Mac: Preferences  On my Mac  synchronize with Google.  That way you'll have two ways syncing between Gmail and your Mac + your Mac will sync with your iPhone.  <answer47617> I am assuming that the Windows 7 iTunes display of Devices frame.  In iTunes → Devices (the side bar) → Select your iPhone device → Info tab (at the top) → Sync Contacts click/check strongSync Google Contacts/strong and click strongConfigure.../strong to enter your Gmail account info.  <answer53339> This may work for you.  You can get an iCloud account free using your iPhone. or the via the PC. You can sync your contacts to the iCloud. From there you can export all your contacts out as a strongvCard/strong file from the iCloud Addressbook web interface. Then in gmail import the file.

If you would like to keep your existing contacts on your device select the Keep on my iPhone (or iPad or iPod touch) option when prompted. This will also allow you to keep syncing with your computer via iTunes. If you choose to keep existing contacts, you will sync the contents of the My Contacts group.  13b.
