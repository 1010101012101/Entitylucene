OS X kernel panic on boot with "unable to find driver for this platform" <body> I updated the latest version of OS X yesterday. When I updated this it asked me to restart and displayed "unexpected error" and asked to restart again. When I restarted it the following screen showed and it hasn't been working since. I get the same screen every time. My Mac is a MacBook Pro 13â€³. It was bought in America and I'm currently in India.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFR6v.jpg" alt="Kernel Panic"  <comment136638> Boot to internet recovery and reinstall th OS?
