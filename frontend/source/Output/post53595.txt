Can I use AirportExpress model A1088 to connect to TimeCapsule for AirTunes only? <body> I have a home wireless setup running on TimeCapsule (network on n). I would love to have AirTunes and it happens that a friend of mine can give me an old AirportExpress base station. However, this being an old b/g version (model A1088) I am not sure whether I can use it.   I don't need to extend my wireless, I can connect AiportExpress with TimeCapsule using the cable and I only want to use AE for AirTunes (to connect to my stereo), nothing else. Can I do it?  thanks! yot  <answer54238> Simple and direct answer is yes if you plan to use the ethernet connection. Beware that you will need to download the old configuration utility here to change the settings on this model.
