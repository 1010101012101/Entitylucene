DVD to iMovie converter for Mac 10.4.11 <body> First of all, is there such a thing? All I want to do is be able to import film clips from DVDs into iMovie so I can make groovy youtube videos. Any suggestions for a Mac 10.4.11 user?  <answer7584> You have so many choices on OS X. Here it goes, take a look at this tutorial link for your question answered step by step.  Other excellent (and easy!) software to use are:  -iRip it from The Little App Factory  -Permute from Fuel Collective  -iFlicks from Jendrick Bertrambr I translated the last one in French for...French users ;)  Hope this will help you!  <answer7619> I use HandBrake. It's free and open, and works nicely.  <answer7633> MacTheRipper also does a decent job of this, although the author makes it deliberately hard to get hold of. You need to join the forums at http://www.ripdifferent.com/forum to get download instructions.  <answer32787> Rip the DVD to an iMovie supported video format such as mov or mp4.   <comment37522> The question refers to OSX 10.4, the tool here requires Lion :-( <comment82399> This question specifically asks for a solution in OS X Tiger.
