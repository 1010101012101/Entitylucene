Safari SharePoint Plugin not working <body> I have a strange problem with SharePoint and Safari.  ul liWith 10.9 I was able to click on a file in a SharePoint site and it was opened in the corresponding Office application./li liAfter the upgrade to 10.10 the feature disappeared. /li liWith 10.11.0 it began to work again/li liWith 10.11.1 it stopped (and it is still not working with 10.11.2)/li /ul  The SharePoint plugin seems installed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SuySC.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I have other machines with the same version (10.11.2) where it does work.  <comment265015> Based on previous empirical evidenceâ€¦ try 10.11.2  ;) <comment265016> Hi I edited the question. It is still not working but not on all the machines. I don't think that the OS Version is the only reason. There must be something else: given that on other machines with the same version it works ... <comment265018> Sorry, I was really just being flippant :) The only thing I could think would be to un/reinstall the plug, or make sure it's the latest version.
