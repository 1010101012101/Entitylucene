How can I really disable the Cmd to Win key mapping in Parallels Desktop 5? <body> Removed it from codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard/code. No go.br Remapped kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd to be kbdCtrl/kbd. No go.br Ripping out the kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd key shouldn't be the solution. Anyone?...  <answer375> You can use Krumstick to remap the windows key inside Windows.  <answer376> Go to Parallels Desktop preferences and disable key mapping for key which behaves abnormally ("Cmd  win" in our case) as shown on the screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1J247.png" alt="alt text"  <answer1291> It works for me, but I have it remapped like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/49IPp.png" alt="Parallels Keys"  So cmd is really control for Windows.   <answer92031> I found that mapping a different key to the kbdWin/kbd command did not remove the kbdCmd/kbd key being mapped to kbdWin/kbd.  What worked for me was to map kbdCmd/kbd to kbdShift/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEDKg.png" alt="Cmd key mapped to Win key"  All the other shortcuts such as kbdCmd/kbd + kbdS/kbd (save), kbdCmd/kbd + kbdC/kbd (copy), etc still worked but hitting kbdCmd/kbd by itself now just activates the kbdShift/kbd key which really does nothing by itself.  <comment343> I already disabled it and it doesn't have any effect. Does it work for you? BTW, I'm running 5.0.9370. <comment344> Thanks. Will probably do that if I don't find anything on the Mac side... <comment174692> I can verify that this is a valid solution for Parallels 10 with Windows 8.1. <comment175451> This works but has the unfortunate consequence of disabling ⌘+C for copy etc on my machine (Yosemite, Parallels 10, Windows 8). Instead I mapped ⌘ to Ctrl. <comment175529> @philwilks Check that you still have ⌘+C mapped in the window shown above. <comment291839> Agreed, this solution is great, but mapping to `Control` might be better.  The Copy/Paste shortcuts are set separately anyway so it doesn't appear to mess anything up either way.  So glad the Dumb Start menu doesn't appear any more when I show my desktop!  Works on Parallels Desktop 10.
