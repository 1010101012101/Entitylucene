"say" in different language? <body> Are there voices in different languages installed in Mac OS X? E.g. spanish, french or slovak? (latest iPod Nano built-in voiceover has beautiful slovak voice, I'd like to try it on Mac OS X too)  <answer3465> As far as I know the only way to get a Mac to speak in another language is to get voice resources in your target language. A web site for French blind people recommends iVox.  Sorry, no Slovak there I can see.  <answer3471> The voices included in Mac OS X 10.6 are optimized for english only. Even if you set your system language to anything different, it won’t work, because it will try to read with english pronunciation, causing funny wordings. Try saying “Hola” for spanish and you’ll see how it says: “hooola” as an english speaking person would read it.   <answer9418> Lion has many more voices, including Czech (Zuzana) and Slovak voice (Laura)!  <answer34927> It might be a bit hard to find the international for OS X Lion, this shows how...  http://www.litebeam.net/litebeam/read4me/voices.html  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=RUI5d5L_wr8  <answer93172> For Mac OS X 10.7, Swedish works pretty well by just downloading the Swedish voices using Preferences-System Voice-Customize and setting either as System Voice. It neatly nails even pretty peculiar Swedish words and spellings.  No guarantee for other languages.  <answer220397> You can use the following command in the Terminal to get a list of all the available voices:  precodesay -v ? /code/pre  On my system the output looks like this with the voice name followed by the language abbreviation (I removed the comments):     Agnes en_US      Albert    en_US      Alex  en_US      Alice it_IT      Alva  sv_SE      Amelie    fr_CA      Anna  de_DE      Bad   News      Bahh  en_US      Bells en_US      Boing en_US      Bruce en_US      Bubbles   en_US      Carmit    he_IL      Cellos    en_US      Damayanti id_ID      Daniel    en_GB      Deranged  en_US      Diego es_AR      Ellen nl_BE      Fiona en-scotland      Fred  en_US      Good  News      Hysterical    en_US      Ioana ro_RO      Joana pt_PT      Junior    en_US      Kanya th_TH      Karen en_AU      Kathy en_US      Kyoko ja_JP      Laura sk_SK      Lekha hi_IN      Luciana   pt_BR      Maged ar_SA      Mariska   hu_HU      Mei-Jia   zh_TW      Melina    el_GR      Milena    ru_RU      Moira en_IE      Monica    es_ES      Nora  nb_NO      Paulina   es_MX      Pipe  Organ      Princess  en_US      Ralph en_US      Samantha  en_US      Sara  da_DK      Satu  fi_FI      Sin-ji    zh_HK      Tessa en_ZA      Thomas    fr_FR      Ting-Ting zh_CN      Trinoids  en_US      Veena en_IN      Vicki en_US      Victoria  en_US      Whisper   en_US      Xander    nl_NL      Yelda tr_TR      Yuna  ko_KR      Zarvox    en_US      Zosia pl_PL      Zuzana    cs_CZ   This is an example on how to use say with a german voice, as suggested by scottishwildcat in the comments:  precodesay -v Anna "Guten Tag!" /code/pre  <comment3319> Thanks for sharing the link to iVox. At least there is czech voice, I'll try it. <comment20391> There are a lot new voices in 10.7 (e.g. the Danish one I've been playing with). <comment20398> @Thorbjørn: that's right, and that's what I've said in my answer as well. High-quality voices for "free", what's not to like? <comment20401> Peter, consider accepting one of the original answers and add a note to your question instead of adding an answer much later and accepting that. <comment20413> @Thorbjørn: until today, Martins answer was the accepted one. But I don't think it's the best one today. I don't think that changing accepted answer is the wrong practice, but I may reconsider this position. <comment109322> same for german. I just got a bit overboard and downloaded all the voices - they need a huge space on the drive and no documented way of removing them. So maybe just download one by one. <comment144589> Yes, this. Then if you want to use it from the Terminal, you can write:  `say -v Laura "Dobrý deň"` <comment280398> Also worth mentioning you can then use "say -v voicename" to use one of those voices, without changing the system preference. For example, `say -v Whisper "Now I am whispering"`. <comment293822> This should be the accepted answer. <comment294025> @letitbee  maybe the guy who ask the question 6 years ago will come back and delete his answer so he can follow your advice:-) <comment294141> @TomGewecke No doubt my friend, no doubt. That will happen!
