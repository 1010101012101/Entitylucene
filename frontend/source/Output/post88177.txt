What is the maximum resolution for a second monitor attached to a MBP Retina? <body> I'm curious if my new machine will support (for example) 3840x2400 retina-quality external monitor in additional to the built-in screen or whether that will exceed the capacity of the video card.  <answer88182> I don't have any direct experience with this so YMMV, but some research suggests that the maximum supported total resolution of Thunderbolt is 3840 x 2400 WQUXGA @ 60Hz.  In regards to the graphics card question, it is unlikely your graphics card will be substantially stressed unless you are pushing a videogame.  Working in the UI and document editing should be fine.  Reference  <answer88185> From the Tech Specs page over at Apple:  13":     Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, at millions of colors   15":     Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, at millions of colors   <answer122233> Thanks @da4! Apple have updated that page now:  strongHDMI video output/strong  ul liSupport for 1080p resolution at up to 60Hz /li liSupport for 3840-by-2160 resolution at 30Hz /li liSupport for 4096-by-2160 resolution at 24Hz/li /ul  So I can have one external 4k monitor at 30Hz - certainly good enough for programming.  <comment103207> So for the 15" it can effectively support 2x2560x1600 or 8 million additional pixels... I guess I'll have to go with 2 smaller but hi-res monitors... <comment103278> http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go/digital_se/ may also be something to look into if you just need a ton of space.
