getting Red background in Safari <body> I'm getting a strange red background when I visit some pages using Safari.  on Chrome the page is rendered in white normally.  I am not using any extensions and plugins.   How do I fix this bug?  Safari: Version 10.1.1 (12603.2.4)  macOS: Sierra Version 10.12.5  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zvIsx.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongEdit:/strong I do not have the paint flashing feature turned on, I also noticed that this bug occurs on local images with a transparent background without any stylesheets (see image below).   I tried opening a local file image, and it opens normally on Chrome and Preview. However on safari, the images has a red background.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3rjXB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer285623> I think this is a feature for web developers called "paint flashing".  Right-click on a blank bit of a page and select "Inspect Element", this will open the Web Inspector in Safari.  In the top-right corner of the Web Inspector there are a few icons. One looks like a paint brush. On your machine I bet it is selected.  Click it to turn it off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQ5Xr.png" alt="Screenshot of Safari Web Inspector showing Paint Flashing button"  <comment359663> Which macOS version and Safari version are you using? <comment359673> @pjctech Safari: Version 10.1.1 (12603.2.4) macOS: Sierra Version 10.12.5 <comment359675> Ad blocker plus and ghostery are shown in the screen shot. Can you confirm you get red content when you make a new user account in macOS and use straight safari? <comment359686> @bmike yes, I turned off AdBlocker and ghostly (and all the other extensions). same issue. I have updated the screenshot with the extensions removed. <comment359695> Although you've turned off all extensions it'd still be good to test if you get this problem in a fresh user account (as suggested by @bmike ). To do this, go to System Preferences  Users & Groups and add another user. Then log into their account and test Safari. <comment359784> @Monomeeth, and  Bmike you are correct!! signing in the Guest account removed this bug. I tried reseting Safari in my main account (but it is still showing the strange red background) using the following link - https://www.macissues.com/2015/06/22/how-to-fully-reset-safari-on-your-mac/
