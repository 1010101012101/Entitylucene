macOS Sierra: vim doesn't recognise sudo user <body> I recently bought a MacBook Air and upgraded to macOS Sierra.  While editing a file using codevim/code I used codesudo vim php.ini/code  But when I trying to write anything or save it prompts that the file is in readonly mode.  However when I edit the file using codenano/code using codesudo nano php.ini/code the changes are saved without any issue.  When I did a codels -la/code I see a user group called strongwheel/strong.  I changed these entries in code/etc/sudoers/code:  precode%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL %sudo  ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  But didn't work.   Can anyone please help out in this. I'm new to the whole macOS environment.  <comment317635> Which permissions are set for `php.ini`(run `ls -l php.ini` to check)? Did you try to save from `vim` using ESC `w!`? <comment317681> Result of `ls -l php.ini` is `-r--r--r--  1 root  wheel  72286 Sep 29 22:02 php.ini` <comment317688> Saving the file with `w!` works. After which I have to do `:q` Can't I use `wq` directly/. <comment317726> That's how `vim` works, prevents accidentical overwrites of files. `w!q` might work as well (untested). <comment317733> The correct method to manage such a file mode is: `chmod u+w php.ini ; vim php.ini ; chmod u-w php.ini`. The behaviour of `vim` is normal. <comment317804> Ohh, is it? Wasn't aware of it. Coming from an Ubuntu background where I ma used to `:wq` for saving a file. Thanks guys <comment318262> Not a file with mode `444`. You should put this piece of information within your original question so as everyone to avoid thinking this is a `sudo` problem.
