What happens to the music I downloaded from Apple music if I can't make a payment? <body> I've downloaded lots of music from the Apple Music trial, what happens if after say 4 months I stop paying? Does all my music get deleted or do I get to keep it.   <comment321646> Not totally. I am only using the trial as an example, got an answer or just want to complain? <comment321715> It's the same answer â€” "songs are accessible only during your Apple Music membership"
