Random and brief fan spin up <body> I occasionally leave my Mac mini on but with its screens off, the way my power settings is  set.. the Mac should go into sleep mode after 15 minutes of inactivity.  I noticed tonight that this did not happen, and randomly an hour later the Macs fan started to spin up aggressively for a very brief period (5 seconds).  Could anyone tell me what this could be? Or is there a log that I can go through to see what was happening?  strongEDIT/strong (as suggest by @AnonymousAppDev)  precode    23/01/2014 01:30:46 GMT   Assertion status system-wide:    BackgroundTask                 0    PreventDiskIdle                0    ApplePushServiceTask           0    UserIsActive                   1    PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0    InteractivePushServiceTask     0    PreventSystemSleep             1    ExternalMedia                  0    PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     1    NetworkClientActive            0 Listed by owning process:    pid 182(coreaudiod): [0x000000010000178c] 00:00:57 NoIdleSleepAssertion named: "com.apple.audio.'AppleUSBAudioEngine:Bose Corporation:Bose USB Audio:14200000:1'.noidlesleep"     pid 1063(VLC): [0x000000010000178d] 00:00:57 NoIdleSleepAssertion named: "VLC media playback"     pid 72(hidd): [0x0000000a0000178f] 00:00:43 UserIsActive named: "com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle"      Timeout will fire in 557 secs Action=TimeoutActionRelease    pid 1264(screensharingd): [0x000000080000175c] 00:02:50 PreventSystemSleep named: "Remote user is connected"  Kernel Assertions: 0x10c=USB,BT-HID,MAGICWAKE    id=500  level=255 0x4=USB mod=22/01/2014 20:59 description=XHC1 owner=AppleUSBXHCI    id=502  level=255 0x4=USB mod=22/01/2014 20:54 description=EHC1 owner=AppleUSBEHCI    id=504  level=255 0x8=BT-HID mod=01/01/1970 01:00 description=com.apple.driver.IOBluetoothHIDDriver owner=BNBMouseDevice    id=505  level=255 0x100=MAGICWAKE mod=23/01/2014 01:41 description=en0 owner=en0 /code/pre  I suspect it has something to di with either VLC or my USB Speakers?  <answer118349> First of all, we need to see if something is preventing your Mac from sleeping.  ol liOpen Terminal.app/li liType in pmset -g assertions/li /ol  What you are looking for is these lines:     PreventUserIdleDisplaySleepbr      PreventSystemSleepbr      PreventUserIdleSystemSleepbr      InternalPreventDisplaySleep    and      Listed by owning process:     pid xx(nameofdaemon): [0x000000090000012c] 01:45:46 BlahBlah named: "com.randomnam"    Copy and paste all of that into your question.  Next, try resetting the SMC (System Management Controller)  Taken from Apple Support  ol liShut down the computer./li liUnplug the computer's power cord./li liWait fifteen seconds./li liAttach the computer's power cord./li liWait five seconds, then press the power button to turn on the computer./li /ol  Finally, check the Console Logs  ol liOpen Console.app/li liClick in the search box and type in sleep/li liFind the entries that match the time your Mac was sleeping/li liCopy and paste it in your answer/li /ol  The first and third fixes weren't really fixes. I just hope that the data you paste will help find the cause.  <comment138116> @AnontniysAppDev Thank you, I did not know such a command existed, I have updated the question with the log. <comment138120> Try uninstalling VLC Player, disconnecting your speakers, and disabling screen sharing. If that works, slowly re-enable/reinstall/reconnect everything one-by-one
