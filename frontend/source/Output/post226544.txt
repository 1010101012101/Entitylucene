How to set proxy on OS X Terminal permanently? <body> For every new session in OS X terminal, I have to make my proxy settings again.  I do this by entering the command  precodeexport http_proxy="username:password@ip address:port number" /code/pre  Is there a way to make these proxy settings once for all?  <answer226547> I'm assuming you mean aliases, not proxys.  Add it to ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile. See this guide for more depth. I don't believe OS X supports a ~/.bash_aliases file.  <answer227300> Your http proxy (just for some web sites not https ones and not for the rest of the internet) can be set for each terminal session by adding the line  precodeexport http_proxy="username:password@ip address:port number" /code/pre  to your ~/.bash_profile file  Note this will only affect command line programs.  <comment275170> What proxy settings? What commands do you use? <comment275171> No bash directly supports ~/.bash_aliases you call it from ~/.bashrc (which you probably should call from ~..bash_profile as well) <comment275175> @Mark Fair, but (to my limited knowledge) some systems do so automagically which makes it easy. <comment276049> with regard to internet.                                                                                       export http_proxy="username:password@ip address:port number"
