How can I use turn on/off application in AppleScript? <body> Can I use to turn on/off application by 'keyboard' in AppleScript?  I make simple macro program, for example auto mouse click or keyboard.  But if idle start, I can't pause or stop it. So I need shortcut key likely "P" or "ESC" for pausing.   My script is:  precodeon idle  display dialog ~  //I want if I press "S" key, (Start).  //I want if I press "P" key, (Pause).  //I want if I press "Q" key, (tell to me quit)  end idle /code/pre  Is it possible to get key from pressed key?
