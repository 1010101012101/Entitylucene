Is there a `watch` command native to Darwin/OS X? <body> I have a script that I'm trying to port from Linux to Darwin/OS X. The Linux version currently depends on the codewatch/code command, which doesn't appear to be installed on Darwin/OS X by default. What's the native alternative?  <answer233939> There is no native alternative. You must acquire codewatch/code from using Homebrew (codebrew install watch/code) or MacPorts (codeport install watch/code) if you require an actual executable.  You can however, emulate the function of codewatch/code. That can be accomplished in a standard bash while loop (from Stack Overflow by Daniel Pittman):     You can emulate the basic functionality with the shell loop:  precodewhile :; do clear; your_command; sleep 2; done /code/pre      That will loop forever, clear the screen, run your command, and wait two seconds - the basic watch your_command implementation.      You can take this a step further and create a watch.sh script that can   accept your_command and sleep_duration as parameters:  precode#!/bin/bash # usage: watch.sh &lt;your_command&gt; &lt;sleep_duration&gt;  while :;   do   clear   date   $1   sleep   $2 done /code/pre   That, and other options, are available on Stack Overflow.
