Option-Delete deletes word with white space in front <body> So this has been driving me crazy for a while now: when you have a lot of blank space before a word, you go to the beginning of the line and push option-delete, it will delete not only the blank space, but also the next word. All editors in Windows and Linux will only delete the blank space. Is there a setting for this? This is an absolute must-have for me when, for example, trying to format code in XCode. As an example:  precodeThis is line 1 (caret-&gt;) |             this should not get deleted /code/pre  Pushing option-delete, I expect this:  precodeThis is line 1 (caret-&gt;) |this should not get deleted /code/pre  But instead, I get this:  precodeThis is line 1 (caret-&gt;) |should not get deleted /code/pre  This is particularly nasty when you copy-paste code from somewhere, and get something like this:  precodeUIImageView *imgView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:                                               CGRectMake(0,0,100,100)]; /code/pre  ....and you want to quickly consolidate into one line.  Does anyone have a fix for this?  <answer14377> I select the entire space and word as per your example. Then keeping kbdShift/kbd and kbdOption/kbd pressed, I use the left arrow to select the empty space. Works like a charm and is only one extra keypress.  <comment15482> I think this behaviour is by design. I've just learned to work around it. <comment15486> So how do you work around it?
