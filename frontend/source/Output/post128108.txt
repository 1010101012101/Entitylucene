Signature image not appearing in sent email <body> If I create a signature with mac mail and attach a png file to the signature, when I send the email the image appears as a black box on the sent email (examples attached).  In mac mail itself the image appears correctly.  How can I get the image to be sent correctly?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRCAp.png" alt="Example received image 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lGael.png" alt="Example received image 2"  <answer128137> This is the right (and best) way to create an HTML signature that includes images: http://matt.coneybeare.me/how-to-make-and-html-signature-in-apple-mail/
