Can OS X play AMR files? <body> I have an AMR-format audio file which I recorded with my HTC Desire. I would like to send it to somebody who has a Macbook Pro. Will he be able to play it without jumping through hoops?  <answer15803> QuickTime Player claims to open AMR files.  I don't have any AMR files to test it, though.  <answer15804> I'm sure, VLC will play them.   <comment17215> I can confirm that QuickTime X can play AMR files. I just downloaded one and tested it.
