Login screen shows "Guest" option even though it is disabled <body> I have disabled the "Guest" option on my Macbook Pro, however it still shows the "Guest" bubble next to my account on the login screen.  <answer227444> A possible way to remove the Guest account is to disable Find My Mac in iCloud settings.   Check this out: Disable guest account  <answer228224> I had the same problem as you. I solve it by reenable and disable it again, but in the last step I also change the option in strongLogin Option/strong on strongDisplay login windows as:/strong from strongList of users/strong to strongName and password/strong. I guess the trigger is enable and disable it again. It might be a problem from the El Capitan. I hope this help.  <comment276027> What OS X version? <comment276037> Have you modified the `Directory Utility` configurations at all? <comment276092> @slick OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 <comment276093> @njboot Haven't touched it <comment276094> Is Find my Mac switched on? That sets the Guest account up as a honey-trap. <comment276222> I have already done that and "Guest" is still there on logon. <comment276223> @Tetsujin It's been turned off <comment278266> Tried that. Didn't work.
