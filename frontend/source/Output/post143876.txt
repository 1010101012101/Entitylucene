The fans in my MacBook Pro (2007) run at full speed for no reason? <body> For some reason the fans in my MacBook Pro em(2007 model)/em seem to run at full speed for no apparent reason, I've been using the "iStats" gem to monitor my temps and fan speeds - what's strange is that the CPU temperature often sits around em40 - 45Â°C/em even when the fans are running around the em2000RPM/em mark - yet occasionally, for some odd reason it decides to boost them up to em5000RPM+/em. I'll just be happily browsing the web and all of a sudden it decides its time for takeoff...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vHtN3.png" alt="CPU Temp &amp; Fan Speed, iStats Terminal View"  Anybody know a reason or possible fix for this? I've considered using some software to control the fan speed manually though I don't want to do anything that might potentially cause the system overheat.  Any ideas are welcome!  <answer143880> Trouble with fan speeds can almost always be solved by resetting the System Management Controller, or SMC.     After performing normal troubleshooting, these symptoms may indicate that an SMC reset could be necessary.      strongFans/strong      ul   liThe computer's fans run at high speed although the computer is not experiencing heavy usage and is properly ventilated./li   /ul   supSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964/sup  The procedure for laptops with removable batteries is as follows:     ol   liShut down the computer./li   liDisconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the computer, if it's connected./li   liRemove the battery./li   liPress and hold the power button for 5 seconds./li   liRelease the power button./li   liReconnect the battery and MagSafe power adapter./li   liPress the power button to turn on the computer./li   /ol   supSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964/sup  <comment169483> Thanks for this, I'll give it a shot and see if it works! <comment169543> UPDATE : Fans seem to be working normally, I'll give it a little while to see how things go - fingers crossed that this worked! <comment169562> UPDATE 2 : Fans seem to be much quieter and certainly slower. - Thanks for this!
