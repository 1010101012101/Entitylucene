How to make right click using keyboard? <body> Is there any strongkeyboard short-cut or key/strong for Mac to make mouse right click? It feels me very frustrating to touch the mouse every time to view options. Is there any way like strongemwindows option key/em/strong?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uRuVk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Added image for more details.  <answer119704> For difficulties using the mouse, you can turn on Mouse Keys: Located in System Preferences  Universal Access  Mouse tab.  As it states "Use the Keyboard in place of the mouse". Also several options are available to choose from that may meet your needs.  Apple's support notes for each OSX version have more information:  ul liOS X Mountain Lion: Control the pointer using Mouse Keys/li liOS X Mavericks: Control the pointer using Mouse Keys/li liOS X El Capitan: Control the pointer using Mouse Keys/li liOS X Yosemite: Control the pointer using Mouse Keys/li /ul  <answer119761> I don't know any way to show a context menu for items selected with the keyboard like what the menu key does in Windows.  To assign a keyboard shortcut for performing a secondary click at the current coordinates of the pointer, you can either:  ul liUse a private.xml like this with Karabiner:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Right Mousebutton&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;rightMouseButton&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, PointingButton::RIGHT&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liUse BetterTouchTool:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dcpu0.png" alt=""/li liUse Keyboard Maestro:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6yVJ.png" alt=""/li liDownload MouseTools and assign a shortcut to codeMouseTools -rightClick/code./li /ul  <answer217237> There is some builtin feature you can access by System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Keyboard (sorry I have the german OS X installed so this is my rough translation).  There you can find a keyboard shortcut called "Focus to menubar" (my shortcut is set to kbdCTRL/kbd-kbdF2/kbd.  Activate it, select the file and hit the shortcut keys, then you get the keyboard focus on your menubar. Navigate with the cursor keys to the "Services" menu, select the service and hit kbdEnter/kbd.   Voila, the service is executed on the selected file  <answer258569> This is a native method requiring no extra apps, plugins, or extensions using mouse keys.  There are strongtwo ways to enable mouse keys/strong, so if you can't find it in the first method, use the second method.  strongFirst Method:/strong  Go to System Preferences  Accessibility, find Mouse &amp; Trackpad, then enable "Mouse Keys".  If you want go to the options menu and enable "Press the Option key five times to toggle Mouse Keys"(to quickly change between mouse keys on or mouse keys off). Sometimes, you might want to turn Mouse Keys off as with Mouse Keys on, some keys on your keyboard won't work(mostly it should be fine). If you look around some more there should be a way to fix this and leave mouse keys on permanently. Here is an image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BR12Q.png" alt="Enable Mouse Keys"  strongSecond Method:/strong  Press Option-Command-F5, and a window will pop up. Select "Mouse Keys". That's it! Sometimes, you might want to turn Mouse Keys off as with Mouse Keys on, some keys on your keyboard won't work(mostly it should be fine).

If you agree using an external keyboard, just find the equivalent to the function key.

It's a bit slower than a real mouse (~0.5 second delay), but it works and requires no third-party software.  hr  Open Automator and create a new service:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GjsR8.png" alt="Automator service menu"  hr  Choose strongService receives codeno input/code in codeany application/code ./strong  Search for "shell" and drag the "Run Shell Script" action to the storyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pf3Mm.png" alt="Storyboard"  hr  Paste the following code into the emRun Shell Script/em action:  precodefrom Quartz.CoreGraphics import CGEventCreateMouseEvent, kCGMouseButtonRight, CGEventPost, kCGHIDEventTap, CGEventCreate, kCGEventRightMouseDown, kCGEventRightMouseUp, CGEventGetLocation  def mouseEvent(type, posx, posy):           theEvent = CGEventCreateMouseEvent(None, type, (posx,posy), kCGMouseButtonRight)           CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, theEvent)  event = CGEventCreate(None) position = CGEventGetLocation(event) mouseEvent(kCGEventRightMouseDown, int(position.x), int(position.y)) mouseEvent(kCGEventRightMouseUp, int(position.x), int(position.y)) /code/pre  hr  Save the service (cmd+s). Use a descriptive name like "Perform a right-click".  hr  Go to codeSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xmm35.png" alt="The services menu"  Look for your service (it should be near the bottom of the list) and assign a keyboard shortcut.  You should now be able to use your shortcut to perform a right-click.  <answer259668> Install Karabiner. If you are running MacOS 10.8, you will have to choose codeKeyRemap4MacBook-8.4.0/code (accessible from the main page).  Disclaimer:     Since I am testing it on Yosemite, I will give you screen capture and   results which are tested on this version of MacOS. This answer might   not work on Lion (if this is the case, signal it ASAP).   Open Karabiner preferences from the Menu bar drop down menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mvDDk.png" alt="Karabiner Preferences..."  Scroll down to the settings group for codeChange Option_R Key/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BABhJ.png" alt="Karabiner Change Option_R Key"  and open it.  Scroll down to the predefined setting to map Option_R key to a right click: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nu7vq.png" alt="Karabiner Option_R to RightClick"  Activate it and close the Karabiner preferences window.  Check it, and confirm if it fails or works.  <comment139632> I can't find. my os ver is 10.8.5, which is yours? <comment139691> The Universal Access preference pane has been called Accessibility since 10.8. <comment139811> @Nixx: I am able to use keyboard for navigation of mouse pointer only. However `option` key is not working and thats my requirement <comment276063> There is no point in do it at current mouse coordinates.. it should be a current selection.. is possible? <comment305526> So what's wrong with user495470's answer, preetam and @melchior? you probably won't get any more answers until you state more specifically what you don't like about that one. <comment305555> expecting something native, quick setting and not lot of preconfig or installing some other tool. <comment320387> This is ridiculously annoying ; can't right clic without removing my hands from the keyboard. And apparently it's the only way to access the context menu on selection, its to move your mouse there... <comment320618> @ArnoldRoa Agreed. Any way to do this at the current selection or cursor position not the mouse location? <comment322088> A right click is achieved by pressing down on the trackpad with two fingers. Or pressing <comment322101> Did you try Control-Click? <comment322118> its kind of using track pad <comment323303> it may select/activate, but its not making "right click". <comment323304> couldn't find this option, using macbook, without mouse <comment323333> It works! but its useless, cause I must have mac's Fn key around to do it. and if I have it around, it means I'm working on the actual laptop, meaning I would probably use the trackpad. it's for the times where I'm using external keyboard that this functionality becomes handy. only that I couldn't find a way to map my Windows-Option key on my HP keyboard, to the Fn key. <comment323362> @preetam - What version are you using? <comment323365> @kumetix I've added to my answer to suit your problem. <comment323373> Without a number keypad, the "some keys" that won't work under Mousekeys are 7, 8, 9, U, O, J, K, L, which could be a problem... <comment323468> @TomGewecke I know, that's why I showed how to quickly activate and deactivate mouse keys/ <comment323469> @preetam - I've added more to my answer to suit your problem. <comment323498> @books453: enabling mouse key is really weird, have you tried working after enabling? btw, its giving `right click on mouse position`, that should not be the case. <comment323679> @preetam you commented on my answer saying "@books453: enabling mouse key is really weird, have you tried working after enabling? btw, its giving right click on mouse position, that should not be the case." What do you mean by this? What should be the case here? <comment324744> Could you clarify the function you want to get and that you describe as "windows option key" for people who never used a Windows and might help? <comment324887> @danielAzuelos: added image for more details. <comment324889> Is it behaving as a right click or [ctl]+[click] from a trackpad or a mouse? <comment324890> I'm looking for `keyboard short-cut or key` thats what I written in original question <comment324891> You might have noticed that most of the reply don't answer correctly to your question. This is because your specification is lacking a key detail: the specification of the behaviour you are expecting. <comment324894> Is what you are looking for the behaviour of a right click on a Mac? If not, then please specify clearly. <comment347061> I see what you mean. The challenge for lifelong mac users is knowing how to answer this question without more info about your end goal. One of the things I loved when I *was* using Windows was that nearly everything had a keyboard shortcut or a way to use the keyboard to execute an action. What is the command you are trying to execute with the right-click? <comment357241> So frustrating that there is no solution for this issue: right click on currently selected item (not mouse pointer) like how Windows' [Shift]-[f10] <comment360742> The problem with this solution is that the click happens exactly where the mouse is. So if you are scrolling items with the arrow keys (like the desktop icons say) and then use the shortcut the popup will not show the icon properties but the properties of the item your mouse is currently on... <comment371714> @danielAzuelos  The specification from the OP is clear: *do not include the mouse/trackpad in any answer* on how to achieve the right click. <comment371715> This does not meet the OP requirements of "not installing 3rd party tools". *However* .. `karabiner` is almost an extension of mac imho: it's *far* more prevalent and useful than *any* other mac keyboard software. So I am going to upvote. <comment371765> @javadba: I share your analysis. I used Karabiner on 4 diferrent versions of MacOS X, it's free, and I would enjoy the 1st commercial product with such a quality.
