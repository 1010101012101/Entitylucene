How to add a shortcut to open a new finder window to the Launchpad or dock <body> What I want: A one-click action in the dock or launchpad that opens the downloads folder in a new finder window.   Note: the Downloads "fan" thing that is in the left side area of the dock is not what I want. When I click that it opens a weird list / grid / fan thing of the stuff in my downloads folder, and then I have to click some more to actually open a finder window. Nope. I want a one click icon in the dock or launchpad.   Additionally: the icon needs to be the Downloads folder icon, if at all possible.   <answer290496> Copy this script to a new ScriptEditor document.  Then export it as an application.    precodetell application "Finder"     activate     make new Finder window to path to downloads folder end tell /code/pre  Next, Open the “Get Info” window for the “Downloads” folder and also open the “Get Info” window for the new application you just exported. Select the icon of the downloads folder and “Edit/Copy” Select the icon of the new application and “”Edit/Paste”.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rO3ai.gif" alt="enter image description here"  Drag your new application down to your dock and you are good to go.  <answer290500> Another way to get what you're asking for, also done as an AppleScript application, but being able to customize the properties of the window.  In Script Editor, create a new document and add the following AppleScript emcode/em as an example:  precodeset theTarget to (path to downloads folder as string) tell application "Finder"     set theWindow to make new Finder window to folder theTarget     tell theWindow to set {current view, toolbar visible, bounds} to {list view, true, {0, 23, 1024, 512}}     activate end tell /code/pre  You can modify the properties to your liking in the codetell theWindow to set/code line of emcode/em  to whatever you'd like of the available properties.  To get the properties, you can open a Finder window to your downloads folder, arrange it how you'd like to appear every time and then use the following in a separate AppleScript document to get it's properties to use in the app that opens it:  precodetell application "Finder" to get properties of windows "Downloads" /code/pre  The above command returns the following example output:     {class:Finder window, id:1004, name:"Downloads", position:{0, 23},   bounds:{0, 23, 1024, 512}, index:1, zoomed:false, closeable:true,   titled:true, floating:false, modal:false, resizable:true,   zoomable:true, visible:true, collapsed:false, target:folder   "Downloads" of folder "me" of folder "Users" of startup disk of   application "Finder", current view:list view, icon view options:icon   view options of Finder window id 1004 of application "Finder", list   view options:list view options of Finder window id 1004 of application   "Finder", column view options:column view options of Finder window id   1004 of application "Finder", toolbar visible:true, statusbar   visible:true, sidebar width:213}   Doing it this way, you get a new Finder window opened to your Downloads folder set exactly how you want it, based on available properties.  See wch1zpink's answer for assigning the Downloads folder icon to the AppleScript application's icon.  <comment366809> Sweet, thanks, this works great. I can even drag the app to the launchpad icon in the dock and it creates a shortcut on the launchpad screen. Exactly what I wanted. <comment366811> Great tip about the icons, I had no idea it worked like that haha
