On an AD joined macOS, the home folder stops auto mounting when switching to mobile accounts <body> We have one AD integrated iMac in our company that is used by a couple of users.  Our AD user accounts have set the following attributes:  ul licodehomeDirectory/code = code\\ad.example.com\Shares\UserHomeFolders$\%username%/code/li /ul  In the Directory Utility (example screenshot for reference) we set the following options.  precode[ ] Create mobile account at login [x] Force local gome directory on startup disk [x] Use UNC path from Active Directory to derive network home location /code/pre  So when any of the users log on to the iMac, the codehomeDirectory/code path is automatically mounted and visible in the bottom bar (can't remember name, please edit if you know it) represented by a globe icon.  So far so good.  We have two issues with that approach:  ol liThe logon screen need about 20-40 seconds to eventually show the "Otherâ€¦" login option./li liThe logon as an AD user only works, when there is a connection to the AD server./li /ol  So we decided to migrate our users to mobile accounts. That is where the problem arises.  After moving a user to a mobile account, the codehomeDirectory/code isn't mounted anymore. In fact, running codemount/code in the terminal doesn't show any network share being mounted anywhere.  So my question is: Why does my mobile account not mount the codehomeDirectory/code when a network account does?
