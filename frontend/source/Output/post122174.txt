Can't find Skype photos captured on Skype on my MacBook Air <body> I have OS X 10.9.1. I captured a photo using Skype (skype 6.12) and I cannot find the folder holding my images.  I've tried looking for the answer on this website but couldn't find it.  <answer122215> OK, I did the search and found it in most peculiar place one can think of.  This is on my MBA with 10.9.2.  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ImageKit.RecentPictureService/Data/Library/Images/Recent Pictures /code/pre  You will find two types of image files there -- TIFF (thumbnail) and standard code.png/code  The code.tiff/code are converted by Skype to a profile pictures, the code.png/code are the originals.
