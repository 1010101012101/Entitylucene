Remote dual boot, how to select OS to boot <body> I'm installing Bootcamp ( Win7 64bit if that matters ) on my Mac Mini, since you need to pick the OS to start up while booting, how can I do this remotely?  Example:  VNC into OSX, reboot the machine, how do I select either OSX or Windows? Is there an option I can pass in while rebooting?  <answer104987> You can use BootChamp to quickly restart in Windows from OS X. To restart in OS X from Windows see OS X Lion - Start up using Mac OS X or Windows:     h3Restart directly in Mac OS X from Windows:/h3      Click the Boot Camp icon in the system tray and choose “Restart in Mac OS X.”   hr  A more tedious way is to set the startup disk to the other OS every time and then restart. From the OS X Lion - Start up using Mac OS X or Windows page linked above:     h3Set the default operating system:/h3      ol   liDo one of the following:      ul   liIn Mac OS X, choose Apple  System Preferences and click Startup Disk./li   liIn Windows, choose Boot Camp Control Panel from the Boot Camp system tray item./li   /ul/li   liSelect the startup disk with the operating system you want to use by default./li   liIf you want to start up that operating system now, click Restart./li   /ol   The Apple support page for OS X Mountain Lion - Start up using Mac OS X or Windows contains the same instructions for OS X Mountain Lion.
