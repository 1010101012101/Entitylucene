OSX Sierra Network Drive issues <body> Since upgrading to Sierra, I'm seeing a couple weird behaviors:  ul liOn startup, when I try to mount the remote network drive, the login window pops up with login credentials already filled in and I have to click OK. This didn't happen before./li liWhen browsing drives through the finder or through an application window, I'm getting temporarily 'locked out' of folders. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to regain access, sometimes it take many minutes. It's like the folder is indexing or something. Never seen this before./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLGVA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment317722> The first one has been widely-reported and I would imagine it's intentional, probably to make sure that users are aware volumes are being mounted.
