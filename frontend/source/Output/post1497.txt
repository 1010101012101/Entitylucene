Growl Notifications for Stack Exchange websites? <body> I'm looking for a way to get Growl notifications for new questions on the Stack Exchange websites, matching some pre-defined tags.  I've tried SENotify, but it didn't work for me. Any alternative?  <answer1509> RSS Growler + feeds?  <answer1510> I get Stack Exchange Growl notifications using Adium + Stackguru.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V9jLf.png" alt="alt text"  <answer26852> Have a look to Newt on StackApps, I'm currently using it and it's a pretty neat and solid app.  <comment1355> I tried that. Works perfectly with other feeds, not with the ones from Stack Overflow. <comment1356> Thanks for this. Apparently they've just fixed SENotify - which now works for me -, but I've also tried yours and it works like a charme.
