OS X security version? <body> I am trying to find out the most recent security patch that has been installed on a system (e.g. 2015-006). In this case, it is the latest Yosemite (10.10.5). Neither the version nor the build number are helpful here, as security patches do not seem to update them.  <answer230820> All security updates are recorded in receipts folder located here:  precodels -ltr /var/db/receipts /code/pre  If you list the receipts folder, you can see the most recent updates installed.  <comment281836> At least on Yosemite, /var/db/receipts is a folder. Still didn't find the security patch though, which might mean it is unpatched 10.10.5. <comment281840> @stands2reason, Yeah it should read ls -ltr, vice tail. Working late... <comment281853> I tested installing the 2016-001 update, and sure enough it's there now. Don't forget to pipe it into `grep com.apple.pkg.update.security` to filter results.
