You have to edit:  precode/Library/Server/Web/Config/Proxy/apache_serviceproxy.conf /code/pre  and   precode/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/services/ACSServer.conf /code/pre  Change "Listen ..." to "# Listen ..." (Change to comment).br This prevents the httpd from starting.  You have to restart after this!   <comment273502> You have to restart after this! <comment303186> You can skip the restart if you do a: sudo killall httpd Also, I took a look in the ACSServer.conf file and I didn't see any mention of port 80 or 443 in it <comment305098> Also didn't find any "listen" in `/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/services/ACSServer.conf`. I just commented out listening on port 80 and 443 in `/Library/Server/Web/Config/Proxy/apache_serviceproxy.conf`, then ran `sudo killall httpd` to kill those processes and it worked fine.
