How do I set the cover photo of a "shared" Photos album? <body> I understand how to set the cover ("key") photo of an Apple Photos album, but I can't see how to change the cover photo of a "shared" (copied) album.  How do I set the cover photo of a "shared" Photos album?  <answer269540> You can't.  With shared iCloud photo albums the key photo will always be the photo that was uploaded last.  <comment338576> That's what I feared. <comment338578> You don't have to stop here, though. **Please send Apple your feedback**. See this answer to see how I sent feedback in the past. I think your requested feature is worth adding and I have wondered how to this, too. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/252679/music-ratings-on-ios-10/253384#253384
