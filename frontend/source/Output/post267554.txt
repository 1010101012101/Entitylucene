Wake up MacBook Pro remotely without a device from the AirPort family? <body> I have some files on my MacBook Pro that I sometimes want to be able to access from work. I have done it a few times and it worked perfectly using screensharing, but that is when my wife was at home to wake up the laptop for me.   I've read in other forums that I could wake it up using AirPort Extreme, AirPort Express, Apple TV or Time Capsule, but I do bot have the money or use for them except for this particular reason. Does anyone know if I can do this any other way? Google also does not give a whole lot of useful info on this.  Thanks!  <comment335748> Don't let your mac sleep.. in Energy settings you can specifiy it should stay on <comment335802> I don't know if I want it on all day without going to sleep at all but yes that would be a pretty easy way to do it â€“ thank you
