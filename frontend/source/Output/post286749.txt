How to add a user from the command line in macOS? <body> In Terminal, I used, codeuseradd liao2/code, as I would also do in Linux, but it failed:  precodeuseradd liao2 -bash useradd: command not found /code/pre  I also tried using codesudo/code:  precodesudo useradd liao2 Password: sudo: useradd: command not found /code/pre  strongHow can a user be added from Terminal?/strong  <answer286750> Mac OS doesn't have the same unix commands as Linux. To add a user, properly use the system preferences pane for Users &amp; Groups to add a user.   System Preferences will have a Users &amp; Groups section. There you can click the + icon in the bottom left to add a user as standard or administrator.   OS X uses a directory service to administrate users. The adduser command equivalent for Mac is      dscl . -create /User/$username_here   Followed by a long chain of commands to set up that user properly. Please see the manual page for more detailed information.   <answer286829> A similar tool to codeuseradd/code is code/usr/sbin/sysadminctl/code on macOS . There isn't a manual but code/usr/sbin/sysadminctl -h/code is explanatory. You should be aware that the command and options will be stored in your shell's history. Note the last line of the help output so that the user password is not stored in your shell's history.  <comment361909> surely it doesn't mean that there is a command for adding user? <comment363020> sudo sysadminctl -addUser username
