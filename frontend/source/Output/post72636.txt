How to get list of played pdocasts in Itunes so that I select which to delete? <body> In iTunes, I want to be able to pull up a list of played podcasts from time to time and select some for deletion.  I don't want to auto-delete podcasts marked as played as a) I share the library with my wife and don't want podcasts to disappear if only one of us has listened to them and b) I want to be able to keep some favourites.  I can get the list of played podcasts by setting up a smart playlist of media kind=podcast, but I can't delete them using that list because it is just a playlist.  I can see what I want to delete, but I then have to go back the podcast view and find and delete each one individually, which seems clumsy.  Any ideas?  Billy  <answer72638> Create a smart playlist with the criteria “Media kind is Podcast” and ”Plays is larger than 0”.

If I delete an entry from a playlist it doesn't delete the podcast, which is what I am trying to do. <comment85703> Did you try ⌘⌫ (command backspace) to delete files?
