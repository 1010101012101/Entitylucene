Tabs to spaces in BBEdit <body> How can I configure BBEdit to insert 4 spaces (or at least spaces up to the next column which is a multiple of 4)? I've checked "Auto-expand tabs" in the preferences, but it doesn't seem to be doing that.  <answer14363> The Auto-expand tabs preference must also be set for the Language mapping setting. Also, the setting won't be applied until you create or open a new document.  See codeLanguages/code in BBEdit.  <comment15462> Ah, I needed to create/open a document, that was it. Thanks! <comment147561> Why would you want spaces rather than tabs?
