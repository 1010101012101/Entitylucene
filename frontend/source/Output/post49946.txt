launchd: ask user before performing tasks <body> Is there a way to get a user-defined launchd task (i.e. like the one in this question) to get user confirmation before executing the task? A popup like the one for scheduled sleep (with yes/no and a timer in case of no user input) would be great, otherwise a simple yes/no popup would work.   <answer99550> Make launchd call this AppleScript. It displays a dialog with a timeout and calls a shell script if the user selected "Ok".  precodeset timeoutInSeconds to 60 set abortOnTimeout to true  tell application (path to frontmost application as text)     try         set dialogResult to display dialog "Do you want to execute?" default button 2 giving up after timeoutInSeconds         on error number -128             return     end try end tell  if gave up of dialogResult and abortOnTimeout then     return end if  do shell script "/path/to/yourscript.sh" /code/pre  <answer99577> Launchd agents emare/em allowed to interact with the GUI, and even daemons can use osascript to display dialogs.  You could also use something like this in a shell script:  precodeosascript -e 'tell app (path to frontmost application as text)' display dialog "Continue?" end' || exit 0 /code/pre  The script exits with an error if the user presses the cancel button or closes the dialog. You could also tell a background process like SystemUIServer to display the dialog, but you'd have to add something like codeactivate application (path to frontmost application as text)/code to move focus back to the previously focused window.
