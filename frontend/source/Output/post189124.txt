Reboot loop after the "effective power" message <body> If you are not known about this phemomenon, sending this message to someone with iOS will cause the phone to reboot strongonce/strong.   However, this time the phone strongdoesn't stop rebooting/strong. After the reboot is finished, it starts with a new reboot. Basically I'm stuck.   Is there anything I can do to make this loop stop?  Thanks a lot in advance
