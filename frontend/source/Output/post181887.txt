How do disable control by iPhone headphones? <body> I have bought 2 iPhone headphones from Amazon, good quality earphones with 5-star reviews, but unfortunately there seem an issue where it randomly initiates commands.   Music forwards, music rewards, Siri asks me if I have a question, all features that would be normally initiated by pressing your headphone buttons.   So the headphone mostly make listening music on the iPhone impossible, because of all the random control features being initiated.  How can I disable these headphone controls? The quality of the audio is pretty good and I'd like to keep using these headphones.  <answer181890> You can't disable controls...you can just return headphones to Amazon  <answer181973> This is trivially accomplished by removing the third pin from the connectivity. You could buy an adapter for this purpose if you don't want to change headsets or get what appears to be a faulty switch in it repaired.  ul lihttp://www.amazon.com/EZOPower-Headset-Adapter-Smartphone-smartphone/dp/B0046FMRGA//li /ul  Basically the green plug goes into your phone and the headphones go to the black end of the cable.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ehCES.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer194820> I had the exact same problem, but I fixed it by plugging in a different pair, to confuse your phone, then switch back. Just borrow a friend's headphones for a sec to do that. Hope it works for you. I just found this out on accident a few minutes ago.  <answer228373> I have a similar problem, I use an aux extension cable. It disables all input from the headphone buttons. The one is have is really long, so it's a little inconvenient, but I'm sure you can find a short one.   <comment216502> There are lots of ways to bypass a flakey switch. I agree returning defective merch is good in general, but it doesn't explain how things work since not all people with this issue will be in a return window or find it economical to get headphones repaired. <comment216515> He can't disable controls by software, he should disable third pin buying another accessory wich means more expenses and more things in the pocket...is non-sense considering that defective products are replaced for free from Amazon...
