Can 2013 retina MacBook Pro (Mavericks) offer same native 1600x1200 via VGA display that worked with 2009 MBP (pre-Mavericks)? <body> I have a Samsung 213T LCD, with a native resolution of 1600x1200, that worked great as an external monitor, using a DisplayPort VGA adapter, with my 2009 13" MacBook Pro through several OSX releases.   I recently upgraded to a 2013 15" rMBP with Mavericks... and it can't properly detect the monitor, and never shows 1600x1200 as a resolution option.   Things I've tried that haven't helped:  ul lithe 'detect displays' button that appears when holding [option] in 'system-preferences' - 'display'/li liholding [option] when choosing the 'scaled' radio button (it shows more resolution options - but still not the 1600x1200 native)/li liresetting PRAM/NVRAM/li liboth off-brand (monoprice) and Apple VGA DisplayPort adapters/li lichanging the built-in retina display resolution (to perhaps free video memory) /li lithe free 'Display Menu' app in the Mac App Store/li /ul  None have helped.   I wasn't expecting a regression in the ability to drive modest external monitors in the 2015 MBP/Mavericks.   Is there any way to restore this previously-reliable external-display function to my latest &amp; greatest Mac?    <comment144285> Since you've already tried two VGA adapters, have you thought about giving a thunderbolt to DVI adapter a try? Looks like they aren't extremely expensive on Amazon. <comment144291> I'll surely get there, or a HDMI-DVI cord... but this feels like a software glitch with a software fix, just convincing the MBP to output a 1600x1200 signal.
