Qt Creator for Mac <body> My Uni course requires me to use Qt Creator for our coursework but I would like to also put it on my Mac so that I can do more work at home. I had assumed it was available for free but when I tried to download it, I was told to register for a 30-day trial, which I took to mean that the software isn't free.  Can I get Qt Creator for Mac for free and where from?  <answer66120> You have to go to the Qt open-source site:br http://qt-project.org/downloads     The Qt SDK version 1.2.1 released on April 11th contains:         ul   liQt libraries version 4.8.1   /li   liSimulator for Symbian phones and the Nokia N9  /li   listrongQt Creator IDE version 2.4.1/strong  /li   liQt Mobility version 1.2  /li   liQt development tools  /li   liRemote compilers /li   /ul   The Qt SDK includes Qt Creator.  hr  Note that the installer is strong760 MB/strong.   <comment77802> Thank you. I am also a little unsure about the usage of Qt: can I make GUI apps for any platform? I seem to be seeing Nokia a lot when I search for Qt, what has Nokia got to do with it? <comment77881> @Sam - The idea behind Qt is you can generally compile your app for any platform. Realistically, you generally have to do a bit of tweaking for each platform, but it does make it easier then writing native apps for every platform. <comment77882> You're seeing nokia because nokia owns the Qt trademarks, and is largely the driving force behind it's development.
