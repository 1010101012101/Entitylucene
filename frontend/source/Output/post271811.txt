Magic Trackpad 2 as a MIDI controler <body> I want to make music with a MagicTrackpad2, keeping it away from interacting with the mouse pointer.  I found this software: MultiTouchMidi that works great with the builtin trackpad of a macbook.    At first, the pointer of the mouse was moving while I was playing music. This could be solved with an external mouse, and checking the box "Ignore Trackpad when Mouse is plugged in" under Universal Access.  Now, I would like this: MagicTrackpad2 plays MIDI and does not affect the mouse, and the builtin trackpad controls just the mouse.  How can I achieve this ?
