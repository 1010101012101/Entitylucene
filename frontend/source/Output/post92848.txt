Google Calendar periodically refusing to sync with Calendar on OS X 10.8 <body> I use Calendar on OS X 10.8 and link my google calendars to it. Periodically (and I can't detect a pattern) the calendar stops syncing with Google, with an error message of the form     https://calendar.google.com/calendar/dav/MyID@gmail.com/user/ is not a   location that supports this request.   In the past I've had to reset my google app-specific password ( I use two-factor authentication) to fix this, but it seems like an ugly hammer. Is this some residual effect of the soon-to-disappear CalDAV support issue, or something else ?
