Can no longer sign in to @me.com or @icloud.com email address <body> A few days ago I started noticing notifications from my email clients that there was an authentication error for my email address ending in @me.com. I tried re-entering my password several times, I changed my password, tried the @icloud.com version of the email address but unfortunately, nothing worked. I can however, still sign in to webmail at iCloud.com, and to other Apple services using these credentials, just not email.  Does anyone know what can cause this? I have quite a few internet accounts that depend on this email address.  Kind regards, Roemer Bakker  <answer287267> You are probably hit by the 'App Specific Password' feature. Apple recently changed their policy for 'third-party' Apps and Clients to require a password differing from your main AppleID password.  The following Apple Support link: Using App-specific passwords is a good place to start.  <comment362632> You were right! Quite un-Apple like to send no notification of this whatsoever... I was kind of worried that they finally discontinued @me.com email addresses ha! Thank you for your help.
