Calendar entries showing up on wrong date <body> All of a sudden calendar entries are showing up on the day before, instead of on the date entered on my iPhone 6. Example: a meeting entered at 10:00 Monday, October 24 is showing up on Sunday, Oct 23.  <answer258494> Hard to say whether this is to do with your phone or another device, but it's possible it's a time zone issue.  You might check that your phone is set to the correct time zone (Settings  General  Date &amp; Time). There's also a time zone override option for the calendar (Settings  Calendar  Time Zone Override) which if enabled will override the time zone of your phone and show your appointments according to the override.  <comment323142> Welcome to Ask Different.
