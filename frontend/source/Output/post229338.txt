Change the input language to english when shift is pressed <body> On Windows and Linux, when I'm typing in Hebrew and pressing the kbdshift/kbd key, the input language automatically changes to upper case English (just while the shift is pressed, when I let it go it changes back to Hebrew).    Is this possible on OS X also?  <answer229341> Found a solution.. Switching to 'Hebrew - PC' keyboard instead of 'Hebrew' solved it :)  <answer229343> You can use strongcaps-lock/strong to enable a "second input layer" besides the Hebrew one.  On my system (Mavericks) the following applies if the Hebrew input source is the only available (besides the English one):   Normal Hebrew keyboard layout:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsTcV.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you strongactivate caps-lock/strong you can enable an English keyboard layer while using the Hebrew input source. The English keyboard layer works normally then: lower case English:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h9UZP.png" alt="enter image description here"  To enter upper case English you have to press the shift key additionally:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cXv0R.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  If you enable a third input source (in my example French) in the System Preferences switching first to French and then to Hebrew strongactivating caps-lock/strong will show a French layer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hTj4o.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you press the shift key additionally you will get upper key French.  <comment279764> Thanks @klanomath, I knew that caps-lock does that, but it isn't as comfortable as using the shift key since I'm using this feature a lot and I don't want to turn it on and off each time. <comment279791> You are right, I had never seen that.  On Hebrew (but not Hebrew PC or Hebrew Qwerty), the caps lock will shift to the last used Latin layout.  I wonder how they do that, it defies everything I know about how keyboard layouts are constructed. <comment279805> @TomGewecke This also works with the Georgian and the Myanmar input source (I haven't tested all but most non-latin input sources don't provide this feature). I guess it's related to the common use of/relation to latin alphabets in those languages/areas (Hebrew - Yiddish; Georgian - English?; Myanmar - English). <comment279810> it's long been common to have Latin available via capslock on certain keyboards.  But how you can have the layout change depend on an earlier event is a mystery.  These are normally just xml files which have no obvious way to refer to which keyboard was used just before.
