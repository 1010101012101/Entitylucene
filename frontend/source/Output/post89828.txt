iOS camera tap to focus animation <body> Is the iOS Camera app's "tap to focus" animation available somewhere that I can download and use? Preferably an array of images?  <answer89836> I know of none that are worth downloading.  You could easily record it yourself using AirPlay mirroring on the iOS device and a screen recording program like Reflector and Screeny if you have access to a machine that runs OS X.  <comment105517> This borderlines on too trivial for the site (we're not looking to be a dictionary or wiki or list that points at specific resources) but I am interested in the "what next" part of your question to see if others can learn how to record any animation on iOS - I'll assume that's what you really are seeking and answer that version of "what next". If I missed your focus, just edit in more details to the question and we can clean up or delete my answer as needed. <comment105519> Alright.So I'll manually have to cut it out and create it myself huh? <comment105521> That's what I do. I pick a nice out of focus background, or aim the camera at a large poster board of a pleasing color and light pattern and mock things up. You can also green screen it depending on how fancy you want to get in post production.
