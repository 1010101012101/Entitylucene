Get computer name from IP-address <body> I have the IP address of a computer on my network but is there a way that with the IP address I can find the name of computer?  For example, if I know the IP address is 192.154.23.60, can I use this IP from my Mac to see the name, such as Jacob's MacBook?  <answer98557> In Finder, go to your computer (which should be listed on the left sidebar under Devices). Then double-click on Network. This will show you all of the other computers on your network that are browsable.  <answer98578> From the codeTerminal.app/code (or equivalent) you can use the codehost/code command to show the network name of the computer. This returns the name even if it has all sharing settings turned off and thus not showing via codeFinder/code.  For example, in my network I get the following (where I know the IP-address and the first part of the returned name is the computer's name)  precodeâžœ ~ host 192.168.2.135  135.2.168.192.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer raspberrypi.private.lan. /code/pre  It depends on the actual name of the computer if the network name is emexactly/em the same, as in your example, I guess it would become codeJacobs-MacBook/code.  <answer98584> In Terminal I would use codearp/code  ul liFirst make sure you have sent at least one packet to this machine using ping.    precode$ ping -c 1 2.2.2.12   PING 2.2.2.12 (2.2.2.12): 56 data bytes     64 bytes from 2.2.2.12: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.981 ms   /code/pre/li liNext codearp/code that address.    precode$ arp 2.2.2.12   &lt;host&gt;.&lt;domain&gt; (2.2.2.12) at 0:1c:c4:f4:b8:c7 on en1 ifscope [ethernet] /code/pre/li /ul  <answer290859> Just Ping that ip address with -a option. It will show you the computer name. Example codeping -a 192.168.0.1/code  <answer290871> Without further access to the host (e.g. ssh or ARD) and no service running on it (e.g. iTunes Music Sharing/File Sharing) you can't get the computer name based on the IP-address.  The computer name in macOS is strongnot/strong necessarily indentical to the hostname or the Bonjour name! You can simply check this with codescutil --get { ComputerName | LocalHostName | HostName }/code. ComputerName is the user friendly name, LocalHostname is the Bonjour name - both also visible in System Preferences  Sharing - and HostName is the hostname of the device. The hostname is usually related to or used with DNS, NIS, hosts file or similar methods of name resolution. On a newly installed consumer system no hostname is set. ComputerName and LocalHostName are usually derived from the first user's name and the Mac model (e.g. Admin's iMac | Admins-iMac).  Without a name record for the remote Mac in your hosts file or on a DNS-server in your local or a public network neither of the tools mentioned in the other answers (arp, ping, host) can be used to resolve the hostname.  If a known Bonjour service is running on the remote Mac you can get the Computer and the Bonjour name of an IP in a two-step process by retrieving all hosts offering it with codedns-sd -Z _nfs._tcp local/code (the example service here is NFS - other service names can be found here) and pinging all listed Bonjour names until you find the proper IP. As an GUI alternative you can use the Bonjour Browser.  In some cases you can get a name similar to the Bonjour name by entering codesmbutil status &lt;IP&gt;/code. The name is the NetBIOS name which is the "all-caps and without allmost all special characters" version of the Computer/Bonjour name.  <comment115733> You can also go on your router's configuration page (192.154.23.1? or 192.154.23.254?) and look at each device's IP Address and corresponding name. <comment115758> @sameetandpotatoes you cannot rely on that in general. <comment115759> Thorbjorn, itt was merely another way to approach the issue, but I understand from reading the answers that this is not the preferred way to solve this. <comment115764> That is not what he is asking, he is trying to find the host name from the ip address. just because a mahine is one the network does not mean that it is exposing afp, smb or netfs. <comment115803> You're just doing an extra step with the ping+arp combination. `arp` is just calling the same thing as `host` to return the hostname. <comment344517> This does not for for me for local servers: On my iPad an app creates a server under say http://192.168.0.4:8080, which I can access from my Mac, but neither `host 192.168.0.4` nor `arp 192.168.0.4` give me a name back. <comment367151> The `-a` flag means *audible* (or ring the bell).  It has nothing to do with hostnames.  Refer to the [man page for ping](https://ss64.com/bash/ping.html) <comment367152> And the flag would have to be set directly after the command: `ping -a ...` <comment367544> oh yeah sorry man.. Its ping -a ... some time hand makes mistake while mind not.
