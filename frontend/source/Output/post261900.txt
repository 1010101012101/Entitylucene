How can i extend my partition further than the limit? Disk Utility <body> So I am trying to make my partition full size but there seems to be a limit. I am on OS X 10.8.5 using Disk Utility.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPRoy.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am using a MacBook 4,1 (early 2008)   Ok so I used MacPostFactor to install mountain lion with my friends copy of the installer. I deleted my Lion partition.

You will be able to create a new partition in the unallocated disk space and restore your existing emMountain Lion/em partition to it though. Then remove the old partition and expand the new one to the full size.

Either use a third-party tool like iPartition or create a new partition in the empty space and clone/restore  *Mountain Lion* to it. Then delete   *Mountain Lion (old)* and expand   *Mountain Lion(new)* to the full size. Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show disk0` entered in Terminal to your question. <comment328009> without knowing more it's VERY hard to approach this. could you type `diskutil cs list` and post the answer. this should print out the specific hard drive volume information needed to answer this question properly. thanks.
