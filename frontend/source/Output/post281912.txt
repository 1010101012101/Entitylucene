User Dropped from Group Text/MMS <body> I'm not 100% this is on topic here, but I think so because the problem seems to be specific to iPhones.  I'm working with a group text that has a mixed population of users and devices (iOS, Android, VOIP, and Google Voice).  When one non-iOS user replies to another non-iOS user, 1 particular user is dropped from the group thread.  On the non-iOS devices, this doesn't happen (everything is contained in one group thread as expected), but on most of the iPhones, one particular user is removed (always the same user) and it makes a new thread on these phones with 1 less participant.  In the group, 2 iPhones seem to behave as expected (containing the message to 1 thread with all users), the user that keeps getting dropped and one unrelated group member.  The other 8 iPhones all drop the 1 user.  Without the 1 user in the thread, the group message continues on all devices as expected.  This makes me suspect it's the one users device.  Are there some settings or other elements that can prevent this from happening?  The user who is being dropped has both SMS and MMS enabled (as do all other users), so I'm not sure what else would be governing this.  We also know that the user isn't blocking anyone.  Again, group texts are functioning as expected on the user who is being dropped, so it might be a setting on the other 8 iPhones (probably a default setting as it's the majority).  Edit: The phone themselves have now all been updated and the problem persists (3 phones required updating, the rest were current).  <comment354857> This could be a problem with another person's phone and not iPhones.  Your post is slightly confusing. <comment354861> @William Right, I have ready access to all phones and I'm trying to trouble shoot this for the group. <comment354863> I have had a similar same problem.  What OS version are all the devices on.  You assume it is some device but don't mention anything about the device which is slightly odd <comment354866> @William, I'm still trying to flesh out the full details (will be ~10hrs before I have physical possession again). All the iPhones are on 10, the one that's dropping is specifically 10.3.1 <comment354869> I have had issues with Android devices not iPhones so I'm afraid I can't help to much. The apple store would upgrade them to the newest OS and then would reimage them all if it still doesn't work.  That doesn't really help diagnosis the problem but it is interesting. <comment354924> @William I'm willing to entertain the issues is with Android phones, but the same problem occurs from Google Voice or a VOIP service, so I would think it's related to the iPhone?  We made sure all the phone were up to date this morning, and the problem is still occurring.  Is this question on topic here? <comment354925> It hasn't been closed yet so you are probably fine although I can't comment on lack of answers.  The other problem which seems unlikely is carrier support.  Can you narrow down the problem to just 2 phones? <comment354927> I think I need at least 4 phones to make the problem work: 2 non-iOS, the iPhone to be dropped, and an iPhone to drop it.  There are 4 carriers represented + the digital services, and there doesn't seem to be a pattern there. <comment354930> I think the limit is around 10 for carrier requirements https://forums.att.com/t5/Data-Messaging-Features-Internet/Group-text-message-recipient-limit/td-p/3999332 at leas for at&t you could be running into a similar issue although unlikely
