Avoid inadvertent "Shut Down" of Mac <body> For a Mac mini or such acting as a server in a server room or colo, accidentally choosing the codeApple &gt; Shut Down…/code menu item is a major problem. Without physical access, you cannot start the Mac up again.     Is there a way to strongmake it more difficult to inadvertently shut down/strong a Mac?   One workaround is to set codeSystem Preferences &gt; Energy Saver &gt; Schedule (button) &gt; Start up or wake (checkbox)/code to boot the computer, say 2:00 AM if you often do admin work at midnight. But I'm looking ways to avoid the shut down problem in the first place.  <answer178166> You could remove codeShut Down…/code from the menu entirely. This Ask Different question looks like it has instructions on how to do that. Good luck!  <comment210993> don't you get a 1 minute count down ? where you can stop it <comment211164> @Buscar웃 Yes, there's a countdown. But (1) that means the shutdown will occur if I look away, and (2) the default keystroke on the countdown dialog is the affirmative button, to immediately shutdown. Both of those behaviors are bad for a server. So, again, my question is about ways to avoid the problem in the first place (on server computers).
