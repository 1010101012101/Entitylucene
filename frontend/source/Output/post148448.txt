Ipod Classic 160GB shuffle issue <body> I just bought one of the last Ipod classics and for some reason when its in shuffle mode (songs - artists or playlists), it shuffles to the next track in the middle of the current song. odd? is there a solution?  thanks!  <answer148499> Could be drive or file damage.   I had something similar happen on my old classic. The 'fix' was to wipe &amp; restore - which took a long time [24h maybe], but worked.   One thing I've noticed about the classic with the slide-lock switch, don't attempt to sync with it locked.
