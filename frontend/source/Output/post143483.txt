Can I execute a Terminal command in a new tab? <body> It just occurred to me that it would be incredibly useful if I could type a command in one Terminal tab, and then execute it in a new background or foreground tab. For example, this would be awesome when editing files with codenano/code. I could codecd/code to a location and then quickly codenano sys_201406271933.log/code, codenano 415ab40ae9b7cc4e66d6769cb2c08106e8293b48.key/code two new background tabs. The alternative is to manually open two tabs and flip between them, using the mouse to copy-paste the long, unmemorable filenames.  I've spent about 30 minutes researching whether this is possible and found no satisfying answer.  <answer143495> iTerm 2 is a powerful replacement for Terminal.app and it has support for AppleScript. You can use AppleScript to tell it to run commands in a new tab or window.  For example, let's make a little AppleScript action that's callable. Enter the following in to the AppleScript Editor:  precodeon run argv     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {" "}     tell application "iTerm"         make new terminal         tell the current terminal             activate current session             launch session "Default Session"             tell the last session                 write text argv as string             end tell         end tell     end tell end run /code/pre  and then save it as a Script in code~/Documents/Scripts/run-in-new-iterm-tab.scpt/code. We can now call it from the command line like so:  precode/Users/ian &gt; osascript ~/Documents/Scripts/run-in-new-iterm-tab.scpt ls ~/Documents/Scripts  /Users/ian &gt; /code/pre  and I get a new tab in my iTerm session with:  precodeLast login: Thu Aug 28 22:17:17 on ttys003 ls /Users/ian/Documents/Scripts  /Users/ian &gt; ls /Users/ian/Documents/Scripts edit                         keep_drives_alive.sh         run-in-new-iterm-tab.scpt    touch-in-order.pl find-missing-itunes-files.pl keep_drives_alive.sh~        start-utorrent.scpt          touch-in-order.pl~  /Users/ian &gt; /code/pre  Which is not too bad. There are some refinements you can make to the AppleScript like maintaining the current working directory when you call the command. But that's gets you in the ballpark.  If you use this hint in this question you can turn the whole thing in to a bash-wrapped script that's even easier to execute:  precode#!/usr/bin/env osascript  on run argv     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {" "}     tell application "iTerm"         make new terminal         tell the current terminal             activate current session             launch session "Default Session"             tell the last session                 write text argv as string             end tell         end tell     end tell end run /code/pre  Save that to a spot on your codePATH/code and make it executable and then you only need to run:  precoderun-in-new-iterm-tab ls ~/Documents/Scripts /code/pre  to get it to work.  <comment168989> Are you tied to nano? Texteditors such as [Textmate](http://macromates.com) are much easier to work with and implement directly from your shell once you define the `$EDITOR` variable in your `~/.bash_profile` or the like. That said, it is possible with nano. <comment168990> I use GitHub's Atom editor for most things, but sometimes it's convenient to just stick to the terminal. I would also like to be able to run other types of commands like `man`. Being able to send a manpage to a new tab would be a godsend. <comment168992> This may be possible using AppleScript.

This is the best answer taking into account 1) iTerm 2 is free , 2) provided fail proof instructions, 3) achieves your desired outcome.  [@Ian C.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/292/ian-c) is this type of solution feasible by customizing [Textmate's script](http://www.nanoant.com/programming/opening-specified-path-in-terminals-new-tab) in similar manner?
