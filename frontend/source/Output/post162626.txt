Adobe Flash player won't install on my mac <body> I'm trying to update Adobe Flash player on my mac OsX 10.6 with Safari. Everything was working out in the update process until I clicked 'Install Adobe Flash player' and it requested my mac's username and password for permission. I entered the correct information, clicked 'ok', and nothing happened. Usually, the installer is supposed to come up but instead nothing happens.  <comment190169> which adobe player from which website?
