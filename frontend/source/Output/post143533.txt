Get rid of WW8Num* list styles upon exporting from Pages? <body> Context:  precode    MacOS X 10.8.5     Pages â€™09 /code/pre  From codePages/code upon exporting a file to a code.doc/code format, I get a file with more than 20 new list styles with names of the form:  precode    WW8Num* /code/pre  These list styles don't correspond to the ones I defined within codePages/code and are associated to lists I defined some other styles for.  Since I have to work from there on this .doc file, I need to remove or change all these codeWW8Num*/code list styles.  hr  Is there a method to avoid this useless creation of codeWW8Num*/code list styles?  Is there a method to get rid of them emefficiently/em?
