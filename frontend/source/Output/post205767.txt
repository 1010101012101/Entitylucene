How do I alt+f4 in OS X? I want to close focused window <body> I am looking for a way to close the currently focused window using a keyboard shortcut. Effectively I want to do the same thing as the red "X" button in the top left corner, only using a keyboard. On windows/linux this is done by Kbdalt/Kbd+Kbdf4/Kbd  I know about:  ul liKbd⌘ Cmd/Kbd+Kbdw/Kbd - in any tabbed application such as google chrome it will close the current tab instead of current window/li liKbd⌘ Cmd/Kbd+Kbdq/Kbd - will close the entire app instead of just the current window/li /ul  <answer205771> I believe that Kbd⌘ Cmd/Kbd+Kbdw/Kbd IS what you are looking for.   It doesn't just work for tabbed applications, such as browsers.   I tested it in Finder this morning, the OS X Mail App, as well as Microsoft Word and Excel.   All of those support using the Kbd⌘ Cmd/Kbd+Kbdw/Kbd combination to close the current window.     <answer205773> KbdShift/Kbd+Kbd⌘ Cmd/Kbd+Kbdw/Kbd does what you want in Safari and Chrome. I don't think it's a system-wide standard, though.  strongUpdate:/strong It works in Finder too so maybe it is a standard.  <answer205779> BetterTouchTool (http://www.bettertouchtool.net) lets you assign many actions to trackpad and magic mouse gestures / mouse buttons / keyboard shortcuts. The "Close Window below cursor" action might be close to what you want  <answer205876> I think it's more like Kbd⌘ Cmd/Kbd+KbdQ/Kbd.  Or you can open a terminal and codekillall MyApplication/code  <comment248137> cmd/shift/w is a pretty much the global command for 'close all windows'. As most apps on Mac won't quit when the last window is closed, I guess this is as close as you will get, but it is not the equivalent of alt/F4, as that will quit the frontmost process. On Windows, having two windows open means you have two running processes, on Mac it doesn't. <comment248153> I am hesitant about installing apps outside of app store (aside of big players such as google chrome), I simply do not trust most authors <comment248177> Well, I (kinda) understand that. The developer (Andreas Hegenberg, blog.boastr.net) has been developing BetterTouchTool, among other tools (some of which are also released on the app store), for more than 4 (?) years. It has been reviewed by many journalists (for example on Macworld macworld.com/article/1157058/trackpadtricks.html) and is widely used by Mac users.  BetterTouchTool is, in my opinion, a Macbook's killer "app". Many great applications (not apps, *applications*) only exist outside the app store. Being careful about what you install and from where is important, but don't miss out!
