MacBook shows it is charging when MagSafe is green <body> My MacBook currently shows this img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UVIdc.png" alt="enter image description here" even though the MagSafe charger has a green light.  Does anyone know why this is?  If it helps I am on a MacBook Air late 2010 with 819 cycle counts, 4,995mAh (currently), max capacity is 4,995mAh and the original capacity is 6,700mAh. I am also running codemake/code in terminal which has set my fans on and is making my computer lag a bit since it has a lot to install.  Could the issue be the process it using a lot of power?  strongEdit/strong  Just clicked on my battery in the toolbar while pressing alt and found out it says codeservice battery/code could this be a reason as well? (the message keeps appearing and disappearing)  <answer175834> reset SMC  look up how to reset SMC on macbook's without removable battery  <comment207502> Could it also be because there is a warning sating `service battery?`
