mDNSResponder missing <body> I am on Yosemite since today and am trying to connect to network printers, but System Preferences doesn't show any. The printers use Bonjour and I read that the associated process is mDNSresponder. Checking Activity Monitor I see it is not running. Googling how to manually restart it reveals tips such as these.  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist /code/pre  However, the code.plist/code file does not exist, neither does code/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder/code.  The thing is that the printer problem existed even before I upgraded from 10.7.5 to 10.10, so I cannot judge whether this is a Yosemite issue or not, or wether the mDNSResponder stuff is even the source. I also don't know if I had the files before (although at some point I must have).  How do I enable Bonjour on Yosemite?  <answer153629> codemDNSResponder/code was replaced by codeDiscoveryUtil/code in Yosemite. So Bonjour is still enabled. According to this Apple-kb article you might have to download updated printer drivers from Apple or the original manufacturer or re-add your printer with a different set up.br If you still have problems discovering your printer an Apple-discussion-thread might help:  unblock discoveryd in the firewall preferences and an immediate reboot...  <comment180829> I see. Do you know how to detect whether Bonjour is running on  10.10? i.e., what process do I look for? <comment180836> discoveryd and discoveryd_helper. 'sudo discoveryutil help' in Terminal gives a plethora of possible commands
