US International - PC keyboard layout problem with single quotation mark <body> I replaced my Mac's hard drive and hard drive cable a while ago and every since I've been having a problem with my keyboard layout/settings.  I cloned my Mac's HD before replacing it so it should be the same and in fact I haven't noticed any other differences or problems after the replacement.  Basically the problem is that before, typing the single quotation mark with a letter (like s, v, t, etc.) that doesn't combine with it into a special character would output the quotation mark and the letter. Now it only outputs the quotation mark and I have to type the letter twice in order to output it.  So before typing 's would output 's. 'e still outputs Ã©  anyone familiar with this weird problem?  <comment329904> I'm a little confused. So now to get 's you have to type 'ss ? <comment329907> yep. or typing 'ts or 'zs etc. will also yield 's <comment330025> Is this for all apps including TextEdit, Mail, Safari? <comment330152> There it actually works as it should! so typing 's gives 's :) So apparently it's for non-Apple apps only... <comment330158> So what apps are you talking about exactly?  You should add that info to your question, as it really is crucial. <comment330395> I supposed it was throughout the whole OS, but now I realized that it's only in Firefox.
