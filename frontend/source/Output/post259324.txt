Apple Music (?) keeps messing up album art work <body> I have iTunes plus Apple Music setup with all files offline (downloaded). I use heavy metadata changes 100% specific to me. I have 1000+ CD's all ripped and also with nice Album art.  I now found out that Apple/iTunes/Apple Music/Something (?) is changing my album art in the background in a way I cannot follow. For some albums just one or two songs are changed, for other albums (limited) album art for all songs is changed.  I followed all the instructions, so under Preferences / Store I do not have the "automatic download album art ticked.  It appears that every time I have iTunes open for a while it start doing things in the background. As far as my test goes it is my understanding that everything remains the same as long as I do not open iTunes.  I have all my music on a backup so it is relatively easy to see what the changes are (I just used the app SynchTwoFolders for that). We are talking about hundreds and hundreds of changes.  Anybody an idea what is going on and how to solve? Can I perhaps force a kind of "read only" in a way that Apple apps also cannot touch my files anymore?  Thanks in advance.
