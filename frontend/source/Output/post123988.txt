How to add a .crt certificate to iPhone's keychain? <body> I moved a code.crt/code certificate file onto my iPhone device via Dropbox and tried following these instructions to add it to the device keychain:  It suggests to open the certificate file but my iPhone doesn't know what to open the .crt with?  How should I proceed from here to add the certificate to my keychain?  <answer124220> Copied from the site you linked      If you wish to use your certificate for S/MIME after you have followed this guide, please visit https://support.quovadisglobal.com/KB/a353/how-do-i-sign-and-encrypt-on-an-apple-iphone.aspx.   Important Note: Apple recommends that a *.p12 or *.pfx file is sent to your device as an attachment in an email.  QuoVadis does not recommend this approach unless email access to your mail server is encrypted using SSL.     You need to e-mail yourself the certificate, other 3PP programs are sandbox'd from accessing the iOS keychain.  <comment144865> Do you need the .crt for a specific app? If so, you can probably import it via iTunes, if you connect your phone and switch to the Apps tab and select the app <comment144881> I have my own .crt that I need to access an SSL app from the iPhone
