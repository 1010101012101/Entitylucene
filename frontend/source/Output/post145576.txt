Updating Native Mac OSX Mavericks Apache 2.2 to 2.4 - disabling old version? <body> I have a small problem when I try to update to the new version of Apache WebSrvr on my Mavericks Mac.  I compiled and make installed to a different folder than the native: /usr/local/apache24/.  which httpd  = /usr/local/apache24/bin/  I set the enviroment variable for it also.  which apachectl = /usr/local/apache24/bin/apachectl  but when I try to start the server it takes the the binaries from the /usr/local/apache2/  Is there a way to migrate everything to the new instance of the Apache Server?  <answer147099> Since there is no answer I found out something:  Best way to get past the problems from my question:  ul listop the apache server: codesudo apachectl stop/code/li liBackup/rename these files in the default apache folder: ab, httpd &amp; apachectl  codesudo mv /path/to/file/ab /path/to/file/ab.old/code/li liCreate links in the default apache folder:  codesudo ln -s /path/to/originalfile/ab /path/to/where_the_link_should_be_saved/ab/code/li liStart apache:   codesudo apachectl start/code/li liCheck if the changes were taken:  codehttpd -v/code  codeapachectl -v/code/li /ul  It should be version 2.4.10 now:)  <comment171603> How do you start the server? <comment171607> im starting with sudo apachectl start. then it says that port cannot be registered. its just a mess I tell you. if id change the http.conf from native apache: i get an error that apachectl cannot be started. then i changed the script to use one in the updated one. but the default is always taken from the native. <comment171611> Is the old apache still running (port can't be registered could mean that another process is already using it)? <comment171612> how exactly do you stop the old one? About the port: yeah i think thats because both of them want to access to the same port. with the lsof -i | grep :80 i get that httpd (2x) is listening to the port one from root user and one from _www. <comment171614> `sudo apachectl stop` :-) May not work anymore though, but you should still be able to `kill` it. Or reboot. <comment171617> so i just rewrite the httpds with originals- stop server - and then just use the apachectl fron apache24 binaries? <comment171725> after a reboot i got thrown back to the default values. meaning that `which httpd`produces the output "/usr/sbin/httpd". What's going on?
