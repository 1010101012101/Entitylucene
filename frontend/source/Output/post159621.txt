Mail.app message selection gets reset when clearing the search box <body> If I search for something in my mailbox, select the message I'm interested in, then clear the search box (because I want to see the other messages that came in around the same time), the selection resets and I lose my selected message.  I thought there was once some option like "View message in mailbox" that could be used to select a given message without filtering out everything else, but I can't find it anywhere.    Am I imagining things?  Does this still exist?  -- Edit --  Trying to clarify with screencaps.  ol liI search for and select a message.  /li /ol  img src="https://i.imgur.com/NRZcT9z.png" alt="Imgur"  ol start="2" liI clear the search./li /ol  img src="https://i.imgur.com/qEBblal.png" alt="Imgur"  ul liThe message I had selected has been deselected/li liThe message list pane has scrolled back to the top/li /ul  What I want is for the message I had selected to still be selected, or at least visible on the screen.  <answer176616> Answering (sort of) my own question.  When making the screenshots I added to the question, I happened to turn off the "Organize by Conversation" option, and it suddenly worked!  When clearing the search box, the selected message remains selected.  Moreover, this also happens:  ol liTurn on "Organize by Conversation"/li liEnter some search term/li liSelect a message/li liClear the search box -- the message will be deselected/li liTurn off "Organize by Conversation"/li liThe previously selected message is strongreselected/strong/li /ol  So I guess the "answer" is that "Organize by Conversation" is simply a shoddy feature that Apple bolted onto their mail client without caring too much how well it works.  <comment187586> Are you sure you loose them? if you do the same search again are they there or not ? <comment199274> No, it's still there if I search again.  The problem is that I can't see it "in context" -- I want to see the mailbox the message is in, with the message selected.  But when I clear the search box, it deselects the message.  If it's in a mailbox with thousands of messages (which is generally why I'm searching in the first place) I have to manually browse through the mailbox trying to find it. <comment199275> ok let me try that on my mail <comment207710> sorry your request does not makes sense to me--deleted my answer
