How do you access shared folders on a Windows machine from a MacBook Air? <body> How do I connect to my Windows machine from my MacBook Air? I have tried using the Finder but it doesn't see the Windows machine.  <answer191713> Command-K in the Finder  The address should be codesmb://&lt;Windows IP or Hostname&gt;/code  Hope this helps!  <answer191771> ol liBoth machines are on the same network./li liFile sharing is enabled on the windows machine's active network connection. Also both machines are using the same workgroup./li liYes, shares have been created on the windows machine.The shares are read write enabled./li liChanged the shares to be public guest accessible and visible on all networks and then they finally showed up in the finder./li /ol  <comment227752> 1) Are both machines on the same network? 2) Is File & Print Sharing enabled on the Windows machine's active network connection? 3) Have any shares been created on the Windows machine? 4) If #3 is a yes, what permissions have been set for those shares? 5) Presuming you've dealt with #'s 3 & 4, are you attempting to access said shares via a user account which has the proper access and permissions for the shares?  Typically, 1-3 absolutely need to happen before the Windows machine will even show up in the Finder sidebar. <comment227834> it might be good to add something there: smb://[Windows IP Address]/c$. If you add the "/c$" at the end it will explicitly map to the root of the boot drive which is usually "C" then give it a username in the form of "[computername]\administrator" and the the Administrator's password. You can substitute your own username in place of administrator if you have admin rights. <comment227861> Please edit your original post to add the request information, rather than posting as an answer.
