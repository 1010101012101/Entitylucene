SSH based VPN with tun device <body> On the codessh/code man page there is a section called codeSSH-BASED VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS/code which explains how to setup a poor mans VPN with codessh/code (codessh/code flag code-w/code). This section is also included in the OSX man page.  As far as I understand OSX does not support codetun/code devices out of the box and even with the tuntap kernel driver it doesn't seem to work out of the box.  Has anybody had any luck using this functionality on OSX? Care to explain how you did it?
