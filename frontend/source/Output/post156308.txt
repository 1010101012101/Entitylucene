Use mp3 in My Music as a ring tone <body> I just got an iPhone5S and want to use an mp3 I have in My Music as a ring tone.  How can I do this. The manual only seems to talk about purchasing tones.

I cannot find  "Sync Ringtones" in the phone sync options.  <answer156314> There a few ways to do that.  Follow instructions on this website.
