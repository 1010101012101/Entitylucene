Can I remove out-dated coloring from Apple Mail "Rules" settings? <body> After experimentation with Apple Mail, Rules settings, I'm left with a rainbow-colored inbox, and strongI want to remove all of that coloring which is no longer specified by my Rules settings./strong I've tried using the "apply rules" command after selecting all messages, but all prior messages remain colored improperly.   strongHow can I do this?/strong  ul liI can't somehow "factory reset" Apple Mail, our tech guy will not be happy if the settings of the mail server, etc is messed up. /li liI can't delete my message history, the old messages must be kept. /li /ul  <answer192006> The simples to way to do that for the OSX 10.7.5 - Mail 5.3  I believe it is done in Fonts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uH9hL.jpg" alt="fonts"  <comment228196> cross posting, was told Ask Different was better for my question than Super User. http://superuser.com/questions/928325/can-i-remove-out-dated-coloring-from-rules-in-apple-mail <comment228198> It's preferable to request migration by flagging for a moderator than reposting. <comment228227> This works for one message at a time, (select message then double click on a color swatch), but with all messages selected, it has no effect. <comment228234> I just tried it again and it works for multiple selected. I do not use double click. I click once then select color. <comment228236> Ahh... Our Macs are on OSX 10.7.5 - Mail 5.3 <comment228246> That is exactly the reason why it helps disclosing the OS and versions in the question. <comment228255> Fonts works for me.
