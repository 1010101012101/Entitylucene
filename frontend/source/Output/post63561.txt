iCal: How do I add new event types with new colors? <body> So iCal has "Work" and "Home" as two of its default event types associated with the colors green and blue respectively.  How do I add a third event type, say "School", and set its color to be something other than blue or green, say red?  <answer63569> You can add one on iCloud or on your Mac. Just navigate to 'emFile/em' and create a 'emNew Calendar/em'.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Saqda.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And there, you'll be able to create a new calendar, and with 'emGet Info/em' (right-click), you can choose your color.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vfPcq.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2iNIe.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
