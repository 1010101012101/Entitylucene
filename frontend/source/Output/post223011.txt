iMac12,2 loses router connectivity, doesn't realize it <body> Does anyone have information about the mid-2011 27" iMac model (12,2) having a faulty wifi card?  With OS X Yosemite and El Capitan (though possibly before that too) it will lose wi-fi connectivity: even pinging the router fails. The router and other devices are just fine. OS X does not realize anything is wrong and reports no problem, full bars, even reads out that there's a good 30 dB between the noise and signal. It simply stops receiving bytes. Turning wi-fi off and back on solves the issue. It then comes back again randomly - could be an hour, could be five minutes.  The wireless card Apple uses in this particular model is an Atheros 9380. As of El Capitan 10.11.2 the firmware version is 4.0.74.0-P2P.  This problem emmight/em be exacerbated when the wi-fi signal is on the lower side: I've got it around 60% and the issue happens fairly frequently and seems not to happen when the iMac has better signal. The 60% signal really isn't a problem - I've got a computer five years older sitting a few feet away, same distance from the router, that while slow does not receive these dropouts. It really is emnot/em the router or Internet connection itself.  Any ideas? All the usual PRAM resets, deleting Network Connection plist files, etc. doesn't seem to matter. Seems like an honest firmware / OS X bug to me.  <comment270275> Anything about the access point? What make is it? <comment270585> I've tried two different APs, one a recent model from Netgear, the other a Time Capsule circa 2011. No other device on the network has an issue. I recently added an Airport Extreme as an ethernet bridge for the iMac and it's been working flawlessly. I really do think there's something about the Atheros 9380's firmware.
