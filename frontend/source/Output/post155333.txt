Change the menu bar icon of WhatPulse <body> I'd like to make the WhatPulse icon white to make it match the rest of the icons in Yosemite dark mode.   I've looked in the package contents of WhatPulse.app, but I don't find any images in the resources. Does anyone know where they're hidden?  <comment182719> WhatPulse isn't a native app and doesn't seem to use the standard OS X menu bar item framework (+1) <comment182720> Would you have an idea where else the resources could be hidden?
