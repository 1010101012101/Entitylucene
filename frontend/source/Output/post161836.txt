Make a specific tag the default window in OS X Finder <body> I've got a tag in OS X which is labeled "To-do", and I want that Finder shows the files (and folders) that are labelled with this tag when I open a new finder window. So that the view that is shown when I click the tag in the sidebar to be set as Finders default view for new windows.   I have tried changing the option of default location in Finders settings, but I can only choose folders there. I have also tried using a smart folder with the tag as the only search condition, but smart folders are also not allowed to be chosen as default location in Finder. Right now I'm using "all my files" as default location, sorted by tag where I made sure that my "To-do" tag is at top, by naming it "1To-do". However, this is also unsatisfactory, since "all my files" does not show the folders that I've tagged.  <answer163039> As you have tried, Smart folders/Saved Searches by themselves can't be used as the default location.  However, they can be made into Canned Searches, which you can use for new windows.  Here is what you need to do.  ol liCreate a new folder called To-Do (which will become the Canned Search) into your Documents folder./li liSwitch back to your home folder/li liRun a search with the To-Do tag as the query and the Search value to either "This Mac" or your home folder./li liClick the Save button in the upper right corner/li liBy default, it will be showing the code~/Library/Saved Searches/code folder.  Instead, switch to the To-Do folder you created in step 1./li liSave the search with the name codesearch.savedSearch/code/li liOpen your Documents folder/li liSelect and Get Info on the To-Do folder/li liExpand the Name &amp; Extension section/li liRename the folder from codeTo-Do/code to codeTo-Do.cannedSearch/code and press Return/li liEnable the Hide Extension checkbox below, which should become available after renaming, then close the Get Info window./li liOpen the Finder menu and choose Preferences/li liClick the "New Finder window show" pop-up menu and choose "Other..."/li liBrowse to your Documents folder and choose the "To-Do" entry/li liClose the Finder Preferences window/li /ol  Now whenever you open a new Finder window, it will show your To-Do search results.  Hope that helps!  <comment190212> I think that's the only way to display it, like you describe in the end, also try with no progress.
