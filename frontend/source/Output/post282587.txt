Deleted photo in iCloud but it is still on the iPhone <body> I have an iPhone SE running t 10.2.1. I have  ul liiCloud Photo Library on/li liDownload and Keep Originals selected/li liUpload my photo stream off/li liiCloud photo sharing on/li liSummarise Photos on/li /ul  When I delete a photo from my icloud, it says  Delete 1 item from all your devices? This item will be deleted from iCloud Photo Library on all your devices.  It gets added to the Recently Deleted folder. When I go to Recently deleted and click delete permanently, it is still on my phone, even a week later.  Is this the correct behaviour? How do I make it so photos removed from iCloud are deleted from the phone or is this not how it works?
