Files copied into external hard Drive are permission denied <body> I took a backup of all data in my macbook pro to a external hard drive, back then while the copying process was on, it asked for the password, which I think meant, that some of the files weren't given permission for all.   Now that I've done that, and my macbook is in for repair, I try to access those files via my ubuntu desktop. I run into trouble with accessing the one's I do not have a permission to access. Can I somehow, using some terminal command, gain access to the contents of files and folders that apparently I have no permission of access. I am guessing if I provide my macbook's password to it, I could then gain access.
