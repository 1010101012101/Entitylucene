How do I specify which Facebook birthdays show up in Calendar? <body> I do not want to disable all birthday events from showing up in Calendar from Facebook data, but I would like to specifically enable those that do.  Is there a way to do this?  <comment331661> No that is not possible. Only when you add Facebook friend manually to your contacts and add the birthdays... Then turn off the Facebook account in your contacts preferences.
