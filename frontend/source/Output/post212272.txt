My Instagram photos on my iPhone <body> The pictures on my Instagram (not my account) are all blurry, and the videos won't work. Not all pictures and videos do it though, just some.  <answer212280> Welcome to Ask Different!  I had this issue when I updated to iOS9 (though I think I could play videos, I don't remember). All it was is I missed the Instagram update. Here is the question I asked: Why have pictures on Instagram got blurry since my iPad has been updated to iOS9?    <comment256299> Did you update to iOS9 then it started happening?
