Mac says I'm using more space than I have? <body> When I checked my storage for my Mac it says that I have over 200 GB in movies. First, I do not have that many movies. Second, my Mac can only hold 128 GB. How can I fix this?  Update: I just deleted a couple of videos and the storage space changed accordingly. It used to be 214.06 GB and now it is 201 GB.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tFamc.png" alt="Mac Hard disk usage"  Screenshot of DiasyDisk contradicting what it says in the previous screenshot. Ignore exact numbers I deleted quite a few things last night (completely irrelevant to the movies).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GwTqm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189100> It's possible that there are some hard links pointing to video files which is confusing the storage calculator.  Time Machine will do this; but, it should not occur on your main partition.  So, the exact cause is a mystery.  For example, for a 3GB file linked to two locations, the space might calculate as 6GB (3GB plus 3GB), even though only 3GB is used.    There is this question at strongSuper User/strong which might help you isolate the files as well.  <comment224040> Use something like [DaisyDisk](http://daisydisk.com) to determine what is using the storage. Also, if it says you are using 200GB in movies, then your drive is larger than 128GB. Are you sure it's not saying 200**MB**? <comment224043> @tubedogg I've already use programs like that. But it is not a matter of storage. My mac says that my capacity is 128 GB, it also says on the box. But it clearly says in my storage that I have over 200gb's in movies. However, it says that I have 40.73 gb's of space available. So I'm only using around  80 gb's. <comment224045> If you removed files totaling ~14GB, and the amount of storage listed as used decreased by the same amount, then the files are clearly there and being stored somewhere. If you've already used a program like DaisyDisk, then remove whatever the offending files are and your storage usage should decrease. In any event, I wouldn't worry too much about what that usage meter shows. Your system will notify you if you are actually running low on storage on your boot drive. <comment224048> @tubedogg I'm not worried. I know I have a lot of space on my mac. The thing is that the files are not there. I've looked for these movies and cannot find them. Also it wouldn't make sense for those movies to be there, because that means those movies actually exist and alone they take up more space than I am allowed. I just want to fix this glitch. <comment224049> What does DaisyDisk show? <comment224050> It says that I'm using 80GB out of 120GB. And I've deleted all the movies it showed me. Which proves that this is some kind of glitch/error. <comment224054> Can you add screenshots showing the different windows/graphics with the conflicting space information? <comment224056> @patrix Not sure what you mean. Do you mean images saying how much space is available on my mac? <comment224060> You are getting the information about the 200 GB from somewhere (an application or something). A screenshot of this would help to understand what you are looking at. <comment224197> i added two sceenshots. Hopefully they help.
