Finder crash other apps <body> After Sierra update I got one annoying problem with macOS. All apps, which use Finder to browse files are crashing, if I use keyboard to navigate through folders.  For example, if I use Lightroom to select directory for Export and use arrow keys to navigate in Finder popup-window, then it will crash after few seconds. This is not happening if I will use cursor.  Same with other apps (not only Lightroom). How can I debug and solve this?
