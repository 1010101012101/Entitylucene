Is it possible to sync the Do Not Disturb mode between Mac and iPhone? <body> So when I turn on the Do Not Disturb mode on a mac it would be active also on my iPhone?  <answer234873> Unfortunately no, but this is something I would also greatly appreciate.  <comment268523> [Similar question here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/201499/turn-on-do-not-disturb-mode-on-all-devices-from-one-device?rq=1) but no answer.
