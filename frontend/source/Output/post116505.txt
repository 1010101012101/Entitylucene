How to gracefully import CSV files into Numbers.app v3? <body> I have a process, which has worked faithfully for years in Numbers '09, whereby I download my Bank account data in CSV format, then drag that data directly into my Numbers sheet (after creating an appropriate number of blank rows).    This no longer works, and I can't find an option to import csv! A help search within numbers for 'csv' returns a single result which describes exporting.  I've tried the old method, no dice.  Also, the menu option: Insert  Choose… doesn't permit .csv to be selected.  At the moment, my workaround is:  ul lidrag the CSV onto the Numbers dock or task-switcher icon to create a temp sheet/li liselect and copy the content/li lipaste-and-match-format into my desired location/li liclose don't save the temp file/li /ul  Doe anyone know a better way? A hack or hidden flag I can toggle to get the old functionality back?  <answer135917> Just remembered this question…   Dragging and dropping a CSV onto a table works again since v3.2!  <answer157581> So the Apple thread recommended changing the txt to csv. This didn't work, my file was already csv, properly formated etc. No, changing strongemto/em/strong txt did the trick.br I'm finding it harder and harder to recommend switching from Microsoft to Apple. This sort thing just shouldn't be happening.  <answer163692> Use 'tab' delimited fields - works perfectly.  <answer193225> I have faced a similar problem: after exporting a csv file from MySQL I tried to open directly into Numbers but it did not open correctly so I tried to drag the file onto an open sheet and it also and did not work.  Then I read lot of things on Internet about how Numbers deals with comma, so I exported the data once again switching comma (,) for semicolon (;) and voilà!  <answer231406> Simple solution for getting a csv file to open correctly on a Mac. Change the csv file extension to txt. Then right click on it and open with Numbers.  <comment136300> Sounds like a case for http://www.apple.com/feedback/numbers.html I do not know of a better way than to notify Apple that the functionality is missing and should be patched with an update. Fingers crossed for soon <comment136448> Tx! yeah, I submitted feedback, also started a thread here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/24438241#24438241 <comment235799> that did the trick for me too! <comment270171> Would have been +1 for the method, but overwhelmed by the -1 for the gripe.
