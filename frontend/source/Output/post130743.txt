How can I map `Ctrl+Alt+Char` and `Ctrl+Number` in vim on Mac OSX? <body> h11.Enviroment/h1  Env: vim+zsh+iTerm2 on Mac OSX 10.9.2. (Same problems in macvim on Mac OSX 10.9.2)  h12. Mapping Problem/h1  In mac, mappings for code&lt;A-char&gt;/code won't directly work in mac.  precode:inoremap &lt;A-u&gt; type some string A-u :inoremap &lt;A-p&gt; type some string A-p :inoremap i  õ           * type some string A-u i  ð           * type some string A-p /code/pre  As far as I know about code&lt;A-char&gt;/code in mac, hit code&lt;A-u&gt;/code will print nothing but with a sound alert. hit code&lt;A-p&gt;/code will print codeπ/code. I found that map for codeπ/code works well.  precode:inoremap π type some string A-p /code/pre  Is it possible to map code&lt;A-u&gt;/code in vim? Yes! Let me  go into  this problem deeply:  precode:map &lt;A-S-p&gt; not work :map ∏ works well(A-S-p will print `∏`)  :map &lt;C-A-p&gt; not work :map &lt;C-π&gt; still not work  :map &lt;C-S-p&gt; do work :map &lt;C-1&gt; not work /code/pre  strongSo , is it possible to map codeCtrl-Alt-char/code and codeCtrl+Number/code?/strong  hr  Of course, you can use fastcodes in vimfastcodes in vim. Refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23606892/vim-keyboard-mapping-problems-in-mac/23608928#23608928   <answer168693> If you use MacVim, the easiest way is:  precodeset macmeta /code/pre  So that MacVim will treat alt/option as Meta key, you can then bind:  precodenmap &lt;C-M-S&gt; :call foo_func() /code/pre  The keys pressed for above is: Ctrl+alt+s.  Hope this helps and solves your issue, happy Vimming!  <comment198114> It only works in macvim.app, not work in macvim's terminal vertion. <comment198603> You can override sys default vim with: brew install macvim --override-system-vim
