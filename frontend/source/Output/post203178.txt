Using mouse from OSX host on iOS device <body> Is it possible to use a mouse connected to OSX computer at iOS device. Assume I have a Mac Mini and iPad on same WiFi network. I have a USB mouse connected to Mac Mini. Is there an option to use this USB mouse on iPad remotely (via WiFi) ?   I mean something like Synergy - but Synergy work only on Windows, OSX and Linux. I want to one if there is something similar but for iOS and OSX or for Android and OSX.  <answer203183> Currently, the answer is no. iOS does not have a built in cursor function(unless you count the new keyboard cursor is iOS 9). In order to use a mouse on an iPad at all, you would probably need to jailbreak it.   <answer203184> The design of iOS makes remote control not possible in the manner of KVM/remote pointer control.  There is no concept of pointer in iOS since the touch interface is multi-touch from the get go.  You could enable switch control or voiceover control and theoretically interface with that over the supported or non-supported (jailbreak) channel, but it's still not a true mouse pointer idiom.  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/ios/accessibility-tips//li /ul  There's tons of software on OS X for remote control of other devices, but you'd need to be more specific to let us help you. Nothing works from OS X to both Android or iOS due to design and architectural differences in those OS and interface design.
