TimeMachine on macOS Server works with Sierra clients, not with El Capitan Clients or Lion Clients <body> I have a dedicated external HD for our office to use with the Time Machine service in the macOS Server.app (5.3).  Works flawlessly with Sierra clients, yet the disk will not show at all on El Capitan clients, or some intranet Lion workstations we have.   When you go to select a Time Machine disk on these clients, the disk on the server doesn't even show up, but will connect via afp using CMD+K.  What am I doing wrong?  Thanks in advance.
