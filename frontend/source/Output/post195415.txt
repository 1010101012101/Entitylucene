Applescript Producing Error when Sending Messages <body> I have this Applescript code that sends a message to a given contact. However, I get this runtime error:  precodeCan’t get «class pres» "a_name@gmail.com" of application "Messages". /code/pre  The important part of the code:  precodetell application "Messages"     set theBuddy to buddy theName     repeat theTimes times         send theMessage to theBuddy     end repeat end tell /code/pre  codetheBuddy/code is the email address, codetheTimes/code is the number of iterations, and codetheMessage/code is the message to be sent. So why is producing this error, and how do I fix this?  Thanks  <comment233309> Can't repro using that snippet. Working fine here. Are you using an email address as 'theName'? Should be a contact name, as listed in your address book, I'd think - like 'Fred Bloggs' <comment233317> Can't reproduce either. Strange.
