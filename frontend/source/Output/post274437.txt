-bash: alias: /path/to/folder: not found <body> Mac OS Sierra, 10.12.3  I inserted this line into my code.bash_profile/code:  precodealias myfolder="cd ~/path/to/folder" /code/pre  But when I type this into Terminal:  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  I get this error:  precode-bash: alias: Users/myuser/path/to/folder: not found /code/pre  Basically, I want to be able to type "myfolder" from anywhere in the directory structure and have it change to that alias path. But I haven't been able to get it to work.  strongEDIT:/strong Sorry, I was already using the codecd/code command. Edited the question to reflect this.  <answer274438> You are mixing bash alias, macOS alias and (soft-)link.  The bash alias requires some executable to be called but a path to a folder is no executable.  So use codealias myfolder='cd ~/path/to/folder'/code in your .bash_profile to change to the desired directory. code~/path/to/folder/code has to be a valid path of course - or it won't work.  <comment345052> Well, the error means that `path/to/folder` doesn't exist. Can you post the contents of your home directory? (do `cd ~; ls -la`) <comment345053> Folders in Unix _are_ executable ( do an `ls -la` in a directory and you'll find the `x` permission set). If you type in the name of a folder, you will be changed to that directory. If the directory exists, the alias will work. <comment345054> @KisaAyano No, a folder isn't executable - it's searchable! <comment345056> EDIT: They are in zsh, not bash. I've been in zsh-land too long and forgot that zsh's typing in folder name aliases to a directory change is a new feature :) <comment345057> @KisaAyano ;-) ! <comment345152> Sorry, I was already using `cd` in the alias command. I also verified that the path exists. I can actually do `cd ~/path/to/folder` inside Terminal and it correctly switches to that path. It's just that the alias command doesn't work. <comment345154> @EgeErsoz use `'` instead of `"` like in my answer! <comment345155> I tried that. Same error. :(
