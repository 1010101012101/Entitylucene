Issues reinstalling after an interrupted upgrade <body> I interrupted the upgrade to Sierra, which rendered my two year old Macbook Pro useless (kernel panic at boot, after entering password).  I rebooted with Command+R, and reformatted the main drive (attempting to install from there didn't work).  I could see my hard drive fine, but the installation failed due possibly to Internet connectivity issues.  I cleared NVRAM and rebooted, again with Command+R.  Now, the system will see my hard drive, but disk tools says it's "external" and "mounted read-only".  How can I get it to recognize my internal drive appropriately, so that I can install from the net?  <comment320280> Download the macOS Sierra installer on another computer and create a USB Installer.  Boot your Mac from the USB Installer and erase the Macintosh HD, then install macOS Sierra.
