rsync -E on Mac OS X, something I don't understand with ._ files <body> I'm working to replace Carbon Copy Cloner, that I've been using to backup my mac for years, with simple bash scripts using rsync.  A thing that I'm not understanding is the codersync -E/code option, that should preserve the HFS+ extended attributes. I know that, when the target disk is not formatted with HFS+, the attributes that can't fit are saved into a code._/code (AppleDouble) file. In fact, this is happening with my NAS which is a network drive, accessed by means of the SMB protocol. Fine.  But I'm seeing the code._/code files even when syncing to a USB disk, formatted with HFS+ over VeraCrypt. Why?  I'm running El Capitan, with the latest patches. Just as a reference, this is the set of rsync options I'm using:  precodersync --exclude _Archive \       --exclude-from &lt;...&gt;/macosx-excludes \       --delete \       --delete-before \       --progress \       --abHE \       --backup-dir "_Archive/2016-11-21 22-47-40" ... /code/pre  <comment328113> Is that Apple's supplied rsync ie what version are you using? <comment328256> When you say "HFS+ over VeraCrypt", do you mean there's an HFS+ volume inside the VeraCrypt container, or that the container file on an HFS+ volume? <comment328299> @Mark Yes, it's Apple's rsync. <comment328300> @Gordon The former: a HFS+ volume inside VeraCrypt. <comment328318> Reading VeraCrypt docd it seems the disk is NTFS but uses Fuse to allow OSX to access it. How are you seeing the ._ files? <comment328426> @Mark Yes, VeraCrypt uses Fuse below HFS+. For what concerns extended attributes, if I try ls -al@ on a directory on regular HFS+ and the same directory rsynced without -E to VeraCrypt, I see exactly the same extended attributes, without ._ files. Thus, it appears that they can be stored with no need of ._
