Why do I have to use sudo although I'm already a member of wheel? <body> I like to edit files in my code/Library/WebServer/Documents/code without having to run sudo all the time.  So I simply added my username codeabbood/code to the codewheel/code group using this command:  codesudo dseditgroup -o edit -a abbood -t user wheel/code  i verified that codeabbood/code is a member of codewheel/code like so:  precode$ members wheel abbood root /code/pre  If I run codels -l/code on my files in that directory.. the user is root and the group is wheel.  However as codeabbood/code I'm still required to sudo everytime I want to edit a file.. how come? how do I avoid that?  <answer268651> Answering based on system defaults (because of lack of the information in the question):  precode[~]# ls -ld /Library/WebServer/Documents drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  170 Feb 21  2016 /Library/WebServer/Documents/  [~]# ls -l /Library/WebServer/Documents total 72 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   3726 Feb 21  2016 PoweredByMacOSX.gif -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  31958 Feb 21  2016 PoweredByMacOSXLarge.gif -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel     45 Jun 12  2007 index.html.en /code/pre  Members of group codewheel/code do not have write permissions to the code/Library/WebServer/Documents/code directory nor the files inside.  Hence adding any account to the group codewheel/code will not allow this account to write files in/to the above directory.  <comment337351> What do you mean by "you are required"? And what are the permissions? <comment337352> ie i cannot edit files inside that directory unless if i do `sudo vi index.html`, it won't allow me if I just do `vi index.html` <comment337353> How is anyone supposed to know when you show no permissions? And what do you mean by "won't allow"? Siri says "you are required to sudo"?
