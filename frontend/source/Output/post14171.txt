Sips not working with pict, qtif and sgi files <body> The terminal command codesips -s format pict /path/to/image.ext --out /path/to/output.pic/code ouputs codeError: Unsupported output format com.apple.pict/code even though if you do codeman sips/code and go down to format, there is written that it supports codejpeg | tiff | png | gif | jp2 | pict | bmp | qtif | psd | sgi | tga/code.  Is this normal and can you fix it anyway?  <comment140149> Interesting, same here.
