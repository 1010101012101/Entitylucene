Make a "Loved" or favorite podcasts playlist? <body> I really have been trying to find a way to save my favorite podcast episodes from different channels into one playlist. With the new Love button in iTunes, I made a Smart Playlist using this feature. But no luck  iTunes wasn't updating the Smart Playlist with any podcasts that I marked as Loved. Any ideas? Maybe this functionality isn't possible with iTunes? If so, that's a shame...

There was an update for iTunes recently (12.2.1), maybe I'll try again. <comment234373> @jaminroe Maybe live updating is off? <comment234376> So I made the playlist again. Before I had the order of the rules like my screenshot above. I switched them around like yours, and its working now! Either that fixed it, or the iTunes update did. Thanks! <comment234387> Unfortunately it doesn't sync to iOS. Not sure why :( Maybe a bug?

In iTunes on Mac or Music in iOS? My podcasts work fine in my Podcasts app on iOS. <comment234512> @jaminroe I don't use podcasts but my best guess would be is that you can't greate playlists of podcasts on iOS <comment234513> Nope, playlists should be under my stations. [info](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5321443?tstart=0) <comment234533> Unfortunately, Stations are only to filter podcast stations and new episodes, etc.. You can't save specific episodes in a Station. :( So maybe something they will do someday. Thanks though!
