How can I force specific HiDPI modes? <body> I have a 13" MBP (Early 2011) plugged it to a Dell U2711 monitor via DisplayPort.  I have successfully enabled HiDPI mode, using Quartz Debug the problem is that the screen won't run at the HiDPI equivalent of the screen's native resolution. i.e 1440x720 HiDPI (2560x1440). The screen's maximum resolution of 2560x1440 strongis/strong recognised &amp; working.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kUhoE.png" alt="Native resolution detected &amp; working"  The best it will do is 960x720HiDPI (1920x1440), which seems strange as most of the documentation suggests HiDPI will only work at pixel doubling resolutions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zjn1o.png" alt="Missing specific HiDPI mode"  Is it possible to force the MBP to run the display at 1440x720 HiDPI on a screen that supports 2560x1440 native pixel resolution?  <answer59263> After a lot of messing about I managed to get this working in two ways.  ol liThe first is by using the Retina Display Manager I found on reddit. This gives a menu with all the available display modes, strongbut/strong try the second method first.br Screenshot 1 (Warning, large file)/li liThe second I found after using Retina Display Manager, to my surprise the strongDisplays/strong pane in strongSystem Preferences/strong was reporting it was running in 720p mode.br This mode is strongactually/strong 1280x720 HiDPI (2560x1440).br Screenshot 2 (Warning, large file)/li /ol  Yay!  I was going to embed screenshots of these new menus, but they are now insanely huge due to HiDPI mode, so I just linked to them instead.  <comment260218> is this still working for you on yosemeti/el-capitan? I have the same monitor you do, and I can't get hidpi to work. Choosing 720p like you did gets me actual 720p. <comment347565> On El Capitan (or at all), I cannot reach HiDPI 1280x720... - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/276205/1280x720-hidpi-resolution-for-2560x1440-monitor
