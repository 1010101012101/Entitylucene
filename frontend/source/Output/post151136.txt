Why is Time Machine only using 20% of its partition allocation <body> rMBP Late '13, running Mavericks, 128GB SSD.  I have a 1TB drive, partitioned equally via Disk Utility to two drives. One is used by Time Machine, the other by Copy Carbon Cloner. I think my concern is expressed well with this image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ayUEt.png" alt="enter image description here"  It doesn't make sense, does it?   I've been doing weekly backups with time Machine for almost a year now. Except for setting up this partition as the TM designated drive in System Preferences, I didn't mess around with any of its settings.  <comment177824> If you check Options in Time Machine Preferences there is nothing in there? <comment177829> You mean exclusions? Yes I'm excluding my Movie directory (which is between 10-40GB at varying times) <comment177932> If you browse through the Time Machine backups can you see what is missing?
