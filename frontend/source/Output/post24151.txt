Is there a way to make the alarm clock much much louder? <body> I'm trying to treat my iPhone as an alarm clock. But, strongit's not working/strong. I'm not a light sleeper and the iPhone "alarm clock" does not have that kind of explosive power my traditional alarm clock has.   Is there a way to make the alarm clock much much louder?   <answer24152> There is not much you can do with the built in speakers of the iPhone. My biggest suggestion would be using external speakers connected through an auxiliary cable or something similar.   <answer24161> I would suggest that you strongtry a few alert tones/strong to see if any of them give you better performance. Volume dynamics vary from alert to alert. By going into the click app and tapping Alarm  Edit and selecting any alarm you will see the settings that you can change. One of the settings you can change for a given alarm is Sound. Tap this option to select the tone you would like to use.  One tone you might find more to your liking is the one titled "Alarm" â€” this tone is much more "explosive" than the standard "Marimba tone.  You could also strongtry recording your own tones in GarageBand/strong. GarageBand has a project type for iPhone Ringtones. When you create your own ringtone you have much more control over the specifics of the ringtone and can even do things to increase the gain on the tone itself.  Of course none of these tips will do anything to increase the actual power of the built in speakers (which are necessarily small). One thing you could do to help in that regard is to strongthink carefully about where you place your phone/strong. Placing your phone in a glass cup at night (while a bit dangerous in the morning when you go groping for it) can increase the volume significantly.  Hope that helps.  <answer86121> Yes you can increase the volume. Go to settings, then sounds the look for ringer and alerts. Slide the bar to increase or decrease volume. If you have an iPhone this will also increase the volume of your ringtone.   <answer86126> Why yes - there is an accessory for just that purpose.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M4Fog.jpg" alt="analog tele-phonographers"  Several musical instrument recyclers/artists - notably Christopher Locke - make and sell a selection of iPhone, iPad and other amplifiers that will make your iOS alarm clock much louder.  <answer141509> ol liGo to Clock/li liGo to Alarm/li liEdit/Create Alarm/li liGo to Sound/li liSelect Sound/li liTurn up volume with side up button while sound is playing/li liBAM!/li /ol  <answer141511> You could try...  ol liPlugging in some speakers or connecting a bluetooth speaker/li liPutting your phone in a container (like a Tupperware or a bowl) to focus the sound/li liTurning up your ringer volume all the way/li /ol  You could also try downloading one of the following apps:  ul liLoud Alarm Clock FREE/li liAlarm Clock Free for iOS 8/li liSpinMe Alarm Clock - Guaranteed Wake Up for Deep Sleepers/li /ul  <comment99363> This doesn't adequately answer the question. Probably in this case, the answer is "No" -- unless the iPhone user connects their phone to an external speaker <comment217667> Just be careful that the external speakers to not go to sleep during the night if using this method.
