How do I properly force osx to reload the Info.plist file of an application? <body> On Yosemite 10.10, I was trying to use codedefaults/code to modify the codeInfo.plist/code file of an app, but after such command, osx does not reload modified codeInfo.plist/code.  I've tried to move the app around and reboot, as mentioned somewhere else as a way to force osx to reload codeInfo.plist/code, but failed.  So here's the problem, strongHow do I force osx to reload the codeInfo.plist/code file of an app?/strong  hr  Specifically here is what I want to achieve:  Currently the flash in Firefox runs in low resolution when in fullscreen mode, to fix this I need to make the codeFirefox.app/Contents/MacOS/plugin-container.app/code HiDPI compatible.  According to this, after this command:  codedefaults write /Application/Firefox/Contents/MacOS/plugin-container.app/Contents/Info.plist  NSHighResolutionCapable true/code  I should be able to uncheck the "Open in Low Resolution" checkbox. But no, modifed codeplugin-container.app/code still has a greyed-out checkbox in its info panel. Rebooting does not solve the problem.  Here's the weird part: I moved the modified codeplugin-container.app/code to somewhere else, then I was able to uncheck that checkbox. But I moved it back and that checkbox became greyed-out again.  An work-around I found is  ul licopy another app to code/Application/Firefox/Contents/MacOS//code and renamed it to codeplugin-container.app/code (I call this the "fake codeplugin-container.app/code"), /li lithen replace fake one with the modified one./li /ul  In this way I can have the "Open in Low Resolution" checkbox back and am able to uncheck it, strongbut system doesn't update the app icon after replacing/strong, so now the app icon of the modified codeplugin-container.app/code is still the one of the fake codeplugin-container.app/code.  A problem is fixed but another is created.  So what is the proper way to have the system reload the codeInfo.plist/code?  <answer205759> I've just had this issue as we had to change codeInfo.plist/code in our app and it failed to run for anyone who updated from the previous version of the app. The easiest way I found of clearing the codeInfo.plist/code cache was simply to move the file to a different directory, then move it back. I'm still hoping to find a way of doing it pro grammatically, but this should do for your case.  <comment189491> You need to clear the cache folder. <comment189521> Maybe LaunchServices should be rebuilt? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125402/icons-remains-the-same-after-i-have-changed-the-default-program-for-opening-the/126526#126526 <comment189527> @Buscar웃 I can locate the cache folder at `~/Library/Caches/` but not sure which folder is responsible for plist file caching. <comment189529> @MateuszSzlosek That fixed the icon glitch, thanks. But the main problem is not affected by a rebuild. <comment189643> What made you believe that by modifying the Info.plist will change to HiDPI mode? <comment189707> @Buscar웃 I've been doing this to many apps since Mavericks and, as I mentioned in my question, according to this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69038/open-in-low-resolution-checkbox-on-retina-macbook-pro-checked-and-disabled
