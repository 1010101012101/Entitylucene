Macbook air 13 2013 in battery drain issue <body> This is the second time that battery is causing issue. Initially after I bought I gave it to apple service and they reinstalled OS and suggested VirtualBox was causing the drain so I did not install it next time around.   Now I installed Intel HAXM and battery again fell back to 3-4 hours. I have removed Intel HAXM and still the battery is giving 3-4 hours.  Activity manager does not show a rogue process, most processes are under 1%.  Can you help me detect why the battery is being drained or how to find the cause?   EDIT looks like https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/6301/53842 might have a clue. I did not check on strongAll processes/strong in emactivity Monitor filter/em. It was      parentalcontrolsd   taking more than 80% CPU. Now the battery is slowly coming back to show more time.  Question part 1 Are virtualization software generally drain life on mac? Or is there an alternative?  Question part 2 If parental control service is causing drain then how do we use parental control feature without draining battery? Many other posts suggest to delete and restart and then use it again.  <answer101486> Using the OEM tools like Apple Activity monitor could tell you who is using the juice.  Open Activity monitor located in your utility folder.  Select CPU  Select All processes  Select %CPU to sort by usage  If any process is using 70% (for longer then few seconds) it is the one draining your battery.  <comment119552> I was doing that that but "All processes" is not selected by default. Instead "My Processes" is and that was showing processess around 0% CPU. thx
