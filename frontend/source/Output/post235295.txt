Remapping a keyboard key only when using a specific input language <body> I currently have 2 input languages on my Mac: U.S., and Hebrew - PC.  The Hebrew - PC is almost the same as it should actually be, except the tilde key (kbd`/kbd) should actually type a semicolon (kbd;/kbd), but instead it creates a backslash (kbd\/kbd). I already have a designated backslash key, and in order to type a semicolon I actually need to hit kbdAlt/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd:/kbd which is extremely cumbersome.  I'd like to reassign this key to work properly, but only when using the Hebrew layout - the English one needs to keep its use as the tilde which I use for window switching and terminal home dir.  What are my options? I currently have copies of BetterTouchTool and Karabiner, if that helps.  <comment287863> Another option is Ukelele, which provides a simple interface to make a custom layout like you want in a couple minutes I think. <comment287955> Just tried it out, looks like it will be global though, not limited by input language <comment287961> I don't understand what you mean.  You make a custom hebrew pc keyboard layout and use it to type Hebrew.  When you type English, I assume you would use the independent US layout, which has not been modified.
