Is it possible to arrange the order of movies in iTunes? <body> See the two images below:  img src="https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-16921359-58911/450-156/Screen+Shot+2011-12-04+at+11.37.25+PM.png" alt=""  img src="https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-16921359-58912/450-187/Screen+Shot+2011-12-04+at+11.37.18+PM.png" alt=""  Is there a way (with meta data somehow) to arrange the movies so they show in the order of their sequal (example: X-Men, X2, Last Stand), instead of arranging them alphabetically by title?  <answer39674> Unfortunately, I don't have enough videos to test this.  Using emThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring/em for example:  Open the movie's strongGet Info/strong:br Go to the strongVideo/strong tab and set, for example:     Show: strongThe Lord of the Rings/strongbr   Episode Number: strong1/strong   Go to the strongSorting/strong tab and set:     Name: strongThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring/strongbr   Sort Name: strongLord of the Rings/strong     <comment44855> This would have been my answer if I got here first, my only addition would be to avoid use of "the" in sort names, as iTunes will generally remove them and you may as well keep consistent. <comment44925> @stuffe, thanks for the confirmation!  I've edited in your suggestions. <comment265649> You could also ignore episode/show and simply set the sort name to "Lord of the Rings 1".
