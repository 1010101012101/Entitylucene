Can not restore my iPhone 5 because of restriction passcode <body> I was half asleep when I put a restriction passcode on for my child to play on it.   I went to restore it so I have to turn off "find my phone " but I can't because of the restrictions. How can I solve this?  <answer227604>    The short answer is no.      The long answer is wipe the device and then start over. If you have a backup, hopefully it's from before the restrictions were set.   hr  Quote from Martin Marconcini's answer on the possible duplicate post as mentioned in the comments.  <answer234683> You can refer to this Github project to recover restrictions passcode from an unencrypted backup. https://github.com/gwatts/pinfinder/blob/master/README.md  <comment277438> possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4185/i-forgot-the-passcode-for-my-ipad-restrictions-how-can-i-disable-them . It is for the iPad, but I think the same applies
