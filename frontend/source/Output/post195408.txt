Unable to delete file from Downloads folder <body> I have a file (4alJRTP_.gif.part) in my downloads folder that won't seem to delete.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/oKfnQ9X.png" alt="img0"  Every time I drag it to the trash, nothing shows up in the trash and the file icon remains in the downloads folder.  I also tried opening the file and a pop-up window shows up saying "'file_name.gif.part' can't be found".  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Am9zf8e.png" alt="img1"  How can I get rid of the file icon in my downloads folder? Any help will be greatly appreciated!  <answer195455> The method may depend on how comfortable you are using Terminal…  ol liUse the Terminal command codesudo rm -R/code followed by the path to the stuck file, which you can easily get by dragging it into terminal after typing the command, or/li liTry Trash It!

That warning out of the way, here is how you can do it.  ol liFirst open codeTerminal/code (in /Applications/Utilities). /li liType codecd ~/Downloads/code and press codeReturn/code./li liThen type codesudo srm -f/code followed by a codeSpace/code (don’t leave out the spacel). emTry this first if it doesn't work then use codesudo srm -Rf/code which is the recursive form of this command/em/li listrongDon’t press codeReturn/code yet./strong/li liNext, in codeFinder/code open a window displaying the contents of the codeDownloads/code folder./li liSelect strongONLY/strong the files in that window that you want deleted and drag them into the Terminal window; emthis adds the paths of all the files to the coderm/code(remove) command./em /li liNow, press codeReturn/code /li liEnter your administrator password when prompted/li /ol  In a moment or two the files should be gone.

These are powerful tools, and StrongWith Great Power Comes Great Responsibility/Strong.   h2Update/h2  The file that you are looking to delete, the one that says code*.part/code is a file extension indicating that a file was downloaded partially.  This likely occured when Firefox, Skype, or another app able to download from the internet stopped a download mid-download.   Take a look Downloads on your browser, codecommand-J/code on strongFirefox/strong, codeshift-command-J/code on strongChrome/strong, and codealt-command-L/code in strongSafari/strong, and see if any of the files there has a partial download. You should be able to cancel the download there and then that file should clear up, or stop reappearing after you download it.  -- The answer I provided is based on the technique that I obtained from Joe Kissell's article on MacWorld and have used during the times I have not been able to empty my trash bin.  <answer195837> Have you tried to 'Secure Empty Trash'?  In Finder-menu you have an option 'Secure Empty Trash' or hold codeCMD/code and right-click on the trash. You will get a popup allowing to 'Secure Empty Trash'  <comment233342> Can you open Terminal, type `ls -aBl`, drag the file/icon into the terminal window and press enter? Then please take a screenshot of the command and the result and add it to your question. <comment233347> +1 for Spider Man reference. `sudo` should use that quote.
