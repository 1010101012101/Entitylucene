iOS 10 tap home to use <body> I dislike pressing the home button.  How can I make it so that a tap equals a press? I have it for unlocking the phone (iPhone SE) so it should be possible elsewhere too.   <answer285123> Open settings and navigate to  Settings  General  Accessibility  Home Button  Toggle "Rest Finger to Open".  hr  For every other situation it is not possible to perform Home Button actions without pressing it.  Please let me know if this answers your question.  <comment359536> Thank you. It's a pity that it does not work elsewhere.
