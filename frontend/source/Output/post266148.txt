Install MacOS 10.12.2 on VMWare Fusion 8.5.3 <body> I have a MacBook Pro running MacOS 10.12.2. It has VMWare Fusion 8.5.3. I have downloaded codeInstall macOS Sierra/code into the /Applications folder.  How do I install macOS 10.12.2 into VMWare Fusion.  I tried Google but there are so many references to overcoming issues with the beta versions of Sierra that I cannot find instructions that look as simple as this should be.  I tried the normal way of creating a new image in Fusion, but I get an error about choosing a startup disk.  ol liFile-New .../li liCreate a custom virtual machine/li liMacOS 10.12/li liCreate a new virtual disk/li liFinish/li liObserve that it boots to blue screen and gives error about choosing startup disk./li /ol  <answer266151> The description here: https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2056603 is still valid - which also has a small video of the installation process.  ol liSelect File  New from the Fusion menu bar./li liSelect "Install from disc or image" and Click Continue./li liDrag and drop the Install MacOS Sierra application into Use operating system installation disc or image dialog box./li liClick Continue./li liFusion should automatically discover the Guest Operating System. If not, ensure that the Operating System is set to Apple Mac OS X and that the version is set to Mac OS X 10.12.x. Click Continue./li liIf you want to modify any of the settings, such as memory (RAM), CPU, or hard disk size, click Customize Settings and specify the non-default values./li liClick Finish. The installation starts./li liWhen prompted, select Reinstall Mac OS X and click Continue./li liClick Continue./li liAgree to the license agreement and follow the prompts to begin the  installation./li /ol  <answer266165> Another easy way to create a Sierra virtual machine with VMware Fusion 8 is to use the Recovery Partition as the source.  ol liFile - New/li liClick on "Install OS X from the Recovery Partition" /li liSave the virtual disk image./li liClick Finish to create the VM./li /ol  Hope this helps!  <comment333743> Ignoring that these instructions are for Mavericks and not for Sierra, I gave them a try.  They fail at step 5: "Unable to create the installation medium". <comment333744> Did you ensure that is was the correct OS params for Sierra ?? <comment333745> I clicked continue.  I googled a bit and there was a suggestion to reboot.  That worked.  it is installing now.  As soon as the install is successful I will accept your answer.  I hate rebooting as a means to solve a problem on a mac; but it worked. <comment333747> I was fooled by the VMWare UI.  I did not notice the "Install from disk or image" option on the UI because it is not in the list of alternative options.  It is just one big button.  I took the alternative options as the complete set of options. <comment348469> This is the correct answer, thank you very much :D
