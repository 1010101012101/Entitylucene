Mail client sending duplicate replies <body> I have my OS X Mail client setup with one GMail and one Outlook account. They both use IMAP.   I have an issue that every time I reply to a message I send two identical replies (from the same hotmail address to the same recipient). This only happens when I reply with my hotmail address, writing a new message works as it is supposed to.  Mail version 8.0 (1990.1) and OS X 10.10.  I saw a previous poster had a similar issue but the problem solved itself in his/her case. Anyone got advice on how to fix this?   Regards  Edit: Here is the mail setup img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SFtjT.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vrUVN.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YNr6O.png" alt=""  <answer156592> OK, the only settings i found that might cause that is in the Outlook web client.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAfdk.jpg" alt="outlook"  Try setting it to as shown in pic above.  I assume the IMAP sync is doing something it should not.  But you can try resenting the outgoing server for outlook in Mail app.  type      smtp.live.com   Use this Apple tool to double check your email settings.  <answer237018> You are most likely not sending each message twice, but saving two copies of it in your strongSent/strong folder.  Uncheck emStore sent messages on the server/em under strongMailbox Behaviors/strong.  Your SMTP server automatically saves a copy of each outgoing message in your strongSent/strong folder. No need for strongMail/strong to duplicate that effort.  <answer244594> Go to strongMail/strong - strongPreferences/strong - strongViewing/strong and un-tick "Include related messages" in the strongView conversations/strong section.  <comment183880> Could you help us by showing/telling your settings in the email for the server to be used for hotmail under Mail Preferences Account. I have a smtp.live.com there for my hotmail. <comment184111> Added to my post <comment184115> Thank you :) just to test, if you use the online outlook mail (not Apple Mail) and reply does it work. Reply to a sender from gmail or outlook? <comment184118> It works fine with GMail, both web client and Mail. Outlook web client (and local Mac version) works fine as well. <comment184139> Sadly it did not work. I did also try tweaking the server settings and turning off saving sent messages on server as well. I will try to remove all mail accounts and add them again. <comment195568> @Magnus did you solve the issue? <comment260551> What is your outlook SMTP configuration? <comment349854> This is probably the correct answer. I noticed this with Gmail a while back. Googleâ€™s SMTP server automatically saves outgoing messages to your Sent folder. Having **Mail** do the same will result in duplicates. I bet this behavior applies to Hotmail.
