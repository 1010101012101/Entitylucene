How to use AppleScript in a bash script to create an alias for an app? <body> I need to create an alias on my Desktop to an app in my Applications folder, using a bash script file.  As far as I know, it's only possible with AppleScript. Unfortunately, my AppleScript skills are non-existent.  I couldn't find a good emworking/em example on how to create an alias on my Desktop.  1) How do I create an alias on my Desktop using AppleScript?  2) How do I insert this AppleScript into my bash script file so that it could work in Terminal?  <answer278127> codeosascript/code will run AppleScript code in your shell. This example uses a HEREDOC to present the code to codeosascript/code.  precode/usr/bin/osascript &lt;&lt;'EOF' tell application "Finder"     set myapp to POSIX file "/Applications/Chess.app" as alias     make new alias to myapp at Desktop     set name of result to "Chess.app" end tell EOF /code/pre  Source- Link  <answer278128> Why not skip the Applescript and just create a strongsymbolic link/strong in bash?  It behaves exactly like an alias on the desktop except now you can work with it in bash.    See this answer for a breakdown of aliases, hard links and sym links.  So, your command would be:  codeln -s /path/to/application/MyApp.app /Users/username/Desktop/MyApp/code  Where MyApp.app and username is the name of the application and the user respectively.  <comment350060> Did Apple not release a new version of that AppleScript editor which would observe your actions and make AppleScripts for you?  Even if you needed to tweak them afterwards, such a thing was helpful for me when I was first learning AppleScript in the OS 7 era.
