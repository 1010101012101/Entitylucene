bzip2 compression library not found error <body> I get bzip2 compression libraryâ€¦ no error when trying to install some software on a mac running osx 10.12. Some googling revealed that the headers for bzip2 should be there for the installer to recognize bzip2 and this could be achieved by installing the dev package. However, couldn't find one for osx. For example for Fedora this is bzip2-devel.  <answer257639> By default header files aren't installed to code/usr/include/code.  If you run codexcode-select install/code in a Terminal window this will install the Xcode command line tools and also populate the code/usr/include/code folder with a bunch of header files including codebzlib.h/code.  This might be what you're looking for.  <comment321809> Can you tell us what it is that you're trying to install? Might make it easier for us to help.
