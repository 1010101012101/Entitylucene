I have a Safari publicity issue? <body> I downloaded an app for "watching FREE online tv shows" and obviously the app didn't worked, so I uninstall this app and now every time I click on any link in safari (most of the times in youtube) i get a new tab with publicity.  Im really worried about this because its something new for me, I can't find a solution, I installed an ad block from safari extensions and restored safari and nothing works.  Please help me!  Thanks.  PS. If you need screenshots, log indo or something let me know.   <answer148114> You've downloaded adware and possibly malware onto your computer. You'll need to remove it.
