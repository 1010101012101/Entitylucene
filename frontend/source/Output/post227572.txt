Ð¡heck for duplicate photos on Apple devices <body> Here's the thing, I have iPhone, iPad and Mac. On each device there is a bunch of photo copies. Is it possible to find and delete photos from my iOS devices that are on my Mac?  <answer228979> Try interPhotos app. It may work for you. But you have to download both versions for Mac and iOS  <comment279577> Thanks! It solved problem partly!
