Restarting sound service? <body> My macbook pro running Snow Leopard stopped making sounds a couple hours ago. I've found other reports of people with sounds working through headphones, but that's not the problem I'm seeing. I get no sound when my headphones are plugged in either.  I'm wondering if there's a LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon to restart which would remedy this. I've already tried killing the coreaudio daemon (and it dutifully automatically restarted) but that didn't fix it.  I need to reboot for an OS update, so I think that'll probably rectify things.   Is there another way?  <answer52721> In my experience, a reboot is required to fix this. It's a poor fix since it seems to recover from the failure and not address the root cause. I would like to have, but have not yet discovered if there is another quicker/simpler method to get sound back...  <answer64024> You can kill the CoreAudio process by opening Terminal and running codesudo kill -9 code`ps ax|grep 'coreaudio[a-z]' | awk '{print $1}'/code`/code. It will restart automatically after a couple seconds.  That fixes some problems my aging MBP has been having, where it sometimes fails to detect headphones or decides the speakers aren't connected. No guarantees it will work for every audio problem, but it's worth a shot.

Since there are two answers, I wanted to document my findings:  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext  sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext /code/pre  These two commands will unload then reload the audio kernel extension. This post fixes my problem 100% of the time, So please upvote that original post  This solution did not work for me:  precodesudo kill -9 `ps ax|grep 'coreaudio[a-z]' | awk '{print $1}'` /code/pre  It shuts down the internal speakers and sends the sound to my 27" monitor but does not bring back the sound to my internal speakers or headset. Perhaps in some cases it works, but hopefully this post might explain when to use one solution vs the other.  <comment18393> Sound came back after a reboot. <comment63597> I'm fairly new here but can ask a question that might help. Have you have recently updated to 10.6.8? Many users are reporting audio issues as well as problems with networking and printing after updating to 10.6.8. You may need Apple to issue a patch or you could try some of the interim solutions people are suggesting for these 10.6.8 issues. <comment63598> When this happened, I was on 10.6.7. After I restarted, I'm now on 10.6.8. <comment63599> @Doug I wonder if there was an update that installed after you rebooted.... <comment63600> No, just rebooted without any system updates <comment99478> Just happened to me again. Newer laptop running 10.8.3. Shutting the lid, waiting 20 seconds and then opening again fixed it. <comment103407> Thanks this helped! I just had to kill the core audio service. It restarted after a few seconds. <comment107691> Worked for me. Thanks very much. <comment143198> Nice, worked for me on Mavericks. <comment147978> Apple High Definition Audio kext? Neat, I would not have figured that acronym without this context. <comment204608> 3 This also works on Mavericks!! :))) <comment229649> Worked on Yosemite too! Thanks a lot :) <comment265053> Just crashed my comuter (OSX El Capitan)... I would not recommend it, though I guess it worked after restart :-p <comment280846> `sudo pkill coreaudiod` <comment314308> Just adding, for future reference, I just rebooted on 10.11.6, after a small update (no version number increase), and there was a lag between events and sounds and between video and sounds.  While the line above gave me an error about killing the wrong PID, I used grep on the ps command, got the PID for the coreaudio process, killed it using sudo kill -9 and it worked perfectly.  Audio restarted and the lag was gone. <comment327008> This crashes my macOS Sierra 10.12.1. I do not recommend using this fix. <comment344963> Works on my old iMac (Snow Leopard) when it fails to recognize my USB sound card. Previously a reboot was needed to fix this, so neat!
