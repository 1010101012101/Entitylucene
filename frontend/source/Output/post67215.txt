How to get subtitles on AppleTV via AirPlay from iTunes on a Mac? <body> I'm pretty sure this used to work... I can play a movie in iTunes on my Mac. When played on "My computer" I get the little speech bubble icon and can choose to have subtitles or not. But when I choose Airplay, the bubble icon disappears and no subtitle appears on the screen. I tried holding down the middle button on the remote but no subtitle options appear on the AppleTV either. What am I missing?
