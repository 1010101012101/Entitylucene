How to make Siri available when I open my MacBook? <body> When I open my laptop, I can click on Chrome exe and launch the browser.  I know I can ask Siri to open Chrome, but I have to click to the Siri icon (or the keyboard shortcut) and then ask her to, which - well - is more work than just clicking Chrome. It will open Chrome and terminate.  Can I make Siri be available at startup? Open Chrome when she asked to and then terminate.  <answer257757> I think you can't. But, if what you want is just to open Chrome at login, just left-clic the Chrome icon in the dock, then Options  open at login  <comment321986> Yeah I thought about that, but I was thinking about something general, like open chrome, open last viewed file, etc, but I agree!
