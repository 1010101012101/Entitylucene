Connect to external drive wirelessly, securely and easily <body> I'm moving from using a laptop as my sole computer (MBP, early 2011) to having two active computers (the MBP and an iMac). Instead of keeping all my data on my MBP, I'd like it all on an external drive that:  ol liI can access wirelessly in my home, or connect to directly (e.g., for fast speeds when video editing)/li liThat preferably takes advantage of my current external drive (a pair of 3 TB drives in a RAID enclosure)/li liThat I could login to from anywhere with Wifi (optional, but would be handy)/li liIs very secure and private/li liIs very straightforward and fast to setup and maintain/li liCheap (a few hundred max)/li /ol  So far, I've considered a NAS, a Mac mini as server, or even just turning on the file sharing options in OS X (e.g., "Back to my Mac"). Any thoughts or ideas on these or other solutions would be terrific.
