One cinema display with two macs <body> Is there a way to connect two macs to a single cinema display? Of course I won't use them at the same time, but I want them to be connected to the display.  <answer185975> At work, we refer to such devices as "switch boxes," though it appears that "video switch mini displayport" pulls up what you're looking for. The following appears to be what you're looking for:  4-port DualView Mini DisplayPort KVMP Switch with Peripheral Sharing  Of course, you're just interested in sharing the display, but it does have a built-in USB hub, in case that's needed. It has a good desktop footprint, as well.  <comment219486> Thanks! I used them in the good old times of CRT monitors, and they are expensive as I remember them! :D
