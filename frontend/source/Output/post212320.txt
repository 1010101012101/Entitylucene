I would choose that one, it is the one marked with the precise date. Note: auto backups (sync) are overwriting the earlier one.  <comment256477> Notice the Folder marked 1:30 AM {made by me} vs 4:30 AM. On disk they show different timings, but in iTunes its a "new name that includes 4:00 am" but time stamped for same time: 1:30 am. Funky.   I will post back more once I dissect `info.plist` comparison. <comment257062> The second time I did a restore from the same backup it created another copy. 3rd time I did it it created another. What is wrong with iTunes?
