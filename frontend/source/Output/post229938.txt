El Capitan Mission Control: How to select an app with the keyboard? <body> I've looked high and low but can't find a keyboard shortcut to select an app from Mission Control.  I want to press F3, then "some keyboard key(s) and not have to click on the trackpad" to select the app I want.  <answer230122> The best alternative solution:  Press command-space to open spotlight, then start typing the title of the app (or whatever) you want and press enter.  <answer230125> There is free app called Karabiner that allows you to completely customize your keyboard short cuts on OS X including assigning "Launcher" keys combinations to launch apps.  Full disclaimer:  I have used Karabiner, but I prefer to just use Spotlight (kbdCmd/kbd+kbdSpacebar/kbd) to find the app I am looking for; much less to remember.  <comment280848> Seems there's no way to do this. Hopefully Apple will add this feature in the future. <comment280901> I'm using BTT (BetterTouchTool) to add gesture features to the trackpad and it also allows for custom keyboard short cut assignment. If you haven't checked out BTT, give it a whirl. It has a 45 day trail and I have a feeling I'll be fully dependent on it by then ... ;-)
