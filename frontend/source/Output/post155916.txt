Screen turns pink all of a sudden while working on Macbook Air <body> What can I do to fix my macbook air running mavericks, all of a sudden its screen turns pink or another color like turquoise and becomes unresponsive, about once a month...  <comment183404> is it under warranty ? does it do that if you run in safe mode? when that happens get the console log for the time stamp of the occurrence. did you run the Apple Hardware test ?
