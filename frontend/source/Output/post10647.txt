How can I tell when Turbo Boost is active on my MacBook? <body> I have one of the core i7 MacBooks, and I'm wondering if there is a way to see when Turbo Boost is active (other than the fact that the laptop gets really hot and the fan kicks on).   I use iStat to monitor CPU activity, but that doesn't show Turbo Boost activity.  <answer11171> there's 2 utilities that could provide that info,  ul lione from Intel called strongMacCPUID/strong (http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-maccpuid/)/li liother called strongCPU-X/strong (http://netkas.org/?p=72) rather outdated/li /ul  Hope this helps.

With this code I am getting ~ 10.22Gflops from a single core using SSE (peak would be 11.6Gflops at 2.9GHz)  <comment88358> The MacCPUID *always* shows that my CPU is clocked at 2.3 GHZ. But in fact it should change from time to time and go from 1.8GHZ-2.8GHz. Not really helpful. <comment115063> On my Mid 2010 iMac with a core i7 the installer balks, saying "Intel® Power Gadget only supports 2nd generation Intel® Core™ processors and later." <comment166971> I always think of KITT and Michael Knight when I read 'Turbo boost' - http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t165/andygarand/kp13.jpg <comment213190> ver 3 downloaded from here worked find on my Macbook Pro Retina 2015 https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget-20
