Command+S No Longer Works on a Particular App (Dreamweaver) <body> For some reasons, I haven't been able to save (Command+S or "File  Save") in Dreamweaver CS starting today. "Save As" works normally; and, if I set a different shortcut combination to save, e.g. Command+Control+S, it works OK.  I had made sure that the files that I was working on were writable. I also tried Command+S on Photoshop and it worked fine.  My guess is there is another application that "hijacks" that particular shortcut in Dreamweaver. If this is possible, is there a way to find out what shortcuts are "owned" by what application?  My next guess is my Dreamweaver is simply corrupted. I'd hate to reinstall it; any opinions on how to make sure that a particular app is "corrupted"?  Thanks beforehand.  <comment19064> When I did Command+S, the "File" label on the menu bar actually lit up for a sec, indicating that Dreamweaver received the command; however, no saving was done. <comment19065> "Save All" and its shortcut Command+Control+S works just fine. <comment19066> Have you tried rebooting? <comment19090> Yes, I had rebooted my machine a few times now. <comment19119> Could you give us a list of your extensions/plugins? <comment19751> I finally reinstalled the Dreamweaver; it fixed the problem. Thanks guys!
