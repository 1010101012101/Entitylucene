Mac Finder: Getting the path of a directory or file as as string <body> In Windows it is possible to right-click on a file. Then select "properties". In "properties" the file-system path is shown. Can then be copied by marking and storing (into the clipboard).  I couldn't figure out a way to do that in Mac.   Therefore my question:  Can I retrieve the file-system path of a directory or file via the GUI of the Mac Finder?  <answer252172> I don't see a way to do it with just Finder. The best I could do is:  ol liOpen a Terminal window./li liDrag the file you want into terminal./li liSelect the filename in the terminal window./li liCopy the filename to the clipboard./li /ol  Safari will also work. It's a file URL, so you will have to be careful with your selection.  <answer252179> kbdCtrl/kbd-click (or two finger click) on the file you want the path from, then press kbdOpt/kbd and select "Copy as path name" (or what it's called in english) from the context menu.  You can also just select the file and then press kbdOpt-Cmd-C/kbd to copy the pathname to the clipboard.  <comment313721> Wow, I had no idea! <comment313730> \*ding\* That was the sound of an old dog learning a new trick. <comment313736> This does not work with versions of OS X prior to OS X 10.11. <comment313742> You can also drag the file into a TextEdit window (in plain text mode)â€¦ that might be less dangerous. <comment313831> Yep. No idea. :)) Lovely. Thanks a lot. <comment313834> Haven't know that Drag and Drop ability of Mac OS. Thanks a lot. Your answer was definitely helpful for me too.
