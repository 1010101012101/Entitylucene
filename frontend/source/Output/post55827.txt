Is picture location info retained when I share a photo? <body> When I send a picture to a friend (e.g. via Messages, Mail, or Tweet), is the location information in that photo preserved? In other words, can they see where I took that photo?  What about when I use 3rd party apps such as Facebook?  <answer55843> h2Yes./h2  This is a feature usually only offered by professional photo software. Removing metadata (like codeEXIF/code or codeGPS/code) requires an additional step by the one that wants to share his/her photograph.  Aperture for example offers to export picture as either an strongoriginal/strong or a strongversion/strong. When you choose to export a strongversion/strong the  meta- and gps-data is removed from the original.  I know from experience that sharing via the following options does not remove these and from pictures:  ul liMail for OS X/li liTweetdeck for OS X/li liUploading via a web browser/li /ul  Here's what the metadata of an emexport as original/em look like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PxE53.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DZAH1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's what the metadata of an emexport as version/em by Aperture look like. This is an exported version of the same original. The data will differ depending on the export options for a version.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8lBky.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qRLCJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer94195> No, the iPhone strips location data before sharing via Email or text message - whether you like it or not.   Now, this is true for the standard photo app in the iphone - this may not be true for 3rd party photo apps.  The official Facebook app for iphone also strips location info.  <comment64082> Given that the question asks "is location data is *retained*" and your answer clearly and correctly states that it usually is by Facebook or Twitter uploads, shouldn't your first statement be **YES** instead of No? <comment64086> @patrix Ups.... Mistake corrected :)
