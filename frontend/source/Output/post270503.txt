Can I search for text shown in Terminal by color? <body> If I run commands in Terminal the output is sometimes shown in red or green depending on the command.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bXYPu.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I search for such text by color (e.g. "Anything red" to find the line starting with "Connection refused")?  <comment339996> Can you pipe that command into a cat -v to see how that particular program is calling on the red text. `mycmd | cat -v`
