create your own "cheat sheets" and access them easily <body> I've seen that there are some applications like this one that allow you to see a cheat sheet with the key shortcuts for an application. I've also seen this project in the form of a widget. But what if you want to create your own cheat sheets. Then with a single key combination you access them, you can copy the text in them and so on. This would be a nice tool, but I haven't seen anything like this out there. I use the Terminal app a lot, and I would like to have a bunch of different cheat sheets for the things I regularly do in it. One cheat sheet for codegit/code commands, another for codevirtualenv/code commands, and so on. By the way, I could make alias to these and output to screen the commands, but I think there may be a better way to do what I want.  <comment171667> How about Widgets and separate notes for command groups? <comment171670> I don't want to use widgets because I don't want to change to that screen in order to find the cheat sheet. I guess what I want is to press a quick combination _Ã  la_ QuickSilver and then type the first characters of the program I'm interested in, and then to have the cheat sheet show up in the screen where I can actually select text. Then disregard the sheet with ESC. <comment171674> You can disable separate space for Widgets (it'll show as overlay). But this still does not meet Your needs.
