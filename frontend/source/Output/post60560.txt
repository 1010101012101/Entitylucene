Lion special characters input at Snow Leopard <body> Is there any 3rd party app to enable special character input on holding key for Snow Leopard same it is at Lion?  Thanks a lot.  <answer60567> Unfortunately no, I was also looking for this.  The closest I found was going to System Preferences, then International, then in the Input Menu tab, select Character Palette.  ul liIf you have only one keyboard input, this will add a menu item on the top right./li liIf you have more than one keyboard input, this item will be added below the flags of your keyboard inputs./li /ul  When you open the Character palette, you'll see on its left the categories of characters. I often work with mathematics so the Math and Greek categories are useful to me. If you click on the bottom strongCharacter Info/strong, it will show all related characters to the one you selected above in the palette.  e.g. if you choose the Latin 'u', you will see ü, û, ù, µ, etc. Double-click on any of those and it will paste itself on your working document.  Hope this could (partially) resolve your question.
