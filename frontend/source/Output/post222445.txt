How can I encrypt a disk where diskutil cs convert reports "a problem", leaves disk unreadable? <body> I'm trying to encrypt my Time Machine backup volume, but diskutil refuses, and leaves the disk unreadable (but repairable using Linux).  How can I proceed?  It's a Western Digital Elements 107C 3TB USB3 disk.  It has a single HFS+ partition and has been working fine.  codediskutil verifyDisk/code and codediskutil verifyVolume/code report no problems.  I have also used Alsoft DiskWarrior to repair discrepancies, without problems.  If I try to convert the volume, diskutil report "a problem", like this:  precoderb@Silverbird$ /usr/sbin/diskutil cs convert /Volumes/RB3TB1/ Started CoreStorage operation on disk4s2 RB3TB1 Resizing disk to fit Core Storage headers Creating Core Storage Logical Volume Group Attempting to unmount disk4s2 Switching disk4s2 to Core Storage Waiting for Logical Volume to appear Mounting Logical Volume A problem occurred; undoing all changes Switching partition from Core Storage type to original type Undoing creation of Logical Volume Group Reclaiming space formerly used by Core Storage metadata Error: -69842: Couldn't mount disk /code/pre  This leaves the disk unreadable.  codediskutil cs list/code shows the disk as a Core Storage volume which is "online" and "revertible" but it cannot be mounted or acted on, neither can the parent physical volume.  Disk Utility hangs on launch when the disk is connected.  codediskutil repairDisk/code on the parent volume reports:  precodeRepairing the partition map might erase disk4s1, proceed? (y/N) y Started partition map repair on disk4 Checking prerequisites Problems were encountered during repair of the partition map Error: -69808: Some information was unavailable during an internal lookup /code/pre  In fact, all access to the disk appears to be broken at this point.  precoderb@Silverbird$ sudo /usr/sbin/gpt show /dev/disk4 gpt show: unable to open device '/dev/disk4': Input/output error /code/pre  You can't even read the device using hexdump.  The kernel seems mightily confused.  I was able to recover the disk by mounting it in Linux and using the "gdisk" utility to change the partition type from AF02 (Core Storage) to AF00 (HFS+).  After that, diskutil verifies both the disk and the volume as OK.  I suspect Apple has a bug where diskutil fails to revert the partition type.  But this gets me no closer to encrypting my backup volume.  Does anyone have any idea what the "problem" might be and how I might proceed?  precoderb@Silverbird$ /usr/sbin/diskutil info /Volumes/RB3TB1   Device Identifier:        disk5s2   Device Node:              /dev/disk5s2   Whole:                    No   Part of Whole:            disk5   Device / Media Name:      RB3TB1    Volume Name:              RB3TB1    Mounted:                  Yes   Mount Point:              /Volumes/RB3TB1    File System Personality:  Journaled HFS+   Type (Bundle):            hfs   Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended (Journaled)   Journal:                  Journal size 229376 KB at offset 0x8f07408000   Owners:                   Enabled    Partition Type:           Apple_HFS   OS Can Be Installed:      Yes   Media Type:               Generic   Protocol:                 USB   SMART Status:             Not Supported   Volume UUID:              F096E831-F27D-3433-9BBE-6B65F4F69FA5   Disk / Partition UUID:    FE09034E-6AA0-4490-82A1-1F7E894ACD91    Total Size:               3.0 TB (3000110108672 Bytes) (exactly 5859590056 512-Byte-Units)   Volume Free Space:        78.1 GB (78142939136 Bytes) (exactly 152622928 512-Byte-Units)   Device Block Size:        4096 Bytes   Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes    Read-Only Media:          No   Read-Only Volume:         No    Device Location:          External   Removable Media:          No /code/pre  The disk contains around 732000000 files, according to Disk Utility (actually directory entries).

Edit: Here is the output of gpt when the disk is repaired.  precoderb@Silverbird$ sudo /usr/sbin/gpt -r show /dev/disk3       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2          4         Pri GPT table           6      76800      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       76806  732448757      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   732525563      32768      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   732558331          4         Sec GPT table   732558335          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  When the disk was unreadable (after the failed revert) nothing in OS X could read it, including gpt.  Linux "gdisk" reported it as having these same partitions, but the second partion with type "AF02" (Core Storage).  <answer222570> The disk is mounted in an enclosure which doesn't properly report a logical block size of 512 bytes. Instead 4096 bytes are used. The disk itself has a physical block size (Device Block Size) of 4096 bytes.  If the disk/volume don't show any errors in emDisk Utility/em, I would assume that CoreStorage and the enclosure &amp; hard disk aren't compatible.  I propose to use another method to encrypt your Time Machine backup:  ul liencrypted sparse image/li liencrypted sparsebundle image (similar to FileVault1)/li liencrypted image/li /ul  <comment269657> please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk5` (or whatever the disk identifier might be). <comment269722> gpt can't read the disk device when it is in the broken state. Nothing can from OS X. I can read and write it from Linux using "gdisk". I have added the output when repaired to the original post. <comment269723> Incidentally, I asked this over on the Apple forums as well https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7410991 <comment270048> Thanks. I'm pretty sure the disk and enclosure are healthy. But yes, it could be the case that Core Storage can't deal with a 4KiB block size. Is this limitation documented anywhere that you know of? <comment270049> @rptb1 I had several questions and answers here at apple.stackexchange which suggest that there might be problems with some USB/SATA controllers.  I never experienced them though because I don't have such an enclosure. <comment270050> For what it's worth, I've succesfully encrypted a Time Machine backup disk with this same machine, under OS X Mountain Lion, but with a LaCie USB 2.0 enclosure. I might try putting this disk in that and see what happens. I'll report back.
