Is there a way to force an update to Google Maps' offline maps on iOS? <body> On Google Maps for iOS (version 3.2.5.29671 as of the time of writing), I can save offline maps using the hidden trick described here. This works fine. However, Google Maps also wants to update offline maps periodically (every 30 days, I think). It has an irritating habit of popping up a dialog asking for this when I'm emnot/em on WiFi (when I don't want to update, because 3G is slow and expensive). I normally cancel the dialog (I'm in the middle of doing something), but I can't find a way to force the update when I'm back on WiFi later in the day. This means I get the same irritating pop-up the next day.  Is there a way to force or manually trigger the updates to the offline maps?  (this is on an iPhone 5s, if it matters).  <answer204314> It is almost one year after your post, but with the current version of Google Maps I have:  In Google Maps, go to the Menu, Select "Your places"  scroll down to "Offline maps" section  <comment246249> Excellent, thank you! That looks good.
