My mum spilt water on her laptop and now the shift key does not work <body> A few months back my mum spilt water on her laptop. Not knowing much about what to do, she turned it back on a few hours later rather than let it dry. Since then the left shift key does not work.  I do not know if it is related but now the mousepad occasionally stops working.  Is there anyway i can fix this?  It is a Macbook PRO SnowLeopard  <answer48665> The best thing you can do now is to send it in for a checkup.   <answer48679> You can use an external Keyboard for a while, but this really needs repair/KB replacement.  This will not be covered by your warranty, and might be expensive. Your local apple store/reseller/repair agent can advise.  You might be able to get it fixed on your home insurance.

They are designed to stay in place all the time as you use your computer. http://goo.gl/vD7BS <comment55785> @WheatWilliams Ditto! I would recommend the [Moshi Clearguard Keyboard Protector](http://store.moshimonde.com/clearguard-mb-us-layout.html).
