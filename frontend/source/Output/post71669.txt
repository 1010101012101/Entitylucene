Time machine freezes mac? <body> I had just installed new SSD on main bay and move HDD instead of SuperDrive on my 2011 MBP. All works perfectly but Time Machine. It freezes entire mac when I trying open codeOptions/code on codeTime machine/code preferences pane. I already removed old time machine config but its doesnt help me..  Any suggestions? Thank you.  strongUPD:/strong also it freezes on iTunes launch... Maybe its cuz of symlinks beetween HDD and SSD? I will try and reply soon.  strongUPD2:/strong no it is not a symbolic links.  <answer72129> So its solved by strongwait until freeze over/strong - its about an 20 mins. I do not know what exactly it was but now its works as should. If you have the same issue try to wait about an hour - maybe, it will helps you too.  <comment83735> Run Disk Utility and do a full disk scan.  You might have bad sectors.
