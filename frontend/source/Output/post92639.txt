How to diagnose/fix error when booting a G5? <body> I have an Apple G5 and it won boot anymore. When I boot my fan starts to spin like a madman and the screen stays grey.  When I try to boot in Safe Mode using kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdV/kbd, I get the error messages:  ul listrongerror - mapping module file com.apple.driver Apple Intel (CUPPowermanagement)/strong/li listrongcan't map in prparation for loading/strong/li listrongcan't determine dependencies for com.apple.driver Apple Intel  (CUPPowermanagement)/strong/li listrongcouldn't alloc class "Apple Intel CUPPowermanagement"/strong/li /ul  ..and nothing happens (only the fan is making some huge noise).  I've also tried to boot from the installation DVD but that isn't possible either. Besides a keyboard, screen and mouse, no additional hardware is connected to my mac at the moment.
