Pages 09 4.0.3 wants an update <body> When I open Pages 09 4.0.3, it tells me I need a software update; yet, running Software Update responds that all software is up to date.  I believe there is a later version of Pages with improved Lion support (like full page modes).  I've been to Apple Support pages download section: No dice.  How can I get that upgrade?  <answer22453> Ensure that the applications reside in /Applications/iWork '09 or the software update process does not seem to find them.  <comment24935> Could you edit / tag this with the OS you are using? Snow Leopard? <comment24941> This has happened to me, too. <comment24944> YAY, Kevin! I had taken all the apps out of the iWork folder to see them easier alphabetically. Once I put Pages, Numbers and Keynote in a folder with that name, Software Update saw them right away. Thank you.
