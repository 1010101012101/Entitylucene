While also meeting the following requirements:  ul liNot trans/re-encoding (and thus losing quality)/li liKeep the same file format/li liKeep play counts, import date, etc./li liKeep songs organized in playlists as they are/li /ul  I have thousands of purchased iTunes songs, so going one-by-one is not an option.  <comment328527> Maybe not a dupe, but similar to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/156538/does-a-purchased-itunes-song-contain-my-apple-id/156543#156543 <comment337075> Thanks for sharing.
