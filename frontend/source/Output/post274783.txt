How do I add spellcheck / dictionaries in macos Sierra? Got .aff and .dic files <body> I'm specifically trying to install system-wide support for Bulgarian. Tried looking for library/spelling but seems to be missing in macos Sierra. Got .aff and .dic files but... now what? Thank you.  <answer274787> Put them in Home/Library/Spelling.  To get to Home/Library, you hold down the option key while doing Finder  Go  <comment345638> Thank you Tom, but in Sierra there seems to be no Spelling folder. By following you instructions i go to home/library/services and can't add files there. <comment345652> @RadoslavRaykov That's not right, in Home/Library you should see a couple dozen folders, including (in the "s" area) services, sounds, spelling, suggestions.
