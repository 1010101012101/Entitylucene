Speakable items always activated after reboot <body> 13" MBP running on OSX 10.8.2:  Problem is that after reboot Speakable items is always on. I have to go all the way to Settings - Accessibility - Speakable items to turn it off again. I don't know why it's turned on by default after reboot. Can somebody help?  <answer80965> The Systems Preference app preferences file, just like that of any other app, can become corrupted. There are utilities--none free that I know of--that will check your preferences files, or you can simply move this file from ~/Library/Preferences to the trash and see if that fixes the problem. Close System Preferences first.  And I assume you've checked your login items.  <comment108967> Problem did not go away immediately after taking the steps above, also not after reboot, but some longer time afterwards. Not sure why. Anyway (a late) thanks for the answer! <comment109361> Post again if reappears. Maybe find & trash Speakable Items prefs ... also reset P-RAM.
