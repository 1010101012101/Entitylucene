Can't enter username in form with Silverlight <body> I have had to install MS Silverlight in order to carry out online marking of examination answers on platform 'RM Assessor'  The RM Assessor login page appears, with a username window and a password window. I know both of these.  The problem is this: when I type in my username, absolutely nothing happens. However I can type in the password.  There is a security setting in OS X which causes the problem and which can be reset. How do I know? I am marking exams for a second organisation which also uses RM Assessor and Silverlight. It took 90 minutes on the phone but eventually they found someone who knew what to do. But I can't contact them again.   So I'm stuck again.
