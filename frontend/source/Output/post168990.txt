open <TAB> opening finder window <body> I use zsh. For some reason, with zsh, when I type codeopen &lt;TAB&gt;/code (which should list the files to autocompletion), it opens Finder in the current folder.  I don't have anything aliased for that. I didn't change any config recently. I don't have any idea about why this is happening. Bash works, though.  Any ideas on how can I fix or debug that?  <answer169007> I can not reproduce this issue, so it should not happen by default. TAB works as expected in codezsh/code (as in codebash/code). What version of OSX are you using? This is in a standard terminal window right? Do you have something in your code.zshrc/code file relating to emcustom completion settings/em?  Try deleting your .zshrc file and run the codezsh/code shell again,  precodemv .zshrc .zshrc.old zsh /code/pre  This should fix your issue.  <answer169016> You can enable debug mode in ZSH using the -vx flags.  Open up terminal, and create a new ZSH instance:  precodezsh -vx /code/pre  Then, try your   precodeopen &lt;tab&gt; /code/pre  It should print out everything it's trying to match on, and any processing it's doing. Might give you a clue as to which setting is influencing this behaviour. I can't replicate on mine.  <answer171317> Found the problem.  codewhich open/code always shown code/usr/bin/open/code, but codewhich _open/code showed me this:  precode_open() {    if [ "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin" ]; then      open "$1" 2&gt; /dev/null    else      xdg-open "$1" &amp;&gt; /dev/null    fi  } /code/pre  Which was declared by a plugin that I was using.  Functions prefixed with code_/code are used as autocompletion functions, and that's why my codeopen/code autocompletion was broken.
