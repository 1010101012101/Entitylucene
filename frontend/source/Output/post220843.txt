OS X unable to update outdated app icon in Launchpad <body> I have an app which is installed in OS X. It needs a certain software patch currently to make it run successfully in the latest OS, and we are sending the patch as a standalone separate app, which when installed, does the necessary things (mainly updating a codeConfig/code file within the code&lt;MyApp&gt;.app/code folder in code/Applications/code). After this, double clicking the app icon in Finder launches it fine. But when we try to launch it by clicking the icon in the codeLaunchpad/code, it doesn't open. (this is the problem which we are solving, it won't open even from Finder by double clicking without the patch).  So I tried to refresh the Launchpad by these things:  precoderm ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/*.db defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock cd $TMPDIR../0/com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/ &amp;&amp; rm db* /code/pre  Nothing works. It still doesn't open. Only upon restarting the Mac does the codeLaunchpad/code click work and the app launches.  Is it possible in any way to fix this without requiring a restart?  OS - Yosemite, El Capitan both.  <answer222516> I recently come up with the same question.  precodeunlink Library/Application\ Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db touch /Applications/YourAppName.app killall Dock /code/pre  the codetouch(1)/code command is very important. things would not work without it. I think maybe the Dock does not update its db unless the app was updated.  <comment267345> Does restarting the LaunchServices help? <comment267347> Doesn't `defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true;` do that? <comment267351> Maybe try this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125402/icons-remains-the-same-after-i-have-changed-the-default-program-for-opening-the <comment267388> Doesn't work. Same result... <comment269730> Nope. Doesn't work. It should be `~/Library` by the way...
