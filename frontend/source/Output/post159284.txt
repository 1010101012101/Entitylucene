How to know if Drive is SSD or HDD through Terminal? <body> I would like to know if there is a way through Terminal commands in Mac OS X to find if an external drive is SSD or HDD.  <answer159298> A very dirty solution ;-) : Enter codesystem_profiler | grep "Media Type: SSD"/code in codeTerminal.app/code.  A more detailed approach is codesystem_profiler SPSerialATADataType/code and you'll get all devices attached to your SATA interfaces with - beyond other informations - the codeMedium Type/code which may be Rotational or SSD.br By adding code-xml &gt; ~/Desktop/MyReport.spx/code you will get a XML-file on your desktop which can be opened by codeSystem Information.app/code.  <answer259807> You can use codediskutil/code to get this info:  precodediskutil info disk0 | grep "Solid State" /code/pre  You will receive a "Yes/No" answer similar to the following:  precodeSolid State:              Yes /code/pre  Note:  This does not work for USB drives.  <comment187233> For external drives..it dosent say much details...because all i got is Capacity,BSD Name,Content. any idea? <comment187237> i'm looking into it...i fear it will be difficult
