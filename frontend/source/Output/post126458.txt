What cable do I need to go iPad audio out to macbook air mic in? <body> I have an iPad with various midi apps on it that I'd like to send directly to my MacBook air to record (in Audacity).   I'm confused as to what cable I need for this. It appears to use the headphone jack as a mic, I need to make sure I have the 'three ring' jack (like the one on the apple earbuds + mic). What do I need on the iPad jack? Just the standard 2 ring audio out?   If so, what is this cable called? I found this one on monoprice. Would that work?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8fpaV.jpg" alt="magic cable"
