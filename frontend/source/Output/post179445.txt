two itunes apple accounts <body> i have been using my itunes account on my phone to buy music, but when i went to log in on my PC it wouldn't work(i was using the wrong email) when i went to make a new one i put in an itunes voucher that had been given to me and created that account on the email that i thought my original account was on. but i have now managed to find my other email and itunes account. is there a way that i could transfer the money from one account to the other?   <answer179451> No. There's no cross-pollination of Apple IDs.   Best you could probably do is set up Family Sharing &amp; invite your other account into that 'family'
