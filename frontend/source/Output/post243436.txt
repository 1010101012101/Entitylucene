Can you, and if so, how, set a repeat rate for mouse buttons? <body> I have an external mouse, with programmable buttons. I'd like to set some of those buttons to repeat if I hold one of them down- similar to how keyboard keys repeat, but don't see where to do that.   <answer284034> You can do this with a a product called ControllerMate.  They have a feature called the  Auto-Repeater Building Block     The Auto-Repeater building block provides a way to automatically   repeat events at a fixed rate.      An Auto-Repeater building block has one ON/OFF input and one ON/OFF   output. While the input is ON, the output turns ON and OFF at a   predetermined rate.      To configure an Auto-Repeater building block, enter the rate at which   it should turn its output ON and OFF. The rate can be given as the   number of repeats per second, or seconds per repeat.   (They provide an example on the page linked above)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQenb.png" alt="enter image description here"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bsH05m.png" alt="enter image description here"  Basically, if the Building Block detects an "on" state of an input (holding the button) it will auto repeat whatever you tell it to repeat at a set rate.  You will have to bypass the programming of the mouse and use this to program it.  I have done this with my Logitech MX Professional mouse and a second (Logitech) keyboard which I have reassigned keys to complex macros.  Controller Mate has an unlimited trial period that is limited to 10 "building blocks" meaning you can have a single work flow of 10 blocks or 5 flows of 2 blocks or whatever combination so long as it has no more than 10.  However, at $25, it's a very reasonable solution.  <comment299788> Interesting question, but I'd instinctively say it can't be done [easily] as then how would you differentiate between holding the button down to drag something vs. run a repeat click? <comment299804> Ideally, it's up to you to configure. For me, I'd leave right and left-click alone, and let my other buttons repeat. <comment358166> I'm looking for this too. I use an IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 with SteerMouse with back and forward buttons mapped to `cmd+[` and it repeats too quickly. <comment358179> There are some auto-clicker apps [listed here](http://www.murgaa.com/auto-clicker-mac/) that might help, though it appears they mainly trigger on keyboard shortcuts rather than just holding down the mouse button. Caveat: I've never used or installed any of them.
