Open Ruby installed gems in editor <body> How to open installed gems in editor such Sublime Text or Text Mate or Atom?  I would like to do it from command line like:  codeopen -a Sublime\ Text\ 2 something_here/code  <answer126057>   If you use the Ruby that comes with 10.9, gems are installed in code/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0//code:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeopen /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/plist-3.1.0/lib/plist/parser.rb /code/pre  If you use a Ruby installed with Homebrew, gems are installed in code/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/*/gems//code.  <answer285424> If you are using bundler for your project, you can use codebundle open/code to automatically open an installed gem in your editor as specified by the EDITOR environment variable.  For example, codeEDITOR="subl -w" bundle open rake/code will open the version of rake your project is using in Sublime Text.  See http://bundler.io/v1.10/bundle_open.html  <comment147603> so, I need to search in directory `/Library/Ruby/Gems/*`?
