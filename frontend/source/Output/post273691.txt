compressord starting up every time I turn on my MacBook <body> I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) running macOS 10.12.3 and have Compressor 4.3 installed. Every time when I restart my Mac, there are 2 processes called compressord, and CompressorHelper that got automatically started and causing my MacBook to use the discrete graphics card (which consumes a lot of battery power). One way to get rid of them is to open Compressor and quit it afterward. But it is annoying since every time I startup my Mac I need to do this process.  Is there a way to stop these two processes from opening up every time I start up my Mac? (Possibly without reinstalling Compressor as that takes up a very long time to do for me)  <answer285176> This problem cropped up for me when I used Compressor after not having used it in a long time. I've found that if I launch and quit Compressor after starting my computer then the process goes away but I haven't yet figured out how to make it stop running on boot.  <answer285228> The first place to check is your login items under Users and Groups - your username in System Preferences. If Compressor isn't in the login items list then look in your LaunchAgents folder at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ . If you decide to go the second route, make sure to only delete the compressor launch agent.  Note: I don't know what compressor is exactly so this may not be the most accurate.  <comment344067> Why are you restarting so often? <comment344069> @samh OK, it is either because my computer freezes (or other glitches) or I need to debug a script.
