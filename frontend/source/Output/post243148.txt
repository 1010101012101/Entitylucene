Processor or RAM? <body> I want to buy a macbook pro in the near future, but choosing the configuration has been a headache for me so far. My options are :  Macbook Pro 13" Retina 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel strongCore i5/strong, Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz strong16GB/strong 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM  strong128GB/strong PCIe-based Flash Storage   Or  Macbook Pro 13" Retina 3.1GHz Dual-core Intel strongCore i7/strong, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz strong8GB/strong 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM  strong128GB/strong PCIe-based Flash Storage   Or  MacBook Pro 13" (non-retina) 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel strongCore i7/strong, Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz strong8GB/strong 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM â€” 2x4GB strong500GB/strong Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm   I do photo editing quiet a lot. That's the reason i want to change my current laptop since its slow for editing photos and maybe sometimes playing some games. If you can help me decide i would really appreciate it.  Thanks  <answer243157> (Note: This may be a bit opinionated due to the nature of this question, and I'll mostly focus on photo editing.)  From what I have seen, (at least on Photoshop) RAM and SSDs are the most important. There have been people who have run on i5s and get by just as well.   If you can avoid it, don't get the Non-Retina (i.e. get the Retina) especially because you are doing photo editing and it always helps to have a higher resolution while editing so that higher resolution pictures can be used. Also, the drive is not a SSD so it will run slower.  I would recommend getting the first option as you have said:     Mac[B]ook Pro 13" Retina 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz 16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM 128GB PCIe-based Flash Storage   simply because of the following reasons (as opposed to the second option that has the i7):  ol liThe clock speeds are roughly the same (0.2GHz w/o Turbo Boost, 0.1GHz with)/li liHaving multiple threads (all i7s have hyperthreading which doubles the amount of threads) only helps in certain tasks./li liThe two above reasons (in my opinion) do not justify adding USD$200 to the price, while the 16GB of RAM will help, even though it is USD$80 more than the first option./li /ol  For gaming: get the second option. More threads will improve gaming performance and all i7s have hyper-threading. The i7 also has a faster clock speed.  And if it is possible, you may want to just get the faster CPU and the larger RAM, since you want to both game and photo edit.  <comment299354> BTW, I wouldn't suggest using a mac to play games - it isn't known for games. You should use Windows on a VM or bootcamp. <comment299355> Is a cost a factor? Are you reluctant to get a certain model due to its price? If not I would suggest both more RAM and better CPU.
