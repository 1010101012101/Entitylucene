How to create a text file in a folder <body> In windows I right click and then there is an option to create a text file.  How to do so in mac?  <answer84311> There's two ways to do this, the easiest is the first option;  ol liOpen emTextEdit/em and type whatever you need into it then save it to the location you want the file to live.  You can open emTextEdit/em quickly by invoking emSpotlight/em and being typing emTex.../em, you should see the emtop hit/em is the app you want so you can just press enter to open it./li liThis is more involved and will require you to create an AppleScript.  The contents of the script needs to be:  codetell application "Finder" to make new file at (the target of the front window) as alias/code/li /ol  Export the script as an emApplication/em somewhere safe and make sure you tick emRun Only/em when saving it.  Then drag the resulting file to the emtoolbar/em in emFinder/em  This will then allow you to create a blank text file in what ever window you're viewing in emFinder/em called codeuntitled/code which you can then double click to edit in emTextEdit/em  The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide To AppleScript, is good if you want to know more about AppleScript.  <answer84316> You can also do this in Terminal. Go to the directory where you want to create the file, then run the following:  precodetouch file.txt /code/pre  Or redirect 'nothing' to a text file  precode&gt; file.txt /code/pre  <answer84326> I use PathFinder as a replacement for Finder and it includes this in its right-click context menu. It is prboably too expensive a solution just for this but if you want to have a better Finder for other reasons as well.  <answer84355> There are two useful utilities that you can download and install that will enable you to create a new text file (or RTF file) in a currently-open folder that you are viewing using the Finder.  The utilities are called NewTextFileHere and NewRTFHere and can be downloaded from  http://mac.softpedia.com/developer/Jonas-Wisser-37498.html  Icons for either of these apps can then be included on all of your Finder windows.  <answer84387> Here's my script for creating new files from a store of templates.

And your done.  If you can't see your .rtf file extension, than you need to make it visible in settings somewhere. Then it will be as easy as changing it under windows.   Easy, but annoying that you can't save as a text file in the first place.  P.S. Once you have changed it to a .txt file. You can then edit it with a text editor like TextEdit and save it and it will still be a .txt file.  <answer214868> Here is my workaround:  ol liDo this once, create an empty text file in your desktop to serve as template./li likbdOpt/kbd/kbdAlt/kbd-drag this file to the folder to make a copy./li /ol  <answer223418> This article from MacWorld indicates how to create a service that creates a new text file.  <answer229054> If you have the Finder window open, use Spotlight to open TextEdit.

Now you have it in one click for all your finder windows, and it will prompt you what file name you want instead of just creating a dumb file name.

Unlike in windows I can't even copy that directory as text <comment97081> In Terminal, you can type cd, then a space, then drag a folder onto the Terminal window and press Return to go to that folder. <comment97086> In 10.8 and later you can also drag the folder on a Terminal window while holding command. Or if you copy the folder, ⌘V inserts its path in Terminal. <comment134080> Or use "stationary Pad" in the finder, which does this, and is a built in OS function. <comment209321> None are convenience for users. For a text file, I have to open up a terminal type a command and drag and drop then type another command! Come on! <comment213384> Great Question. I can't figure out why I need to run an application or install an application to do this. <comment213401> I have to say this is a great question.. and it always makes me wonder what the heck they were thinking when the decided to make something so simple so hard. <comment221214> this is one of the two biggest reasons why I think Macs are crap, the other being the single-click mouse. horrible. otherwise, miracles of engineering. <comment253073> This solution is great if you're got Alfred with the powerpack so you can just use a hotkey over a finder window <comment269427> @AlexMills you think Macs are crap because you can't right-click and create a blank file???  What's the point of that anyways?   If you need to create a text file... open TextEdit or something.    I honestly don't see the point here...  ? <comment269446> yes I do  think Macs are crap because you can't right-click and create a blank file <comment288633> You mentioned 'also'. What was the first method? <comment295546> Thanks sgtbeano, the solution with the application is exactly what I was looking for. Please let me know how to automatically open the created file? <comment303384> this means being smart without being oversmart - awesome <comment318997> If you don't specify name of the file, the service would number the files like so `untitled`, then `untitled 2` and so on wuthout causing an error. <comment322786> This no longer works on OSX.11 without disabling integrity protection which even the software author discourages. <comment329492> OS X El Capitan Finder is not accepting the Application file dragged into the Finder toolbar. <comment335712> @apricot Mavericks and above requires that you hold Command+Option while dragging in order to be able to drag it to the Finder toolbar. Be sure to export the script as an Application first as mentioned above (File  Export). <comment335967> how do you create file.txt in s a subdir? you have to use cd ? <comment338315> Hm, for me the script creates new `untitled` files in Applications folder and not in the current folder I'm in. <comment338316> When I enter the name of a file and click OK, I get `You don't have permission to create a file here` <comment347085> Its all just more oriented towards basic users rather than experts. <comment363042> 1. The title bar of TextEdit does not have a text file icon. 2. TextEdit does not offer to save it as a simple txt file. Only RTF, .html, odt, word and webarchive is possible <comment369720> This works pretty well thanks. Is there a way to add two features? Can the new file be saved directly as 'newfile.txt'?  At the moment I get the Services option only when I right click on a Folder Icon, is there a way to get that option while clicking on a Finder window? <comment374291> 1. The title bar icon appears shortly after creating the new document. 2. Textedit can be configured to use plain text by default. This means new files will be saved as txt not rtf. 3. I had to option+drag to get it to move the file to the desired location, rather than create a shortcut.
