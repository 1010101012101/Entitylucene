Why can't my iPhone sync with my hp laptop and how can I fix it? <body> I have an iPhone 4s and I'm connecting it to my HP computer with Windows 8.1 OS. I don't have iTunes on it yet. When I connect it syncs then un syncs very fast almost as if my laptop is rejecting it. The Lightning works because when I connect it to a charger socket it charges perfectly. The USB port works because I can insert flash.  Are there any drivers needed and do I have to download them? Is it mandatory to install iTunes?  <comment231703> Easy fix - get iTunes. It contains the drivers necessary for the iPhone to connect. <comment231762> What do you want to do with the iPhone when conected? Just charge it? Download pictures? Manage media? <comment246391> @Tetsujin sorry for the wait but even if I downloaded iTunes ( 12.2.2.25 ) the computer still rejects  the iPhone what is the problem! <comment246394> Rejects it? How? Does it mount & dismount repeatedly? That could be the USB not supplying sufficient power - an iPhone is not the same as a flash drive in that respect. <comment246398> @Tetsujin it mounts then dismounts instantaneously and the USB works fine. What can I do about it? <comment246400> other than try it on a powered external hub, or try the laptop mains powered, I'm not really sure
