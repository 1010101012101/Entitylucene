Change terminal command prompt for root user in Sierra <body> I can change the bash command prompt for the Terminal for an ordinary user without issue. (In my case, I modified the $PS1 variable in /etc/bashrc.) However, that change does not modify the command prompt when one elevates privileges to root using codesudo -s/code.    Does anyone know where the command prompt preference is stored on a macOS Sierra (10.12.5) machine for an admin user who has elevated his privileges to root using codesudo -s/code?  I have tried modifying the following files...  ul li/var/root/.bash_profile/li li/var/root/.bash_rc/li li/var/root/bash_rc/li li/var/root/.profile/li li~/.profile/li /ul  I have also tried using the command codeexport PS1="Some prompt here# "/code, which changes the root prompt temporarily, but it does not stick when the session is ended and a new one is started.  <answer290806> Add the codeSUDO_PS1/code environment variable to your code~/.bash_profile/code and then codeexport/code the variable, such as:  codeexport SUDO_PS1="\[\h:\w\] \u\\$ "/code  Note however this will only change the root prompt as it appears after you have elevated your rights via codesudo/code.  A good list of codeprompt/code variables can be found here.  <answer290824> I am assuming that you are not actually logging in to your Mac as coderoot/code since enabling root login is a strongreally bad thing/strong.  So you are using the command codesudo -s/code to open a root shell from your own login. Under those circumstances the profile being run is your own. The best way to make any changes, such as to the prompt is to use an codeif/code in your profile, for example   precode# color prompt and make root red if [ `id -u` = 0 ] then     PS1="\[\033[31m\]\h:\W \u\$\[\033[0m\] " else     PS1="\[\033[34m\]\h:\w \u\$\[\033[0m\] " fi /code/pre  In this example the top PS1 is for root and sets the prompt to red and the second PS1 is for any other user, e.g. you. You can make any other environment changes you want in the codeif/code as well.  <answer290940> From the codesudo/code manual:  precode-s, --shell    Run the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or the shell                specified by the invoking user's password database entry.  If a command is specified, it                is passed to the shell for execution via the shell's -c option.  If no command is                specified, an interactive shell is executed. /code/pre  An interactive shell would read the invoking user's code.bashrc/code. So, Tony Williams' solution would work if it is in your code.bashrc/code. But da4's solution should also work if it is placed in your code.bash_profile/code.   <comment367165> Is this for a machine that has the root account enabled? <comment367249> No, the root account is not enabled.  I am trying to get the prompt to change when I do a "sudo -s" from an admin user. <comment367250> The above works, but only temporarily. If I quit terminal and then relaunch it, the changes are not saved. <comment367251> Yes, you are correct. I am logging in as an admin user and elevating my privileges to root using "sudo -s".  Your answer does not change the prompt when I have elevating my privileges to root.  I did up-vote it though, as I really like the prompt color change. <comment367321> If you simply enter that `export` into an existing shell, then yes, the changes will not persist.  You must add it to your `~/.bash_profile`.  Tested & confirmed on 10.11.6. <comment367388> Thank you.  Modifying ~/.bashrc changed the root prompt when using sudo -s.
