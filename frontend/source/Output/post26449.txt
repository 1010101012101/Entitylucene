How to start a slideshow on the Mac super quick and easy? <body> This is one thing I don't quite get it for the Mac: why is it so hard to start a slideshow?  The most often way is, I have several photos on the Desktop or in Downloads, and I double click to see the first one -- and no, it is not the one I want, so I want to see the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.   At least on Win 7, that's super easy just by pressing the right arrow on the keyboard and that's it.  On the Mac, is there a super easy way?  I don't want to highlight this and that, and then choose "Slideshow" from some where I can't be sure of, or change the view to the "flip through" view, because I might not necessarily want to change the view style for the folder at the moment -- I just want to browse through a few photos -- is there a super quick way?  <answer26450> If you use OS X "Quick Look" you can use right/left arrow on the keyboard and view all of the photo on the same path; but you have some problem yet, "Quick Look" let you view all the file exist in the same path not just photo.  <answer26451> In Leopard and later versions (up to El Capitan), select the files you want in the Finder and press the spacebar to invoke QuickLook. You can then use the arrow keys to cycle through them. If you click the full-screen icon in the upper right-hand corner, QuickLook displays a slideshow.  In Tiger, there is a "Slideshow" option in the context menu in the Finder.  In Panther and earlier, it is indeed several steps before you can get a slideshow.  <answer26526> I am using Snow Leopard:  ol liClick on the first file you want to see/li liPress Space Bar to start quick look/li liPress up or down arrow key to cycle through all photos / videos / any docs (up or down arrow depending on how you have the items sorted in the list)/li /ol  that's it!  (still, I don't understand why the default Preview won't let you cycle through anything?)  strongUpdate/strong: unfortunately, this is only possible if you are in the Cover Flow view (the flip through view).  <answer122059> Select a picture or group of images from the desktop, then use the following:  ul liOption+Spacebar to launch image(s) into the full-screen slideshow mode /li liSpacebar to pause/play the image slideshow /li liLeft Arrow to go back, Right Arrow to go forward /li liGesture with two-fingers left to go forward, two-finger gesture right to go back /li liOption to view smaller images at actual size /li liClick “Index Sheet” to view thumbnails of all images in the slideshow /li liClick “Add to iPhoto” to import the image into iPhoto /li liHold Control key and use a two-fingered back or forward swipe in to zoom into the photo /li liEscape to exit /li /ul  <comment30260> If you read my answer or @Daniel answer you find that it's a same solution. <comment30261> oh yes, i found this out from your answers... your answers seem to need to select which files to look at first... my answer doesn't need to <comment342739> sadly this convenient feature has been removed in El Capitan. I guess they're trying to force Apple Photos upon us.
