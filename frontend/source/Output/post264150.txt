Status of Trackpad by Terminal <body> After upgrading to 1600mhz RAM for my 2011 MBP which used to have 1000mhz, I see at 2 weeks interval my trackpad gets unresponsive. My MBP is always on and I do not shut it down or put it into sleep.  No cursor is present and no magic gestures working by trackpad.  I see keyboard is working, I can switch between apps by CMD + TAB. Apps also seem to respond to keyboard events.  After restarting MBP, everyting returns fine.  How can I see the status of the trackpad? I mean I want to make sure the non-responsive cursor and moue gestures are caused by trackpad.  If trackpad is disabled or something, can I restart trackpad by terminal?  Is trackpad issue related to something memory overflow or something because using 1600mhz? I did not have this trackpad issue before upgrading RAMs?
