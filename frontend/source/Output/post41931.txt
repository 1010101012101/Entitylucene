Snow Leopard Server - Error uploading videos to wiki from IE <body> We are running a Mac server (10.6) in our school district to share videos that teachers have created. I have found that Internet Explorer and Firefox could have a problem viewing the videos, but have found the fix for that if needed in this knowledge base article: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3747  The problem that we are having involved uploading audio or video as an attachment to a wiki. This error only occurs when a teacher is using Internet Explorer, which is the vast majority of our users.  What seems to happen is when uploading a video with any other browser, the wiki creates code like this:  precode&lt;img src="https://www.ourserver.com/groups/ourgroupname/wiki/69e6e/attachments/bc1c7/Savin g%20as%20an%20mp4%20%281%29.mp4.png" name="{&amp;quot;isMovie&amp;quot;: true, &amp;quot;width&amp;quot;: 640, &amp;quot;height&amp;quot;: 360}" title="Download file &amp;quot;Saving as an mp4 (1).mp4&amp;quot;" longdesc="/groups/ourgroupname/wiki/69e6e/attachments/bc1c7/Saving%20as%20an%20 mp4%20%281%29.mp4" alt="Download file &amp;quot;Saving as an mp4 (1).mp4&amp;quot;" class="attachment_handle_img quicklookable"&gt; &lt;span class="quicklook"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre  When you upload the same file with Internet Explorer, it creates code like this:  precode&lt;a class="attachment quicklookable" href="/groups/ourgroupname/wiki/69e6e/attachments/d1747/Saving_as_an_mp4_%281%2 9.mp4"&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.ourserver.com/groups/ourgroupname/wiki/69e6e/attachments/d1747/Savin g_as_an_mp4_%281%29.mp4.png" alt="Download file &amp;quot;Saving_as_an_mp4_(1).mp4&amp;quot;" class="attachment_handle_img quicklookable" longdesc="/groups/ourgroupname/wiki/69e6e/attachments/d1747/Saving_as_an_mp4_%2 81%29.mp4" title="Download file &amp;quot;Saving_as_an_mp4_(1).mp4&amp;quot;"&gt; &lt;span class="quicklook"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre  The user sees no errors, and can download their video, but can not use the quicklook function of the wiki to watch the video right in the webpage. I have seen this happen for .mp4 and .mp3 files, but .pdf files seemed to work correctly, no matter the which browser uploaded the file. Any idea why the browser a user has would cause the wiki to create different code when a video is uploaded? I was hoping the local genius bar would be able to help, but they had no ideas.
