Showing wrong name in terminal <body> My Macbook's name is 'Suman'img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1CWBZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here". But in terminal I have something different. How to solve it ?  <answer115703> Unless you've changed it, the default Bash prompt is  precodecomputer-name:directory username$ /code/pre  Therefore it's correct.  hr  precodeSuman:~ beautifulmind$ /code/pre  …means your computer is called codeSuman/code, you're in your home folder code~/code and your account is codebeautifulmind/code.  <comment135368> How to change the account ? <comment135369> @Suman See [this Apple KB article](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1428?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US). <comment135421> → Suman: this is a new question and you should avoid questions within comments. No one will be able to find the relevant answer to your new question by digging in every question comments. <comment135423> The command to display your computer name within a `Terminal` window is `hostname`. From your screen copy it is correct. <comment135425> In the interest of having a good searchable question, let's leave the terminology here intact even though to people familiar with shell and host names, the title here is less precise than we might like.
