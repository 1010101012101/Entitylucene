Transfer contacts between iPhone 4 and old feature phone <body> I recently upgraded to an iPhone 4 from an old Samsung SGH-G600 and want to transfer contacts. At the shop they offered to do it for me for Â£15 which I thought was ridiculous so I'm hoping there's a way to do this other than manual.  The iPhone is non-jailbroken and the old Samsung phone does have Bluetooth.  <answer90758> It's impossible to transfer files via bluetooth between iPhone and other smart phones.You will need to transfer the contacts from your old Samsung SGH-G600 into your computer first, and then sync it to your iPhone 4. I don't know what operating system your computer is running, but normally you can do as the following steps:  ol liOpen iTunes/li liUse USB cable to connect your Samsung to computer, copy the contacts to your iTunes library./li liThen plug in your iPhone 4 to computer using the included USB cable, select the content you wanna sync in iTunes under Devices on the left-hand side./li liClick Apply, in the lower-right corner of the screen, to sync./li /ol  You can find some useful information from apple's support: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1386  <comment102260> Do you have any way to get the contacts onto a PC? I'm surprised they want to charge so much for just transferring contacts. <comment102264> @bassplayer7 So was I, there might be a USB cable some where by I was hoping for a direct phone-to-phone route <comment102275> I'm very confident there are no USB cables/software combinations that will allow you to directly transfer the contacts over. Even if you were to use the iPhone's USB cable and adapt it to mini-USB (if your old Samsung supports it), I don't think that the iPhone (or Samsung) would recognize each other enough to transfer contacts.
