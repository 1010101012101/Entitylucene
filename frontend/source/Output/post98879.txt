AppleTV rent movie without finishing transaction <body> Tonight we were in the process of renting a movie on our AppleTV, we got to the step of it asking for the password and then we suddenly had to leave.  It sat there at the password screen and about 2 hours later we backed out deciding to not finish the transaction and perhaps rent the movie another night.  However, when backing out we noticed that the movie detail screen now displayed that the movie was ready to be watched, as if we had finished the transaction. We hit play and the movie started.  My first thought was that we got the movie for free because I haven't seen it show up on my paypal yet - but I have seen transactions take a while to post.  My question is not whether this is a bug or not, but whether there is some sort of functionality that allows something like this to happen?  I didn't have it configured to remember my password - otherwise I wouldn't have seen the password dialog come up at all - right?    <comment116236> Is your question if you got the movie for free or were you charged for it! do you have a Cat :) <comment149170> Did you pay for the film or not? <comment149586> @DavidSykes The transaction appeared on my paypal account about 3 days later. Therefore, it looks like the purchase did not require authentication - this has to be a bug on the part of the AppleTV system? <comment149642> @dtmland I recently bought a film with no authentication required, however I was not asked for a password so in my case it is possible 'remember password' got checked somehow. I agree that seems unlikely to be your cause
