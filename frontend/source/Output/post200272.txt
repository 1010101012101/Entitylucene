Time Machine Backup Failed <body> Ive been using my Time Machine for almost 3 years without any problems. It's a 3 TB LaCie. This week it has decided to stop backing up my work. I tried repairing the disk and unmounting and remounting the disk a number of times but it's not working. After remounting the disk, it runs for about 10 minutes and then stops. Each time I then try to manually run a backup it immediately gives me an error message. The initial message I get is em"Time Machine couldn't back up to 'LaCie'"/em. When I click on the details it tells me that an error occurred whilst creating the 'backup folder'. It has suggested that I verify and repair the disk, but I have done this to no avail.  I'm currently still running Mavericks on my Mac.  Is there a solution to this?  <answer200287> I had an issue with backups not completing and I solved it by deleting the partially created backup folder.  First turn time machine off (System Preferences  Time Machine  Off)  Navigate to code/Volumes/VOLUMENAME/Backups.backupdb/COMPUTERNAME//code, where you will see a list of folders dated by when the backup was created. If you see a folder with code.inProgress/code in the name, move it to the trash.  Turn time machine back on and complete a backup. If it fails again, I'd recommend taking a look at the resources here: http://pondini.org/TM/C10.html  <comment241282> I should also note that I have 155 GB free on the disk so its not an error caused by a full disk <comment241321> I tried deleting the '.inProgress' folder and it kept saying I didn't have the required permissions. However, I didn't do this with my time machine turned off. I will try this. <comment241334> If you cannot delete it, select it in Finder, press command+i, and click the padlock in the lower-left-hand corner, and check "Ignore permissions on this volume" <comment279225> I tried a few things but then the disk stopped responding completely. It's been running constantly for the past 3 years so it looks like it's reached the end of its life. I've now got a new disk and a paperweight/door stop <comment335836> @EzekielElin AFAIK the padlock has always been in the lower _right_ hand corner... Where did you see "Ignore permissions"? I'm running macOS Sierra. <comment336293> @Arc676 Ignore permissions only shows up on volumes, and I don't know why I said left hand, sorry.
