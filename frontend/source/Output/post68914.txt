iOS 5 Maps : Google only gets directions for vague locations <body> I'm not sure if this is a Google problem or an iOS issue in general, but here is the situation.   Case 1 :  I search for directions for a vague address in the iOS maps (eg My Current Location to (say) Capgemini, Vikhroli Google finds the exact address, routes direction options to me, and I start my journey In the background (on my iPhone), the Maps app stores the Exact directions. ie Capgemini India Pvt Ltd, Plant-2, A-Wing, Godrej IT Park......  Case 2 :  Now when I start typing (again say) Capgemini in my next directions search, I get the automatic typing prompt with the Exact address in it When I try searching for directions with this Exact address, I get the Google Error : "Could not find directions between these two places"   Any ideas on this one ??   <comment80111> So, iOS 5 Maps, even though it is no longer Google Maps, still sometimes gets "Google errors"? <comment81245> Specifically iOS 5 Maps IS the SAME as Google Maps while iOS 6 maps is NOT Google maps.   iOS 6 Maps doesn't seem to be giving this error. Atleast I can't reproduce it yet. But the Google Maps are definitely bugged with this. <comment81275> My mistake.  iOS 6 was introduced with iPhone 5, but iOS 5 was introduced with iPhone 4S.  Too much to remember... <comment82116> Case 2 is a very common case where google has the information as to where your endpoints are located, but lacks a database to calculate a route between the two. If the routing works from your current location, then perhaps you have determined that the problem lies in the directions database from the first point since things work  from the current location. Does this match your experience?
