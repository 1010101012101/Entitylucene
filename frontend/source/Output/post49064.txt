How to upgrade iPhone 4 baseband *without* doing a Restore <body> I recently unlocked my AT&amp;T iPhone 4.  Before then, I was always preserving the baseband when doing jailbreaks.  So my question now is this: How can I emjust/em upgrade the baseband to the one that ships with iOS 5.0.1 and still keep the untethered jailbreak? Is there a command line tool to do emonly/em a baseband image upgrade?  <comment56156> You cannot do this. <comment56228> @cksum is correct. This is not possible on the iPhone 4. If you had a 3G, you could do it, though. <comment60815> Thank you for the answer @cksum. An upgrade to 5.1.1 was the answer.
