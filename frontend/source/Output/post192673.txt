Downloading large photos from Photo Stream on iPad <body> Downloading from Photo Stream gives me a small size picture (approx 200 KB) and I want to download the full size (1 to 2 MB) file. How can this be done?  What is the criteria for deleting my iPad photos? I have lost a lot of older photos without any notification or approval.  <answer192681> On your first question, this is what the Apple My Photo Stream FAQ says:     h2What resolution are My Photo Stream photos?/h2      On a Mac or PC, your photos are downloaded and stored in full   resolution. On iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV, your photos are   delivered in a device-optimized resolution that speeds downloads and   saves storage space. Dimensions will vary, but an optimized version of   a photo taken by a standard point-and-shoot camera will have a 2048 x   1536 pixel resolution when pushed to your devices. Panoramic photos   can be up to 5400 pixels wide.   On the second question, the Photo Stream criteria for deletion –not the images you took or saved with the device, which stay indefinitely on the Camera Roll– is defined as follows in the same document:     h2How long are My Photo Stream photos stored in iCloud?/h2      The photos you upload to My Photo Stream are stored in iCloud for 30   days to give your devices plenty of time to connect and download them.      h2How many photos are stored in My Photo Stream on my devices and computers?/h2      My Photo Stream pushes all your photos to the My Photo Stream album on   your devices and computers, and manages them efficiently, so you don’t   run out of storage space.        Your iOS devices keep a rolling collection of your last 1000 photos in   the My Photo Stream album. From there, you can browse your recent   photos or move the ones you like to another album to keep them on your   device forever.   <comment229365> Hi Allan, welcome to Ask Different! You have two questions here and it will be preferable if you asked them separately
