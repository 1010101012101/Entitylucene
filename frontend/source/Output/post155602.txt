Highly abnormal graphic glitch on yosemite / retina: all white backgrounds appear pink <body> Suddenly, all white and transparent image backgrounds appear pink for me (but only on images, not on anything else that's renderered).  For example, the SE searchbar looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/50Doo.png" alt="searchbar"  Or the latest email from amazon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDfNj.png" alt="amazon"  Or the tag:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J8zAK.png" alt="tag"  The problem does only occur on HiDPI resolutions. If i launch Display Menu and switch to a normal resolution, the problem disappears.  This started after i had the decency to run Quartz Debug Tool to read the FPS of the OS X GUI. I clicked "Disable 2D Acceleration", but it froze my system and forced me to reboot.  Something must have gotten messed up. Anyone know how i can remedy this?  I tried a PRAM reset and deleting windowserver plist files. To no avail.  MBP Mid 2014 | 1TB | 2.8 GHz | 16 GB | Intel Iris Pro / NVidia GeForce GT 750M  <answer155687> After a night's sleep and some clear-headed research, i found the solution by running:  precodedefaults delete -g CGContextHighlight2xScaledImages /code/pre  ... which is a debugging feature that comes with Quartz Debug and which i had set there (and forgotten) by checking the "Color 1x artwork" option.
