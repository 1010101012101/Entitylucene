Cycle between Mac apps and VMware 7 using cmd+tab <body> I am trying to understand how I could switch back and forth in a productive manner when using a combination of VMware Fusion 7 and OS X El Capitan apps.  The keyboard shortcut that I am used to use thousands of times a day between Mac apps isbr kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd. I use it to cycle between apps, and would love to be able to do this to switch to other apps emwhen inside VMware Fusion/em.  What it currently does when I press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd from within VMware Fusion is that it will cycle through the windows of the virtual Windows machine, not take me out of the virtual machine and into my Mac apps again.  strongemThis is clicked in my Virtual Machine settings:/em/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJuVd.png" alt="enter image description here"  After looking online for a while, I found this tip, which emdoesn't work for me/em. This, although more subsequent, didn't seem to provide a workaround that would allow the user to use kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd to get out of VMware Fusion. This didn't help, and this didn't help either.   I also looked fruitlessly into the Windows 7 Control Panels for a way to disable cycling through windows in Windows with that shortcut, which didn't work.  <answer256531> In the same settings window, just below, is a dropdown menu that lets you choose which of the command-keys should represent the "Windows" key in your VM. The default seems to be both, which breaks all the native Mac shortcuts. Set it to one or the other, and all the usual Mac shortcuts work as long as you use the Command key that you didn't choose to represent the "Windows" key.  <answer268111> I had this same issue, which I resolved by enabling mission control (I had disabled it).  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock mcx-expose-disabled -bool FALSE &amp;&amp; killall Dock /code/pre  <comment302123> @user3439894 thanks for the edits! OS X is soon to be a discarded terminology and that works retroactively from what I understood <comment302124> OS X is not being discarded for versions 10.8~10.11 and macOS is not being applied retroactively.  It is just like when Apple dropped "Mac" from Mac OS X to OS X, versions 10.7 and earlier are Mac OS X. macOS is 10.12 and later. <comment302137> Ok, thanks. Maybe too early to tell? Like when Mac OS 9 was called "Classic" all of a sudden...
