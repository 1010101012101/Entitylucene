X11/XQuartz problem on 10.8.2 <body> On my Snow Leopard iMac, X11 is broken. I get:     dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_DGifGetLine Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/ ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO Expected in: /opt/local/lib/libGIF.dylib in /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/ ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO   when trying to run an OpenGL executable and http://codepad.org/HzjwS9wh when I try to run X11 directly.  I've reinstalled X11 from the original discs and the same thing happens, so I install XQuartz:  precode$ echo $DISPLAY /tmp/launch-XYA2Ul/org.macosforge.xquartz:0  $ launchctl list | grep xquartz -       0       org.macosforge.xquartz.startx /code/pre  This fails as well and I get http://codepad.org/NGowe0UR  I update to Mountain Lion, the problem persists, any ideas?  <answer65084> Take a look at this page.  It suggest trying codesudo ln -sf /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/ ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/libGIF.dylib /opt/local/lib/libGIF.dylib/code in Terminal.  (in your case; this exact command is not on the linked page)  <answer65086> installing XQuartz on ML solves the issue  <comment76432> installing ML solved the issue <comment76434> @nyiotis glad it's working now! Can anyone test this to make sure that this works, too?
