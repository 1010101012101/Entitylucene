Networking dead after a disk/permissions repair <body> After a strange string of events, I'm left with broken networking on my iMac (21" i3, 10.6).  It started on Fri. when a co-worker could not get jobs from this iMac, they were saying he didn't have permission. He rebooted the iMac and it then would not boot, stuck on the spinning wheel. Today I booted into the install disc and did a repair disk and repair permissions. It fixed a mismatched file count and mis-matched folder count, and the permissions.  Now when I try to access computers on the network or go online, it fails. Networking was set to manual address with DHCP, so I set it to DHCP and it gives me an 169 ipipa. Next I manually set the address and pinged the router and no route to host.  Conveniently I recently formatted my Time Machine disk on Thursday because it would not backup correctly and spotlight kept trying to index it. I was planning to re-backup with TM this week, but... well that didn't pan out. (it should still be on the formatted partition though).  Any suggestions?   <comment99226> Have you tried a [SMC reset](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964) yet?  You could also try using Network preferences to delete the Ethernet interface, restart, then reopen Network prefs and see if it is re-added. <comment99249> Yep, and also just tried SMC reset again. I also tried removing, restarting and adding the ethernet interface again.  If it helps I can ping `127.0.0.1`. Also after resetting SMC I am getting a prob. unrelated error: `/Library/Startupitems/.DS_Store has not been started because it does not have proper security settings.` <comment99262> It Seems to be working now! =) I went to lunch and when I came back all is well. Thanks @da4! <comment99307> hmmm ? what did you had for lunch ? :) <comment99327> Hot & Spicy noodle soup... it was delicious!
