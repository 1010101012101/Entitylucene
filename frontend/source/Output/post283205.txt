how to use hpn ssh with sftp command <body> I've installed hpn ssh using this command:  precodesudo port install openssh +hpn /code/pre  I want to transfer lost data (100GB at least) using sftp command terminal command.  I am wondering, is installing hpn ssh all I need to do to gain speed advantage with sftp command? After installing hpn ssh, my current upload speed is around 1.8MB (i have a line of 2.5 MB, so that is pretty close). Sadly, I didn't do a test before installing it. stupid me  Also, I noticed that transferring lots of individual files takes a lot more time than transferring 1 big file. Is zipping all the files and than sending that 1 zip the recommended way of transfering to remote host? I would prefer the option to not zip the files first, since zipping 100GB takes some time.  If you know a better solution to transfer large amount of data to remote host, I am open to it:)   <answer283232> MacPorts would install codesftp/code in code/opt/local/bin//code. You can test against the OS installed code/usr/bin/sftp/code.  The OS installed codezip/code uses codegzip compression/code by default but can be configured to use codebzip2/code (with the -Z option) which should give you better compression. I would split the 100GB of files into smaller archives.  Next, consider using codetar/code or codexar/code to create your archives. codetar/code with codexz/code should give you the best compression,codexz/code should already be installed by MacPorts. Of course these suggestions depend upon the tools available on the remote host.
