It would help us if you provided additional info, such as the types of devices, OS, etc. Please see [ask] for how to ask good questions that have a better chance at being answered. <comment321451> There's some missing info here.  It's helpful if you provide the OS version, the version of iPhoto, what you were doing when you discovered the problem, etc.  It's also helpful if you clarify if you are missing any pictures in those albums or not.
