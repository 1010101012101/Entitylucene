100% Delete U2 from iPhone? <body> I've looked up many ways on how to deal with the U2 songs on my phone, but they will not go away what ever I try.  The most common solution for this problem is to "Show all" music, go to the Music, click the iCloud download button to download it and then turn off "Show all" button again. Generally, this would work but in my situation, it says I haven't purchased the song and I can't download the song again. The song still plays when I click on it, but I can't swipe left to delete and I can't hide it. And yes, I am signed into iTunes. And no, it is not under my purchased section.  Is there any other way to rid of this song?   EDIT:  I'm running iOS7.1.2 on a iPhone5c And the song(s) aren't in my iTunes. It says I have zero items in my iTunes library and it isn't under my purchased songs. The song is emonly/em on my iPhone, and I can't redownload it (to delete it again) because then I'd have to purchase the song again.  Thanks.   <answer204333> The source of th songs is likely that they sync from iTunes on a PC or Mac.
