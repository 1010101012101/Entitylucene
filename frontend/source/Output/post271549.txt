Need assistance troubleshooting / learning launchctl and plist <body> I've always been a crontab guy. Recently I have decided to make the switch to Apple's launchd processes, and I am unable to get my first plist to run.  ol liThe codeplutil -lint/code command tells me the plist is formatted correctly. Actually, it outputs "OK"./li liI have run the bash script manually and confirmed that it properly operates when manually initiated./li liI have loaded the file using launchctl load and received the response "already loaded" on repeated attempts to do the same./li /ol  The problem must be in my PLIST definition.  Please help me spot the error.  I expect this to run with the following conditions:  ul liOnly while the user codejaredclemence/code is using the system/li liOnce immediately on login/li liEvery 15 minutes thereafter/li liChange Directory to code/Library/WebServer/Documents/medface//code before running the script./li /ul  The plist file is as follows:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;org.pediatricheartcenter.medface.crons&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;User&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;jaredclemence&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;/User/jaredclemence/runMedfaceSchedTasks.batch&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Library/WebServer/Documents/medface&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;900&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Notes:  ul liI have stored the file in code~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.pediatricheartcenter.medface.crons.plist/code/li liA previous version of the file used codeProgram/code instead of codeProgramArguments/code with a code&lt;string&gt;/code value instead of an array./li /ul  <answer271552> Launchd writes errors to system.log.  Using Console, I viewed the log. There, launchd told me that it did not like my codeUser/code key value.  I removed the User - jaredclemence key-value pair, and loaded the plist again. It then told me the batch program did not exist and I then noticed the error in the file path.  code/User/code should be code/Users/code  By removing the User setting and correcting the file path, I was able to fix the problem. Now, running codeps -ef | grep 'runMed'/code, I am able to see that the batch file is currently executing.  SUCCESS!  <comment341341> As an initial step in debugging, I'd suggest setting `keyStandardOutPath/key` and `keyStandardErrorPath/key` - I'd suggest `~/Library/Logs/org.pediatricheartcenter.medface.crons.stdout` (and `...stderr`) as that's the usual logging location for launch agents, but use whatever works for you. Add `echo` or `printf`s to the start and end of `runMedfaceSchedTasks.batch`, and see what the logs say after you `launchctl load` your `plist`. <comment341342> On further research, I discovered that launchd writes errors to the system.log.  I found the answer there! Thank you, John!
