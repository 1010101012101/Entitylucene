How to uninstall Jetbrains IDE? <body> When news version of Jetbrains IDE is installed previous version does not remove automatically. And currently there are no option (i.e. checkbox) to uninstall old version while installing.  How can one completely uninstall Jetbrains IDE (emlike IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, RubyMine, PhpStorm, CLion, AppCode, Rider, Data Grip etc./em) in OS X?  <answer231802> You can always uninstall the application completely using an app like ''AppCleaner'' (which removes all additional files of an app) and then install the new version.  <answer231822> I think that if you uninstall application using an app like "AppCleaner" you remote IDEA's config files. I don't sure.   I remove old version of IDEA to trash and copy new version to Application folder. That it. When i started first time a new version i choose use my previously settings and IDEA find it automatically.   I don't think that this is right way, but it works.   <answer287421> Move the .app file to the Trash, then manually delete the support folders listed in this IntelliJ support article:  ul li~/Library/Preferences//li li~/Library/Caches//li li~/Library/Application Support//li li~/Library/Logs//li /ul  <comment283065> Which versions did you upgrade from and to? <comment283261> From **IntelliJ IDEA CE 15** to **IntelliJ IDEA CE 2016**
