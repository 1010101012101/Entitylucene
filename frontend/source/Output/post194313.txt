Connect MacBook Pro 13 late 2012 SSD to SATA? <body> I have an SSD hard drive from MacBook Pro late 2012 (A1425). Is there a possibility to somehow connect it to a normal PC through SATA, PCIe etc.?  <answer194334> It appears to be possible.br According to this iFixit tear down, the A1425 SSD      It's a Samsung MZ-DPC2560/0A2 unit, rated at 3.3 volts and 2.39 amps. The serial number reads S0X5NYAC703706.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HW4F.jpg" alt="mSATA SSD"  Which appears to have an mSATA connector. There are lots of mSATA to whatever-you-may-need adapters on the market.  mSATA to micro SATA (1) (2)  mSATA USB enclosure  I haven't tried any of this myself, just did a search for it.  hr  This question 28 pin SSD adapter or enclosure needed for Late 2014 MBP points to certain incompatibilities to be aware of before buying.  <comment231738> what is "normal PC" ?
