Photos library not showing in iTunes <body> I can't see any longer any Photos library inside iTunes-Phone-photos.br Nor my full photos collection neither any newly created test library can be chosen in the option "Copy photos from"  I don't know if this issue is related to latest upgrade to macos 10.11.2 or to some old files cleaning I perform recently.
