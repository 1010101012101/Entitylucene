Can no longer ssh in to machine as git user after upgrading to Mavericks <body> I've got a server (just a mac mini) with two accounts:   ul limyRegularUser/li ligit /li /ul  (and some others)  The git's home directory is in code/Users/Shared/git/code.  Since upgrading to Mavericks, I can't ssh into codegit@myserver.com/code however, I can still ssh into codemyRegularUser@myserver.com/code.  When trying to ssh as the git user it immediately says "connection closed".   Sharing is enabled, and the Firewall is currently off.   Known problem? Easy fix?  <answer108649> Double check codegit/code is a user who's allowed to ssh in to this machine.  Go to codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Sharing/code and select codeRemote Login/code from the list on the left hand side of the pane.  Make sure Remote Login is turned on my checking the box next to it in the list (sounds like it is though, since you can ssh in as your own user account).  Make sure the right side of the pane either says codeAllow access for: All users/code or in the box below this option your codegit/code user appears in the list of allowed users. If it's not in the box below, press the code+/code button to find it in a list of users registered with the system and add it to the list.  Now make sure that code/Users/Shared/git/code is accessible to the codegit/code user.  Open Terminal and do:  precodecd /Users/Shared/git /code/pre  Use codels -la/code to view the permissions on the folder:  precode/Users/Shared/git [ian@iansimac] [20:22] &gt; ls -lah total 0 drwxr-xr-x   2 ian   wheel    68B  6 Nov 20:22 . drwxrwxrwt  14 root  wheel   476B  6 Nov 20:22 .. /code/pre  If code./code in the list shows the owner to be an account other than codegit/code or the permissions to be something that codegit/code can't use to access this directory you'll need to change them.  If codegit/code is the only user who should access this location, consider something like:  precodesudo chown -R git /Users/Shared/git sudo chmod 755 /Users/Shared/git /code/pre  If that doesn't lead to a solution, try watching your Console while attempting to ssh in to the machine as the codegit/code user to see what it says. You can filter console messages for codesshd/code to see just ssh-related messages:  precode11/6/2013 8:25:54.006 PM sshd: ian [priv][53178]: USER_PROCESS: 53189 ttys001 11/6/2013 8:26:37.217 PM sshd: ian [priv][53178]: DEAD_PROCESS: 53189 ttys001 11/6/2013 8:26:41.164 PM sshd: unknown [pam][53214]: in od_record_create(): failed: 13 11/6/2013 8:26:41.164 PM sshd: unknown [pam][53214]: in od_record_create_cstring(): failed: 13 11/6/2013 8:26:42.538 PM sshd: unknown [pam][53214]: in od_record_create(): failed: 13 11/6/2013 8:26:42.538 PM sshd: unknown [pam][53214]: in od_record_create_cstring(): failed: 13 11/6/2013 8:26:42.538 PM sshd: unknown [pam][53214]: in pam_sm_authenticate(): OpenDirectory - Unable to get user record. v11/6/2013 8:26:42.540 PM sshd[53212]: error: PAM: unknown user for illegal user foo from localhost via ::1 /code/pre  And failed login attempts look like the last line in the output above.  <comment127327> You're right. Only Admin's were allowed ssh access, and git was a regular user.
