Mac Mini Server running Mountain Lion (10.8.2) is freezing during boot (last line: IPv6 packet filtering initialized) <body> Starting in verbose mode (Cmd+V), the last line I see on the console is:  precodeIPv6 packet filtering initialized, default to accept, logging disabled /code/pre  This happens regardless of having an ethernet cable plugged in or not.  Starting in single user mode (Cmd+S), I can look around the filesystem, can remount it read write, everything looks ok. I can even start the network using:  precodemount -uw / launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.kextd.plist launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.notifyd.plist launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.configd.plist /code/pre  And ping systems on the local network.  When I exit the shell, the boot stops on the same spot.  Any ideas?  <answer93123> h2A possibility/h2  The lack of progress, beyond the firewall-related message, may be strongunrelated/strong to the firewall or networking. For example, these two lines from Intel Mac Pro Stuck on Gray Apple screen before OS load (2010-07-17):   precodeIPv6 packet filtering initialized, default to accept, logging disabled Jul 15 22:08:39 kextd[25]: kextd_watch_volumes: Couldn't set up diskarb sessions /code/pre  – that's not to say that your issue may be the same; just to encourage thinking beyond networking.   h2Preliminary advice/h2  Use Recovery OS:   ol liDisk Utility to verify the file system of the OS X startup volume/li liverify permissions of the OS X startup volume./li /ol  Then – if the file system is OK – get the full installer for OS X (at another Mac, if necessary); install to the outdated Mac.    <comment109289> Have you tried safe booting?
