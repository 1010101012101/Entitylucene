How can I get a user's associated Apple ID from the command line? <body> I'd like to be able to retrieve the current user's associated Apple ID from a shell script. My first guess was to do so using codedscl/code which I can get using my own user. But I'm not sure how reliable/consistent this method would be generally for any user.  codedscl . readpl /Users/[username] dsAttrTypeNative:LinkedIdentity appleid.apple.com:linked\ identities:0:full\ name/code  Are there any alternative ways to do this? Maybe reading a plist somewhere using codedefaults read/code?  <answer256050> AppleIDs aren't specifically 'associated' with any given local user account - if there is an AppleID signed in on the Mac you might try using mas:  https://github.com/argon/mas  Specifically the command codemas account/code should show you the currently logged-in AppleID.  <comment319111> ID associated with what? It's quite possible to have more than one ID, used for different purposes. <comment319698> That's actually not entirely true. Any user that has enabled iCloud services with their account has definitely created an association between their Apple ID and user account. There is also a specific iCloud feature that allows a user's password to be reset after first authenticating with their Apple ID. This would not be possible without some kind of association. <comment319816> All true, but that's an optional step that a local user may not have taken, which is what I was referring to. <comment321043> Ah I gotcha, makes sense.
