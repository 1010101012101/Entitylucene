Unix commands to overrun OS X Finder shortcut cmd-opt-esc <body> I need to temporarily block the sequence kbdcmd/kbdkbdopt/kbdkbdesc/kbd: I developed a formal examination test app for my students, and I need them to not get out of the test other than clicking a button in the test window.   BetterTouchTool accepts any shortcut except that (it seems to me, but I might make mistakes) I tried any combination, but always the forced quit window appears, as well as it happens in System Preferences  Keyboard  etc as suggested in "MacBook Pro, Yosemite: change Finder shortcuts".   I run Yosemite 10.10.5 and intend to stay with it until further upgrades will keep my Adobe suite working.  <answer250177> To get this to work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.  In the example below the key combination kbdcmd/kbdkbdopt/kbdkbdesc/kbd darkens the monitor.  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Disable Command Option Escape&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;disable_cmd_alt_esc&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::ESCAPE, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_COMMAND, ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN&lt;/autogen&gt;    &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the remapping. It should be listed at the beginning./li /ol  hr  You may refine the customized key code by adding a shortcut to brighten the monitor again to avoid a totally darkened screen and a helpless student sitting in front of it - unable to continue the test:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Disable Command Option Escape&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;disable_cmd_alt_esc&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::ESCAPE, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::ESCAPE, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_OPTION, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R, ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP&lt;/autogen&gt;    &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  In the first configuration each key combination (kbdcmd_l/r/kbdkbdalt_l/r/kbdkbdesc/kbd) darkens the screen. In the second configuration kbdcmd_l/kbdkbdalt_l/r/kbdkbdesc/kbd darkens and kbdcmd_r/kbdkbdalt_l/r/kbdkbdesc/kbd brightens the screen.  emKarabiner/em also allows you to define application-only key codes. By adding your app to /Applications/Karabiner.app/Contents/Resources/appdef.xml or to private.xml you can restrict the customized key code to your app's realm. Below the code&lt;identifier&gt;/code tag you have to add a line code&lt;only&gt;Your_App's_Name&lt;/only&gt;/code then.  hr  Depending on your app you probably have to disable some other shortcuts too: e.g. kbdcmd/kbdkbdQ/kbd. Additionally you may have to hide Karabiner in the menubar.  <comment310699> Tank you so much! I'll try ASAP! cmd-Q and others (like screen saver commands, in order not to have the questions copied and diffused on socials...) are already intercepted, but cmd-opt-escape was a stone wall... thank you again <comment310714> Works like magic! <comment310716> One more problem though, but i think I'll be able to solve it: the apple option force quit is still available, but I'll remove the menu and use a document window. Or Karabiner can disable that as well? Thanks anyway. MC <comment310719> @user185912 You can disable the shortcut with Karabiner. To remove the shortcut completely you have to hack the (AKAIK) Finder.app <comment310722> @user185912 Hmm just checked Karabiner again. Power Button support removed since 10.9. It may still be possible to disable a short cut containing the power button with Karabiner. This is the power button: ⎋ isn't it? <comment310754> @klanomath No, that’s Escape.
