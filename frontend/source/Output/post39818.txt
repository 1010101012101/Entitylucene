Is there a (free) graphical SSH file transfer client for Mac? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What&#39;s a good graphical SFTP utility for OS X?       I'm looking for an SSH client that includes drag and drop file transfer functionality. I'm aware of CyberDuck, but it's a bit pricey. I found one or two other programs, and they're not free. I need it for my computer science class this semester. (I'm technically ok using the Terminal, but some of my Mac using classmates are not.)   <answer39819> Apparently, I was wrong. Cyberduck is donation ware, so it will serve my purposes over the semester.   <answer39820> FileZilla can also do full SFTP (FTP over SSH) and it's free.  The downside obviously is it's not a very pretty application under OSX.  <answer39825> If you feel guilty about not donating to Cyberduck even though you've found it useful, Fugu is the daddy of SFTP clients for OS X... completely free and open source. The stable versions are PPC only, but there's a pre-release Intel version available.  <comment45015> Ah, I knew about that one too, didn't know it did SFTP. <comment45017> I would have also added Fugu, but its 10.6 and below only.
