Can I transfer purchased content from an iPhone to an authorised PC <body> Ok so on emcomputer 1/em, I have setup my iPhone, authorised emcomputer 1/em and downloaded some content from iTunes, and put this onto my iPhone.  I have just authorised emcomputer 2/em, can I transfer the data on my iPhone to emcomputer 2/em or do I need to re-download everything?  It seems a bit of a waste having to re-download everything (a couple of gigabytes) when all of the content is already sitting right there on my iPhone.  I'm not trying to do anything dodgy, just trying to transfer some purchased apps/music from a non-jailbroken iPhone to a properly authorised computer, why does Apple make this so difficult?  This is my first apple device so I am new to the whole apple ecosystem, can somebody help me carry out this simple task?
