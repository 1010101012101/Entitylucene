OSX Time Machine: deletion of backup folders <body> I saw this question and was hoping that someone could expand upon the chosen answer (which I understood):  ol liCan you codesudo mv/code Time Machine backup files as sudo from the trash to their original locations?  I have tried doing this as root to no avail (emoperation not permitted/em)./li liIf not, can you successfully coderm/code them via the trash via the terminal, faster than what the endless 'preparing to empty the trash' dialog suggests, and /li liIf you get the files back out of the trash can you tell if they are intact via disk utility (and how)/li liCan you force indexing on a Time Machine drive in the same way that you would a normal drive to rebuild the TM index?/li /ol  I realize that a single answer could clarify all of the above, but I wanted to include details to be clear on what I am asking.  Thanks for any help.
