cmd+del acts like opt+cmd+del <body> For some unknown reason my Mac deletes permanently when I hit kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌫/kbd. Normally kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌫/kbd is to move to Trash and kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌫/kbd is the one to delete for good. Can't figure out how to make it work 'normal' again?  <answer288105> Probably your trash folder is broken. There are a lot of solutions of this problem in the internet, but in short you may need to remove your trash folder codesudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/code and let Finder create a new one by restarting your Mac.  <comment363753> What happens if you drag-n-drop something to Trash icon in Dock? <comment363759> Unfortunately the same behaviour. In both cases I get the warning msg saying that the deletion will be permanent. <comment363760> Also strange because I didn't installed any new sw. It was good yesterday. <comment363762> In System Restore / Modifer Keys I tried to Restore to Defaults, but since I haven't change any keys, nothing happens too. <comment363764> "Unfortunately the same behaviour." - that means you have a problem with a Trash, not with hot keys <comment363765> Try this one: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3776862?tstart=0 <comment363768> Thanks, that thread solved the issue. More precisely the Terminal cmd: sudo rm -rvf /Users/{YOURHOME}/.Trash; killall Finder
