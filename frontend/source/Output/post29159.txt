Can anyone recommend good third party iOS email clients (especially regarding signature support)? <body> Can anyone recommend an iOS email client (Exchange/ActiveSync or IMAP... preferably both) that supports really sweet email signatures?  Our company email signature has an official format that has a base64 encoded image and a standardized font/color.  Please, throw me some suggestions!  <answer32555> h2Moxier/h2  This is an email client which supports Exchange ActiveSync in the AppStore. But I'm not sure it supports sweet email signatures.  <answer44393> strongSparrow/strong is now available for the iPhone, and it supports IMAP.   The app description does not mention exchange, and it specifically says that there's no POP support, but being that it's such a popular mail client, I figured it's worth mentioning.   supDisclaimer: I've never used it either on the Mac or on iOS/sup  <answer50204> Outlook Mail is pretty good and supports signatures.  The problem I've run into is that it doesn't support saved searches (As far as I can Tell) or unread search.  <answer80545> Try "Touchdown" for iOS, available in the App Store.   <answer81188> try Mail+ for Outlook by iKonic Apps...best email client out there  <comment33562> This is related, but not really duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23692/hyperlinked-ios-mail-signature-any-ideas <comment50446> Care to explain what makes Sparrow a good client? <comment50476> @ivoFlipse - hey, long time no speak. as I said in my answer, I havent used it. But, I've heard good things about it. <comment50486> And what were these good things you heard? I believe you, but your answer contains no information on which I can base whether Sparrow is a good app or not. <comment50490> @Ivo, I'm going to go take a mother look. :-) <comment57662> Welcome to Ask Different, Tom! Thanks for posting answer! Can you please add a link to Outlook Mail? Thank you!
