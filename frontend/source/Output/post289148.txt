Change url on safari search <body> I'm trying to move from chrome to safari, but there is something which I'm not able to do so far.  I work with Jira, and when I try to browse a ticket for a known project, I can't edit the url to browse a specific ticket  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Lkvo.png" alt="enter image description here"  For example this ticket, If I want to go browse strongVSGN-146/strong, and previously I was working on VSGN-145 (known project), on Chrome I start typing "vsgn" and then I move to the end of the url and I can change the 5 for a 6.  If I try to do that in safari, the end of the line is "... - JIRA" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HOibq.png" alt="enter image description here"  So the question is, is there a way to edit the url instead of the site description on safari? Btw, I'm using the version 10.1.1  Thank you in advance.  <answer289164> To show the full URL in what Safari calls the em'Smart Search Field',/em make sure the following is set in strongPreferences/strong:  ul liGo to Safari  Preferences (kbd⌘/kbd+kbd,/kbd)/li liSelect the strongAdvanced/strong tab/li liCheck the box "Smart Search Field: [✓] Show full website address"/li /ul  Now you can edit the full URL by hand.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uZ7U2.png" alt="Smart Search Field Option"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUhA6.png" alt="Smart Search Field"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IKge9.png" alt="Editing URL in Smart Search Field"  hr  h2EDIT:/h2  Notice how the URL is now displayed with first before the title?  Just the opposite of the OP's screenshot.  Now typing the right arrow kbd►/kbd will go to the end of the URL not the title as the URL is first.  (The URL and the Title are now swapped)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KATqP.png" alt="Show full site"  <comment365282> Hi bjbk, thank you for the answer, but that will only work if I am in the same domain. Indeed, it works event without the "Show full website address". <comment365302> Works for me from the home page.  Maybe I'm missing something in your question.  Updated answer with another screenshot.  Cheers
