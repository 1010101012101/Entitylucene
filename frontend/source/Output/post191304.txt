USB drive appearing as two different devices <body> I just plugged an empty flash drive into my computer, and it thinks there are two drives - the flash drive I expected, and a small CD-ROM drive.  Here is the relevant section of output from running codediskutil list/code in Terminal:  precode/dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 GB     disk3    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 NEW VOLUME              1.0 GB     disk3s1 /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:        CD_partition_scheme                        *3.6 MB     disk4    1:              CD_ROM_Mode_1                         2.9 MB     disk4s0 /code/pre  The main volume is empty, as expected.  The CD-ROM 'drive' contains 3 files, none of which can be deleted (I tried remounting the volume in read-write mode, and it didn't work):  precode-rwxr-xr-x  1 clintmcgill  staff    4836 May  9  2009 autorun.dat -rwxr-xr-x  1 clintmcgill  staff  266752 May  9  2009 autorun.exe -rwxr-xr-x  1 clintmcgill  staff      49 May  9  2009 autorun.inf /code/pre  Now, I can see two possible explanations for this:  ol liThis is some harmless leftover junk from the original manufacturer, meant to start up some program that would attempt to be helpful on Windows (such as a disk encryption utility, etc)./li liThis is malware meant to target Windows./li /ol  How can I tell which one it is, and, if possible, how can I get rid of that second 'drive' so that I have all the memory available and avoid problems when I connect this to Windows?  <answer212456> 1 the CD ROM states in MS DOS language file names dat “data” exe “program” inf “auto-run” stat is required to install drives that on microsoft machines annoyingly are third party and is a physical chip harddrive wired onboard and not a flash based partition and that’s the reason it cannot be deleted it’s to prevent the manifacturer getting complaints over not working when connected to a microsoft machine  2 still nervous bout the malware driver issue run a scan with antivirus on an old recycled microsoft laptop and it will on connection install drivers  I have years back been around forums for the same reason with a 16GB drive that i picked up from trash it to scan it with norton on a microsoft dell laptop finally hurrae it was launching a device driver install and the free space was done there with “format harddrive” then with diskutilty an still taking that "piece of trash” up to the library door  <comment227194> As you state, you have no data as yet, what result did you get when you reformatted the drive in **Disk Utility** to a MS compatible format? <comment227196> @bjbk Disk Utility sees it as a completely separate drive - when I go to the Erase tab it says 'No disc drive is available to erase the disc.' <comment227197> Any insight from the Manufacturer's website about reformatting?  What other research have you done?  Would love to be of further assistance if we can.  More info on what you have tried could be useful. <comment227198> @bjbk I'd love to tell you that, but either this drive was made without the manufacturer's name printed on it, or it's been worn off.   The best I can tell you is the USB Serial Number is '1ed217656df557' <comment227199> OK, a quick search on Ask Different for [force reformat usb drive](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=force+reformat+usb+drive) came up with [this possible solution](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125965/unable-to-format-erase-hard-drive/182147?s=3|0.0936#182147).  You have nothing to loose. <comment227229> @bjbk I tried that with no luck.  The CD 'device' just gave errors when I tried to flush data to it, and doing it to the regular flash memory device didn't change anything about the other one.
