Can I hotlink to a photo in an album in iCloud? <body> Can I hotlink to a photo in an album in iCloud? I need to insert the direct URLs into spreadsheets.  <comment336310> Use Google photos instead. It does this. <comment336528> [Duplicate question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/235781/88313) but it doesn't have an accepted answer yet. <comment336577> Yes it's a duplicate... trying to close. - Seems like I can't. Just delete... hm... <comment336578> I tried the normal sharing icon, I tried googling, I tried looking out my window to see if any Apple employees would pass by and tell me/fix the problem. Anyhows, I guess that using Google photos or some other service is the only good workaround. I did try Dropbox but they "highjack" the shared links (it seems to be possible by adding dl=1 at the end though but I doubt this is really a well supported feature)
