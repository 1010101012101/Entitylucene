How do I install hp officejet printer 4610/4620 onto my apple 4th generation IPad? <body> I have an HP Officejet 4610/4620 attached to an OSX machine, and I would like to print to it from my 4th generation iPad Apple - how can I achieve this?  <answer84900> This should be as simple as downloading and installing emHandyprint/em (previously known as emAirPrint Activator/em) which will share out an OSX printer on your wireless network as if it was an Airprint one.
