Can I customize the ToolStrip to include Automator scripts? <body> I want to include special actions in Finder such as showing or not showing hidden files.   emmost/em of the time I want to have a clean clutter free system, however there are times I need to dig into the library or other system locations.   It would be nice to have a way to use the touch bar to create a clutter free Finder experience that can be enabled/disabled.   Is it possible to include scripts in the Toolbar feature of Finder or any other app?   <answer272284> BetterTouchTool has an alpha version which supports the Touch Bar.br You can use the ‘Open Application / Script / File’ action in BTT to launch your Automator app.  <comment344788> What is the ToolStrip?
