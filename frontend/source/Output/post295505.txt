When launching `screen`, "normal" bash environment isn't setup <body> My typical login looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RITjN.png" alt="normal login"  But when I start codescreen/code, I get just a bare bash environment - no environment variables, aliases, etc:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5NY5x.png" alt="&lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; has default bash prompt"  Why is that happening, and what can I do to fix it?  <answer295508> Was pointed to code/etc/screenrc/code by a friend. It doesn't exist on macOS.  So I copied a working code/etc/screenrc/code to code.screenrc/code and uncommented the following line:  precode# make the shell in every window a login shell shell -$SHELL /code/pre  <answer295509> codescreen/code opens a new, independent emshell/em.    If you want your prompts, aliases, environment variables and such, you will need to copy them over the code.screenrc/code file from your code.bashrc/code or code.bash_profile/code  For more info, you can refer to the man page (codeman screen/code) or the documentation
