Hope it can help you  <comment267920> There's really no reason to delete the Photos app. Messing with system apps could possibly make your Mac run into problems later and really offers no benefit, aside from clearing up a little storage. <comment267921> Thanks, but I'm not here to ask about wether this is wise to do or not. I don't want it in my applications folder and I am here to find out how to do that. <comment267931> OP said AppZapper didn't work. <comment267933> Have you looked at [this thread?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/211922/how-do-i-remove-or-disable-the-photos-app-in-el-capitan?rq=1) How do I remove or disable the Photos app in El Capitan? <comment267954> @bjbk thank you! <comment268062> oh sorry... idk why i didn't see it... greetings
