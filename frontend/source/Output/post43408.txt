How can I open a file with extension DAA on Mac? <body> How do I open a file with a .daa file extension on my Mac? Is there a Mac program that will convert it to an ISO image?  <answer43438> According to this reference, .daa is an extension related to the PowerIso application. This 2008 MacWorld article suggests an open source application - DAA Converter for OS X. The app page states:     DAA Converter is a free utility for strongconverting DAA &amp; GBI disk images   to ISO format/strong so they can be accessed on your Mac.       DAA Converter is a native GUI application which wraps the command-line   tool, DAA2ISO/GBI2ISO, by Luigi Auriemma.  strongIt runs on Mac OS X 10.3   Panther or later./strong   I don't have any .daa files to test with, so I can't verify that this utility works. However, it's a GPL freeware app, so it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot.
