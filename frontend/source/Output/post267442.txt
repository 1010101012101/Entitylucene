I'm using MS Office 365 and Outlook 2016 the Com Add in for iCloud has disappeared <body> I have deleted iCloud and re-installed but the iCloud add-in is still not visible on Outlook 2016. I have checked File  Option  Add-in but it doesn't exist (not even as disabled.)  Any suggestions appreciated.  <comment335560> Welcome to Ask Different.
