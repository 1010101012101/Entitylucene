How to enable Normal Scrolling on MacBookPro 10.8.3? <body> Small or incremental scrolling on my MBP OSX 10.8.3 using an external mouse is extremely slow to a crawl. How do I configure my mouse to a Normal Scroll mode where every scroll is the same and creates fast scrolls in the window?  <answer99245> Try increasing the scroll speed in System Preferences  Mouse  Scrolling Speed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O8iQx.png" alt=""  <comment116682> What mouse are you using? <comment116804> Logitech Corded Mouse M500 <comment116805> Unfortunately, I've already visited this option. yet every incremental scroll only scrolls the page by pixels.. Only large scrolls are normal. <comment116840> Okay. Try the [Logitech Control Center](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/3129) (under Downloads). Then once it is installed, go to System Prefs  Logitech Control Center, select your mouse, then go to the General preferences and see if changing the scroll setting there fixes that.
