35 "Flash Player" in DiskUtility <body> from codesudo diskutil list/code I get 35 of these  precode/dev/disk35 (disk image): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +17.9 MB    disk35 1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk35s1 2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            17.9 MB    disk35s2 /code/pre  codesudo diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk35/code gives a hopeful codeUnmount of all volumes on disk35 was successful/code, but if I list it is still there.  Any idea why this happens? and how to get rid of these Flash Player images?  Cheers, Roberto  <answer234765> The disk "Flash Player" is still attached to the filesystem. Go into code/Volumes/code, and you should see it there. There are two ways to proceed, the GUI method, or the command line method. Use whichever you are most comfortable with.  GUI: Navigate to code/Volumes/code and press kbdâŒ˜ Command/kbd+kbdE/kbd. This will eject the volume.  CLI: codediskutil eject /dev/diskx/code, in this case codedisk35/code. This will also eject the volume.  hr  The difference between codediskutil unmountDisk/code and codediskutil eject/code is that codeunmountDisk/code only ceases disk-IO between the disk and the filesystem, but keeps it attached so that it can be mounted later. However, codeeject/code effectively 'removes' it from the filesystem, and remounting it may involve physically reconnecting the disk. Think of them as "stand by" and "shutdown" respectively on a computer.  From codeman diskutil/code:     diskutil eject      Eject a disk.  Media will become offline for the purposes of being a data store for file systems or being a member of constructs such as software RAID or direct data.  Additionally, removable media will become eligible for safe manual removal; automatically-removable media will begin its physical (motorized) eject sequence.   whereas     diskutil unmountDisk      Unmount an entire disk (all volumes).  Force will force-unmount the volumes (less kind to any open files; see also umount (8)).  You should specify a whole disk, but all volumes of the whole disk are attempted to be unmounted even if you specify a partition.   <comment287040> nothing shown in `/Volumes` except `Macintosh HD` <comment287042> still `diskutil eject /dev/diskx` worked. <comment287044> A little bit of research and live experimenting shows that even though the disk image may be unmounted, it can still be seen in `diskutil list`. Interestingly, the same behaviour can be observed in hard disks that have been "ejected". Both unmounted/ejected media can still be remounted through `diskutil mountDisk`, which has me thinking they're still "attached" to a `/dev` node.
