Mac Mini 2011: Blurry font at native resolution on Mountain Lion <body> I have a Mac Mini 2011 with the Radeon 6630m connected to a Samsung 226BW through HDMI to DVI and I'm dual-booting Mountain Lion and Windows 7.  My problem is on OSX, the font seems a bit off and I can't use it for long until I start getting strain on the eyes. On win7 everything looks clear as it should.  Things I've tried:  ol liMessing with the font smoothing values, went 0-4 relogging every time with no success./li liEnabling HiDPI resolutions, which only showed me a few low resolutions with HiDPI. The funny thing is switching to any of those lower hidpi resolutions makes everything look crisper than it does using the monitor's native resolution./li /ol  I'm starting to think it's a problem with the monitor's driver in OSX but please let me know what else I could try if anyone has any ideas!  <comment93242> Are you absolutely sure you're using the monitor's native resolution? (Monitors don't have drivers themselves, so that's not the issue.)
