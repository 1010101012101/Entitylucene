802.1X OSX Yosemite not Authenticating <body> Trying to connect to my schools wireless network, but the 802.1X Authentication wont finish. It also says that I have a self-designated IP.  <comment211997> No error message? <comment211999> Nope, it just keeps loading @KevinGrabher <comment212001> Nothing in the system log files? <comment212002> How would I get that? @Garex <comment212018> The self-assigned IP says you are connected to the router but do not have Internet access. <comment212050> How can I resolve this? Why is it not authenticating/taking forever(literally) to authenticate 802.1X @Buscarì›ƒ <comment212074> you can not, but you can talk to the IT person.
