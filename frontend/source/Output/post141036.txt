Convert iPhone 4 30-pin connector to iPhone 5 Lightning connector <body> I need a 30-pin (iPhone 4) to Lightning (iPhone 5) with a long cable (1m) between the 2 ends.  Does such thing exist?  <answer141037> Apple sells a Lightning to 30-pin adapter.  If you're okay with 3rd-party solution, 30-pin female to Lightning adapter  could be closer to what you need, but there could be compatibility issues.  The kit includes this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQr55l.jpg" alt="image of 30-pin female to Lightning adapter"  to which you can add Lightning 1m-extension cable which should get you from Lightning to 30-pin.  As far as I can see there is no single cable that does what you want.  <comment166173> Thanks Paul- I wanted a female 30pin end with a longer cable that ends in a lightning end. This is for a car ausio system that has a 30pin male end but I need to stretch the phone from there to the dashboard wher I can see the display (the connector is in a central console between the two front seats. Any suggestions? <comment166174> The Apple connector is pathetically short. If it had a metre long cable between the 2 ends it would be perfect for my needs <comment166177> I've updated my answer with a possible solution
