Spotlight integration of Thunderbird 24.1.0 in Maverick <body> I have Thunderbird 24.1.0 running on Maverick and it works nicely.   I am wondering about the integration of spotlight and thunderbird.  I can search in spotlight for my emails, which is what I want, but the preview in limited to the name of the .mozeml file and nothing else is shown (in Mail.app .eml files, the content of the email is previewed as expected).   Is this expected behaviour? If no, is there anything I have to do to get the indexing of the bodies of the mails and the preview of the email?
