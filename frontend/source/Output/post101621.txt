Macbook Pro sleep wake problem <body> I have a 2012 13 inch Macbook Pro and I close the lid at night before bed and when I wake up sometimes I open the lid and it make a weird noise, and show a black and white picture with a progress bar, it only take like 5 seconds. And then I see the password dialog, but it still frozen and I can't type my password or move the cursor or anything for about 1~2 minutes.  And this I had it plugged in the charger the whole time since the day before.  Sometimes it keep stuck on the login screen for so long that it sleeps again.  Normally I just open the lid and it wakes up instantly and I'm ready to go.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrLMT0GVq5Q  <comment119712> Go to your Console and type "wake reason" and tell what it shows before and after the time stamp <comment119714> The weird noise is probably the hard drive waking up, and it takes longer to get back operational because it went into deep sleep/hibernation instead of regular sleep. Though (realizing I haven't used one) I would think that the status bar would stay on the screen until it's actually ready to be used.
