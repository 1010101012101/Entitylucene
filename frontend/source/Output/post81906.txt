I want to upgrade my mac but not my microsoft package - can i transfer it? <body> I'm going to get a new machine but would rather invest my pennies in new illustrator software than Office - can I transfer my MS package?  Thanks  <comment94447> How did you install Office on your current/old system? Do you still have the install discs? <comment94498> Which version of Office:Mac?  Do you have the physical media, or just the software key and a download link?
