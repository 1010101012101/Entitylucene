Can I send iMessage from my phone number on a phone without a SIM card? <body> I have a phone (phone 1) which works completely normally. Sends texts and iMessage from my phone number. It has a SIM card.   I want to do the same on a second phone that doesn't have a SIM card. It can send iMessage but from my regular (non-iCloud) email. How can I make it send iMessage from my phone number instead? I assume this is possible because my macbook can do this. And it used to work perfectly before I installed a software update.
