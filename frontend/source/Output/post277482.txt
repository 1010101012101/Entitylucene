Does disabling "System Integrity Protection" in El Cap cause shutdown/restart/logout issues? <body> I have an older M-Audio Firewire audio interface that I use with my Mid 2011 Mac Mini. It's running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6. M-Audio never made drivers for this version of OS X, so I have to disable "System Integrity Protection" for the audio interface to work. I do this by booting to recovery  Terminal: codecsrutil disable/code then rebooting normally.   However, I have an issue where I cannot logout, restart or shutdown "cleanly." What I typically do is run the codesudo restart now/code command to reboot, or codesudo pkill loginwindow/code to log out. EDIT: What I mean here is strongOS X (El Cap) is getting "stuck" (just hanging indefinitely) when I try to either a.)logout b.)restart or c.)shutdown. It just does not work, so I use terminal commands to force it, but I want to stop having to do this./strong   Could this issue be related to disabling SIP? EDIT: I have disabled SIP, no change. They are not related.   <comment349240> It shouldn't be, but it might. Try reenabling SIP. If it fixes the problem, you've found it, if not try looking for other causes. <comment349275> Thanks, Noah. I'll try it and report back... <comment349325> Disabling SIP did not help my issue. Any ideas on what else to try? <comment349327> My only other thought would be to reinstall the OS and then try again <comment349329> Oh man, that's too much! Surely there's something else I try... <comment349525> Ok, so removed my answer for not being an actual answer. My first question: do you _always_ experience the described problems? Or just sometimes? When macOS `hangs` it is usually because one or more specific processes are at fault. Could you check the output of `ps aux` in terminal if there might be any processes take a large amount of CPU or MEM usage? <comment349527> Thank you. Yes, always. I will try the `ps aux` command... <comment349528> You could also try holding down the command-key when shutting down or logging out.This will skip the pop-up confirmation window you usually would get. So holding down the command-key would help prevent the very rare case in which this window might be what is actually at fault. <comment349531> Finally, as a first try.. try to search the `ps aux` output for any M-audio related processes (you could use `ps aux | grep -i whatyouarelookingfor` to ease your search). Kill these processes and execute a regular reboot. Did that help? It might be macOS gets stuck on trying to close these processes if they aren't actually compatible anymore.. <comment349805> What should I be looking for? I tried this   `bash-3.2# ps aux | grep -i M-Audio root                76   0.0  0.0   659960   3764   ??
