HTML5 in Safari 9.0.1 (11601.2.7.2) - `html5test.com <body> According to html5test.com, Safari now supports HTML5. I am specifically interested in the HTML5 tag parameter coderequired/code.  However, when I add the coderequired/code parameter to my form, Safari ignores it. I have tested the page with FireFox and it works.  So, does Safari support HTML5 or not?  <answer213520> Safari does not support this attribute, you need to use JavaScript. This page contains a hacky solution, that should add the desired functionality:  http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/forms/constraintvalidation/#toc-safari  <answer213550> Safari does support HTML5 and does support form validation, however support for 'required' in Safari on OS X and iOS is 'partial'.     Partial support refers to lack of notice when form with required fields is attempted to be submitted.   supSource: caniuse.com/#search=required/sup  Implementation is off-topic here, but feel free to search for solutions on Stack Overflow.
