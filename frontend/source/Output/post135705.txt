How to create a smart folder for files created in the last 5 minutes <body> I have a camera setup were the camera automatically takes pictures every x seconds and these images are saved in a directory called 'Images'. Now I want to create a smart folder that looks in 'Images' and only lists images that were added in the last 5 minutes. When creating a smart folder, I see only the option the list files from the last day.  strongHow can I create a smart folder that lists only files created in the last 5 minutes?/strong  In other words, I want to create a smart folder using non-standard options.  <answer135881> A 'Smart folder' is in principle a XML formatted file that, when opened, returns a Spotlight search result. To create a Smart folder you can add multiple search terms by pressing the code+/code (or kbdalt/kbdcode+/code). For example, you can choose to only return files that where created in the last 7 days. Although there is a profusion of search terms, some are still missing (like searching within the last 5 minutes).  The commandline version of Spotlight is codemdfind/code (manual). Although harder to use, codemdfind/code commands are more flexable than the Smart folder/Spotlight alternative. You can, for example, search for files that were created in the last 5 minutes like this:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemFSCreationDate &gt; "$time.now(-300)"' /code/pre  Or were changed in the last 10 minutes:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemFSContentChangeDate &gt; "$time.now(-600)"' /code/pre  Fortunatly Smart folders support the codemdfind/code command! To use codemdfind/code search commands do the following:  ol liGo to Finder and press kbdCommand/kbdkbdF/kbd to start a new Smart folder./li liIn the search-items bar you can select 'Other...' from the drop down menu. Search for 'Raw query' and add it to your search terms/li liNow enter your codemdfind/code search query in the empty text field  precodekMDItemFSCreationDate &gt; $time.now(-600) /code/pre/li liSave your search and you are done./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGbvj.png" alt="Other dropdown menu smart folder" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qPIeN.png" alt="Smart folder raw query"  <comment160900> Don't know about smart folder, but you can always make a regular folder and have a script running in background which makes symlinks to 5 newest images.
