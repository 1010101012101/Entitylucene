How can I share a Time Capsule connection? <body> I have my Time Capsule connected via wi-fi, and I want to share that connection with my other 2 computers via their ethernet. So basically, share the current wifi connection that my Time Capsule has and make sure that my other 2 computers can connect to the internet via that Time Capsule's ethernet ports. Thanks in advance.  <answer1441> Yes you can. Since the Time Capsule is an Airport Extreme with an internal hard drive it's relatively easy to convert it into a wireless to wired bridge assuming you already have it set to hook up to the wireless network.  ol liOpen up Airport Utility and start Manual Setup on your Time Capsule/li liGo to the Internet section/li liUnder Internet Connection be sure Connection Sharing is set to Bridge Mode/li /ol  If bridge mode is turned on it will share the connection and essentially act like a switch.
