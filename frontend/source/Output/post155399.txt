External Apple USB keyboard, Shift+Tab and Command+Shift+Tab doesn't work <body> I have an aluminum Apple USB keyboard plugged into my MacBook Pro (Late 2011). kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd works fine to switch applications. But kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd doesn’t! The same shift key works to capitalize letters, so what on earth is going on?  This is the case with both the left and right side, and combinations of the two. kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab /kbdresults in emno/em action--it's not that the shift is being ignored, it kills the combo (i.e. kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd does not bring up the application switcher, and pressing it while the application switcher is up results in no movement, not movement to the right). Furthermore, kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd works emfine on the built-in keyboard!/em  And while I was typing this I remembered something else: kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd doesn’t work either (e.g. to move to the previous form field) But it works fine on the MBP built-in keyboard!  What am I missing?  <answer175364> Sounds like a hardware problem based on the comments. Until you can try a new one, you could get the same action by using use kbdCmd/kbd+kbdTab/kbd (holding down kbdCmd/kbd but just tapping kbdTab/kbd) to bring up the switcher, and then use the arrow keys to go back and forward.  Or possibly the Karabiner keyboard customizing app will let you remap the left shift to something else.  <comment206457> For me Cmd+Shift+TAB works but not Control+Shift+TAB (with Caps-Lock as control). Really weird! <comment206589> If you look at what keys the Mac "thinks" are pressed using the Keyboard Viewer, what do you see?  (In System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard, turn on "Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar", then at the top of the screen, choose "Show Keyboard Viewer" from the menu item that has just appeared.) <comment206652> It catches caps-lock and shift but nothing when also pressing tab. <comment207440> Maybe try [Key Codes](http://manytricks.com/keycodes/) to see what codes are being sent by each keyboard. May not fix it but may narrow down the analysis.
