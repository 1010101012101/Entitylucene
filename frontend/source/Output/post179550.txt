How can I print a path with a home directory replaced by ~ in terminal? <body> How can I print a path in Terminal with the home folder path replaced by a ~?  precodepwd /Users/denz/projects/coolApp /code/pre  But I want to something like this  precode~/projects/coolApp /code/pre  <answer179552> Here's a function:  precodepwdr () {   pwd | sed s,$HOME,~, } /code/pre  Add this function to a profile file and use codepwdr/code.  hr  In codebash/code you can also use parameter expansion and avoid the call to codesed/code by using the rather magically looking  precodeecho ${PWD/~/\~} /code/pre  The code${...}/code expression can be used anywhere a shell variable can be used as well, the codeecho/code is just for demonstration purposes.  <comment212970> Of course this may fail in corner cases, like if there is a directory called `/Users/denz/foo/Users/denz` which this would translate to `~/foo/~`. <comment213045> @NateEldredge Made a small change to the `sed` way, the corner case should work ok now with both options.
