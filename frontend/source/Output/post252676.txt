OS X 10.11.6 can not update iTunes 12.5.1, app store problem <body> As shown in picture, app store tell me to update iTunes 12.5.1, but in updates installed list, you can see I have already installed iTunes 12.5.1. But actually, my iTunes version is still 12.4.3 Now, I click the update button of iTunes, then after download completed, nothing will install, and return this page to wait update. My mac os x system is 10.11.6  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ymI2r.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fix it? Thanks  <answer252694> I had the same issue. I ran Disk Utility - First Aid and it found a buch of issues. After that I was able to download iTune 12.5.1 properly.  If that doesn't work, you can always download it directly from: http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/  <answer253076> If this doesn't work, all I did was download iTunes from the Apple site and installed it via the new DMG file.  <comment314528> Thanks, I download it directly from website and install, works for me.
