Selective ringtone restore from older backup <body> I recently got iPhone 5S and was able to restore data from iCloud back up. However, my iTunes backup was more recent, and When I did sync from iTunes, I got the latest data too. So all good. But, my not-so-latest iCloud back up had a custom ringtone that I had created, which was removed when I synced from iTunes.  Is there a selective restore of the custom ringtone that I could now pull from the iCloud back up?

I guess you'll have to remake it if you don't already have it on your Mac somewhere. Next time, before swapping phones, use iTunes. Sync, Backup, initialise new phone, Restore.
