SMS messaging not available on iPad - how to enable? <body> I am unable to text to anyone other then other iOS users...  I want to enable "allow SMS messaging when iMessage is unavailable" but it is not an option - how do I set this up?  <answer212475> You need an SMS-capable device, like an iPhone or iPad with a SIM &amp; text messaging plan.  See Use Messages with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch   If you have a capable device &amp; service plan, make sure SMS is switched on in Settings  Messages   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/atnaN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment256540> Please don't use an ALL-CAPS title.
