How to share a folder and only this folder? <body> I have a Mavericks installed Mac, and want to share a folder called codeData/code which placed in  code/Users/Sato/Data/code with another windows 7 PC.  So I followed a post to setup shared folder, and it works. But I have one problem.   Not only the folder I want to share is being shared, but also my code$HOME/code folder, code/Users/code and code//code are all being shared.   <answer130064> You can set up what folders are shared by:  ul liopen System Preferences/li liclick on Sharing/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BPnP9.png" alt="sharing"  using the kbd+/kbd and kbd-/kbd you can add or remove folders to be shared.  <comment152284> You followed **a post**, that makes no sense. Please add the source and we can at least see the steps you've done.
