How to uninstall Xcode IDE without completely removing the dev tools <body> I wanted to enable the developer libraries in Mac (RoR, Perl, gcc etc.) so I installed Xcode. I am only interested in these command line tools and will not be using Xcode (or other GUI tools with Mac and iPhone developer bells and whistles that are part of the SDK) at all, as I generally like to use a text editor and the command line.   How do I remove just those IDE tools while still keeping my programming environment intact? I'd rather reclaim the disk space. I have Xcode 3.2 installed.  <answer38204> My guess is that you'll have to delete things manually. You should be able to delete the Applications and Documentation folders, and the two iPhone platform folders if you aren't interested in that at all. That will get rid of most of the size (7.5GB out of 11.1GB for me, but I'm pretty sure some of that gets downloaded when you open Xcode and another 2GB was project files).  You emmight/em be able to delete the /Developer folder completely, but definitely have a backup before you try because the compilers might use files stored in there.  <answer38205> I am almost positive the gcc tools need Xcode to properly run as well.  <answer54482> As of recent releases of Xcode 4 you can now get the command-line tools as a separate download and installer - it's a much smaller download too: http://developer.apple.com/downloads.  You'll want to uninstall an existing Xcode install with the command:  precode$ sudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all /code/pre  before installing the command-line only tools.  <comment59231> Nah, I use GCC without XCode. <comment62403> Also, it's "Xcode" - sorry: so many people see "Xcode" then write "xCode", "XCode" and whatever else.. <comment274745> I'm running El Capitan and there's no /Developer folder on my machine. (Which means no /Developer/Library, and a search also fails to turn up any `uninstall-devtools` utility.)
