Seeking OS X app recommendation: instant text entry <body> I'm looking for an app (or script) that does this:  ol liI hit a global shortcut key chord./li liA one-line text entry box appears./li liI enter a line of text and hit ENTER./li liThe text is saved somewhere, perhaps as a plaintext file on the local filesystem./li liI'm looking at the same screen I was before step 1, without any more clicks, keys, or delays./li /ol  That's it.  The purpose is simply to have a muscle-memory way of recording a very brief thought.  Please don't suggest a solution that involves a heavy app with lots of features -- for the sake of this OP, that fails the requirements.  This description sounds a lot like Twitter, and given that many OS X Twitter clients could be configured to fulfill this behavior, I don't want a Twitter client.  <answer37855> The QuickJot feature of Shovebox does this. Yojimbo also has a hot key feature, but the input box will be a little more complex. Both of these will store "files" within the application, not in the file system per say.   If you are dead set on storing plain text in the file system Notational Velocity or nvAlt may better suit your needs.  <answer38703> You can do this without any third party software. Just use emAutomator/em to create your own emService/em that appends the input string to any text file.  hr  Open emAutomator/em and select to create a new emService/em that receives emno input/em in emany application/em.  From the emLibrary/em, drag the emRun AppleScript/em action to the area on the right, and use the following script code:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     return text returned of (display dialog "Enter some text:" default answer "") end run /code/pre  Then, add a emRun Shell Script/em action that receives input emto stdin/em, and replace the default script with the following:  precodecat &gt;&gt; /Users/danielbeck/notes.txt /code/pre  Instead of code/Users/danielbeck/notes.txt/code, specify any path.  Here's what it looks like in Automator:     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQNWS.png" alt="enter image description here"   Save as e.g. emAdd Note/em, and assign a keyboard shortcut in emSystem Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Services » General » Add Note/em  Here's the dialog box:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dd5Db.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can press emCancel/em, codeEscape/code, or codeCmd-Period/code to cancel.  hr  You can even change how the notes appear in the text file through changes to the emRun Shell Script/em action. For example, you can use the following instead, if you reconfigure the emRun Shell Script/em action to receive input emas arguments/em instead:  precodeecho $( date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" ) "$@" &gt;&gt; /Users/danielbeck/notes.txt /code/pre  It will look like this in the resulting file:  precode2012-01-30 12:38:56 foo 2012-01-30 12:38:58 bar /code/pre  <answer38730> notational velocity would be a very good choice &amp; it's free.  simply set up a global hotkey &amp; enter the text  you can also customize the size of the window  <answer38738> I use totalterminal for this along with vim. I press ctrl twice and it drops me into vim, where I can add to an open notes file.  I pressume you could probably get away with just keeping textedit open on a notes.txt but I like the colours of terminal :)   <comment43808> This solution requires that the frontmost application supports services. All well-behaved OS X applications do, but programs with horrible platform integration (usually cross-platform programs) like Firefox, Microsoft Word, or MacVim might not work.
