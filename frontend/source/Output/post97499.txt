Block site from being on Safari Top Sites <body> I have the following issue: some sites I use quite often, as facebook, appears at the top sites with several different urls, depending on the person I chat and so on. I remove them manually, which is quite boring. I would like to know if there is any way to block facebook and other sites from being add to Safari's Top Sites. Someone knows how to do that?  Thanks!  <answer97514> From Apple's support page: On the Top Sites page, click the Edit button. Then do any of the following:  ul liTo specify that a page be kept in Top Sites and not replaced by other pages visited more often, click the pin icon in the page’s upper-left corner./li liTo reverse this action, click the pin icon again./li listrongTo specify that a page never be included in Top Sites, click the X in the page’s upper-left corner./strong/li liTo display 24, 12, or 6 webpage previews, click Small, Medium, or Large./li liTo rearrange the pages, drag them./li /ul  When you finish making changes, click Done.  <answer97534> If you know which sites that you want on your Top Sites, you could strongfill the grid with pinned sites/strong. This way, more sites would not be added since they would not be able to replace pinned sites.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o2NI8.gif" alt="Pin Site"  <comment114408> Well, that's what I wanted to say when I said that I remove the pages manually: by clicking X when the duplicates appear. I wanted a way to force Top Sites to skip adding duplicates sites from the same domain from appearing at the Top Sites. <comment114502> This would solve the issue, but I wouldn't like to have to pin all sites at the top sites, so it can dynamically add sites as I change the sites I usually use.
