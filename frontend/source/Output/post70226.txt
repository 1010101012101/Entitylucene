Need to connect mac-mini and thunderbolt display to a Dell U2713HM for dual monitor 2560x1440 <body> I need to run a dual 27" 2560x1440 mac-mini. I already have a thunderbolt display and I tried connecting a Dell Ultrasharp with 2560x1440 to the HDMI port of the mac mini - that doesn't work.  There is a spare Thunderbolt port on the back of the Apple display, so do I use that and connect to the Dell?  If so, what port on the Dell do I use to get the full resolution - HDMI, DVI, Ethernet?  <answer70232> HDMI is out because the Mac Mini's HDMI port maxes out at 1920x1200. You're going to need to grab an adapter to go from Mini-Displayport to either dual-link DVI or Displayport, which are both supported by the Dell.  Now, the Thunderbolt display can't directly output Mini-Displayport for boring technical reasons (see question 20). There must be a non-display Thunderbolt device between the display and the adapter I mentioned above. The cheapest example I've found is the Seagate GoFlex Desk Thunderbolt Adapter (STAE122), which has two Thunderbolt ports for daisychaining and retails for about $180.  The full chain:br Mac Mini - Thunderbolt Display - STAE122 - MiniDP to DP or DL-DVI adapter - Dell monitor  <comment82509> Fantastic. I followed your advice here and it works perfectly.  I now have a 2560 x 1440 on Thunderbolt and Dell Ultrasharp.  Thank you. An ideal and most economical solution. <comment254427> Ugh. Ridiculous that we can't go Mac Mini  Thunderbolt Display  MiniDP to DP.
