I'm looking for a quick entry TODO application that syncs across an iPhone and my laptop <body> I haven't been able to find the following feature set all in one place:  ul liemoffline/em access :: Something which guarantees offline changes aren't lost./li liemquick entry/em :: I should be able to activate it with a global hot key and it should provide me a quick entry window, either HUD-like a la Anxiety or Menu Bar centric a la Alarms/li liemsynchronized/em :: It should synchronize across my iPhone/iPad/laptop, either via iCal TODOs or whatever./li liem0 wait mobile entry/em :: Related: some mobile apps synchronize embefore/em I can enter in a new item.  This sucks.  I want to be able to add a TODO on the go with no wait (and definitely with no wifi)./li liemno overdue, or autoadvancing overdue/em :: I don't want to spend any time maintaining my todo list.  If something is overdue, it should autoadvance to my "today" view/inbox or whatever.  I should be able to see at a glance all my tasks (including overdue ones) that I need to do today./li liemdue dates optional/em :: I shouldn't need to assign something a date./li /ul  Bonus points for something that's stored as a simple text file.  I'm open to solutions like Notesy + nvALT + Dropbox.  That particular combination fails because I use Notesy for other notekeeping, and so I can't satisfy the zero-wait constraint.  Thanks!  <answer34365> Try Wunderlist or Trello.   <answer34369> Check out OmniFocus (available for Mac, iPhone and iPad). It's a bit pricey, but does everything you want and a whole lot more. I can personally attest to the quality of these apps â€” they're fantastic and use all three of them every day.  <comment39257> Neither of those seem to provide a global hotkey.  I'd also like offline access, which Trello doesn't provide.  I didn't list that initially, thanks for the pointers though--
