What can I do when my SSH session is stuck? <body> Sometimes my ssh session in the terminal hangs. How can I exit the ssh session and reconnect?  <answer35525> delAll you need to do to exit an ssh session is type codeexit/code at the prompt./del  Try entering kbdShift/kbd+kbd`/kbd+kbd./kbd  <answer35528> If your session is hung and the prompt is no longer responsive you can just kill the Terminal instance and all child processes associated with that instance, of which your ssh session is one, should get axed along with it.  If you're really wanting to be thorough though you can open a new Terminal instance, look for ssh sessions in the process list, and kill them via the command line:  precode&gt; ps -ef  |grep ssh 501  1332   142   0 20Dec11 ??         0:01.33 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l 501 57172 57150   0  1:58pm ttys000    0:00.01 grep ssh 501 57139 57133   0  1:57pm ttys002    0:00.03 ssh -i/Users/ian/code/ec2-keys/id_rsa-gsg-keypair someuser@someinstance.amazonaws.com  &gt; kill 57139 /code/pre  If that doesn't work try:  precode&gt; kill -9 57139 /code/pre  Don't kill the codessh-agent/code process.  Or you can open Activity Monitor and search there for sessions and hit the kill button for them:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X7kEr.png" alt="Activity Monitor filtering for ssh sessions"  <answer35543> Type code~./code (i.e. tilde, period) at the beginning of a line. In other words, press kbdEnter/kbd, then kbd~/kbd, then kbd./kbd. (In some languages, you may need to press kbdShift/kbd or kbdAlt/kbd to enter the code~/code character.)  Generally speaking, the code~/code character is an escape character in an SSH session when you type it at the beginning of a line. Type kbdEnter/kbd then code~?/code to see the list of escape commands. The most common ones are  ul licode~./code to terminate the connection/li licode~^Z/code (press kbd~/kbd then kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdZ/kbd) to suspend the connection and type a command locally (run the command codefg/code to return to the SSH session)/li /ul  If you want a tilde at the beginning of a line, press kbd~/kbd twice.  <comment40467> It's not accepting user input anymore, it's literally stalled. On Ubuntu there's a keyboard combination that terminates the session that you can use in cases like these. After a while the session will terminate stating `broken-pipe` but I rather not wait. <comment40468> @Kit I fixed my answer. Sorry about that. I didn't realize you meant a completely stalled SSH session. <comment40494> I usually just wait for it to timeout. Despite the fact that I know about these commands, I always forget that I can use them to expedite the process of getting my shell back.  Note @Gilles answer as well, you may have to press Enter/Return once before `~.`  You can learn more in the [SSH manpage](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/ssh.1.html) (a bit over halfway in), and by typing: `~?` into an active/connected SSH session, again, you may have to hit enter once before. <comment40692> +1, this is what I do. Often where I've left a session running, and then either the connection breaks accidentally or I sleep the laptop, it causes ssh to freeze. I open a new console tab and kill the PID of the ssh process (or close the ssh tab and open a new one) <comment91567> Does using the keyboard shortcut work on your Mac without tediously killing the process? <comment163167> Wow. Super top!  To be clear, this solution seems to apply over the domain of all ssh connections, rather than the domain of OSX terminals. <comment251319> You're a genius dude! <comment285961> I wish I could upvote more than once! Great!
