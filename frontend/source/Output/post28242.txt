Thanks.  <answer28247> Any performance question depends on the exact specifics of your time critical software or benchmarks.  One can likely find benchmarks that show each of these machines as faster at some specific narrow task.  The "overall" performance depends on your mix of these tasks, which may or may not be similar to anyone else's here.  In general, Apple usually advertises their newer machines as faster at their chosen mix of apps, which again may or may not have any similarity to your specific or individual requirements or mix.  <answer28250> Faster overall is pretty subjective, but in 90% of all cases you should find the newer one faster. Unless you fall in the 10% in which case you might not, or you might, dependent on one of a dozen factors.   It's probably almost certain that it's almost always sometimes faster.   <comment32408> Voted to close. It's a bit too localized and you just slap the specs which is frankly unreadable.
