Apple warranty is less than a year <body> I yesterday (November 21, 2016) bought a new macbook pro 13 w/o tb late 2016. But I seen warranty up to October 28 2017, when I check at Apple site. It is less than a year. May be so? Or it means this macbook was in usage earlier? Cycle count is 3.  <comment328056> Is the package sealed when you open it? <comment328057> Yes, the package was sealed. I think easy to do package as sealed. <comment328058> Where have you bought the mac? <comment328059> In Russia at online store. <comment328060> Contact Apple Support or go to Apple Store,and provide them with your proof of purchase and purchasing time,they can refresh the warranty. <comment328062> Ok. It means macbook was in usage? <comment328064> Did you order the computer in October? If you bought the computer from Apple, is it possible warranty is by sale date, not delivery date? <comment328066> I ordered at November 20 at this online store. I understood. This online store works as mediator and not official reseller. May be they are ordered/bought at October from Apple. <comment328068> This could happen even no one ever use the computer. <comment328069> Yes. I am glad. Question has been exhausted. Thanks to everybody!
