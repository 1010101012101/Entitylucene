Automator Folder Watch: Run shell script results in error "Detected missing constraints for <private>" <body> When I'm running a Automator Folder Watch workflow, the console shows always the same error. I have searched Google and here, but did not find related issues.  My workflow is the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AhGAJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q7r8o.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodeDetected missing constraints for &lt;private&gt;.  It cannot be placed because there are not enough constraints to fully define the size and origin. Add the missing constraints, or set translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints=YES and constraints will be generated for you. If this view is laid out manually on macOS 10.12 and later, you may choose to not call [super layout] from your override. Set a breakpoint on DETECTED_MISSING_CONSTRAINTS to debug. This error will only be logged once. /code/pre  <comment372082> I found the error myself, the executed program must have absolute paths. <comment372104> You should answer your question.. For the next person that has the same question. Maybe an explanation how you found out... <comment372592> Using absolute paths for the exectued paths is the answer (even for programs located in /usr/local/bin/). The answer was found by trial+error and observing the console log. I still dont know why this type of error message is the output.
