mba 2012 protect data against theft <body> I'm looking for a way to protect my data files on my macbook air 2012  I'm a sales rep with sensitive client data. Always moving with my laptop in sleep mode.  So far I have my password set up, firewall enabled with all incoming connections blocked.  What else can I do to ensure data safety if someone gets an access to my mba SSD?  FileVault 2 is not secure (cracked in 40 minutes by security professions) TrueCrypt looks promising but I'm concerned about battery life.  Any advice?  <answer72754> I found an article at TUAW which talks about the Passware Kit Forensic 11.4 software designed to 'crack' Filevault 2. However, this software can be foiled by two simple configuration points: 1/ turn off automatic login &amp; 2/ shutdown the Mac instead of sleeping when you travel. In addition, the software requires physical access through a firewire or thunderbolt port so your computer cannot be touched through remote access.  The Privacycast site has this detailed article for your edification.  hr  Seeing that you have a MacBook Air, with its astoundingly brief startup time, I'm not sure why you keep it in sleep mode whilst traveling. I never put my MBA to sleep unless I'm at home. If somebody steals my MBA while I'm home, I have a substantially larger problem on my hands.  <comment85460> Sleep is overrated, lol. I think I will follow your advice on shutdown instead of sleep
