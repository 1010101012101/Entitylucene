How to reset OS X 10.8 to boot? <body> I ran the codedd/code command on code/dev/rdisk1/code and now OS X is not starting.  Is it possible to recover the OS? I have access to recovery mode, but Disk Utility says that the disk is fine.  <answer117093> You can Erase the disk using Disk Utility (open Disk Utility, select the disk, then the Erase tab, and click Erase), then use the Reinstall OS X option in the Recovery HD utilities list, following the instructions as a normal OS X install.  Alternatively, use Internet Recovery by booting with ⌘⌥R.  <comment136864> But in this case all my files would be lost? <comment136865> @user67308 Yes. If you have backups, you could recover from that. Can you access the files in Terminal whilst booted into the Recovery HD? <comment136885> The problem is that filevaul is on and i dont remember the password... But i have restore key, is it possible to get password by this key?
