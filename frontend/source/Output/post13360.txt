Cursor navigation in Terminal <body> I quite often find myself needing to move the cursor to the beginning or the end of the line.  Is there a strongkeyboard shortcut/strong or other magic trick to strongmove the cursor/strong apart from the arrow keys.   <answer13362> kbd^/kbd + kbdA/kbd for the beginning of the line  kbd^/kbd + kbdE/kbd for the end of the line.  Works with Cocoa control too.  kbd^/kbd = kbdCtrl/kbd  <answer15553> kbdMeta/kbd + kbdB/kbd is equivalent to kbdctrl/kbd+kbd←/kbd in Windows, while br kbdMeta/kbd + kbdF/kbd is equivalent to kbdctrl/kbd+kbd→/kbd  by default the Meta key is the Escape, but that's configurable.  <answer19081> You can also hold down the kbdalt/kbd key and click with your mouse wherever you want the cursor to jump to.   Note however, that this only works on the same line the cursor currently is on, so if you have a long command wrapping around two lines, you will have to jump to the beginning of the second line, jump one character back (so you´re on the end of the first line now) and then can use the kbdalt/kbd+mouse to navigate again.   <answer19086> You can use vi-style line movement and modal editing on the command line by adding codeset -o vi/code to your code~/.bash_profile/code.  <comment14119> Wolff - Cheers mate! <comment83710> And how exactly would one reconfigure this?
