Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for looking!  <answer122333> Use strongCrash Reporter/strong.  Crash Reporter will attempt to guess the cause of a crash. After installing, next time your iPhone crashes, you can check the 'Possible Causes' list in Crash Reporter for its guess on the cause. You can then try to delete the package in Cydia and see if that fixes the problem.  <answer181736> Just remove this tweak (StatusHUD 2 - 2.0.0)  <answer249552> I had a crash if I used the flipcontrolcenter. I removed nitrous and all is fine again.  <comment142745> Remove the tweaks one by one, starting with the tweak you've installed last. One of the tweaks is messing up. <comment142746> Only problem is, I just got the phone Monday and installed all my tweaks at the same time that I had on my 4S. But alright, I'll try when I have free time. Thanks. <comment142747> I don't understand the point of your comment Iounno, the fact that you had the same tweaks on a 4S is irrelevant. <comment142750> It doesn't for me for some reason. Just shows nothing. Though I remembered there was an issue with libhide on my 4S so I disabled it through iCleaner and my phone hasn't crashed yet, so that was probably it.  Edit: and now it did. Awesome. <comment142751> Because they were stable on my 4S, they should be stable on my 5s unless the tweak is unsupported (all are). So I'd assume it should work fine on my 5s, but I guess not.
