mysql on OSX suddenly stopped functioning, unable to locate or connect <body> Having been using an installed version of mysql for some time without any problem, when I attempted to start the server recently it simply failed to recognise the command.  The installation is still there and I can see my databases in the filesystem. However, I cannot start the server. See the following steps, which include trying to re-add mysql to the $PATH or the bash profile, as advised in several other answers (although I don't believe this was necessary before).  precodepointcloud:~ james$ mysql.server start -bash: mysql.server: command not found pointcloud:~ james$ cd ../../usr/local/var pointcloud:var james$ ls cache       homebrew    log     mysql pointcloud:var james$ cd mysql pointcloud:mysql james$ ls MacBook-Air.local.err           ibdata1 MacBook-Air.local.pid           ibtmp1 Otago-2.local.err           mysql Otago-2.local.pid           mysqld_safe.pid Pointcloud-Matrix-3885731C.local.err    otago.home.err Pointcloud-Matrix-3885731C.local.pid    performance_schema auto.cnf                pointcloud.err ca-key.pem              pointcloud.local.err ca.pem                  pointcloud.local.pid cameras                 pointcloud.pid client-cert.pem             pole client-key.pem              private_key.pem cloudpedia              public_key.pem flightpaths             satcat ib_logfile0             server-cert.pem ib_logfile1             server-key.pem pointcloud:mysql james$ echo $PATH /Users/james/torch/install/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin pointcloud:mysql james$ export PATH=/usr/local/var/mysql:${PATH} pointcloud:mysql james$ echo $PATH /usr/local/var/mysql:/Users/james/torch/install/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin pointcloud:mysql james$ mysql.server start -bash: mysql.server: command not found pointcloud:mysql james$  /code/pre  Some of the other answers refer to a /bin or /support-files directory in the mysql directory. I don't seem to have these.  I'm not aware what has changed since I last started the server. I have installed a number of Homebrew and Python packages, but not anything to do with mysql, as far as I am aware.  Any assistance in restoring access to my DBs gratefully received.  Alternatively, if there is a way of re-installing Mysql while preserving and re-importing the existing DBs, this would be a possibility.  Installed system version: OSX 10.11.4 (15E65)  hr  Edits:  I believe my mysql version was installed under homebrew, but it was some time ago (2yrs +) when I was less proficient, and I'm unable to recall the details.  codebrew list/code does not include mysql, so that is not the case.  precodepointcloud:mysql james$ brew list eigen       ilmbase     libpng      opencv      python      x264 ffmpeg      jpeg        libtiff     openexr     readline    xvid gdbm        lame        numpy       openssl     sqlite /code/pre  Searching for mysql binaries in the file system:  precodepointcloud:var james$ sudo find / -type f -name mysql find: /dev/fd/3: Not a directory find: /dev/fd/4: Not a directory /Volumes/Ironside II/Backups.backupdb/pointcloud/2016-11-26-201238/Macintosh HD/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.22/bin/mysql /Volumes/Ironside II/Backups.backupdb/pointcloud/2016-11-26-201238/Macintosh HD/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.9/bin/mysql /Volumes/Ironside II/Backups.backupdb/pointcloud/2016-12-12-110455/Macintosh HD/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.22/bin/mysql /Volumes/Ironside II/Backups.backupdb/pointcloud/2016-12-12-110455/Macintosh HD/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.9/bin/mysql /Volumes/Ironside II/Backups.backupdb/pointcloud/2017-01-02-114333/Macintosh HD/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.22/bin/mysql /Volumes/Ironside II/Backups.backupdb/pointcloud/2017-01-02-114333/Macintosh HD/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.9/bin/mysql /Volumes/Ironside II/Backups.backupdb/pointcloud/2017-01-04-122725/Macintosh HD/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.22/bin/mysql /Volumes/Ironside II/Backups.backupdb/pointcloud/2017-01-04-122725/Macintosh HD/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.9/bin/mysql /code/pre  <answer271408> It appears, evidenced by the backups, that at some previous (recent) point, the Homebrew version of mysql was uninstalled, leaving the data intact.  Reinstalling with codebrew install mysql/code returned full functionality.  <comment341127> As per edit: I installed it over two years ago when much less proficient. I think it was probably homebrew but actually do not know. How would I establish this? <comment341129> Then no, it's not under Homebrew after all. <comment341131> There are no mysql directories in /usr/local/ only in /usr/local/var/ (see transcript in question). I have used macports in the past, but do not currently have it installed. I'm not familiar with the other methods. <comment341139> Results in edit. Find is still running but hasn't output anything for ~10 minutes. <comment341146> Edited to add more locations - all in backups. Does it look like Homebrew deleted mysql recently? <comment341160> So it appears that mysql was recently uninstalled by homebrew. This was, in all likelihood, something I did by accident. If I reinstall mysql with homebrew, will it overwrite or retain the databases and other data which are still in /usr/local/var/? <comment341161> Presumably, the best option would be to make a backup copy of that directory, reinstall mysql with homebrew, and find out? <comment341165> There are no older versions available from `brew search`, but the latest is 5.7.17. <comment341168> Reinstallation of the latest verstion worked fine, and connected to the existing databases without any issues. Thank you very much indeed for walking me through that @klanomath. Hugely appreciated. <comment341171> Don't forget to remove /usr/local/var/mysql from your path if you added it permanently because that's no valid path for binaries. All mysql binaries are installed in the .../Cellar/mysql/5.7.17/bin folder and linked to /usr/local/bin
