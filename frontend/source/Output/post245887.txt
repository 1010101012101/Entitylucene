Changing the Country & Region with Gift Card <body> You can assume that I am able to change Country &amp; Region. I am trying to change my Country &amp; Region to Germany, though i do not own a German debit Card to do the verification. I am currently living in Germany and I have a german phone number, i tried with that as well but it accepts only numbers from O2 mobile company which i dont have.   Am I able to change Country if I buy and use a German Gift Card? Or if I cant with that either any help please?  <answer247862> The answer is, YES you can using a gift card bought in that country. Though you have to use a real address of that country for the process to finish.
