Restricting Command+tab options to only apps that are in the current space <body> strongEdit:/strong The original accepted answer is no longer valid for Mavericks.  I am keeping it accepted for historical reasons, but all readers using Mavericks should use and up-vote this answer.  hr  By default, pressing kbd⌘/kbd+kbdtab/kbd will display a list of emall/em open applications.  strongI would like that list to only include applications in the current space,/strong or at least give priority to applications with windows in the current space.  In other words, I'd like OSX to mimic the behavior of most X window managers with respect to their workspaces/virtual desktops.  Here's my rather long-winded explanation of why I want this:  I have disabled spaces' auto-switching, and I've mapped each space to a kbd⌘/kbd+kbdspace #/kbd shortcut.  In general, I usually have one application open per space, maximized.  Since I really only ever have a half-dozen or so applications open at any time, I can easily switch between them in constant time with my left hand.  The problem is that I sometimes do have two or three windows from different applications open in the same space (eme.g./em, I often have a PDF reader open in the same space as my web browser).   Let's say I have a terminal open in Space 1 and both a web browser and Preview open in Space 2.  If I am in the terminal and then decide I want to open a web page, I switch to Space 2, where the web browser has focus.  I then want to consult a PDF that is open in Preview, which is in the same Space but whose window is behind the web browser.  If I hit kbd⌘/kbd+kbdtab/kbd, however, the first option will be to take me back to Terminal in Space 1 (since Terminal most recently had focus).  In the worst case, I will have to cycle through all emn/em open applications by repeatedly pressing kbd⌘/kbd+kbdtab/kbd in order to get to Preview.  I want the first hit to kbd⌘/kbd+kbdtab/kbd to bring me to the next application with windows in the current space, emi.e./em, Preview.  I know that using Exposé is the more "Apple" way of handling these situations, but I want to avoid having to reach for the mouse.  I know I can also use the arrow keys to select a window in Exposé, but once again that breaks my mental model of the window layering, will institute a cognitive feedback loop in the selection, and will require worst case log(emn/em) keystrokes.   As far as I know, there is no constant-time way of switching to a specific application in the current workspace using only the keyboard.  <answer5675> strikeYou can try with Switché. They pretend that "Switché works great with Spaces and is able to display Space number badges".  As I'm not using Spaces I cannot confirm nor infirm but it's worth the try./strikebr See comments below.  <answer7508> kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF4/kbd.  Cycles through the applications in that Space.br  (I actually have this mapped to kbdcontrol/kbd+kbd`/kbd; which I find easier to remember, being close to the kbdcmd/kbd+kbd`/kbd; to cycle through an application's windows.)  To change the keyboard shortcut, go to the Keyboard preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Keyboard &amp; Text Input.  It's the 'Move focus to active or next window' option.  (Edit to fix the keyboard shortcuts; I didn't realise that the backtick character wasn't showing up.)  <answer7512> Pressing kbd⌃F4/kbd will do what you're asking for, but you might get carpal tunnel in the process.  Just from reading your example, it sounds like you may emactually/em be looking for strong⌘⇧⇥/strong, which cycles through applications in emreverse/em order, thus cutting the number of times you press strong⇥/strong in half. Now, that may still not be a constant time solution, but I think you'll find that the result of strong⌘⇥/strong is the application you want focus on 70% of the time, and  strong⌘⇧⇥/strong is the application you want focus on 28% of the time.  <answer128718> strongYosemite/strong  This behavior emcan/em be mapped to your desired key combination like so:     System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Keyboard  Move focus to active   or next window   strongMavericks/strong  code^F4/code does switch through windows in the current space but you may have to upgrade to Yosemite to map this behavior to code^~/code.  But the problem can still be alleviated like so:     System Preferences  Mission Control  Uncheck "When switching to an   application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application"   <answer153249> As an aside to this answer, I've been able to remap kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF4/kbd to kbdalt/kbd+kbdtab/kbd, which feels quite natural imo.  <answer178853> I know Hyperswitch didn't exist when that question was asked, but it is a modern answer to that question, and it is much better than hacking with Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) and/or struggling with the system preferences (since they don't accept any key mapping for every command).  Please see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/127414 and upvote it if you find HyperSwitch useful.  <answer186193> Although this doesn't technically answer the original question, those here looking for a more configurable Cmd-Tab app switcher could look at SuperTab .  Disclaimer: I bought this and it think it's well done.  <answer276093> I'm the author of Command-Tab Plus application which allows you to quickly switch between applications, and additionally between windows (using the ability of Mac OS cmd+tilde) Youtube video  <comment5839> There are a couple of packages that offer enhancements/replacements for the built-in application switching. You might want to consider contacting the developers of one or more of these packages and let them know you would be interested in Spaces specific switching. <comment5840> I am familiar with (although I have never used) Witch; are there any others at which I should look? <comment5860> Try it, but be aware switche has a really crappy demo.  It has a popup asking you to buy every 3 or 4 times you switch windows.  Drove me nuts in about 20 minutes and I uninstalled it. <comment5867> I've seen mentions of LiteSwitch and App Switcher, but I haven't used any of these. <comment8044> Switché shows all open apps. It does not do what the OP requests. <comment8046> I think must use CTRL+fn+F4. <comment8084> @Am1rr3zA It depends on what kind of keyboard you have. <comment8086> Thanks; this is exactly what I want!  How did you re-map it?  I don't see it in the keyboard shortcuts list in System Preferences.  If I were able to map this function to ⌘+tab, it would solve all of my problems. <comment8089> It's the 4th one down in Keyboard & Text Input.  I'm not sure if you can remap CMD-TAB, but you could set it to ALT-CMD-TAB or whatever you like.  (To do the actual remapping, click on the ^F4 in the keyboard shortcuts list.  That section should turn editable and you can press whatever key combination you want to use.) <comment8090> I just noticed that whatever shortcut you use, adding SHIFT will reverse the cycling order.  I use CTRL-backtick so pressing CTRL-SHIFT-backtick will cycle through the windows in reverse order. <comment8118> Hmm, I don't remember the numerous nag screens when I tested it some time ago. Doesn't deserve then to be publicized. I edited my answer. <comment65648> For me, ⌘⇥ is right about 50% of the time, and the other 50% is about log(1.5)ly split between the other apps. <comment133724> I think this isn't quite what was asked. `CTRL`+`F4` switches between **windows** in the current space, but the question was about switching between **applications** in the current space. I point this out because I have 2 terminal apps and 1 Emacs app open in a space, and I want to easily switch between the terminal windows and the Emacs app. Maybe I'll ask another question... <comment150754> This keyboard shortcut is no longer present in System Preferences as of Mavericks. <comment150804> This is great.  Thanks! <comment177905> i notice there's an issue unless you specifically click on the app window itself in the new space (if you switch to a new space and use the shortcut, it switches back to the previous space) <comment188064> I have successfully remapped `^F4` to `^~` in Yosemite, so perhaps they fixed that bug? <comment188176> @Glyph Thanks, I've updated my answer. <comment257551> (this isn't an answer, more of a wish/rant!) This is exactly how things should work:  1. OSX should expose a number of 'sets' such as "all apps", "all apps in current space", "all windows in current app", "all tabs in app", etc.  2. Several 'movements' should be supported such as "next/previous in set", "number in set", "previous in history", etc. That last one is what's often missing below the app level and is *vital* for switching back and forth between, e.g. a couple of different tabs  Now let me configure any combination of the two. Please, if an apple employee is reading, make this happen <comment315764> Aww, osx windows management is so f*d up. Why not just let users tick some setting if they want to swap between windows in space scope or global scope. Your solution works but for developers who has ctrl+' bind to functionality in IDEs its useless and considering you have to use stupid osx cmd+` to swap between windows of same app (which is UX nightmare), there is no other convenient keyboard shortcut to use for this. Otherwise brilliant UI is so messed up with so basic rookie UX mistakes from Apple. Very disappointed :( <comment315765> Plus one for carpal tunnel :D I think Apple wants developers to get one... I bet they own shares in some medical industry company treating ergonomic diseases :) <comment330112> Hyperswitch solves *exactly* what @ESultanik was asking for. Cmd-Tab still is the traditional app switch (with the added screenshot of the app windows and in which spaces they are), plus *alt*-tab switches only between the apps within the current space <comment348308> [Command-Tab Plus site](http://commandtab.noteifyapp.com) <comment367918> If I press ctrl+f4 I have another window. However, if I press it again, it does not move back, rather moves to another window. Is there a way to make this behave the same as cmd + tab?
