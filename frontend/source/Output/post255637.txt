focus does not set on emoji panel in 10.11.5 (El Capitan) <body> When i prompt the emoji panel (with Ctrl-Cmd-space), the focus stays on the application i'm using, so i can't select the emoji / characters with the arrows and return keys.  In previous versions of macos, it used to work fine (with focus set on the panel, so inserting an emoji was just a few key strokes task).  Now i have to, you know, take the mouse, look where the pointer is, try to move it with my clumsy hand to the right tiny square of the screen, etc. ;) )
