Does Xcode require El Capitan to run? <body> I am planning to buy a Mac Mini and would like to know the minimum requirements to run Xcode 7.  I didn't find clear information on this topic.  <answer225374> As you can find here, in the Apple Developers webpage:     Xcode 7 requires a Mac running OS X version 10.10.4 or later. It   includes SDKs for watchOS 2.0, iOS 9, and OS X version 10.11.   As you see in the attached pic, Yosemite can still be valid to run XCode7, if it is updated to the 10.10.4+ version required. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D2Qe2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment273454> So, the answer would be yes? Or would Yosemite suffice? <comment273456> Or if you want to run an older version of Xcode on an older version of OS X you could download Xcode 6 from Apple Developer Downloads (if you are a registered Apple developer). <comment273457> Yes, if Yosemite is updated to at least version 10.10.4+. To check this, press the Mela button  About this Mac, and you'll see your current OSX version. <comment273458> Thank you. Do you think that this would change in the near future? <comment273459> You mean allowing older OSX versions to install XCode7? <comment273460> I am looking to buy a Mac Mini for iPhone app testing. But I wonder if maybe I would buy one that supports Yosemite, it might not support El Capitan and maybe I would not be able to use it in the near future, if this requirements increases. But I'm very new to Apple <comment273462> If you buy a Mac mini (Late 2014), its later OS X included is 10.10.2, but you can easily update to El Capitan, since it supports all Mac mini version from 2009. <comment273463> Macs bought from the Apple Store come with El Capitan pre-installed <comment273466> @Z0q Every Mac that can run Yosemite can run El Capitan. <comment273468> Perfect. I would like to cast some upvotes, but I do not have enough reputation :)
