Safari no longer defaults to typing in address bar. Why? <body> I recently deleted cookies and deleted my AdBlocker for Safari. Since then, things have been acting weird, e.g. websites open slowly, my homepage was set to Yahoo, etc.  Previously, when I would open a new tab, the cursor would be in the address bar. Any typing I would do would start there. Now, I must manually click the address bar, or use the codeCommand + L/code shortcut to go there.   That's a pain. How could I reset this? I see nothing in Safari's Preferences.   <answer187909> Your system could have been infected with adware and/or malware. See this Apple Support page on how to remove adware.  For malware, I have relied on Sophos' free Antivirus for Mac for several years. I use it on my home machines, and my school uses it enterprise-wide on all Mac and Windows desktops, laptops and servers.  <answer239345> Under Safari - Preferences - Search -  Uncheck “Include Safari Suggestions”  <comment222391> You're right. It looks like my Mac was infected by some browser redirect malware. <comment293744> Welcome to Ask Different.
