copy the link of the current played video/stream in iOS <body> Is it possible to copy the link of the current played video/stream in iOS in the Safari or another 3rd party Browser? Have a look at the screenshot below in the bottom left corner.  In OS X I'm able to do it with a right click on the video/stream and then strongCopy Video Address/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3970p.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Does someone have an idea?  <answer213702> Sadly, there is no such feature in Apples APIs at the moment. I solved it writing a short script which searches the HTML code for video URLs.  strongUPDATE/strong: But there's the possibility to view the url. Look at Josh Newman's answer. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/268156/153006  <answer268156> I wasn't able to copy the URL, however if you want to view the entire thing to transcribe it, start playing your video and then lock your iOS device.  The full URL should scroll by on your lock screen.  <comment255342> It looks like this URL is displayed for convenience only. Is the URL not available for capture from the browser which initiated the video/stream? <comment255344> Unfortunately not. I can't figure it out. In OS X it's possible with a right click and then **Copy Video Address**, but in iOS it looks like there isn't such a function. I tried to tap and hold and some other gestures. Nothing worked out for me. <comment336543> Would you care to share?  I'm looking to do the same thing.  Thanks <comment336591> Yeah that's correct. I'll update my answer. <comment336592> Unfortunately, there's no script which works universally. Mine is just for one website.
