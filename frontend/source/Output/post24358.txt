Mac blogging client similar to Windows Live Writer <body> Can someone suggest a really good blogging client for Mac OS?   I am looking for something having similar functionality like Windows Live Writer (on Windows).  Blog details: WordPress (installed on Windows). I have a Mac laptop at home, and am trying to decide on a blogging client for WordPress.  <answer24360> I haven't had any exposure to live writer, but maybe you might want to give MarsEdit a try. It can interface with many different blogging systems.  <answer24386> Other than the MarsEdit, You may also want to try the Ecto, or MacJournal  <comment27318> Have you picked your blog serving stack? Wide open, anything but X, or a preference for Y? <comment27339> Unless there are constraints on what the OP wants to use for publishing the blog - I would also choose MarsEdit as the hands-down "best" app for such an open question.
