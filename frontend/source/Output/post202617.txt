iPhone 5 not receiving certain texts <body> About a week ago my iPhone 5 stopped receiving texts from certain contacts. They receive my texts and can call me but cannot text me. I restored the phone and also reset network connections. Nothing is working. I called AT&amp;T and they said everything is fine.  <comment244415> Is there anything that these contacts have in common? <comment244416> Specifically, what I'm thinking is: Are they all either iPhone or Android? <comment244503> You can answer that question by looking at the color of your text bubble when you text them.. If it's blue then your texting another iPhone, if it's green some other type of phone.
