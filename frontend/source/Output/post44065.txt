How do I un-hide a photo in the iPhone iPhoto app? <body> I mistakenly hit the 'x' button while editing a photo from the Camera Roll, and now I can't find the flagged menu to un-hide it as illustrated in the help.  Fortunately the photo is still in my Camera Roll, so how do I get it back into the iPhoto app?  <answer44066> Turn your iPhone sideways and in the upper left hand corner hit the down arrow. Then select "Hidden Photos". This will show you a list of the photos you've hidden. Tap one, hit edit, and tap the "X" again to unhide it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpu8v.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XT0Ls.png" alt=""  <answer44067> You can show the hidden photos by tapping in the upper left corner:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyrcL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
