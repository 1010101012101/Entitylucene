How to disable Self Control application? <body> I use SelfControl quite frequently for completing homework and such, but at school, while I was away from my keyboard at the white board, my friend thought it would be funny to set the timer to 10 hours.  I am currently using a proxy to ask this question.  Is there any way to disable this useful, but inflexible application?  <answer52593> Have you tried opening Terminal (Applications - Utilities - Terminal) and using the commands:  precodekillall SelfControl /code/pre  or  precodesudo killall SelfControl /code/pre  As it is not working try the hosts file:  precodesudo nano /etc/hosts /code/pre  And look for something like this  precode# BEGIN SELFCONTROL BLOCK 127.0.0.1   www.nasa.gov 127.0.0.1   nasa.gov # END SELFCONTROL BLOCK /code/pre  delete the entire block and hit CTRL + O to save the file and CTRL + X to exit. Everything you put at stronghosts/strong file like:  precode127.0.0.1 facebook.com 127.0.0.1 nasa.gov 127.0.0.1 stackoverflow.com /code/pre  Those addresses will be blocked, you will not be able to access them while they are inside the stronghosts/strong file  To stop and delete SelfControl running as a background process:  precodesudo su - cd /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/ rm org.eyebeam.SelfControl /code/pre  To delete the firewall rules that have been introduced by SelfControl, read this blog article by Joshua Kehn:  http://joshuakehn.com/2010/10/25/Defeating-SelfControl.html  <answer63025> Sometimes deleting what's between the code# BEGIN SELFCONTROL/code and code# END SELFCONTROL/code doesn't work.   On the other side, changing the Date or Time worked perfectly for me! All you gotta do is change your date to something in the future, for example if today is Sep 4 you can change your system date to something like Sep 5 !    ol liYou open Preferences Open Date &amp; Time  /li liChange the date to something like Sep 5 or any date in the future./li liOpen SelfControl, the countdown will be gone now./li /ol  Try opening a website that you blocked with selfControl! if it does work! then it's all you gotta do ... otherwise try changing the date back to the original date (Sept 4) for example, and try again opening the website that you blocked with SelfControl!    <answer79807> I had to remove the lines in code/etc/hosts/code, change the date in code/etc/SelfControl.lock/code, and reopen the SelfControl application:  precodesudo sed -i '' '/# BEGIN SELFCONTROL/,/# END SELFCONTROL/d' /etc/hosts sudo sed -i '' 's|&lt;date&gt;.*|&lt;date&gt;2010-01-01T01:01:01Z&lt;/date&gt;|' /etc/SelfControl.lock killall SelfControl; open -a SelfControl /code/pre  Just deleting code/etc/SelfControl.lock/code didn't work. If you have removed SelfControl.app, download it again first.  <answer90748> It's simple, just open preferences, and change the date to the next day!  <answer245264> Quit SelfControl.   Open System Preferences  Date and Time  Change the day 1 day in the future.   Launch SelfControl again. Quit SelfControl and then change the date back.   This works because SelfControl checks the date and time, sees that you are past the blocking period, and removes the host file additions.   <comment60145> Yes. It keeps running even when the application is closed, so killall won't work... <comment60146> Sorry I didn't understand you <comment60150> I have the # BEGIN SELFCONTROL BLOCK and # END SELFCONTROL BLOCK.  What should I do now? <comment60151> Delete the entire block and save the file. There probably be IP numbers and sites addresses inside the block. if you put: `127.0.0.1 facebook.com` for example it will be blocked <comment60153> Hit CTRL + O to save the file and CTRL + X to exit <comment60154> I did this, and now I can access Google, but every other website is still blocked, and there is nothing in the    /etc/hosts file... <comment60155> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/3623/discussion-between-tenshimsm-and-ruddrobinet) <comment60156> Never mind, I got it. Thanks! <comment119528> As a note, you should have your computer to ask for a password before making changes. So when I activate my self control program, i have to put my password in first. This will prevent unauthorized of the program. <comment119530> Changing the time does not work if you are connected to the internet. <comment119531> @Mindy How so? I change time often when connected to he network. <comment190806> You are genius! <comment302687> Can confirm this works. <comment337654> the purpose is to not disable it <comment337655> could self control prevent this? <comment345541> I wish it was harder than this!
