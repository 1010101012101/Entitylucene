How can I discover the type of replacement screws I need? <body> I'm looking for 3 replacement screws for my MacBook Unibody (late 2008, model 4,1 A1278), but I can't seem to find a proper set of case replacement screws ANYWHERE! There are 3 types of case screws, as shown below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z4EEb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I'm missing 3 of the 4 "blue" screws, and ALL the kits I could find on eBay, Amazon, Google, etc. contain kits with the 3 "red" screws, and the rest are the "green" type, which are different from the "blue" type I need.  Are these screws standard? (i.e. is there any hope of me finding generic ones on whole sale?) If so, what type are they?  <comment113470> Have you checked [the iFixit store?](http://www.ifixit.com/Parts-Store) <comment113472> I think this might be it, [here](http://www.ifixit.com/MacBook-Parts/MacBook-Unibody-Model-No-A1278-Screw-Set/IF160-021). Expensive and currently out of stock, but it should have what you need at the very least. <comment113489> I saw that set on the iFixit store, but it's $60 for a set of screws (of which I need 3), putting it's value at $20/screw for me lol. Is there anyway to find the specifications of the screws i need? <comment113508> According to [this](http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+MacBook+Unibody+Model+A1278+Lower+Case/756/1) (step 4), they seem to be 3.5 mm Phillips screws. <comment113509> Nice find, so far I know: Type #00 Phillips, 3.5mm long, now just to find the tread pitch
