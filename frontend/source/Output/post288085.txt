What is difference between network service and network interface <body> I'm a little bit confused about the difference between a codenetwork interface/code and codenetwork service/code. For example, the codeifconfig/code utility documentation talks in terms of the network interface:     ifconfig en0   While "networksetup" is using network service:     networksetup -getinfo %network service name%   Can a single network interface have multiple network services?  <answer288087> codenetworksetup/code is the CLI interface for network settings panel in System Preferences.  From the codeman page/code:     The networksetup command is used to configure network settings   typically configured in the System Preferences application.   codeifconfig/code is the utility to set up a network interface.  From the codeman page/code     The ifconfig utility is used to assign an address to a network   interface and/or configure network interface parameters.   What you are seeing is two different methods with different nomenclature for the same thing.  codenetworksetup/code is specific to macOS where codeifconfig/code is more generic and part of the BSD core  As to your question...     Can a single network interface have multiple network services?   Yes.  For instance, you can have an alias for that interface.  Using actual System Prefs (because it's visually easier), I created a new service called "Ask Different Demo" to my existing interface "Ethernet"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dKJMe.png" alt="enter image description here"
