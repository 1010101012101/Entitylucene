Yosemite com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.cloudpaird) is running every 10 seconds <body> I am getting this message that repeats every 10 seconds on my Mac in Console:  "com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.cloudpaird) Service only ran for 0 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 10 seconds." I saw a similar question with "com.viber.osx" but with mine there is no reference to a missing program. What I entered in quotes is the entire message.  This is on a 2009 MacBook Pro with 8 MB RAM, 500 GB Samsung SSD on Yosemite 10.10.3. I recently upgraded to the SSD and put in a new battery.  Console is the only program running. I have restarted and repaired permissions to no avail. Does anyone have any idea what "com.apple.cloudpaird" is and how to fix this?

Get it from here http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck <comment219551> I don't use iCloud other than for Find my iPhone. I have a Synology NAS for backups and personal cloud. <comment219553> Do run the Etrecheck to see what is going on. It just creates your system profile, it is not intrusive. Something is preventing it accessing that drive. Do you have any virus scanners ? <comment219584> @Dan please edit the question instead of pasting additional information as comments. <comment219585> @Buscar웃 thanks for moving all those comments in to the question. <comment219589> Ok, lets do some surgery. Delete the com.apple.cloudpaird.plist and restart, That will create a new one. @IanC. it is a part of my job description :) <comment219716> Buscar I have Bitdefender virus scanner. Don’t use it regularly. Just ran it when I got it several months ago.   The file com.apple.cloudpaird is an exec file not a plist file. It is located in system/library/coreservices. Since it is an exec file not plist should I still delete it? @IanC Sorry about posting in the wrong section. <comment219784> I found the .plist file and deleted it. I restarted and the respawn every 10 second problem is resolved. However the file cloudpaird is now in EtreCheck under Problem System Lunch Daemons in place of the com.apple.cloudpaird.plist file. <comment219786> Also new com.apple.cloudpaird.plist file was not created.
