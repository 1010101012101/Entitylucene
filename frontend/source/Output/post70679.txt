Block network with Network Link Conditioner? <body> Any one know how to block all network traffic with the codeNetwork Link Conditioner/code on Mountain Lion? Here's the custom offline profile I made that's not working. I'm trying to block the network for the iPhone Simulator. Thanks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ThVV3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer70680> Assuming you really want the answer how to block traffic rather than using the tool you have at hand, I'll suggest you use Little Snitch.  It is a firewall that works on interrupting the flow of data out from apps to the internet.  Perhaps someone will know how to bend the Network Link Conditioner to work as a firewall for the one app, but I'd start with one of the tools for that job if no one has a good recipe for the latter.
