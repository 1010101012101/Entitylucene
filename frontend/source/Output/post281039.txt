Mail - collapse by sender <body> I know there's a way to collapse conversations in Mail so your inbox doesn't show each exchange in a chain of emails unless you expand them, is there a way to do that by sender?  Like I get a collection of emails from places like Amazon, Youtube, ect. all the time and I'd like to be able to just have them all under a collapsed section rather than just tons of emails littered throughout my inbox from them.   <comment353578> They must all have the same title to be 'a conversation'
