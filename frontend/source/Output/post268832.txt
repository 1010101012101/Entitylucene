Will the iPad mini 4's screen be damaged if the 'Auto Lock' is set to Never? <body> I want to keep an ipad in a wall mount running constantly by setting "Auto Lock" to "Never", the wall mount provides the ipad with power via the usb thunderbolt port, so there is no real issue with battery life degradation.   But im worried about the screen, is the screens backlight and screens material similar to an LED TV in that if it stays on a static image for to long it can become burned in ?   <comment337604> A quick google search revealed some complaints about screen burn in on some of the iPad models. I'd you plan on mounting the iPad permanently, I wouldn't worry about screen burn because it doesn't matter. If not, I'd be more careful. It's worth either a call to Apple customer support or a trip to an Apple Store if one is nearby
