macOS Sierra problem with Mac mini: Electric power doesn't turn off by itself anymore <body> Two weeks ago I installed MacOS Sierra on my Mac mini. The device is from the late 2014 edition of Mac mini.  Since then I've the following problem:  The OS shuts down when shutdown triggered from within the running OS. But the electric power keeps on the device. At least the little LED on front of the device stays on. Please see the picture.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/re9Ay.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I've the push the Power-On button at the back of the device for to get it turned-off.  strongAre there others who have that problem with their devices?/strong  strongHow should I handle the problem?/strong   strongIs there a way to get rid of it?/strong
