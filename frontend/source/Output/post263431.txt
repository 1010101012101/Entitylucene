Settings  Messages  Send &amp; Receive. Tap your Apple ID, then tap Sign Out. 2. Settings  FaceTime. Tap your Apple ID, then tap Sign Out.  <comment330021> In the settings app - is the phone number for your phone the same number as you see in settings for messages? Fix the former first and the second should follow. <comment354950> This appears to only be a partial answer.  Can you edit it to add complete info, as asked in the question, about how to change a phone number on Facetime and Messages?
