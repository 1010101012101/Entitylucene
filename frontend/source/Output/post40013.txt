Many Applications accessing obsolete x509anchors <body> When I look into console.app I see that every 2 minutes one of the mac os programs (Safari, Mail, Keychain, Addressbook, WebProcess etc.) is giving an "Warning: accessing obsolete X509Anchors." error. How do I solve this problem?  precodeSysteminfo:  Mac OS 10.6.8 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zenU4.png" alt="Warning: accessing obsolete X509Anchors."  <answer51809> Did you perhaps upgrade from an earlier version of OS X? Apparently this error is benign:      The X509Anchors keychain is harmless and can be left in place. If you do not use any third-party software that requires this keychain, it can be deleted.   <comment45301> Have you deleted any certificates from your Keychain? Or added any new Root level certificates? <comment45350> This has been a long time ago, I just don't know :( But I have been looking at the X509Anchors Keychain and saw that there are 6 non trusted certificates in it, for example "Free SSL Certification Authority"
