Open a folder in default browser <body> I have many web projects that I develop on the localhost. Normally to get to these one has to navigate from the root directory or bookmark the url.  I want to be able to open an OS directory/folder in the default browser. So for example I right-click a 'project A' folder and choose 'open in browser' and go there directly. I would like to be able to specify the beginning of the url, so I can change codefile:////code to codehttp://localhost//code or codemymac.local//code.  I am imagining this could be done with Applescript but I'm not experienced in that. Is there any way to achieve this?  <answer56425> You can add a right click item via Automator. Open Automator and copy this workflow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bprop.png" alt=""br When you save it, it will appear in your right click menu under Services:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5sN8x.png" alt=""br I'm not completely sure what you mean by changing the URL protocol, but I should be able to modify this to accomplish what you want  <answer56456> I think this Applescript saved as a service will do it:br (Set to "Service receives selected codefiles or folders/code in codeFinder/code")  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set basePath to "users/username/folder/"     set baseURL to "http://localhost"      repeat with i in input         tell application "Safari"             if not (exists (document 1)) then                 --                 -- Safari is *Not* Opened, Call Open New Window Function, Go To Preferred Page                 -- and Activate Safari to Enable Scripting                 --                 tell application "Safari" to activate                 my open_new_window()                 --                 -- Set Safari Location to Preferred Page                 --                  set theFileName to POSIX path of i                 set thePath to text (length of basePath+1) thru -1 of theFileName                 set the URL of document 1 to baseURL &amp; thePath             else                 --                 -- Safari is Opened, Bring it To Front and Open New Tab w/Preferred Page                 --                 if (exists (URL of document 1)) then                     my open_new_tab()                 end if                 --                 -- and Activate Safari to Enable Scripting                 --                 tell application "Safari" to activate                 --                 -- Set Safari Location to Preferred Page                 --                 set theFileName to POSIX path of i                 set thePath to text (length of basePath+1) thru -1 of theFileName                 set the URL of document 1 to baseURL &amp; thePath             end if         end tell      end repeat      return input end run  -- -- Open New Window Function -- on open_new_window()     tell application "Safari" to activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Safari"             click menu item "New Window" of menu "File" of menu bar 1         end tell     end tell end open_new_window  -- -- Open New Tab Function -- on open_new_tab()     tell application "Safari" to activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Safari"             click menu item "New Tab" of menu "File" of menu bar 1         end tell     end tell end open_new_tab /code/pre  Cobbled together from a few sources!  <comment64769> Where is your web directory based? (/Users/username/Sites?) <comment64798> Thanks so close! It's almost working, in Chrome it opens two windows not one, and Safari opens a blank window with an activity panel error saying 'frame load interrupted' - I think it's possibly security related? Can you possibly verify whether it's same for you? <comment64799> I am not using the OSX Sites folder, I have been using MAMP & a folder with a path like /Users/username/-/work <comment64852> Weird. I forgot to actually test it in Safari. Safari just doesn't load it at all and Chrome *does* load two pages for me. I didn't notice it. I'll have to mess around with it more...
