How to reach QHD resolution (external display) on MacBook Pro mid 2012 non-Retina <body> I have a MacBook Pro mid 2012 non-Retina (specs) and an AOC monitor with QHD res, but I cannot get it to reach over 1080p. On the Apple page linked before there is this:     Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors.   But how can I reach that. Right now I am using a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and I guess it could be it that limits the resolution. I also used the DVI port instead of HDMI but nothing changed. Any advice?  <answer282144> Tried display port to minidisplay port and it works!
