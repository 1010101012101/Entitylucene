Use macOS sound output as input <body> Do anybody know an app that allows the macOS sound output to be used as a microphone?br Or a .kext, an Apple script or something else?br I want it for stuff like screen recordings in quickTime where I can't record the system sound.   <comment349171> If you search for "audio output input" on the site you get a lot of possible solutions. If the don't work for you, please edit the question to indicate what you've tried and how it failed.
