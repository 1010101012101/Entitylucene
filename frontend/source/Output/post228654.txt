How does the battery life of the Magic Mouse 2 compare to the original? <body> I know it's a somewhat inexact comparison (with the 1's AA batteries and the 2's Lightning charger). But if anyone has used both, is there a noticeable difference?  <comment278838> Mind indicting where a figure of 2 minutes of full charge/9 hour battery life is stated? http://www.apple.com/magic-accessories/ would indicate a full charge taking 2 hours resulting in about a month of usage. <comment278839> [Here](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/10/24/review-apples-magic-trackpad-2-and-magic-mouse-2-open-new-doors-for-mac). At the link you posted, how do you know Apple is referring to the mouse? The wireless mouse uses considerably more power than the wireless keyboard, and the page does not clarify where that month figure applies. <comment278840> That link that you posted includes the statements: "full charges complete in 2 hours" and "One month between charges", which corresponds with the Apple page. <comment278841> Ah. I am going to rephrase my question.
