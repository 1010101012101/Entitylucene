Why is my MacBook Air is making ticking sounds? <body> Recently, my MacBook Air began making ticking sounds at regular intervals once powered on, akin to the sound of a woodpecker. The sounds occur at regular intervals, beginning every 5.2(ish) seconds and lasting about .8 seconds. I cannot identify where the sound is coming from. What could this be caused by? Is it something to take to my local genius bar urgently or is it simply an annoyance?  <answer276458> You don't specify the exact model of MacBook Air, but if it's one of the first models, or one of the Late 2008 or mid 2009 models, then it's possible you have a HDD for storage instead of a SSD.   A hard drive starting to have problems could certainly explain the ticking sound (although you seem to provide very precise and regular intervals). Otherwise it emcould/em be a fan.  Regardless, I would strongly recommend you testing your hardware. How you do this will depend on your model, so choose the appropriate option below.  strongRun Apple Hardware Test for all MacBook Airs up to and including the Mid-2012 models/strong  Your model uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your MacBook Pro /li liRestart your MacBook Pro/li liPress and hold the kbdD/kbd key before the gray startup screen appears./li liAfter a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start./li liWhen prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. /li liWhen the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the "Perform extended testing" checkbox before you click the Test button./li liYour test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console./li /ol  strongNote 1:/strong that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back.   strongNote 2:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.  strongRun Apple Diagnostics for all MacBook Airs from Mid-2013 onwards/strong  Your model uses Apple Diagnostics. To use this, follow these steps:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  <answer276505> It's indeed difficult to know, but if you emdon't/em have the 1st gen. with a spinning hard drive, I had a similar ticking on my 2011 MacBook Air 13". Very regular with approx. the interval you indicate. I have heard of one other instance with the same too, which indicates there are probably many of them. Mine started after a fall, which didn't leave any visible marks. Could have been incidental.   I identified the source as close to the MagSafe connector. My hypothesis was and continues to be that it was power related, i.e. 'sparks' or electricity jumps somewhere on the MagSafe board, probably capacitor related. It never bothered me enough to truly investigate, and it came and went, sometimes gone for weeks before it would start again.  If you want to test, I would get a new MagSafe board off eBay, stick it in and see if the sound disappear. Then report back.  <comment347934> Does it sound like a broken fan? I think that would tick more regularly though.... <comment347945> It indeed seems to be a fan issue. Reference codes PPF003 and PPF004 <comment347950> Yep, those codes indicate there's probably  an issue with a fan. You'll have to arrange a visit to Apple or an Apple authorised service provider. All the best with it! <comment348086> Just for reference, the fan is right next to the I/O board (which includes your MagSafe port). Particularly since it occurred after a drop, chances are that it's actually the fan. If something was shorting, you'd likely be getting shutdowns or some of the ports on that board switching themselves off so it's probably less dire that that :)
