How to run C Programs on Macbook without XCode? <body> I have new Macbook Air. I just want to run C programs and PHP scripts. For these 2 requirements, I don't want to install XCode with size of 5GB. Can anyone please let me know how to execute C Code and PHP code without installing XCode?  <comment374192> You'll get better answers if your question focuses on one issue. <comment374193> Anyway: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/114884/is-there-a-way-to-install-gcc-in-osx-without-installing-xcode <comment374199> You can run both C programs and PHP scripts on macOS without installing Xcode or any extras. If you want to _compile_ C programs, you'll need a C compiler. You can find several free C compilers online that you can install instead of Xcode.
