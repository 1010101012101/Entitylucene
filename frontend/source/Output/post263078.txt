How can I automate the copying of a whole disk content to another Mac? <body> I'm trying to create an automated Data Transfer script that transfers all files (including software and licenses) to another Mac computer that’s connected via thunderbolt cable. This should be able to be run on any computer by any users. The computer it’s ran on should transfer to the computer connect with a progress bar showing status.  I know that I can use  precodesudo rsync -vaE --progress /Volumes/SourceName /Volumes/DestinationName /code/pre  to copy whole directory trees, but this is only part of the solution. How can I create a bash script to do the whole work?  <comment329608> Also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/87916/best-rsync-options-to-transfer-data-between-two-mac?rq=1 and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14754/rsync-backup-script?rq=1 <comment329653> Well, this still looks a bit like "do my homework" but let's see whether somebody has an answer here. Can you share some light on the need for using bash/rsync? What do you expect to happen with data/files already stored on the target computer? And, equally important, what kind of use case/real world problem are you trying to solve here (knowing this may open the door for better solutions/answers)? <comment329686> @patrix Absolutely not. Firstly, I would like to further my knowledge of rsync and bash scripts in general. Typically, I learn better by watching how it's done or referencing an example that's broken down. Let's say I owned a start up company, and I wanted to upgrade my employees computer to a newer model. To accomplish that, I would have to transfer their data. I know I can use time machine, but I am trying to get more familiar with rsync and automation in general. It'd be nice if the user could just double click a bash script and it takes care of it all for them. Automation is the future. <comment329693> See my reply in the chat.
