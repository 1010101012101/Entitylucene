Force Macs to run Xprotect updater through terminal to get latest NTPD security patch <body> Apple released the the patch for an NTPD hole.  This patch is automatically updated if you have SystemPreferences--App Store--Install system data files and security updates; checked. Which we don't.   You used to be able to run in terminal the command:  precode/usr/libexec/XProtectUpdater /code/pre  this would force a check for updates to xprotect.  It seems this command no longer exist in 10.9 and above, is there any other way to force a mac to run the data files and security updates through terminal?  Otherwise a solution to turn on just the check box for "Install system data files and security updates" and leave the rest uncheck.  Apple NTPD patch  <answer163271> Check out this post at macops.ca.  Using:  precode/usr/bin/sudo softwareupdate --background-critical /code/pre  seems to be the answer.  <comment191100> sudo softwareupdate --background-critical  worked prefect.  Does what the old xprotect command did.  Wonder why its not documented in softwareupdate --help
