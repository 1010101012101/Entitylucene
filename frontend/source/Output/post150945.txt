nsurlstoraged and CPU usage <body> Since yesterday codensurlstoraged/code is constantly using a huge amount of CPU. Nothing shows up in the logs but codeopensnoop/code shows that the process is accessing  precode/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Caches/com.apple.mail/fsCachedData /code/pre  The directory contains XML files from the beginning of the month (from October 1. at 8:12) up to now (growing). I now have more than 9 GB of cached data and a new file is created every 2-3 seconds.  After a reboot the codensurlstoraged/code starts again with the same behaviour.  Any idea on how to stop it or on when it will stop by itself?  <answer158722> This solved the issue for me:  ul liMake sure you have a recent backup/li liQuit Safari (if it is running)/li liIn Finder, type kbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd and enter code~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/code/li liA Finder window will open, with the codecom.apple.Safari/code folder selected/li liDelete the whole folder/li liRestart Safari/li /ul  <comment177731> I've been having the same problem since the early Yosemite betas. So far the only thing I've found to help is keeping an eye on it and using Force Quit in Activity Monitor when it gets out of hand. <comment183620> Add me to the list of people having the issue as well, although *I* don't even have a /Library/Containers directory.  What I can tell you is that this is happening on a 1 week old rMBP that shipped with Mavericks and was upgraded to Yosemite release. <comment215570> But that help you per hour or is permanently? <comment325010> Thanks, it also helps with other weird Safari stuff! ;)
