How to upload photos taken from iPhone to iCloud Photo Library? <body> I want to upload photos I take in iPhone to iCloud Photo Library automatically. I set codeiCloud Photo Library/code to on in iPhone's codePhotos &amp; Camera/code Settings.  However, although all photos I capture using a simultaneous hold on emHome button/em and emPower button/em are uploaded automatically to the iCloud Photo Library, photos I take manually using emCamera/em app are NOT uploaded.   Also, the videos I take using the same emCamera/em app are uploaded automatically.  Why are photos not uploaded properly? What am I missing here?  <answer213860> Set "Upload to My Photo Stream" on in Photos and Camera Settings
