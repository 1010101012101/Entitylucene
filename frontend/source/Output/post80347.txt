How to know which directory contains the file that I'm editing in TextEdit? <body> Very basic question - I am editing a file using the basic system TextEdit app.  As I actually have the file in question in several locations, how can I tell what directory the one that I am editing is actually residing in.  In Linux and Windows I can find this out easily but this does not seem obvious on my Mac.  This is using the basic TextEdit on my Mac and my Mac is OSX Lion 10.7.5  <answer80348> Hold down the Command or Ctrl key and click on the icon or file name in the center of the title bar of text edit's document window.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dg1kO.png" alt="Text edit screen shot showing the document&#39;s filesystem path"  Be sure to click on the title itself. The containing directory structure will be shown in reverse-hierarchical order.  <answer80419> They're called Folder Proxies, and do amazing little things.   Hold down the Option key on a Proxy, it turns dark and become dragable, to movie, copy, make an alias.  Related: In Safari, holding down Command on the title reveals the path up the site.  I'm sure there's more ...  <comment92738> @Mark, Michael's answer is correct (even though I don't understand why he asks and answers it himself) in general. Which editor are you using? <comment92750> patrix, I did this because I find it hard to 'guess' this, the answer was not obvious and I had to ask a co-worker to find it out.  Once I know the answer I utilized the 'answer your own question' feature as I write the question.  I did this so that other people with the same question will have an answer and not be mystified the way I was :) <comment92766> Great work @MichaelDurrant - It's a hard line to judge what phrase will work for someone who doesn't know the answer of a question. Sometimes the person with the knowledge to answer can't be a good judge of how the issue presents to another. +1 on both Q and A and editing in deteils. <comment92772> Sure, I added a bit more about it being related to TextEdit in the question. <comment92774> I usually tell people to Command click to do that. I was surprised that control click works too. Thanks, I learned something today. <comment92790> Mark (first Mark above) - maybe you weren't right over the title?  Added that.
