Install Apache, PHP and MySQL on Mac w/o MacPorts? <body> For some reason I can't use MacPorts. So the question is if it's possible to install Apache, PHP and MySQL on Snow Leopard w/o using MacPorts?  Please don't offer MAMP or other bundles.  Thanks in advance.  <answer64656> Yes, Apache and PHP already come by default with a Mac OS X installation, and you can download an installer for MySQL on their website.  For a configuration guide, have a look at this related answer:  How to turn Mac OS X Lion into a web server?  The linked answer also applies to Mac OS X Snow Leopard.  Another popular (and imo superior) way of running development environments is running a Linux server with your preferred configuration in a VirtualBox virtual machine. Vagrant makes this workflow even easier. This is a very flexible solution, as you can easily add custom extensions and more specifically for one project, without messing with one centralized install.  <comment75945> Why donâ€™t you want MAMP? <comment76034> That's just what I needed. Thanks a lot.
