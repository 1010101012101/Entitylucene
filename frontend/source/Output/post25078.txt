How do I extract an ECM archive in Mac OS X Lion? <body> I came across a ECM archive that I need to extract.br The Unarchiver can't handle this format, and I'm not sure about other utilities.  How do I extract ECM in Mac OS X Lion?  <answer25079> You can use the ECM tools created by Neill Corlett, the creator of ECM. Just run "unecm" on the file.  There are binaries for Mac here  If that seems intimidating, there is a youtube walkthrough here that uses a GUI and contains links to the tools used.  <comment28254> Thanks, this is precisely what I was looking for. <comment30610> Hey dan did you get this to work? i just bought a mac and it's lion as well. but when i follow that youtube video and try to open the GUI it gives me the error that powerpc isnt supported anymore. help anyone? <comment79890> +1 for command line tools. The video is down though <comment153020> Note that ecm is also available via HomeBrew. <comment165777> The binary link is broken, but Homebrew still works good! (thanks @TimVisher) <comment235757> To update for 2015: ```brew install ecm; ecm *.ecm;``` and you're good to go!
