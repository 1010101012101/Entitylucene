Disable Apple Pay/Wallet spam <body> How do I disable this annoying spam??  I've never used Apple Pay, nor do I have any intention of doing so. But apparently, after upgrading to an iPhone 6, Apple's gonna spam me every 24 hours?  There was some other garbage spam I had to disable too, but can't figure this one out... Pretty annoying that Apples so aggressively peddling their services these days. You'd think a simple opt in/out during onboarding would suffice.  Anyone have any ideas how to disable this?

Toggle Allow Notifications to off.  <comment321006> Well... That was surprisingly obvious... Thanks!
