Are Swift Playgrounds compatible with macOS and iPad? <body> Are playgrounds created in Xcode compatible with the iPad Playgrounds app? That is, can I drop it into the iPad app's Documents folder (or otherwise use iCloud Drive, etc) to load a playground created in Xcode?  Googling neither confirms nor deny this.  <answer290882> I just tried running one on my iPad Air downloaded from this Swift Blog post as well as the ones found on the Resources Page and most of them just returned errors. You may see the attached image. Tests were run on iPad Air running iOS 11 Dev Beta &amp; XCode playground Beta.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t6qZY.png" alt="&lt;code&gt;Error:Sources/CoreGraphicsDiagramView.swift:2: no such module: ‘XCPlayground’&lt;/code&gt;"  <comment367257> How about the *released* versions? Xcode 8.3 Playground and iPad Playground 1.5, on Swift 3.1 sources. <comment367279> Nope. Tried on my moms iPad to see... didnt work. Same error.
