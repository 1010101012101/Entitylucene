Numbers: Count unique items in a column <body> I'd like to count the occurrence of unique items found in one column of about 120 items. I  can't find a way to do this in Numbers.app  <answer55662> Here is a clever solution posted in an apple discussions thread.  You basically create another column, and use the formula code=IF(COUNTIF(A$1:A1, A2)=0,1,"")/code. This will display a one for the first occurrence of each unique item. You then simply sum the whole column and you get your count.  <answer55685> If it doesn't have to be updated dynamically, you might also copy the cells and run something like codepbpaste | sort | uniq | wc -l/code.  <comment63885> Currently, if I do this calculation in the footer row, or another table, they both show up as "0" <comment64060> Works great! Thank you. <comment64061> Shows up as "0" because I'm not sure how to use the Count function really well. <comment64556> Your Welcome! :) <comment214778> why do you need sort? <comment261594> @CousinCocaine you need `sort` because `uniq` only detects repeated lines immediately following each other, not repeated lines anywhere in the input stream. See [`uniq` man page](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/uniq.1.html). <comment278761> You can also use `sort -u` instead of `sort | uniq` <comment278762> Copy the column and run `pbpaste| sort | uniq -c` in a terminal. <comment359829> This is extremely slow when there's lots of data. If that's the case, you can import your data into Google Spreadsheets and use `=COUNTUNIQUE(A:A)` <comment360104> This one is always better than clunky gui, thanks for the reminder bro!
