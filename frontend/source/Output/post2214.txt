How can I turn off the photo preview when I plugin in my iPhone on my PC? <body> When I plug in my iPhone 3GS into my Windows XP machine, it automatically opens up Word and displays a preview of all my photos from my phone.  I believe I may have accidentally selected an option to always do that. How do I turn it off?   <answer2215> ol liConnect your phone to the computer./li liIn Windows, click Start  Settings  Control Panel  Scanners and Cameras./li liRight-click on "Apple iPhone"  Properties./li liClick the tab "Events"./li liClick the radio button "Take no action". Then OK./li /ol  Now when you connect the phone, nothing should happen.  <comment1867> Wait, it opens *word*? Do you mean Microsoft Word? That sounds very odd! <comment1868> @torbengb It's entirely possible Word would have gotten associated as the default action. You've never had a user email a screenshot pasted into a Word document? I used to get them all the time... <comment1869> I see Word-embedded screenshots weekly, but I've never before seen the Scanner-and-Camera thing default to Word.
