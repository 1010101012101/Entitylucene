A jabber chat client that displays a list of rooms? <body> I'm on OS X 10.6.6, and I've tried strikeAdium and/strike iChat, but strikeneither are/strike iChat isn't capable of showing a list of available rooms anywhere on our company chat server. Does anyone know of a Jabber chat client that can? Thanks!  strongUpdate/strong: See my answer at the bottom of the page ;)  Yes strongAdium/strong can!  <answer8439> The only client I've come across that does this is Psi. There's a "Service Discovery" item in the menus, and browsing the conference/muc bridge interface SHOULD list all the registered rooms.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ilh7h.jpg" alt="Service Discovery Window for My XMPP Server"  <answer9355> So the answer to my question emis/em to use strongAdium/strong. A stronglucky discovery/strong: I was about to disconnect my chat account using the File menu, but when I moused over the text "Disconnect: ...", a context menu appeared as one might expect. However, I had never clicked the item labeled strongDiscovery Browser/strong. Under the server's "Public Chatrooms" I found a list with the JID of all the active chat rooms.  <comment9058> Thanks, but that didn't work for me. Looks like it hasn't been an actively developed piece of software for a couple of years either. <comment9083> This is unfortunately true. The actual active Psi developers switched Swift, but it's supposed to be "simple" and I believe it won't have the option you seek. <comment9085> If Psi did not work (and the "Automatically Get Info" box was checked at the bottom, it is the default), I suspect your server does not allow node browsing. I posted a screenshot of my Jabber Server, and you'll see that the rooms that actually have people in it are listed. <comment9444> @Dori thanks for the retag! Hopefully, someone will know the answer to this soon. I hope Psi isn't the only option.  For whatever reason it didn't work, and my IT guy couldn't confirm that the server wasn't configured correctly as @VxJasonxV suggested. <comment97461> I don't see the "Public Chatrooms" option. <comment97631> @SteveMoser You won't see "Public Chatrooms" if you're using the google chat service.  I no longer use Adium with public chatrooms, because I no longer work at a job that has public chatrooms.  I apologize if my answer didn't apply to your situation.  Best of luck!
