How to set default application for special link types (e.g., ssh://)? <body> Some applications will signal to the OS that they can open special link type, such as codessh:///code or codegithub-mac:///code.  They get automatically opened for such links by the web browser (or when using codeopen/code in a terminal).  If I have multiple such applications, how can I set which one should be the default?  For example, both GitHub Desktop and SourceTree can handle codegithub-mac:///code. When I installed GitHub Desktop, it became the default handler for these links.  How can I set SourceTree as the default handler without uninstalling GitHub Desktop?  <answer238048> You can do that with a freeware app called RCDefaultApp. It's ancient, but still works on El Capitan.  You can define the default app for any URL scheme.  I don't have one for github, but this shows how you can set, for example, ftps specifically to any installed app that supports the protocol.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A7gnn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer262047> You can also try this: https://onflapp.wordpress.com/lincastor/. It allows you to register arbitrary url schemes such as codechrome-devtools:///code
