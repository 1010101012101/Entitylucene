how can I use applescript to type? <body> how can I use applescript to type in a specified area on the screen? I've tried the 'keystroke' command, but it doesn't seem to work. also, how can I use applescript to display an image? thanks a lot if you answer. here's the code I have so far:  precodeset theText to text returned of (display dialog "Put what you want to autotype here." default answer "" buttons {"OK", "cancel"} default button 1) display dialog "select where you want me to type " &amp; theText &amp; " Your text will be typed in the area selected. you have 10 seconds to select once you click 'OK'" buttons {"OK"} delay 10 say "typing" --command for typing here end end end /code/pre  <answer194622> script from a forum.  precodetell application "System Events"     set textToType to "text here"     delay 3      repeat         delay 1         keystroke textToType         keystroke return     end repeat end tell /code/pre  soruce: http://www.sythe.org/runescape-scripts/1590890-auto-typer-script-mac.html  Replace within the quotes of "text here" to what ever you need. If you have multiple lines of text to auto type, then add more codeset textToType2 to "text here 2"/code and codekeystroke textToType2/code codekeystroke return/code  Also with basic coding knowledge you can change a few parts to your choice. I've tried this script and works really well, however not as the best one for Windows only, rsclient.exe  <comment232123> i think you need to learn to walk before you can run. Try a beginner's guide - http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-applescript--mac-3436 or http://macosxautomation.com/applescript/firsttutorial/index.html would be a fair start. Also, Ask Different is designed for one Question, one Answer. Multiple Questions need to be split. You also need to show what research you have done so far & what specific issue you are facing. Questions that are too broad will just be closed. <comment232157> sorry, but that's not helpful a bit. <comment232307> Which problem are you trying to solve in the end using the script (e.g. what is this "specified area": a window, a dialog box, something else)? Also your script seems to be syntactically incorrect, is it taken out of a bigger script?
