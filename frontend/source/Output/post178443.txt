iTunes 12 Turn off Repeat Song and Repeat Playlist Separately <body> The last answer in this thread makes iTunes 12 shortcuts for shuffle (on and off), but I was wondering if it were possible to make shortcuts for turning on the repeat playlist, song, and turning off repeat. By doing 'Off' (as it appears in the menu) it only affects the shuffle command.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <answer238371> In earlier versions of iTunes, "repeat" and "shuffle" were associated with playlists.  With iTunes 12 they are global flags and seem to be toggled by menu clicks; there's no direct property to manipulate.  You can control repeat from Applescript thus:  precodetell application "System Events"   tell application process "iTunes"     tell menu 1 of menu item "Repeat" of menu "Controls" of menu bar 1       click       click menu item "All"     end tell   end tell end tell /code/pre  Options are "All", "One" or "Off"  You can do similar for "Shuffle" with allowed options of "On" or "Off"  precodetell application "System Events"   tell application process "iTunes"     tell menu 1 of menu item "Shuffle" of menu "Controls" of menu bar 1       click       click menu item "On"     end tell   end tell end tell /code/pre  This makes it scriptable to control the status of shuffle and repeat, and you could bind these scripts to keyboard shortcuts.  <comment211365> I'd have a look at [Doug's Applescripts](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/). General consensus is, if it's not on there, it can't be done ;)
