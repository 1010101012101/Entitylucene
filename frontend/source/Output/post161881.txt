Can not reinstall Windows7 (using Boot camp) after i've removed Bootcamp partition via Disk Utility <body> I've removed codeWindows/code partition (might be label as codeBootcamp/code) using codeDisk Utility/code. and after that i found that i made some mistake because in actually i should remove it via codeBootcamp Assistant/code. What's wrong with me now?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BcLOF.png" alt="enter image description here"  I couldn't find installation menu on codeBootcamp/code there's only remove menu. In my understanding i think because codeBootcamp/code now still remember the starting file or boot file of codeWindows/code.  Additional Information from codediskutil list/code command:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            300.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5    4:       Microsoft Basic Data WINDOWS_HD              199.2 GB   disk0s4 /code/pre  strongNOTE/strong codeWINDOWS_HD/code i just create it from codeDisk Utility/code program there is nothing inside just blank space no Windows.  <answer161886> OK, now i got my installation screen back  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jnHKO.png" alt="enter image description here"  How could i solve this problem?  I just remove a blank NTFS partition (label as codeWINDOWS_HD/code) and leave it be a free space. That's all.  <comment189113> Please start `Terminal.app` enter `diskutil list` (followed by return key), copy the output and add it to your question. <comment189117> @klanomath Information is update sir. <comment189122> Then just remove Windows 7 with the Bootcamp Assistant. Check back with `diskutil list` if "Macintosh HD" has been extended to full size. Then start the `Bootcamp Assistant` again and install Windows 7 <comment189124> No, @klanomath that should not work because what it recommend me to remove is my `OS X` partition not `Windows` only one choice it give me. <comment189129> Please post a screenshot of that choice
