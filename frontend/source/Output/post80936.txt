Mac OS X app for measuring time spent in apps <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there an app that allows me to monitor time spent using an application?       Is there app which will tell me that for example, today I spent 30 minutes in Safari, 1 hour in XCode, etc... Thanks  <answer80938> Take a look at Timesink by ManyTricks. I've used it for years and it's perfect for tracking where you spend your time on your mac.  <comment93330> A google search for `time tracker mac` gave me this: [http://www.rescuetime.com](http://www.rescuetime.com) Didn't use it, but according to it's page it does what you want. <comment110889> [*Time Sink*](http://manytricks.com/timesink/) seems to do this job — a job that I find useless —, and costs only 5 little dollars. <comment110890> [*Tictoc*](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tictoc/id412307572?mt=12) keeps track of time spent in tasks, rather than in applications. Which starts to be a little more useful. <comment267547> [Apps Usage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apps-usage/id1068673201?mt=12) is an app for Mac users, who want to know, how much time they spent on each used application. It can be a good solution for you.
