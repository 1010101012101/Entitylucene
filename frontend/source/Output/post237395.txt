Boot Windows from USB with EFI password <body> I've created an USB with Windows 10 from where I can boot:  ol liRestart pressing kbdoption/kbd./li liSelect USB EFI partition./li liWindows starts./li /ol  When EFI password is active it will be asked when booting pressing the kbdoption/kbd key, and unless I know the password I can't boot using a different partition.  I tried to set Windows as Startup Disk using System Preferences, but end up with this error:     remove disk or other media press any key to restart   Is there any alternative to boot Windows from USB without pressing the kbdoption/kbd key, but behaves the same way and I'm not asked for the EFI password?  hr  Here are some details, I'm on a MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013) running OSX El Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21). Booting using a USB 3 with Windows 10.  <comment290707> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it appears to be a question about the Microsoft Windows operating system. <comment290708> I've made edits to your question replacing "alt" with "option" as it's the paradigm Apple uses. See: [Startup key combinations for Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255) Additionally, there is no reason the enlarge and bold the question, as readers will see it just fine written normally! <comment290711> @IconDaemon, While this question is about booting Windows, nonetheless it's being asked in the context of doing so on Apple Hardware and therefore IMO is not necessarily off topic since Apple and OS X do support installing Windows via Boot Camp Assistant and running Windows on Apple Hardware. <comment290716> @user3439894 - agreed. <comment292285> Is your objective to always boot to Windows on the external drive when first starting your Mac? If your answer is yes, then have tried using the `bless` command. If so and that failed, have you tried using rEFInd installed to your EFI partition.
