How does appannie collect their app store rankings? <body> App Annie claims ranks go up as high as 1500. Using the charts apple provides (example: codehttps://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStoreServices.woa/ws/charts?g=12002&amp;name=MacAppsByRevenue&amp;cc=au&amp;limit=1500/code), I can get up to 400. I'm wondering if anyone knows of other urls that can be queried to get rankings for apps that may be further down the chain?
