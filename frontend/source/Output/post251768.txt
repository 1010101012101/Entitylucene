New external HD and strange error messages in console during Time Machine backup <body> I have a 2 TB external HD that I've been using for Time Machine backups for more than a year now with no trouble.  The drive was nearly full, so I recently purchased a new 3 TB external HD and decided to switch over to using that one.  I have tried three different methods (detail below) and in every case I have had the same issue.  The issue is this: the backup runs emextremely/em slowly (like, on the order of emkilobytes/em per minute), and every fifteen seconds a pair of error messages shows up in my console.  I have reproduced four such pairs below so that you can see their content and regularity, but trust me, this can go on for hours:  precode9/6/16 9:09:10.000 PM kernel[0]: /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/AppleFSCompression_kexts/AppleFSCompression-81.20.2/Compressors/Dataless/compressorType5Kext.c:545: Error: post_request error for /Volumes/Wells/Backups.backupdb/mweiss/2016-09-06-204200.inProgress/6722B6D0-88EE-402E-A32F-B064825E7254/mweiss hd/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/505/4b3/com.apple.documentVersions/AA103B78-774A-4CD3-9311-7874923EA143.tex: 35     9/6/16 9:09:10.000 PM kernel[0]: decmpfs.c:1385:decmpfs_read_compressed: /Volumes/Wells/Backups.backupdb/mweiss/2016-09-06-204200.inProgress/6722B6D0-88EE-402E-A32F-B064825E7254/mweiss hd/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/505/4b3/com.apple.documentVersions/AA103B78-774A-4CD3-9311-7874923EA143.tex: decmpfs_fetch_uncompressed_data err -35   9/6/16 9:09:25.000 PM kernel[0]: /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/AppleFSCompression_kexts/AppleFSCompression-81.20.2/Compressors/Dataless/compressorType5Kext.c:545: Error: post_request error for /Volumes/Wells/Backups.backupdb/mweiss/2016-09-06-204200.inProgress/6722B6D0-88EE-402E-A32F-B064825E7254/mweiss hd/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/505/4b3/com.apple.documentVersions/AEEA8040-5F7E-43FF-837A-B1EA3FDAFD8F.tex: 35     9/6/16 9:09:25.000 PM kernel[0]: decmpfs.c:1385:decmpfs_read_compressed: /Volumes/Wells/Backups.backupdb/mweiss/2016-09-06-204200.inProgress/6722B6D0-88EE-402E-A32F-B064825E7254/mweiss hd/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/505/4b3/com.apple.documentVersions/AEEA8040-5F7E-43FF-837A-B1EA3FDAFD8F.tex: decmpfs_fetch_uncompressed_data err -35     9/6/16 9:09:40.000 PM kernel[0]: /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/AppleFSCompression_kexts/AppleFSCompression-81.20.2/Compressors/Dataless/compressorType5Kext.c:545: Error: post_request error for /Volumes/Wells/Backups.backupdb/mweiss/2016-09-06-204200.inProgress/6722B6D0-88EE-402E-A32F-B064825E7254/mweiss hd/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/505/4b3/com.apple.documentVersions/C93BEE9D-AA66-42BA-BB04-836330F5B1D7.tex: 35     9/6/16 9:09:40.000 PM kernel[0]: decmpfs.c:1385:decmpfs_read_compressed: /Volumes/Wells/Backups.backupdb/mweiss/2016-09-06-204200.inProgress/6722B6D0-88EE-402E-A32F-B064825E7254/mweiss hd/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/505/4b3/com.apple.documentVersions/C93BEE9D-AA66-42BA-BB04-836330F5B1D7.tex: decmpfs_fetch_uncompressed_data err -35     9/6/16 9:09:55.000 PM kernel[0]: /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/AppleFSCompression_kexts/AppleFSCompression-81.20.2/Compressors/Dataless/compressorType5Kext.c:545: Error: post_request error for /Volumes/Wells/Backups.backupdb/mweiss/2016-09-06-204200.inProgress/6722B6D0-88EE-402E-A32F-B064825E7254/mweiss hd/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/505/4b4/com.apple.documentVersions/3A6603FE-CD30-4238-BA32-1488C2BF3F34.pdf: 35     9/6/16 9:09:55.000 PM kernel[0]: decmpfs.c:1385:decmpfs_read_compressed: /Volumes/Wells/Backups.backupdb/mweiss/2016-09-06-204200.inProgress/6722B6D0-88EE-402E-A32F-B064825E7254/mweiss hd/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/505/4b4/com.apple.documentVersions/3A6603FE-CD30-4238-BA32-1488C2BF3F34.pdf: decmpfs_fetch_uncompressed_data err -35 /code/pre  If I switch back to my old Time Machine drive, everything works fine.  So whatever is causing this behavior, it is definitely associated with using the new drive.  I have tried adding the new hard drive to the Spotlight exclusions pane, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.  Now, here are the three methods I have tried, in the order I have tried them:  ol liI tried to do a clean, start-from-scratch TM backup on the new drive.  After two hours it had still copied less than 2 MB of data, so I gave up./li liThen I tried to copy the Backups.backupdb folder from the old TM drive to the new one, using the method described at this link.  It took a emvery/em long time for the Finder to copy all 2 TB of data -- almost two days! -- but it did finally copy over.  The first time I started a TM backup to the new drive, I had the exact same behavior./li liMy third attempt was to use Disk Utility to restore the contents of the old 2 TB drive onto the new 3 TB drive.  Again this took a long time -- about a day and a half -- but once completed I started a TM backup.  Same behavior./li /ol  At this point I'm not sure what else to do.  Those Console messages are telling me emsomething/em, but I don't know what.  Again, to reiterate backups to the old drive continue to work with no trouble.
