How do I remove multiple owners from a file/folder? <body> While trying to set up MAMP/PHPStorm, I CHOWNed the OWNER of my Sites folder to _www from myUser. Since this did not resolve the problem I was experiencing, I attempted to codeCHOWN myUser /Users/myUser/Documents/Sites/code... which worked, except emGet Info/em shows both as owners, and codels -l/code reports _www as the (primary?) owner. I could not modify the folder contents, even though myUser is one of the owners.  When I codels -leO@/code as suggested in this answer, I see the following:  precodedrwxr-xr-x+ 31 _www  wheel  -  1054 Dec 5 12:38 Sites   0: user:myUser allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,   writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity /code/pre  I codesudo chown :staff Sites/code thinking this will give myUser more clout, and then codesudo chown myUser: Sites/code which works in removing _www, but I'm left with:  precodeMacBook-Pro:Documents myUser$ ls -leO@ ... drwxr-xr-x+ 31 myUser  staff  -  1054 Dec 5 12:38 Sites   0: user:myUser allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,   writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity ... /code/pre  I've read the MAN page for CHMOD and ACL as suggested in this answer, and I've tried codechmod -a#0 Sites/code and variations with no success. How do I remove the ACL/xattr?  <answer218504> I'm not sure how to do it from Terminal, but you could use a tool like BatChmod to redo the file permissions (and clear ACLs).  http://www.lagentesoft.com/batchmod/  <answer218510> Using chmod from Terminal is the way that worked. What I was doing wrong was a simple spacing error. Compare the code below (which worked) to the code I listed last in my question.  precodechmod -a# 0 Sites /code/pre  If I read the MAN page correctly, I issued the command [codechmod/code] to remove an explicit-numbered ACL [code-a#/code] being number zero [code0/code] from the directory Sites.
