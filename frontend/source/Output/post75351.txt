Right-click causes application crash <body> I have a serious problem with right clicking. When ever I try to open the contextual menu in certain applications like the iWork Suite, MS Office or Evernote, I get the beach ball.   I've completely formated my Mac and 3 days later I notice the problem is persisting. Has anyone ever experienced this issue ?  I am running 10.8.2.  <answer75511> After looking in /Library/Contextual Menu Items/ I noticed that even after uninstalling the app which I suspected was causing the problem, a plugin was still present. Deleting it has resolved the issue.  The app in question was Antidote by Druide Software.  <comment87493> Is there anything interesting in Console? You could try disabling all services in System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services or uninstalling applications that have added other context menu items. <comment87589> Are you using a third-party mouse, Apple mouse, or track-pad? Just curious if you have third-party drivers running as well. eg. Logitech, etc <comment87676> I've uninstalled the Logitech drivers and also an app which I thought might be the cause. Still I am experiencing this problem. Also there are no Services directories in ~/Library/ or /Library/. Where else can I look for possible culprits? <comment88435> Wow merci, j'aurais jamais pensé que c'est ce plugin qui causait le problème ! <comment94622> Won't the French Académie object to the word "plugin"? <comment173423> That fixed my problem too !  Thx <comment179885> Thanks, it worked for me. In french, plugin could be said : module.
