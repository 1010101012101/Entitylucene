syncing songs from iPhone 4s to Mac <body> I've brought a load of music on my iPhone and have now just purchased a MacBook pro. What is the standard way of transferring songs from iPhone to Mac? Do I need to download all these programs or is there an easier way that I am missing?   <answer90462> Just enable "Automatic Downloads" in the iTunes preferences after having your computer authorized.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wtIjp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Ref : Apple Support : iTunes Store: How to enable Automatic Downloads  <comment108221> where have you bought the music from?
