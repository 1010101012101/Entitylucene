Network/Computer Compromised <body> My Terminal is now showing me this: codeChelle-VAIO:~ MyUsername$/code  It was only until now that I noticed the hostname had changed from my original hostname to codeChelle-VAIO/code, I'm pretty sure that there is no computer named like that in my network (or at least any that I know of). It goes back to my original hostname if I open another tab.  I'm on a MBP 8,2 running macOS Sierra and my network setup is also as follows:  codeISP Modem -&gt; Wireless Repeater -&gt; Switch -&gt; MBP/code  Here's an excerpt from system.log showing the hostname change: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Gww8.png" alt="system.log"  Is my computer/network compromised?  <comment322715> Check the Users panel of system preferences. If there are no users present, then likely not. To change a hostname, try going to the sharing tab and change it back. The alternative is that you have connected via SSH to another machine on your network.
