Why can't I access the power management dialog with standard keyboard shortcuts? <body> So at some point in time, say in the last 18 months, all of my Macs (iMac 27" 2010 and MacBook Pro 13" 2009), which have been running the latest available OS updates, stopped responding as expected to the standard keyboard shortcuts for power management (as described here https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201236).  When I press Ctrl+Media Eject I expect to see this power management dialog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mSAXm.png" alt="enter image description here"  This dialog still comes up BUT ONLY if there is one and only one user logged into the computer. If there is more than one user logged in to the machine I get this dialog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMcqF.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is definitely no the behaviour that I remember. What used to happen is I would get the first dialog regardless of the number of logged in users and only when I chose "Shut Down" I would get the second dialog. There is no mention on Apple's pages that the shortcut will behave differently when multiple users are logged in simultaneously.  It was a very fast and convenient way to access the "sleep" functionality with just a couple of key strokes (Ctrl+Eject, S).   Has anyone else experienced this change in behaviour? Have you found a way to restore the original behaviour?
