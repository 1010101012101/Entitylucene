This is just a suggestion. Jailbreaking has it's own set of pros and cons.   This issue can be fixed by updating the codecarrier.plist/code file. This requires your iPhone to be jailbroken on iOS 8.  ul liDownload strongCommCenter/strong tweak from Cydia from repo codeapt.chinasnow.net/code/li liInstall strongiFile/strong from Cydia, now using iFile goto code/var/mobile/Library/Carrier Bundle.bundle/code/li liOpen carrier.plist file using property list viewer, click on the "+" to add a new entry/li liType codeAllowsVoIP/code and set it type to emboolean/em from emstring/em and create it/li liTurn on codeAllowsVoIP/code in the carrier.plist file and click done/li /ul  After you've done that reboot the iPhone and Facetime app should appear. If not, reboot the iPhone once more and check over at codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions/code for FaceTime option.
