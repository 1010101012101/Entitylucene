How can I boot my MacBook Pro from a DVD to update my SSD firmware <body> I have a MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 (mid-2011 model) running OS X 10.8.2.  I upgraded to an SSD which I bought from Crucial and works just great.  Crucial sent an email recommending I upgrade my firmware to get even better performance from my SSD.   I downloaded the firmware to my desktop in the form of an ISO file from the Crucial website, and the instructions told me to burn this to a disk and change my boot order in order to boot from this disk.  I burned the disk but subsequently have not been able to get a bios screen or to be able to boot from the DVD I created.  I have tried holding down the C key but nothing seems to happen.    What do I need to do to complete the installation of the firmware?  <answer68818> You should know there is no such this as "BIOS" on a Mac (the equivalent system is called EFI, but you don't boot into it to change settings). To boot from a DVD or any other external medium, you'll have to hold down the kbdOption ‚å•/kbd key while booting.br Then you'll get a list with all the bootable devices and there you can select the device you want to boot from.   Or you can go to System Preferences  Startup Disk to select your disk and then reboot. Then you'll also boot from the disk.  <answer68822> The guide provided by Crucial here is quite PC-hardware centric, that's why they talk about BIOS, I guess. Forget BIOS in a Mac context.  You say you burned a DVD. I've downloaded the ISO file from the update page, burned a CD and strongI couldn't boot from it either/strong when pressing 'C' upon restart (as explained here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533]. The CD spun, but except for the noise nothing happened. (I own a Macbook Pro 2.2 GHZ Intel Core i7 (early 2011)).  I've checked the ISO file, it is a Linux boot CD that I suspect is not tuned for Mac hardware. I'd say contact Crucial customer support.  (The guide states:     Firmware version 010G includes improvements which are specific for   Windows 8 and new UltraBook systems, although Windows 7 and other   operating systems and computer platforms may also see improvements.   so maybe you are not missing much...)  <comment79951> Thanks I'll let them know but I didn't realize how windoze specific the update is so I guess I will just leave it be. <comment79952> I didn't know any of that so thanks.  I unfortunately can't vote up the answer until my rep goes up but will then.  In this situation my disk does not show up in the startup disk window so I think as jaume pointed out this image is just not good for a MAC and I would have no confidence in it anyway at this point. <comment80106> Just to complete this topic here is the reply from Crucial:                                     Thank you for your email. A Firmware update should only be done if it addresses a certain issue and this new Firmware update isn't needed for the Macbook Pro.  Our Firmware tool is compatible with a MAC and it sounds like the ISO file hasn't downloaded as it should have.  If you want to go ahead with the update then I would recommend trying the download again or connecting the drive to a Windows based system and trying again.  If you have any further questions or need further help, just let us know. <comment80207> Just wanted to share this: I inserted the firmware CD my Mac couldn't boot from into my wife's PC (Dell Inspiron / Windows 7) and it booted into the Crucial firmware tool without a hitch.
