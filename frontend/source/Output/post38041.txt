Subscribe to an Lion/iCal/iCloud calendar from a Google calendar <body> Trying to subscribe to a shared iCal/iCloud calendar from a colleagues Google Calendar. Is this possible? It was easy under MobileMe but I can't seem to get it working under iCloud.  <comment43143> As far as I can tell, you can only subscribe to calendars you have editing permissions for, so you'd need to have your colleague sign in to Google Calendar on your computer.
