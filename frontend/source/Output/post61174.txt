Can't open example files in LyX (greyed out) <body> I am trying to bring up LyX on a mac. One of the first things in the tutorial is to go look at the file named codeexample_raw.lyx/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhOrs.png" alt="enter image description here"    I know the file is on my machine because I found it using terminal, i.e., codefind / name "example_raw.lyx" -print 2&gt; /dev/null/code reveals that the file is in code/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources/examples/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QXeCG.png" alt="enter image description here"  But, when I try to open it from the LyX GUI, there doesn't seem to be any way for me to navigate to the folder that contains the file -- everything inside code/Applications/code is greyed out and denies any kind of clicking; I tried all thirty-two combinations of option, command, control, shift and double versus single clicking.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vg6YQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I suspect this is more of a general question concerning the open-dialog on Mac.  I am VERY NEW to the Macintosh GUI even though I know Unix well and Windows well.  I'll take any solution to this problem, either specific or general: a way just to keyboard in the path I want, or some way to click around that will let me get to my stuff, or some LyX-specific solution that gets me access to their examples.    All this user-friendliness is frustrating :)  <answer61181> emIf LyX utilizes the Open File dialog appropriately/em, you should be able to visit any path directly via the Finder shortcut kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdG/kbd.  Tab completion works in the resulting path dialog.    emIf LyX does not allow browsing via path,/em I would just copy the files to a temporary directory to bypass the difficulty.   strongSidebar/strong Mac OS is full of very handy keyboard shortcuts that work fairly consistently.  See this link for a fairly comprehensive list.
