I can't get Pages > ePub to work like the Apple template suggests <body> I've read through all the relevant discussions I could find, and while I've learned a lot (thank you) I am still having a major problem.  I'm tryingt o export a book-length Pages manuscript to the ePub format. I've had some success, but I can't seem to get the chapter titles correct. When I open the new document in iBooks on iPad, chapters aren't linking to the TOC (sometimes the first one will) and they don't reflect page break or section breaks, either.  Part of my confusuin comes from the instructions on the "E-pub Best Practices" document. Somehow if I delete the existing text as instructed, I delete the predefined styles as well. Since the Chapter Name style is precisely what I want, I always go back and delete only the first couple of pages, then paste my text in and finally delete the remainder after I'm done.  This would be simpler if I understood how to create a Chapter Name/TOC linked style on my own, but I don't. I have been changing the typography on the predetermined style to make it smaller (redefine from selection) and that seems to work fine.  Sorry to ask rookie questions, but ... well, I'm a rookie.  Thanks for any assistance.  P.S. To Apple: I'm not a dumb guy, but the instructions on the Best Practices document simply are not clear to me.  "...delete the instructions and add your own content to the next page: Replace the existing styled paragraphs by typing or pasting in your own text..."  Does that mean delete everything on the template page? Sounds like it. But if I do I also delete some of the styles I need to make it work.  I'm bamboozled.  <comment25165> Could you provide a link to the Best Practices document <comment25169> What version of Pages are you using, and what version of Mac OS X? <comment25171> The document I'm referencing can be downloaded here: http://images.apple.com/support/pages/docs/ePub_Best_Practices_EN.zip <comment25172> I am running 10.7.1 OSX and Pages 4.1.
