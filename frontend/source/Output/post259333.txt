Resized Bootcamp Partition <body> I resized my bootcamp partition using the minitool partition wizard (I've later discovered this wasn't the correct way to do it, I know) and now the bootcamp partition does not show up in OS X, and I can't mount it.  Also, in disk utility, the 100GB that I added to the bootcamp partition is still shown as unallocated.  Is there a way to fix this?  Cheers
