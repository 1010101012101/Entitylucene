Blank screen after Bootcamp procedure <body> I'm trying to install Windows 7 using Bootcamp.  My computer is a iMac with Yosemite.  First challenge was create a USB Stick with Window Image, because my Bootcamp didn't give me this option. I solved with this post: Bootcamp - No ISO Option   Everything worked fine, but after the restart I get a blank screen and after few seconds I get the message in a black screen: No bootable disk found (or something like that).   So, I need to restart holding Alt key, to select the OSX disk.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qFxKJ.png" alt="Partition after run Bootcamp"  I'm stuck after this.
