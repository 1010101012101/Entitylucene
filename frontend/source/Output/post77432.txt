Location of Message Attachments in iOS 6 Backup? <body> I'm trying to get all my Messages (not E-Mail) and connected attachments out of a iOS 6 backup. I know there are tools like Wondershare Data Recovery for iTunes but they are not cheap and I'm trying to do this by my self with a self written python script.  I already know that the backups are stored here:     ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/   And in a specific backup (XY) the messages are stored in this file:     ~/Library/Application   Support/MobileSync/Backup/XY/3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28   This is a SQlite database file, so I can access it in different ways (e.g. SQLite Manager add-on for Firefox).  Now where are the attachments? In the messages database file above I found a table called "attachment" and "message_attachment_join" which helps to get the right attachments to a single message. But the path in "attachment" is like:     /var/mobile/Library/SMS/Attachments/5D58C5EE-8F51-445C-A3FC-D6X94B6B6932/IMG_1230.png   I think this is the path on the iPhone. Where are all this files backuped to? In a backup directory I found three big files about 1.5 to 2.5 GB. Maybe they are stored there? But in which format, as a ZIP or TAR?  Does somebody know where I can find this files?  <answer80195> To close this question: With this free extract tool I can extract the filestructure like: codevar/mobile/Library/SMS/Attachments/*/code  <answer117230> Given your file:  precode/var/mobile/Library/SMS/Attachments/5D58C5EE-8F51-445C-A3FC-D6X94B6B6932/IMG_1230.png /code/pre  Replace the codevar/mobile//code with codeMediaDomain-/code so that you end up with this:  precodeMediaDomain-Library/SMS/Attachments/5D58C5EE-8F51-445C-A3FC-D6X94B6B6932/IMG_1230.png /code/pre  Take the SHA1 hash of the above filename and that should be the name of the file in your backup: codee6f11db0844899e5f8a04a796c74c234a3dcc5bc/code  To get the hash for testing, try the following link: http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm   <comment89812> found a very helpfull [article](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/ios-5-backups-part-1/) on iOS backup structure and a [free extract tool](http://supercrazyawesome.com/). But no answer to my question yet :) <comment89822> With the tool I mentioned I can extract the filestructure like `var/mobile/Library/SMS/Attachments/*` so I'm able to get the files now, but still no clue without this extract tool. I asked the owner if he has time to answer this question. <comment89832> Thank you for the updates. Don't forget, you could always answer your own question, because either way, the extractor worked for you. It might help future visitors as well. <comment149677> I think that the Record structure descripted in the [article](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/ios-5-backups-part-1/) is wrong. I built a PHP script like this but it doesn't work. After I used the structure of @galloglass's answer in [this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3085153/how-to-parse-the-manifest-mbdb-file-in-an-ios-4-0-itunes-backup) it worked. <comment149679> After `inode` there is a `unknown3` missing. <comment248885> Still works for newer paths that start with `~/Library/SMS/...` Thanks!
