Browser with PDF quick-view for 10.4.11 Tiger? <body> Does any web browser that runs on Tiger 10.4.11 (PowerPC) have a "quick view" mode for PDF documents?   Google.com in Firefox 3.6.27 used to (that is, clicking on "quick view" next to codexxx.pdf/code brought up a GoogleÂ PDF viewer that ran under Firefox), but Google seems to have stopped supporting Firefox 3.6 and quick-view too.  (The question What is a good web browser for OS X 10.4 Tiger? lists TenFourFox and Camino; I haven't found a TenFour DMG that works for me yet.)
