how can I receive external display connection notification in launchd? <body> How does one receive notification from codenotifyd/code (or equiv) when the display configuration changes? My goal is to fire off some daemons when connected to my thunderbolt display "dock". Any example scripts gratefully accepted.  Thanks.  <comment133104> I am not sure if this will help, but if any files in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/ are changed when a monitor is attached, then you could use a script to check for display configuration changes. I have done something like that at https://github.com/tjluoma/onnetworkchange for dealing with network changes, but I am not sure if the same thing would work for display changes. <comment133359> @TJLuoma I don't see any changes in SystemConfiguration/.  I see log entries in /var/log/system.log, but that's it.
