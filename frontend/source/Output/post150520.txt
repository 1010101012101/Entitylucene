Album and Artist not showing recent download <body> I pre-ordered an album off iTunes. It became available today. But when I checked my albums on my phone, I saw one song (I had downloaded for free through the bands website) but nothing else was there. When I look in iTunes, it's there.  The songs are on my phone, but only when I look through "songs." If I look for the album, it shows up, but only with one song under it. Same if I go through the artists tab. I'll see the album but not the songs.  I'm wondering if having a non-iTunes version of the song created a bug. I have the songs, I'd just like to get them in the albums and artists tab. Anyone have any idea what happened?
