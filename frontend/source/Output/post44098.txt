How can I save a Pages document as .docx? <body> I've tried to save a pages document as a code*.docx/code for Microsoft Office.  Pages is able to strongopen/strong, strongedit/strong and strong(auto-)save/strong existing code*.docx/code documents. However, there is no option to export or save a duplicate as code*.docx/code?  ul liIs this a missing compability feature and are there plug-ins for pages to add that functionality?/li /ul  <answer44101> This does seem to be a missing feature. As I see it, you have two options:  ol liExport as code*.doc/code using strongFile/strong - strongExport/strong. While not ideal, I imagine almost everything that supports code*.docx/code also supports code*.doc/code./li liTextEdit is able to save as code*.docx/code. Of course this is only really an option if your formatting is simple./li /ol  <answer44133> ol liOpen the file you want to export in strongPages/strong./li liSelect all; Copy/li liCreate a new, empty file in strongTextEdit/strong and save it with the name you want as a code.docx/code file./li liOpen the file in strongPages/strong/li liPaste your content into the code.docx/code file/li liSave the code.docx/code file/li /ol  (Or create an automator workflow to do all this, if you find yourself doing it often)  <comment50108> It's really strange that Apple would support .docx in TextEdit but not in Pages. This is especially strange because Office'08 already supported that format, while Pages came out one year later. <comment50109> Actually, TextEdit will be fine for most cases as it supports **rich formatting**! :) <comment50153> Is it possible to trigger such an automator workflow from within of pages? That would be awesome! <comment50203> OK, let me try to work that out. I suspect the answer is yes. <comment50210> Both TextEdit and Pages have less than ideal scripting dictionaries. Sadly, this will take some doing. I suspect it can be automated, but it won't happen tonight. <comment50219> I will make sure to attach a bounty if you get it to work in order to honor your efforts :) <comment50336> Just for reference, the scripting project is going badly.I'm not writing it off yet, but without a breakthrough, this isn't going to work. Also, I have Pages '08 on my machine, which can import docx but can't save them, so I can't test this without spending money to upgrade... <comment50340> That's sad, but thank you for your undertaking! <comment169032> I have the same problem, but the answers here seems to be slightly outdated. A reference of the version of the OS to which this question was related would be nice. <comment169033> For example, with `Lion` TextEdit isn't able to save under `.docx`. <comment169231> This answer needs some update. For example, with `Lion` TextEdit isn't able to save under `.docx` format.
