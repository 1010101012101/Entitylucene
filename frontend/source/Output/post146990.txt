rsync doesn't copy some files - failed to open /tmp files <body> I am trying to copy everything from one disk partition to another, so I have used:  precode&gt; time sudo rsync -aE --progress  /Volumes/Files/ /Volumes/xxxx\ archive  /code/pre  The copy takes almost 10 hours for about 557 GB. At the end I see:  precodesent 555851786605 bytes  received 17096882 bytes  15585618.69 bytes/sec total size is 553799473828  speedup is 1.00 rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-42/rsync/main.c(992) [sender=2.6.9] /code/pre  After trying several searches to find the errors in one and a half million lines, I find this:  precodeApple development/ethernal Folder/__MACOSX/ Apple development/ethernal Folder/__MACOSX/Ethernal 1.2/ send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._.DS_Store.QTDkX5": No such file or directory send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._Read-me.rtf.TFnOeF": No such file or directory Apple development/ethernal Folder/__MACOSX/Ethernal 1.2/Source/ send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._.DS_Store.j5YUu5": No such file or directory send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._EthernalIcon.icns.JBXisF": No such file or directory send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._Read-me.rtf.GFp1z0": No such file or directory Apple development/ethernal Folder/__MACOSX/Ethernal 1.2/Source/Doc/ send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._.DS_Store.WbalMH": No such file or directory send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._Ethernet Type Codes.webloc.G2KRaL": No such file or directory send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._Ethernet- IEEE 802.3 Local Area Network (LAN) protocols Overview.webloc.Yerfpk": No such file or directory send_files failed to open "/tmp/.._IP Protocol.

(I am using rsync 2.6.9 on Mac OS X 10.7.5)  There is no problem with permissions, because I ran the copy with 'sudo', and actually I also tried both with and without permissions on the mounted partition. At first I thought it might be interference from a cron job that was cleaning directories while I was running the copy overnight. I tried the copy again:  precode&gt; time sudo rsync -aE --inplace  /Volumes/Files/ /Volumes/xxxx\ archive  /code/pre  and the copy failed on exactly the same 31 files (with or without the '--inplace').  I have tried looking at a couple of the files on the source partition, and although 'more' said they might be binary, it had no difficulty in outputting them to the screen. The destination copy is a bit larger than the source; I don't think this is due to compression in the source, because the files in the source were all written under Mac OS X 10.5.8 or earlier which I think is before compression because available. I think the size difference may be due to spotlight writing to the disk?  The failure is not reported on reading the original file, but on reading a /tmp file, but the default is to stage the copy into the destination, not onto /tmp, so it should not be using /tmp at all.  The failure is completely reproducible, so any ideas what is wrong, or how to diagnose the problem?
