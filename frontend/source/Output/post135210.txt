Interstitial screen/marketing layer on Airport guest wifi <body> Is there a way I can add an interstitial screen when a user first logs in to my Airport Extreme's guest network whereby I can make a marketing ask (like, "Like us on Facebook!") and require them to check a box and click a button ("I accept the terms of service," etc.) before continuing to browse the web?  <answer135213> What you're looking for is a strongCaptive Portal/strong.  You can't create captive portals solely with an AirPort Extremeâ€”you need at least a computer behind the network set up as DCHP/DNS/etc. You're going to need to configure a Mac to provide DNS to redirect the first visit from a device to a hosted site.  For more information about creating a captive portal yourself, see:  ul lihttp://brewstersoft.com/blog/setting-up-a-captive-portal.html/li /ul  Commercial software is available which can set this up for you:  ul lihttp://patronsoft.com/firstspot//li /ul  <answer159740> your looking to do something like what the Wavespot (router) does, its a social wifi authentication gateway that allows people to sign into a wifi network using email or Facebook 'Like' (or twitter or Google Plus). Good service and we use it for a few of our agency (bluntagency.com) clients, predominantly shopping centre's.  <comment160248> know of any good open source alternatives to firstspot? $500+ is quite pricey! <comment160249> @selfagency Nope :( <comment160252> I figured out a way to do it way cheaper. I can get a $30 TP-Link router, then install CoovaAP, which is open source OpenWRT-compatible Captive Portal firmware, then use the TP-Link router as my gateway for guests.
