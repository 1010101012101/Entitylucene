Keynote Animations - Can they be random? <body> I am stumped with a Keynote question (same problem in Powerpoint)â€”  I made a Jeopardy Board. I want people to choose questions randomly. When I click on the question, I have ANIMATED the 100, 200, etc, so the numbers fade away. Then I've hyperlinked to a slide with each question on it.  PROBLEM: Animations have to be set in a particular order! I want the questions to be chosen randomly. Do you know any way around setting up animations so they are not in order?  Any suggestions appreciated!! Thank you!  <answer124050> You may be able to achieve this behaviour using AppleScript.
