importing a book from to iPhotos back into iPhotos <body> I created a book in iphotos. Then i exported it as a pdf file to desktop. I deleted it from iPhotos. I now want to add more pages to the book. Can I take it back to iPhotos and complete the book and how?   <answer216617> No, you can't reimport the PDF. You should still have the photos in your library and you can use the PDF to guide you in recreating the book.
