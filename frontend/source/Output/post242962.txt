Messages Default Replies not updating on Apple Watch <body> I'm trying to update the available Default Replies on my iWatch, for replying to SMS/iMessage messages. Everything I've read tells me to go to the Watch app on the iPhone, go into Messages, go into Default Replies, and change them there.  The listing on the iPhone shows: "Hello!", "What's up", "On my way.", "OK", "Sure!", "No problem!", etc. Those are the defaults - I've tried putting my own text in also.  When I go into messages on the watch, the default replies when replying are: "You're welcome.", "No problem.", "No worries.", "NP", "No prob...", etc.  It looks like an entirely different list. I've dug through all the menus I can find, and can't find the listing that is shown on the watch anywhere. I changed the default replies for Mail - that worked fine. So there's either a listing I'm missing somewhere (and someone can point me to!), or the two devices just aren't in sync for Messages. I did already have to re-pair the watch once to get it to properly stick with an email settings change I made (move discarded messages into Deleted instead of Archive), I'm almost at the point of trying that again, but I'm wary of wrecking anything else that is now configured correctly, and the fact that there might be a default replies list I've missed somewhere, and the re-pairing will do nothing in that case anyway - it confuses me that the two lists are so radically different.
