This computer is no longer authorised for purchased items <body> I am facing a very annoying problem from last few days. Whenever I try to install an app from my Mac to my iPad it says:     This computer is no longer authorised for purchased items   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2hgJ9.png" alt=""  but when I try to authorise this computer, it says:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ylpzn.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CYTWw.png" alt=""     This computer is already authorised   <answer205331> You've probably authorised the computer with a different iTunes account from the one that the iPad is using. Have you tried deauthorising it and then authorising it again? (If you've purchased iPad apps on both the iPad and the Mac, using different iTunes accounts, then you've got a problem.)  <answer224893> I had this same problem. I discovered that at some time in the past I had created another AppleID. My iPhone was "logged" in using one ID, I was trying to sync iTunes using a different ID. Go to Settings iTunes &amp; App Store and note what your AppleID is. Now in iTunes check to see if you are logged in (upper right near the search box) under a different ID. If you are, log out and try storeauthorize using the same ID as your iPhone. I had to de-authorize the computer first because it was registered somehow under the other ID. Then re-authorize using the same ID as my phone. It worked for me.  <comment247595> Sorry but this not work for me <comment247626> In what way does it not work? You can't deauthorise? You can't then reauthorise? You can do both but you still can't transfer apps to your iPad? <comment247704> I can do both, but still can't transfer app to my ipad <comment247707> OK, can you check that the Apple ID you're using when you reauthorise iTunes is the same as the one shown on the iPad under "iTunes & App Store" in Settings. Then it might be worth signing the iPad out of the iTunes Store and back in again -- tap on the Apple ID to do that. <comment247841> I checked... both are same. But nothing happen. <comment310302> Was this ever solved? <comment310381> Actually I had formatted my computer few days back. Now it's working fine. So I don't know what is the actual solution.
