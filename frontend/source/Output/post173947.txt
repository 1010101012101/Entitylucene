How do I get an operating system onto a new hard drive? <body> I will be installing a new 500GB hard drive in my macbook.  It is a late 2008, aluminum, 13-inch screen.  Once I install it, how do I get an operating system that's 10.7 or newer (downloaded from the App Store) on to the bare/unformatted drive?  <answer173950> OSXDaily has a wonderful guide to creating a bootable USB drive for Yosemite, the most recent version of OS X. This will allow you to install the operating system on your new hard drive.  You will need two things:  ul li16GB flash drive/li liA copy of "Install Yosemite", which you can download for free from the Apple App Store/li /ul  This guide will also walk you through the install process as well.  Hope this helps!  <answer173953> I just installed a new 500GB SSD on my MacBook Pro 17" (early 2011) and used Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the contents of my current hard drive to the new one. This works well if you have a working hard drive already in your Mac; and you should clone the drive before installing the new hard drive. You can connect the hard drive externally to your MacBook Pro using an adapter. Cloning is easily done, and testing the install is accomplished by rebooting the Mac and holding down the "Option" key. Select the new hard drive from the list, and you'll know pretty quickly if it was successfully cloned or not.  If you need a clean install of OS X, you'll have to use a bootable USB drive. This tutorial describes how to do so.   <answer174026> Quick and easy: Find and dedust the system DVDs, bring the optical drive back to live by removing the crumbs inside and install Mac OS X 10.5.5 (Leopard).  ;-)  <answer190702> You'll need a USB Recovery drive or install CD.   The good news is, since your old HDD is functioning fine and set up as an external, you can boot from that: Hold down the "Option" key on startup until you see your drive. If you see a "Recovery Partition" here, select that. You may have to re-join your Wi-Fi Network here.   Note: Plugging an Ethernet cable into your Router is strongly recommended here. The Mac OS X downloadable installer is a large file. Click "Install Mac OS X," be sure to select your new internal HDD, and follow the prompts.   If you did not see a Recovery Partition, proceed to the next step.   If you did not see a Recovery Partition, you will need a USB thumb drive of at least 2 GB for an Internet Recovery install, and or 16 GB for direct install. Select your old HDD to continue booting.  From there, you will be able to follow this tutorial on how to create a USB Recovery Drive:   http://osxdaily.com/2014/10/16/make-os-x-yosemite-boot-install-drive/  Install OS X should format automatically, but to be sure you get a good, clean install: Go to Disk Utility, and select the new HDD from the left field. It should be labeled "Untitled". Click the "Erase" tab, and for "Format:" select "Mac OS Extended (Journaled). For "Name:" use anything you like.   Click the "Erase" button, and the disk will be formatted. Exit Disk Utilities, which will bring you back to "Install Mac OS X," or "Reinstall OS X New Copy". Click and follow the prompts. Now all you have to do is wait!  Some notes:  Restore from Time Machine only works if you have a Time Machine set up, Disk First Aid is for repairing an already formatted drive, and Get Help explains the features available.  Remember you can restart into Recovery Mode and run Disk Utilities, as this will save you time in the future if your Mac starts acting erratically.   <answer205063> Being a 1 Mac household and an IT professional who has only supported PCs, I had a challenging time trying to figure out how to reload OSX after my husband's Mac hard drive died. Hopefully I diagnosed a bad hard drive correctly (I'll provide my method) and I hope this helps someone out there. This is probably overkill on instructions, but there are PC people out there who may try to help out the  (much more) rare critical Mac issue. I did most of this from memory, so I may have messed up a label here or there. Please use Common sense if I did this and look around the screen for something that looks like what I'm talking about.  strongNOTE/strong: This process only worked because the hard drive was still able to access recovery mode by holding Command+R on startup. If your Mac is unable to access that feature, this may not work for you, but I included some other handy stuff, like recovering files from the drive.  Initial Symptom: My husband's Mac had been randomly shutting down for some time, but we were limping it along. Finally, on startup one day, he saw a progress bar that would complete and then the device would shut down. Here is the process I followed:  strongThings you'll need:/strong  ul liSATA/IDE to USB Adapter (Mine was Vantec USB 2.0, but it shouldn't matter. Be sure to get one with external power source.

This was the most frustrating part to research. When you Google, " How do I load OSX on a new hard drive using a PC ", you end up with some great suggestions to use VM Virtual Box, which means you have to get a copy of your OSX load. Well, mine happened to be on this one very broken Mac hard drive, and you can only make a Mac bootable with a Mac. Grr...So, I gave this a shot. I hope it works for you.  ol liInstall the strongNEW/strong hard drive back into Mac. Before you do this, there are a couple of screw-in pins that are in the sides of the old hard drive that you will need to hold your new hard drive in place. Use the T8 mini Torx screwdriver to remove them and place them into the sides of the new drive. These will hold your new drive in place. Put a couple of screws on opposite corners of the bottom plate to hold it in place and protect all the precious bits in there. strongDo not turn on the Mac yet/strong/li liConnect the strongOLD/strong device to the SATA/IDE connector, connect the USB to the Mac and turn on the power to the new hard drive/li liHold down the emOption/em key and turn on the device to choose which device to boot to./li liSelect the strongOLD/strong hard drive (Probably called Recovery_[something]) when prompted to choose a boot device./li liThe boot sequence will take you into the Mac Recovery Utilities menu/li liSelect the Disk Utilities option from the menu/li liSelect the strongNEW/strong Drive in the list to the left and click emVerify Disk/em.

First format your stick or other device to windows fat, then erase it again but set it to the mac journaled and wow...you got the drop down menu. Just setting it to the journaled will not give you all the menu bars...only the top two. Download the app from the app store for the install, but do not hit continue or you will install and it will disappear so you cannot copy it. Hold down option key, drag it into your stick or what ever, wait for the 22 minutes and you got it. Make another copy from that copy on your desk top or another drive and be sure not to lose it.  Took me three freeeeekin days to figure it out. I spoke to a ton of wiz kids, adults and IT people and not one got it correct for me. But man oh man, they really are smart...especially kids. So it feels great to give something back when I felt so lame all these years.

Really impressed by this.  <answer266033> My MacBook late 2009 didn't start properly and it turned out that the old hard drive had some I/O errors. I bought a new Kingston SSD hard drive, then switched it with the old Toshiba. I then plugged the old Toshiba to the computer using a USB interface cable and started the computer in Recovery mode (Command+R pressed while powering on). Using the utilities I erased the new hard drive using the default options and made a new OSX install using my WiFi. After the OSX was installed it automatically suggested to import applications, settings etc from the old hard drive still connected via USB. Everything now works like a charm. No timemachine or cloning needed. I'm using the latest OSX version available for the late 2009 MacBook. Hope this helps!  <comment204768> This will not work for the Mac mentioned.

Migration Assistant is located under _Applications : Utilities : Migration Assistant_. <comment226463> Does the new HD count as a 'new computer'?
