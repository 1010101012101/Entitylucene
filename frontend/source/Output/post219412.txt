Changing security questions <body> i have 15$ in my iTunes account and whenever I try to buy something, it says I have to answer security questions, but I do not remember any of them. So when I try to reset my security questions, it sends to an email address that I don't even use. I'm wondering how to change that address that Apple sends it to, to reset my security questions. I know it's hard to understand my question but I really need to find a solution to this.  <comment265365> Start at https://iforgot.apple com If that doesn't help, you'll have to call Apple. No-one else can help. <comment265454> Actually it sounds like the password is known, so [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com/) is what you want.
