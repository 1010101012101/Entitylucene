"More Info" always "Fetching..." when I "Get Info" from a file <body> I'm having this issue with the "strongMore Info/strong" section of the strongInfo window/strong of a file (Cmd + I or "Get Info" in contextual menu):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4lxWi.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm running Sierra 10.12.3, and I'm not sure when this started to happen, but it happens with all kind of files.  Any idea on how can I track the root problem?  Thanks!  <answer274026> The problem was that I had strongSpotlight/strong disabled. I disabled it because performance. I really never use it.  Would be great if Finder could get that metadata on the fly if it can't find them indexed.  To active Spotlight again:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  <comment344264> Launch Services is at fault here. Rebuild or reset Launch Services using the technique [mentioned at this link](http://wccftech.com/fix-fetching-issue-mac-os-open-with-context-menu/). It worked for me a few weeks ago. <comment344273> @IconDaemon I ran the command, but the issue is still present. <comment344274> Did you restart the computer? <comment344278> Yes, I just restarted my laptop. But it doesn't help :( <comment344446> @IconDaemon finally the problem was that I had Spotlight disabled, thanks for your help. <comment344460> MDS is a low-level service used by much more than just Spotlight. It's a general indexing service for the file system and [any app can launch metadata queries](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsmetadataquery), including Finder and Spotlight.
