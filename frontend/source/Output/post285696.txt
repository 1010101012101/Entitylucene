Create Google sheets shortcut in homescreen <body> How do you do this please?  This quora answer instructs on how to create a shortcut to a sheet in safari, but how about creating a shortcut to a sheet in the sheets app?  <comment360382> What happens if you use Sheets in Safari and add a homescreen icon from there? <comment360582> @patrix It asks the user to sign in to the user's google account. I guess you were expecting that from safari, the user would then be redirected to the sheets app? Good question actually. Thanks patrix <comment360588> Ah, you want to create a shortcut *into* a specific sheet *inside* the Sheet app? LaunchCenterPro might be an option, but I don't know whether the Sheet app itself supports this (would require a matching URL scheme) <comment360599> @patrix Man that's a hassle but thanks for commenting. Are Apple/iPhone users really unable to work well with Google Sheets then? <comment360600> "work well" probably depends on the user :-) <comment360601> And the ability itself depends on Google who needs to provide a way to tell the Sheet app to open a specific sheet directly
