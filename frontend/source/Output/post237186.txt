What are some good ways to close an app without using your mouse/trackpad? <body> I have an app that would fail once in a while, and I need to restart it if it doesn't works as expected.  I can use Spotlight to start it after closing it. But how do I close it quickly using something as efficient as Spotlight?  <answer237188> If the application is active You can press kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbdQ/kbd to quit the app. If You want to force quit this app - press  kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbd⎋ Esc/kbd.  If the app is currently not active hold down kbd⌘ CMD/kbd and navigate to Your app with kbd⇥ TAB/kbd, then without releasing the kbd⌘ CMD/kbd press kbdQ/kbd.  <comment290397> Force quit is Cmd Option Esc.
