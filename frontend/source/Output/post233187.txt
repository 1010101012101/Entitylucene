Should I be worried after clicking on attachment in scam email? <body> I received the email in the screenshot, which I'm fairly sure is a scam. I clicked on the attachment in the Mail app on my iPhone 6 (iOS 9.2). Note that I didn't unzip the attachment. Should I be concerned that clicking on the attachment will be harmful?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lp6gq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer233351> You should be safe on your iPhone, normally these scam mails hope to be open on PCs where they can run scripts. your iPhone will not open the zip automatically, you would have to use a third party app.  You should be fine.  <comment285020> I don't think the iPhone can open zip files. If not, then you are safe. <comment285212> Could you elaborate on the harm you feel you are exposed to? Loss of privacy? Concern that an email is marked as valid? Remote code execution? Change settings?
