Is the App or the iPhone causing the issue? <body> So about a month ago I started using the Nike+ GPS app and everything was working fine until a few days ago while using it, my ipod starts skipping and the voice control automatically pops up. At first I thought the app had glitches but then even after i close the app, my ipod was still skipping and that voice control thing popped up. So should I restore? Is there a problem with my phone itself? Or is the app the one that caused this issue?   Thanks in advance for your input.   <answer137279> I don't think it's the app that's causing the issue. And I believe there are two separate issues with separate causes.   First, the skipping issue could be caused by a corrupt iPhone music DB - this is fixable by re-syncing the iPhone with iTunes.   Second, voice control could kick in automatically if you use some kind of accessory such as headphones. Try not using this accessory for a while and see whether the voice-control issue is sorted.  <comment25818> Is your home button stuck? Or the button on your headphones? <comment25819> Delete the app, run for a day or two and let us know the answer! <comment32664> Hmm, you know, I think my home button is the issue now that you ask me. Because sometimes i tap it and it doesn't respond right away.
