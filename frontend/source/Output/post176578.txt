Using 45W Power Adapter with MacBook Pro Retina 15 <body> I would like to know if I am able to use a 45W MagSafe Power Adapter in my MacBook Pro Retina 15 with a MagSafe to MagSafe 2 Adapter.  I am normally using the original one (85W MagSafe 2 Power Adapter) but I just want to know that the computer will charge correctly and that the battery won't be hurt.  <answer176584> It will charge. However, it will do so very slowly.  <answer176998> I've been using the MacBook Air 45W power adapter with my MacBook Pro Retina 15" and it works perfectly. Charging takes a little longer than with the original power adapter. I recommend the 45W adapter for travel.  <comment208562> agree - it may, in fact, not keep up if the machine is in heavy use. <comment208621> only good for overnight use <comment209220> The other thing to bear in mind will be heat - I've used the charger for my 13 inch MacBook with my 15 MPB - it works, but gets very warm. I suspect this will decrease the life of the charger as well.
