Mail and Messages shows up, but no AirDrop.  How can I AirDrop my Notes from mac to iDevice?  <answer283654> It appears that you cannot share notes via Airdrop from a Mac.  I have checked four Macs (all running either El Capitan or Sierra) and in each case I find the exact same situation as you. More specifically, trying to share a note does strongnot/strong give me the option of using Airdrop strongand/strong if I click on the emMore.../em option I also see AirDrop listed with a ticked checkmark (greyed out just like in your screenshot).  This is not something I had noticed previously as I haven't tried to share a Note from any of my Macs.  Now, I also checked whether this is a known issue and found this discussion on Apple's website. Although it was started in January 2015, you'll see that the most recent post was (at the time of writing this) just over a week ago.  I'm not entirely sure why sharing notes via AirDrop from a Mac isn't an option (although the fact that notes are all stored emwithin/em the Notes app and can be synced via iCloud may be part of the reason).  I suggest you send feedback to Apple.  If you do need a way to share your notes via Airdrop, then there's a few workarounds online (including within the above-mentioned discussion). The one I like most is to do as follows:  ol liWithin the Notes app, open the note you want to share/li liGo to File  Export as PDF.../li liClick Save/li liWithin Finder, navigate to the exported PDF/li liRight-click on the file /li liSelect Share  AirDrop/li /ol  <answer283805> notes are synced across all you I-devices. So I'm confused why you'd need airdrop. Something saved to Notes on a Mac appears in Notes on iPhone or iPad. So you have direct access to it.  <comment357874> I'm wondering if it's because Notes are now synced across all devices with the same Apple ID? <comment357957> I'm not using iCloud to store my notes, as I mentioned in the question the notes are stored **on my mac**. <comment357961> Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too. Regardless, it's not consistent behaviour and is actually bad UX design. After all, if we can share a note to _other_ users via Messages, etc, then why not via AirDrop? Just seems odd.
