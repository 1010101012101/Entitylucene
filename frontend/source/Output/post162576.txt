Horizontal lines visible on retina monitor <body> I have a retina monitor, but I can see horizonal "pixel" lines on my screen. This occurred soon after I installed Yosemite, then the problem disappeared, now it has reappeared again. Restarting the computer or restarting in safe mode does nothing. How can I fix this issue?  My system details are as follows:  OS X Yosemite, Version 10.10.1 MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) Graphics: Intel Iris Pro 1526 MB  Color LCD:   Display Type: Retina LCD   Resolution: 2880 x 1800 Retina   Retina: Yes   Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)   Main Display: Yes   Mirror: Off   Online: Yes   Built-In: Yes  <comment190185> If you open System Prefs  Displays  Display & switch to 'Scaled' what resolution does it say is active?
