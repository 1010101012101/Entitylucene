Approve this iPhone 7 getting stuck on approve iPhone screen <body> I have the iPhone 7 and I'm running a Macbook Pro OS fully upgraded. I go through the approve new iPhone process, approve the keychain on my mac, and then the phone just gets stuck on the approval process. The wheel just runs and runs but never finishes approving.
