Mac OS X Lion boots very slowly takes 2 minutes to start <body> Leopard was good used to start in second but Lion is taking too much time to start it takes 2-3 minutes to start.  Is it problem with my MBP or anyone experience this before? Please guide help.  <answer41579> Try a...  h2PRAM Reset/h2  ol liShut down the computer./li liPress and hold the kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd keys. You must press this key combination before the gray screen appears./li liHold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time./li liRelease the keys./li /ol  Why could this help? - Information stored in PRAM includes the emstartup volume choice/em.   <answer41592> Make sure that the correct startup disk is selected in System Preferences under "Startup Disk". Sometimes your mac might forget which drive it needs to boot from, which may cause it to spend extra time searching for a boot drive at start up.  h2Change your startup disk: Make sure your Lion volume is selected/h2  ol liGo to emApple menu  System Preferences/em, and then click Startup Disk./li liUnlock the Startup Disk preferences: If necessary, click the lock icon and type the name and password for an administrator./li liClick the icon of the disk where Lion is installed and restart./li /ol  <answer41622> Looks Like this is a common problem for a few users as referenced here Lion slow to boot?  It might be caused as a result of upgrading from older versions of Mac OS X to Lion. Their fix was to perform a "clean install of Lion"  <comment47151> What kind of MacBook Pro do you have? What hard drive are you running? If you have a the first gen 2006 Core Duo MacBook Pro with a slower 5400RPM drive that might be a normal boot time. <comment47160> This is not really the information we need. Can you post a kernel.log on pastebin and link it here? <comment47213> Performing an SMC reset for a slow booting mac is probably not the best first choice. According to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964 slow booting is not a common symptom that would require performing a SMC reset? <comment47214> @MrDaniel Yes. Probably only resetting the PRAM will help here. I added the SMC reset, because I usually reset both at once when I troubleshoot. <comment47244> It's very unlikely that the EFI takes that long to check for bootable disks. If it really takes ages, it's most likely caused by broken storage devices. And if it's this kind of problem, manually selecting the startup disk won't change anything. EFI will still try to enumerate them. <comment47248> After a PRAM reset, you should be sure to reselect the startup disk (see @MrDaniel's answer), since that's one of the things stored in the PRAM. <comment47249> @GordonDavisson I've never done that before. I guess this does not matter for single-boot? <comment47291> @gentmatt it's not really necessary, but it will actually speed the boot process (slightly) because the firmware doesn't have to think as much about what to boot from.
