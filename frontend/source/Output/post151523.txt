How many displays/monitors can a Mac Mini 2012 support? <body> I know the 2012 mini has 2 video outputs but I've seen in the past PCs where one DVI output could be split to two displays.  So is the limit one monitor per physical display port (HDMI &amp; whichever proprietary socket Apple were using that month) or something else?  <answer151526> From Everymac... http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i7-2.3-late-2012-specs.html  2nd Display Support:    Dual/Mirroring* 2nd Max. Resolution:    2560x1600*  *This model simultaneously supports 1920x1200 on an HDMI or a DVI display (using the included HDMI-to-DVI adapter) and 2560x1600 on a Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort display or even a VGA display (with an optional Mini DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter, which is compatible with the Thunderbolt port).  <comment178310> This link show you can also have dual thunderbolt monitors so the complete list of options isn't clear... <comment178318> where? quote it. <comment178324> Sorry forgot to paste http://osxdaily.com/2014/01/25/mac-setups-mac-mini-dual-thunderbolt-displays/ <comment178327> I'd relate that back to Everymac - they are very fastidious about maintaining an accurate database <comment178329> ... though I am tempted to say that's someone who spent a fortune on his desk, chair & monitors, then skimped on the important component... the compy ;-)
