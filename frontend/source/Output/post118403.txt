Why XCode needs to be stopped to update iTunes ? <body> I'm wondering everytime iTunes has an update :   Why XCode needs to be stopped to update iTunes ?   Is it some kind of shared component ?   <answer118410> Both depend upon the same PrivateFramework.  Specifically codeusbmuxd/code is part of the MobileDevice.framework which communicates to iOS devices. When an iTunes update includes an update to codeusbmuxd/code, then Xcode can be flagged to prevent it from interacting with the subsystem while the update is being performed.  <comment138178> Does http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99472/is-it-possible-to-update-the-itunes-without-updating-xcode?rq=1 help? <comment138179> It's a good start but lacks references imho.
