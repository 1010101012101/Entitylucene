Missing older iTunes purchased music on new MacBook <body> I just bought a new MacBook Air and signed into my iTunes account to get my music, but only my most recently purchased songs showed up, and a couple of other random songs.  I tried looking at my previous purchased music not on this device, to see if I could re-download it, but they wouldn't show up. But when I looked up one of the missing albums, it said "purchased" but gave me no little cloud icon to download it.   Please help.   <comment308999> Could you have bought it with another Apple ID? <comment309129> No I bought it with the same Apple ID I signed in with, and I searched for it all on my Mac that I just bought.
