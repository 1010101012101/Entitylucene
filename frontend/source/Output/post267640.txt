Can't update apps. When I try to it tells me to switch to the UK store but once doing that it tells me to switch back to the French Store <body> The full message is:  "Account Not In This Store. Your account is not valid for use in the French store. You must switch to the UK store before purchasing"   After doing so it sends this:  "Account Not In This Store. Your account is not valid for use in the UK store. You must switch to the French store before purchasing"   Some apps that display this include: Google Maps, Plex, Skype, Wunderlist, Mi Fit, Google Translate, Facebook...   This started to happen once I switched from iPhone 6 to iPhone 7 Plus. Would that have something to do with this?
