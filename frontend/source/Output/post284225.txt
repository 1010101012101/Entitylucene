LG Ultrafine 4K display - USB hub turns off when screen turns off / unplugged from MacBook <body> I have my MacBook plugged into an LG Ultrafine 4K display (as recommended, sold and partially engineered by Apple).  When I unplug my Mac from it the USB hub stops charging devices attached to it. This is ridiculous as I mainly use it as a charging hub.  Is there any way to keep the USB hub powered all the time?  There is nothing in the manual about this - and I can find nothing on Google.  thx.  <comment358439> When you say _or the screen goes off _ do you mean it's gone to sleep, is on standby, or that it's powered off? <comment358559> I've rephrased the question - it doesn't matter. When I unplug my monitor from my computer it stops charging USB devices. I want to keep charging those devices.
