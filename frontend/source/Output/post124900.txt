Is it possible to create shortcuts for VLC using Automator? <body> I see here that Automator can be used to create commands that then can be triggered globally.  I have no idea how to use Automator but see that it has some options for involving applications... Can a "service" be created for VLC that will then be bound to keystroke triggers?  What I want are simple commands like pause/play, back and forward that could be used with shortcuts no matter what other window application is on top.  <answer124930> You can create services like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjms8.png" alt=""  Then give the services shortcuts from System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services.  I prefer using third party applications instead of services to assign shortcuts to scripts though. There has been a bug since 10.7 where the shortcuts for services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar (or for example run a service once from the menu bar). There is also a noticeable delay before services are run, and the shortcuts for services don't work when an application that doesn't have a services menu (like Tower) is frontmost.  More examples:  precodetell application "VLC"     if playing then         tell application "System Events" to tell process "VLC"             click menu item "Pause" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Playback" of menu bar 1         end tell     else         play     end if end tell /code/pre    precodetell application "VLC"     set n to 60     if duration of current item - current time &gt; n then         set current time to current time + n     else         next     end if end tell /code/pre    precodetell application "VLC"     set fullscreen mode to not fullscreen mode end tell /code/pre    precodetell application "VLC"     volumeUp end tell /code/pre  Open VLC's dictionary in AppleScript Editor to see all supported terminology.  <comment146177> Just out of interest what Mac do you have. <comment146178> @Buscar웃 - macbook air and mavericks <comment146179> My MBA has the media keys for that function, do they not work for you? <comment146180> @Buscar웃 - there are three on my keyboard, next, previous and play/pause. i am interested in a larger range of shortcuts that would work in the same way, especially in back/forward (within the same file). vlc has three levels of jump back-forward, iTunes only one. I use this for transcription so it is a big difference to me <comment146202> If you press the back-forward keys, it's go back/forward in the same file...
