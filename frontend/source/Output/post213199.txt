How do I refresh the graph in the iOS 9 Stocks app? <body> In the Stock app, when I click on a ticker and select "1W" to specify one week's worth of stock data on the graph, it pulls the data and displays the graph.  If I go back many hours later, the graph shows the emcached/em version of the graph.  Is there a way to get the app to update the graph?  The only way I know is to close the app and re-open it.  <answer213226> It seams like the only option is closing the app via multitasking and reopening it again.  A "swipe down to refresh" function could be useful to have in this case.  <comment257421> confirmed, I see the same thing. restarting the app seems to be the only way
