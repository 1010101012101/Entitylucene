Image capture "import error (-50)" images import fine, but won't delete from phone? <body> My iPhone 5 recently broke, so I got an iPhone 5s. I restored from a backup using iTunes, and configured any remaining settings fine.   Usually to take images from my phone's camera I plug the phone into the computer and use Image Capture, then drag the images from Image Capture to the file I want. I have the "delete after import" setting selected so that the images are removed from my phone after import to save space.  Now when I try this with the new phone it works fine on importing the photos, but I get an error (see attached screenshot) and the images don't auto delete from my phone.   Any ideas how I can resolve this?   hr  strongUPDATE - Laptop &amp; Phone Spec/strong  My computer - Mid 2012 MBP 15" running osx 10.9.5  My iPhone - 5s running iOS 8.3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/trYyn.png" alt="screenshot of image capture"  <answer201924> I've noticed this is now solved on my iPhone. I'm not 100% sure how I did it but the 2 notable things I did very recently were:  ol lirename the iPhone from "iphone(3)" to "Sam's iPhone"/li liturned off iCloud on the iPhone then turned in back on/li /ol  Not sure which one solved it; would be good if any one who has this issue does the same and report back to be able to clarify.  <answer272292> restart computer. it may too much applications running in the same time.  <comment226630> Not the same issue but may be related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/971/38539 <comment230062> Which are the versions of OS X and iOS we are talking about? <comment230079> @juandesant good point, its OSX 10.9.5 and IOS 8.3, ive updated this in the question also <comment342266> Welcome to Ask Different.

I never renamed the iPhone so I'd say it's probably iCloud.
