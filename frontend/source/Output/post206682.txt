how to add a ssh directory in finder? <body> I have a linux computer and I can access to it trough the terminal with the command: codessh account_name@123.117.140.61/code   Now I am trying to access to the folders in that computer trough finder using the connect to server option.  I receive the following error codeThere was a problem connecting to the server/code.     How can I solve?  <comment249158> What protocol are you trying to use when using “Connect to server”? <comment249197> I do not have any options choose. I can only write the address  `smb://account_name@123.117.140.61/` I did not even find a place to insert the password. <comment249279> What do you intend to use? smb or ssh? <comment249439> `ssh` . I have tried also `ftps://account@ip/` but it does not work either.
