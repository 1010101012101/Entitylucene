Always prompt for Boot Device on Startup? <body> I have a MacBook where I have to dual boot Windows and OS X. When I hold the Option Key on startup, I get the nice "Select Boot Device" screen.  Is there a way to permanently enable this, so that I don't have to remember to hold option every time I restart?  <answer8782> One way to do this is to install a boot loader such as rEFIt.  This will present you with a menu similar to the following when you start up your computer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXw0S.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment9398> That seemed like a mighty large stone to kill a very small bird, but it works fine :)
