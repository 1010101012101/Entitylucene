How do I merge the tabs of two safari windows when I have more than two open? <body> So far, I know how I can merge emall/em windows with all their tabs using:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDCTU.png" alt="enter image description here"  I use different windows in safari to organize them by content. Sometimes it makes sense to merge the tabs of two windows. This very easy when you have only two Safari windows open.  How can I do this when I have more than two windows? I'm open to solutions using extensions.  <answer37988> You can drag tabs between windows in safari (I beleive this was added in Safari 4 along with a few other improvements)  <answer180714> First, if the tab bar isn't showing (it usually doesn't show unless there are multiple tabs in the window), select the 1st window you want to merge, then at the menu bar at the top of the screen click View-Show Tab Bar. Next drag the now visible tab bar to the window you want to merge with.   <comment43008> You can drag tabs between windows, what happens if you drag the whole window onto another? <comment43032> @StuWilson: That doesn't do anything. gentmatt: There's always individually dragging each tab over, but as far as I know of, there are no native or third-party ways to merge entire windows selectively. <comment43041> @StuWilson I really did not know that dragging of individual tabs works! How come I did not try this? :) Make that an answer so I can accept it. <comment345703> You have to have two or more tabs in the second window, first. <comment347151> This is the correct procedure if one of the windows has no tabs.
