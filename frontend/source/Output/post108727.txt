Can the Macbook's webcam be ON without LED indication? <body> Was reading some topics online about hackers accessing user's webcams (on Windows) to spy on them etc, and I am now interested to know if I'm at any risk.   To make it simple, these are my questions :  ul liCan Safari allow websites to activate the webcam without my permission ?  /li liCan the webcam be activated without the LED being lit ? /li liAre there any known trojans that affect macs and leave them vulnerable for such hacks ?/li /ul  Thanks  <answer110946> Any software that so chooses may ask you to initiate a FaceTime session. It cannot start one without your say-so.  The FaceTime cameras (like yours) cannot be active without the LCD on.   There aren't really any hacks that matter.   There are a number of really lame, goofy hacks in some web plugins (Flash), that could be used to access a Flash player that displays your camera's stream, for example, but you'd have to have the camera on, or accept a FaceTime session, or whatever.   <answer114361> This research paper reported by the Washington Post and Ars Technica says yes.   Though it was only tested on "old" Macs (Late PPC, early Intel)   <answer114368>    Can Safari allow websites to activate the webcam without my permission   ?   Don't worry about Safari enabling your webcam. The browser would have to use something like flash/plugin to request access.  You would be more susceptible to rogue installed apps for accessing the webcam.  I believe Apple's own find my device can take photos of the user (if it is stolen). I recall seeing news about people taking photos of their thieves and reporting it to police.  <comment127392> I don't think that this would be possible. [Here](http://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/141508/Is+the+iSight+indicator+LED+hardwired+or+can+it+be+circumvented) is also a very recent question similiar to yours from the ifixit.com forums. Regarding your questions: I tend to say no to them all. <comment127393> I was going to post the same link on iFixit that has several good answers. <comment129795> Excellent question Ã— 3 ! <comment131305> This is the corporate political answer, isn't it? Or am I totally wrong and this is the result of an analysis of the set of library interfaces to turn the camera on and to turn the green LED on? Please clarify.
