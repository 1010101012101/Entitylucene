Show USB power use <body> I wanted to see how much power the Anker Astro external battery draws when charging from the MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) (right hand port next to the SD slot), but when listing the USB info in System Profiler, the battery doesn't show up as a device, it does receive some power though, but I thought to get more than the standard 500mA they would have to register and activate high-power mode (which I expected the battery to do).  Additionally it lists the SD card reader as requiring 896mA, but there's no card plugged in, seems odd that the empty reader would need that much power.  So I don't quite trust the output here, is there another way to list devices / get info from the hubs about how much power they are distributing?  precode$ system_profiler SPUSBDataType USB:      USB 3.0 SuperSpeed Bus:        Host Controller Location: Built-in USB       Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBXHCI       PCI Device ID: 0x8c31       PCI Revision ID: 0x0005       PCI Vendor ID: 0x8086       Bus Number: 0x0a          Internal Memory Card Reader:            Product ID: 0x8406           Vendor ID: 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.)

If a device connected requests more it will be exceptionally given more, up to 1 Amp. (ie Card reader made that request).  If you device is not "identified", and did not make the request, it will get the 500mA.  Here is more information from Apple https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204377  If you must know the real time current flow you would need one of the devices that do that Example: http://www.amazon.com/DROK-Extension-Multimeter-Connectors-Consumption/dp/B00S2IA3DG/ref=pd_sim_sbs_pc_7?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=179R1GBKK80252K5HW5V  or this one http://www.amazon.com/AboveTEK%C2%AE-USB-Voltage-Current-Multimeter/dp/B00ICR1UB6/ref=pd_sim_sbs_pc_3/175-5520415-2589050?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=179R1GBKK80252K5HW5V  <comment218871> As for the Card Reader, it only shows how much would it need when in action, that is not the currently used current. <comment218878> http://stackoverflow.com/q/4602828 <comment219008> ok, I was hoping the hubs would offer some info about how much power they give to unidentified devices or something, but I'm not curious enough to buy a multimeter adaptor for that purpose (the battery loaded in a reasonable timeâ€¦)
