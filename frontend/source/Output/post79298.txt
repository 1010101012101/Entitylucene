iPod Touch Not Showing Under Devices in Finder <body> I'm a software developer that recently switched to a Mac. I am using OS X 10.8.2. I am trying to debug an issue with a website using an iPod touch. I've been told that I can connect the iPod to my Mac mini via USB and use the Safari development tools to debug on the iPod. However, I haven't even gotten this far, as when I connect my iPod it does not show under devices in Finder. Could anyone tell me what I am doing incorrectly?  <answer79305> Have you installed Xcode? The best method for viewing error logs, etc....  iPod touches will not show up in Finder as their files are not visible.    <answer79320> The iPod won't appear under Devices in the Finder, so you're not doing anything wrong.  ol liIn Safari on the Mac, first enable the Develop menu by going to Safari  Preferences  Advanced  Show Develop menu in menu bar/li liPlug the iPod in over USB and launch Safari (on the iPod)/li liBack on the Mac, go to Safari's Develop menu and you'll have a new menu item for your iPod touch, which lists all of its open Safari tabs in a submenu/li liSelect a tab from that submenu and Safari's Web Inspector will open. You can now debug the page on the iPod touch through the Web Inspector on the Mac/li /ol  <comment92763> CajunLuke, why do you keep editing my answers?
