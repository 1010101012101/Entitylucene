mac mail (gmail account) crashing on sierra <body> I just upgraded to Sierra (from Yosemite) and now Mail quits at fairly erratic points though mainly when I try to go into the 'sent' folder of my gmail account. It does not crash when i use an 'exchange' account though that sent folder is much smaller. Any tips - and does size of the gmail account matter (!) - its pretty big in terms of the number of messages.  many thanks
