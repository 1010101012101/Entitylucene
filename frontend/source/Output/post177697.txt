How to install tofrodos in Yosemite via Homebrew? <body> This thread is based on my attempt to parse windows syntax to unix in this thread. I run successfully codebrew reinstall tofrodos/code and get  precode==&gt; Reinstalling tofrodos ==&gt; Downloading http://tofrodos.sourceforge.net/download/tofrodos-1.7.13.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/tofrodos-1.7.13.tar.gz ==&gt; make   /usr/local/Cellar/tofrodos/1.7.13: 5 files, 80K, built in 2 seconds /code/pre  I run codehash -r; tofrodos --help/code and get  precode-bash: tofrodos: command not found /code/pre  Also no manual existing: codeman tofrodos/code gives  precodeNo manual entry for tofrodos /code/pre  strongHow can you use this tofrodos command?/strong  <answer177705> The codetofrodos/code package doesn't have a codetofrodos/code command line tool. It provides two command line tools: codefromdos/code and codetodos/code. You can see them in the package directory after Homebrew installs the package locally:  precodeIanCsiMac:~ |ruby-2.1.2| &gt; ls /usr/local/Cellar/tofrodos/1.7.13 COPYING              INSTALL_RECEIPT.json bin                  readme.txt           share  IanCsiMac:~ |ruby-2.1.2| &gt; ls /usr/local/Cellar/tofrodos/1.7.13/bin fromdos todos  IanCsiMac:~ |ruby-2.1.2| &gt; which fromdos /usr/local/bin/fromdos  IanCsiMac:~ |ruby-2.1.2| &gt; which todos /usr/local/bin/todos /code/pre  You need to look for codefromdos/code and codetodos/code in your codePATH/code, not codetofrodos/code -- there is no codetofrodos/code command. Similarly, the codeman/code pages are for those commands, not codetofrodos/code.  <comment210387> Thank you for your answer! I think it is a bad practice to put two unrelated commands in one package like this. Next time I just do *brew info [command]; ls [some-path]/readme" and look for -exe or different executable files which are assumed to be commandline commands. <comment210497> The commands *are* related -- they use a shared library to do OS line ending translation on files. It's very common to package multiple, related commands in to a package like this -- has been as long as I've been a *nix user now...some 25 years now. But really, if you have a problem with what tofrodos contains, you're welcome to submit a patch that breaks the package up: http://www.thefreecountry.com/tofrodos/
