Can I resume an interrupted download of Mac OS X Mountain Lion? <body> I have a slow internet connection. I want to download Mountain Lion (Mac OS X 10.8) from the Mac App Store and resume the download if it gets interrupted because of my internet connection.  Does the Mac App Store allow resuming broken downloads?  <answer57364> Yes - the App store handles interrupted purchases without intervention in most cases. There is a support article if you want to nudge things or it manages to wedge itself.  You don't have to let the download complete on iOS or Mac OS X and can control things on the Mac side of the store much better than on iOS.  <answer95966> The Mac App Store does allow to resume a download, however things do not seem to work out always as expected - to be safe download it all in one piece.  Yesterday, I downloaded Mountain Lion from the Mac App Store - halted it - and resumed later without having restarted the Mac. strongThe whole download started over./strong This is not the first time I have encountered it - therefore I do not take the pause/resume feature for granted.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqFzx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nib80.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment65882> I've also noticed that when you switch from wifi to ethernet, the Mac App Store automatically continues to download via ethernet. <comment65884> So i can download with Resume. Thanks. <comment65954> As well, you can click on the app icon that's downloading in Launch Center to pause it. <comment66134> i've tried it and it completed about 25% downloads then i puased. when i've resumed it started from beginning! crap!
