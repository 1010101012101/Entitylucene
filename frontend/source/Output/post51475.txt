AdobePDFViewerNPAPI shows up in Mission Control <body> When I open a PDF document in Safari and then go into Mission control, I see a window with  different kinds of artifacts (e.g. horizontal black lines on a white background) and it's titled strongAdobePDFViewerNPAPI (Safari internet plug-in)/strong. This window is probably related to the Adobe Reader plug-in that Safari uses. Is there any way to have this window not show up in Mission Control?  <answer51550> The easiest way is to just use a different PDF plugin for Safari. There are instructions on how to do that here.  <answer60101> deleting the plugins from the library worked for me:  http://forums.macworld.com/index.php?/topic/146648-hide-adobepdfviewernpapi-in-mission-control-how/  <comment76956> Welcome to Ask Different!
