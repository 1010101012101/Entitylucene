How can I resolve a permission error when installing gnuplot from homebrew? <body> I am trying to install gnuplot on my mac. after trying    codebrew install gnuplot/code, I get the following errors:         You must 'brew link lua jpeg' before gnuplot can be installed   And when I try    codebrew link lua jpeg/code I get the following error:         Could not symlink file: /usr/local/Cellar/lua/5.1.4/include/lualib.h   /usr/local/include is not writable. You should change its permissions.     Any suggestion? BTW, my XCode and brew are updated.   <answer95464> precodesudo chown $(whoami) /usr/local/include chmod +w /usr/local/include brew link lua /code/pre  <comment82468> Let's see if someone knows an answer offhand, but if you would edit this to add the version of Xcode and OS X it works much better - current versions are very localized but questions about a specific combination can be very useful even a year or two down the road. <comment105458> Sounds like /usr/local wasn't set up with the user you're using to install Homebrew with. What user are you running `brew` as, and what's the output of `ls -ld /usr/local /usr/local/include`?
