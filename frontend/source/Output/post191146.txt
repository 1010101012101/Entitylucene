Missing Messages Preferences (Yosemite) <body> I have a new Macbook Pro (late-2013) with Yosemite. I am missing many Messages preferences, including the ability to set status. There are no options to set to away after a certain amount of time. There is nothing to click on in the lower-left of the messages window. I am just trying to follow Apple's instructions for setting status.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1R0F7.png" alt="enter image description here"
