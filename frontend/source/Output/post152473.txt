How to resolve dropping wifi issue since Yosemite upgrade? <body> As of today I experience random wifi connection drops on my MacBook Air 2012 that force me to reselect the network every ten minutes. The only recent change to the system was an upgrade to Yosemite. A google search indicated that others have the problem as well, yet as of yet I could not find a solution.  How to fix this issue?  <answer156217> Unfortunately I think only Apple can fix this, hopefully with an update to Yosemite (which is reportedly already being tested, but a release date is unknown).  Until then, all I can offer is a workaround.  h2Find Your WiFi "port"/h2  First you need to find your Wi-Fi port. On a MacBook Air this is probably en0.  On a Mac with built-in Ethernet and Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi is emprobably/em codeen1/code.  If you aren't sure, you can use this:  precodeWIFI=`/usr/sbin/networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder |\ egrep Device |\ fgrep Wi-Fi |\ sed 's#.*(Hardware Port: Wi-Fi, Device: ##g ; s#)##g'` /code/pre  and then do  precodeecho "$WIFI"  /code/pre  to see what it is.  h2Use the codeairport/code command/h2  Since Snow Leopard (at least) there has been an codeairport/code tool at:  code /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /code  Let's call that code$AIRPORT/code for short:  code AIRPORT='/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport' /code  So if we put that together, this emshould/em be the proper command to tell your Mac to join the strongest Wi-Fi signal available:  code ${AIRPORT} ${WIFI} prefs JoinMode=Strongest JoinModeFallback=KeepLooking /code  which is just another way of writing this:  code /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport en0 prefs JoinMode=Strongest JoinModeFallback=KeepLooking /code  h2Use codelaunchd/code/h2  You can automatically run that codeairport/code command periodically with codelaunchd/code.   I have put together the necessary files at https://github.com/tjluoma/airport-autojoin but the idea is this:  ul liUse codelaunchd/code plist in code/Library/LaunchDaemons//code (which must be owned by root:wheel)/li liHave that codelaunchd/code plist watch code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code for changes/li liRun the above command whenever changes occur./li /ul  I am not experiencing this problem in Yosemite, so I cannot guarantee that this will fix it, but it's what I would do to fix it if it kept happening to me.  See the GitHub page for more detailed instructions, including removal.  <answer156891> Apple released the 10.10.1 update today, which is supposed to fix many wifi issues.  <answer197691> I was having issues all the way through 10.10.4, the following fixed the issue on my Early 2013 MBP.  ul liDisable WiFi/li liOpen emFinder/em/li liPress codeCmd+Shft+G/code to go to the folder code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code/li liDelete (or move) the following files:  ul licodecom.apple.airport.preferences.plist/code/li licodeNetworkInterfaces.plist/code/li licodepreferences.plist/code/li /ul/li liRestart your computer/li liRe-enable WiFi/li /ul  <comment184418> I am not able at the moment to walk myself through this in-depth workaround (I found one myself: use a LAN cable over network USB hub).  In case no better answer will come in, I grant you the bounty, yet will not accept this answer for now. <comment184478> +1 to both question and answer - I feel that it will need 10.10.1 to fix. <comment184520> Apple released OS X 10.10.1 today which is expected to fix Wi-Fi issues (which was the first entry in the changelog). You might want to give that a try (after updating your backup, of course). <comment185712> I have it installed and experienced yet another connection drop today. So wile it may fix it for some, I consider this not a solution for me.
