The Download of Apps from the Mac App Store is very slow <body> I've wanted to download an app from the Mac App Store. But the download is much slower than normally.   What can I do?  <answer151475> To download with normal speed again, you can do the following trick:  (These first two steps weren't necessary for me and it worked for me without doing that.)  ol liFirst open System Preferences → Network → Advanced and choose the tab "DNS" and add another DNS-Server by clicking on the kbd+/kbd. A list of free DNS-Servers can be found at about.com. /li liNow we choose a third Level DNS (Primary DNS 209.244.0.3, Secondary DNS 209.244.0.4)/li liNow we have to flush the DNS-Cache of the system, that OSX can use the new DNS-Servers.  ul liemCommand under Mavericks:/em  precodesudo dscacheutil -flushcache /code/pre/li liemCommand under Mountain Lion:/em  precodesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre/li /ul/li /ol  The reason this may improve download speeds is that DNS servers may return endpoints to Apple's CDN according to the location they think you are coming from.  If you use a general one (not one from your ISP, or otherwise close to your location) you may get a CDN endpoint that is not optimal for you, resulting in slow/stalled downloads.  <comment178304> Have you tried different internet connections?  Are other internet things slow?  Have you tried rebooting?  Go to speedtest.net - what speed do you get? <comment178472> Also it would be helpful if you answered the **why** of needing to change DNS servers. The speed of DNS resolution may impact the speed at which a file begins downloading, but it should not have any affect once the file is downloading.
