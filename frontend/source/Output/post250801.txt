Macbook Pro Speaker's cover removal <body> I am getting distorted and noisy sound in my macbook pro mid 2012 model. This happens when music with high basss is played. So, I opened it and found that the outer cover (don't know if thats called something else in this context) has some punctures for long usage. When music is played that punctured cover vibrates and causes the noise in the sound.   If I press and he hold it so that it can't vibrate then sound is fine and no noise generated.   I would like to know from experts, is there any problem if i remove this cover ? And whats the alternative and better solution? I can't replace the speaker in this moment.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b62Kq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment311572> That black circular piece you've photographed there is the speaker cone, not its cover. <comment311684> Yeah, thats correct. I understood it when I actually opened it up, It's not a cover. I sealed the punctured area with glue. <comment311720> Hm. Did that help? <comment311867> I sealed the torn parts in the circular edges with glue. Thats what's been suggested in some videos. Thats apparently solves the problem, not sure what will happen in long term. Sound is not fully perfect but good enough.
