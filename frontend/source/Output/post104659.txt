Blink / fade out to where the text-cursor is - Effect? <body> I just installed an application (MousePos√©)(which many of you will love) to show me where my mousecursor is, after pressing a shortcut,  However: very often when I'm programming, especially after CMD-Tab, I can't remember/see where my text-cursor is.   Does there exists an application that fades out the screen, until at the point of where the text-cursor is, like MousePose does with the mouse cursor?  In fact, it's like an Lightbox effect, where your whole screen gets fade-out and only the thing that matters (your text-cursor) shows in perfect glory, with no dimmed light.  Just like this, but when with the text-cursor, instead of the mouse-cursor  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Njbj.jpg" alt="Example"  Thanks!  <answer104667> I don't know of a program that works system-wide, but if you use the terminal moderately, iterm2 has this feature. Pressing Command-/ once will show the cursor with some screen fade, and pressing and holding it will white out everything on screen but the cursor.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/PiZVqCh.png" alt="Fade" img src="https://i.imgur.com/j1CCLJy.png" alt="Whiteout"  Alternatively, not the same as fading, but there might be a way to have your text editor highlight vertical and horizontal columns. (Here's a plugin for sublime).  <comment123172> Thanks for your suggestion, but I'm really looking for a system-wide application. Since the text-cursor is something native of the OS, I guess it shouldn't be that hard. Same like the Mouse-cursor
