How do I find my screenshot directory (I already changed it) <body> How do I find my screenshot directory? I already know how to change the screenshot directory, because I did it a long time ago, but now I don't know what it is, because I've done it on several different computers.  <answer222661> You could change it again to a folder you can find, perhaps the previous location will also be shown. If you haven't changed it on your current mac, screenshots wil be stored at your desktop  <answer222662> If you've changed the location, thenbr codedefaults read com.apple.screencapture location/codebr will show you.  If you haven't changed it, i.e. it's still set to the default Desktop &amp; has never been redirected, it will error withbr codeThe domain/default pair of (/Users/[user]/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture, location) does not exist/code
