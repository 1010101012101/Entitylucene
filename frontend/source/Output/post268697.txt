How to quickly move mouse cursor between monitors? <body> I have two external monitors, positioned horizontally on each side of my MacBook Pro. When I am working in the far left or far right screens, I find it a little annoying to have to move the cursor all the way across to get to the opposite side (usually requires multiple swipes on the touchpad).   Is there some easier way to do this? I already have BetterTouchTool installed but did not see anything in there that would do this. I was thinking of some kind of key combo shortcut I could use that would jump the cursor to the next screen.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wPh9U.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268735> mousebeam I havent used it but I use another app from the same developer  mousebeam  <answer268861> I tried Mousebeam from the Mac App Store and it does exactly what I wanted. I can now use keyboard shortcuts to jump the mouse to the middle of a specific screen.  <answer268929> This is definitely possible by using BetterTouchTool.  Since you already have it, there is no need to install a new software. Also it has a lot of other options, so I prefer it.  Anyways, here is how you do it:  ol liGo to strongBetterTouchTool/strong codePreferences/code code=&gt;/code codeKeyboard/code./li liClick codeAdd New Shortcut or Key Sequence/code button./li liAssign new Keyboard Shortcut from codeClick to record shortcut/code  for example, for Monitor-1 codeControl+Shift+1/code, for Monitor-2 codeControl+Shift+2/code etc./li liThen from codeTrigger Predefined Action/code dropdown menu, select  codeOther Mouse Actions/code code=&gt;/code codeMove Mouse To Position/code/li liA modal window will appear to capture your desired mouse position. Simply take your cursor to the desired position of a Monitor and Press codeSpace/code to capture the position. Now codeSave/code the position in the Modal Window./li liRepeat code2/code to code5/code for all your Monitors./li /ol  Now you'll be able to jump your mouse cursor to Monitor-1 by pressing codeControl+Shift+1/code, to Monitor-2 by pressing codeControl+Shift+2/code and to Monitor-3 by pressing codeControl+Shift+3/code.  All the best.  <answer269229> Apple mouse and trackpad reaction is strongly affected by speed of movement. Put a mouse in one corner. now drag the mouse very slowly. Back to the corner. now drag faster. you'll see that for the same physical space the mouse moved, you got double/tripple the amount of pixels when you move faster.   Now if you move fast enough, like flicking (or swift swipes on a trackpad) you should be able to cover the whole desktop space in a single movement.   If that's not working for you - open the control panel, and speed up the mouse/trackpad Tracking Speed a little. That should do the trick.  <comment337424> Upvote because I think it would be a cool trick if there's something out there that can do it... however afaik, it's not possible :/ <comment337447> What version of macOS are you running? <comment337453> El Capitan 10.11.6 on the machine in question here but I also use machines running Sierra <comment337651> Can you please describe how your answer is different from the answer @Junme already gave? <comment337706> @fsb This answer here at explains how the recommended tool works, which actually is better than the earlier one. <comment337707> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment338259> While this is true, sometimes a keyboard shortcut may be more efficient. For example, when monitor sizes (higher/lower resolution) are largely varied, you will not be able to go from one monitor to another with a linear movement from all the positions. <comment338379> Never would have found this feature on my own, thanks. This appears to be working well. I actually have multiple monitor setups with the same laptop in different offices, so I'll have to play with it a bit to find a configuration that plays well with all monitor configurations. <comment373977> Ironically, I found the easiest solution to this was to just get a single large external monitor and a physical mouse. Utilizing the 'Spaces' feature of macOS also helps.
