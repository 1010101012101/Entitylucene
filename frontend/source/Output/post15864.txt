Angle Bracket Characters in Apple TV2 On Screen Keyboard <body> I've speen a while trying to figure this out to no avail.  On 4.3.1 Apple TV2's Onscreen Keyboard, I can't find some characters, in particular angle brackets (&lt; and ).  I know some characters can be accessed by holding select over the 'master' character, but none of them seem to have &lt; and  in 4.3.  They were present in 4.2 firmware version keyboard, which was of a different design.  Thanks in advance!  <answer23985> There never was a solution I found; but by using an iOS device (ipod Touch, iphone, ipad) and the Remote app, a full ability to type into boxes was enabled and allowed me to work around this problem.  <comment17250> I don't have an AppleTV so I'm taking a stab in the dark. What bracketing type of characters does the AppleTV have? Would the angle bracket characters not be under the parenthesis `( )`'s, or right angle brackets `[ ]`'s?  I would expect that there wouldn't be curly brackets `{ }`'s built in, but they might be in the same location. <comment17604> I thought of that; and while it does have curly braces, I can't find angle brackets under any of them.  It wasn't under any brackets at all that I saw. <comment17621> Seriously? Curly brackets but no Angle Brackets? Scary...
