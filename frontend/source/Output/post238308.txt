How can I get my iMac to boot into recovery mode? <body> I'm trying to get into recovery mode on my mid-2011 iMac but after holding kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd R /kbd after the startup noise and until I see the Apple logo it then shows me the loading bar as per usual but then after about 30 seconds of loading the bar will be completely full and my computer will shut off completely. I know it's completely powered off because the LED's on my mouse aren't lit up.   Anybody have any idea as to what is happening or how I can actually get my computer to load into recovery mode properly?  I'm currently waiting for the download to finish in Internet recovery mode kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd  kbd R /kbd to see if I have any luck here.  <comment292206> This site works better with one question per question.
