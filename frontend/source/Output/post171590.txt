My iPhone 6 is frozen after resetting it while jailbroken <body> My friend wanted to jailbreak my phone and she took it and jailbroke it then I told her I didn't want it so I restarted it and now my phone is stuck on the apple logo with a loading bar at the bottom. Is there a way I can fix it? Will apple fix it if I tell them?   <answer171600> You can restore your iPhone follow this instruction OR ask Apple do the restore for you.  <answer201143> Run iTunes on PC and make sure that you are using the latest iTunes.
