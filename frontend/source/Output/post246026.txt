What is the X Server equivalent on OSX? <body> What is the X Server equivalent on OSX? I am not looking for XQuartz. What component of the OSX is responsible for rendering graphics? Just as X11 does for *nix.  <answer246156> What I was looking for turns out to be the display server called The Quartz Compositor that along with Quartz 2D forms the Core Graphics framework of the OSX.  X Quartz seems to be the interface that routes requests from applications that use the X11 framework to the Quartz Compositor.  <comment303305> Do you want to know how windows and graphics in general are rendered in OSX **or** do you want to know how to access a Mac remotely? These are two different things, please edit your question to focus on one. You can always ask the other part in a separate question. <comment303308> @patrix  Okay. I removed the part asking about the X11 forwarding. I want to know how graphics are handled on the OSX. In any case I thought that the answer to the "Is there a way to natively forward GUI elements" would be a "yes, software name" or "No." :-)
