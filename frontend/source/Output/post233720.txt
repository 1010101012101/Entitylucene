App submission and approval on Hackintosh (2016) <body> We just recently developed an iOS app on a iMac. The process to get the approval tooks us 15 days.   Our Mac got damaged and won't turn on. We need to keep developing while the Mac is on repair. strongWill there be any trouble for the submission and approval of our app if we develop it on a Hackintosh?/strong  I know that there are a lot of similar questions but those relate of 2011. Now I think Apple has got more strict in the reviews of the apps, so I would like to know please how are they managing this in the recent days. Thanks  <comment285603> You would risk your reputation with Apple by breaking the software license for OS X rather than get a loaner Mac to run builds for the week or two it might take? Also - how would you know the compiler would work correctly and then you'd have a problematic build on the app store live in customer's hands?
