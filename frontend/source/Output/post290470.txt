In the iOS Mail app, is there a way to make the email addresses appear instead of "Smart Addresses" <body> Recently, partially due to my own stupidity, I clicked on a phishing email sent to me that looked like it came from Apple regarding my Apple ID having been used to log in to a device in some Eastern European country.  Upon clicking on the link, it became obvious that I wasn't on apple.com and, on closer inspection, the "Apple" email address was from a non-apple.com domain.  I thought to myself, if there was a way to disable these "Smart Addresses", I would have seen the crazy email address (a random collection of letters and numbers) and would have known it wasn't Apple immediately and would never have clicked on the link.  I found this related Mail.app question from 2013 but there is no similar setting in the iOS version of Mail.  I've looked on Google for a solution to this and, as of yet, all of the searches only return hits about Mail.app, not the iOS Mail app.
