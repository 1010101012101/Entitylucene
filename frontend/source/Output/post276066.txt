Show all x-axis markers for Numbers' bar graphs <body> With Numbers' bar graph, I'd like to show strongall/strong x-axis markers of my table, or at least selected few with all the columns present.  but only a few is displayed when there are many. The only way to show more is to drag to enlarge the chart, but this makes the chart unreadable if I attach it in a post.  How to I achieve what I want without resizing the graph or cut down my data columns?  <answer276086> Select the chart, then in the Format inspector, choose Axis → Category (X) and under Category Labels choose strongShow All Category Labels/strong.                                                  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W7eW4.png" width="275"  All the columns are always present in the graph regardless of this option, however they will be unlabelled.
