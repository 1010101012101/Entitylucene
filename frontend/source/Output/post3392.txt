What does the plus sign next to the price of an app in the App Store mean? <body> There is often a plus sign in the upper left corner of the price button for an app. Even some free apps have this plus sign.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KAfw8.png" alt="image from AppStore"  <answer3393> It means that it is a universal app, able to run on the iPad and iPhone.  <answer28221> It means there are in-app purchases available under that app.  You can turn that feature off under your General Settings, Restrictions.  <comment3079> I thought it means the app has in-app purchases. That would be a lot more useful - and a more intuitive use for that + icon. <comment19496> Maybe apps with in app purchase should have two currency symbols. $$ or ££ It sure would be nice, but I doubt it would fly. <comment19533> Do you want to be looking for apps with in-app purchases? It makes sense to do an icon if its something you want to quickly find (such as ability to run the app on both devices). <comment32386> In-App purchases are considered extras and are 'less important' than conveying that the app itself is a universal binary. <comment83765> The accepted answer is clear here - the + indicates the device works on iPad sized screens as well as iPhone sized screens by having code and graphic layouts to support both from the same app.
