Mac pro tower 2.4Ghz,SATA port Not working <body> Mac pro 2.4 GHz sata  HDD not seen ,can you suggest us how do sata  port not working but logic board is working any option to repair sata  port   <comment338411> This question is very difficult to understand. Which model Mac Pro? What OS? Which SATA port? Mac Pros have 6. What have you tried to fix the problem? Are you sure you don't have a broken HDD? Have you tried the same HDD on other ports and a different HDD on the broken port?
