How to reset file icons associated with default program on El Capitan <body> I've uninstalled my former default text editor which I used for many different file formats. Unfortunately the associated icons are not removed automatically. As a result, several file types still use the icon of the program, even though it's not on my machine anymore.  There a several similar questions around here and this one seemed to be most promising, but it doesn't work on El Capitan (version 10.11.5). Does anyone how I can achieve this on a current version of Mac OS X?  strongEDIT:/strong After assigning a new default program (no matter if I do that via RCDefaultApp or Finder), the old icon remains. If, for instance, I choose Atom as the new default editor for XML files, the former editor icon (Emacs) is still there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7pwo5.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer246752> Have you tried just setting a new default to one document, Get Info on one example, select a new app from the 'Open With' drop menu then hit the 'Change all' button below [hidden below drop menu in photo]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4yvUO.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, RCDefaultApp [freeware, old but still works well] can change many aspects of file association.  <comment304413> Assigning a new default program works, but it's annoying to do that manually.  However, RCDefaultApp looks great! Seems to give the overview I'm looking for. Is there no such service pre-installed (e.g. within system preferences)?  Unfortunately I'm not able to upvote with a repuation less than 15, but I'm gonna checkout RCDefaultApp later and accept the answer if it does what I want. <comment304414> Strangely, there's never been a Mac 'service' of any kind that could do this task. Last App I recall that could do it [possibly back in OS 9 days], was Netscape. RCDefaultApp has kind of become the unofficial de-facto standard. <comment305275> Unfortunately I have to withdraw accepting your answer (see edit).
