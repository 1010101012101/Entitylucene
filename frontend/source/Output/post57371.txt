Preventing iOS devices from sleeping <body> Is there any straight forward way of preventing an iOS device from sleeping?  The only way I found so far is to open the "Music" app and start playing (and muting the volume if I don't really want to listen to anything), but this feels like a hack, and I'm not sure if it works when the device is running on batteries.  <answer57372> Yes you can, go to:  strongSettings  General  Auto-Lock  Never/strong
