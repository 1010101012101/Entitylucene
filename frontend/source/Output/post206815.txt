Unable to format external HDD <body> When creating a partition with GUID Partition Map Scheme in Disk Utility, I'm getting "Partition failed with the error: Unable to write to the last block of the device". Same message when I try to erase the whole volume. Same for formatting for Mac OS Extended emEncrypted/em.   Trying to write to the disk from /dev/random prior to formatting doesn't change anything.  Filling with zeroes:  precode$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk1 dd: /dev/disk1: Resource busy /code/pre  ...and later:  precode$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk1 dd: /dev/disk1: Input/output error 1+0 records in 0+0 records out 0 bytes transferred in 0.250087 secs (0 bytes/sec) /code/pre  Running diskutil:  precode$ diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ "ext" /dev/disk1 Started erase on disk1 Unmounting disk Error: -69760: Unable to write to the last block of the device /code/pre  After all this, Windows sees the disk as an empty HFS volume, but when I try to re-format it with Windows Explorer, it reports: code"Windows was unable to complete the format"/code.  Using diskpart under Windows, "format" action remained stuck at 0% for 2 hours (which for a 500GB looks should be definitely "frozen"):  precodeDISKPART&gt; clean DiskPart succeeded in cleaning the disk.

If ever I get that "Unable to write to the last block of the device" error on SD Cards they just go in the bin; already too far gone to be worth the effort. I handle hundreds of SD Cards for work, so my attitude to them is rather cavalier, but they're not worth fighting once they start to go bad. One trick is to format GUID/HFS, then MBR/FAT16 [or 32, depending on size] Sometimes gets one more round out of them. Whatever you do, don't put anything mission-critical on one. <comment249556> External HDD, in an USB 3.0 enclosure connected to USB 2.0 of Macbook Air mid-2011 13" / Macbook Pro late-2010 13". The enclosure works fine with another HDD. @Tetsujin <comment249559> "to format GUID/HFS, then MBR/FAT16 [or 32, depending on size]" -- just tried that with OS X for GUID/HFS, then with Windows for MBR/FAT32. Is that what you meant? <comment249560> The 'trick' is to do the opposite of what you want, then what you want it to be, just to try shake things up a bit. I would do it all in Disk Utility, not swap between Mac & Win. I usually do it from Applescript, cmd to do MBR/FAT32 would be `do shell script "diskutil eraseDisk \"MS-DOS\" " & diskName & " MBRFormat disk6"` [make sure the disk6 is the appropriate device <comment249626> Updated the question with the output. Still "Unable to write to the last block of the device" repeatedly. @Tetsujin <comment249678> Sorry, I'm pretty much out of ideas, except maybe to try find the drive manufacturer's own formatting tool & give that a go
