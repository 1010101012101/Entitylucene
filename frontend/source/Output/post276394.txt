Error: "The device does not have the necessary services" when using bluetooth to browse files on Galaxy S7 Edge <body> How do I get the "necessary services" on my Galaxy S7 Edge phone using Android Marshmallow so I can use bluetooth to browse and transfer files between my Macbook Pro and my phone?  The error message "The device does not have the necessary services" shows up after I click the "Browse" button on the "Browse Device" window after selecting my phone as the Bluetooth device.  <comment347888> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software. <comment356290> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question is not about Apple hardware, software, or services as defined in the [Help Center](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help) <comment356298> I disagree. Using android with a MacBook is totally on topic. Now, it might be better on the android site - but it's on topic here. <comment362611> yeah nothing needs to be done in windows, this is an osx problem <comment362636> I just had the same problem when I was trying to pair my S7 to my Macbook Air. It is a very valid Apple hardware related problem. Please let me know if you find a solution.
