How to specify workspace "flattening" in macOS when going from multiple screens to one? <body> Is this even possible?  strongDetails:/strong I work on a MacBook that I hook up to 2 external monitors at work. I use each monitor and have multiple workspaces on each monitor. emWhen I disconnect my monitors, mac flattens out my workspaces/em into a pattern that isn't helpful. Of course, If I rearrange them, then when I reconnect my monitors, they don't go back to the monitors and/or order they were when I first disconnected them.   Is there something I can do to specify how I want the macOS to flatten my workspaces? I figure if i can specify a flattening pattern I won't have to rearrange them, therefore solving my problem. I am cool with a 3rd party app that can help me manage this.  Thanks for the help!
