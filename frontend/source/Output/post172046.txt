Screen annotation software to draw on any app in OSX <body> I want to draw on any app pdfs, videos, code. It would be helpful to aid in demonstration in a class setting for me. Do you know if any such app exists that does not require an external pen i.e. using mouse or trackpad to draw.  <answer172047> This software does exactly that http://ink2go.org/ allows the user to draw on any application. It also allows for screen recording and other features. I suggest if you are looking for other alternatives to search for "screen annotation software for mac" that gave me more precise results.  <answer172054> Check out Snappy App - it allows you to grab any part of your screen and float it above the screen - then you can draw on it, change its transparency, shrink it down, whatever. There's a free version which does more or less all you'd want and the in-app purchases are very cheap (you need an in-app to draw on things).  <answer176024> Screenink is also another app that will take a screenshot for the moment and allow you to draw on that, annotate and save.  <answer236352> There is one brand new app for drawing on your screen, it's Vill Q  If even provide undo and redo while drawing and other useful features.  <comment255868> This is definitely the best one. I used to use CloudApp($99 per year) earlier and this app can replace it.
