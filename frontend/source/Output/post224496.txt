Know installation source of PHP <body> I'm finding myself in an awkward situation. I need to install PHP and Nginx for development but I do not want to mess up my Mac with multiple installations. I have found that PHP and PHP-fpm are already installed. I would like to uninstall but I have no clue on how to do it as I don't know through what means it has been installed (Brew or Ports).  I have searched the php binary and it is in code/usr/bin//code  precodePHP 5.5.30 (cli) (built: Oct 23 2015 17:21:45)  Copyright (c) 1997-2015 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.5.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2015 Zend Technologies  Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 /code/pre  <answer224500> codePHP 5.5.30 (cli) (built: Oct 23 2015 17:21:45)/code is the version of codephp/code shipped by Apple with OS X 10.11.3.  You can use brew to install a current version of codephp/code – without affecting the built-in version.  codebrew/code installs its binaries in code/usr/local/Cellar/code. A modification to your codePATH/code ensures the brew installed version is found before the OS X provided version.  MacPorts uses a similar approach. Which package provider you use is a matter of personal preference.  h2Install php via brew/h2  To install codephp/code via codebrew/code, first install codebrew/code using the instructions on their web site:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  Then install codephp/code:  precodebrew install php /code/pre  h2Remove php via brew/h2  When you need to remove codephp/code installed via codebrew/code – thus reverting codephp/code back to the version shipped with OS X – run:  precodebrew uninstall php /code/pre  <comment272262> Anything in /usr/bin is installed via Apple and should not be touched. However if you have both macports and homebrew and you asking this sort of question you will have problems I would reinstall OS X from scratch and choose only one package manager <comment272263> `php` is included with OS X. Please can you add the output of `/usr/bin/php --version` and the version of OS X you are using.
