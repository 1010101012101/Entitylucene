How to format multiple exFAT partitions on USB drive? <body> I'm following the instructions in Creating a bootable Clonezilla dual partition USB device but using my Mac laptop running El-Capitan.  I managed to create an MBR partition table and two partitions on the external USB drive using OSX' codefdisk/code utility but I failed to find a way to format the existing partitions to ExFAT.  All the references I found so far point to codediskutil eraseDisk/code or suggest using Windows or Linux for that, but I don't have access to bare-iron servers with these OS's and failed to access the unformatted USB drive from VirtualBox virtual machines on my laptop.  So, the question is - "Is there a way to execute the equivalent of codemkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1/code on OS X?"  <answer218824> To format an ExFAT partition, unmount the partition and use code(sudo) newfs_exfat [options] /dev/disk*s*/code. Check codeman newfs_exfat/code for the options.  The default FAT-size is 32bit, so you don't have to (or more precisely: you can't easily) specify the -F option.  Typically the Terminal commands should look like this:  precodediskutil list #to get the disk identifier of the exFAT partition diskutil unmount /dev/diskxsy sudo newfs_exfat -v Name /dev/diskxsy /code/pre  <comment264561> Thanks! I managed to execute the commands you suggest.
