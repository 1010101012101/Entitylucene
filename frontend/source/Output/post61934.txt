I have lost the prompt on Terminal on my Mac; unable to get commands to work <body> I was trying to launch a few Java applications using the terminal. The command that I was instructed to launch it with (I was following a guide) was the following:  precode#!/bin/bash cd "$( dirname "$0" )" java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar craftbukkit.jar /code/pre  It worked the first time, which was a test run, so I hide the terminal window to work on some other things. But when I opened the terminal window back up again, I noticed that I had lost my coderoot@pcname:~$/code prompt that usually starts with my terminal opening up.  I have tried to kill anything running in the background but nothing seems to work. When I enter a command it just moves me to the next line without executing anything. Please help and answer in simple terms, as I am not incredibly Terminal-savvy. Thanks!  <answer61935> type  precodesu /code/pre  and enter the root password, or better, use codesudo/code in front of codejava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar craftbukkit.jar/code  <answer61971> It would be help to see the guide you have been following. It seems like you started a bash script.  If you want to simply regain root rights use codesudo su/code.  You can also use codewhoami/code to verify your username you are currently logged in on the terminal.  <answer61976> Your command is still running. Type kbdCtrl-Z/kbd to get your prompt back, followed by codebg/code and kbdEnter/kbd to let Minecraft continue in the background.   If you want to avoid similar issues in the future, call either the shell script itself or at least java with code&amp;/code at the end to put it into the background directly:  precodejava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar craftbukkit.jar &amp; /code/pre  <comment71554> And how exactly does this solve the problem described in the question?
