How to approve iPhone if you have no other device? <body> After upgrading to latest iOS I get a message asking to approve my phone from another device.   Problem 1: strongI do not/strong have another device. Is apple forcing customers to have more than one device? or how do i fix this?   Problem 2: It also gives me a message, "Can't approve this iPhone". If I click there it warns you that the only way to continue will be by resetting all my info on iCloud which is something I DO NOT WANT to do.  <answer294782> There should be the option to receive a SMS code instead (if you have a phone linked to your Apple ID). If you didn't receive this option whilst setting up your iPhone then skip and once you are in the springboard you can go into settings and do so via the iCloud settings panel.  <comment371987> Do you have access to a computer that you can log into your iCloud account with? Another phone number? That is basically what they are asking for. <comment371992> Not exactly a duplicate, but this answer may resolve your issue: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/291055/got-a-new-iphone-where-am-i-supposed-to-receive-the-verification-code
