Is it possible to have multiple filevault2-activated partitions on one disk? <body> What I would like to have: A disk with the following systems on it:  ol liOS X 10.8 (FV2-encrypted)/li liOS X 10.9 (FV2-encrypted)/li liWindows 7/li /ol  When I try to start FV2-encryption on my secondary partition, OS X tells me that in some configurations FV2 cannot be activated. Do you know if this can be done? How?  Bonus question: The Bootcamp partition is not available in the boot menu after installing 10.9. Is it possible to have multiple OS X + Bootcamp live together on one disk?  <answer145303> It looks like probably not, based on a few search results :(  http://macs.about.com/od/LionTipsNtricks/ss/Filevault-2-Using-Disk-Encryption-With-Os-X-Lion.htm says:     FileVault 2 [...] only encrypts the startup drive. If you have   additional drives or partitions, including a Windows partition created   with Boot Camp, they will remain unencrypted.   This thread, however, is a bit encouraging: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5644065  On page 2, someone links to https://github.com/jridgewell/unlock which might be useful. That is, you might be able to set up a pre-login step to unlock additional volumes.  <comment179184> Unfortunately this answer misses the point. The first article is too generic and the Apple discussion is about two separate disks. <comment244015> Can you please elaborate how you created the second partition? I created mine by 1st) shrinking the existing FileVault 2 encrypted CoreStorage volume using "diskutil cs resizeVolume ..." and 2nd) creating a new and unencrypted CoreStorage volume using "diskutil cs createVolume ...". However, the system always boots the original FV2 encrypted volume although I select the second volume for boot in Startup manager.
