LAN map for Mac OS X <body> I'm looking for a program that will create a visual map of my home network, I've found stronglanmap/strong but it requires too many programs to be installed to be able to run.   Does anyone knows a native Mac app for the job?  <answer11106> Check out nmap with the zenmap GUI. It's normally a port scanner but it creates visual maps of what you scan.  <answer11122> iNet for Mac is avail­able for down­load at the App­Store. It is a native osx app that shows you what your mac is connected to.  <comment11625> iNet is a great iOS app. Nice to see it in the Mac App Store. The interface looks really great from the screenshots. <comment52747> +1 because this app rocks the Casbah.
