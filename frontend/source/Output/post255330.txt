mdfind and the apostrophe <body> In terminal if I type  precodemdfind -onlyin ~/"Desktop/Shows I Watch" "Bob" /code/pre  I get the output     /Users/brendans/Desktop/Shows I Watch/Bob's Burgers   As I would expect. But if I try  precodemdfind -onlyin ~/"Desktop/Shows I Watch" "Bob's Burgers" /code/pre  I get nothing. I've tried lots of different escape keys for the apostrophe, but they all return nothing.   Here's a list of everything I've tried:  precodemdfind -onlyin ~/"Desktop/Shows I Watch" "Bob\'s Burgers" mdfind -onlyin ~/"Desktop/Shows I Watch" "Bob\''s Burgers" mdfind -onlyin ~/"Desktop/Shows I Watch" "Bob''s Burgers" mdfind -onlyin ~/"Desktop/Shows I Watch" "Bob\\'s Burgers" mdfind -onlyin ~/"Desktop/Shows I Watch" "'Bob'\\''s Burgers'" /code/pre  What am I missing here?!?  <answer255337> You need to escape the single apostrophe with a single backslash and do not quote the show name if it has an apostrophe, just escape any spaces with a single backslash too, as in the examples below:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code$ mdfind -onlyin ~/Desktop/"Shows I Watch" Bob\'s\ Burgers /Users/name/Desktop/Shows I Watch/Bob's Burgers $ mdfind -onlyin ~/Desktop/Shows\ I\ Watch Bob\'s\ Burgers /Users/name/Desktop/Shows I Watch/Bob's Burgers $  /code/pre  It should actually work with the show name in quotes as in the first example you have under "Here's a list of everything I've tried:", it worked on my system.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code$ mdfind -onlyin ~/"Desktop/Shows I Watch" "Bob\'s Burgers" /Users/name/Desktop/Shows I Watch/Bob's Burgers $  /code/pre  <comment318012> Thank you so much. mdfind -onlyin ~/Desktop/"Shows I Watch" Bob\'s\ Burgers  works as expected.
