iPhone 5s home button and on-screen home button unreliable <body> The home button on a friend's iPhone 5s has become unreliable. It responds maybe one time out of twenty.  Till she could visit an Apple Store to get them to check it, I enabled the AssistiveTouch option to give her an on-screen home button. But the on-screen home button is similarly unreliable, only responding a fraction of the time. Other buttons on the AssistiveTouch control work fine.  Given that the on-screen home button is also unreliable this suggests it isn't a hardware problem. Has any seen this before? Can anyone suggest what the cause could be or how to resolve it?  <comment330790> Software version? Could this have started right after a software update? Have you tried basic troubleshooting (cycling Wifi on/off, removing SIM card, turning bluetooth & hotspot off, restarting phone, etc.)? <comment330799> maybe it's because the iOS version is high (maybe 9) and the processor can't keep up with it. <comment333842> @Hackman The phone is otherwise fine. Obviously it's not as fast as a current gen phone but it is perfectly usable, aside from the issues with the hardware / software buttons. <comment333843> @owlswipe Not sure when this started, but the phone has since had at least one software update. It's been power cycled multiple times. Turning off/on Wifi/Bluetooth/etc made no difference. <comment333866> OK, I think the best suggestion is to just contact Apple at https://getsupport.apple.com, they'll try to fix it and if they can't they'll just hook your friend up with a free replacement. <comment333873> @owlswipe That's probably what'll end up happening, I was just hoping for some insight into why the on-screen button would be affected by the hardware button being faulty. The first time she visited the local store they were talking about replacing the whole screen assembly for over Â£100+. Which is frustrating when the screen itself seems fine.
