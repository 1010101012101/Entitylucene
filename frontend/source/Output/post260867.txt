This script worked fine for me.  precodetell application "Terminal"     activate     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "f" using {control down, command down}     end tell     do script "cd ~/Downloads" in window 1     do script "brew list" in window 1 end tell /code/pre  <comment326610> In the future if you are having problems with a script, please be explicit about _what's wrong_ and any error messages you encountered.
