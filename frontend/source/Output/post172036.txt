iCloud Drive folders not showing on OS X <body> I am seeing some strange behaviour. As you can see here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NK0xw.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have lots of folders I don't see on my Mac (shown here):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A6RO2.png" alt="enter image description here" Not sure why this is. When ever I make a new file or folder on either my Mac or on iCloud.com I see the file/folder. It's just I don't see those default Quicktime folders etc.  <comment202477> are you sure any files are in there ? <comment202478> heya, no the folders are empty - (clean install). surely they should show up though no? <comment202481> I read somewhere they would not show if empty, to test put something in it.
