iPhone 5s unresponsive touch screen <body> I have an iPhone 5s. Recently I have upgraded to iOS 10.1.1 from 10.1. After upggrade, I found that the touch screen started to be unresponsive.  Everytime I turn on the screen by the power button, I can touch or scroll the screen for a few times. Then it will become unresponsive.  And even worse, after a few seconds after unresponsiveness, the screen will behave randomly, just like the link below: iPhone 6 touch screen have problems  When I tried to upgrade from 10.1.1 to 10.1.1 (different build number), it behaved normally again for whole night yesterday.  But starting from this morning, the problem occurs again.  Besides, I have tried rebooting by pressing the power button, the problem still occurs.  As my home button has broken for half a year, I could not hard reboot it.  What are some possible causes for the problem? Thanks.   (My phone is old and out of warranty.I don't really want to pay for hardware replacement. And genius is hard to be booked in my city)
