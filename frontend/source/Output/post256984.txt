How can I resolve "Filter Failed" message from MacOS 10.12? <body> With MacOS 10.12, printing to Canon MX922 wirelessly AND also via USB cable generates this message: "Filter failed" and "cgpdftoraster quit unexpectedly". Responsible item listed as "cgpdftoraster [818]". Does anyone have a solution?  <comment320698> Have you already tried to update your printer drivers? If yes, can you add some more details about where/how the error is reported and what if anything is in log files? <comment321036> This issue resolved itself within 48 hours. I have no idea why error happened or why it is no longer a problem.
