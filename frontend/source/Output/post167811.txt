iTunes - adding content to third party app <body> Prior to this iTunes 12 update, there was a way to navigate to the apps on your iPad and select a third party app from the App Store, then be able to 'add media' to that application. I would put home videos and other content to CineXPlayer this way.   With iTunes 12, I no longer see this option for my third party video player. Is this no longer supported? Are third party video apps out of business?  <answer167814> ul liLaunch iTunes/li liPlug in iDevice, then...  ol liselect iDevice/li liSelect Apps/li liScroll down on the right-most scroll-bar until you see the strongFile Sharing/strong header/li liIn that section, select your app/li /ol/li liThen you can drag &amp; drop to the right section/li /ul  emI shrunk my iTunes window down as small as it would go to show all the info without taking up too much room in here/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p3tG8.png" alt="enter image description here"  Rebooting the phone may help if connectivity is an issue.  <comment196773> Thank you for this. I think that's the problem. My iDevice is no longer showing up in that bar you highlighted (#1) <comment196774> then that's a different issue entirely. Is it plugged in? Does the cable work? Is your USB hub functioning correctly? <comment196775> Debugging right now. It's definitely receiving a charge. So functioning cable isn't the problem. <comment196776> charge & data are not necessarily carried on the same core. At minimum, unplug, reboot phone & try again - or try another cable <comment196778> rebooted and now the devices show up. And following your instructions, everything works as depicted. Thank you! <comment196779> Glad it worked for you :) I'll port some of that info into the answer for future users - comments are ephemeral, answers stay. <comment196823> and that is a + from me for shrinking action :) = very considerate of you. <comment261648> Does this still work? I cant seem to see this on latest iTunes 12.3.1 with iOS Nine <comment261649> Tell me of a Free sample app that it is working for you and I will try it out to test it <comment261651> There's one right there in the picture
