How AC Adapter serial numbers differ/are related between the charger block and the OS X System Report? <body> I need to check that after an unauthorized repair of my MagSafe 1 AC adapter, I get the original Mac-side cable that I gave them and asked to re-use with my adapter.  With another original AC adapter, I can see that its serial number printed on the charger block (XnnnnnnnXnnXXnnXX) is quite different from what OS X System Report displays in the "AC Charger Information: Serial Number" field (0x00hhhhhh). (here X are letters, n are decimal digits, h are hex digits).   Is there any way to make sure that the System Report data actually matches the printed number on the charger?  Alternatively, is there any other way to check that after repair I receive the same Magsafe-side cable (and connector) that I gave them, not some kind of non-genuine replacement?
