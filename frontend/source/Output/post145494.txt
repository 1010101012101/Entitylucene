AppleScript to copy items to USB <body> I really need an AppleScript that would copy items (files, folders everything so whatever is in this folder must be copied) of a folder in my documents to a USB folder, but only when the USB is mounted. So I guess I'll use a folder action or something like that.   So basically the AppleScript must simply copy contests of code/Users/x/Documents/myfolder/code to code/Volumes/usb/myusbFolder/code and only when the copying is complete does it then delete from my folder and start the next one and also overwrite existing folders with the same name just in case the USB was ejected unexpectedly.   I've been looking all over for about a week now so any help would be amazing. I'm still rather new to AppleScript, so the more detail the better.  <comment171478> How about this one: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10554572/2241562 <comment171482> Well its not exactly 100% what i want like i said im not exactly a applescript wizard so cant really modify it proper <comment171484> So when do you want it to run? when you insert the USB ? <comment171485> Yes as soon as the usb is inserted
