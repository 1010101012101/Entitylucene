are there editing commands for voice to text? <body> My iPhone, iPad, and Mac each has the same, excellent voice to text input.  But I have never discovered if there are any voice editing commands, such as:  delete last word, or replace 3rd from last word, etc.  <answer226168> On Mac go to System Preferences - Accessibility - Scroll the list on the left all the way down to Dictation and setup your Dictation commands including those for editing text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zz03E.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hAdr7.png" alt="enter image description here"
