Install and run Linux on partition of external HD? <body> Is it possible to install and run Linux on a partition an external HD in OS X?  Almost all the instructions I've found are about installing to the entire external HD, not to a partition.  I've install emrEFInd/em on a Core2 Duo late 2007 iMac and dd'd a Linux .iso to a FAT-formatted partition on an external FW 800-connected drive, but the drive disappears from Finder and does not appear as an option in emrEFInd/em when the iMac is rebooted.  I have to change the partition format back to OSX Extended (journaled) via selecting emDisk - Partition - click on the particular partition/em in OS X 10.11.6 Disk Utility, and rename it to see it again, which of course wipes out the dd'd .iso. Duh!  Any ideas or is running Linux from an external HD partition impossible?  <answer262275> I think it is possible but you must partition/erase that partition as bootable.
