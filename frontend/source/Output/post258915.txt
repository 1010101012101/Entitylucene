All apps trying to open file hang <body> This one is becoming a huge pain.  Every app where I try to open the file open dialog hangs with the cursor turning into the waiting cursor. E.g.  ul liOpen gmail in Google chrome or Safari, compose a new email and click "attach a file" button./li liOpen a file editor (e.g. Sublime text or Numbers or Keynote), click File - Open./li liTry to log into App Store./li /ul  In all cases the App hangs.  I'm on:  ul liEl Capitan: 10.11.6 (15G1004)/li liMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)/li /ul  Here is a link to Console output when I tried to:  ul liKilled all Safari processes (ps -eaf + kill -9)/li liOpen Safari/li liFile - Open/li liIt hung./li liWait for about a minute./li /ul  <comment323773> Can you provide any error messages you see or errors being logged to Console?  It's very hard, almost impossible, to figure out the issue with the details you've provided so far. <comment323777> @fsb Agreed. Wasn't sure what to provide. Console output added.
