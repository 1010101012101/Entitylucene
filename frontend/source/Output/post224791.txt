how can I search for folders ending in certain characters in Finder? <body> Executing a Finder search for folders seems limited to searching for folder names beginning with the search term. I can't search for folder names only using a characters in the middle or end. I'm having to resort to using the find command from Terminal. Any way around this? Below is a sample folder and multiple search attempts:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xmnJK.png" alt="folder with all subfolders" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VGAcd.png" alt="searching for &quot;son&quot; does not return anything, even though subfolders ending in &quot;son&quot; exist"  This is my first post here so I can only post two images, apparently. I have an additional screen shot showing a search for "jo" which indeed reveals every subfolder beginning with "jo". I have a fourth screen shot showing that a search for "bert" fails to return "robertson" "colbertson" etc. Those searches were both name-based searches with the same "kind" restriction to folders only.  What's up with this?  <answer224792> I haven't found a way to get variables in spotlight, but I emmust/em be misinformed since that seems so useful to not implement.  That being said, I use terminal and codemdfind/code to parse spotlight like you have all the time.  precodemdfind "kMDItemFSName == '*son' &amp;&amp; kMDItemKind == 'Folder'" /code/pre  That will show you all folders ending in codeson/code and you might want to grep for the "sample names" folder name to replicate the search you have illustrated or use the code-onlyin/code command:  precodemdfind -onlyin dir "kMDItemFSName == '*son' &amp;&amp; kMDItemKind == 'Folder'" /code/pre  You can drag the folder into terminal to get a properly escaped name with spaces encoded and then paste that in place of codedir/code  <answer224812> In strongFinder/strong try using this:  precodeKind is Folder Name ends with son /code/pre  This should display all folders ending with "son".  Try also, codebegins with/code and codecontains/code for similar searches.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5RcML.png" alt="Folder name search Finder"  <comment272636> Welcome to Ask Different. - feel free to upload the image and post it as a comment. Someone else can edit it in for you if it's helpful. <comment272638> Whoah. Good to know. Thank you. Definitely faster than using find. Would still love to be able to do it directly from Finder... <comment272675> Omg... well, that works, so thank you. But why is the behavior different between files and folders? I've never had to specify "ends with" when searching for a file ending in "son". I just search for "son" and it works. But it doesn't work with folders. <comment272676> Good subject for [Apple Feedback.](http://www.apple.com/feedback/) Cheers! <comment278262> Wow! Drag into terminal - thank you for that!
