Browser Custom Protocol unsafe <body> Using other helpful answers on the StackExchange community I have a custom URI protocol registered on a client's machine. It points to a simple AppleScript that we can then change as needed. In testing on our Mac here, it works without issue with a link formatted like:  codeoururl://path/here/code  However, when trying to click that url on their machines, in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome, the URL is automatically changed to:  codeunsafe:oururl://path/here/code  So far I've been unable to find any additional information on why the "unsafe:" prefix is being added or how to address it. Any insight or workarounds?  Version info:br OSX 10.6.8br Safari 5.1.10 (6534.59.10)br Firefox 26.0br Chrome Version 30.0.1599.101  Thanks.  <answer117537> It turns out this was much simpler than I thought (as usually happens in software development). Somehow I didn't catch this until user testing, which is what threw me in the direction of thinking it was a Mac issue. It is not a Mac issue.  I'm using the AngularJS framework and one of its "features" is to mark unknown protocols with an unsafe prefix. I used this answer to configure it to recognize mine and now all is well.
