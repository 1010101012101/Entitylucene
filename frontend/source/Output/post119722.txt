Crashs of MBP 13 mid-2010 (MC375LL/A) <body> I am using a a MBP 13 mid-2010 (MC375LL/A) with the following characteristics  precodeMacBookPro 7,1 Intel Core 2 Duo 2.6GHz RAM: 8Gb (2x4Gb in replacement of the 2x2Gb) HDD: WD Blue 500Go 5400trs/min (in replacement of 320Go) GPU: Nvidia 320M 256Mo OSX: Maverick 10.9.1 /code/pre  Use: office software applications + Multimedia + scientific computing and development (one raeson for changing the RAM)  Since the middle of december 2013, the MBP crashes many times a day. It stops by many differents ways:  ul liblack, white, blue, orange or green screen and freezes (I need to hold power button to shutdown);/li licome back to logon screen;/li lireboot (black text on gray brackground screen);/li liscreen with many multicolor lines;/li lijust freeze (I need to hold power button to shutdown);/li /ul  These problems happen with battery (i need to change it (670 cycles)) but also with magsafe. When the MBP crashs, I am not doing special thing (sometimes just on website, sometimes on youtube watching video...) but it is very randomly.  Sometimes I can obtain a Kernel Panic but sometimes not.  You can find at the following link the last kernel panic I obtained http://goo.gl/mPR29q  So I am looking for one solution to deal with this problem.  Thank you in advance  <comment139654> This sounds like a hardware error. I suspect your machine will need to take a trip to an Apple store (or other Apple repair place). <comment139657> @OllyHodgson You confirm that I am thinking. The Apple Store is not close to me therefore I am looking if I can find a solution before I will go to the store. <comment139660> In complement, I thought about a RAM problem (because I changed it with non-Apple RAM module). But I have tried the both module on both so-dimm slots and I obtained the same crashs.... <comment139661> Do you have Apple Care? <comment139662> http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11342 might be helpful? <comment139664> @Robuust no that is why I am looking to one other solution. I will go to the Apple Store next week-end to obtained a non-free diagnose. Unfortunately, after reading many forums I think that the problem seems to come from the GPU and the repair cost more than 500â‚¬ (excluding battery change)... <comment139669> @OllyHodgson Maybe, but I don't have the software disks with me and the D key don't open apple diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test. <comment139684> @OllyHodgson I try to start Apple Hardware Test using "Option+D" (Internet Recovery) but my MBP is not supported by the Apple Hardware Test.... :-(
