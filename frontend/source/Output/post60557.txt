How to change Safari 6 Reader font? <body> In Safari 5 you could just change the Reader.html file inside of the Safari.app to use a sans-serif font. This Reader.html does not exist in Safari 6.  How do I manage to change the font of Safari Reader (6)?  I hate to read serif fonts.  <answer60593> Add a rule like this to code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Safari.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Reader.html/code:  precode.page, h1.title {   font-family: 'Avenir Next' !important; } /code/pre  The code!important/code is required because a code.page/code div has an inline style attribute that overrides the fonts in codeReader.html/code.  <answer168036> You can also change the Reader.html CSS on iPad, iPhone or iPod, confirmed working on iOS8.1.2 iPad Air 2.  You will need to strongJailbreak your iOS device, and download a file system managing app called iFile/strong. Then you'll have full Explorer/Finder functionality on your iOS device.  Next, navigate to the folder:     /var/stash/_.HVRQId/Applications/MobileSafari.app/Reader.html   This is the location on my iPad Air 2 with iOS 8.1.2, it may differ for you. If you upgrade to the paid version of iFile for $4, you can do a search system wide for the Reader.html file, which is what I did.  Open in Text Viewer, now just change the CSS as desired, anywhere you see the "font: -apple-system-*" declaration.   If you want to change the main body typography, strongadd a font-family declaration to the .page tag./strong For example:  precode  .page {         font: -apple-system-body;         text-align: start;         font-family: Georgia; /code/pre  }  You can do the same thing to edit the strongpage heading under the h1.title tag/strong  precodeh1.title {         font: -apple-system-headline;         font-weight: normal;         text-align: start;         -webkit-hyphens: manual;         font-family: Georgia;     } /code/pre  Save Reader.html, reload the Safari webpage, and enjoy your new Reader font!  <comment69720> One sure-working way is to delete the font Safari uses, and make a duplicate of the font you want named the same as what Safari uses. <comment69760> Awesome, thank you! They moved it to a very obscure location.
