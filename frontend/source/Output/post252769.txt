Folder of 24 gigs has only 12 gigs nested. How to account for mysterious bloat? <body> I have a code~/Library/Developer/code used by Xcode.app in El Capitan. The codeFinder/code  codeGet Info/code reports a size of 24 gigs. But the two nested folders each report only 6 gigs each. So ( 2 * 6 ) = 12, and ( 24 - 12 ) = 12. Where is the other 12 mysterious gigs?   I am showing invisible files/folders. So I believe I have not overlooked any other content. I did recently delete much content from there, and emptied the Trash.  How can I track down this huge discrepancy?  Using the codedu/code, the “display disk usage statistics” tool, where code-d/code is depth (Display an entry for all files and directories depth directories deep) and code-h/code is "Human-readable" output (Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte).  strongOuter folder:/strong  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"codecd ~/Library; du -d 1 -h; /code/pre  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code…  11G    ./Developer … /code/pre  strongInner folders:/strong  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"codecd ~/Library/Developer; du -d 1 -h; /code/pre  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code706M    ./CoreSimulator 4.4G    ./Shared 5.9G    ./Xcode  11G    . /code/pre  cd ~/Library; du -d 1 -h;  But the codeGet Info/code reports twice that, 24.x gigs.  <answer252776> h1tl;dr/h1  ul liUse codedu/code tool to see the truth./li liOr, maybe wait a couple of hours./li /ul  h1Details/h1  While shooting a screenshot of the Finder  Get Info showing 24 gigs and the results of the codedu/code command-line tool showing only 11 gigs, the Get Info panel changed with an automatic update. This was after a reboot and after 1-2 hours of repeatedly showing 24 gigs.   So the Finder must be caching information about the folders long after deleting gigs of data in a large numbers of files.  As suggested by tubedogg, use the codedu/code command-line tool to see accurate readings of your folder sizes.  <comment314513> What does `cd ~/Library/Developer;du -d 1 -h` return?
