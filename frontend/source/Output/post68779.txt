Sync an iDevice apps with two Apple IDs <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   2 Apple IDs on one device?       I was planning on getting a new iPhone and I want to give my old one to my younger brother, both of us have different Apple ID. The question is, can I retain my old apps on the old iPhone while syncing/installing my brother's purchased apps in it?  <answer68811> Yes, you can do that. I use two Apple IDs on my iPhone 4S.  It is not the most comfortable setup though: You must switch IDs in SettingsiTunes &amp; App Stores. Just tap on your Apple ID and select Sign Out. Then log in with your brother's Apple ID.  I don't think the iPhone will pull the apps your brother bought when he signs in with his Apple ID. He will have to install them manually.  <comment79955> It won't automatically download his apps when he signs in, but they should appear in the "Purchased" tab of the App Store.
