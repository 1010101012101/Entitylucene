Only two categories visible in purchased iTunes <body> I have two movies, plenty of apps, and two books purchased. I set up Family Sharing with my mother's MacBook Air and she bought a movie (on my credit card). She's already watched it, but I don't see it in my library. She also doesn't see any movies or books I purchased. I read (in other topics) that to view Family Sharing member purchased items I have to open the Purchased menu in the iTunes app, however I see only two categories: Music and Apps. (I never bought any music) Why aren't my books visible? Can you please help me?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jnpa8.png" alt="enter image description here"  I understand that my movies may be not visible because I am in Poland, but books according to this list should be visible: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT5085  <comment207991> Does really nobody know how to solve this frustrating issue? Please help!
