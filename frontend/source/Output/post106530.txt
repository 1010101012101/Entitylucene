launchd won't run a loaded script on reboot <body> so i'm having a few troubles with launchd  I made this plist:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs$ &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;mosek.mountd&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/etc/mountd&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  My problem is this. When i load the script manually:  precodelaunchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/script.plist /code/pre  It works like a charm. It load perfectly, and runs the script as it should. now when I reboot, it loads the script as it should, but now the script won't start. Though when I start the script  precodelaunchctl start mosek.mountd /code/pre  it works. So it must be ignoring the "RunAtLoad" key, when it loads the script on reboot. Why does it do that, and how do I fix it?  cheers in advance  precodeedit:     I forgot to mention that I also made root the owner of the file by running:          chmod root /Library/LaunchDaemons/script.plist     and it still wouldn't work /code/pre  <answer106535> Check your permissions. The file script.plist should look like this  code-rw-r--r--  1 wheel  410 16 .../code   From codeman launchctl/code     Note that per-user configuration files (LaunchAgents) must be owned by the user loading them. All system-wide daemons (LaunchDaemons) must be owned by root. Configuration files must not be group- or world-writable.   <comment125076> Hi. sorry i forgot to mention that. i ran chmod root /Library/LaunchDaemons/script.plist, so I don't think that is the problem <comment125078> the file permission looks like this: -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  404 <comment125081> please try these steps to debug your plist: 1. set the launcdctr log level to debug `sudo launchctl log level debug` (debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency)  2. Tail the system.log `tail -f /var/log/system.log`  3. set the launcdctr log level back to error `sudo launchctl log level error`  from [obscured clarity](http://obscuredclarity.blogspot.de/2011/02/debugging-launchd-configuration-on-mac.html) <comment125085> I tried what you suggested. I unloaded the plist, set the loglevel to debug, loaded the plist, tail the system log. when I tailed the system log, there wasn't anything on my plist. does this mean it didn't run, cause it did, or does it mean, that there aren't any bugs in it? <comment125087> I added a KeepAlive key, and that did the trick. But as far as I understand the KeepAlive key, it runs the process over and over again indefinitely. I wanted it to run a single time when the system rebooted, and not more then that <comment125091> KeepAlive means that if the applications quits or crashes, launchd will restart it.
