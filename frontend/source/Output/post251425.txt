Quicktime freezes every single time I'm finishing a recording <body> I used to be able to take screencasts with QuickTime just fine for over a year now. But suddenly, every time I try and go above 3 or 4 minutes, by the time I finish, QuickTime just freezes. I can only kill it. When opening it the next time, it presents to me only part of the recording.  What could possibly cause this?  I got Yosemite v10.10.5 and QuickTime v10.4 (build 833.7)  <answer251582> @fbara was right: It is the ram, but it is not obvious. Basically, what I am recording now requires a whole variety of software to be open at the same time, quickly reaching the limits of my Air's 4GB of RAM. Once you use more than 70-80% of your ram, stuff starts getting compressed and swapped, and apparently, Quicktime cannot quite work with that.  Solution: Get more RAM and send complaint letters to Quicktime for not informing you why your recordings fail.  <comment312543> Could it be that you're running low on disk space or RAM? <comment312675> Disk space is Ok. Gonna monitor RAM next time. Very few applications are running, so it shouldn't be an issue, but who knows! <comment312788> @fbara You were right (see my answer) :(
