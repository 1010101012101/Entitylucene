Recover Deleted Exchange Account Contact from iPhone <body> So I removed an Exchange account from my iPhone not realizing that the phone had been saving new contacts there by default (instead of to my gmail account).  I no longer have access to that Exchange account, so re-adding it is not an option.  Is there any way to recover the contacts (and export them to a CSV or some other format so I can add them to Gmail)?  Also, the phone was never upgraded to iOS 6, so it's still running iOS 5  <answer99941> If I am understanding the question correctly:  ul liYou had an Exchange account set up on iPhone./li liContacts were being saved to the Exchange account instead of your Google account (also set up on the phone)/li liYou removed the Exchange account and no longer have access to it/li liYou need a contact you added to the Exchange account/li /ul  Assuming all of the above is accurate, then no, there is no way to retrieve it.
