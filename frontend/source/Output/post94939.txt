10.6.8. Can't connect to server via cmd+k or Finder menu or command line. How to connected? <body> My biggest problem is: kbdcmd ⌘/kbdkbdK/kbd (codeConnect to Server…/code) just doesn't work (neither does it exist in the "Go" menu in Finder). When I hit kbdcmd ⌘/kbdkbdK/kbd in Finder it just gives me an error beep (sounds more like a "boup"). I want to connect to a Windows network and it works fine on my 10.8 iMac at work (with kbdcmd ⌘/kbdkbdK/kbd and then typing the correct adress) but doesn't on my home MacBook white with 10.6.8 running. Why does kbdcmd ⌘/kbdkbdK/kbd not work here? Though on both machines the VPN connection works fine. How do I get the option to connect to a server via kbdcmd ⌘/kbdkbdK/kbd back?  Next thing I tried was connecting via command line withbr codemount -t smbfs //username:password@server\folder/code andbr codemount -t smbfs //username:password@server/folder/code.  Both didn't seem to work, just gave me the message:  precodeusage: mount [-dfruvw] [-o options] [-t ufs | external_type] special node        mount [-adfruvw] [-t ufs | external_type]        mount [-dfruvw] special | node /code/pre  Can you help me to get connected to the server?  <answer95152> This question has some suggestions for enabling the missing menu option (that question is about 10.7, but worth a try).  I think the command line version isn't working because you need to provide a final argument, specifying where to mount the shared directory locally.  On my 10.6.8 machine, codeman mount_smbfs/code gives this example:  precodemount -t smbfs //username:userpass@myserver/PUBLIC /smb/public /code/pre  <comment111590> Woohoo, that one worked! Thank you!!! And as I see now, my question maybe could bet set to 'duplicate'...
