MBP can't connect to Starbucks Wi-Fi, only restart helps <body> Tough question to frame ;) .. but I have a situation that plays out often: firing up the laptop (latest MacBook 15") at Starbucks will often never connect unless I restart the entire box. This tells me there is something amiss somewhere, to which I have no clue. I run nothing out of the ordinary and see no pattern.   I wondered if there was a terminal command that could somehow "reset" network settings. The Wi-Fi is seen properly, and attempts the connection but sits and sits and sits. It eventually connects but it is far faster to restart.  Tough one perhaps, just thought to ask.. thx..  <answer154670> Easiest way is to create a new Location. Go to strongSystem Preferences  Network/strong  Click on Location as the top and pick Edit Locations...  Click the + at the bottom and call it Starbucks or something.   <comment181955> I've not had this problem on a MB, but I have on Win7 laptop at $tarbuck$.  On Win7 I've discovered I can toggle wifi off and back on and win7 will the connect correctly.  I've never figured out why it doesn't like to on the first try. <comment181956> PS- Suggestion for a title revision... drop "secret to", including those words makes it seem like you're seeking a loophole to the normal connection. <comment182160> thanks Prof.. i will set one up and see how it goes. <comment317576> This, and every possible solution i can muster, makes not difference. The only solution i can find is to reset my laptop... not a huge deal due to the SSD but still a pain.  And thanks, the title edit was perfect.
