How to create a new Snippet in TextMate 2's Bundle Editor? <body> I'm looking at an existing Bundle in TextMate 2's Bundle Editor. strongHow do I create a new (editable) Snippet in the currently selected Bundle?/strong  Seems like this should be obvious, but I am stumped. Searching the Main Menu contents doesn't reveal any menu commands which would obviously allow Snippet creation. Right-clicking in various related areas of the UI (in hopes of opening a context menu) has proven fruitless.  Isn't there a way to create a new Snippet inside the TextMate 2 app itself (presumably in the Bundle Editor)? Or do I have to edit plist .tmbundles to create Snippets? I could have sworn you could easily do this in TextMate 1.  The official TextMate docs seem to be version 1.x-specific.  <answer126940> In the bundle editor window, choose File â€º New (or Cmd + N) and you'll get a sheet like this:  http://f.cl.ly/items/3w1e3h1B3J1G1R0p3Z32/Screenshot%202014-04-08%2022.13.45.png  Just choose 'Snippet' from that drop down.  <comment148691> Perfect, thank you. I can't believe I didn't think to try this. <comment148693> Well, it's not like it makes any sense, at all. I remember banging my head against the table for *days* before finally stumbling on this... <comment148695> I don't feel so bad about "only" loosing 30 minutes now :).
