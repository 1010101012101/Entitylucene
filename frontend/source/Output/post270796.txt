Transfer formula result from one tab to another on iCloud Numbers <body> On Numbers for iCloud, how do I transfer a formula result from one cell to another on a different tab, but in the same spreadsheet?  <answer270805> I just tested this to be sure it worked. Go to the cell you want to copy and choose "Edit  Copy" or Hold down the Command key strongWHILE/strong pressing the C key. Switch to the tab and cell you want to paste into then choose "Edit  Paste Formula Results" or Hold down the Command key AND Shift key strongWHILE/strong pressing the V key.  <comment340752> Thank you for the input, but the thing is that this way it doen't update the results... <comment340766> what results? you need to clarify **EXACTLY** what is happening versus what you **want** to have happen.
