Migration Assistant unexpectedly quit loading from time machine <body> I have MBP 17 inch early 2011. New logic board with El Capitan. I have a time capsule that is recognized, and begins calculating how much is going to migrate. It gets about 2/3 to 3/4 done (my estimate) and it quits. I get a message that I can try later. I am connecting with Ethernet directly to the time machine.
