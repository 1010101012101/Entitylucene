Keyboard-only folder navigation with auto complete <body> This is one feature of Windows 7 Start menu that I haven't been able to replace in OS X ML. In Windows:  ol liPress Windows key/li liStart typing, for example: H:\folder\phot/li liUse arrow keys to highlight the "search-complete": H:\folder\photos/li liPress Enter and voila, the folder is opened in Windows Explorer. Similarly for files./li /ol  I know that Alfred Powerpack can navigate by keyboard-only, but it is not as intuitive and fast (it doesn't have "search-complete", and it's cumbersome for mounted folders e.g. typing out \Volumes\H\folder\photos).  <answer70918> Finder offers the strongGo to Folder/strong function (found in the Go menu, or by pressing ⇧⌘G), which allows you to type in a path, and has tab-completion (i.e. typing code/us TAB r TAB doc TAB/code gets code/Users/rob/Documents//code).  It's not perfect, the main downfall is that it doesn't present multiple options, it just chooses the last alphabetical match (i.e. if you type codedo/code, in a folder with codeDocuments/code and codeDownloads/code, it will auto-complete as codeDownloads/code), but it is a decent built-in functionality.  <answer70952> If you have the Alfred Powerpack, you can also assign shortcuts for opening the file browser in specific folders.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChpeL.png" alt=""  <answer70956> Just to add a strongterminal/strong option, you can open the terminal (I use iTerm2) and navigate folders with auto-completion.  I have the following command in my code~/.inputrc/code file so that auto-complete is case insensitive.  precodeset completion-ignore-case on /code/pre  You can then, depending on how it is configured, tab complete folders and files and double tab to list available options when there is more than one match.   To quickly open a folder in finder using this approach  ul liUse a quick way to open the terminal (e.g., using Alfred, or Spotlight, etc.)/li liNavigate to the folder using tab completion/li liEnter codeopen ./code to open the working directory in Finder/li /ul  <answer71404>    for example: H:\folder\phot   h1With Finder/h1  As you like the arrow key approach with Windows, you might like arrow keys with OS X.   To reach, for example, codeMacintosh HD/Applications/Contacts/code:  ol likbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdC/kbd/li likbdCommand/kbd-kbd3/kbd/li likbdm/kbdkbda/kbd/li likbd→/kbd/li likbda/kbdkbdp/kbd/li likbd→/kbd/li likbdc/kbdkbdo/kbd/li /ol  Much shorter approaches are possible but if you like arrow keys, then generally: kbdCommand/kbd-kbd3/kbd is your friend.   <comment82439> Thanks! I use the terminal for almost all my navigation, but I didn't know about the case-insensitive option. <comment83076> Have you tried [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com)? At the risk of regurgitating [prior gushing](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/86/12625), this "old" app should handle what you're asking with even less typing than Windows.
