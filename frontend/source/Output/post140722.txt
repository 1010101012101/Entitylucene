Screen Sharing: PPC G5's Screen Becomes Unusably Bizarre After Login <body> I have a PPC G5 running Tiger that I access headlessly via Screen Sharing on my Late 2012 Mac Mini Server [Mt. Lion]. This worked without incident for over a year. Both computers are connected to my Airport Extreme with ethernet cables.  After a loudly whirling fan event, the G5 is no longer usable via Screen Sharing because the screen image is just totally jacked up.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKXNZ.png" alt="G5 Screen while Screen Sharing After Login"  The G5 functions normally, with a perfectly normal screen, up until login is processed and, also, appears perfectly normal when directly attached to a monitor. I am able to make out traces of drop down menus opening through the grey/brown streaks and stripes when I move the pointer from my trackpad around (the G5 is connected via Bluetooth with a dongle). The desktop image is a relatively low res, sepia toned photo. The pointer is not affected by the horizontally striped blur that is affecting the rest of the desktop, all menus, etc.  Screen Sharing from my Mini to my also older MacBook [Leopard] continues to work without incident. Attempting to Screen Share the G5 from the MacBook produces the same striped blur as appears when I use the Mini. Changing the Screen Sharing preferences has thus far produced no notable changes. I am unable to install TeamViewer on the G5 to see if that would also be afflicted with the issue because I can't see the screen to do so.   What is going on and how can I fix it? And why is the login screen unaffected?
