Can you do a Find and Replace all in the Pages App for iPad? <body> I'm using the pages app on my iPad and I have a large document. I need to rename term which is used many times.  I've found the find and replace functionality but it appears to only replace one term at a time. Doing one at a time could take hours, is there a way to Find and Replace All?  <answer137228> Here are the steps I took to Find and Replace a word with a word(s) in Pages app for iPad:  ul liTap in the toolbar and tap Find in the popover./li liWhen the search field appears at the bottom of the screen, type in the word(s) youâ€™re searching for. The results are immediately highlighted in the document. Use the forward and back arrows to move through the document to see the results in context./li liTo replace the found term, tap (gear) to the left of the search field./li liIn the popover, you can refine your search by searching for matching cases or whole words only.
