Shortcut for toggling between different windows of same app? <body> I opened two Google Chrome windows (because I am using multiple Gmails) and when I do the kbdCmd ⌘/kbd kbdTab ⇥/kbd shortcut it just shows me other applications that I opened but does not show me the other Chrome windows that are already opened.

To overcome this, use kbdCmd ⌘/kbdkbdTab/kbd as usual and on the icon of the application you want to switch windows in press the down arrow key (with kbdCmd ⌘/kbd still pressed). Then use left/right keys to navigate to the desired window across spaces and desktops.

In that case, you have to use Mission Control shortcuts, e.g.  kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd→/kbd and kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd←/kbd  <answer254494> I figured out why cmd + ` doesn't work half the time. Your applications can not be in full screen mode, which is kinda silly but I tried it on the Finder window like mentioned above, no problem. Took both chrome windows out of full screen and the shortcut works like a charm.   strongUPDATE/strong  The best I could come up with is pressing control + left or right on your keypad. It cycles through all your full screen windows, but hey at least it's something.  Also North American keyboard settings, though I don't think that actually matters since the issue, assuming at least, is the app was fullscreen.   <answer260103> command + number works for me, just make sure that your caps lock is not "on".

Might need someone with the same language to find it… they move around. <comment231258> To ensure you're trying to use the correct shortcut, switch to a Finder window, then look at the Window menu. The shortcut should be listed beside "Cycle Through Windows"--a menu option that doesn't appear in other applications, for some reason. The Apple docs do sometimes list the shortcut as Cmd-~ rather than Cmd-` (which are both on the same key on my UK keyboard, but '~' requires the Shift key), so it may vary between keyboard layouts. <comment231263> OK..I got it because the two chrome windows are in different desktop space it is not cycling through the windows..Do you know how to open the next chrome window in the same desktop space? <comment231266> You'd need to set up key commands for Spaces to do that - see system prefs  keyboard  shortcuts  mission control [key commands are added as you add Spaces, but are not enabled by default] <comment286872> You need to add what nationality keyboard & OS that works on. This is yet another of those 'changes by language' settings. <comment319256> Finally answer that explain where, what and how.. In my case finder was showing in window menu that shortcut is ⌘ + `, but in System Preferences under "Move focus to next window" it is ⌘ + , which actually works when I tried.

What the hell is happening to the beloved Macintosh  consistency over the years? Command center really helps me wrangle many apps, window, app/windows, etc. but there's this annoying gap that should be *fundamental*. Related; my other fave rave is trying to get at collapsed (to the dock) windows. To be fair and balanced, Keyboard shortcuts (system preferences | keyboard) is killer awesome but needs actual menu items to "hang on."

I tested by moving mine from ` and ~ to § and ± <comment347230> Cmd [number] is for selecting individual tabs in a single window. <comment347231> You need to add what nationality keyboard & OS that works on. This is yet another of those 'changes by language' settings <comment347232> That would appear to be the US command, but on an International English keyboard. US keyboard doesn't have ± above Tab, & in fact doesn't have that key at all, anywhere on the keyboard. Can you check & confirm? See https://support.apple.com/HT201794 <comment347285> @Tetsujin: Even if you don't have the `±` key it would work with any key which is on above of tab. Just tried it with British PC keyboard layout which has `~` on top of Tab and it worked <comment347318> British doesn't have ~ on top of Tab, that's US. Did you check the link I posted above? British layout it's not the key above Tab that's used, which is why I find your answer misleading. <comment347319> oh...British PC... OK, but that's why we really need to know exactly which keyboard & layout, because this just gets more confusing otherwise... & it doesn't really work well if the keyboard you selected is not the one you actually have. <comment352411> [I edited a Slovak keyboard into your answer to give us something to point at] It's usually one of the two highlighted key locations by default - even though different languages have different keys assigned there. Are you 100% certain neither of those keys worked as default? Could you highlight which Apple **did** intend to be used if that's not the case? <comment352413> I added a green highlight to what would appear to be the `\`` key, though that would be an unusual place for the command [based on how other languages seem to be] <comment352434> Thanks, but Slovenian (sLOVEnia) is not the same as Slovak (Slovakia). Two different countries with two different languages. ;) <comment352435> My apologies, I just searched 'slo' on the keyboards page & used the only hit. Apple doesn't list any Slovenian keyboard, so which keyboard & input language are you actually using? <comment352437> I can choose Slovenian keyboard on macOS Sierra: https://i.stack.imgur.com/AxZZo.png <comment352438> but does that match your physical keyboard? If so, is it an Apple keyboard? [which would make me wonder why it's not listed] <comment352439> This is how it looks like when i hold down the "alt" key. I will make a photo of my physical keyboard. <comment352442> @Tetsujin My "MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)" physical keyboard: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tGl7.jpg <comment356784> @Tetsujin: I guess there is no way to just change the shortcut from the \`+cmd+shift (switch to the previous window) but keeping the \`+cmd (switch to the next window) unchanged? i.e., to modify only one of them, because I find doing switches to either previous or next using my left with two fingers more comfortable. <comment356789> There's only one command available. The reverse will be that +Shift <comment356892> Same applies for a German keyboard. Only problem is if you minimise one of the instances than it won't pop up :/ <comment367261> You are right, MAC is cancerous in that regard... extremely annoying that one cannot easily switch between full-screened windows of the same app. I hope, they fix it soon :/ <comment370827> "To overcome this, press the down arrow key on the app you want to toggle between, and use left/right keys to navigate to the desired window across spaces and desktops." I'm trying to do this for Xcode...so I press arrow down and then hit left arrow?! I'm sure that not what you meant, but that's what I understand and doing so only moves cursor within the application. :/ Can clarify what you meant? <comment371074> @Honey - answer has been edited for better info. [I didn't get it either, someone else edited it in] <comment371086> @Tetsujin I understand now. Thanks.  So I switched to that app and and while holding `cmmd` I clicked up and down but nothing happened. It just scrolls down. I tried on Xcode/Chrome. They both scroll down and don't switch between windows <comment371088> Don't switch. Make the "streamer" of apps show the app you need, then [still holding Cmd] use  down arrow [then let go of Cmd] then left/right. It's very very clunky, but it does work. <comment371720> So I have to cycle through a ton of windows to get the one I want and then look for the second one I want. I want to kill myself everytime I do this.
