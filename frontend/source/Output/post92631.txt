Is there a way to hide some events from an Outlook calendar? <body> I have an Outlook calendar synced to my iPhone which has a lot of "reminders" that I don't really want to see on my actual calendar.  How can I hide emsome/em of these items from my iPhone, without deleting them entirely from Outlook?  <answer100020> You can move those items you don't want to view in your phone into a new 'reminders' calendar, then disable that in your phone, however this has the shortcoming that other staff in our org do not see the free/busy information of that 'reminders' calendar. If I could fix that problem this would work for me.  related question: https://superuser.com/questions/636605/how-do-i-share-free-busy-info-from-an-outlook-subcalendar  <comment108646> Isn't there an option to deselect (hide) calendars in the iCal app? <comment108647> Yes, I can enable and disable specific calendars.  But this is about specific items in a calendar; my work calendar. <comment108671> Make the Items PRIVATE  so it wont share! <comment108744> @Buscarì›ƒ - Setting a calendar item as private in Outlook does not prevent it from showing up in the iPhone's calendar.
