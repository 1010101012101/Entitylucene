It is important to note that it uses your phone as a "server" for your messages; whenever you open it after setting it up, it will need to connect to your phone in order to load and be able to send/receive messages. This is because it needs to load the messages from your phone, not WhatsApp's own servers, as messages are not stored on their servers.  <comment181556> Thank you but my phone is iPhone 5 and has iOS 8. Why should I install Android? <comment181573> @user1213807, I interpreted Zero's comment to mean that you can install WhatsApp on your mac, by installing the Android _version_ of WhatsApp on your Mac using BlueStacks, which must be some kind of Java/Android emulator service for OS X. <comment185990> Please summarize answers instead of just posting a link.

It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. Also, sending people off to Google isn't really helpful. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment268487> It is correct that whatsapp can run on mac using an emulator called bluestacks, the only thing is that you cannot have one account on pc/mac and smartphone simultaneously. You would constantly have to verify the change between your smartphone and computer by typing in a code send to your phone, which sometimes can take up to an hour or more. I have tried it and do not recommend it. But... whatsapp for your browser is in development!
