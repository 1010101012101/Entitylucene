Powerline Theme in OSX terminal have a strange color <body> I configure the powerline theme on OSX like codezsh/code codevim/code and codeemacs/code  But it has a strange colour in the "" character  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bfVH.png" alt="emacs config line"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JUZUO.png" alt="zsh config line"  How can I make the the "" character colour match with the powerline bar  <answer246502> There's not much you can do about it (except trying a different font).   I had the same "issue" but I don't consider this as something bad. Get use to it but first try a font that will match as much as possible and will reduce the difference between "rectangle" section and "triangle" section.  Check my OMZ shell script where I use bullet-train theme.     Bullet Train theme for OMZ requires Powerline Compatible Fonts   Take a look especially at:  precodemkdir $TEMP_FONT_DEST cd $TEMP_FONT_DEST git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git . ./install.sh rm -rf $TEMP_FONT_DEST /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C73mg.png" alt="enter image description here"  I will upvote your question because you're new here and to wake up your creativity. Good luck with customising your shell.  <comment304023> So the problem you are asking about that it has cyan background when in `/bin` directory? Or that the colour of the triangle does not match the line? <comment304025> @techraf the second '/bin' directory is my selection. The color of triangle is different from the front bar
