Problems Installing Windows on a late 2011 Macbook <body> I followed the steps in this question for installing Bootcamp Windows 8.1.    When I restarted, nothing came up. I booted it from the disk it made on my Macbook and when it started it just shows "Insert Boot Media".  Can someone help me troubleshoot?  <comment341043> Did you follow all the steps for troubleshooting on that question?  There's comments there from people who couldn't get it to work. <comment341366> Yes I did, it boots up but then asks for me to insert bootable media, I dont have a disk so it wont let me get past that screen
