Trimforce on third party SSD disables keyboard and touchpad <body> ul liSpecs: MBP 15" Mid 2010 i7 8gb ram /li liSSD: Sandisk PLUS 240GB SATA3/li liOS: macOS Sierra 10.12.1/li /ul  Brand new SSD. Fresh install of macOS Sierra with the latest update 10.12.1.  When using codesudo trimforce enable/code it enables successfully and reboots the machine. After the reboot during the first 20-30 seconds built-in keyboard and trackpad stop responding and they never recover back. The only fix is to disable trim: codesudo trimforce disable/code.   When trim is disabled everything works absolutely fine - no issues with keyboard nor trackpad.  What could cause such behaviour?   <answer263921> a. Trim is not really necessary on modern SSD's. GarbageCollection works pefectly fast when there is enough free space, say 20% or more. b. Do not use Trim when the SSD has not a modern Marvel controller (never install trim on a SSD with Sandforce controller. The new Sandisk SSDs have a Marvel controller, I do not know what controller is in the Sandisk Plus.  <comment330740> Why would then TRIM be enabled on the new 2016 original Apple SSD's?
