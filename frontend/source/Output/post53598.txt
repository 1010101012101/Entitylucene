Can the formula bar font in Excel 2011 be changed? <body> Is it possible to change the font, specifically the size of the font, in the formula bar of Excel 2011?  I've found a number of resources to do this in the Windows version but none of those instructions seem to apply to the Mac version...  <answer85075> http://www.excelforum.com/excel-general/837994-formula-bar-text-size.html  Seems like "no" for 2011.  Grr.. very frustrating!  <comment97980> Welcome to AD, and thank you for your answer. Would you be willing to summarize the information found at the link you provided?
