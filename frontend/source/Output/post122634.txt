How to switch from Spotlight to Alfred via Terminal? <body> I installed Alfred through homebrew-cask. I want to disable Spotlight and let Alfred be opened with Cmd+S.  The first Terminal-based solution I tried was unloading Spotlight with codesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist/code. However, this makes homebrew fail with "couldn't get the client port", and it's known.  The second one was to change Spotlight shortcut by accessing System Preferences - Spotlight and disabling the option "Spotlight menu keyboard shortcut". It worked.  What I still don't like is that this solution isn't portable, and I can't add that to my dotfiles. Also, Spotlight still runs, but I think I will have to deal with it because I need homebrew to work.  <answer186065> Alfred requires Spotlight to function properly.     Alfred relies on the same OS X metadata index as Spotlight. As such, it's important for you to let Spotlight run on your Mac to maintain an index of the files on it.   http://support.alfredapp.com/kb:spotlight  This answer to a similar question provides a shell command to stop Spotlight's emGUI only/em, which will disable Spotlight's shortcut.
