Mac OS X (10.9.2) Terminal: Getting Weird Characters ~$â <body> out of nowhere I am getting the following weird characters:  $â followed by a paragraph sign. See the below image for more detail:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A3AG1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also note where the white cursor is: it's basically 'one-off' so it's tough to tell where the cursor actually is, and becomes quite frustrating when typing.  I generally work with Ruby on Rails and have NOT added anything recently out of the ordinary. This just started happening out of the blue.  Any ideas?  <answer149059> Mark, you are 100% right! I have no idea how those characters got into my /.bash_profile, but they did! So I just went in there and removed them and now all is working correctly. Thanks again!  <comment175380> What does `echo $PS1` show? <comment175383> Could you check or change the User name ?
