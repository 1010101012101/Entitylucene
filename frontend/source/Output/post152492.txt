Font smoothing for pdf files in OSX Yosemite Safari vs Skim <body> I produce a lot of pdf files using LaTeX and thus, I also read a lot of such files. After the update to OS X 10.10 the fonts are not smooth anymore. However, Safari seems to handle it much better than Skim (see screenshot for comparison).   The option "Use LCD font smoothing when available" is enabled; without it, the texts are almost unreadable. Anyone has any clue how to make the font looking better?

I can confirm (with Pixie) the rendering is the same in Preview, Skim, and QuickLook, at least with subpixel rendering forced to 2.  <comment179607> This is happening with non-Retina displays in general (including mine). There's a [thread](http://sourceforge.net/p/skim-app/mailman/skim-app-users/thread/D9EC92CC-86CF-4D58-9718-53E8070291F1%40mac.com/) in the Skim users mailing list where the developer says that this is a PDFKit bug and he can't do anything about it. <comment179726> Thanks dfan. Could you - Alex Pigeon - remove your edits, so that people can see the screenshots in full size? <comment179933> This issue has been confirmed as a bug and is a duplicate of [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151200/) and [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151995/) post.

We need to loudly shout about any bugs that disturb in the work, so that Apple knows where is the priority in solving them (for sure there are also many others).
