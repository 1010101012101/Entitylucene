I am unable to boot my mac in El Capitan and Single User mode <body> I am unable to boot El Capitan.  When I turn on the computer it seems to load fine for a while, but then this screen shows up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LJazi.jpg" /  When I try to boot into Single User mode, it stops loading at this point:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/itw6c.jpg" /  Then minutes later, this happens:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a8y9z.jpg" /  I've tried to repair the HD using Internet Recovery, the log says the partition seems fine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCEEH.jpg" /  I have also reset the PRAM several times.  The error I get when trying to boot into Single User mode seems pretty crazy. Is it likely that I'm gonna have to reinstall the OS?  <answer264302> Yes. Single user mode is the most basic thing your OS can do. If that fails, you either have a major hardware problem or the OS needs to be reinstalled.   Most people make a backup and then attempt a reinstall. If you can't reinstall the OS, that pins the problem on the hardware pretty squarely. If it works, you can safely assume the software just needed to be reinstalled.
