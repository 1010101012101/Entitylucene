What is the gray circle Finder shows next to a file, that is not a tag? <body> Today, I noticed a image I downloaded earlier (one of two) has a large gray circle at the right-hand edge of the Name column in Finder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ouXUx.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that the other image made at almost the same time doesn't have it.  strongThis is not a tag./strong When adding the gray tag to the file, it looks like this, with a second small gray circle.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TQJxl.png" alt="enter image description here"  The large gray circle is something different. What is it?  This is macOS Sierra, 10.12.4, on a 2013 model Macbook Pro. Last night, when the image was made, neither had a gray circle.  It's appeared sometime in the last 24 hours.  emEdit:/em the file is located in Downloads, and (edited from original) was actually a downloaded file from Chrome. I do not have iCloud sync enabled for files. The gray circle was not present last night or earlier today; in fact since I posted the question, the circle has disappeared, reappeared, and disappeared again - only for this file and no others.  <answer283170> Is the file located in code~/Documents/code or code~/Desktop/code and do you have iCloud Drive turned on? If yes, this is the upload indicator saying the file is almost 100% uploaded. But sometimes it can freeze. Maybe the last Bit has not been uploaded or you just have to reboot your system to make it disappear.  On the other hand, if this file is located in code~/Downloads/code then it is the download indicator. The issue is similar to the one above. It can be that the file was not fully downloaded.  <answer283198> Thanks for clarifying the question about the location and your OS.   In your case the grey dot is a progress indicator for a downloaded file. It used to be a horizontal bar, filling up as the download progresses. Now its a Circle filling up clockwise.   Sometimes the circle does not disapear, like in your case, indicating an incomplete Download.   IMO it is not directly an Application Problem, since i have seen this behaviour in Google Chrome as well as Opera and Safari. There was a report here on SE about this being a Bug in Chrome (see here) but in the comments you see other Users had had it happened in other Apps as well.  Since the File still opens it seems to be a finder refresh problem for wich are several solutions.   ul liThe easiest would be to wait (not clear how long) for it to disapear (like in your case)./li liTry restarting the app with which you downloaded the file, in your case Google Chrome/li liYou could try forcing a refresh of the finder window by changing the directory, f.e. by moving up- or downward a level or closing and reopening the finder window. /li liYou could logout of your profile an login again (a bit too much IMO)/li lithere is a similar problem with the finder dock and recommendations are to kill the dock via a terminal command (again look here on SE in the comments). You could do something similar with the finder, but i would not recommend it/li /ul  I hope it clarifies this problem a bit.  <comment356975> It would help if you could specify which MacOS Version you are using. If f.e. you are using 10.12. and you have iCould Sync activated for Documents and Desktop, then the circle would be an indicator for an upload/synchronisation of that file with your iCloud Account. <comment356976> Hi JC: it's macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (at the very bottom of the question.)  I do not have iCloud Sync enabled for any files. I edited and added a bunch of other info I hope is useful :) <comment356977> Thanks @Marc. It is in Downloads, and I do not have iCloud Drive turned on, but a good guess :) <comment357036> Thanks! I think that must be it. Very odd bug - as I noted, the circle vanished, reappeared, and vanished again since I asked the question.
