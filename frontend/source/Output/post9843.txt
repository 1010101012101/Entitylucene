Is it possible to somehow default the OSX preview window size on open for PDF files? <body> I have had this bug-bare for a while where preview always opens documents too small, I'm visually impaired and want them to default to open with two options  ol liDefault width to nearly 100% of screen, last used would be perfect/li liDefault PDF display to "Single Page Continuous"/li liDefault the mouse tool to "Move"/li /ol  No matter what I do it always opens in a window 1/3 of my screen size to what I assume is "100%".  <answer10399> h3Customize Preview (easy)/h3  Have you looked under Preview preferences? You can set Initial Document Scale to 100% or larger if you want. You might need to adjust the option below that, defining size equal to screen or print sizes.  h3Use a better PDF viewer/h3  If Preview.app can't do what you want, look into Skim.app  Skim has an option to open PDFs as Default, Maximized, or Fit. One of these ought to improve.  h3Customize Preview (complex)/h3  If you want all three points requested above and want them in Preview.app, I would do the following:  ol liTurn on Universal Access so you can script applications via the GUI/li liMake a new app in Automator that accepts PDFs. Replace Preview with this (open with this by default, put it in your dock so you can drag-and-drop onto it, etc.)/li liThe new app should simply take the input PDF and pass it to Preview, so it displays there/li liThe new app should then use Universal Access commands to  ol liMaximize the window/li liSet to "Single Continuous Page"/li liSelect the mouse tool you want./li /ol/li /ol  <comment11368> Thanks mankoff, great suggestions, for now I've set the "Use scale of" to 200%, this works okay, but it always starts on the left of my screen, I want it centre. I can't use "maximise" because I have tunnel vision and can't see maximised windows. I think I'll attempt the customise option to move the preview window. I like preview because it's fast and light weight. <comment181670> Hi, I know this has been pretty long time. But is there a way You can provide a more detailed procedure to do this? Thanks.
