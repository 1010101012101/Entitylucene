How do I close Chats tabs in Skype for Business for Mac? <body> On the Windows Skype for Business client, to the right of each tab there is an X that allows closing the tab so it no longer shows in the list.  I have not been able to find a way to close tabs in the Mac client, despite extensive searching.  (It is possible to re-use exiting tabs when continuing to talk to someone, but if they start a new conversation with you or switch to a different device, it creates a new tab.  After using the client for one day, I have 5 tabs from one co-worker. I'd like to make the old ones go away.)  OS X 10.11.6 / El Capitan and Skype for Business 16.0.3638  <answer260653> I found that clicking the tab once selects the tab and moves the cursor to the chat box. A second click on the tab selects the tab, then you can press the delete key to delete the tab.  <comment327118> That does it!  I had someone else tell me too, and was coming back to answer my own question.  Some very odd UI interactions in this app; not quite Mac-standard, but not exactly like the Windows version either.  Someday I'll figure out how to send an image... not worth cluttering here. <comment342281> Too bad, tabs are gone now with the latest public release :(
