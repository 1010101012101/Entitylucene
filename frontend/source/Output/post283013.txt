dnsmasq aborts on Sierra with trap 6 <body> I upgrade to Sierra, reinstalled Macports and have troubles with dnsmasq. This is strongnot/strong a problem of Macports version because I also tried to build from various official sources too and all of them produce the same error. Here is what happens if I call it manually:  precodesudo /opt/local/sbin/dnsmasq -d -C /opt/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.my dnsmasq: started, version 2.76 cachesize 150 dnsmasq: compile time options: IPv6 GNU-getopt no-DBus no-i18n no-IDN DHCP DHCPv6 no-Lua TFTP no-conntrack no-ipset auth no-DNSSEC loop-detect no-inotify dnsmasq: reading /etc/resolv.conf dnsmasq: using nameserver 192.168.0.1#53 Abort trap: 6 /code/pre  My configuration file worked fine in El Capitan. It has the following options enabled:  precodedomain-needed bogus-priv resolv-file=/opt/local/etc/resolv.dnsmasq address=/.dev/127.0.0.1 interface=lo0 no-dhcp-interface=lo0 bind-interfaces cache-size=150 /code/pre  The file em/opt/local/etc/resolv.dnsmasq/em exists and contains correct information:  codenameserver 192.168.0.1/code  Firewall is off.  System log contains entries like:     default    12:08:32.303776 +0300   dnsmasq detected buffer overflow   A new entry appears for each invocation of dnsmasq.  I can only conclude that something is changed in os x and stops dnsmasq from working. Does anybody have the idea what could have caused it?
