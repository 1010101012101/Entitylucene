I cant see my bootable 10.9.3 usb drive on mac <body> I downloaded 10.9.3 dmg file (aprox. 5gb) from torrent site. Than I installed trasmac to my other windows computer and created a bootable usb with it. But when I plug this usb to my mac I could not see my bootable usb in the first menu. just I see only one symbol after I start my macbook air late 2010 (with option key). I also tried to reinstall osx from the menu but an error occured like ''An error occured while preparing the installation. Try running this application agaian'' (I tried it more than 15 times) but it isn't working. My system was 10.9.2 before I erased it for clean format. I cant download mavericks from macbook because I dont have any other mac and as you know I cant open my macbook to download mavericks from mac appstore. Meanwhile I dont have time machine backup. Do you have any  suggestions? How can I solve this problem?  Also I can try to download and install 10.10 but will it work on my air 2010?  <comment181690> MacBooks Air released in 2010 will run Yosemite (10.10)
