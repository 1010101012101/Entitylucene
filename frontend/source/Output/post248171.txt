Apple TV, xfinity, and remote app <body> I have my 3rd gen Apple TV connected to an xfinity hotspot (that's the only wifi I have right now) and the remote app from my iPhone 6 Plus S isn't finding it on the air play menu? They are both connected to the same xfinity hotspot. I can mirror air play but my remote app just won't find my Apple TV. I tried three different apps too and none of them are working. Some help would be best appreciated. Thanks  <answer248177> Although I can't say for sure, my "gut feeling" is that this is a firewall issue - your router could be blocking ports 3689 and/or 5353.

Generally, you configure a router by entering its IP address into a web browser. You can find the address in System Preferences, as described at http://osxdaily.com/2011/10/05/find-router-ip-address-mac/ <comment306427> What do I do when I have the IP address? The hotspot that I'm using is a public hotspot through XFINITY. <comment306429> You have a public hotspot in your home? I have never heard of anything like that. If there is some program like that, then you will need to contact whoever administers the network. If it's not really a public hotspot, you will need to look up the instructions for your specific router.
