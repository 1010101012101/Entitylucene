Apple ID Sign In <body> This morning when I clicked on my iPhone 6 the screen showed several messages.  One of them was:     Apple Sign In Requested.  Your Apple ID is being used to sign in to a   device near Jinan, Shandong.   I have no idea what to do or if I've been hacked or not. Can someone explain what this means and can I log onto my iPhone and iPad?  I am typing this on a Desktop computer as I am afraid to open my iPhone.  <answer249673> You can login into your account and check the devices which all are connected with your apple id , from that if you find anything strange you may please remove that device from the list. Then change your password of apple credentials. Use this link for more reference and login.
