How do I always stop the next podcast from auto playing when the current one finishes? <body> How do I permanently disable the Podcast app auto playing the next unplayed podcast episode when the current one finishes? It even plays episodes of other podcasts, not just the podcast I was listening to.  The only way I'm aware of is to set the sleep timer to "When Current Episode Ends", but this only applies to the currently playing podcast. I'd have to remember to set this option every single time I start a podcast playing which I don't want to have to do.  I'm using an iPhone 6 with iOS 9.2 and Podcasts version 2.3.  <answer219616> This is currently not possible.
