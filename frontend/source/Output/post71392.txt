Apple's Notes forgetting notes -- why? <body> I started to use the default Notes app over iPhone, iPad and Macbook. After it sends me an email about the note, the note gets removed. I want to keep the notes. My friend suspected a time-drift bug in Apple but I checked and the devices are in the same time. It is very hard to believe this is an intentional feature. I use sync over iCloud. I have OS X 10.7.5, iPhone 4S and iPad 2.   strongHow can I get notes unremoved?/strong  <comment82912> What the app forgets for me is its window position and whether the folder pane is open or closed. OS X 10.8.2. <comment82919> How are you using Notes.app on OS X 10.7? <comment82921> Ah, right. No, there's no standalone Notes.app for 10.7, you can only use it through Mail.app. <comment82926> Could you edit and tag this if you are syncing notes as part of a third party email service or over iCloud? Both are possible so it's likely this is part of the issue.
