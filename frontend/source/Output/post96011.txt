How can I install an application from a .pkg without admin password? <body> I'm trying to install the "Unity Web Player" so that I can play this game I've been waiting for for a while. The installer is a .pkg package installer which I can't use because I do not have admin access (long story). Is there a way to get the application out of the package and install it manually in my own folders?  <answer96023> You might be able to extract the main .app file from the .pkg using "Pacifist", downloaded from http://www.charlessoft.com/  Depending on what system settings are updated (or, if any global libraries or frameworks are installed) by the installer, this process may or may not work completely.  <comment112714> Sorry, back to the Admin, did you try to regain it ?
