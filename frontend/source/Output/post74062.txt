Using SSH-LPR with Mac? <body> I'm looking for a way to add a printer to my MacBook that prints using the codelpr/code command on a remote server. I have passwordless logins set up, and I found a script that appears to do what I need it to: SSH-LPR Backend for CUPS. The only problem is setting it up.  I figured out that on Mac, code/usr/lib/cups/backend/code is actually code/usr/libexec/cups/backend/code, and I added, and codechmod/code'd the sshlpr script to that folder.  Then I went to codehttp://localhost:631//code after codecupsctl WebInterface=yes/code, but I don't see an option to add an SSH-LPR printer.  What do I do next?  <answer74078> I figured it out eventually. Turns out all I needed to do was restart the CUPS daemon. A simple codekillall cupsd/code followed by refreshing the web interface did the trick.  I got the option to add an "LPR through SSH" printer, and it shows up Print &amp; Scan as well as my applications.
