How to set proxy configuration file in command line? <body> Sometimes I need to use ShadowsocksX to bypass GFW, but ShadowsocksX will clear my proxy configuration file.  When I come to my company, I've to set proxy configuration file manually, I'm wondering if there any OSX's command can help me to set  proxy configuration file? So that I can create an alias in my zshrc file.  <answer166443> codenetworksetup/code is a configuration tool for network settings in System Preferences. event I don't really known what the ShadowsocksX project is, but I decided this command can help up.  PS: if you just need to set the proxy for something like wget, or curl, then you can use the fairly universal 'http_proxy' and 'ftp_proxy' env variables. codeexport http_proxy=http://myproxy:port/code  <comment195233> Thanks, it's `networksetup -setautoproxyurl "Wi-Fi" "http://somedomain.com/proxy.pac"`
