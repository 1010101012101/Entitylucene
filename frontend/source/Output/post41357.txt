How can I make a soft link in Lion? <body> I realized today that an alias is not the same thing as a soft link in Lion. I made an alias of a folder in my Dropbox folder and moved the alias to my Desktop.  When I try to codecd/code into this alias in terminal, the terminal notes that the alias is not a folder. In Ubuntu, I can, however, codecd/code into a soft link.  How can I create a soft link in Lion? It would be convenient for me because I write python scripts that rely on soft links.  <answer41360> You must use the Unix codeln/code command from Terminal.  precodeln -s existingname newname /code/pre  <answer41361> You can create soft links (a.k.a. symbolic links or symlinks) from the terminal, the same way as in any other Unix system.  I'm not familiar with Dropbox so I'll make up an example assuming that there is a folder codeDropbox/code in your home directory:  precodecd ~ ln -s ~/Dropbox/aFolder Desktop/aFolder /code/pre  Note that codeln/code takes the link to create as its emsecond/em argument; think of it like codecp/code.  Also, a warning: if you create a soft link with a emrelative/em path, for example  precodecd ~/Desktop ln -s ../Dropbox/aFolder aFolder /code/pre  then the link will be relative to emits location at the moment/em, not to the current directory when you created it! So, for example, if you moved it into code~/Desktop/Folders/code then it would be pointing at code~/Desktop/Dropbox/code instead of code~/Dropbox/code.
