How does /etc/hosts or /private/etc/hosts work on 10.11? <body> I've been trying to test my knowledge of what code/etc/hosts/code is but I'm not getting anywhere. From understanding the point of code/etc/hosts/code is it can round host names to ip addresses. So if you put the following in your code/etc/hosts/code file:  precode127.0.0.1:3000 foo /code/pre  then a codecurl foo/code should send a GET request to the local host on port 3000.  However there is a wrinkle, because aparently on OSX 10.11.6 it doesn't use code/etc/hosts/code instead it uses code/private/etc/hosts/code, so then adding the above line to that file should work. But it doesn't because there is a further wrinkle, you have to reset the DNS cache, which according to this site can be done with the following command: codesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder/code. Am I missing something here?  When I curl localhost:3000 I get the rails hello world blog (because I have the default rails hello world blog running)  precode➜ curl localhost:3000 . . . &lt;strong&gt;Rails version:&lt;/strong&gt; 5.0.0.1&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ruby version:&lt;/strong&gt; 2.3.1 (x86_64-darwin15) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; ➜ /code/pre  however when I try to curl the custom domain name it doesn't work:  precode➜ sudo vim /private/etc/hosts ➜ sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder ➜ cat /private/etc/hosts ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1   localhost 127.0.0.1:3000 foo 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost ➜ curl foo curl: (6) Could not resolve host: foo /code/pre  What am I doing wrong here?  Thanks :)  <answer253852> The code/etc/hosts/code file on UNIX systems is for local DNS resolving.  As such, it doesn't take into account ports - it links hostnames with IP addresses, like the Domain Name Service.  Adding the following line:  code127.0.0.1 foo/code  to your code/etc/hosts/code file tells the internal DNS responder to send requests for codefoo/code to code127.0.0.1/code.   It will allow you to do the following:  code# curl foo:3000/code
