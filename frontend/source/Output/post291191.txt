Take fonts from Safari an use them throughout my Mac <body> First off, I’m using OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6 and Safari Version 10.1.1.    This website confirms that I “have a Unicode BASIC EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHS font installed” and that my version of Safari “correctly recognizes that font” (which I believe to be the Noto Sans Egyptian Hieroglyphs font by Monotype).    However, when I try to view these Unicode characters in my Emoji &amp; Symbols viewer, I cannot see any of them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/26NA2.png" alt="Hieroglyphs screenshot"  I believe (but I could be wrong) that I could download a font from Google Noto Fonts and use it throughout my interface and built-in apps.    Nevertheless, strongis there a way that I could access whatever font software Safari is using and apply that elsewhere?/strong  <comment367653> They are invisible in the character viewer! Really! Proof: copy one character and paste it into a TextEdit window... <comment367654> @klanomath There really isn't a need for being condescending; I provided the screenshot, and as you can see, they don't show up. If you would like extend your knowledge past the comments section, I would appreciate if you posted an answer that explains how I could view the characters *within* the character viewer—*without* the mean tone. <comment367656> It's probably a bug. But simply download [NotoSansEgyptianHieroglyphs-unhinted (direct d/l link!)](https://noto-website.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/NotoSansEgyptianHieroglyphs-unhinted.zip), unzip the file and double-click the ttf to import it to your user's Fonts folder. The glyphs are visible in the character viewer afterwards. <comment367657> @klanomath Thank you very much. I will try that now. <comment367659> @klanomath Perfection. If you post that as an answer I would love to mark it as correct for you.
