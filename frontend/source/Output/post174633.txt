Which Apple Developer program Should I enroll to create Passbook passes <body> I am reading this documentation: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Chapters/YourFirst.html  In order to register a pass type identifier, I need to be an Apple developer. My pass will be available on a web page (not an iOS app).  Which of the developer programs should I enroll to: iOS/Mac/Safari?  <answer174634> You need to enroll in the iOS developer program since Pass Type Identifiers are not available to Mac developers and no identifiers are available to Safari developers.  <comment205639> Thanks! While I am waiting to get approved, I am still wondering how come it doesn't say this on any documentation :) <comment205640> @Galz I don't know. When you get approved, file a bug report about that. Generally Apple responds. Not fast, I had a bug I opened last year and got fixed last week.
