Cmd+Tab breaks "Assign To This Desktop" <body> Running Mavericks (recently upgraded from Snow Leopard) I have three apps open on three of my 5 desktops -- Safari on desktop 1, TextEdit on 2, and Calendar on 3.  I right-click on each icon in the dock on their respective desktops, and check codeAssign To/code codeThis Desktop/code.  I can right-click again any number of times to verify that that option is indeed checked.  I can codeCmd+right/code and codeCmd+left/code across them, or codeCmd+&lt;number&gt;/code to jump to the numbered desktop, and everything works fine.  In particular, the apps stay where they're supposed to.  But now I try to use codeCmd+Tab/code to switch apps and the desktop choice gets changed.  Using the example above, if I'm on desktop 3 looking at Calendar, and codeCmd+Tab/code to Safari (which should be on desktop 1), Safari gets pulled over to desktop 2, while TextEdit gets pushed to desktop 1 (and I get taken to desktop 2).  The same sort of behavior happens with more apps and more desktops.  Basically, the desktops get shuffled so that the codeCmd+Tab/code app is closest.  I have no extra monitor or anything else unusual that I can think might be screwing anything up.  Is there any way to permanently assign an app to a particular desktop and/or turn off this terrible shuffling behavior?  <answer120134> The apps are not being moved to different desktops, but the desktops are being rearranged. To see the difference, put two apps on a space, then Cmd-Tab to one of the apps.  You will end up in a space that contains both apps, although the space will have been renamed and shuffled in the order.  To stop this,   ol liOpen System Preferences/li liGo into Mission Control/li liUncheck Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdIh4.png" alt="Mission Control with Automatically rearranges Spaces based on most recent use"  <comment140136> Ah.  I wondered what that option meant.  Thanks!
