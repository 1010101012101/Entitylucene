SMB3 support on Mavericks <body> Does anyone know if Mavericks supports SMB3? My work server uses it, and it's been buggy as hell and never keeps connected. If it keeps connected I lose write permissions to files I'm working on. Hoping if I use the SMB1 protocal codecifs:///code  Link about it here:  http://www.tuaw.com/2013/10/27/did-mavericks-kill-your-network-drive-access-heres-a-fix/  Hope this helps someone out too with this issue. Thanks  <answer142056> Mavericks just introduced support for SMB2.  http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#core  SMB3 is a planned feature of the next version of OS X, Yosemite.  <answer144598> To further this: The SMB2 support in OS X 10.9 is rather buggy. It occasionally completely locks up requiring restart. At work, we've enforced SMB1 only, which can be done either by connecting with the cifs:// protocol, but since this can be hard to enforce for non-technical users, you can also write a preference file to either code~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf/code for a user preference or code/etc/nsmb.conf/code for a system wide preference.  Put in either of those files the content:  precode[default] smb_neg=smb1_only /code/pre  And reboot. Then all connections regardless of protocol prefix, will use the SMB1 implementation.  <comment170420> Thanks. We just decided to implement Time Machine into our server. :)
