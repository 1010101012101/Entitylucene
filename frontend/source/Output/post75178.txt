How can you see the value of a cookie on an iPhone? <body> I need to see the emvalue/em of a cookie in Safari on an iPhone.  How do I do this?  Note that I'm not asking how to delete a cookie, or how to see that a cookie exists.  I'm trying to see the actual data stored in a cookie.  For example, on Firefox, I can go to codeTools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy &gt; Show Cookies/code and see the actual data stored in each cookie my browser has stored.  <answer75186> You can't see cookie data on the phone itself, but if you activate codeSettings &gt; Safari &gt; Advanced &gt; Web Inspector/code you can connect the iPhone to an Apple computer with a cable and open Safari. Activate the Develop menu in codePreferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Show Develop menu in menu bar/code  Now you can open a page on the iPhone and then select codeDevelop &gt; your_phone &gt; the_page/code on the computer to see an inspector for the page on the phone. The second icon at the top is for storage and will show cookies for the page you show on the phone.  Sadly I can't find a way to show all cookies on the phone but if it is for development it is possible to monitor the cookie data.  <answer90336> type the following in your iPhone browser address bar and hit GO  precodejavascript:alert(document.cookie) /code/pre  <answer114749> The javascript:alert(document.cookie) only shows the site url on safari on ios 6.1.2 on iphone 4S.  Maybe it's due to the fact that it's an https site ?  <answer144795> You can open the same site in Safari on a Mac and use the web inspector to check for the cookie values.  <comment87305> What if you don't have an Apple computer? <comment87306> I'm unsure if this works on Windows but you can give it a try. I would have done that but not owning a windows computer. <comment134402> This does not provide an answer to the question.

You might need another tool or have to run one of the supported OS in emulation if you want to use this method. <comment231166> Want to inspect cookies on your iPad? "There's a MAC for that"
