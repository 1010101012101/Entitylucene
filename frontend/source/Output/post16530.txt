Umount Gamepad under Mac OS X <body> I can plug in my gamepad controller and usb probe shows me, that it is recognized. I want to umount it, so that I can use it under the Virtualbox. Where does Mac mount USB devices such as a gamepad.  Here is a picture of the usb probe output:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K57go.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Thanks for your help!  <comment18062> You should be able to configure VB to share USB devices. Is that not working? <comment18073> Hi Nathan, I installed some updates today and now its working. But still I do not know where it is mounted under Mac (in Ubuntu I can look under /dev/input to see, if its mounted).
