Can I upgrade from iPhone 4 w/ iOS7 to iPhone SE and iTunes restore? <body> Can I upgrade from iPhone 4 running old iOS7 to iPhone SE running iOS 9 and use iTunes backup restore functionality so that I don't have to reinstall everything?  <answer234456> Yes. You can always restore from and older to a newer iOS version, however you can't go from a newer iOS version and restore to an older version.  <comment286660> What is your computer's OS version?  iOS 9 requires a version of iTunes which does not work with older OSes. <comment286731> AFAIK everything is latest.
