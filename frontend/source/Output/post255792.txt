OSX 10.12 weird default browser popups <body> I have been getting now really weird popups suddenly opening in default browser (safari), they are game advertisement, some virus check, your browser is infected with safari logo etc...  Popups open randomly like between 5, 15, 30min or so...  I have ran malware bytes to check if it could find but no luck, nothing found.  What else I can do?  <comment318776> I'm assuming these popups come from different sites and not the same site?  Do you have [popups blocked](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21485?locale=en_US)?
