Mac Lion Prevent restart after a new software install or uninstall <body> Sometimes, Mac requires a restart after installing or uninstalling an application. What are the steps to prevent complete restart cycle and still achieve the desired result?  I remember I used to do a soft restart in terminal but now forgot the steps. After soft restart, the "uptime" command in terminal used to continue from previous uptime value, like "up 20 days".  <answer103975> You can install updates without restarting by running codesudo softwareupdate -i -a/code. It might cause some issues though. When I installed the 10.8.3 update without restarting, Safari started crashing on launch until I restarted the Mac.  If an installer or uninstaller forces you to restart, you can often just press command-Q to quit the installer.  I haven't heard of anything like a soft restart. You can quit all applications by running codesudo killall loginwindow/code, but it doesn't have the same effect as restarting or logging out and back in.
