Missing disk space after repartitioning <body> I tried to make a partition and then tried to undo it. Now, I don't know how to get the missing disk space back.  As you can tell, I have 751.28 GB disk. Macintosh HD and Recovery HD have 557.4 GB. About 180 GB are missing. Where did it go? How do I figure out where it went? Most importantly, how do I fix it?  I ran      precodediskutil list /code/pre  and it showed  precode    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *751.3 GB disk0     1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1     2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            556.7 GB   disk0s2     3:                 Apple_Boot                         650.0 MB   disk0s3     4:                 Linux Swap                         16.4 GB    disk0s4 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vBIhb.png" alt="enter image description here"  Edit:  I ran  precode   sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 /code/pre  Output is:   precode     start        size  index  contents          0           1         PMBR          1           1         Pri GPT header          2          32         Pri GPT table         34           6                  40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B     409640  1087392760      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 1087802400     1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 1089071936   344263872          1433335808    32049152      4  GPT part - 0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F 1465384960     1954819          1467339779          32         Sec GPT table 1467339811           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  <answer224715> First of all i would use a gparted livecd/usbstick to find and destroy the missing partition, after deleting the misscreated partition i would left the space unformatted. Since you are using El Capitan the system is probably using core storage it is preferable to resize the Macintosh HD volume with diskutil from your mac recovery partition or a Mac OS X installation usb stick . Using the terminal run   precodediskutil cs resizeStack /dev/disk0s2 736G /code/pre  *dont forget to modify the disk identifier an the volume size accordingly to your setup.  If the volume is not core storage i would still use gparted live to destroy the faulty partition and use one of the those options   ul liDirectly grow the mac Macintosh HD using gparted /li liBoot on the recovery partition and resize the Macintosh HD using disk utility/li /ul  <answer224718> Booted to Internet Recovery Mode you have to remove the swap partition and then resize your main volume.  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liBackup your main volume/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.   The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan). If you boot to a full system and login as admin you have to prepend codesudo/code to execute some commands like codegpt .../code or codenewfs_hfs .../code!/li /ul  strongRemove the Linux Swap partition/strong  ul liOpen in the menubar Utlities-Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil list/code and codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code to get an overview/li liRemove the Linux partition:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0  /code/pre/li /ul  strongRestore the original size of your main volume/strong  ul liResize your main volume:  precodediskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 750g #or 100% /code/pre  this should also move your Recovery HD to the end of the disk./li liverify the volume with codediskutil verifyVolume disk0s2/code/li lireboot to your main disk/li /ul  <comment272532> Thanks. But what does "dont forget to modify the disk identifier an the volume size accordingly to your setup" mean? <comment272534> Using the informations from the screenshot the volume to be resized would be /dev/disk0s2 but that does not mean it is going to be the same when booting from a other drive it could be disk3s2 or something else you can find the right one with diskutil list as for the space it is Macintosh HD + free space . i belive that if you are not setting any size  is going to fill the free space <comment272535> This will definitely not work because it's no corestorage volume
