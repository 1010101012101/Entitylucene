How do I confirm that my Mac has hibernated? <body> I believe I've correctly configured my MacBook Pro to hibernate (after a delay) when I close the lid, with the following settings  precode standbydelay         900  standby              1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  powernap             0  disksleep            0  sleep                1  autopoweroffdelay    28800  hibernatemode        25  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        0  displaysleep         2  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  However I'm not sure that my machine is actually hibernating as expected and would like to be able to confirm that it has.   Is there a way to do this?  I've tried things like  precodepmset -g log|grep -e " Sleep  " -e " Wake  "  -e " DarkWake " | tail -n 5 /code/pre  which gives, for example  precode2016-11-17 08:39:03 -0500 Wake                  Wake from Standby [CDNVA] due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using BATT (Charge:93%) 1630 secs  2016-11-17 09:06:13 -0500 Sleep                 Entering Sleep state due to 'Idle Sleep': Using Batt (Charge:83%) 868 secs   2016-11-17 09:20:41 -0500 Wake                  Wake from Standby [CDNVA] due to EC.PME/User: Using BATT (Charge:83%) 462 secs   2016-11-17 09:28:23 -0500 Sleep                 Entering Sleep state due to 'Clamshell Sleep': Using Batt (Charge:80%) 4586 secs  2016-11-17 10:44:49 -0500 Wake                  Wake from Standby [CDNVA] due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using BATT (Charge:79%) /code/pre  and  precodepmset -g log | grep LidOpen | tail -n 5 /code/pre  which gives  precode2016-11-16 18:10:07 -0500 Wake                  Wake from Deep Idle [CDNVA] due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using AC (Charge:35%) 95 secs    2016-11-16 18:27:04 -0500 Wake                  Wake from Deep Idle [CDNVA] due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using AC (Charge:53%) 675 secs   2016-11-17 07:50:59 -0500 Wake                  Wake from Deep Idle [CDNVA] due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using AC (Charge:100%) 174 secs   2016-11-17 08:39:03 -0500 Wake                  Wake from Standby [CDNVA] due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using BATT (Charge:93%) 1630 secs  2016-11-17 10:44:49 -0500 Wake                  Wake from Standby [CDNVA] due to EC.LidOpen/Lid Open: Using BATT (Charge:79%) /code/pre  or   precodepmset -g log | grep sleep | tail -n 5 /code/pre  which gives  precode2016-11-17 09:28:10 -0500 Assertions            PID 198(coreaudiod) Released PreventUserIdleSystemSleep "com.apple.audio.context2626.preventuseridlesleep" 00:01:46  id:0x0x1000087fe [System: DeclUser SRPrevSleep kCPU kDisp]           2016-11-17 10:44:24 -0500 Assertions            Kernel Idle sleep preventers: IODisplayWrangler           2016-11-17 10:54:12 -0500 Assertions            PID 198(coreaudiod) Released PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep "com.apple.audio.context2629.preventuseridledisplaysleep" 00:09:04  id:0x0x500008862 [System: DeclUser kDisp]           2016-11-17 10:54:12 -0500 Assertions            PID 198(coreaudiod) Released PreventUserIdleSystemSleep "com.apple.audio.context2629.preventuseridlesleep" 00:09:04  id:0x0x100008861 [System: DeclUser kDisp]           Idle sleep preventers: IODisplayWrangler /code/pre  but I'm not sure any of these are the right commands, or how to interpret their results.  How do I confirm (ideally from the command line) that my Mac has hibernated?
