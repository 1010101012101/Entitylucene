iPhone 7 change battery overheated? <body> I bought few months ago the new iPhone 7 and it has already some problems with battery especially when I use the headphones with bluetooth (the airpods) and the battery is overheated due to airpods. Is it a problem with this headphones or maybe the last updating of the system has a problem? I don't want to change my Iphone 7.
