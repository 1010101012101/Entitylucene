From where to download xcode 5? <body> I am using xcode 4.6.3. and now i want to download xcode 5.  But i dont want to download it from itunes / mac store or apple developer site.  So what are the other sources to download the xcode 5 ?  Please provide me links for this..  Thanks.  <answer104526> XCode 5 can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for free. This of course requires an Apple ID but this can be set up in a few minutes in case you don't have one yet.  <answer104527> You don't need to 'configure iTunes' to download software or use the Mac App Store, but those are the official download channels.  If you really need to use a straight HTTP style download then you can get previous versions through being a registered developer https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?q=xcode which might help, the most recent version available at the time of this post is V5 (September 18) which you can pull down in code.DMG/code form.  Note that this is the free membership program, not the $99/year Mac Developer Program.  See more here https://developer.apple.com/xcode/  <answer104529> Xcode 5 can be downloaded only from the Mac App Store or from the Apple Developer site.   You could create an Apple ID and use the Mac App Store to download it.    OR    ul liYou could create a free developer account at the Apple Developer portal/li ligo to the downloads section/li licheck only strongDeveloper Tools/strong under Categories on the left (uncheck others, to make it simpler to find)/li lithen download the Xcode 5 DMG file./li /ul  <comment122979> Any specific reason why you cannot download using MAS or the Apple Developer site? Are you using a Mac at all? <comment122981> @MK yes i am using mac. And i have not configured itunes so i couldnt be able to download xcode. so i need other source to download it <comment122983> Well, you have left out all legal ways of getting it in your question - you can get Xcode 5 only from MAS or from the Apple Developer site using a browser. <comment122984> You don't need to 'configure iTunes' to download software or use the Mac App Store. <comment122993> and i have another doubt that will this new xcode 5 will overwrite my previous version of my xcode (i.e 4.6.3)? what if i need both as separate? <comment122994> But he still needs an Apple Account.
