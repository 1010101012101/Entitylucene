Import user name and password automatically with AppleScript or Unix Shell <body> I'm trying the Cloud Service tool: Egnyte Drive. But the process "SecurityAgent" will be activated and the administrator's name and password is required the first time when I try to launch Egnyte Drive. I wonder if there is a way to import the administrator's name and password automatically or any way to bypass to activate "SecurityAgent" and launch Egnyte Drive without user name and password. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Here is what I have tried:  1.  precodetell application "Egnyte Drive" to activate     delay 1         tell application "System Events" to tell process "SecurityAgent"         set value of text field 2 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window 1 to "password"         click button 2 of group 2 of window 1 end tell /code/pre  The above img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bttl9.png" alt="enter image description here"code is invoked from How to enter password for prompt windows using applescript  ol start="2" lido shell script "open -n /Applications/Egnyte\ Drive" user name "USERNAME" password "THEPASSWORD" with administrator privileges/li /ol  <answer260462> I have installed Egnyte Drive to test your script.  I have found out that you don't need to activate the application at all. Instead "SecurityAgent" is the only process that needs to be addressed:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SecurityAgent"     set value of text field 1 of window 1 to "user"     if exists (text field 2 of window 1) then         set value of text field 2 of window 1 to "password"     end if     click button "OK" of window 1 end tell /code/pre  Let me know if this works for you as well. I tested it with macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta.  <comment326137> Cool, it's the code I need. Thanks a lot, sir. Have a nice day.
