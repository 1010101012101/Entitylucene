Start app/command-line tool without internet/network access <body> Is there anything that can help me launch an app or command-line tool without internet or network access even when I'm connected to the internet? (so that I can use other apps with Internet, and block access for some apps) Like a firewall? Or something that intercepts the syscalls, something like maybe?  <answer227969> It seems that what you're looking for would be Little Snitch. You can find out more about it and download it here.  <comment277749> All applications and command line tools (e.g. TextEdit.app, `cp`) can start without Internet access. However, the github link seems to simulate the `--dry-run` option on `rsync`, but your question asks for "starting things while not connected to the Internet". You may wish to edit your question to make it a bit clearer. <comment277829> @perhapsmaybeharry Done.
