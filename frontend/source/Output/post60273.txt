What terminal commands are new or updated in Mountain Lion? <body> Where can I find a list of new or updated terminal commands or features for Mountain Lion?   Lacking any list, does anyone have a sugguestion on how to generate that list?  (some combination of ls &amp; diff)  <answer60280> AD user @patrix did a great AD blog post on new terminal commands in Mountain Lion. You can find it here: http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/07/interesting-new-unix-commandsbinaries-in-os-x-mountain-lion/  <answer60281> The answer is in the following post:  New Unix commands in ML  <comment69434> It might also be interesting to compare the man pages to search for new options. `defaults` has an `-app` flag for specifying an application name instead of a bundle identifier. I'm not sure if it was added in 10.8 or 10.7, but `open` has an `-F` flag that opens applications fresh or without restoring windows.
