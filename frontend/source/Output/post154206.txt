Consumer NAS supporting Spotlight search? <body> Is there a consumer-level NAS (e.g. making a NAS out of a Mac Mini is at the other end of the spectrum) that supports Spotlight search? That is, searching for the contents within files without needing to download the entire file from the NAS?  The last time I check this requires Netatalk 3.1 and Gnome Tracker to be installed on the NAS. Which consumer NAS that already have these services built-in and activated in their firmware?  I couldn't find any NAS products which advertises their codenetatalk/code version or directly say that they support Spotlight. Usually they just say Time Machine compatible and that's it.
