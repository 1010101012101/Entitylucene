External hard drive won't show up anywhere <body> After rebooting my Mac my external hard drive stopped showing up. It does not appear in Finder, Disk Utility or even System Profiler.   I checked that both USB ports work and are recognized by Profiler and Disk Utility and the drive boots and can access files perfectly when connected to another computer. I've also reset the SMC and the NVRAM, run first aid on both my computer's internal drive and the external drive (while plugged into another mac), and ran a virus scan. What could be the problem?

You tried unplugging all other USB energy hogs? How about running the drive through a powered hub? <comment344014> @WayfaringStranger yes I've unplugged all other USBS and I don't have a powered hub to run it through unfortunately. But it still powers on when plugged into the usb port, it lights up and I can hear the disk moving inside <comment344015> @Nala If you can feel the drive spin too, that's likely not it then. <comment344147> Please issue the command `system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep "BSD Name" ` I want to see what USB disks are found under System Profiler. <comment344211> @alan It just returns "no such file or directory"
