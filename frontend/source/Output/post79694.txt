brew doctor get warning on opencv <body> i'm new to mac os x. i read that homebrew is a good packet manager and i have tried it.  i have also read that to install opencv 2.4 i have to follow those steps:  ul liinstall cmake via homebrew/li lidownload opencv/li licmake, sudo make/li /ul  and i have done it. now i have fully python wrapper in my mac os x. but now if i write codebrew doctor/code i have those warnings:  precodebrew doctor Warning: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig isn't writable. This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn't managed by Homebrew.  If a brew tries to write a .pc file to this directory, the install will fail during the link step.  You should probably `chown` /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig Warning: Unbrewed dylibs were found in /usr/local/lib. If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.  Unexpected dylibs:     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_calib3d.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_contrib.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_core.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_features2d.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_flann.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_gpu.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_highgui.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_imgproc.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_legacy.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_ml.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_nonfree.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_objdetect.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_photo.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_stitching.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_ts.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_video.2.4.2.dylib     /usr/local/lib/libopencv_videostab.2.4.2.dylib Warning: Unbrewed .pc files were found in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig. If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.  Unexpected .pc files:     /usr/local/lib  /pkgconfig/opencv.pc Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar Leaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause brews that depend on those kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:      git /code/pre  why?? what's wrong? what to do?  <answer80937> Homebrew's codedoctor/code command is very helpful. Since you installed OpenCV from source into the same directories that Homebrew is using, it's complaining about the unexpected files.  To solve the problem, just follow the instructions carefully. Homebrew tells you exactly what you need to do:  ul liMake the code/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/code directory writable./li liDelete the offending .dylib (code/usr/local/lib/libopencv_*.dylib/code) and .pc files (code/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc/code)./li liRun codebrew link git/code. (Not directly related to OpenCV.)/li /ul  <comment93244> Why didn't you use Homebrew to install OpenCV, instead of building it from source? Homebrew is confused because you bypassed it when you compiled and installed software into the same directories that it manages. <comment93280> ok, i did it wrong. how can i resolve it now?
