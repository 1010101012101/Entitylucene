Setting anacron on Mac - Shell Scripting <body> I set cron to run script every day using codeenv EDITOR=nano crontab -e/code where I wrote something like this code@daily path/to/sript.script/code.  Now I want to use emanacron/em to be sure that script is going to be run when I log in if I was logged off at the time when it was scheduled. But I am not sure where to specify that.  I tried something like codeenv EDITOR=nano anacron -e/code but that didn't work. Also, strange is that man anacron doesn't provide anything. I get this: "No manual entry for anacron"  <answer227308> OS X does not provide anacron.  <comment275983> `anacron` is not an installed utility in OS X.  Scheduled Tasks are handled by `launchd`, `cron` has been depreciated in OS X. You can also add an app/script to the User's Login Items too. <comment275986> What *exactly* are you trying to do?  At the time the script is supposed to run, is your computer powered on and you just logged off or is the computer powered off? <comment277418> Thank you for your answers guys. @Allan I want to be sure that script will run as soon as possible, even if I was logged off or my computer was powered off at the time the script is supposed to run
