Is there any way to translate words in Safari on iOS and Mac? <body> I am currently reading a few websites in European languages (Spanish, Italian, German and French), and I'd like to be able to quickly translate words that I don't know (not the entire articles, which is why I don't want to use Chrome's translation). I know there's a "define" feature, and it is nice, but it only gives definitions in the same languages as the word of interest, so it is not exactly useful for someone unfamiliar with the language.  So, maybe someone knows a feature or an extension similar to the "define" one, but that would allow me to quickly look up a translation for a word? I'm interested in solutions for both Mac OS X and iOS (latest versions). Maybe there are third-party Italian-, German-, and French-English dictionaries for Apple's "Dictionary" application?  <answer173994> For OS X you can add 3rd party dictionaries.  See  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2013/01/adding-dictionaries-to-dictionaryapp.html  Unfortunately it's not possible for iOS yet as far as I know.  <comment204816> I'm pretty sure iOS does include a Spanish/English translation dictionary.  But it's not yet possible to add dictionaries without jailbreaking.  There was once an app (Dictionary Append) which was supposed to do this, but it disappeared. <comment204817> Safari has its own (Bing) website translation feature.  http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-translate-websites-in-safari-on-ios-8/ <comment204822> @TomGewecke, thank you! I've heard about the Bing translation feature, but I'd prefer to be able to translate single words, which is what the "define" feature does :) Apparently, we'll have to wait until Apple provides us with more dictionaries.
