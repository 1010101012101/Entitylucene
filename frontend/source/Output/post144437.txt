Is there a way to edit bookmarks in Preview 7.0? <body> Since my "upgrade" to Mavericks, the ability to edit bookmarks in the "upgraded" Preview (version 7.0) app seems to have vanished.  Now, when creating a bookmark, I get a "quote" from the bookmarked page which may, or may not, have any relevance to what I'm trying to bookmark.  In prior versions of Preview, one could edit the bookmark name to something that was useful.  How can this be accomplished in the current version of Preview?  In the latest Version of Preview one cannot edit the bookmarks. It depends on the way you actually use Preview - but for me, this would be a serious deterioration. Reusing an older Preview.app that has this extremely useful feature does not work for me either. It just doesn't run on OS X 10.10.1.
