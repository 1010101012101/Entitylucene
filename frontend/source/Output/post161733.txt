Using iTunes navigation with lists. Is it gone now? <body> I was a big fan and heavy user of the list interface in previous iTunes. For example, it had the columns at the top, Genre, Artist, Album (i think :) ).  I was surprised in iTunes 12 that this feature is not found. This is a fundamental search-feature, where is it?  What am I missing? Is it done?  -Justin  <answer161805> Posted as answer just to provide imageâ€¦  As douggro says, the caret at top right of the window, when in Music view, gives you the old view back.  emPro Tip:/em if you also want the old view back when editing track info, opt/right click &amp; Get Info.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qDEfv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment188946> Check the carat in the top-right corner of the iTunes window when browsing your Music. Switch to Songs view. <comment188948> What do you mean? it is still there!
