Convert PDF to something editable without losing all formatting <body> I am aware of solutions that allow one to extract text from a pdf file. Are there any practical solutions on the Mac to extract rich text and layout from a PDF, or somehow convert a PDF into some editable format without losing all formatting, and without multi-column layouts ending up with the text from each column interwoven?  <answer27221> If you just want to edit the content of the PDF, Adobe Acrobat (full version) can do that. It can change/add/delete text, images, objects, etc.  <answer27224> A good converting site is zamzar.com. Not perfect, but quite good!  <comment31178> That's pretty much the Holy Grail you're talking about. As far as I know, you probably won't find a perfect solution--just something sort of close to it. PDF's are notoriously difficult to convert properly, let alone perfectly. <comment31179> Any approximation of accurate is better than doing it all by hand. <comment31216> D'oh. I hadn't even thought of that route. Good call. So obvious, and yet I was so oblivious. <comment31266> What does good and perfect mean in this context, what is your experience with the service? <comment77547> zamzar didn't work for my converting from a PDF to HTML, but it did successfully convert (the same PDF) to DOCX.
