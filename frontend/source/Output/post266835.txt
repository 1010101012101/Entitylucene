How do I restart the cron service on OSX? <body> precodeProductName:    Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.11.6 BuildVersion:   15G31  $ sudo cron restart cron: cron already running, pid: 257` /code/pre  None of the answers in here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10193788/restarting-cron-after-changing-crontab-file seem to apply to OSX. Well the one above is the closest one but it appears to be just telling me that cron is running so I don't have to worry about restarting it. Which isn't the point of restarting something.   How do I stop and restart the cron service on a Mac?   <answer266836> From the codecron/code man page:     The cron utility is launched by launchd(8) when it sees the existence   of /etc/crontab or files in /usr/lib/cron/tabs.  There should be no   need to start it manually.  See   /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist for details.   So, interstingly enough, codecron/code is launched by codelaunchd/code.  However, according to codeman crontab/code     (Darwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are   officially supported under Darwin, their functionality has been   absorbed into launchd(8), which provides a more flexible way of   automatically executing commands. See launchctl(1) for more   information.)   So, codecron/code which is launched by codelaunchd/code, has been deprecated for codelaunchd/code.  Using codecron/code is like wrapping bacon in bacon because you want bacon flavored bacon.  As far as restarting codecron/code, there is no need.  Once it sees a codecrontab/code file, it will automatically launch the job.    However, it's highly advisable that you start scheduling jobs using codelaunchd./code  <answer266837> The cron daemon is managed with launchctl.  If you insist on restarting it, you have to unload and load the respective launch daemon:  precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist /code/pre  strongBut: adding or removing arbitrary crontabs shouldn't require a reload of the daemon to enable or disable them./strong  The above launch daemon plist contains a emWatch Directory/em directive which detects (crontab) file creation and deletion or modified dates and "instructs" cron respectively.  <comment334657> What are you trying to achieve by restarting cron? <comment334662> I'm trying to achieve the restarting of cron; I see no harm in confirming that the service has absolutely positively seen the new crontab files <comment334663> I don't trust computers to see changes to files all the time so I'd like to confirm that it has the new files loaded by restarting <comment334665> -1, answers the question by saying "don't worry about it" <comment334666> If you type `crontab -l`; whatever is there is loaded.
