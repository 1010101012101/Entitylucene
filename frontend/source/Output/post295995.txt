iPhone 6s - can't restore, reboots from DFU to normal and asks for synch permission? <body> I'm experiencing an issue with my iPhone 6s.  I've not used it for a while and now said i need to synch it with iTunes to unlock it. Once i connected it to my PC it turned out that there are too many authorised devices, so I just removed it from my account.  At the moment i'm experiencing strange issue with restoring it - i put it in DFU mode, start the restoration process and as the soft is being downloaded (somewhere about 10 minutes form the beginning of restoration) my iPhone just reboots into normal mode, therefore iTunes asks for synch and stops restoration process.  How may i manage to restore it?
