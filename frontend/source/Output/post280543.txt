set the default audio output device in macOS <body> Is there a way to set the default audio output source in macOS. Or even better be able to set a hierarchical preference list, as to which audio output device you would prefer in a similar way to how you can with network connections in the network preference tabs?   <comment352897> I don't think there is. I wrote this solution based on an earlier script to hot-key outputs, but it's dependant on position in a list rather than specific output - http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/218223/85275
