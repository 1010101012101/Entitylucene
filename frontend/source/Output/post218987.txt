I lost my ripped cds from my Itunes library when I downloaded the latest version. <body> I lost my ripped ads when I downloaded the latest version of iTunes. They are still on my phone. Can they be transferred back?  <comment264872> That should read "ripped cds" <comment264873> You can edit your question yourself by using the 'edit' link at the bottom of the text. While doing so, please also add details about your OS, about your phone model and whether the music is just gone from iTunes or also from your computer (look in `Music/iTunes/...` to see if the tracks are still there). Also, how did you upgrade iTunes (an upgrade just replaces the application itself, it *shouldn't* impact your library)?
