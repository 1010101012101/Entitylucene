Make volume buttons only control headphones? <body> I'm trying to use soundflower and co. to record desktop sound, but I'd like to be able to adjust the volume of my headphones simultaneously.  The volume buttons adjust soundflower if I set the system sound device to soundflower and use LineIn to PlayThru to the headphones (same problem with soundflowerbed), or the volume buttons don't work at all if I use an aggregate device.  What can I do to make the volume buttons control the headphones and not soundflower (which I always want to be at max)?
