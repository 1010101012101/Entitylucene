Is there a htop-on-linux like alternative for top / Activity Monitor on OS X? <body> I'm looking for a better alternative for emtop/em. Both emtop/em and emActivity Monitor/em are highly limited with regards to features. In particular, I'm interested in the following features:  ul liLimit processes by name/li liSend different kill-signals to a process interactively, i.e. select the process from the process list and send a signal/li liAbility to show the entire command, not only the program name (as codetop -c/code does on Linux)/li liShow the status of each process/li liOptional: On Linux, emtop/em also emupdates/em the command when displayed, i.e. if a process writes in it's own codeargv/code during runtime, the updated command will be shown./li /ul  Htop is not an option, as it is unstable on Mac OS and only a small subset of it's features actually works on a Darwin system, probably because it partially relies on procfs. Is there a build or fork of htop that works on OS X since it has the features I want if it worked as it does on Linux?  <answer76639> Sending of signals and filtering by user is available out of the box. From codeman top/code  precode   INTERACTION           When top is run in interactive (non-logging) mode, it is possible to control the output of top, as well as  in-           teractively  send  signals to processes.  The interactive command syntax is terse.  Each command is one charac-           ter, followed by 0 to 2 arguments.     S&lt;signal&gt;&lt;pid&gt;           Send &lt;sig&gt; to &lt;pid&gt;.  &lt;sig&gt; can be specified either as a number or as a name (for example, HUP).   The  default           signal  starts  out as TERM.  Each time a signal is successfully sent, the default signal is updated to be that           signal.  &lt;pid&gt; is a process id.     U&lt;user&gt;           Only display processes owned by &lt;user&gt;.  Either the username or uid number can be specified.   To  display  all           processes, press enter without entering a username or uid number. /code/pre  If you want to extend codetop/code yourself, the source code is available on http://opensource.apple.com.  <answer89298> You can install htop on Mac through brew with the following command:  codebrew install htop-osx/code   Don' t forget to grant root privileges after the installation.  <answer107723> You can use process explorer for OS X - http://newosxbook.com/ has that as a free download. It's modeled after Linux top, and is much more powerful than Apple's own.  <comment88868> Thanks for the answer. Yes, I'm aware of that "feature"... however, specifying a signal *and* a PID is not really what counts as interactive... there is not improved comfort over writing "kill" on the commandline. I mean, the process should be selectable *interactively* (as in htop) <comment104752> Or with macports `sudo port install htop` <comment104868> As I said, htop is *not* an option. It's features very limited on Mac OS X, most of them simply don't work. <comment126525> 1. Could you link directly to the download. 2. Be sure to read over the [help] on promotion.
