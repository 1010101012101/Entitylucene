Keybad / Trackpad not detected on 2009 unibody Macook (El Capitan/ Mountain Lion) <body> I recently purchased a new ssd for my unibody 2009 MacBook (5,2) and installed el Capitan (10.11.0). Everything was fine until this and the keypad was working. So its not a software problem, probably.  I dont have a usb/sata connector so I had to reinstall my old HDD to copy the combo update to 10.11.6  I do that and reconnect the new ssd. And boom, the trackpad and keyboard was unresponsive. The power button was still working so i guess I got lucky.  Multiple PRAM and SMC resets, and restarts have had absolutely no effect.   I currently have ML on my old hdd and El Capitan (10.11.6) on the new ssd so if there's anything software related that needs to be changed, it pertains to these OS X builds.  I'm pretty desperate. HELP
