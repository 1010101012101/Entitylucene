flickering 1.5" or 2" column in screen of mac book pro early 2011 <body> I was sitting out door for 2hrs at evening and keep working with mac book; and at middle of the screen around 1.5" or 2" starts flickering. Sometime it stops flickering and back to normal. I did clear PRAM and NVRAM by pressing option+command+R+P.  What is the problem? and what is solution for it?  Is that OSX problem or hardware problem?
