Remove Shut Down from Login Window <body> Is there a way to remove the Shut Down option from the login window on Mac OS X (10.11.x) while preserving the ability to restart?  <answer239739> In strongTerminal/strong type this:br/ codedefaults write com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabled -true/code to hide the emShutdown/em option.   To restore it again, type:br/ codedefaults write com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabled -false/code  <answer239803> I don't know what the codedefaults write/code command is, but Mac Pilot can do this by setting this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gaoXt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I just confirmed it works in 10.11.5 without needing a reboot.  strongUpdate/strong  I figured out the codedefaults write/code:  codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabled -bool true/code  Afterwards, the command   codesudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabled/code   should equal code1/code.  <comment294447> Just tested this on Mac OS X 10.11.5 with and without sudo but it didn't remove the Shut Down option on the login window. Note: The Mac was indeed rebooted. <comment295124> I used the defaults write option and it worked!!!
