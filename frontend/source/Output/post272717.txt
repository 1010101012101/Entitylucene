macOS equivalent of the "where" command used in a Windows Command Prompt <body> In a Windows Command Prompt, I can find the location of things like Java and GIT by using the codewhere/code command.  For example, typing codewhere java/code yields codeC:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_05/code.  What is the macOS Terminal equivalent for the Windows Command Prompt command, codewhere/code?  <answer272718> The macOS Terminal equivalent of the Windows Command Prompt command codewhere/code is codewhich/code.  Typing codewhich java/code in my macOS Terminal yields code/usr/bin/java/code, and codewhich git/code yields code/usr/bin/git/code.  <comment342792> Depending on the shell that you use then other shell builtin commands such as type, command, or whence could be used.
