Install oracle 12c database in OS X Yosemite without Virtual Machine <body> Can we install strongOracle 12c/strong Database without using any Virtual Machine ? Currently I have installed it in emVMWare Fusion/em but it is consuming a lot of power.  <answer167179> Oracle Database 12c doesn't run on OS X, so I guess you'll have to stick to a VM running a supported OS (see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OG7Nk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer191626> Use Crossover or Wineskin for OS X  <answer208947> VM appears to be the only solution currently. You can attempt to dual boot your OS with a linux distribution, and install Oracle on that. I have only been able to install the instant client to get the SQL Developer to work on my OS X.  So something like this: /Library/Oracle/instantclient_11_2/network/admin/  on SQL Developer, you can then point the directory to the tnsnames.ora in this directory to get your connections..  <comment227606> 6 word answers are not enough. If you reccomend a program, put a detailed explanation and screenshots to using the program. <comment227629> and they won't work for Oracle <comment291525> I didnt work. sad
