Double-click headphone button to change track function <body> When listening to music on iTunes on my MacBook Air running OS 10.9, I am able to double-click the center headphone button to change track.   I am wondering if it is possible to replicate this behavior to when I am listening to music in e. g. Spotify.  <comment156834> Did you try it ? <comment156861> Yes, but with no success unfortunately. If a single-click the center button my latest played song on Itunes starts playing even though I have the Spotify window open.
