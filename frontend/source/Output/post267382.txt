unload kext when it is in use or retained (cannot unload) <body> I want to disable the trackpad on my laptop without a mouse connected. I need this strange functionality because I use synergy (https://symless.com/synergy/) and game with my desktop.   This is what I have tried so far,  precodekextstat -kl | awk '{print $6}'| grep -i multi  /code/pre  which gave   precodecom.apple.driver.AppleMultitouchDriver  /code/pre  Thus I went ahead and ran   precodesudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleMultitouchDriver /code/pre  which gave the error   precode(kernel) Can't remove kext com.apple.driver.AppleMultitouchDriver;    services failed to terminate - 0xdc008018.  Failed to unload com.apple.driver.AppleMultitouchDriver - (libkern/kext) kext is in use or retained (cannot unload) /code/pre  To be sure, I also tried another way (which was floating around stack exchange)   precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleMultitouchDriver.kext /code/pre  which produced the same error message.   Thanks in advance! I am a new user so please excuse my poor formatting.   For reference, I am using Sierra and the latest version of MacBook Pro 13 inch (no touchbar).
