Snap feature for Mac? <body> Coming from Windows I have gotten extremely used to the Windows Snap feature, which resizes a window when it's dragged to the screen edges.  However, it's not built into OS X. Are there any 3rd party utilities that add this functionality?  <answer9428> Your looking for HyperDock  ($9.95)     HyperDock brings advanced window management features to Mac OS:br    - Move &amp; resize windows just by holding down keys and moving your mouse.br    - Automatically resize windows when dragging to screen edges (Window Snapping).   <answer9430> You may also be looking for SizeUp (13$). That emulates the Windows Snap features better, I think.  <answer9433> You are looking for Cinch     Cinch gives you simple, mouse-driven window management by defining the left, right, and top edges of your screen as 'hot zones'. Drag a window until the mouse cursor enters one of these zones then drop the window to have it cinch into place.   <answer9435> For window arranging:  ul liSizeUp  $13/li liDivvy  $14/li liBreeze  $8/li liShiftIt  Free/li liMercury Mover  $20/li liOptimal Layout  $14/li liCinch  $7 /li liMoom  $10/li /ul  <answer9464> Cinch ($7) works a lot like Aero Snap.  Most of the time it's more convenient to use keyboard shortcuts though. For that I'd recommend ShiftIt. It's free, extremely simple and also has an action for Windows-style maximize.  For those possibly looking for snapping windows to screen elements: Zooom/2.  <answer9467> I've discovered another utility (released via the Mac App Store just today!) that seems to provide the exact functionality as Windows Snap. It's called Moom ($5), and it adds an iOS-style popover to the green Maximize button in Mac windows. The popover has buttons that let you do the following:  ul liRestore original position/li liZoom to full screen/li liMove to left, zoom to half width/li liMove to right, zoom to half width/li liMove to top, zoom to half height/li liMove to bottom, zoom to half height/li /ul  You can use the mouse or keyboard to invoke any of this window moving and zooming, and you get additional functionality if you use the keyboard. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like just the ticket.  <answer16667> I use bettertouchtool which includes this feature for free  this also alows you to create custom gestures for your trackpad / magic mouse / magic trackpad  <answer188028> Spectacle was mentioned in a question that was marked as duplicate of this one, but has not yet appeared here. It is also open source:  ul liSpectacle at Github/li /ul  Also, OS X El Capitan (OS X 10.11) will have a side-to-side snap feature when it is released later in 2015 using Mission Control.  <answer247656> This functionality is now built into Mac OS. Hold down the green resize button, and you then get an overlay on both sides of the screen that show which side you will be snapping to.  <comment9926> Agreed. My only reason for preferring HyperDock is cost and features, especially if you come from Windows 7 <comment9928> Any particular reason you deleted my inclusion of additional information? <comment9929> @Diago - I just rolled it back to your version, as it provides more information. <comment9942> @Dori Thank you <comment10093> possible duplicate of [What Window Management Options exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x) <comment14148> Damn that's a good list. <comment18174> Please add pricing info near the links. <comment18185> I'd personally vouch for free  [ShiftIt 1.5 by fukkovnik](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt). <comment18190> Love HyperDock!  It also adds an Aero Peek affect (window preview by hovering over the dock icon.) <comment108832> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x similar question, I use Moom which i know specifically does have the snap feature described. <comment187019> I asked this question today, didnt see this one and it was closed.  There is already an accepted answer, however before mine was closed I was told about Spectacle which is perfect and free/open source. <comment230050> [Better Touch Tool](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/) also does it and is free. <comment258518> Coming from Windows/Linux... these prices are _shocking_. :S <comment286900> BetterTouchTool is not free anymore. <comment298942> Spectacle is rather new, it's open source, the menu is simple, and it works well. <comment308294> Indeed!
