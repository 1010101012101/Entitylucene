Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local Could not symlink bin/bsondump Target /usr/local/bin/bsondump is a symlink belonging to mongodb30. You can unlink it:   brew unlink mongodb30  To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:   brew link --overwrite mongodb  To list all files that would be deleted:   brew link --overwrite --dry-run mongodb  Possible conflicting files are: /usr/local/bin/bsondump -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/bsondump /usr/local/bin/mongo -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongo /usr/local/bin/mongod -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongod /usr/local/bin/mongodump -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongodump /usr/local/bin/mongoexport -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongoexport /usr/local/bin/mongofiles -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongofiles /usr/local/bin/mongoimport -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongoimport /usr/local/bin/mongooplog -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongooplog /usr/local/bin/mongoperf -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongoperf /usr/local/bin/mongorestore -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongorestore /usr/local/bin/mongos -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongos /usr/local/bin/mongosniff -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongosniff /usr/local/bin/mongostat -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongostat /usr/local/bin/mongotop -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb30/3.0.12/bin/mongotop ==&gt; Caveats To have launchd start mongodb now and restart at login:   brew services start mongodb Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:   mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf ==&gt; Summary   /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.9: 17 files, 241.2M /code/pre  How do I make the link? Thanks  <answer255022> You have a typo in your command. You're typing:  precodebrew link mongod /code/pre  You should be typing:  precodebrew link mongodb /code/pre  Missing a coded/code on the end there. The codelink/code command takes a keg name, not a file name.
