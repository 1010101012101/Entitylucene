How to backup android device contacts on a mac? <body> How do you do it? The official android files trasfer app seems to transfer only files, not contacts.  How to?  <answer282898> In fact, I've found the way.  First you have to backup your contacts within your phone. They'll be saved as .vcf file. &lt;&lt;&lt; this is the main point.  Then you can use the officia android file transfer application. You'll see the file once you can see phone's folders.  hr  Side note: the application can't see your phone, first activate the USB debug from the developer options.  Hope it helps  <comment356552> Related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27936/whats-the-best-solution-to-sync-contacts-from-mac-to-android-phone?rq=1
