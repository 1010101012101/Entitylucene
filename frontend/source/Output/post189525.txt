Spring loaded folder settings missing in Yosemite <body> My spring loaded folder settings are missing from the Finder prefs in Yosemite.  img src="https://monosnap.com/file/AFOrKtFCJRBOUk8FDKNHH1Otn1OELU.png" alt="Finder &gt; Preferences &gt; General"  What might be the cause of this and how do I get all my options back?  FYI, I do have XtraFinder 0.25.4 installed but the option didn't move to the prefs there.  <answer189537> It appears that these settings have been removed from the Finder preferences window.  ul liThe slider is now located in System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse &amp; Trackpad  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pWkfn.png" width="668"/li liYou can change the spring-loaded delay by writing the setting manually:  precodedefaults write -g com.apple.springing.delay -float 1.0 &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Finder /code/pre  Replace code1.0/code with the delay in seconds before springing./li /ul  <comment224817> Any idea how to get them to show up again? The spring loading speed is causing problems. <comment224819> @eComEvo I've found where the preference has been moved to.
