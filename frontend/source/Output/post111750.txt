nfc option for NFS mount on Mavericks doesn't work <body> I have updated MacOSX to 10.9 (Mavericks). I want to mount NFS shares from a Linux server with the strongnfc/strong option because I have filenames with non-ASCII characters. But when I mount the network share it seems nfc is not working:  precode$ sudo mount -t nfs -o resvport,async,nfc 192.168.1.12:/media/disk1/downloads /Users/me/download/ $ mount | grep downloads 192.168.1.12:/media/disk1/downloads on /Users/me/download (nfs, asynchronous) /code/pre  And the character issue (accents, Ã±...) is there: they are shown as ??  <answer125813> Very late answer, but you should add nfc to code/etc/nfs.conf/code  codenfs.client.mount.options=nfc/code  codeman mount_nfs/code for details of the options.
