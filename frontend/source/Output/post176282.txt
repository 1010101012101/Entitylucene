Blocked contact and multitasking menu iOS 8 <body> What happens if I call or send a message to a contact I have blocked?   Does that contact show up on the recent contacts multitasking menu?  <answer176314> Yes. Even messages to blocked contacts display that blocked contact in "Recent" in the app switcher.   You can disable the "Recents" altogether if you would like. Go to Settings - Mail, Contacts, and Calendar - Show In App Switcher (under Contacts).   <comment208371> Thank you for your reactivity and detailed response.
