Presence of a Linux partition causes FileVault2 setup to fail <body> I'm currently dual booting Mountain Lion and Ubuntu 12.04 on a rMBP. Everything works fine, but enabling FileVault fails with the error message: "Some information was unavailable during an internal lookup." I receive the same error message if I run "Verify Disk" in Disk Utility.  By experimenting over the course of half a dozen reinstallations, I made the following observations:  ol liInstall Ubuntu 12.04 (x64, alternative Mac version) and GRUB - ERROR/li liAdd a codeext4/code or codebtrfs/code partition using Gparted on a LiveCD without installing GRUB - ERROR/li liRemoving the Linux partitions (but leaving the hybrid MBR) - NO ERROR/li /ol  As a result, my best guess is that OS X throws an error as soon as it detects a filesystem that it doesn't recognize. Has anyone else encountered this problem? How do get OS X to ignore my Linux partitions?  h2Update 1/h2  Adding 128 MiB of padding between partitions solves the "Verify Disk" error. Unfortunately, I still get the same error message when I attempt to enable FileVault 2. Interestingly, "Verify Disk" started returning errors as soon as I attempted to "Repair Disk." Disk Utility seems quite adept at corrupting its own partition tables...  h2Update 2/h2  I get more information if I run codefsck_cs/code from the terminal. It looks like this may be related to FireVault2 using CoreStorage. Here's the output:  precode$ sudo fsck_cs /dev/disk0 ** Checking volume.    Content Hint for disk0 is not Apple_CoreStorage ** disk0: Scan for Volume Headers    Invalid Volume Header @ 0: invalid field value    Invalid Volume Header @ 251000192512: invalid field value ** disk0 is not a CoreStorage volume /code/pre  <answer61221> I believe I found the issue: Apple expects 128 MiB of free space between every partition. Disk Utility hides this free space, similar to how it hides the ESP. If this padding isn't present, it generates the error I described above.  Easy fix: Tell Gparted to use +128 MiB as the beginning offset for each partition.  strongEdit:/strong Nevermind, this only solves the "Verify Disk" problem...I still can't enable FileVault. See above for an update.  <comment70628> Interesting! Is your partition map GUID? <comment70630> Yes, it's GPT with a hybrid MBR. I'm working on EFI booting Ubuntu to ditch the hybrid MBR, but I haven't gotten it quite working yet. <comment70690> Nevermind. This only solves some of the problems. See above for an update. <comment70697> FileVault won't work on an MBR partition map <comment70704> I'm using a GPT partition map and have the same problem even if I manually restore the protective MBR. Is there any way that the MBR could still be the problem? <comment70737> It's certainly probable. My understanding was unless its just a plain old GPT (and any non Mac volumes being created by boot camp) then it won't work. I could be wrong.
