The L2TP-VPN server did not respond - OS X Mountain Lion (happened after change of Router) <body> I used to be able to connect to VPNgate's servers  but ever since I changed to a new router (one of the new Netgear Nighthawks), it just stopped working.   I followed the guide on their site to setup the vpn connection, and it worked before. Now, it just gives me an error:   precodeThe L2TP-VPN server did not respond. Try reconnecting. If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator. /code/pre  I tried the following:   ul liRebooted computer many times/li liConfigured around with the keychain access (some people reported to have success once they allowed all applications to access vpn certificate)/li liLooked around router settings but saw nothing special /li /ul  I am using a Macbook Pro Retina 15 inch, and I am running OS X 10.8.2  Below is a log of what happens when I try to connect.  hr  precode4/22/15 5:20:19.815 PM pppd[15702]: IPSec connection started 4/22/15 5:20:19.825 PM racoon[15703]: Connecting. 4/22/15 5:20:19.826 PM racoon[15703]: IPSec Phase1 started (Initiated by me). 4/22/15 5:20:19.826 PM racoon[15703]: IKE Packet: transmit success.
