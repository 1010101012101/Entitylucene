AppleScript - mdfind kMDItemTextContent script to find specified content from display dialog query <body> I have this AppleScript find all documents whose content matches the text 'theMessage' and it works perfectly fine:  set matchText to paragraphs of (do shell script "mdfind \"kMDItemTextContent == 'theMessage'\"") set targetMatch to (choose from list matchText) as string if targetMatch ≠ "false" then tell application "Finder" to open (POSIX file targetMatch) as alias  but I would like to improve it so that I can search for any text I specify  For example:  set searchText to text returned of (display dialog "Enter your search text:" default answer "")  and then continue on with previous script, with this simple change:  set matchText to paragraphs of (do shell script "mdfind \"kMDItemTextContent == searchText\"")  I just can't seem to get it to take searchText as a variable  <answer170480> Try:  precodeset searchText to text returned of (display dialog "Enter your search text:" default answer "") set matchText to paragraphs of (do shell script "mdfind \"kMDItemTextContent == " &amp; quoted form of searchText &amp; "\"") if matchText ≠ {} then     set targetMatch to (choose from list matchText) as string     if targetMatch ≠ "false" then tell application "Finder" to open (POSIX file targetMatch) as alias end if /code/pre
