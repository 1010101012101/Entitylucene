Stop Console.app from auto-scrolling while I'm reading a log <body> When using Appleâ€™s Console.app to read logs, the window automatically scrolls to the bottom when a new entry is posted to the log. But I'm trying to read something in the middle of the log.  Is there some way to shutoff this emauto-scroll-to-bottom/em feature?  <answer141723> Does disabling the codeNow/code button in the bottom right of Console help? It should stop the log from scrolling with new updates.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LcuzJ.png" alt="Console"  <comment167003> I had no idea that button was modal. Seems like an odd user-interface. When clicked so the "Now" button has a blue background the auto-scroll feature is "ON", grey background means "OFF". At least in Mountain Lion, Mac OS X 10.8.x. Thanks. <comment167072> Yep, you got the idea! Glad to help.
