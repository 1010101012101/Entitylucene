Macbook charger led keeps flashing even though it isn't plugged <body> My Macbook Pro charger LED (T Type) working fine as a charger. But even though I plug it off, (make it separated from mac) it still keeps flashing. If I separate it when it was orange, it keeps flashing orange; if it was green, after separation, it keeps green.  How is that possible? Is it a problem? How can I solve this?  <comment324018> If you unplug and plug in your adapter while ***NOT*** plugged into the Mac, does the blinking stop?  If it does stop, what happens when you plug it back into the Mac? <comment324115> I have a charger that does that, too. I assume it's a capacitor that's holding a charge. Probably not a problem. Although I'm no electrical engineer...
