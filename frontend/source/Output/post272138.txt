Headphones unexpectedly stopped working? <body> Recently, my Macbook Air (Mac OS Sierra) ran out of batteries. When I tried to turn it on, the screen was all black so I shut it off. When I turn it back on, the headphones don't work. I've tried to open Audio MIDI Setup, but it shows this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4yHt.png" alt="Boxes unchecked and sound up"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Q876.png" alt="Boxes checked and sound muted"  As you can see, the boxes are unchecked when the volume is up, but they are checked when the volume is muted. Either way, I cannot hear anything through the headphones.  P.S.-- I've tried this before, but I don't remember what I did.  <answer274203> The headphones were broken; try different ones.  <comment342132> I may have just broke my headphones. I'll get a new pair and check to see if they work.
