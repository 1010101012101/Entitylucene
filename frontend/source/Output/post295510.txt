When I use Command + L I get a zsh terminal in Chrome. How can I focus on address bar in Chrome <body> Some how my kbdCmd/kbd kbdL/kbd shortcut is assigned to another thing. How can I make it default so that it will focus on address bar in Chrome?  <answer295511> Ok, I found that my iTerm  Preference  Hotkey was on.  After turning it off, it works now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NRBIOm.png" alt="enter image description here"
