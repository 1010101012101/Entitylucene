Resize window tolerance <body> I'm fairly new to using a Mac, and have a bit of an odd issue. When first setup, I was able to resize windows/panes etc pretty quickly and easily, however for some reason the 'hit' area(?) for resizing windows seems to have changed so that I have what seems like a single pixel area to move my mouse into to be able to resize a window. Previously this area felt more like 5px or so. Is there a way to somehow increase this hit area/tolerance?  Hope that makes sense!?  <comment309912> Finder windows or (other) apps' windows? Finder windows' best "handle" areas are the corners and **not** the edges... <comment309916> Appears to be any application - tested in Sublime Text 2, Chrome, Finder, Photoshop
