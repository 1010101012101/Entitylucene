Emptying trash of the USB drive <body> I have a USB drive plugged into my Mac. What I found was code.Trashes/code was not emptied when the emptying trash (right click the emTrash/em icon and run "Empty Trash") for the USB drive  What might be wrong? Is there any other way to empty trash the USB drive?   <answer6435> strongUsual behavior:/strongbr When you delete something off a USB drive, it is moved to a code.Trashes/code folder on that volume. When plugged into your computer, deleted items will appear in your trash bin with everything else.  When you unplug it, items that you've deleted from that drive will no longer show up in your trash UNTIL you plug it in again. Then, you can empty the trash. It will emreally/em delete them from that drive.  If that isn't happening for you, here's my suggestion:  ol liSelect the drive in your Finder sidebar. /li liWithout selecting anything else, press codecmd-i/code (or use menu item codeFile/code â†’ codeGet Info/code). /li liUse the codeSharing and Permissions/code section of that window to give codeEveryone/code the permissions to codeRead and Write/code./li /ol  <answer6436> I don't know wether it's the best answer, but at least it's working answer.  Open the command line, cd to the USB volume (/Volumes/USB for my case), and type:  precode/bin/rm -rf ./Trashes/* works fine with me. /code/pre  <answer6439> It's possible that there are files in some emother user/em's trash.  The code.Trashes/code folder at the top of each volume has subfolders for each different user, by user ID number (e.g. user 502's trash is in code.Trashes/502/code).br You can see if it for yourself using a command like this (replace codeVolumeName/code with your drive name):   precodels -la /Volumes/VolumeName/.Trashes/ total 0 d-wx-wx-wt@  3 _unknown  _unknown   102 10 Feb 18:15 . drwxrwxrwx@ 21 root      wheel      782 13 Feb 14:17 .. drwx------@ 35 _unknown  _unknown  1190 13 Feb 14:18 502 /code/pre  As you can see, on my USB disk code.Trashes/code folder there's a sub folder called code502/code, owned by user ID 502 (for reference, my current user ID is 501). Since this user doesn't exist on my system, I see it as code_unknown/code, and my user can't look inside of it, neither delete it.  To look inside that folder we need to do it as administrator (i.e. use codesudo/code).  If you are sure that you want to, you can delete emeveryone/em's trash by deleting the entire code.Trashes/code folder with a command like:  precodesudo rm -R /Volumes/volumeName/.Trashes /code/pre  strongWarning:/strong as with anything involving codesudo/code (em"do as super user"/em, i.e. system administrator) and coderm -R/code, use this carefully. If you type it wrong, it could have ... emunpleasant/em consequences.  <answer103573> 2 Solutions. 1 using Bash the other using Bash wrapped in AppleScript.  h2Solution #1/h2  ol liCreate a new AppleScript with code/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor/code/li liType the following code:   do shell script "rm -rf /Volumes/*/.Trashes/*" with administrator privileges/li liSave the file to somewhere convenient and run it whenever you need to clear the USB Trash/li liThis can be executed by double-clicking on it/li /ol  strongNOTE:/strong This will empty the Trash for all connected volumes including your internal hard disk.

This script removes the items from your trash (user ID) folder on the volume. if other users use the volume  this script will not delete the items from their  trash folder, otherwise the script would need an administrator password to do that.  hr  If you want to eject the volume after emptying the trash, use this script.  precodeon open these_volumes     set t_id to user ID of (system info)     set volToEject to {}     repeat with i in these_volumes         if (kind of (info for i without size)) is "Volume" then             set tPath to (POSIX path of i) &amp; ".Trashes/" &amp; t_id             do shell script "/bin/rm -Rf  " &amp; (quoted form of tPath) &amp; "/*"             set end of volToEject to contents of i         end if     end repeat     if volToEject is not {} then tell application "Finder" to eject volToEject end open /code/pre  <comment6711> Interesting, emptying the trash always does so successfully for my USB drives. My only complaint about it is that often I'd like to *only* empty the trash on my USB drive and not have to do so for every drive on the system. <comment6713> @Matthew try `rm -R /Volumes/volumename/.Trashes/$UID` <comment6717> @Gordon Perfect, thanks! Created a one-line Applescript to run the command and it's a couple of QuickSilver keystrokes any time. <comment82739> The "might be in someone else's Trash" is _exactly_ the issue I was running into. This should be better advertised! <comment121872> This would require the user has to go to the specific volume each time. Building on your reply, I've come up with a Bash script and AppleScript solution. <comment121874> Adding the -f switch to the command will force the action. Substituting the "volumename" with "*" would allow you to connect multiple USB drives and empty all the Trash on all of them simultaneously. Don't have to connect 1-by-1 and then re-do. <comment170381> This should be accepted <comment203805> To make the applescript work, simply drag the connected device or drive to the AppleScript application and drop. You can create an alias on the dock next to the regular trash bin for convenience, by dragging and dropping the Application icon into the side-dock. <comment343029> It may be dangerous to run a command that involves both `sudo rm` and  `/Volumes/*/something`, because it could affect even your system drive, and a typo can have bad consequences.
