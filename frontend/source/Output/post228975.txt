How to listen to older Prairie Home Companion shows with Mac OS X? <body> I am interested in listening to older Prairie Home Companion shows on my MacBook Air 13 (mid-2012).  An example is http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2006/12/16/.  Those older shows say "Requires free RealAudio player."  The RealAudio player download for Mac doesn't work on my MBA13.  I've searched the web for advice.  There is some that seems relevant, but I haven't found any that is concise and complete that would apply to my setup.  My MBA13 is running El Capitan 10.11.3.  <comment279252> What version of RealPlayer are you using? Add a screenshot of the **About RealPlayer** dialog box to your question so we can see exactly what it is you're using.  I have no problem playing a show, from the link in your question, using RealPlayer 12.0.1 (1750) under OS X 10.8.5.  That said, I do not know if that version of RealPlayer will work under OS X 10.11.x.  I'm a big fan of PHC. :) <comment279257> Here's the [direct download URL for RealPlayer 12.0.1 (1750)](http://client-software.real.com/free/mac/RealPlayerSP.dmg). <comment279297> I downloaded a RealPlayer dmg file that said it wouldn't work on an Intel Mac.  I've now downloaded from the link that you gave and that works.  I could probably retrace where I got the other one, but am not sure that is of interest (I had already trashed all traces of it).  If you wish credit for an answer that worked, I'll be happy to give it. <comment279298> I'm also a big fan of PHC.  The show I referenced was my first introduction to poet Billy Collins--a frequent guest.  I'm now a fan of his also. :)
