You first need to repair the damage. Sounds like it is the root/boot disk, which means you don't want to try using it.   Yes you can boot your damaged Mac into Target disk mode by pressing the T key right after powering it on. Then plug it into another Mac. The damaged disk will appear as a drive on the good Mac. Run diskutil to repair your damaged disk.  <comment363472> Please pretty up your barren question with some details like `sudo gpt -r show disk0` and/or `diskutil list` by entering these commands in Terminal.app and adding the output(s) to your question. <comment363473> There's nothing harmful in connecting over target disk mode and seeing what you can restore / repair / recover. putting in the details klanomath needs is a great idea - you might simply have a small corruption in a lookup table and need a tiny band aid and not reconstructive surgery or worse. <comment363477> It likely depends on how much messing around you've already done on the disk to get into your current state - ref: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/286480/macbook-wont-boot-after-creating-two-small-partitions Note that backups are what you need **before** your drive fails, not afterwards. <comment363479> Can I get back all of my files in Target disk mode? <comment363489> You have the same chance in Target Disk Mode as if you took out the drive & mounted it directly. You will still need to choose some kind of recovery software, Disk Drill etc. Adding the info requested by klanomath will give a better clue. <comment363542> I don't have another Mac will an AASP allow to access my files on their Mac? <comment363545> Is it ok if I install an OS on the 15GB partition because I  have already installed the OS on the partition and it works fine. <comment363546> Yes if you are starting over that is fine. You won't be able to recover the old data any more, but you can start fresh yes. <comment363551> So can I atleast recover my photos and my desktop? <comment363786> I assume the problem relates to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/286480/macbook-wont-boot-after-creating-two-small-partitions.
