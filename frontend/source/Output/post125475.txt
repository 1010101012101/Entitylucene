Unable to view mounted volume in Finder <body> I am unable to access data on mounted volumes in Finder on OS X Mavericks.  Assuming I mounted a volume by plugging in an external USB disk.  strongWhat works:/strong  ul liThe volume is listed in the Finder sidebar/li liI can access (read+write) it under code/Volumes/MyDeviceName//code/li liI see it being listed properly when calling codemount/code from the shell/li /ul  strongWhat doesn't work:/strong  ul liI cannot click on it in the Finder sidebar/li liWhen I open code/Volumes/code with Finder, codeMyDeviceName/code is not visible/li liWhen I try to open code/Volumes/MyDeviceName/code it says codeThe folder can't be found./code/li /ul  This problem doesn't only occur with external USB devices, but also with TrueCrypt Volumes, etc. I thought it might be an NTFS problem, but it also occurs with other file system types.  I've tried to reset the Finder preferences by deleting codecom.apple.finder.plist/code, as per suggestion by other threads, but this has not solved the issue.  <answer126898> I managed to fix the issue, which appears to have been a bug or incompatibility with Tuxera NTFS driver (which makes NTFS writable) and Mavericks.  I updated the dependency and it worked. This threw me at first, since I also experienced the issue with non-NTFS volumes. Now however, everything works fine.  <comment146851> Try disk Utility and repair permission there for that drive.
