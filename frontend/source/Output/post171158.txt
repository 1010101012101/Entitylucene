finding out iPhone usages information <body> I would like to buy a 2nd hand iPhone. is there any service exist where i can check when it was activated or when actually the user started using this iPhone.  <answer171164> From this webservice provided by Apple you can get some data about the phone with its serial number.   It doesn't give you the purchase date but you can infer it from warranty end.
