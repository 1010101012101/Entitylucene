How can I input ctrl+` (grave accent)? <body> Normally when typing code`/code, I have to hold shift down and press code´/code, and a "dead" version of the grave accent appears. I then have to press space to get the "living" version of the grave accent.  You can see here what I mean by living and dead (dead keys):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aiK4n.png" alt="Screenshot"  If I want to open the console in Sublime Text 2, I can use the menu bar to open it, however, I would rather use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+`  Neither using ctrl+shift+´ or ctrl+´ works.  How would I input this keyboard shortcut?  strongNote:/strong I already know that you can edit the keyboard shortcut for the menu item in System Preferences, but I have seen other applications also requiring keyboard shortcuts I can't input using my keyboard layout (Danish).  I don't want to change my keyboard layout either, not even temporary.  <answer88935> Some keyboard layouts (like Finnish, but not Danish) have a normal backtick under ⌥⇧´, so for example ⌃⌥⇧´ opens the console in Sublime Text.  If you don't want to switch to another keyboard layout, you can use Ukelele to modify the Danish layout. See this question.
