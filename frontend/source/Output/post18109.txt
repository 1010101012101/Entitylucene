How do I pause a download in the Launchpad in OS X Lion? <body> I started downloading XCode on my 10 mbit/s but it is 4 GB and I want to pause it for a while.  <answer18111> If you're downloading via the App Store, if you click on the Purchased icon at the top of the App Store window, I emthink/em that there's the option to Pause an active download. I seem to remember seeing it while I downloaded Lion earlier today.  <answer18119> Open Mission Control and just click on the Downloading Xcode icon. This will pause it. Clicking again will resume.
