Can't open Java Preferences with Oracle Java 7 installed <body> I have both Oracle Java 7 and Apple Java 6 installed. Apple Java 6 is disabled in Java Preferences.  Now, when I try to launch Java Preferences I get a "Cannot launch "Java Preferences - No compatible version of Java 1.5+ is available." error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ti3RD.png" alt="Java Preferences error"  This is the output of code/usr/libexec/java_home -V/code:  precodeMatching Java Virtual Machines (1):     1.7.0_05, x86_64:   "Java SE 7" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.7.0.jdk/Contents/Home  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.7.0.jdk/Contents/Home /code/pre  Besides the (Oracle) code1.7.0.jdk/code folder,  code/System/Library/Java/code also contains a code1.6.0_31-b04-413.jdk/code folder.  <answer60697> I've solved it by installing Java for OS X 2012-004 from Apple.  <answer63464> Java for OS X 2012-004 isn’t available any longer. But 2012-005 solved the issue for me.  <answer83491> You need to install Apple's Java package.  Currently, the latest version is 2013-001  <comment108333> http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1515 is not found, error 404. <comment108334> http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572 no longer refers to 2012-005. DL1572 is currently for Java for OS X 2013-003. <comment108335> With more recent distributions of Java from Apple and Oracle, the question is no longer applicable; an update from Apple explicitly removes Java Preferences from the Utilities folder. <comment108336> [Java for OS X 2012-006 removed Java Preferences](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5493), readers should not expect Apple's more recent distribution to reinstall the app.
