how to SSH to my UNIX box? <body> I have installed 2 SSH strongclients/strong on my iPad Air2 running iOS 8.3 and no matter what I do, it won't connect. The iPad just can't see the servers (I have 2). I didn't even get the username prompt.  ol liI've checked the IP used several times and that's not the problem/li liI've connected via SSH using my MBPr and no problem there./li /ol  Any ideas what I could be doing wrong? thanks a lot  <comment226311> You're certain the iPad and the server are both on the same WiFi network, correct? <comment226316> Can you give us more information about your network?  Are all of the devices on the same subnet?  Is your iPad possibly on cellular and not connected to wifi?  Is this your home network, or is it a business with a more complex configuration? <comment226334> My iPad is connected to the same home  router as my servers. I've checked the ip for all devices involved and it's all good <comment226373> "ssh -vvv" and share the debugging messages that are displayed.  When you don't supply any technical details about your problem, it is very difficult to provide any solutions.
