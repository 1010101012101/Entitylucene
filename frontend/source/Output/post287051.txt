How to use mdfind on "shared" filesystem? <body> I am testing out tagging on a remote file. It works fine in finder if I use "Shared" instead of "This Mac" on the finder window, but when using mdfind with -onlyin pointing to the remote file system just generates a lot of "bad path long-id-string" and none of the hits that should be found.   In finder, the response is immediate, so I was hoping to be able to use mdfind with similar response. Any idea how to tell mdfind not to look at the local filesystem?   <comment367304> What kind of remote file system are you trying to access? IIRC, any `mdfind` command assumes the metadata for the files are held in the Spotlight database on the local machine.
