Tasks needing admin password (Finder, Installer) hang with beachball for minutes <body> Taks needing and admin password, like deleting certain files in the Finder or running an application installer, hang for minutes with a beachball. After a couple of minutes the dialog asking for an admin password appears finally.   Once the window finally appears it also takes a minute to be usable. After I entered the password everything works just fine.  The same also happens when trying to mount a disk image with a password. It takes minutes for the password window to show up.  I can't see anything happen in Activity Monitor. CPU usage is low and RAM is plentiful. Other applications continue to run quickly.

I would also repair the System permissions (in disk Utility) and the User permissions (the ACLs)  <comment200254> Did you try restoring the permissions, the System and the User?
