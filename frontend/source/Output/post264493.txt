Does Apple recover tax paid to government on sales on apps? <body> I signed up to sell my apps on the Apple app stores, and the agreement says:     Apple shall collect and remit to the competent tax authorities the   taxes described in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2 for sales of the   Licensed Applications to End-Users located in the following countries,   as updated from time to time via the iTunes Connect site:      Albania Australia Austria Belgium Bulgaria Canada China* Croatia   Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece   Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malta,   Republic of Netherlands New Zealand++ Norway Poland Portugal Romania   Slovakia South Africa Slovenia Spain Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom   United States   Does Apple recover this tax from me? In other words, will I end up paying more than 30% to Apple when a user from one of these countries buys my app?  <answer264540> Apple handles the sales of your app. Technically Apple is the seller, so they collect the taxes. That is why Apple gets 30% of every sold app.   The 70% you get from an app sale are royalties. You only need to add it to your Income Tax.
