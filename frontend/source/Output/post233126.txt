Zip email with con AppleScript <body> I need to zip all email that have in the body this words "Identificativo messaggio: CA3DA789.008822A5.C33F80AE". I have many email in AppleMail  so i think if it's possible to create an AppleScript that select all email that have in their body this Word "Identificativo messaggio: CA3DA789.008822A5.C33F80AE". Once AppleScript find these mails,  unzip them and tell me where Save the file zip and with witch name. It's possible to create this AppleScript ?  Every day i must zip the email and with search box i need of much time. So i think to use an AppleScript that work in this mode: I select an mail that contain "identificativo n. *****" and Applescript find all Mail with the same "identificativo n. *****". After selected mail, i could zip these files or stamp with their attachements.  <answer233186> It's certainly possible to do this with AppleScript, but depending on how often you need to do this it might be simpler to just  ul liUse the search box within Mail to list all mails containing this specific string/li liDrag them into a folder on the Desktop/li liCompress/zip that folder/li /ul  <comment284957> Anything is possible in AppleScript. It's a script language used to do stuff in folders, and many other graphical projects <comment285179> If you want to add additional information to the question, you can just edit the question directly using the "edit" link at its bottom. <comment285191> Your question is unclear: Do you want to unzip attachments (or zip mails - which doesn't make much sense)? Also show us your own research and how far you got with your Apple Script!
