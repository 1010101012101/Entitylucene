Can the Apps game that sign in using google account hotmail move to Apple ID? <body> I have use my google account for example: ASD123@hotmail.com (google account/ google play account) to sign in every apps game to save the progress and data on Android.  And now I have change a new phone which is iphone. Can I use the google account email to create an Apple ID? If it is yes, then can I retrieve back all the progress and data when I use the Apple ID to sign in for the game with the same email with google account?  <comment318109> I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but you can use whatever email address you wan to create an Apple ID.  Apple won't know anything about the games you played on Android, using that same email address, unless the app developer stores that info in the cloud somewhere. <comment318129> @fbara okay thank you, I understand your answer, I really hope those app developer or company can sync them by email instead of apple id or google account. It will be more convenient when user switching from android to ios or either way.
