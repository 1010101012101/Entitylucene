Macbook and 4K monitor <body> Please, does anyone know whether Macbook (2015) with MacOS Sierra (10.12) is able to drive Dell P2415Q 4K (3840x2160) monitor at 60Hz? What dongles do I need?  I have USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter which is said to support "UHD (3840 by 2160) at 30Hz". But Apple's Using 4K displays, 5K displays, and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac states:     With macOS 10.12 or later, MacBook (2015 and later) and MacBook Pro (2016 and later) support these resolutions and refresh rates over HDMI 1.4b using the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter:      ul   li4096x2304 at 48Hz refresh rate/li   li3840x2160 at 60Hz refresh rate (mirroring is not supported at this resolution)/li   /ul      MacBook (2016 and later) and MacBook Pro (2016 and later) support 60Hz refresh rates over HDMI when used with a supported HDMI 2.0 display, an HDMI Premium Certified cable, and a supported USB-C to HDMI 2.0 adapter.   So I'm confused now: would it work somehow? Would it work over HDMI? Would it work over DisplayPort? Is the adapter I have suitable?  <answer286715> Per Apple's MacBook Specifications page:     h3Intel HD Graphics 5300/h3      Dual display and video mirroring:   Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display   and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on an external display, both at millions   of colors   What's important to understand here is that this is not a Thunderbolt port - this is USB-C only.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nn1z3.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, to make this work, you need an Active USB-C to DisplayPort Adapter or an Active USB-C to HDMI Adapter  Please reference this post where I detail the difference between Active vs. Passive Adapters  <answer286869> Answer is yes with the right USB C to DP adapter. I have a 2015 MacBook and I have tried it with two very different 4K displays - one Philips, one LG - and both worked correctly at 4K 60Hz. If fact, they work in Bootcamp, too at 4K 60hz. Impressive.   FYI, I understand this capability arrived with the Sierra MacOS update. Earlier MacOS versions limit you to 30Hz on this MacBook.  I use a Club3D branded adapter.  <comment361846> Wouldn't something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-DisplayPort-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B01J6DT070) work? <comment361855> Allan, OP is specifying the 2015 MacBook, not the 2015 MacBook Pro, and specifies the USB-C adapter they have, so I am pretty sure OP is NOT referring to the same laptop you are. <comment361856> @NoahL - you're right...I don't know why I saw "pro" in his question. <comment361858> @NoahL That would be an option, perhaps, but unfortunately the Macbook only has one USB C port so I'm not sure how would I charge it, hence that Multiport Adapter..? <comment361859> Have you contacted Dell and asked them?  There's several dozen "will this adapter work with my Mac?" questions on the site, have you searched for similar questions/answers? <comment361862> Thanks, but the cited page is for the current line of Macbooks, whereas 2015 model has Intel HD 5300. <comment362098> How do you charge the Macbook if the USB-C port is used for DP adapter? Do the monitors supply the power or does the adapter have additional USB-C ports? <comment362590> @Rhem - true...I fixed it, though the solution is still exactly the same.
