Apple Mail - When saving as draft, signature block is changed <body> I have 6 email addresses that I send from in my mail client. Each address has a different signature block. When I save a message as a draft (after choosing which email it will send from so the appropriate signature is applied), the signature looks good. When I open the draft back up, it always goes back to a default signature. Any ideas on how to get the draft to accurately save the signature block each time? Thanks!
