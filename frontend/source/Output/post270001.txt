Will iPhone SE price likely be reduced 1 year after its debut? <body> the iPhone SE came out last March, and rumour is that it won't be updated this year. Will it likely see a price drop this cycle? Is it best to hold off till March to buy one?  <answer270004> Only Apple knows the answer to this question.  While one may think that Apple could lower the price it could in fact go up: Depending on the country you are living prices have been increased in the past due to currency fluctuations.  IMO it's unlikely that we will see a price drop for the iPhone SE. For Apple it's a device with a really low profit margin compared to other products. It has most of the iPhone 6s' internal specs so Apple is in no hurry to upgrade it either.  I think if you emneed/em a new iPhone because your old one is broken, buy it now.  <comment339276> Although its not certain without inside information I don't see this question as opinion-based; anyone with knowledge of Apples historical pricing approach can answer it.
