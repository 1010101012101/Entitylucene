keyboard shortcut to rename the title of terminal? <body> I have switched from Ubuntu to macOS (strongSierra 10.12.5/strong) recently and I am missing few very basic keyboard shortcut in the terminal.   I used to open multiple terminal in tabs and set name of each tab  but couldn't find any keyboard shortcut so far, although I am using kbdCMD/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdI/kbd which open the inspector window separately and there I can set the title name but again there is no way to close that inspector window using keyboard.  Kindly tell us if there any shortcut to do that?  <answer293661> You are emalmost there/em.  You can open the inspector to set the title name with kbdCMD/kbd + kbdShift/kbd+kbdI/kbd  In order to close it you can press kbdESC/kbd  OR use the inspector toggle shortcut - kbdCMD/kbd + kbdI/kbd
