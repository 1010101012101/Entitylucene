Does macOS Sierra do mac address randomisation? I know that iOS does it <body> Does macOS Sierra do mac address randomisation? I ask if because wonder if I need to run SpoofMAC when in hotel or foreigns hotspots (mobile MacBook Air)  precodebrew install spoof-mac spoof-mac list sudo brew services start spoof-mac sudo spoof-mac randomize en0 /code/pre  <answer282608> Natively, no, but you can change the MAC address yourself.  I think it reverts upon reboot though.  The command is codesudo ifconfig &lt;interface&gt; ether &lt;new mac address&gt;/code  For example, codesudo ifconfig en0 ether 12:34:56:12:34:56/code  You may need to toggle the interface as well codesudo ifconfig en0 down/code and up  As per this site (https://blog.macsales.com/37428-tech-tip-finding-and-changing-your-mac-address-in-os-x) you can make a random MAC like this   precodeopenssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//' /code/pre  <comment356222> I assume since you're not normally walking around all day with your laptop wifi on and looking for networks it's much less of a potential issue so Apple doesn't bother. Is this something you're actually worried about, or just curious? <comment356283> @ToddDabney in public transport
