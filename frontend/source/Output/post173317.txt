How can I continue a partial, interrupted download of Yosemite? <body> I was trying to download OS X Yosemite. It is very big - more than 5GB.  The download did not succeed due to some problem in internet connection. Only 2.5 GB is downloaded and I wanted to continue from where it stopped. I closed the Mac App Store and reopened. I lost what was downloaded till that time. I want to know where it is stored in my Mac so that I could start from there. It saves me lot of time and internet download usage, since it is a limited internet plan.  <answer173319> It is stored in the Application folder - if it doesn't continue, then delete the already downloaded file, and retry from the App Store again.  <answer173330> To resume your download:  ol liOpen the Mac App Store./li liFrom the Store menu, choose Sign In./li liEnter your Apple ID and password./li liClick Purchases to get to your Purchases Page.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6lvR.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the Resume button next to the app name.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gFHI6.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  emSource:/em http://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202159
