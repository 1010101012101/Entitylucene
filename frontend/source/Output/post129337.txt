Applescript to forward email but preserve sender <body> How can I make an Applescript that Mail.app on my Mac can run? When it encounters a message that is being sent to mac@email.com, I'd like it to redirect it to email@gmail.com, where the "From" field is NOT mac@email.com, but rather is the "From" field on the original email that was sent to mac@email.com.  E.g., I'm Joe Schmo and I send an email from joeschmo@joe.com to mac@email.com. Then the Apple Script runs and redirects that email to send it to email@gmail.com with the From tag as joeschmo@joe.com  I am planning on setting up a rule in my Mail app that runs this apple script when it encounters a message that is being sent to mac@email.com.  Note: the emails in this example are fake.  <answer129344> Well, there is no definitive answer because it depends on your email provider.  Normally an email provider will refuse an email with a FROM: field that not matches with the logged-in user. And on the other hand: What you want is a job for your email provider - he could give you the possibility to forward a mail with a preserving FROM: field.  I can´t give you an applescript because I think you won´t will use it, because of a refusing email provider.  If you want to test the whole thing please you could do this via telnet.  <answer129357> You should be able to use the "Redirect" option, under the Message menu. Actually, if I'm reading your question right, you should be able to do this entirely through a rule, with no Applescript needed.   Building from "How to batch forward messages from Mail.app", if you make a rule that targets emails sent to mac@email.com, just say "Redirect Message" to "email@gmail.com".

All others you could learn from the link above. <comment183659> @RobertStephens: Well, you´ve asked and I answered  - no reply is rude.
