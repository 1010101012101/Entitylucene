How do I force the camera to focus on a distant object and not the window screen? <body> Whenever I take a picture or video out my window, it always focuses on the screen instead of what I actually want to take a picture of. I can press on the screen to adjust the white levels, or press-hold to lock the auto-focus, but there doesn't appear to be any way to force it to focus far instead of near. How do I force the camera to focus on distant objects instead of the near screen?  iOS 10.3.1  <comment353038> I don't think it's possible with the default camera.  Have you tried 3rd-party camera apps?  They might use software to do the focusing instead of the camera lens.
