iPhone Email client includes wrong Original Message in body of reply <body> I'm using an iPhone 6, running iOS 9.2.1. Recently, I experienced an issue with my iPhone email client. I hit "Reply All" on an strongEmail A/strong, composed my reply message, and hit "Send," but the email that was sent had some very incorrect information.  The subject line in my reply email was correct: "Re: Subject A," and the sent message included the reply text that I had composed, but the Original Message (the text that is automatically included below my signature when I reply to an email) that the email client included in the reply was NOT strongEmail A/strong. It was a bizarre combination of strongEmail A/strong and a separate message, strongEmail B/strong, which happened to be the most recent email I had received. To illustrate, here is what the situation looked like:  hr/  h1EMAIL A/h1  From: strongPerson A/strongbr Sent: Wednesday, June 1, 2016 12:00 PM strong(Date/Time A)/strongbr To: Mebr Subject: strongSubject A/strong  em"Message Text A"/em  strongPERSON A/strong's SIGNATURE  h1EMAIL B/h1  em(Completely unrelated to strongEmail A/strong)/embr From: strongPerson B/strongbr Sent: Wednesday, June 1, 2016 12:10 PM strong(Date/Time B)/strongbr To: Mebr Subject: strongSubject B/strong    em"Message Text B"/em  strongPERSON B/strong's SIGNATURE    h1EMAIL C/h1  em(My email in reply to strongEmail A/strongâ€”this should have only included data from strongEmail A/strong)/embr From: Mebr Sent: Wednesday, June 1, 2016 12:15 PM (Date/Time C)br To: strongPerson A/strongbr Subject: Re: strongSubject A/strong em"Message Text C"/em MY SIGNATUREbr em[Auto-populated reply header:]/em On Jun 1, 2016, at 12:10 PM strong(Date/Time B)/strong, strongPerson A/strong wrote: emstrong"Message Text B"/em/strong  hr/  I'm baffled by what could have caused this. As you can imagine, this caused some miscommunication, including some severe privacy concerns, and I cannot have this happen again.  It seems like when the email client was preparing Email C for me to enter my reply, it may have somehow linked Email B to Email A. Any ideas on what could have caused this, or what may have happened?  <answer257853> I had this same issue and it turned out to be related the the "threading" of conversations. Turns out it was grouping everything with the same subject and grabbing a random one to reply to. Turn off threading and conversation grouping in settings and this problem went away.
