Can I enlarge a RAID10 with Disk Utility? <body> I have a 4TB RAID10 (4x2TB disks) created with Disk Utility. I also have 4x4TB spare disks.  Can I enlarge the RAID10 to 8TB (4x4TB)?  This post suggests that I can break each mirrored set, and replace each of the 2TB disks with 4TB, one by one, and end up with 2 mirrored sets of 8TB each.  But is there any way to enlarge the STRIPED set of mirrored sets?  I've also considered RAID5, but am scared of the "write hole" data rot issue. But I have the machine on a battery backup, so is this an issue?
