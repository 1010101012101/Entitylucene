Are rc.shutdown and rc.shutdown.local still usable on OS X Lion? <body> Are either of coderc.shutdown/code or coderc.shutdown.local/code still being use in OS X, or have they been replaced with something else?    I realize that codelaunchd/code is replacing most of this, but I thought you could still use coderc.shutdown.local/code to run a script.    I couldn't even find rc.shutdown anywhere on my system.  <answer41701> I have no idea, really. There is a mention of code/etc/rc.shutdown.local/code in code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.SystemStarter.plist/code, but I am not at all sure what it means. The manual page for codeSystemStarter/code is not a great help, beyond informing us that it is deprecated. The program is running on my system, though. Oh, and the string code/etc/rc.shutdown.local/code is found inside the codeSystemStarter/code binary as well. My guess is that files there will be run at shutdown.   But if I may answer your implicit question of how to run something at shutdown: Here is what I have done. First, I wrote and compiled this little C program. What it does is simply to sleep until it receives a SIGTERM, at which point it exec's its arguments:  precode#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;signal.h&gt;  char **args;  void sigterm(int s) {   execvp(args[1],args+1);   fprintf(stderr, "%s: exec failed: ", args[0]);   perror(args[1]);   exit(1); }  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {   args=argv;   signal(SIGTERM,sigterm);   for (;;) sleep(0x7FFFFFFF); } /code/pre  I have a launch daemon set up to run this program at startup. Come shutdown time, codelaunchd/code will send the SIGTERM that causes the program to do its thing. Of course, it has to do so fairly quickly, or codelaunchd/code will apply a bigger sledgehammer.  Here is my codelaunchctl/code plist, named codeno.ntnu.math.hanche.quietboot.plist/code and placed in code/Library/LaunchDaemons//code. Its sole purpose is to run `nvram SystemAdioVolume=%01' at shutdown, so I can reboot without the chime.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;no.ntnu.math.hanche.quietboot&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/local/bin/atshutdown&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/sbin/nvram&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;SystemAudioVolume=%01&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  <comment47305> That's really cool :-). +1.  I'm really looking for info on those files though, because I'm trying to get a better understanding of what happened to those files and if they still work. Some people use rc.shutdown.local, and it's in a lot of tutorials and I want to know if I can still apply those to lion. <comment47306> There is a mention of `/etc/rc.shutdown.local` in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.SystemStarter.plist`, but I am not at all sure what it means.
