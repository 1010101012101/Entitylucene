Using Spotlight index on a file share on Server.app <body> I have a Mac mini server (Server.app 5.0.15 on El Capitan 10.11.2), and that connects to a file share on another Mac mini, also with El Capitan 10.11.2.  Spotlight indexes for the file shares are emnot/em available on the client, so I can't do efficient searches on the file shares.  What should be done to enable file share indexes, and where:  ul lion the server El Capitan?/li lion Server.app?/li lion the client?/li /ul  I have seen lots of discussions about successful mdutil trickery, but all are with OS X before 10.11 and Server.app before 5.0.15. My research of Apple Server Help seems to be absolutely quiet about spotlight or indexing.  What can I do have the Mac mini client index the share on another Mac that runs Server.app?  <answer295730> It looks like codemdutil/code can see that server search is enabled:  precode$ sudo mdutil -s /Volumes/YourNetworkDrive   /Volumes/YourNetworkDrive:            Server search enabled. /code/pre  Also the codemdutil/code manpage has this information for the code-p/code option:  precode-p  Spotlight caches indexes of some network devices locally.  This option requests that a local caches be flushed to the appropriate network device. /code/pre  However, for me this does not seem to work, and it doesn't show remote search results anywhere when using SMB network mounts (This is in macOS Sierra).  There is one officially supported way to query remote Spotlight indexes, by using the Apple Remote Desktop application. Apple Remote Desktop is not free, but can be purchased through the Mac App Store ($79.99).  However, this a separate app and it does not integrate the remote index with local Spotlight searches. It works well though.  From the features page:     strongRemote Spotlight search/strong       Leveraging the revolutionary Spotlight technology in OS X, the Remote   Spotlight capability in Apple Remote Desktop can perform   lightning-fast searches on remote client systems. Summary results for   each client are updated instantly as results are returned. View   details on results, or refine searches even further using additional   qualifiers. Results can be viewed on remote client systems, copied   back to your administrator system, or deleted.
