Disable shrinking spaces bar in El Capitan <body> I can't find a single piece of information about my issue. Is it possible to disable the 'feature' that the spaces bar reveals the content only if I hover with the mouse on it? It drives me nuts and I want the spaces bar to act like with the Yosemite update.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4VJoh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I want less space for the windows and more space for images of each virtual desktop by default.  <answer209711> I find this strongextremely/strong annoying. I the closest fix I have found was TotalSpaces2, it's a paid app the manages your spaces. I would emreally/em recommend sending feedback to Apple  <answer210597> I made a utility for accomplishing this very thing. If you don't mind that it injects code into the Dock and requires disabling one part of System Integrity Protection, then give it a whirl:  https://github.com/briankendall/forceFullDesktopBar  That github page includes a release and installation instructions.  <comment252948> What is a "shrinking spaces bar"? <comment252952> @user3439894 When you're in Mission Control, the bar at the top contains the different spaces/desktops you've set up. In El Capitan you don't see the different spaces until you hover the bar, which is annoying. <comment254186> Yet another great use of mach_injection code by "the wolf" @rentzsch <comment257017> Also, if you have 9 spaces not all are shown, the rightmost is hidden and you have to right scroll to it!  Usability == 0 <comment260863> Agree! I also would like spaces maximized by default.
