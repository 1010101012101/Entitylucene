Using an iPhone 5 (Verizon version) in Europe and India? <body> I am going to try and consolidate all of the questions I have here:  ol liCan I use the Verizon iPhone5 with a GSM carrier in Europe (Vodafone) and in India (Airtel or Aircel) with both calling and cellular data working properly?/li liQuestion 1 extended: Could I use it on the GSM carriers whilst on a 2 yr contract with Verizon? (The way I understand, it does come unlocked??)/li liOn ending my contract will I be able to pop in a t-mobile sim and use it in the US?/li /ol  Please advise  <answer66154> ol liYes./li liYes./li liYes./li /ol  Only quirk is you won’t get LTE data on networks other than Verizon, especially Airtel and Aircel, as Asian carriers use different bands. You are emprobably/em gonna get LTE in Europe, and that too most likely on CDMA networks, but you will have to check with the carrier. I really hate this fragmentation.  <comment77794> We try not to combine multiple questions into one here, for future reference. <comment77798> @Samuel I apologize. The only reason I consolidated was due to how closely the questions tied into each other. <comment77799> I think it's fine with one and two, but three would be a separate question. It's fine here, since you've already gotten an answer, but it's something to keep in mind for the future: it makes answering questions so much easier. <comment77800> Thanks! I share your sentiments on that last line of yours. I am assuming then, that LTE is the only global issue. I would still be able to use 3G or HSPA globally right? <comment77801> Thanks for the pointer! Appreciate it. <comment77803> Yes, 3G on CDMA and GSM. Probably 3.5G or 3G+ or 4G (whatever) too, but that too is fragmented, though less than LTE. <comment77807> Thanks again! Here is something I found:  http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/verizon-iphone-5-unlocked-att-t-mobile-video/ <comment77811> Yeah, that’s awesome too. I feel that the Verizon phone is the true “global” phone. It at least supports very basic standards like EDGE all over the world. <comment77820> I would buy the Verizon version in a heart beat, but the only let down is the lack of simultaneous voice and data on LTE :( <comment77824> Yeah that’s a problem, but LTE on CDMA simply doesn’t support it without a third (!!) antenna. <comment77832> Tough luck huh!
