random shutdown? (logfiles included) <body> My iMac (OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 newly installed on 27.11.2015) keeps shutting down randomly and restarting for about one and a half month now. Sometimes it even shuts down during the restart caused by the last random shutdown.   After the restart there is no popup saying it restarted after a problem or something like this. Sometimes it shuts down after a few minutes, sometimes it runs smoothly for some hours.   I had the hardware checked at a local store, but there was no hardware issue found.  They did a system analysis and allegedly couldn't reproduce the error, and only installed El Capitan (before I had Maverick, the shutdowns occured there also).  For the last shutdown I was able to save the logs:  hr  precodeTime                   Bundle ID                  Status    Comment 0.000                          -                       -    TALagent         Started (system uptime: 40.71 sec, current time: 470496758.81) 0.004                          -                       -    Liveness: 0      -&gt;

Please feel free to ask more questions if you need additional information. I appreciate any tips or help!  <comment262964> When you restart or shutdown your Mac normally, is the "Reopen windows when logging back in" checkbox checked in the pop-up window? Likewise, in `System Preferences  General` is the "Close windows when quitting an app" checkbox unchecked? I suggest unchecking the pop-up window at restart/shutdown time, and checking the "Close windows..."  in `System Preferences` and see if the problem goes away. (BTW/ I did get a chuckle out of the error message: `Exiting out of boredom`.) <comment263214> Thanks for your hint. I just tried it and no shutdown happend yet. So I will continue and observe the behaviour.
