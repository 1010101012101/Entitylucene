Show Results of Automator-Terminal command <body> strongTL;DR/strong If I create a .app via Automator, how can I show results of a shell script in a dialog or terminal window?  I am using Automator to run a shell script   precodeadb install /Directory/$1.apk /code/pre  and if I run it via Automator, I can see the results (install successful or can't find filname.apk or whatever else terminal would tell me). If I save as app and double click to run, then I do not get to see these results.  What can I do to show a dialog or terminal window that would display the results of the script I run?  <answer116824> There are a couple of ways you could do this:  ul liAdding an strongAsk for Confirmation/strong action after the strongRun Shell Script/strong one and using code$1/code in the emmessage/em field. /li liAdding another strongRun Shell Script/strong and executing codeosascript -e  'tell app "System Events" to display dialog "$1"'/code. You'll have to select strongas argument/strong on the empass input/em drop down./li /ul  <answer192632> If you only have stronga few lines of output/strong, you'd want to assign it to a variable and then display a confirmation dialog showing the output.  ol liadd Action "Set Value of Variable"/li lienter a new variable, e.g. codeoutput/code/li liadd Action "Ask for Confirmation"/li liin the message field, enter the variable name declared above. While typing the variable name, Automator will suggest to complete the variable name. Accept by pressing Enter key. This prevents Automator from interpreting the variable name as a plain text message./li /ol  This will look like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gy64e.png" alt="Automator with text output"  NB: I also tried the code$1/code approach, but did not succeed.  If you have stronga lot of lines of output/strong, you should direct all output into a new TextEdit document. To do so, just add the "New TextEdit Document" Action after your script action.  This may look like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9x3kG.png" alt="New Text Edit document action"  strongHint:/strong diagnostic messages are often output to standard error. To also collect text send to standard error, add codeexec 2&gt;&amp;1/code at the top of your bash script.  <comment136601> It just displays `$1` with either of those methods. <comment136622> @Jakar I've tested it having the first **Run Shell Script** action doing `echo something` and it definitely works. Perhaps you're Script is not returning something? <comment136636> Okay. I'm thinking it may have something to do with `adb` (part of Android developer SDK), because there is output in Terminal after I run that command, but not via the automator script. <comment257373> Slight modification to handle the string interpolation osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to display dialog "'"$1"'"' <comment270169> wow exactly what I needed ! <comment273823> this solution worked for me whereas the accepted version did not <comment345289> this was really useful to me and explained why I couldn't get the value of the output. great job
