Where can i find and clean up partially downloaded content? <body> Say your download of 17gb application is interrupted and can't continue since you are out of space.  Knowing the application name, where can you look to find parts of what has already been downloaded so you can remove it?  <answer94746> Downloads, finished or not, will be in your Downloads folder in your User Directory. Unless you have specified that Safari save them somewhere else: bad idea. Ceetainly not to the desktop, as so many people think.  In the General pane of Safari preferences, you will find the setting for what folder to save to ... and in answer to your other question, you can choose whether Safari is to remove incomplete downloads: manually, never, or when successfully downloaded.   The option to Open "safe" files after downloading is way unnecessary, uncheck that only if you're experienced with security measures.  BUT, I think you're confused about downloading vs. installing. Two separate processes. Downloaded filed or zips or disk images can sit there forever. If you're asking how to fully uninstall an installed application, please ask a new question.  <answer94759> The temporary location that stores downloading files varies between computers. Here's how to find it:  ol liStart a rather large app store download/li liOpen Activity monitor, and select the codestoredownloadd/code process. (codestoreagent/code for 10.9 and below)/li liOpen the Inspector (press the "i" button, or kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdi/kbd)/li liSelect the codeOpen Files and Ports/code tab, and scroll to the bottom/li liSelect the path that starts with code/private/var/folders/code that contains codecom.apple.appstore/code from the beginning, up to and including codecom.apple.appstore/code /li liOpen Terminal and type codeopen [paste path here]/code and hit kbdreturn/kbd/li liFrom here, you can see all the temporary files the Mac App Store has made. You can get info on each one to see their sizes, and dispose of them accordingly./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cuzVF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer245161> Here's another way to find the Mac App Store downloads folder by enabling the debug menu:  ol liQuit the App Store/li liOpen Terminal/li liRun command: codedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true/code/li liOpen the App Store/li liSelect the new "Debug" menu in the menu bar and choose "Show Download Folder..."/li /ol  Demo: https://gfycat.com/KindLimpBarracuda  <answer265096> There is a very simple method to find downloaded .dmg files, when you wish to clean up or reuse or archive some .dmg file. This applies not only to App Store downloaded .dmg's but also to many other software downloaded using a .dmg file.  ol liChoose Finder menu "Go - Go to Folder..." and enter /private/var/li liOnce the window of this normally hidden folder is open use the search box, by default in the top right corner of the window, and enter there '.dmg' (without the quotes)/li liYou get a list of all .dmg files that are currently in that temporary directory. If your Finder view preferences show the Path Bar, you see on the bottom of the window in the path bar for every selected .dmg file immediately the folder where the wanted .dmg resides. To activate the path bar choose Finder menu "View - Show Path Bar"./li /ol  Above method is straightforward and requires nothing else than ordinary Finder functionality.  BTW, the involved folders store these files only temporary. If your only motivation is to get rid of a large downloaded file, then a restart suffices to clean out these files.  <comment111064> Apps are usually directly downloaded in the Applications Folder. Have you tried looking there? <comment111066> Apps are not directly downloaded to the Applications folder ... unless you mean Installed. Maybe clarify? <comment111079> The question pertains to files downloaded via the Mac App store, as indicated in the question's tags <comment111080> The icon seen in the application's folder is only a place holder, that is replaced upon completion of the download. (you can try opening it's package's contents and see for yourself). <comment111081> If you're looking to save disk space, have you tried deleting foreign language packs and old PowerPC copies of app binaries? They can easily add up to over 1-2GB <comment302236> I tried this option but the debug menu do not appear. <comment302529> That's strange, I'm on 10.11.5 and was just able to disable and re-enable the debug menu with this command. <comment306112> 2. on yosemite and above the process name is `storedownloadd` <comment306115> @jerrymouse I'm on mobile right now. Could you suggest an edit to my answer, please? <comment314922> @Rene You need to restart App Store. <comment372324> Didn't appear on 10.12.6
