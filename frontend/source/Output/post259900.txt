Windows 7 installer wont boot after creating partition for Bootcamp <body> I'm trying to install Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro (13 inch Mid 2012) running OS X 10.7.5 I'm using a USB drive to create the boot disk, and I also downloaded the drivers needed from the apple website.  After creating the partition and restarting, the system tells me that there is no bootable drive available. I try holding the option key and then selecting the windows partition and then it shows the same screen.   Any ideas of what's wrong?  <answer259904> Common Problem when installing bootcamp windows  Causes: br Failed to detect USB3.0 drive after reboot  Solution:br Use a strongUSB2.0/strong drive to create windows install disk instead of USB 3.0 drives.  <answer259920> I had the same issue with my iMac 2011. Your MacBook Pro won't boot from your USB stick because it has a Superdrive and only accepts alternative booting from there. Either use Windows install DVD or disconnect the Superdrive manually. Lots of tutorials on youtube how to do that.  <comment325277> This is completely incorrect.  Intel based Macs could boot from Macs that had 10.4.5 or later (roughly 2006).  However, the boot medium must be formatted GUID.  Please refer to this [support document](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201663)
