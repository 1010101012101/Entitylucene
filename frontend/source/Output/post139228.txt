Is it possible to recover current texts after restoring from an old backup? <body> I restored my iphone 4s from a 1/2/2013 backup. Looks like I lost everything that was current like texts. Can I get it back to the state it was in before I restored it from that 2013 backup?  <answer139245> Only if you have a more recent backup.  Do you have iCloud Backup set up on the phone? If so, you most likely have a more recent backup on iCloud.  <comment164194> PLEASE HELP. THX
