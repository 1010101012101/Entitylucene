iTunes home sharing playback position when streaming to iOS device <body> I am using a codeMac mini/code as a home theater streaming computer, with codeHome Sharing in iTunes/code to view the movies in my codeiTunes/code library either on my codeApple TV/code or my codeiOS devices/code.  In cases where I do not finish the movie, the codeApple TV/code works great - it updates the playback position and the next time I start it it automatically starts where I left off.  The problem is the codeiOS devices/code. When I view the movie using the shared section of the movie player it starts where I left off (from the codeApple TV/code) but it does not update the playback position when I stop watching on the codeiOS device/code (so resuming from that point does not work).  strongAn example:/strongbr If I am watching a movie on the codeApple TV/code, stop at the 30 min mark and then I start to watch it on the codeiOS device/code, it works fine and starts at the 30 min mark. Say I then watch 15 more min on the codeiOS device/code and stop. When I resume watching the movie again it starts at the 30 min mark and not at the 45 min mark. I have looked every for an answer and not found one. I would appreciate any ideas.  <comment121114> Home Sharing sometimes has intermittent issues. Have you tried logging out of Home Sharing on the iOS devices and logging back in? From Settings  Music  Home Sharing - tap on the Apple ID, sign out and then sign back in.
