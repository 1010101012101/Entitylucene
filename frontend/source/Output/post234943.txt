How can I display the SSID I am connected to in the Menu extensions area? <body> I'd like to also display the SSID I am currently connected to next to the WiFi signal strength indicator.  Running El Capitan (10.11.4)  <answer234946> There's no built-in way to show the wifi SSID in the menu bar.  However, you do have a few other options.  You can buy a 3rd-party application like Bartender 2 that allows you to move items around and show/hide icons.  While not exactly what you're looking for it does supply some more detailed level of customization.  Or, you can strongoption+click/strong the wifi icon to see a dropdown menu of additional info, including the SSID name.  <answer234947> The best solution I use for adding the SSID to the menu bar is turning off Apple's menu item and using WiFi Signal app from Adrian Granados:  ul lihttps://www.adriangranados.com/?q=apps/wifi-signal/li lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wifi-signal/id525912054?mt=12/li /ul  It's much fuller featured than just displaying the SSID, but it does that job nicely. I am a very satisfied customer of all his Mac apps as they are powerful, well engineered and updated regularly.  <answer235503> The most configurable menubar display app I'm aware of right now is TextBar ($2.99 U.S.).  http://www.richsomerfield.com/apps/  <answer284671> You can do this with Hammerspoon (see http://hammerspoon.org) and a bit of lua. Add the following to Hammerspoon's config file. Don't forget to save and do 'reload config' from the Hammerspoon menu bar icon:  precodewifiMenu = hs.menubar.newWithPriority(2147483645) wifiMenu:setTitle(hs.wifi.currentNetwork())  wifiWatcher = nil  function ssidChanged()     local wifiName = hs.wifi.currentNetwork()     if wifiName then         wifiMenu:setTitle(wifiName)     else          wifiMenu:setTitle("Wifi OFF")     end end  wifiWatcher = hs.wifi.watcher.new(ssidChanged):start() /code/pre  Haven't tested it on Sierra, but works nicely on 10.11.6.  <comment287563> Appreciate the response but if I have to click anywhere I may as well just leave it as is. The net issue is I have two SSIDs, a work and personal one. Personal one is fast, work one I need for exchange :( so if doing a large code build pulling artifacts it's nice to see at a glance which ssid I'm on before realising "why is this still running? I went for a coffee and everything" :) I can't script it even with an alias to my toolchain as often I am coding in a VM. <comment288327> Thanks for the recommendation. :-)
