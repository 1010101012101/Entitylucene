OS X - How to disable the opening file animation? <body> Does anyone know of a way to disable this animation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XqEI4.gif" alt="open file animation"  I recall being able to in previous iterations of OS X.  <answer134635> You can disable all animation in Finder with:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder DisableAllAnimations -bool true &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Finder /code/pre  I don't recall a preference just for this animation though.  <comment159518> I'm afraid that doesn't disable it. <comment159520> @user46751 Which version of OS X are you using? <comment159671> OS X version 10.9.3
