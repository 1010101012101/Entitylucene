On the iPad, how do I tell what version of Mobile Safari I have? <body> I'd like to know what precise version of Mobile Safari the iPad I'm using has. Is there any way to find out (preferably from the device itself)? There doesn't seem to be any menu in Safari Mobile, and thus none to choose "About" from. If you go to Settings | Safari, you see various useful things, but no "About" or "Version" or similar, which surprised me.  <answer30722> sThe only way I've found/s Ross McNab's way emwas/em much better but sadly no longer works (thanks, Apple); Billy Moon's way works but is a bit awkward for one-off checks.  Another way to do this is to use an external website (there are plenty to choose from, just search on "what's my browser"), which will report my codeuser-agent/code string back to me.  So for instance, these sites will report back to me that my codeuser-agent/code string is:  preMozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 4_3_5 like Mac OS X; en-gb) AppleWebKit/533.17.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.2 Mobile/8L1 Safari/6533.18.5/pre  ...from which I can tell that I'm using Mobile Safari 5.0.2.  <answer90899> You can visit http://spiderip.com to check the user agent and version of safari   <answer122384> You can get the userAgent string without visiting an external website, by typing the following in the Safari address bar (where you would normally type a URL):  codejavascript:alert(navigator.userAgent)/code  You must type it exactly as it appears here, matching case and punctuation.  An alert popup will appear with the full useragent string, which contains the version number of Safari and iOS.  <answer157476> Handy alternative if you want to copy paste this info / you're already there: plug your iPad into your mac (assuming platform!) and in OSX Safari, remote debug the device, and copy the User Agent from the Resource Panel under Request Headers.  Enable remote debugging:  ul liIn OSX Safariâ€™s Preferences pane under Advanced, check the Show Develop menu in the menu bar checkbox./li liOn iDevice: Settings  Safari  Advanced/li /ul  http://moduscreate.com/enable-remote-web-inspector-in-ios-6/  <answer169317> None of the javascript answers worked for me. I found an easier way! There are several "what's my IP address?" pages out there, such as this one. These pages tell you your IP address and, in some cases, what your browser is, what your operating system is, and if your browser is up to date.  <answer175201> Since Ross McNab's answer appears to no longer work...  Bookmark this (or any) page - then edit the bookmark - call it what you like, but change the url to...  precodejavascript:alert(navigator.userAgent) /code/pre  Now you can check your user agent any time you feel like conveniently from your bookmarks - thanks Apple!  Or if it's just a quick one-off check you want and you're connected to the 'net, do what T.J. originally posted.  <answer274589> iOS users (like iPad, iPhone, iPod touch) can view strongSafari/strong and strongWebKit/strong versions by visiting "What is my user agent"  <comment35303> For example: http://show-ip.net/browserinfo/ <comment35305> I didn't even realize you were answering your own question, but to confirm: yes that would be the only way. You could condense a list of iOS versions and installed Mobile Safari and use that for reference, if no one else has done it already... <comment35348> @T.J.Crowder, you should probably accept your own answer - it's the best way of doing what you asked. <comment35371> +1 good question. Apparently Safari does not support any of the about: pages http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About_URI_scheme <comment106719> Could you explain why this works, not just a link. Just goiving a link makes me think of viruses and trojans etc. <comment142827> What. Was. I. Thinking? Of course, the `javascript:` pseudo-protocol and `navigator.userAgent`. <comment142828> @Thilo: But we should be kicking ourselves; it does, of course, support the `javascript:` pseudo-protocol. See Ross's answer. Doh!! <comment144795> This works because on every request the browser send this information to the webserver. But usually you just do not see this and this webpage just "reflects" the information passed via the request. <comment198870> *"None of the javascript answers worked for me"* Huh? `javascript:alert(navigator.userAgent)` definitely works. <comment206419> @T.J.Crowder that js solution does not work for me on Mobile Safari 8 on iOS 8.1 - get `Safari cannot run the script because JavaScript is not allowed to be used this way.` but if I save a bookmark, and then edit the bookmark with that js solution, it works. <comment206420> @BillyMoon: And sadly, I can confirm this on iOS 8.1.2, apparently they've disallowed it. I suggest posting your bookmark workaround as an answer. <comment206421> Sadly, this has stopped working, as [noted by Billy Moon](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30721/on-the-ipad-how-do-i-tell-what-version-of-mobile-safari-i-have/169317?noredirect=1#comment206419_169317). Nowadays you have to create a bookmark, go back and edit it to change the location to the `javascript:alert(navigator.userAgent)` bit, and then follow the bookmark -- *that* still works. <comment208644> @Ross : I'm getting 'Cannot Run Script: Safari cant run the script because JavaScript is not alloed to be used this way' message..working on iOS 8.1.2 iPad mini <comment304862> Thanks for this. It took me a while to figure the Resource Panel is on the right edge of the screen (not the Resources tab). <comment304888> upvotes = love :) <comment304955> Unfortunately, I still didn't get any precise versions this way. Just iOS 9.3.2 which I knew anyways. So while I enjoyed your answer, I'm not necessarily recommending it to others. Hope you understand. ,o <comment358297> They can no longer, I'm afraid, since the given url now redirects to a whois query service. Use the link in John's answer instead or choose the bookmarked JS call as shown by TJ Crowder.
