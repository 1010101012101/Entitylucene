"pkd" process on El Capitan <body> I just upgraded to OS X 10.11.2 (El Cap), and overall it seems to be working OK.  One strange thing: there's a "pkd" process which is taking ~150% CPU, all the time, even though I'm not doing anything.  (At first I thought it might have something to do with Spotlight reindexing or something, but 12 hours later it's still going.)  What is it?  Can I stop it?  <answer220923> The manpage says:  precodeNAME  pkd -- management and supervision daemon for plug-in services  SYNOPSIS  pkd [-v]  DESCRIPTION  pkd manages plug-ins for the PlugInKit subsystem. It is a classic launch  agent managed by launchd. /code/pre  Sounds pretty safe to kill it off, by opening a terminal and running:  precodelaunchctl stop com.apple.pluginkit.pkd /code/pre  It should restart itself whenever it's required (possibly immediately).  <answer244203> I uninstalled all plug-ins to my Safari and that cured the problem.......very annoying process  <answer252277> If you use the Roboform plug-in with Safari, you might be having a known issue with CPU usage that can be fixed only by removing it.  More info: https://discussions.apple.com/message/30212342#message30212342  <comment267461> I tried what seemed like a safer approach: `launchctl stop com.apple.pluginkit.pkd && launchctl start com.apple.pluginkit.pkd`.  My CPU usage went down a lot, and everything seems fine still. <comment292230> I've found that running `App Tamer` and setting it to a 1% processor limitation is a safer and more easily monitorable solution vs altering things permanently. <comment300902> Please could you edit your answer to mention which Safari plug-ins you had. This may help others better isolate the cause of the problem. <comment354902> It just restarts directly after killing it off, and returns with CPU usage of 100% with me. There has to be a better fix for this than just killing it off? Edit: I just figured out I'm running Cold Turkey, which might be the culprit. Can't kill that program until 15:30, so will try it out at that time.
