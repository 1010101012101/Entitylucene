Time Machine cannot locate external disk <body> I have an strongiMac11,2/strong running strongMacOS 10.8.5/strong. Time Machine (TM) has made backup on a LaCie 320GB Firewire400 HDD for almost 2 years now. It stopped working 2 weeks ago, stuck on 'looking for drive'. My HDD is full, but I am quite sure it already deleted older backups successfully. I tried:  ul lito connect a new external HDD (Seagate 2TB with USB cover) and switch TM to this, formatted in MacOS extended,journalized (no encryption);/li lito turn off TM, delete code/System/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code, turn on TM, reselect my disk; once again rebooting before turning on TM;/li lientered StarWars mode, copied codecom.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code from my last working backup to my internal HDD;/li licopied codeBackups.backupdb/code from the 320GB to the 2TB disk; I can enter StarWars mode and browse, but still the infinite 'looking for drive' message/li lichecked the drive permissions: 320GB's codeBackups.backupdb/code is codedrwxr-xr-x+ root:staff/code. 2TB is similar due to the copy. I am currently changing the 2TB's codeBackups.backupdb/code persmissions to codedrwxrwxr-x+ root:staff/code recursively, sbut it takes some time, I will post the result later/s. Took the night to do that, still no luck./li /ul  Any ideas?  <answer156493> Eventually upgraded from 10.8 to 10.10 (Apple having removed 10.9 from AppStore...). And Time Machine is now up and running. I'll never know what happened.  <comment181865> It is unclear exactly what you are asking. I would start by using `Disk Utility` to look at what is on your old HD. Assuming this is OK you should be able to copy to another HD. <comment181868> To clarify my comment above I suggest copying the partition. There are a number of hidden files in addition to Backups.backupdb <comment181937> @Milliways I can try that, but if the partition was corrupted, I will recopy the corruption... What I wanna try: erase the original 320GB and start over TM on it. If fails, upgrade to Maverick, maybe TM's settings get renewed? <comment182027> `Disk Utility` has options to Verify and Repair partitions <comment182052> verify found nothing wrong. Repaired anyway, no improvement
