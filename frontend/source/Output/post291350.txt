MacBook Pro sending currents into me? <body> I have a MackBook Pro from several years ago. I have been in France the past few weeks, and I have been using a non-grounded adapter to a 3-slot extension to charge my devices. I was using this and felt the current vibration when it was plugged in and didn't think anything of it. Then I also had a personal adapter which broke, and after attempting to fix it, when I plugged into my computer it didn't work but when I touched the computer it shocked me. I have since thrown that away and I am back to using our family strip. Things charge normally on my computer, but i fear I may have broken the battery or something because every time I touch it, it seems to send a current through me causing a headache and anxiety. My question is, is this possible? Could there be a problem with the battery or am I imagining things?  <comment367838> Use a grounded adaptor and then see whether you have the same issue - Apple supply a grounded cable so you should match the original.
