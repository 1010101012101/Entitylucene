Check disk usage and the growth history <body> Today I received a message saying there is only 18 GB left.  In the last few days I don't think I used so much space in the disk.  Is there some way to check the disk usage history? In a way to see how much disk was consumed in the last day/week/month.  <answer264581> I suggest you to use the DaisyDisk application (a free trial is also available -- see the link).  This app help you to find out how you are using the space and so you can identify what is occupying a large amount of space in your HD. It does not provide a historical record, so unless you are using a tool and logging that information, you might have to focus on what's present now rather than looking back.  <comment332495> There used to be a daily cronjob with output in Console for that, not sure if OS still has that. Last time I looked at that was in Leopard.
