How to switch between output window and code editor in Xcode <body> I tried google'ing around and I could not find the shortcut that can send me to the "output window(if that's what it's called)" after telling my program to compile and run. Also, how would I switch back to my code editor from that output window?  I've done it before, but I forgot it.   Thank you  <answer148243> Command+Shift+Y. It is a toggle shortcut which opens and closes output in Xcode.  <answer148245> It is a little unclear what you really mean:  The Output pane is called the Console. It is displayed in the Debug area.  There are a few ways to get to it.  In the Toolbar Menu:  Use the Debug area toggle button.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FZe2O.png" alt="enter image description here"  From the Menu Bar : View Menu :- Debug area :- emShow the Debug area/em menu to open the strongDebug/strong area set as it was last displayed  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mmpuL.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6NvL1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note the shortcut for this: kbd cmd/kbd + kbd shift/kbd +  kbd Y/kbd  Use View Menu :- Debug area :- Activate strongConsole/strong area to Show the strongDebug/strong area with the strongConsole/strong showing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/epkvz.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhsQ4.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Note the shortcut for this: kbd cmd/kbd + kbd shift/kbd +  kbd C/kbd  Or just show the strongConsole/strong area if the debug area is already showing.  You can also use the strongDebug/strong area show hide toggle to show/hide either the Variable View or the  Console area  view  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/23REf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment174695> Cmd+Shift+Y only opens or closes the Debug area. <comment174716> @markhunte : I thought he only asking about the debug area ! . U explain it awesomely. <comment174774> Whoa thanks for doing all that. Cmd+Shift+c was the command I was looking for. It switches me into the active console while the program is running and waiting for my input. Now just wondering, if I wanted to edit my code, but I'm in the active console area, do you how to switch back?  Thank you!
