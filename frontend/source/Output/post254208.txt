Mac Mini RAM Full <body> Have a problematic Mac Mini that keeps showing the error "Memory Full". I have it running a slideshow in Keynote 24/7. I'm Wondering how to fix this.   The Mac Mini has 8 GB of RAM so this shouldn't be a problem. It is running the latest version of Keynote and macOS. I end up doing this twice a day.  <answer254236> Look in Activity Monitor under the Memory tab (sort by the Memory column) to see what's using up so much memory. You can also try something like:  precodetop -o vsize /code/pre  Which will sort by the total memory size, according to the man page.  <comment316454> It's going to be impossible to help you without seeing the errors being produced.  Just saying 'I have 8gb RAM so I should be ok' doesn't help, the machine is running out of RAM so you should believe it :-). <comment316459> also, 8GB RAM is pretty much bare minimum these days. <comment316555> Ok. Will try monday at work.
