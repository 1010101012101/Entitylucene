How to watch a 1080p video on retina display with a 1:1 pixel ratio (with no scaling up)? <body> I am trying to watch a 1080p video on my Macbook Retina 13 but it is scaled up to the 'scaled resolution' 1280x800. If the video is scaled down to 1280x800 before being displayed, I will be losing in precision. VLC for example claims to support Retina Displays but that seems to only concern the fonts and not the video.  <answer126331> You can't watch any full screen video that is not in the exact native display resolution without scaling. At least in my knowledge.  The question is - is the scaling good or not. You may try different players.  If you want pixel to pixel mapping, you can only set the player size to 100% of the video, and it'll show as one of the windows on the screen, depending on the video file resolution - but only that way will you have the pixel-accurate playback.  Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.  <answer225716> You can change scale option in System Preferences—›Displays. Maximum scaled down resolution for MBP Retina 13 is 1680x1050. It's not perfect solution — you still won't get accurate 1080p nor native 2560x1600, —  but it's definitely better than 1280x800.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NwrPh.jpg" alt="scale options"
