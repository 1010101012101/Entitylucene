How to batch combine mkv and srt files to mp4 with ffmpeg <body> I'm trying to get an applescript to combine .mkv's with .srt's after i added those files to  a folder.  I've managed to do the automatic conversion from mkv to mp4 and add them to itunes. The only thing that I cannot accomplish is to get the srt automatically.  I also can do this in the Terminal window, one "mkv" at a time. The command that is working fine for me to do this, is:  precodeffmpeg -i movie.1.mkv -sub_charenc WINDOWS-1252 -i movie.1.srt -vcodec copy -acodec copy -scodec mov_text -metadata:s:s:0 language=por movie.1.mp4 /code/pre  I have the mkv file with the same name as the srt file.  The apple script I'm using to do the batch conversion is:  precodeon adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items tell application "Finder"     set fold_name to the name of this_folder     try          repeat with i from 1 to number of items in added_items             set new_item to item i of added_items             set the item_path to the quoted form of the POSIX path of new_item              if name extension of new_item is "mkv" then                 do shell script " /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -i " &amp; item_path &amp; " -vcodec copy -acodec libfaac " &amp; item_path &amp; ".mp4"              else if name extension of new_item is "mp4" then                 tell application "iDentify"                     activate                     open new_item                 end tell              end if         end repeat     end try end tell end adding folder items to /code/pre  I'm a newbie in the applescript, and the thing why i don't get it to work is, that the script returns in the end a file called emmovie.1.mkv.mp4/em created from the emmovie.1.mkv/em.  That means that I'm not abble to get in the variable "item_path" only the filename without the extension. Perhaps it's very easy, but i didn't manage to do it.  Can anyone please help? Thank you  <answer126528> Using and adapting code from   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12907517/extracting-file-extensions-from-applescript-paths  Add to the top of your code:  precode-- overcome finder limitation... set text item delimiters to "." /code/pre  then later extract the name and extension portions...  precodeif new_item contains "." then set item_ext to (text item 2 of new_item) as text if new_item contains "." then set item_name to (text items 1 thru -2 of new_item) as text /code/pre  That should do it... :)  <comment164702> Thank you for your awnser.
