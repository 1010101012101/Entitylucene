Connecting iPhone 4 to MacBook Pro via Bluetooth <body> I'm having issues when trying to connect my new MacBook Pro to my iPhone 4 via Bluetooth. I'm trying to connect my iPhone to my MacBook so that I can use the iPhone as a hotspot through Bluetooth and not wi-fi or a cable.   Things I've done: I start off by clicking the Bluetooth icon, then go to "Set Up Bluetooth Device..." I then select my iPhone when it appears. The pairing popup comes up on my iPhone but it never does pair... I get a popup on my phone later on stating the MacBook Pro was not compatible.  What can be done to troubleshoot tethering over bluetooth?  <answer63583> Check out this post by @DanielSchlaug on the same subject: It certainly helped me (and a few other people).  Here's the content of Daniel's the answer:     This fixes what i presume to be a corrupt internet sharing preference file. It will also remove all other network settings such as wifi access-points and their passwords so keep that in mind.
