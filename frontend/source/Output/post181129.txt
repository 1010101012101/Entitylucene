When I run "networksetup -getdnsservers airport" in Terminal, it says There aren't any DNS Servers set on Wi-Fi <body> When I run the networksetup -getdnsservers airport command in terminal, it says There aren't any DNS Servers set on Wi-Fi.  I need my primary DNS to fix my NAT Type on Xbox One.  <answer288962> First run:  precodenetworksetup -listallhardwareports /code/pre  Look for the codeen0/code or codeen1/code for your WiFi under the Device:  Then run:  precodeipconfig getpacket en0 /code/pre  Of course if your Wi-Fi is codeen7/code, then you need that instead of codeen0/code above. The broadcast DNS and search suffix are provided as output to the above codeifconfig getpacket/code command towards the bottom of the options. If you don't get a packed in response to DHCP then you need to fix that on your network or log in to the router directly to retrieve the proper values.  <comment215354> DNS should be set in your router & relayed over wifi. The wifi should not be doing DHCP or NAT; you should leave those tasks to the router. Other than that, with so little information, it's impossible to say more. <comment215396> Does the DNS server show in the Network part of System Preferences? <comment215531> Yes but it's different from the DNS servers that show on my airport utility
