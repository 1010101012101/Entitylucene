Is there a USB trackpad <body> I would like to use a trackpad on a windows machine.   The catch is : I would like to use it through a KVM switch. Thus I cannot pair it by Bluetooth.   I am looking for a USB trackpad that I could plug on the switch, but couldn't find one.   Does it exist ?  I would prefer an original apple one, but if it doesn't exist, and the alternatives are good enough, that could do as well.   <answer278118> You can still use wireless, but it has to be devices that use the 2.4Ghz receivers like the Logitech Wireless Touchpad.  It uses the "Unifying Nano Receiver" that plugs into a USB port.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4lfips.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I've used many wireless Logitech mice on KVMs (mostly Avocent) and all worked flawlessly.  The touchpad should be no different though I haven't tested it out because I don't own a trackpad to test (I don't like them)
