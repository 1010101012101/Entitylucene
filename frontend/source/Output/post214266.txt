What's making this sound on my Mac? (DeliveryCompleted.aiff) <body> Several times a day, my laptop plays this unknown sound. There's no visual cue that goes along with it and I have no idea what it means.  I assume it wants my attention for something, but without knowing what, I'm stuck. On the other hand, if it's something I don't really need to know, then I want to make it stop.  I managed to track down a file on my system that has the sound...    precodeafplay "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Application Loader.app/Contents/Resources/DeliveryCompleted.aiff" /code/pre  Any ideas as to what that sound is supposed to mean?  <answer214283> This sound most likely has nothing to do with Xcode. It is a standard sound used throughout OS X for many purposes, including installer notifications. It is also a ringtone on iOS.  <answer214384> IIRC SoundBunny for Mac ($10, free 30-day demo available) will show you which apps have recently played sounds on your Mac.  <answer214681> Turns out it was Adium's way of telling me a new contact had signed on. I disabled the sound in Adium's preference and it's gone away.  <comment258696> Are you actively using Xcode? <comment258941> No, not actively using XCode. The only apps that are actually running in my dock are iTerm2, Chrome, Adium, Mail, and Slack. <comment258943> I wouldn't be surprised to find out it's an installer notification. I just turned off sounds from Application Loader in the Notifications settings, so I can see if that stops it. <comment259271> Nope, not an installer notification. :(
