VirtualBox VERR_ACCESS_DENIED <body> I am trying to install Windows 10 on a partition with this Virtualbox method, where I create a vmdk link to the partition and use it as the drive, run the installer and then reboot.  This worked fine on a device running Mavericks, but on one with El Capitan does not work, and prints out a codeVERR_ACCESS_DENIED/code  precodeVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ~/RawWinDisk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk0 -partitions 1,4 /code/pre  This is supposed to make the vmdk file. I did do a codechown/code to code/dev/disk0/code, strongdisk0s1/strong and strongdisk0s4/strong. I also tried a codechmod -R 777/code on them to see if it helped, but it still did not work. Running command as codesudo/code does not work either.  <answer217445> I think you may be hitting El Capitan's System Integrity Protection [SIP] which is preventing access..  Borrowed from How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA &quot;rootless&quot; on OS X 10.11, El Capitan? ...  Apple's documentation covers disabling SIP, About System Integrity Protection on your Mac.  An article on lifehacker.com lists these steps:     ol   liReboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appears on your screen./li   liClick Utilities  Terminal./li   liIn the Terminal window, type in codecsrutil disable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd./li   liRestart your Mac./li   /ol   <comment262785> guessing you hit SIP. Did you try with it off? <comment262786> @Tetsujin Please explain what SIP is. I didn't yet meet up with such term <comment262788> System Integrity Protection - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11 <comment262789> I'm trying to reproduce this on 5.0.10 r104061 - I don't seem to be wrapping my brain around why the Mac raw devices are being used by the guest OS. <comment262848> @Tetsujin Disabling SIP actually did work. Please put it in an answer so this question can be answered <comment262850> Ah, glad it helped - putting together a [rather short] answer  :)
