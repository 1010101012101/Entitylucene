No cap after a period in Dragon Dictate 4 <body> In Dragon Dictate 4, when I say "Hello world period this is a test period", it outputs:     Hello world. this is a test."   There is no cap after the first period. Is there any way to fix it?  This issue affects most programs: Evernote, the default Mac OS X mail application, Safari, Latexian, etc. There is no such issue using Dragon's notepad or Google Chrome.   Obviously I don't want to have to say "Cap" after each period.  <answer162372> Considering it's not happening in every application (it works in the built-in Notepad and Google Chrome), I would think it's a bug. Have you reported this behavior to Dragon?
