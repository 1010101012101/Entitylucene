iOS app to edit .txt files (w/ Dropbox sync) that preserves Windows-style line breaks <body> I commonly edit .txt files on my PC (Notepad) and my Mac (using TextEdit) and store them in Dropbox.  I would like also like to be able to edit these .txt files on my iOS devices.  Every app that I've tried breaks the Windows-style line breaks; if I edit a .txt file, all line breaks are lost when I open that file in Notepad.    Is there any iOS app which can edit .txt files and preserve Windows-style line breaks? (Paid is OK, but cheaper is better.)  I have tried iA Writer and Write 2.  <answer74852> Nebulous Notes and Elements both support windows newline characters.
