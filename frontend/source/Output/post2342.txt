HID Compliant TouchScreen for OS X 10.6 <body> Does anyone know of an HID-compliant touch screen that will work straight out of the box with Max OS X 10.6 without requiring any drivers to be installed?  <answer4940> Would you be happy with an HID-compliant touchscreen running another OS (or OS X with drivers installed), and then a full-screen VNC to your driver-less OS X machine? You might not be able to tell the difference.  <answer5162> Google found a couple of possibilities; I haven't tried them myself:  ul liNextWindow - Touchscreen 2700/li liPlanar Touch - Touchscreen LCD Monitor - PT1710mx 17" Monitor/li /ul  There's the Wacom Cintiq; while I believe they need drivers I'm sure they'd be available close to day &amp; date.  And an entirely different approach to take might be the Axiotron Modbook.  <comment5053> That's not an option sorry as we need to deploy ~300 machines with such a touch screen. <comment5147> Based on the lack of reply, maybe you should take a different approach. What is wrong with installing 300 drivers? <comment5182> The problem with installing a 3rd party driver is that it is something else that we need to maintain. Say if OS X updates and suddenly the driver doesn't work anymore, we will have to fix it on 300 machines. <comment5268> Thanks Dori, these screens look pretty good. We've actually written our own driver for a touch screen now, but if we don't use that then we will definitely check these out.
