PowerBook G4 (No Intel) running OS X 10.4.11 (Tiger) doesn't react to clicks from the touchpad or mouse ... <body> My PowerBook G4 (without Intel) running OS X 10.4.11 (Tiger) doesn't react to clicks from the touchpad or mouse ... any ideas why? and what to do? Is it a Software or Hardware issue? Don't have a OS X Tiger CD to reinstall. Did check what I could on SafeBoot, at some point it said that the HD seems functioning correctly.   Any solution for this? Any informed ideas would be greatly appreciate it. Thank you!   <answer189483> If you are using a USB mouse and the mac is still not responding to you, then its clearly a software issue. I would recommend you to using your installer disk and clean install the OS, this will surely fix the issue.  <comment224724> My laptop didn't arrived with an Installer CD ...  ):  Where could I find one? It's an old OS X 10.4.11 - Tiger <comment224727> @Hill You can install leopard on your G4. If you don't have a disk, no issues. Reboot and go to recovery (cmd+R) and use internet recovery option.
