AirDrop photo from iPhone to Macbook Pro says "waiting…" then "rejected" <body> What I'm doing:  ol liOpen Photos on iPhone (7 plus, iOS 10.2.0)/li liTap share icon/li liWait for my laptop identity to appear in AirDrop section/li liTap on my own face  (i.e., laptop identity)/li /ol  Result:  ul liMy face says, "Waiting…"/li liAfter what I assume is a timeout delay, my face says, "Declined"/li /ul  The MacBook Pro has codeAllow me to be discovered by:/code set to codeEveryone/code. The top Google search results seem to suggest logging out of iCloud, then back in, but it takes forever to reinstall everything, so I'd emreally/em rather not. ☹️  <answer275719> Phew!  (Grinning Face with Squinting Eyes and Sweat Drop)  Here's how I solved this:  ol liSwipe up from bottom to reveal Control Panel/li liToggle bluetooth &amp; wifi off, then on/li /ol  And now AirDrop works. Wish the iPhone would automatically cycle the wireless antennae when this kind of thing happens…but at least I don't have to wait hours for all my iCloud content to re-sync. *w00t!**  (Remember w00t?! )
