Cursor as full screen crosshairs <body> I have a 27" iMac running Snow Leopard.  In a wide range of applications I often need to use a straight edge to compare different values on charts, even sometimes charts generated by different applications.  To do this I have made do with clumsy solutions like creating a floating and transparent Sticky or using kbdShift + Command + 4/kbd.  I've also tried a small app called Crosshairs.  None of these things do what I really want.  Ideally, I'd like a full screen crosshair centered on the cursor.  Another way to think about this, it would give me a full height vertical and full width horizontal line that would show up over (on top of) any and all applications, just as a cursor does. Nice to haves it would give the coordinates of the display and have toolbar or right click access to turn it on or off.  Any suggestions?  <answer48518> While it has many more features than this, something like xScope sounds great for this.   Some main features:  ul limirroring/li ligetting on screen dimensions/li lirulers/li liguides/li liframes/li licrosshair/li /ul  <answer48537> Free solution: Mouse Locator http://www.2point5fish.com/  You can make whatever custom cursors you want.  Hotkeys can turn it on/off, and if you want coordinates, you could launch Pixie (or another app) and keep it in the corner.  <answer155941> There's a new app on the App Store called Euclid that claims to do what you're asking. I have not personally tried it but it looks nice enough!  strongedit:/strong I went ahead and bought Euclid to try it out. Nice little app and the crosshairs do work well. My only gripe at this point is that I wanted to take screenshots with it and as of now it doesn't do that nor does it work with the built in Cmd-Shift-4 tool. I've emailed the developer and am hoping he responds with an update.  strongupdate1:/strong The Euclid dev has responded to me stating that he's working on imrpovements. Hopefully these will be forthcoming!  strongupdate2:/strong I found another possible solution, there's a free app called Monosnap that displays full-screen crosshairs when capturing an area. You can trigger it via a hotkey and then hit ESC to cancel without actually taking a screenshot if all you want to do is use the crosshairs for alignment.  <answer155944> For a different approach, you can try Free Ruler for Mac OS X. This free application displays a horizontal and a vertical ruler, both of which you can extend. It supports different scales (cm, mm, pixels, inches, etc - it's using the screen DPI to display distance measurements correctly).  I use it quite often when I need pixel-perfect measurements of GUI elements, or other stuff and the application I work with doesn't give me what I need in terms of the measurements.   Please note, I'm NOT affiliated with the developer in any way, just a happy user for the occasional time that an application like this serves my needs.   <comment55571> SnagIt for Mac does exactly this: a full screen crosshair with pixel coordinates, when you take a screen shot. But it's only designed for screen shots. http://goo.gl/D0JnL <comment55619> Great little app.  WAy more than I need for what I do need of it works like a charm.  Thanks. <comment183589> Thanks for the recommendation.  xScope still does everything I need it to do.
