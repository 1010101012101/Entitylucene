WiFi service hangs after random amounts of time <body> Sometimes - often when waking from sleep - the wifi service on my early 2011 MacBook Pro will simply stop functioning. I can open the wifi menubar icon, but clicking "Turn On" or "Turn Off" won't do anything. After dealing with this problem for several days on Mavericks, I upgraded to Yosemite, and when I sleep the laptop and then wake it, in the menubar which appears before logging in, the wifi connection symbol is simply gone; logging in makes it reappear in the menubar, but it is always then in a disconnected state. In an attempt to try to slap the wireless device drivers or services or other misbehaving process into obedience, I have tried the following commands:  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off networksetup -setairportpower en0 on sudo ifconfig en0 off &amp;&amp; sudo ifconfig en0 on /code/pre  This one sequence of commands crashes the computer straight to an off state. No logs are left behind.  precodesudo ifconfig en1 off &amp;&amp; sudo ifconfig en1 on /code/pre  Any ideas? Hardware problem? I was suspecting that at heart the issue may be a kernel panic, but since no logs are left behind by the crash I have no idea.  EDIT: Here are the last 30 lines of console output (while searching for "wake") after a successful wake (no WiFi problems after waking:)  precode2/6/15 4:32:01.000 PM kernel[0]:

starts with airport.... <comment200964> I see nothing new in the logs after waking from sleep, even unrelated to airport/network. What do you mean about what other network settings besides wifi? I am not using wired internet, and I haven't tested it with wired internet yet. <comment200965> Do you have any other Network settings beside WiFi, like USB stick, Thunderbolt, VPA, BlueTooth, Sharing ect... in syst pref networks. In the Console log immediately following the wake reason the should be stuff like AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/.. and many more lies showing how system connects to your Network (via WiFi) <comment200966> I am assuming you know how to use the Console log see that you do use Terminal. Bt just in case. Open Console in Utility folder, select all messages, type "wake" in the search now copy the following 30 lines in here (the will contain WiFi network activity. <comment200969> Under Network settings, Sys. Preferences/Network gives me the options of Ethernet, FireWire, Wi-Fi, and Thunderbolt Bridge. The Console output was too long to put in a comment, I am editing my original post to contain it. <comment200971> Actually, I'll grab the console output after the wireless fails. The wireless hasn't failed yet after my most recent reboot, but I do have 30 lines of normal console output that I'll edit my original post to contain. <comment200972> ok, its a deal :), but from this Log, I have to ask if you have the Little Snitch app installed ? <comment201131> I do not have this app installed. Also, my post has been edited to contain the last 30 lines of console output (searching for wake) after a wifi failure.
