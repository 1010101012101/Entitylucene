How to increase keyboard key repeat rate on OS X? <body> I know how to set the strongkey repeat rate/strong using codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard/code but it looks that the fastest settings is not enough.  Is there any way to speed up even more?  I do not know if others encountered the same issue, but I'm using a MacBook Pro, model 2010.  <answer10468> I just discovered that I had KeyRemap4MacBook installed and inside this application you have lots of low level settings for key repeat.  Now I'm happy with 400ms initial repeat time and 20ms repeat wait.    <answer83923> You can also change the preference keys directly:  precodedefaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 10 # normal minimum is 15 (225 ms) defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1 # normal minimum is 2 (30 ms) /code/pre  The changes aren't applied until you log out and back in. KeyRepeat can't be set between 2 (30 ms) and 1 (15 ms) though.  I also use KeyRemap4MacBook. I've set the repeat rates to 40 ms and the initial repeat rates to 150 ms.  <answer188129> Old post, but this may help someone: If you are using the "Karabiner app" (https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) which is a third party app commonly used to remap keys (or make OS X keyboard mimic some of Windows keyboards behaviors) it will bypass your OS X configurations.  If you are using it, to increase your keyboard rate you should go to the app and on the second tab ("Key Repeat") you'll find the option Repeat Rate. Changing that will render immediate effect and, as far as I can tell, it's the only way to get the repeat rate changed when using this app.  <answer235826> @user495470's answer is great for native apps, but for whatever reason, it appears to have messed up key repeat for me in XQuartz windows.  To work around the issue, I initially ran this in the terminal:  precodexset r rate &lt;initial wait&gt; &lt;number of repeated strokes per second&gt; /code/pre  Leaving off the last 2 arguments will reset the system defaults.  I read that you have to run this command every time you run XQuartz anew, but when I put it in my login script, it caused the system to hang on shutdown (until I killed the hung xset commands) and on startup, so I discovered that a better way to change the key repeat setting is to first disable the little bubble menu that appears above a typed character upon press &amp; hold, e.g. hold down the a key and you are presented with a bubble containing alternate 'a' characters with various umlauts, accents, etc..:  precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false /code/pre  emThen/em run the key repeat commands:  precodedefaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 10 # normal minimum is 15 (225 ms) defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1 # normal minimum is 2 (30 ms) /code/pre  If you do it this way, key repeats will work in XQuartz windows without needing to run codexset r # #/code.  <comment43180> I have the same problem on OSX Lion on an iMac: the max repeat speed in System Preferences  Keyboard is insufficient (I use vim where fast repeated keystrokes really speed up navigation - but the faster speed is also useful in browsers).  Thx for the KeyRemap4MacBook tip - works great. <comment171340> This app has been renamed `Karabiner` and the options for Key Repeat are currently in the top row of tabs under "Key Repeat" between "Change Key" and "Status Message".  Works great, was able to reduce it too far and bump it back up to sanity. <comment249589> FYI: KeyRemap4MacBook was renamed to Karabiner <comment271049> I can't believe it took me so long to look for the answer. This is amazing. Also, I did not have to log out and back in with Yosemite. <comment294385> This answer worked for me. Note that 10 is very fast. I found 12 similar to what I use in Windows. <comment295011> Regretting the wasted time of a decade.  <comment321544> Looks like I had to do this again after upgrading to macOS Sierra. <comment339302> How do you determine how many milliseconds a value is? Are they just 15ms multiplied by the defaults value? How did you determine that, or is it documented somewhere? <comment350678> one note you might miss in the answer - **log out/in or restart your machine to have changes take effect**
