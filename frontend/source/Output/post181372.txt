Open arbitary file from Finder in TextMate <body> In Finder, I see a file with the ".rel" extension.  I'd like top open it in TextMate.  I don't see TextMate in the list of choices, and, in fact, can't find it anywhere in the list of applications when I try to choose the application to open it with.  How can I tell Finder to open the file in TextMate, either now or always (by default)? How can I open an arbitrary file (i.e. even one with a known extension) from Finder in TextMate?
