Free (if possible) Video Converter <body> I've been getting along with VisualHub (defunct) for a while now, but recently I've needed an expanded set of Codec's, in particular Theora and VP8.sup1/sup  <answer3101> FFmpeg might be what you're looking for. It is free and supports Theora and VP8.  <answer3105> A couple free programs:  ul liMiro Video Converter - Free but very limited in terms of customization. But does support Theora and VP8l/li liFFMPEG on the command line - Harder to use but it's free./li liVideo Monkey - Based on the open sourced replacement of Visual Hub/li /ul  <comment2751> for encoding or decoding or both? <comment2752> @calavera: Both. <comment2753> Can you get FFmpeg to build natively on 10.6.2? Mine hangs on configure. <comment2754> @Josh K: You may want to try using MacPorts or a different package manager instead to get a working copy. <comment2755> @Chealion: I try to stay away from those as much as possible, but it looks like it only has 0.5.1 available as a package anyways. <comment2756> MacPorts currently has FFmpeg 0.6 available. <comment2757> @Josh K: Fair enough. Most of the less expensive "converters" are just GUIs to FFMPEG and related utilities. <comment2758> @sentinel: I'll double check, I my search returned 5.1... <comment2759> Accepting because it's the correct answer and at the core of 90% of the encoding programs. <comment2768> I did a MacPorts update (took a half and hour) found ffmpeg 0.6 and installed it (took a few hours). Overall this works, thanks! <comment103685> @JoshK - for many setups macports now does binary downloads so this should only take minutes now
