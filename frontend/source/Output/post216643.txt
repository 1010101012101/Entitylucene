How to remove bold from desktop font on OS X El Capitan <body> I find the bold font on the desktop  takes up more room than necessary and doesn't make the text any easier for me to read. Is there a way I can remove this bold formatting independently from the rest of the system font?  OS X 10.11.1  Many thanks for your help  <answer216668> The only option available is changing font size (upon right clicking desktop), not the font or even its color.
