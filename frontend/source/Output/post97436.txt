Vim, MacVim, and Unicode <body> Unicode characters appear in regular old vim in the terminal (iTerm), but not MacVim. Is there a way to get MacVim to handle Unicode characters appropriately. If it helps, I installed them using homebrew.  I grabbed these lines from the Vim Wiki:  precodeif has("multi_byte")   if &amp;termencoding == ""     let &amp;termencoding = &amp;encoding   endif   set encoding=utf-8   setglobal fileencoding=utf-8   "setglobal bomb   set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,latin1 endif /code/pre  <answer202490> If you mean that Unicode characters don't render correctly try disable the "Use Core Text renderer" option in the "Preferences… → Advanced" menu and restart MacVim. (source 1, source 2)  I have a similar problem, in which emoji charachters are rendered to big, but as of yet I don't know how to fix it.  <comment170982> What exactly is MacVim doing wrong?  Unicode works fine on my install in both GUI and Terminal (mvim -m) mode.
