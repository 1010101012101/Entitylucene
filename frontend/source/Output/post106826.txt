What is Swiftly on mac? <body> I upgraded to Mavericks a few days ago and since then I keep getting a pop up floating search box randomly. I do not know what triggered it and I do not know where it is from. It is driving me crazy. Can anyone tell me?  I have Alfred and ShiftIt installed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JCQQw.png" alt="Just enjoy Swiftly :)"  <answer106858> Do you have QQ Instant Messenger installed?  On my computer, this was the cause for this strange popup window.  <answer120426> To close the function, open QQ's Preferences (Shortcut: Cmd + ,) Go to the tab Swifly, then set the launch key to Empty.   <comment125430> YES it is!!!!!!!! <comment137671> As for the trigger, it's pressing Command key (âŒ˜) twice. <comment181926> Drove me crazy !
