Remove symbol link <body> In terminal, I have made a strongsymbol link/strong like following:  precodeln -s ../../../../ jni/prod /code/pre  It symbol links codeprod/code strongdirectory/strong (which is 4 levels up from current location) to codejni/prod/code .   I'd like to emphasize that it symbol links a strongdirectory/strong NOT a strongfile/strong.  Now, I want to remove this symlink, how to do it?  <answer108564> If you find yourself confused about where a file really exists, cd to the directory you expect and use coderm -i/code and refrain from adding any path - delete the file in the current directory. Also, in unix, everything is a file - including a directory. You do have saving grace that trying to delete a file that looks like a directory will pause unless you are recursively deleting files.  Worst case, you could use codels -lai/code to inspect the inode numbers to be sure a file is really symlinked and not hard linked.  If that doesn't help, make a temp directory and play with links:  precodetouch foo ln foo bar       # hard link ln -s foo baz    # sym link ls -lai rm foo ls -lai /code/pre  At this point, you have the hard link file bar left and a sym link to the missing "foo" file. Since in your case, the link is in a different directory than the target, you shouldn't have too much problem deleting the item you wish.  <answer108566> A symbolic link is a file even if the link is to a directory.  So if you simply did an coderm/code that will get rid of the link:  precoderm jni/prod /code/pre  <comment127263> What did you try already? <comment127264> And more importantly, if you don't describe what you "don't get" then people have to guess. Hopefully my guess as to what you don't get about symlinks was correct.
