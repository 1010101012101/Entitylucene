Can't modify partitions <body> I was beta-testing an Operating System and set up a separate 50 GB partition on my single 500 GB SSD. Now I cannot remove the beta partition. It shows up as another disk entirely. What can I do? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NXEuC.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JZGpC.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, I can't make any modifications to the partition structure (no + or - available, nor can I rename a partition). I should also add that the primary 450 GB partition is encrypted with FileVault 2, but the beta partition was not encrypted.  pre/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         447.6 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:          Apple_CoreStorage                         51.1 GB    disk0s4    5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Î²                     *50.5 GB    disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s4                                  27FE73A1-740C-4600-B2C1-7252F1279293                                  Unencrypted /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *447.3 GB   disk2                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  4E37E178-D9FC-4D18-8157-E57A65AB283B                                  Unlocked Encrypted /pre  <answer152054> Thanks @Tetsujin. The listing looked a little screwy so I was a little hesitant to go mucking around with the command-line diskutil. But I ended up doing a prediskutil corestorage list/pre and then   prediskutil corestorage delete [UUID of 50GB Logical Volume Group]/pre  GUI Disk Utility correctly saw the 50 GB of empty space as part of the other Logical Volume Group and I was able to delete it and merge it back in fine.  <comment178939> Logical Volume Group ... world of pain since Yosemite. One of the main reasons I'm not touching it yet.
