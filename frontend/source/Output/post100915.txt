What Version of Bash comes with OSX 10.9 / Mavericks? <body> Trying to decide if I want to bother upgrading my bash shell to v4.x; if it comes with Mavericks, I probably won't, but I can't find much information on what versions of bash come with what versions of OS X, let alone with Mavericks specifically.

Takes a couple minutes, you're not disturbing anything else, and you're not modifying your system. <comment125968> For completeness sake, the same version is shipped with the release version of Mavericks. <comment238354> This answer is absolutely identical to the accepted answer which was posted and accepted eight months earlier. And it's improperly formatted. It should be deleted. <comment292145> and same for Yosemite and ElCapitan
