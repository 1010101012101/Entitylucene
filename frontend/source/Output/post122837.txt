Where are cellular data preferences stored in iOS? <body> In Settings → Cellular (Mobile in UK), settings can be changed regarding mobile data, including per-app switches for all installed apps to enable or disable mobile data.  Where are these preferences stored?  I've looked in /var/mobile/Library/Preferences, but there doesn't seem to be any preferences relating to this. I've searched through the plists for various strings including app names and IDs from the list of per-app settings, but not found anything.  <answer122881> The directory you're looking for happens to be code/var/wireless/Library/Preferences/code. This is where the codeSettings &gt; Cellular/code settings are stored. The per-application settings are stored in the database code/var/wireless/Library/Databases/CellularUsage.db/code. If you want to add a setting manually, you'll need to add an entry for the application in two tables. The first is codebundle_uuid/code, and you'll need to set the codebundle_id/code field to the friendly bundle name (such as codecom.developersbliss.Helicopter/code), and then the codemacho_uuid/code field to its UUID (such as codeDD314675-0AA8-8A84-DB2BB966BAD8/code) (Repeat this step for each UUID that the application has. In my particular example, there are two UUIDs. Just add another entry to the table for each UUID, but with the codebundle_id/code set the same as before, and with the codemacho_uuid/code set to the next UUID the application has.). Then you'll need to make an entry in the codebundle_info/code table with the codebundle_id/code field set to the friendly bundle name used in the codebundle_uuid/code table, and then the codeflags/code field set to code0/code. This will make that particular application be restricted from using cellular data. To enable the application to use cellular data again, just set its codeflags/code field in the codebundle_info/code table to code1/code. Any application not found in this database is assumed to be allowed to use cellular data.  <comment143372> Apple stores many info in a *cache.db (* is wildcard for almost everything). Is there a cellular.db or preferences.db available on the iPhone? I don't have an iPhone image right here so I'm unable to grep. <comment143375> @Robuust I'm not seeing a cellular.db/preferences.db anywhere. There are numerous cache.db files in ~/Library/Caches, but I was presuming there was an actual place where the settings are stored permanently. <comment143379> @Buscar웃 In ~/Library/Preferences? Nope <comment143476> Great answer — thank you! Congrats on the 2k too :) <comment143585> @grgarside These are the kinds of questions I come here for! I'll be the first person on the site to get a [tag:jailbreak] tag badge. Oh, and this is my second time reaching 2K on AskDifferent (because of a bounty I paid), but thanks. <comment146112> @grgarside And there we have it. I'm officially the first person to be awarded the [jailbreak tag badge](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/badges/129/jailbreak). I can't wait for JailbreakCon 2014, and I hope it's just as awesome as when I was there for 2012. There's so much to learn there from so many of the big players. <comment160620> This answer is fantastic, more so than I ever expected when I asked the question — I've put a bounty & hope you get more upvotes as a result (enjoy your +50 too) <comment160635> @GeorgeGarside Thanks! <comment161298> Good work Andrew - and kudos on the badge and effort to provide technical expertise on jailbreaking iOS. <comment163196> @AndrewLarsson Sorry to spam your answer but could you shed any light on this problem: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/137349/disabling-one-apps-cellular-data-inadvertently-disabling-other-apps
