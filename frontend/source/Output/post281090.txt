VPN connection of specific domains <body> I'm using the internal VPN client of macOS Sierra. By default all traffic is passing over the VPN connection. I would like to modify the routing table in a way such that only specific domains/IP addresses are routed over VPN. This topic is discussed many times (in general threads that were opened years ago) and the solution that I extracted is described in the following. The gateway address  of my network is 10.10.0.1. After establishing the VPN connection (interface ipsec0) the routing table is the following:  precodeRouting tables  Internet:  Destination        Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire  default            link#11            UCS            18        0  ipsec0  default            10.10.0.1          UGScI           5        0     en0 2.16.31.65         link#11            UHWIi           1       13  ipsec0 10.10/21           link#4             UCS             1        0     en0 [...]  Internet6: Destination                             Gateway                         Flags         Netif Expire default                                 2001:4c80:40:2041::             UGc          ipsec0 default                                 fe80::21a:a9ff:fe16:1377%en0    UGcI            en0 default                                 fe80::%utun0                    UGcI          utun0 default                                 fe80::%utun1                    UGcI          utun1 ::1                                     ::1                             UHL             lo0 2001:4c80:40:2041::/64                  fe80::7a4f:43ff:fe64:be93%ipsec0 Uc           ipsec0 [...] /code/pre  Now we can add a new rule to route the traffic for a specific domain via VPN:  precode sudo route add -host www.google.com -interface ipsec0 /code/pre  and a new entry is added to the routing table:  precode 216.58.205.228     ipsec0             UHS             0        0  ipsec0 /code/pre  Since the default route uses the VPN connection we need to set it back to the original gateway:  precode route -n delete default -ifscope en0  route -n delete -net default -interface ipsec0  route -n add -net default 10.10.0.1 (the original gateway) /code/pre  The routing table is now the following:  precodeRouting tables  Internet: Destination        Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire default            10.10.0.1          UGSc            3        0     en0 10.10/21           link#4             UCS             1        0     en0 10.10.0.1/32       link#4             UCS             1        0     en0 10.10.0.1          0:1b:21:b2:66:c9   UHLWIir         6       40     en0   1118 [...] 216.58.205.228     ipsec0             UHS             0        0  ipsec0 [...]  Internet6: Destination                             Gateway                         Flags         Netif Expire default                                 2001:4c80:40:2041::             UGc          ipsec0 default                                 fe80::21a:a9ff:fe16:1377%en0    UGcI            en0 default                                 fe80::%utun0                    UGcI          utun0 default                                 fe80::%utun1                    UGcI          utun1 ::1                                     ::1                             UHL             lo0 2001:4c80:40:2041::/64                  fe80::7a4f:43ff:fe64:be93%ipsec0 Uc           ipsec0 [...] /code/pre  And that's the point where I got stuck. After the last step I can't establish any connection. I suspect a little bit that it has to do with IPv6, since I change the routing table for IPv4 only?! I'm thankful for any help.
