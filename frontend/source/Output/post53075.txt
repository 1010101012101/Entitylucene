When will Finder use large amount of memory? <body> Sometimes I see the iMac with 4GB of RAM having a few MB of swap file only, and after I left for a few hours and come back, the swap file is 2.7GB.  Looking into the Activities Monitor, the Finder is using 796MB.  How can it use so much memory -- could it be due to some "Search" that was left over in a Finder window?  I then chose File - Close All (by pressing down the kbdOption/kbd key while clicking File, and closed all Finder windows, only that it still won't close but just hidden, and looks like the only way is to reboot.  How can this situation be prevented?  <answer53100> I can't say much about preventing this, but there is no need to reboot. Just kill Finder, using Force Quit from the apple menu or codekillall Finder/code in a Terminal window. A new Finder will then be started in the old one's place.  <answer105832> This  inconvenience is caused by a finder prefs entry:  "show in new window: all my files" this is consuming too much mem. Select a different folder and all is fine  <answer295808> It appears that the only way to get the memory back is to kill Finder.  Finder on my Mac now is using 371 megabytes.  <comment60721> Will that swap space be automatically relinquished if some other process wants it? <comment65154> It sound like **memory leak**. You should repport it the apple and try update. <comment129893> On my computer, changing this setting and following Harald's option reduced Finder's memory usage from ~1GB to ~70MB. <comment227257> Same for me, from 700-800MBs to ~40 <comment230986> didn't help me :-/ <comment357473> but why should we keep having to do this?
