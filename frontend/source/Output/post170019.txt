If I'm storing music and movies in iTunes, does it free up space on my Mac? <body> My Macbook has 250 GB hard drive but I'm at 220 GB of movies and music. If I transfer those files from my Mac to iTunes will if free up space on my Mac?  <answer170020> No, placing files in iTunes doesn't reduce the space required on the Mac. The files are still stored on your Mac.  <comment199810> iTunes or iTunes Match? <comment199843> In fact, if you have 'Keep iTunes Media folder organised' and 'Copy files to iTunes Media folderâ€¦' both on you could be doubling up the number of music files without realising.
