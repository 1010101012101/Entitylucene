Finder quits unexpectedly <body> I got the "Finder Quit Unexpectedly" upon turning on my MacBook Pro (purchased 2010) today.  Went to Everything Mac booklet that came with computer, I have not done an upgrade recently because the next one would not support AppleWorks which is the mainstay of my work.  I do not know the name of the OS I stopped on. These are the steps recommended in the book:   ol liReset power manager; /li liReset PRAM; /li liHardware test from disk holding down kbdD/kbd when starting (no error codes); /li liFrom Mac OS X install DVD did restart holding down kbdC/kbd - when  installer instructed, open Disk Utility and followed instructions.  /li /ol  When restarting same error message came back; "Finder quit unexpectedly".   My next question would be, is the Finder a software issue that can be restored from the application restore disk?  I have tried everything else.   <comment350527> Welcome to Ask Different! :) Have you checked out all the _answers_ [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/146953/finder-quit-unexpectedly?rq=1)?
