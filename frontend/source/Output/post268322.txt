My iMessages are still merging even though we have separate Apple IDs <body> My phones messages are still syncing with my iPad's even though both devices have separate IDs. The only device I'm signed in on is my phone, yet everything is still synced? I was wondering how to unsync both devices completely?  <answer268363> Changing Apple ID won't remove previous messages received, only future messages. In the Messages app, you will have to manually delete each conversation to remove the message history.
