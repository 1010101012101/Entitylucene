Accessibility settings asking everytime <body> Those two apps are always asking for the accessibility permission, one is location and the other is contacts. As the picture shows that I have emalready/em enabled those settings for them. It keep asking me every time I quit the app or on system startup when it run because of login items. Is there anyway to make it not ask again? or make the settings permanent.  OS : MacOS Sierra (10.12)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eEDQ0.png" alt="enter image description here"     The location permission for the Forecast bar is already granted, but whenever the app started, I found out that the location setting has been emunticked/em, by itself.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOL9Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment332620> Did you get any solution, same problem here I havent found workaround yet. <comment332621> Sadly no. @PujanSrivastava I still have to grant access every time I reboot my mac.
