Copy, Paste, Cut, Select-All Keyboard Shortcuts <body> I recently bought am older Mac (Mac G5 with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger). I have a PC keyboard and when I tried the keyboard shortcuts for text editing such as copy, paste, cut, select-all I realized they don't work.  I researched the web for some help and found that the Mac keys are not in the same place as Windows keys. Most probable kbdalt/kbd acts as kbdcontrol/kbd because that's where the kbdcommand/kbd key on a Mac keyboard is placed or sometimes Windows key. None of the combinations seem to work.  The kbdcontrol/kbd key works on the Mac because I can switch between FireFox tabs by pressing kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdtab/kbd, kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdtab/kbd or I can use kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdZ/kbd and kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdY/kbd.  Do you have any ideas why this is not working and how I can fix it?  <answer12234> Almost all of the keyboard shortcuts you've learned on Windows are the same on the Mac. The difference is which modifier key you use to invoke them.  On Windows, shortcuts are typically invoked with the kbdCtrl/kbd modifier key.  On the Mac, you use the kbdimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFJgt.gif" alt="Command"/kbd key, also known as the "command" key. It's in the same physical position as the kbdAlt/kbd key on a Windows keyboard, but is emnothing/em like the Alt key.  The Mac has its own Alt key, labeled kbdOpt/Alt/kbd. Its primary use is a secondary modifier for keystrokes. Command-Option-S might be "Save As", for example, while Command-S is regular "Save".  The kbdCtrl/kbd key is there on a Mac keyboard, too, but it's hardly ever used for anything.  br The relative layouts look something like this:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PC: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kbdCtrl/kbd kbdWindows/kbd kbdAlt/kbd  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mac: &nbsp; kbdCtrl/kbd kbdOpt/Alt/kbd kbdimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFJgt.gif" alt="Command"/kbd  br The emproblem/em is that you're most likely using a PC keyboard on your Mac. In emthat specific case/em, the kbdOpt/Alt/kbd and kbdimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFJgt.gif" alt="Command"/kbd keys are reversed. You can change this in System Preferences, under Keyboard. Truly a huge pain in the rear for switchers. emThat/em layout looks like this, instead:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PC keyboard on Mac: &nbsp; kbdCtrl/kbd kbdimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFJgt.gif" alt="Command"/kbd kbdOpt/Alt/kbd   br Apple's website has some pretty good hints and tips for Windows switchers.

I downloaded DoubleCommand and selected Control key acts as Command Key and hit Activate. Works perfectly now. <comment12747> Thanks for the information, now I know why the command key is next to the CTRL key , its because of the windows keyboard. Still didn't help me to much because command key(windows on my keyboard) didn't work with those key combination's. Seems I had to download DoubleCommand and switch command key with CTRL and works great now. <comment160174> "Almost all of the keyboard shortcuts you've learned on Windows are the same on the Mac." But we all know this is true because Windows copied them 1:1!
