What is "convention@local" in Safari Saved Passwords/Keychain? <body> I updated to macOS 10.12.4 today and discovered a bizarre set of credentials stored in my iCloud Keychain/Safari saved passwords. I was wondering if anybody else was experiencing this or knows anything about it?  After updating to 10.12.4, I went to Safari - Preferences - Passwords. Listed were all my usernames and passwords, along with one extra:  strongWebsite:/strong appears as codeaddress/code, but when clicked reveals: codehttps:////code  strongUsername:/strong codeconvention@local/code  strongPassword:/strong codeconvention/code  What's stranger is that I cannot delete this entry from Safari. I attempt to remove it, but it just stays there after I confirm I want to delete it. The only way to remove it was via Keychain Access.  Any ideas on what this is and why it's only showing up now? Keychain Access said that it was modified back in July of last year, but I haven't seen it show up until updating today.
