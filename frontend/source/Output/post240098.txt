Network priority is not being observedâ€”how to fix? <body> I have my home network listed as highest priority in my list of Wifi networks, and my Karma Go (like a Mifi) listed strongemway/em/strong down the list, and yet I very frequently discover that I'm using my Karma Go when I'm at home and my home network is available and working just fine.  How can I get my Mac to work properly and always choose the higher-priority network over the lower-priority network?  <comment294984> Why do you have two connections to the Internet live in the first place? <comment295087> That should be pretty obvious: I was using the Karma Go and came home.  My computer should switch to the higher-priority network as soon as its available.  But there are lots of scenarios that would result in two networks live at once, which is why Apple lets you prioritize them. <comment295088> In short, the network priority you see there is "all things being equal" your priority will be whatever you have configured.  **However**, while you may be in range of your home WiFi, your MiFI in your bag may have a vastly better connection and thusly, it will direct traffic there.  Additionally, it won't do a handoff; meaning if it's connected, even far down the list, it will stay connected until you disconnect then when you do reconnect, it will reconnect to higher priority first.
