Data usage in MacBook Pro <body> Can someone tell me what is wrong with my MacBook Pro?  My normal data usage for 1 day is shown on the image below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kgSjM.png" alt="enter image description here"  But in the past few days and for just 1 hour (I have no idea why) my data usage spikes up and its totally unbelievable.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rhYzM.png" alt="enter image description here"  My usage is just the same as before, nothing change, and also lately I have been using 3G speed because of some network problem so I wonder why the usage had been GB when it should just be in MB?  Can someone explain why this happened and also advise on how to fix this?  <answer231197> If you leave Activity Monitor open, you ought to be able to sort by Sent or Received Byes to catch the culprit...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7dqtr.png" alt="enter image description here"
