Conditional format cells based on match in another sheet <body> I have 2 excel sheets (Using Microsoft excel 2011 for mac)  precodesheet1(Column D) foo bar  sheet2 abc cde foo sfd sdf dgf bar /code/pre  I have applied 3 rules using conditional format: 1. If any of the data in Sheet2 matches with Sheet1(ColumnD) - Make text as blue 2. If there are any duplicate values in sheet2 - Make text as yellow 3. If the above 2 are not there - leave it blank  But Only Rule2 and Rule3 are working. How can I make all of them work.And I how can I add one more rule which returns values which satisfies both Rule1 and Rule2  Rules:  precodeRule 1 # =NOT(ISERROR(MATCH($1:$1048576,'Sheet1'!$D:$D,0))) Rule 2 # Highlight Duplicate values with yellow text Rule 3 # =ISBLANK($1:$1048576) /code/pre  <answer161581> I'm not sure I am parsing the problem correctly, but I suspect this is the solution.  Make a new column in one of the pages that has a formula like...  =if(thispage!D2=otherpage!D2,"*","")  This will make a column where all the duplicates have a *. Now simply make a conditional on the other column that turns the text yellow if there is a * in there.
