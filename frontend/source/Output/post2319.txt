How do I change Mac OS X's sleep behavior with respect to USB plugging/unplugging? <body> If a USB device is plugged or unplugged, my MacBook Pro wakes up from sleep. Can this behavior be changed somehow? That is to say, I do not want my Mac to wake up when a USB device is unplugged.  <answer2321> The reason why the Mac awakes is because the USB device is drawing power from the Mac’s USB port. When you disconnect it, there’s a change in the voltage and the Mac awakes (same goes when you plug one).  Curiously, there’s a way to do it in Windows.  According to the guys at Super User, this is not possible on a Mac. At least not that we’ve discovered yet.   <comment1982> Thanks for the pointer. Exactly the info I needed. <comment23074> What a bummer... This is annoying, especially when I'm charging my phone from the Mac and then put the Mac to sleep but forget to unplug the phone. <comment23114> @Pawel in Lion I think that the display stays off now, which is something. :p I'd have to do some more testing to confirm this.
