Can I globally change the cmd-Q shortcut to require holding for two seconds, like the option in Chrome? <body> Many, many times, I accidentally press kbd⌘/kbd+kbdQ/kbd when I meant to close a tab or window, or switch applications. When I saw the option in Google Chrome to require the shortcut to be emheld/em, I was overjoyed. Problem is, I use Safari.  So, in short: How can I make the "hold command-Q" shortcut universal across all of my applications (or at least Safari)?  <answer45262> Here's a partial solution for starters:  h2Preventing accidental quitting in Safari (or any specific application)/h2  Simply set up an unusual keyboard shortcut for the "Quit Safari" menu item in Keyboard preferences.  This will disable the standard kbd⌘/kbdkbdQ/kbd shortcut, so accidentally hitting it doesn't make a difference — and you have to strongthink before you quit!/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hHo26.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbLdS.png" alt=""  (Unfortunately, I haven't found an easy way to do this for every application, without entering each one manually.)  <answer45314> Continuing on jtbandes' solution, once you have remapped the standard Quit command to a different keystroke (yes, sadly, you need to remap it manually for every application you are worried about accidentally quitting), you can create a service in Automator that takes no input. It should have a single action: Run AppleScript. The script is:  precodetell application "System Events"     set theName to name of the first process whose frontmost is true end tell tell application theName     display dialog "Are you sure you want to quit?"     quit end tell /code/pre  You then save that service (I called mine "SafeSave"), and assign the service the keystroke kbd⌘/kbdkbdQ/kbd. You have thus reclaimed the standard keystroke.  <answer95627> Another option is to use Karabiner with the following XML:  code__HoldingKeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_NONE, KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND, Option::NOREPEAT/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4eZS.png" alt=""  <answer99447> I don't believe that's possible.  <answer113333> CommandQ ($4.00) does exactly this. It's very customizable and has a nice GUI, though I haven't used it personally. It seems to fulfil the requirements of this question.  <answer201367> Douglas Teoh has made an app called SlowQuitApps, that does exactly this.     An OS X app that adds a global delay of 1 second to the Cmd-Q   shortcut. In other words, you have to hold down Cmd-Q for 1 second   before an application will quit.      When the delay is active, an overlay is drawn at the center of the   screen.   <comment51537> Where is this setting you speak of? <comment51538> Awesome question Timothy!! <comment51539> @Senseful It's counterintuitively under the Chrome menu, rather than Chrome preferences. <comment51540> "Warn Before Quitting." <comment51634> Clever. Hm, I suppose one could write a script to activate on cmd-Q which would then require another cmd-Q to complete the quit... <comment51714> Clever, indeed! Have an up vote! :-) <comment53371> Great question, leading to very useful answers! <comment53372> Very nice, I have implemented, and upvoted! <comment53374> Very nice, I have implemented, and upvoted! As an aside, by default ⌥⌘Q is "Quit and discard Windows". <comment53379> Oh drat, you're right. Well, ⌃⌘Q or something else should work too — however I find ⌥⌘Q a little harder to hit by accident. <comment216719> While the application has been renamed to [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), this answer worked great for me on 10.10 and was completely free. <comment256687> Can these two questions, and the answers, be merged? SlowQuitApps is not mentioned as an answer in the earlier question. <comment285180> I can't believe people are actually writing apps to achieve this.  Way to go “intuitive Apple!”
