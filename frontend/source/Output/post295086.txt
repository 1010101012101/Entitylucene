Numbers: Creating a Summary table based on values from different table <body> I have a table that looks much like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iDtPY.png" alt="enter image description here"  That strongCategory/strong column is entered manually and will have several duplicated values.  I’d LOVE to be able to create a “Summary” table that manages to copy and manipulate some of this data. Namely:  ul liIt would take the “Category” columns with its duplicates, remove duplicated and sort the list;/li liHave a second column that sums all values in that category’s fields;/li liAnd finally, have a third row that shows how many times the original keywords appeared in the first table./li /ul  Here is a screenshot of what I’m trying to achieve:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mPmj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Possible??  <answer295130> If your emcategory/em column contains categories that are correctly spelled each time, then a simple solution would be to use the codeSUMIFS()/code and the codeCOUNTIFS()/code formulas.  ul liIn the strongSummary/strong table, add a emcategory/em from the category column from the strongFinances/strong table./li liNext, in the emAmount/em column of your strongSummary/strong table, add the following formula: codeSUMIFS(2017 Finances::Amount,2017 Finances::Category,A2)/code Where codeA2/code contains a unique category./li liIn the emCount/em column, use this formula: codeCOUNTIFS(2017 Finances::Category,A2)/code/li liDrag the formulas down the columns to fill for each category./li liSort Ascending or Descending as desired./li /ul  The codeSUMIFS/code and codeCOUNTIFS/code compare the category column with the entry in the strongSummary/strong table's entry.  If there is a match, it sums or counts based on the category.  Repeat as needed.  strongNOTE:/strong  Dynamically creating a Summary table without knowing the categories is quite a bit more complicated as strongNumbers/strong does not have Pivot Table (as Excel or Google Sheets has) functionality as of the date this answer was posted.  Great suggestion for Apple Feedback.  See the illustrations below.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/32crC.png" alt="SUMIFS formula"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F3jSj.png" alt="Countifs formula"  <comment372522> What is like Access but for mac? <comment372571> @Lisa FileMaker. $$$ but is a proper relational database unlike Numbers or Excel. OpenOffice had a database too IIRC. <comment372618> This is really fabulous and so minimal. Everything else I found and/or tried was several combinations of functions. Thank you! <comment372620> Glad it works for you. Spreadsheets are great but they have their limits over a full blown database. But a database is overkill for this job. Vote up if you really want to thank me.  ;)
