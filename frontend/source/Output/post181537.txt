xrandr settings and XQuartz In Multi-monitor Yosemite Environment <body> I am currently struggling with an inability to move Xquartz (either latest stable or latest development) windows in the top third or so of my screen, as also described by another user.  My current solution is to manually set the resolution of the Xquartz display (not an Xwindows expert, apologies for any inaccurate language) in xterm:  codexrandr --output default --mode 3360x1080/code  Which gives me freedom of movement to the top of both my screens.  However this is at the cost of all Xwindows disappearing when I switch “focus” to another application: obviously undesirable if I wish to reference my current work in an X environment, from another application.    Is anyone aware of a way to enable full screen movement a la my provisional codexrandr/code workaround without losing the ability to view Xwindows while working in other applications?  Should I tweak the xrandr command/mix in any other settings?
