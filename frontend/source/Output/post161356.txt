Automatically mark Junk mail as read <body> I've enabled the builtin Mail rules to move junk mail directly to the junk folder. But the messages do not get marked as read, so they are shown/counted as unread in the Mail sidebar.  How can I mark mail that goes to Junk and Trash folders as read automatically?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8YukC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer161357> For Junk Mail, you can create a strongRule/strong. From the menu bar item “Mail”, select  Preferences  Rules  Add Rule. Make a rule with the following conditions:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/09OlH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  For strongTrash/strong, you can simply bypass Mail’s Trash and rely on the server settings of the email account. To do so, from the “Mail” menu bar item (again)  Preferences  Accounts  em[select account]/em  Mailbox Behaviors  strongemuncheck/em/strong “Move Deleted Messages To the Trash Mailbox”  <comment188512> Tried rules already - not working. Even tried through custom action in Junk mail preferences. <comment188513> @ranklord Remove the custom actions. Revert to default Junk Mail Filters. Quit Mail, then re-open. attempt to rebuild both the Junk and Trash Mailboxes from the “Mailbox” menu bar item  Rebuild. You need to select each mailbox individually beforehand. <comment188516> I don't have custom actions anymore since they do not work either :) The problem is that Rules have to be applied MANUALLY, i.e. you select Folder (or set of messages) and then  from menu Messages - Apply Rules. Therefore it solves my problem for 50% only :) <comment188518> @ranklord No, you manually create a rule. The rule does what it’s told to do from then on. You only apply the rule manually if you are applying it to a message that doesn’t meet the criteria laid out when you created the rule.
