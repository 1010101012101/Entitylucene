How do I stop my phone from turning off the display whenever I put my finger over the phone speaker? <body> I have an iPhone 6, and recently I've found out that if you put your finger on the thing next to the front camera, the display will turn black. but I can't find a setting to turn it off. Anyone know where it is? Or if I can? This isn't just calls it's anytime.  <answer259153> The proximity sensor next to the front camera/speaker engages when it believes the device is being held to your face. Holding your finger over it causes the same effect.  There is no way to disable the proxmity sensor.  <answer259159> In this case, it was just a bug. All you need to do to fix this is to restart your iPhone and it should be fixed. Thanks to Apple support.  <answer291148> It's very simple to make it stop. All I did was turn my phone completely off and then turned it back on. It worked for me. Hopefully for you too.  <comment324151> I think it's the proximity sensor, not ambient light, right? <comment324152> You're probably right, though it maybe a combination of them. <comment324157> Turns out, this was just a bug <comment324162> I lol'd from that one! <comment324163> What? Bug? How is this a bug? <comment324182> @MattL. According to a person at Apple, they told me to reset all settings or restart your phone, and restarting seemed to help <comment324184> Oh, this is NOT when on a call. I see. <comment324241> @MattL. Yep. Not on calls <comment366713> Had the exact same issue. A restart indeed fixed it. Thanks @Alex! <comment366975> @Meredith restarting your iPhone fixes most bugs
