Way to select HTML tables by column and add them to the pasteboard? <body> Whenever you try to copy an HTML table to the pasteboard, it will select by row. Sometimes, I'd like to select by columns. Is there a way to do this? If not out of the box, any extensions that enable this kind of functionality.  <answer76101> As far as I know, there's no way to do that in Safari or Chrome, but in Firefox you can select ranges of cells by holding option and command.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zpwlz.png" alt=""  You could also copy the whole table and paste it to a spreadsheet application or use something like codepbpaste | cut -d $'\t' -f3/code. But it might not work if there are cells that contain br elements or rows that start with empty cells.  I've had to use something like this with a few tables that contained br elements:  precoderuby -e '`pbpaste`.scan(/&lt;tr&gt;.*?&lt;\/tr&gt;/m).each { |r| puts r.scan(/&lt;td&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/td&gt;/m)[2] }' /code/pre
