How can I remove the music bar in iMovie 10.0.3? <body> I last used iMovie 3 months ago, but now it's totally different.  I've figured out some things, but under the audio track there is now space for a music track, which I'm not using, and I can't see how to hide it.  It takes up so much room that I can't see enough of my clip to work on.  Is there any way to hide the music track if I'm not adding music?  <answer138802> emI presume you're referring to this bar at the bottom of the timeline:/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZvBiU.png" width="100"  At the time of writing (iMovie 10.0.4) this bar can not be hidden from the timeline.
