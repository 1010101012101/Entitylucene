Can a volume continue mounted after logging out? <body> I have a server with a startup script that mounts an external volume, I need this in order to back up some of the server files.  Most of the times the server works unattended but sometimes a user may log in. If the user logs out when done, the external volume is dismounted and I would like to avoid this.  The objective is to keep the volume mounted in any case: not just before log in (I've done this) but also strongemafter logging out/em/strong. Perhaps I should execute the mount script just after log out, is this possible?  <comment323791> This is from an [old article](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1269027?tstart=0) and I have not tested it: `sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/autodiskmount AutomountDisksWithoutUserLogin -bool true`
