Make the iPhone send “phone call start” and “phonoe call end” when not inside my app <body> I'm trying to figure out a way to make my iPhone app tell my server that the user has started/ended a phone call.  I need it to happen even when the app is not in the front.  In Android it's very easy. You register a BroadcastReceiver in the manifest.  But is there any option to do it in iPhone?  If there is not and a straight way - is there some workaround for it?  <answer206755> There are only few things you can do in the background while an app is running, knowing when the user started and/or ended a phone call isn't one of them.  I can only think of one workaround but it may not be worth the trouble, you can connect the phone call the user is making through a VoIP which you can easily monitor in the background mode.
