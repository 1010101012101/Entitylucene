Ghost Photos occuping space in iPhone 5 <body> I have no photos on my iPhone 5 running iOS 9.1 since all my photos sit in iCloud. Yet the phone shows 1.9 gb space occupied by Photos. No photos or videos are in any folders either. The "Recently Deleted" folder is also empty. I have also erased everything from the phone (Settings  General  Reset  Erase All Content And Settings), yet the phone memory continues to reflect 1.9gb of photo space. I also changed the Date &amp; Time setting on phone and shifted it back by 2 years but that did not change the status either. What should I do?  <comment263844> I'm pretty sure you iPhone stores a copy of the photos on the device even if they're stored in iCloud. <comment263927> So if that is the case where are the photos ? <comment264008> I'm not sure since I don't use iCloud for photos. This question might be of some help to you, since it sounds like they have a (somewhat) similar problem: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/177550/photos-album-disappeared
