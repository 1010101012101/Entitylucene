An Automator workflow for extracting text as speech from PDF files <body> I get PDFs to revise course content which I want to convert to MP3 files and take with me as spoken audio.  Automator offers 'text to speech' conversion and it's great. When I try and build a workflow around it, seemingly everything happens except what I need.  I want, as a folder action:  ul liTo extract the text from a PDF dropped on the relevant folder/li liTo get this text turned into spoken audio/li liTo provide details for iTunes/li liImport this into a playlist of my choosing/li /ul  I currently have variations on this sequence, which does not work:  ol liExtract PDF Text, save/li liConvert text to Audio, save/li liImport Audio/li liGive iTunes info/li liAdd title to PlayList/li /ol  Currently the PDF text gets extracted, doesn't end up where I expect, and the script then seems to hang on generating the audio. Simple TextEdit documents work fine.  What's wrong?  (This question is a continuation of one I asked yesterday: here)  <answer71297> While Automator is pretty useful, I personally find the Terminal / command line a nice place to solve problems like this.  The basic idea is still using the steps you describe, but doing all the work from the command line. I researched a useful PDF-to-Text converter, and I found strongPDFminer/strong quite useful. If you can get it to run, half of your work is done!  precodepip install pdfminer /code/pre  Step one and two, then can be solved with this one-liner in Terminal:  precodepdf2txt.py example.pdf | say -v Daniel -o example.aiff /code/pre  Still missing is the addition of metadata â€” what do you need here: Title / Album / "Artist"?  In a final step, you would add the file to a certain iTunes playlist. Depending on your ideal workflow, one then could build a little LaunchAgent that monitors a folder for new files...  <comment52722> So I've just tried to break this dowen into 3 scripts (Extact text; Convert to Audio; Import to iTunes) and I've reached my first hurdle - even the simple 'Add to folder and extract PDF text' doesn't work. What do I have to do to activate a folder scruipt other than saving the workflow?
