Macbook Pro Display Freezing <body> Yesterday I started experiencing display hiccups in my new Macbook Pro img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hr0D0.png" alt="Macbook pro version info"  The issue is most noticeable when playing videos, though it really effects every animation: minimizing windows, switching screens, even typing is now choppy. The display has hiccups where it freezes for a split second, making it very choppy. I get lots of warning from WindowServer in my console (snippet here). I've tried several solutions so far:  ul liRebooting/li liDisabling automatic brightness/li liResetting my user keychain/li liDisabling iCloud keychain/li liRemoving all user LaunchAgents/li liTurning WiFi off and on again/li /ul  but none of them have worked. I'd really like to avoid a full OS reinstallation and from what I can see, I'm not the only one experiencing this issue. It appears to be related to the 10.12.1 update.   <answer263969> Troubleshooting is basically a process of elimination and often requires patience. Below I have some steps for you to try and report back on.  strong1. Safe Mode/strong  What happens when you run your computer in Safe Mode? To do this:  ul liFully shutdown your computer/li liRestart your computer and immediately hold down the kbdShift/kbd key/li liOnce you're logged in, use the computer for long enough to establish if you still have the problem./li liFully shutdown your computer again/li liRestart your computer normally/li liOnce you're logged in, use the computer for long enough to establish if you still have the problem./li /ul  Once you've done the above, report back on how your computer was in Safe Mode and how it was again when not in Safe Mode.  strong2. Reset your NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:  ul listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ul  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).  strong3. Reset the SMC/strong  Your computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset. The instructions for doing this on your particular MacBook are:  ul liShut down your computer/li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ul  After resetting both your NVRAM and SMC, use your computer and report back on how it's now going.  <comment330756> Is this problem specific to a single video player? <comment330758> @sodiumnitrate No it is not. I also experience hiccups minimizing windows, switching between desktops, etc. <comment330759> When does it happen in addition to video playback? <comment330762> @sodiumnitrate It happens constantly. It's most noticeable during video playback because it's easier to notice a choppy video than choppy typing, but really everything on the display is choppy. <comment330784> I can't say which fixed it because I tried both before checking to see if it worked, but after resetting NVRAM and SMC the problem appears to be fixed. Thanks!
