Apple Keyboard isn't working correctly, error in my user's folder <body> MacOS interprets the arrow keys to the right side of the enter key wrong.  I'm not running any key modification software (like karabiner) on this mac.  When a different user logs in, this problem is gone, hence I assume that there's something wrong in my user's folder.   How can this be fixed? Is a reset of the entries possible?  <comment329129> What happens if you start in Safe Mode? You can do this by holding the Shift key down during startup. Also, have you checked your keyboard settings in System Preferences? <comment329154> I've already reset the System Preference settings. I'll try starting in safe mode.
