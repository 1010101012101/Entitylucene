Safari not loading pages, other browsers doing fine <body> I have an issue many seem to have: Safari 7.0.5 (and now 7.0.6) hangs when loading web pages whereas other browsers (Chrome, Firefox) work just fine. I've ran my tests on WiFi with two different routers as well as through iPhone tethering.  Here are the steps I have taken so far but the problem persists:  ul lire-installed my MacBook Air completely with the latest image from the App Store/li liReset Safari/li liDisabled extensions/li liUnchecked "Warn when visiting fraudulent website"/li liUnchecked "Stop plug-ins to save power"/li liIn the Develop menu, checked "Disable caches"/li liIn WiFi settings, disabled IPv6/li liChanged DNS to OpenDNS/li liDeleted all Safari plist, caches, favicons cache, etc./li liTurned off Safari in iCloud settings/li liFixed permissions, rebooted/li liDisabled the prefetch setting from terminal/li liEmptied all my logs, launched Safari and tried to open this url: https://pragprog.com/login .

Still no success. I tried to log in with the guest account as well but the problem is the same.  <answer142710> By verifying the issue in the Guest user you have identified the issue resides in a system shared resource. Attempt to reproduce the issue in Safe Mode. If the issue is not reproducible, reboot normally and check if the issues persist. If it does I would encourage you to backup your system and navigate over to the local Library located at em/Library/em. From here you can start troubleshooting by removing files from locations such as:  ul li./StartupItems/li li./LaunchAgents/li li./LaunchDaemons/li li./Internet Plug-ins/li /ul  Reboot your system and attempt to reproduce after each change. If all else fails you may be looking at an erase and install of your OS and selective migrating your data back on to the drive to avoid migrating the issue over.  Hope this helps!  <comment168105> The issue persists in safe mode. I already reinstalled the OS, this is a clean install. <comment168106> You mentioned in your post "re-installed my MacBook Air completely with the latest image from the App Store". This would imply you installed the OS on top of your existing system which would not be a "clean" install, a clean install would imply you deleted **everything** <comment168116> no, of course not. When I mean "clean install", what I did is downloaded Mavericks from the App Store, created a bootable USB drive, booted on it, formatted my HD completely and then installed. So, yeah, fresh install. Reading the log, I'm wondering if my issue could be linked to certificates in my keychain. <comment320380> Did you have parental control enabled - in your settings or router?
