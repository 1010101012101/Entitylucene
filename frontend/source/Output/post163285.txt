Switching back to 'production' version of Mac <body> Prior to Yosemite release I had installed the developer preview build on my Macbook. However, even after the public release I continue to get 'beta' updates from Apple (see included screenshot). How do I prevent this, and go back to the de-facto public version?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kPWb7.png" width="546"  <answer163290> Go to System Preferences → App Store → Change… → Do Not Show Pre-release Updates  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xgKz.png" alt=""
