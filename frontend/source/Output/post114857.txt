App Store says app is "INSTALLING" but nothing happens <body> I upgraded an old MacBook Pro to Mavericks, and I am now trying to download Xcode.  In App Store I searched for "xcode", found it, clicked "Install".  It is now saying "INSTALLING", but nothing happens, CPU at 0%.br If I let the computer unattended, it falls asleep (disk stops).br While waiting I tried to install MacPorts, but it says codeWaiting for other installations to complete.../code, so the installation is still going on somehow.  What should I do? Restarting App Store and does not fix the problem.  I rebooted and re-clicked INSTALL, and still the same problem.  It is a bit similar to this question but I have no code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate*/code file to delete.  <answer114879> Maybe this thread on Apple Support Communities is what you're looking for.  It sounds like it is, indeed, a cache problem. From the thread above, it'd seem you'd need to find the cache in the code/private/code directory. I'll include specific instructions, inspired by the thread:  ol liOpen Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)/li liType in this command: codesudo find /private/var -iname "com.apple.appstore"/code and press kbdEnter/kbd/li liFor each of of the found directories run coderm -r &lt;dir path&gt;/*/code (For the brave: codesudo find /private/var -iname "com.apple.appstore" | xargs sudo rm -r/code)/li /ol  <answer148387> Go to the App Store app. Click purchases. Click Pause on the app. It should pause.  Now search for the app again and it should say "Install". If you go to the purchases tap you should see that it restarted.  <comment261051> I did this but also had to restart my machine afterwards.
