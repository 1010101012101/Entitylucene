How do I install Windows 10 on MacBookPro5,1, with no optical drive (SSD+HDD) <body> I have a huge problem.  I am not able to install Windows 10 on my late 2008 MacBook Pro with bootcamp.  I have replaced the optical drive as it was not working with a 1 TB HDD and i have a SSD drive as well.

I have researched a lot on the problem, tried setting the partition active and many other things.  If someone can help me I would be very grateful.  Best, Anders   <answer201980> The following steps explain how to install Windows 10 on a hard disk drive (HHD) which replaced the original optical drive. The primary drive is assume to be a solid state drive (SSD) with the disk identifier "disk0". The HDD is assumed to be the secondary drive with the disk identifier of "disk1".  Note: If your OS X is El Captain (10.11) then you need to temporarily disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).  To do this, you will need to start up your Mac from the El Captain Recovery OS. Once started, open a Terminal application window and enter the command shown below.  precodecsrutil disable /code/pre  After installing Windows 10, you an enable SIP with the following command.  precodecsrutil enable /code/pre  With Windows 10 the default for Windows Update is to automatically download and install updates. You are allowed the option to select a time to restart the computer, but the default is for that to be automatic also. Evidently, with Windows 10 Home these are your only options. Other versions of Window 10 allow the user to "Configure Automatic Updates" with the same options offered by previous versions of Windows.  If you want to insure no Windows Updates are installed before before you manually "Configure Automatic Updates" or manually install the Boot Camp Support Software, you will need to boot in Audit mode during the installation of Windows 10. Watch for special instructions regarding Audit mode while implementing the following steps.     Note: Some of the steps, that do not involve VirtualBox, have images captured from a VirtualBox window. This was done when this was the easiest way to create an illustration. I suppose I could have cropped the images, but I chose not to.   (Hint: For a better view, click on an image or open an image in a new window.)  ol liAquire the Boot Camp Support Software (the drivers). The software can either be downloaded using the Boot Camp Assistant, downloaded directly from the Web or copied off a OS X installation DVD. See System requirements to install Windows on your Mac via Boot Camp for details. Try to get the latest available drivers for your Mac. If you are employing this procedure, most likely, Apple did not release Windows 10 drives for you model Mac./li liMake sure your firmware is up to date. See EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Macs. /li liCreate a strongemtemporary/em/strong MS-DOS (FAT) formatted partition on the SSD. You can use the Bootcamp Assistant, the Disk Utility, or commands (codedistutil/code, codegpt/code and/or codefdisk/code) entered in a Terminal window. Other third party tools, such as codegdisk/code, can also be used. Give the label for this partition the name "FLASHDRIVE". Since Apple recommends using a 16 GB flash drive to install Windows 10, the partition should be at least 16 GB in size. (In practice, this partition usually can be much smaller.) After Windows 10 is installed, you can remove this partition and recover the space. This partition will contain the files from the Windows 10 iso and the Boot Camp Support Software.     It is my understanding that this temporary partition must occur on the SSD (disk0). If you are able to use the HDD (disk1), please let   me know and I will update these instructions. /li liDownload and install a free copy of VirtualBox from Oracle. I used VirtualBox, Version 5.0.0 r101573, Copyright © 2015./li liInside your "Documents" folder, create a folder named "VirtualBox". This is where you will keep the files created in the rest of the steps./li liUse the Disk Utility application to create a single MS-DOS (FAT) formatted partition on the HDD. Make sure you use the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme. Name this partition "BOOTCAMP". This is where Windows 10 will be installed.     If you need to use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) for your partitioning scheme or need additional partitions on the HDD, let me   know.   strongQuit the Disk Utility./strong/li liSet the variables codeFILE0/code and codeFILE1/code to the absolute file names of the partitions named "FLASHDRIVE and "BOOTCAMP", respectively. To do this, open a Terminal application window and enter the following commands.  precodediskutil  list  disk0;  diskutil  list  disk1 /code/pre     emNote: I assume you are using the default Bourne-Again Shell (bash)./em   The output from the commands should be similar to the following. The disk identifier for a given disk or partition can be read from the last column marked "IDENTIFIER". The absolute file name for a partition can be derived by prepending the string "/dev/" to the disk identifier.  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS OS X                    239.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data FLASHDRIVE              15.5 GB    disk0s4 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 BOOTCAMP                1.0 TB     disk1s1 /code/pre  From the above output, one can deduce the the "FLASHDRIVE" and "BOOTCAMP" partitions have the disk identifiers "disk0s4" and "disk1s1", respectively. Using the same Terminal application window, enter the following assignment statements to set the variables. If your disk identifiers are different, make the appropriate substitutions.  precodeFILE0=/dev/disk0s4 FILE1=/dev/disk1s1 /code/pre/li liDeclare the other variables needed for the commands used in the subsequent steps. To do this, enter the following assignment statements in the same Terminal application window.  precodeDISK0=$(sed  -n  's/\(\/dev\/disk[0-9]*\).*/\1/p'&lt;&lt;&lt;$FILE0) DISK1=$(sed  -n  's/\(\/dev\/disk[0-9]*\).*/\1/p'&lt;&lt;&lt;$FILE1) PARTITION0=$(sed  -n  's/\/dev\/disk[0-9]*s\(.*\)/\1/p'&lt;&lt;&lt;$FILE0) PARTITION1=$(sed  -n  's/\/dev\/disk[0-9]*s\(.*\)/\1/p'&lt;&lt;&lt;$FILE1) /code/pre     Note: At this point, one should realize it would be easier to copy the statements from this document and paste them into the Terminal   application window.   Enter the following command to view the values of these new variables. Record your value for the variable codeDISK1/code. You will need to enter it in a later step.  precodeecho  -e  "DISK0=$DISK0\nDISK1=$DISK1\nPARTITION0=$PARTITION0\nPARTITION1=$PARTITION1" /code/pre  My computer generated the following output.  precodeDISK0=/dev/disk0 DISK1=/dev/disk1 PARTITION0=4 PARTITION1=1 /code/pre     If the value of codePARTITION0/code is greater than code4/code, you can strongnot/strong install Windows 10 on the "BOOTCAMP" partition. (emTechnically, this   is not true. Sent me a comment and I will post how to use   codegdisk/code to overcome this obstacle./em) /li liUsing the Finder application, mount the Windows 10 iso file. Copy the entire contents to root of the partition labeled "FLASHDRIVE". Afterwards, you can unmount the iso file./li liUsing the Finder application, copy the Boot Camp Support Software  (BCSS) folder to the root of the partition labeled "FLASHDRIVE".  strongNOTE:/strong If you open your BCSS folder and find the following file and folders, then instead of coping the BCSS folder, you should  copy these items to the root folder of the partition labeled   "FLASHDRIVE".  code$WinPEDriver/code (folder)br  codeAutoUnattend.xml/codebr  codeBootCamp/code (folder)/li liEnter the following command in the same Terminal window.  precodedot_clean  /Volumes/FLASHDRIVE /code/pre/li liMark the correct partition as active in each disk's MBR by entering  the following  in the same Terminal window.

I installed to BootCamp partition with virtual box, and added the ISO then booted to the boot menu with refit 0.92 and booted the ISO from the boot menu and install went fine.  <comment240744> old Macs cannot boot into modern Windows installers from USB, because they don't understand UEFI. See if this might be a workaround - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129661/install-windows-bootcamp-without-cd-or-usb-flash-drive?rq=1 <comment240785> Would it be somehow possible to install windows 10 in a virtual machine and copy the content onto the partition that i made with the bootcamp assistent? <comment240786> You can turn a Boot Camp partition into a VM, but not the other way round, afaik <comment240807> Okay Thanks! I have had Windows 7 installed in bootcamp previously. But i can not remember if i installed it through usb or cd. There is no way to create a "non-modern" windows installer that works on with this mac? I would just like to use boot camp. <comment240888> my first link contained a good workaround, idk of any better way, unless you want to put a DVD drive back in the machine, which is how I did mine ;) <comment241023> Thanks Tetsujin! I might have to do that, even though I wish there was an easier way. Thanks a lot for your help! <comment241033> Ok, I just installed Windows 10 on my Mac without using a DVD or USB port. I did need to install a free copy of VirtualBox to boot from the iso image. Once booted, the installation files can be copied to the physical partition. You can then exit VirtualBox and boot your Mac from this partition to install Windows 10. <comment241264> Hi David! This sounds very interesting. Can you elaborate a bit more on the process? <comment241613> If you want me to be notified that you posted a comment, you have to include a @David somewhere in your comment. Click on "help" while posting your next comment for more information. <comment243244> @DavidAnderson Hi David! This sounds very interesting. Can you elaborate a bit more on the process? And thanks for the tip :) <comment243326> I have two questions. 1) Do you want to do a clean install of Windows 10? This would be where there is no version of Windows already installed and you have a Windows 10 Product Key. Or, do you want to do a free upgrade to Windows 10? This is where a previous version of Windows is first installed on your computer and activated. 2) Which disk do you want to install to? The HHD or SSD? Is this disk identifier drive0 or drive1? (You can use the Terminal application command `diskutil  list` to get the identifiers.) Will Windows be on the same disk as OS X? <comment243783> When are you going to update this? <comment243820> I can always use an external HDD cant I? <comment243822> @iProgram: What I meant was the instructions are for a second disk that is MBR partitioned. Your disk is GPT partitioned. I will try to include the differences in the steps somewhere. <comment243823> Ok, thanks. Just that you commented on my post saying it would work. Guess you didn't think that GPT would be different. Would the differences that you say help me to install Windows or not? <comment246326> @DavidAnderson This looks amazing, thank you so much for you huge effort! <comment252625> Now that El Capitan features installment of Windows without usb, would it be possible to get this feature to work on older mac's by tinkering with the .plist files? Just wondered.. :) <comment253716> @Anders: El Captain features installing Windows without USB on only the newest Mac's and in EFI/GPT mode. My answer involves installing Windows on older Mac's using the BIOS/MBR mode. The method introduced by Apple covers a set of Mac's that would probably not include any Mac's in my set. <comment253718> @Anders: BTW, I never published how to install Windows 10 in BIOS/MBR mode on Mac with a single internal HDD or single internal SSD. I did publish how to install without an optical drive for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. As far as I know, no one has ever asked for the procedure.
