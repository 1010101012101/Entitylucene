Safari: spacing on Favorites Bar <body> Entries on my Favorites Bar seem to grow progressively farther apart. Originally, entries were each next to each other, now there is enough space to for one or two character glyphs separating them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KwMOc.png" alt="here is how it looks"  This has occurred progressively over time. Something causes the distance to increase by a pixel or thereabouts. I eventually notice this when I need to make the browser window larger to see all the entries on the bar again.   This has been going on for a few years, and I found no way to reset positions. It is annoying as my browser windows are larger than they need to be, so I can see the full bar. Any suggestions?  <comment268685> I just shorten the titles if I run out of room <comment268829> I do that too. But I hate this wasted real estate (and it is annoying that the window size keeps growing because of these useless margins).
