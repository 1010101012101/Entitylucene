Why can I open an app from Contents/MacOS/app but not by clicking the icon? <body> I have an application that is fully functional when opened from codeShow Package Contents &gt; /Contents/MacOS/app/code however when I click the icon in the codeApplications/code folder the icon just keeps bouncing. Here is the console output when the Icon is clicked:  precodeCoreServicesUIAgent[97331]: Error -60005 creating authorization kernel[0]: CODE SIGNING: cs_invalid_page(0x10a034000): p=97331[CoreServicesUIAg] final status 0x3000a00, denying page sending SIGKILL kernel[0]: CODE SIGNING: process 97331[CoreServicesUIAg]: rejecting invalid page at address 0x10a034000 from offset 0x3000 in file "/Applications/App.app/Contents/MacOS/App" (cs_mtime:1429197754.0 == mtime:1429197754.0) (signed:1 validated:1 tainted:1 wpmapped:0 slid:0) /code/pre  Can someone tell me what this means and why this would happen?  <comment215447> What happens if you right click & select Open, from the .app rather than the contents? <comment215449> The same error along with this:  `4/16/15 12:09:02.070 PM diagnosticd[62873]: error evaluating process info - pid: 958, punique: 300217`  `4/16/15 12:09:02.540 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.coreservices.uiagent[958]) Binary is improperly signed.`  `4/16/15 12:09:35.159 PM mdworker[1053]: code validation failed in the process of getting signing information: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-67062 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.

Thanks!
