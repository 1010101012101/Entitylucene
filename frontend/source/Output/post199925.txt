Can someone help me quit iPhoto on my Mac? <body> So I opened iPhoto to upload some photos. Then mid-download it stopped working. Now I can't shut down my computer or quit the iPhoto app!!  Can anyone help me?  <answer199926> Right-click or hold Control and click iPhoto in the dock, then hold down the alt/Option key and "Quit" will change to "Force Quit". Click that and it should kill it off.  <answer199945> strongForce Quit/strong unresponsive applications.  ul liClick the  Logo at the top left of your strongMenu Bar/strong and select strongForce Quit.../strong/li liThis will bring up the strongForce Quit Applications/strong dialog where you can see unresponsive and/or all running applications./li liChoose the unresponsive application (in your case iPhoto) by clicking on it./li liClick the strongForce Quit/strong Button/li /ul  This dialog can be quickly invoked by using the keyboard shortcut:  ul likbdoption ⌥/kbd+kbdcommand ⌘/kbd+kbdesc ⎋/kbd all together./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ixXpi.png" alt="Force Quit Applications Dialog"  Also, as the other answer states a right click or long press on the application's icon will bring up the dialog where you can quit the unresponsive application as well.  <comment240799> Please clarify your request.
