Blocked Plug-in in Safari 10.1 <body> I'm running El Captain 10.11.6 (15G1421) with all updates. I've recently updated to Safari 10.1 (11603.1.30.0.34) and now I get "Blocked Plug-in" whenever I click on Gmail links that lead to a PDF or even to a web page that links to a PDF.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AUZPZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Copying the link and opening it on a new window or tab works just fine! So does control-click,but not option-click or command-click.  Is there a fix or a better workaround? Can we tell Safari to always open PDFs in Preview?  Opening a console shows     Refused to load http://URL/foo.pdf because it does not appear in the object-src directive of the Content Security Policy.   Here is my full Installed Plugins list:  ul liGoogle Talk Plugin/li liGoogle Talk Plugin Video Renderer/li liJava Applet Plug-in/li liand a online banking plugin./li /ul  I do have Adobe Reader 10.1.16 installed but I don't think I've installed a browser plugin for that. The "Blocked Plug-in" message does not mention Adobe.  The problem also occurs in a different machine also running El Captain that does not have Adobe Reader.  <answer281236> Without clicking the back button (or codeCommand-[/code ) of the browser:  ol liAlthough the plugin is blocked, you can still use Command-S (or File  Save As) as well as File  Export as PDF to save the file to a folder./li /ol  Alternatively, click the back button (or codeCommand-[/code ), and then:  ol liOption-click on the original link to download the file/li liCommand-click opens the PDF in a new tab (PDF will not be blocked)/li liCtrl-click yields the option "Download linked file as"/li /ol  <answer296252> Not an answer but a clue. I am having the same problem. It started yesterday when I installed Adobe Reader DC and selected custom install and chose not to install the Adobe Reader browser extension. Before this PDFs were showing with options to open in Preview or download.  <comment350091> What plugin do you use? Adobe Reader? Then try this link (note that this is for older versions): https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/blocked-plugin-alert-safari-7.html <comment350809> See also ["Blocked Plug-In" when opening pdf from Safari](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7912093). <comment353871> Ah, you can save the file from the "Blocked Plug-in" page! I wish I could open Preview directly but the floating "bar" does not appear at the bottom. But like I said, control-click works but not option-click or command-click. <comment356210> Have you tried updating to the newest version of Adobe Reader? Seems you're a few version out of date https://get.adobe.com/reader/ <comment356263> @ToddDabney, like I said, the problem is *not* with Adobe Reader. <comment356907> Can we tell Safari to always open PDFs in Preview? <comment357279> This question was asked here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106660/how-make-safari-7-open-pdf-files-in-preview-instead-of-opening-them-in-page  Apparently, none of the methods work in the current version of Safari (10.1)
