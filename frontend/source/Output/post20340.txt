How to register Outlook 2011 to send emails from iPhoto? <body> I had Office 2008 for Mac (with Entourage) installed. I never used Entourage and didn't have any email accounts configured. Then I installed Office 2011 without 'uninstalling' 2008 and setup Outlook 2011.  However in iPhoto I only see Mail and Entourage as the options for sending mail.   Any ideas how I can get Outlook 2011 to come up in the Entourage Mail options?  I am running Snow Leopard and iPhoto that came with my late 2009 MBP.  Thanks, Sumit.  <answer20401> There is no built-in way to do this, but some poking around turned up this article, which basically involves modifying the Entourage script to use Outlook instead. The instructions are for iPhoto '09, but the comments indicate that it should work with iPhoto '11.  <comment22563> Fantastic pointer. Thanks. I followed the steps in the above article and was able to successfully connect iPhoto ('09) to send mails via Outlook 11.
