Error writing on SD card (Error code -50) <body> On MacBook Air Early 2014 macOS Sierra v10.12.5 I am facing error code -50 (An Unexpected error occurred) when I want to write on SD card. Would you please help me?   Best Regards,  <comment361036> Have you tested against another SD card? They're very delicate & easily fail. <comment361037> This SD card is an extension on my memory (128 GB) and it works well on other devices. <comment361038> "an extension on my memory" ? I don't understand what that's supposed to mean.
