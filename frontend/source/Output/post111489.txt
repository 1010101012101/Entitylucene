Google Calendar set up failed <body> I was trying to set up Google Calendar on my new Mac. After following the steps from this Google support article, I ran into this absolutely useless error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QM39M.png" width="500"  Any ideas how to fix it?  <answer111502> While setting up the Calendar, when my wifi was disconnected I got the same message. Then I used my 3G modem for fast and continuous connection. It resolved the issue.
