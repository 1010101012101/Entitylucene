Can't get Windows to boot after editing partitions <body> When I attempt to boot Windows I get the error 0xc000000e. This happened after I made a partition in Windows and then deleted it in Mac OS.  Here's my current set up. Is it possible to repair it using GDisk? I've added a description of each partition to the list.  precode    *** Report for internal hard disk ***      Current GPT partition table:      #      Start LBA      End LBA  Type      1             40       409639  EFI System   (FAT)      2         409640    166400863  Mac OS X HFS+   (Mac OS)      3      167731200    169062399  Mac OS X HFS+   (Recovery)      4      169062400    215558143  Basic Data   (New Partition)      5      215558144    368127999  Basic Data   (Bootcamp)      6      368128000    369049599  Unknown   (Don't know how this got here)      7      369049600    490231807  Basic Data   (Files)      Current MBR partition table:  # A    Start LBA      End LBA  Type  1              1       409639  ee  EFI Protective  2 *       409640    166400863  af  Mac OS X HFS+  3      169062400    215558143  07  NTFS/HPFS  4 *    215558144    368127999  07  NTFS/HPFS  MBR contents:  Boot Code: None  Partition at LBA 40:  Boot Code: Windows BOOTMGR (Vista)  File System: FAT32  Listed in GPT as partition 1, type EFI System (FAT)  Partition at LBA 409640:  Boot Code: None  File System: HFS Extended (HFS+)  Listed in GPT as partition 2, type Mac OS X HFS+  Listed in MBR as partition 2, type af  Mac OS X HFS+, active  Partition at LBA 167731200:  Boot Code: None  File System: HFS Extended (HFS+)  Listed in GPT as partition 3, type Mac OS X HFS+  Partition at LBA 169062400:  Boot Code: None (Non-system disk message)  File System: FAT32  Listed in GPT as partition 4, type Basic Data  Listed in MBR as partition 3, type 07  NTFS/HPFS  Partition at LBA 215558144:  Boot Code: Windows BOOTMGR (Vista)  File System: NTFS  Listed in GPT as partition 5, type Basic Data  Listed in MBR as partition 4, type 07  NTFS/HPFS, active  Partition at LBA 368128000:  Boot Code: Windows BOOTMGR (Vista)  File System: NTFS  Listed in GPT as partition 6, type Unknown  Partition at LBA 369049600:  Boot Code: Windows BOOTMGR (Vista)  File System: NTFS  Listed in GPT as partition 7, type Basic Data /code/pre  I've tried to recreate the deleted partition (4) and added it to the MBR block. It still doesn't work.  <comment251876> Golden Rule - never let Windows touch the partitions, it simply doesn't understand how they are constructed. <comment251879> Last time I did it, it worked fine. <comment251885> Windows is unaware that the volume it thinks is MBR is actually GUID underneath. Boot Camp 'fools' it into thinking it's MBR. <comment251893> Great, so how do I fix this mess? <comment251898> I'd hope @klanomath reads this thread - he's bona fide wizard at this stuff - or search some of his answers in Ask Different .. http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/93229/klanomath <comment251906> I get the impression that I could set the MBR to any combination and wouldn't work.
