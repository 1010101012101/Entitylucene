Disable OS X Portable Home Directories for specific hosts for all users, not just individuals? <body> Would it be possible to block any and all Portable Home Directory services for specific hosts? Something like MCX's "MobileAccountNeverAsk-" but for the whole workstation? We have a network with both portable and stationary machines. I'd like our users to be able to use all machines, going portable on the MacBook but not being bothering with syncing when logged into stationary iMacs or Mac Pros.  The Open Directory servers are running Snow Leopard (for now) and all clients are running Lion.  Thanks!  Paul
