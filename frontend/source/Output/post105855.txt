Turn OFF the white flash WITH 10.8.5 - the old solution is no longer an option <body> I have ALREADY tried:  ol liWithin the System Preferences/Accessibility:  De-Select Flash the screen when an alert appears. /li liToggling Select then back to De-Select /li liWhile I found the solution to delete:  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist - 10.8.5 replaced Universal Access with "Accessibility", which has no apparent equivalent file within the Lib/prefs.  If there IS, please let me know./li /ol  I really hate the white flash.  REALLY hate it.  BTW: I did do my own research before asking this question, including on this AskDifferent website.  The solution found on AskDifferent and other sites only work on older Mac systems (up to ~ 2011).  The ones with UniversalAccess.  Thanks, in advance for any useful input. - Scott  <answer105858> The plist you listed is the correct one to remove. Remove it and try rebooting, and your problem should be resolved. If not, create a new user account and log into it, and see if the problem persists.
