What type of storage does an iPod classic use? <body> I am interested to know if a newer generation iPod classic uses a standard hard drive or flash memory. Do you know what type of memory an iPod classic uses?  <answer46031> The specs page for the iPod Classic says "hard drive". That's a mechanical drive with a set of spinning platters and read/write heads.  And here's a replacement part for the drive in the unit. The compatibility list on that page lists:  ul liiPod 6th Gen 160GB/li liiPod 7th Gen 160GB/li /ul  And here's a video that gives some details on the Samsung drive in the unit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mB3xjIIKcU  <answer46033> All generations of the iPod classic use a hard-drive for storage. That's what the Apple's tech specs specify, as well as Wikipedia.  <answer46034> Capacity:  precode160GB hard drive* /code/pre  *1GB = 1 billion bytes; actual formatted capacity less.  <answer46035> The iPod Classic Models use 'mechanical' stronghard drive platters/strong. That is the round disk that also hard disk drives have. You notice this by the strongnoise/strong they make.  <answer46053> It uses an old hard drive with magnetic discs.   <comment52506> You are *far* too kind ;) <comment52507> Go big or go home, I say. :) <comment52508> Edited the question to make it *marginally* quicker to type than to visit `Apple.com/ipod` and click `Classic` then `Specs`. <comment52510> No, really *far too kind*
