How to add music from iTunes to my iPhone after enabling iCloud Music Library? <body> When I enabled iCloud Music Library on my iPhone, I had the option of merging it with my existing music. I did that, and my phone has both music from my iTunes library and music from Apple Music on it.  Now, I want to add some more music from my iTunes library to the phone.  Before I enabled iCloud Music Library, there was a setting in iTunes that let me pick a playlist to use to sync (Settings - Music). Now, with iCloud Music Library enabled, that option is gone and there's just a toggle to sync voice memos. And I can see a way to edit my phone's music library (On My Device - Music - Edit Playlist), but when I drag an album into it, nothing happens.  I was able to work around this by doing the following:  ol liDisable iCloud Music Library on my iPhone/li liPlug the phone into my computer/li liSync with iTunes/li liDisconnect phone from my computer/li liRe-enable iCloud Music Library on my iPhone, and pick Merge again./li /ol  So obviously this is possible, but there has to be a better way than this. The last step, especially, takes a while. And, it looks like I need to tell it t ore-download all of the Apple Music songs if I want to listen to them offline.  I found this on Apple's website, but it involves turning on iCloud Music Library in iTunes, and I don't think I want that.  I also found this question but it seems the advice there is to repeat the steps I outlined above.
