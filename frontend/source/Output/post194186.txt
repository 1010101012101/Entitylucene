Terminal Command Line to find corrupted files <body> I do have just one corrupted photo into my Photos Library.  Is there is any UNIX command line that I can use in terminal in order to scan my Photos Library Folder and find out which file is corrupted?  <answer194191> My first thought was that ImageMagick is bound to have something for this, and indeed it does. You could run something like this  precodefind . -name "*.JPG" -exec identify {} \; | grep Corrupt /code/pre  where you can replace code./code with your directory of choice (it will descend recursively) to check each file or image with ImageMagick's codeidentify/code command. Grepping for 'Corrupt' will print you codeidentify/codes output for those files which are in fact corrupt. You could probably trim the output to make it more readable, which would involve some regexing for codegrep/code.  Obviously, you need to have ImageMagick installed for this. If you use MacPorts, it's as simple as codesudo port install ImageMagick/code.
