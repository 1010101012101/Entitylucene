How do I find a list of available printers on a specific print server? <body> Is there a way to find a list of available printers on a given server like you can on a PC?  For example, my school hosts all of their printers on one server.  When I run windows, I can do a run command for the address of the server (ex. \server.school.edu), and it will open up an explorer window with all of the printers that are available.  However, when I try and connect to the same server via OS X, it simply asks what drives I would like to mount and there is nothing there.  <answer50578> ol ligo to System Preferences  print&amp; fax./li licreate new printer. Depending on yor version of Mac OS X,either ("+") below list of existing printers, or "Set up Printer button" at top of window then click "Add"./li liChoose printer connection type.

It appears that it's not really possible to "browse" in the same way that I was referring to on OS X, unless I'm missing something.
