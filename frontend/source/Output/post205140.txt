Share internet connection from iPad to iPhone via bluetooth <body> I can share my iPad's internet connection using Bluetooth to my Macbook Pro and my Android phone but my iPad and iPhone does not even seem to see each other when I try to pair them. I am abroad at the moment and have put a local SIM in my iPad and want to share the connection. Is this even possible? I can go iPad &lt;-- BT -- some other device &lt;-- WiFi -- iPhone but it feels stupid and is a waste of battery for no use at all!  <answer206360> strongpersonal hotspot without WiFi/strong  ol liActivate Personal Hotspot in Settings/li liDisable WiFi/li /ol  iOS and OS X devices will use Bluetooth when possible over WiFi, so no need for the above.   <comment247411> Are you not able to use the iPad as a mobile hotspot? In that situation, just share the connection over WiFi instead of bluetooth. <comment247470> Yes, but that is waste of battery.
