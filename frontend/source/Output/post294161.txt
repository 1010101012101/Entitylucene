Resize an operating system's partition? <body> I recently partitioned my 250 GB SSD to install Elementary OS using Disk Utility. I dedicated 100 GB to Elementary OS and the rest to macOS. I now want to resize the partitions to change Elementary OS to 30 GB and give macOS the rest. Before I installed Elementary OS, the partition was visible in Disk Utility, but now Disk Utility says that the main drive is only 150 GB and only shows the main partition.  macOS version: Sierra 10.12.6  I don't want to buy any partitioning software.  Output of codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            150.8 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s3    4:                        EFI                         99.2 GB    disk0s4  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +150.4 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  8192329B-C977-47CC-A86C-C0025E670A61                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  <comment371272> It' still there but you made it an EFI partition (disk0s4/99.2 GB) <comment371273> @klanomath Didn't see it there! How do I resize it, though? I've never used the `diskutil` command line tools. <comment371276> `diskutil resizeVolume disk0s4 30g` and then `diskutil cs resizeStack 8192329B-C977-47CC-A86C-C0025E670A61 219600m` should work but may render ElementaryOS un-bootable. <comment371386> @klanomath "Unable to resize because file system volume format does not support resizing"... Could I format the partition first?
