Can I use Apple Pay in the US with an Australian AMEX? <body> I'm travelling from Australia to the US. Apple Pay isn't available in Australia yet.   My question is: strongCan I use Apple Pay in the US with an Australian AMEX?/strong  <answer156777> Short answer: No, you can't.  Long answer: Apple Pay is, officially, US-only right now. However, it is possible to use Apple Pay in Australia:     To show the Apple Pay settings, simply open the Settings app on your iPhone (or iPad mini 3 or iPad Air 2), tap on General, Tap on Language &amp; Region, and tap on ‘Region’. Change it to the United States.   However, there is a big caveat:     While you can go through the setup process, your card must be issued by a participating bank before it can be used with Apple Pay. If you try to add a card from a bank that isn’t yet supported (i.e a card from, or issued in Australia), you’ll simply receive an error.   The Apple support article Apple Pay participating issuers lists the currently-supported banks.  So, while you could use it in Australia with a US-issued card, the reverse is not possible.  <comment184348> AFIK-At this time the Apple Pay only accepts credit cards that are issued in the USA.
