How to create an app with the ability to open files in finder with right click <body> I want to create a very simple app like this:  precode#!/bin/sh /opt/local/bin/evince $1 /code/pre  evince is a pdf viewer I compiled in OS X.  I want to navigate to a pdf document in finder and then right click and choose to open it with evince. So  ol liI created an app with Platypus(http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) using the former script/li liI navigated to a pdf document and right click and choose to open it with the created app/li /ol  However, nothing happens.  Then I tried to figure out how OS X executes my command when I right click and choose an app, so I created an app with the following script:  precode#!/bin/sh echo $0 echo $1 echo $2 echo $3 /code/pre  then I chose a pdf document and right click and open. The output was, surprisingly,  precode/Users/chongwang/Evince.app/Contents/Resources/script -psn_0_1327428  /code/pre  .  It didn't even include the filename I chose!  Can anyone help me?
