Hibernate mode 25 for filevault messing with apps on wake <body> I recently started using Filevault 2 to encrypt my hard drive. I read that due to security  vulnerabilities, it was recommended to change the sleep settings via  codesudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 hibernatemode 25/code  This is all good and everything, but I think it's messing with some of my apps permissions upon waking the computer from hibernating? I've noticed at minimum that JiTouch and Cloudapp stop functioning correctly- jitouch completely, and cloudapp stops autouploading screenshots. It's fixed by quitting the apps and reopening, but that's kind of a hassle to do every time I open my Macbook.  Is there a way to tweak settings so apps keep their same permission set after waking?  I'm running Mountain Lion.
