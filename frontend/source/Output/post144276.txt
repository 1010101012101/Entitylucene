Extract lines from txt file and save as new txt <body> I have a xyz.txt file looking quite like this:  precode001this is line one 002this is line two 003and this is line three 004and so on /code/pre  Now I need all those lines as a single txt without the three digit prefix, like:  lineone.txt  precodethis is line one /code/pre  linetwo.txt  precodethis is line two /code/pre  And so on. The filenames must not be x(+number).txt. They will all have different names, like content.txt (for line 1) or header.txt (for line 2).  I plan to run this on my Mac with sed or Bash or anything else that works.  <answer144312> A Perl one-liner that strips all leading digits from every line can be written with the regular expression codes/^\d+//g/code. You can run it like so:  precode|ruby-2.1.1| cortana in ~/tmp/ad ○ → cat input 001this is line one 002this is line two 003and this is line three 004and so on  |ruby-2.1.1| cortana in ~/tmp/ad ○ → perl -i.bak -pe 's/^\d+//g' input  |ruby-2.1.1| cortana in ~/tmp/ad ○ → cat input this is line one this is line two and this is line three and so on  |ruby-2.1.1| cortana in ~/tmp/ad ○ → cat input.bak 001this is line one 002this is line two 003and this is line three 004and so on /code/pre  <comment169958> I plan to run this on may mac with sed or bash or anything else that works. <comment169959> This is really a give us the code question which is not really answered here. I would note though you do not give enough information to solve the problem as what should the output files be named
