How to reset Launchpad ordering in OS X Yosemite? <body> Previously I can remove the files end with codedb/code in code~/Library/Application Support/Dock//code to reset the ordering of apps, but now doing the same thing doesnâ€™t help. Do anyone know where the new path that organizes the Launchpad is located?  <answer150973> Enter this line in the console:  precodedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock /code/pre  Removing the db doesn't seem to do the trick any more. So this two steps are necessary to reset the Launchpad in Yosemite:     ol   lirm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db ; killall Dock/li   lidefaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock/li   /ol   <answer155869> Here Launchpad resets, when deleting the three database files in...  precode/private/var/folders/02/yff1cxtx61v3y1pydkt96j2h0000gn/0/com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db /private/var/folders/02/yff1cxtx61v3y1pydkt96j2h0000gn/0/com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db-shm /private/var/folders/02/yff1cxtx61v3y1pydkt96j2h0000gn/0/com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db-wal /code/pre  ...and restarting the Dock: codekillall Dock/code  I get there by opening   precodeopen $TMPDIR../0/com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/ /code/pre  <answer170472> precoderm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db rm "/$TMPDIR../0/com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db*" defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock /code/pre  <answer175161> Starting in Yosemite, simply running codekillall Dock/code wont always cut it when altering your codedefaults/code.  In Yosemite the codedefaults/code are now cached in two separate persistent processes called codecfprefsd/code; one owned by you, code$USER/code, and the other owned by coderoot/code, so you essentially need to restart these processes.  You can verify this by opening up Activity Monitor.app and searching for codecfprefsd/code  (There can actually be more than two of these process in some circumstances, not to worry though!)  I added the following one liner to my shell profile of choice (.zshrc) so that it is easily available to me anytime by just typing codefixpref/code, but you also can just cut out the good parts to use it once!  TL;DR:  precode#!/bin/bash # Clear defaults caches, reload them, and then kill everything! alias fixpref='sudo killall -SIGKILL cfprefsd &amp;&amp; killall Dock &amp;&amp; killall Finder' /code/pre  <comment178206> Killing Dock once is enough from my try: `rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db; defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock` <comment243077> this does not work anymore either
