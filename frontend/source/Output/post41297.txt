How can I extract the *.icns from the Get Info dialog? <body> Previously, I've changed the icon of an application before by manually replacing the icon file code.icns/code located in codeloremipsum.app/Contents/Resources/loremipsum.icns/code.  This time, I've downloaded some beautiful icons which are folders with the needed icon and not simple code.icns/code files.  How can I get access of the the code*.icns/code file?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CSN4W.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer41302> You can mark it in the Get Info dialog, go Edit → Copy, switch to Preview, and select File → New from clipboard.  <answer41303> There's no need to edit a resource bundle. You can copy the icon from an existing folder, file or application by selecting it and choosing emGet Info/em from the Finder strongFile/strong menu or by using the keyboard shortcut kbd⌘/kbd + kbdi/kbd.  Select the icon file in the upper left hand corner by clicking on it once. The emcopy/em the file. I use kbd⌘/kbd + kbdc/kbd for this. Now emGet Info/em for the application you want to use the icon for. Select it's icon, and empaste/em the new icon into the application using kbd⌘/kbd + kbdv/kbd.  <answer49385> You can use the free iCondubber, which is a sort of universal icon manager/converter.  <comment46787> Let me get this straight. You have an application for which you'd like to change the icon, and you can't figure out where it stores its icon file? <comment46789> Or, from the title of your question, maybe you just want to get the icon from the app. You can mark it in the Get Info dialog, go Edit → Copy, switch to Preview, and select File → New from clipboard. <comment46790> I know where the application's icon is located. The problem is that the icon I want to replace it with is not stored in a *.icns file. I only got the folder like in the picture. <comment46792> I see. Shouldn't the question then be about how to create a `*.icns` file (from existing graphics)? <comment46793> Is that what were are doing here? Like converting a thumbnail to a *.icns? <comment46794> Ho hum. Posts crossing paths. Answer posted. <comment46797> Thanks! While this is true, I really wanted the `.icns` file. <comment273976> This app does not exist anymore, sorry but we have to downvote till you remove it. Nothing personal ;)
