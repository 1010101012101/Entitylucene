How can I get the hexadecimal functionality of Digital ColorMeter back? <body> I often used Digital ColorMeter to capture colours as hex codes for web development. For some reason, Lion's version has removed a whole load of functionality, including this. Some people have managed to copy over the Lion version with their Snow Leopard version, but my Mac tells my that it's required by OSX and can't be deleted. Can anyone work out a way to do the method described by these people?  <answer18424> In lieu of DigitalColor Meter, I've been using an alternative.  ol liOpen up AppleScript Editor/li liEnter the words codechoose color/code and go to Save. Make it an application./li liYou now have a pop-up colour chooser. Unfortunately, there's no inbuilt hex display. Luckily, Waffle Software have made a plugin that gives you the hex of any colour./li /ol  <answer30834> Select emView → Display Values → as Hexadecimal/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRp5B.png" alt="menu in DigitalColor Meter to enable hex display"  Now the main window displays hex values:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dmgvi.png" alt="DigitalColor Meter in hex view"  Also, emColor → Copy Color as Text/em kbd⇧⌘C/kbd will now format the color like code#C8D8E8/code (instead of code200 216 232/code).  <comment20113> You can remove the new version with Terminal: `sudo rm -rf /Applications/Utilities/DigitalColor\ Meter.app/` However, Snow Leopard DCM crashes in Lion, making the whole endeavour a bit of a fool's errand. <comment20291> Great question, great answer - thanks! <comment61611> Instead of the first two steps, you can download [an application already generated in that way](https://www.robinwood.com/Catalog/Technical/OtherTuts/MacColorPicker/ColorPicker.zip), linked from the bottom of [this document about the Mac OS X Color Picker](https://www.robinwood.com/Catalog/Technical/OtherTuts/MacColorPicker/MacColorPicker.html). And that app even comes with a cool-looking custom icon.
