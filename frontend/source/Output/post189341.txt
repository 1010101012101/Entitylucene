Please help me to order that disk to install my Macbook  <answer189359> I think what you mean is the restore disk that came with the computer. If so your best bet is to just call the Apple Store and speak to a sales rep. Those kind of things are generally unavailable on the web site or stores but are available through Apple itself.  Apple Contact info here.  <comment224504> The question is what Operating System do you want? <comment224532> If you can get to an Apple Store, you can ask them to just install whatever OS X you want. Note: it will be a fresh install so make sure you have a backup of whatever is on your computer. Another Note: you must have 4 GB of ram to install any OS beyond Snow Leopard. (Snow leopard requires 2GB)
