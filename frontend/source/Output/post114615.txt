What's the minimum partition size for osx mavericks when dual booting with windows 8? <body> I used boot camp to setup dual booting between windows 8 and mac osx mavericks.  To get the most possible space for Windows 8, should I have formatted my computer first?  I was able to partition my drive as:  ul li205 GB OSX /li li18 GB Available 295 GB Win8/li /ul  It is a 500 GB hard drive.  If I formatted it first, could I have made the OSX partition smaller? If so, how much smaller?  <answer114616> OS X Mavericks requires at least 8 GB of free space to install to. At least 15% of free space is recommended for updates and other such things.  strongTherefore, the minimum space for OS X is 9.2 GB, or to be safe, 10 GB./strong  hr  So yes, using Disk Utility to partition before you installed Boot Camp would have meant that you could have made the OS X partition smaller.  You can repartition now with software such as iPartition, which specifically works with Boot Camp partitions.
