Switching to #x application in the dock <body> I would like to hit cmd+X to switch to (or launch, if it's not running) the #X application in the Dock, without hardconding that application.  I.e. if my third application in the dock is the Terminal, I hit cmd+3 and I switch to the terminal, but if I then move Adium to that position, cmd+3 automatically opens Adium.  Can this be done on OSX 10.8 (or 10.9)?  Even better, though that's not required, if in case I hit the combination of the already active application, it hides it instead.  <answer108140> With AppleScript you can do something like that :   precodetell application "System Events"     click item # of UI elements of list 1 of process "Dock" end tell /code/pre  But the actual problem is binding it to the shortcuts.   Edit:As Lauri Ranta reminded me by his anwers, there is FastScripts.   <answer108141> You could save one AppleScript for clicking each Dock icon:  codefor i in {1..9};do echo 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "Dock" to click UI element '$i' of list 1'&gt;~/Library/Scripts/Focus\ Application\ $i.applescript;done/code  Then use FastScripts to assign shortcuts to the scripts.  I find it easier to just assign keyboard shortcuts for applications though.  <comment126781> _(if someone has a better title for this, please edit, thanks)_ <comment126785> I'll leave it open for a while, just in case someone comes up with an application which does that.
