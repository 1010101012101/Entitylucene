Symlinks to executables in `/Applications` cannot run <body> I'm trying to create a symlink to emacs, in order to let git use it as default editor.  precodeln -s /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs emacs /code/pre  Calling code/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs/code directly from terminal works.  Calling code./emacs/code in that folder gives a pop-up that says:     "This application will not run on your computer. Sorry!"   The symlink has permissions coderwxr-xr-x/code.  I don't feel this is related to emacs, I've tried other applications. For example chess:  precode$ /Applications/Chess.app/Contents/MacOS/Chess # working $ ln -s /Applications/Chess.app/Contents/MacOS/Chess chess $ ./chess 2017-04-19 14:39:05.479 chess[16972:4178764] No Info.plist file in application bundle or no NSPrincipalClass in the Info.plist file, exiting /code/pre  How can I make a working executable symlink to an application in code/Applications/code?  (next step is to go through a script instead of a symlink, but I'd rather use a symlink.)  <comment353920> Is there a reason not to just make the symlink to the app (.app) instead of something within its contents? <comment354017> @NoahL: I'm not sure I get what you mean. It's a directory?
