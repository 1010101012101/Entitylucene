list box in applescript? <body> I'm trying to have users pick a department from a list box. And then that choice is stored in a variable as string.  How can I do this?  I have code written like this:  precodeset deptList to {"dept1", "dept2", "dept3", "dept4"}  set dept_name to {choose from my list deptList} /code/pre  when I run the script, I get this error.      " doesn't understand   the "choose" message". number -1708 from    Am I writing this code wrong?  <answer123861> You were close you had an errant 'my' which you do not need.  precodeset deptList to {"dept1", "dept2", "dept3", "dept4"}      set dept_name to {choose from list deptList} /code/pre  Also you should pay attention to the colour code of the text. this will give you a clue as what the Applescript thinks the syntax is you have typed  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8eQ8F.png" alt="enter image description here"
