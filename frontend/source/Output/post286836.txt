Profile won't push to device <body> I'm trying to push a profile to an iMac running Sierra but it is stuck "pending". The server Mac Mini is on Mavericks (10.9.5) with Server 3.2.1. I am concerned that it could be due to the version difference but I'm not sure where to start troubleshooting.  This is my first time attempting to push a profile out and I believe I've set it up correctly. All my certificates are up to date, I've installed the Trust profile and enrolled the client by going to the web address (http:///mydevices). It shows up in profile manager and the tasks appear but never complete. Firewall is not turned on.  Where would I begin to start troubleshooting this? I've had a look at the profile manager log but I can't see anything jumping out at me so if I could find a starting point, that'd be great.
