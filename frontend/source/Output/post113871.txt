Linking my mac to a monitor but my backlight has gone <body> The back light on my mac screen has failed and I have the correct cables/connections to link to a monitor. The signal is coming through fine as I can see my wall paper. All my icons and files are to the "left" of the monitor screen, off screen but there. I can not get into system preferences to make the necessary changes as it is off screen.  Does anyone know how I might be able to get round this problem. Thanks.

It is an older mac, 2008 I think. How can I check this? <comment133594> Thank you so much that worked right away! Really appreciate this.
