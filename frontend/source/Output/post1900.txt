iPhone custom label in contacts <body> I am having trouble saving a contact with a custom label in iOS4. I received a phone call from a number not stored in my phone. After the call, I clicked the blue chevron next to the number  Create New Contact  Entered name info  click "mobile"  Add Custom Label  Entered my label name  Save     At this point, the phone number shows up correctly, with the custom tag. When I press Done, it goes back to the "mobile" tag.    I was able to do this in 3.x. Is this an iOS4 bug?  <answer1901> I did this when editing a contact a few days ago. So the functionality is there.   <comment1630> Ditto, I was able to do the same in iOS4 on an iPhone4. <comment1631> Thanks for the info guys. Mine still won't work though. I filed a bug report. Strange. <comment10971> my iphone 4 ( only one week old, with iOS 4.3 installed 5 days ago), HAD custom labels but now doesnt.  Did it go away between 4.2 and 4.3   ??? <comment59545> Do you sync your contacts with google? If so, than you can't sync custom labels. <comment59658> Nope I didn't sync contacts with Google. But this was 3 iPhones ago lol. It's not an issue anymore. Thanks for the reply though!
