Cmd + Opt + F stopped working <body> kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdF/kbd should allow me to access the search box in many applications. It doesn't anymore though.  I have Karabiner running, but haven't specifically done anything with that combination. Just kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdF/kbd is assigned. When watching the keyboard events in the EventViewer, that comes with Karabiner, pressing the kbdF/kbd doesn't register at all.  I remember that is has been working on and off before. Can't pin that down though. The global keyboard shortcut overview in the preferences doesn't show any action assigned to kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdF/kbd.  I am on El Capitan 10.11.6  What could be the issue? How can I further debug this?  <comment314319> I agree that Cmd + F is the standard search shortcut. But some applications, like Evernote, allow search on different levels. In the case of Evernote a search within the current node (Cmd + F) and a search for a note (Cmd + Opt + F). I wasn't clear on the Eventviewer thing. I do not have any other issues with the F key, only when Cmd and Opt are already pressed <comment314365> Wouldn't that imply that there is an interdependence between key states and events on the hardware level? From all I know about this stuff, that's all worked out in the OS and the keyboard only sends KeyUp and KeyDown events. If it's the keyboard, I'll have to face that, but I just don't see a high chance that it is. I'll switch off Karabiner and see what happens... <comment314371> True, I accidentially mispresented that in my OP. In my comment I added "I wasn't clear on the Eventviewer thing. I do not have any other issues with the F key, only when Cmd and Opt are already pressed". I'll switch it all off, test with Key Codes and report. Thx <comment314424> I switched off Karabiner and Keyboard Maestro. Makes no difference. Neither EventViewer nor Key Codes shows the firing of the F key when Cmd + Opt are pressed. I tried with all other modifier combinations and they work. And I looked through the global keyboard shortcuts in the settings again. Cmd + Opt + F is not used. But when I try to assign that combination as a global hotkey to some function it does work! That finally rules out the hardware issue :-) <comment331741> I still have the problem. What can I do? P.S.: It look like I am talking to myself above, but there were comments from another user, that he must have deleted. God knows why...
