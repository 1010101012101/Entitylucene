Remove horizontal scrolling in finder with big thumbnail view <body> This is an overflow problem. Like in this picture, there is two scrollbars, you need a horizontal + vertical scrolling ? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhHzs.png" alt="thumbnail"  Is there a way to fix that ?  EDIT : I found a tip by using 'sort by name'.  <answer106740> As you said, you can enable sorting files automatically by changing the Sort By or Arrange By mode from None to Name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/anyWV.png" alt=""  If others search for how to for example sort files by modification date without grouping them under these sections with horizontal scroll bars  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7gLB.png" alt=""  you can set View  Arrange By to None and set View  Sort By (shown when holding option) to Date Modified.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nnChg.png" alt=""
