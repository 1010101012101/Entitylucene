Can I listen to iPhone audio in my PC? <body> I'm using Windows 7, and have my headset almost always connected to the laptop.  However, sometimes I need to hear something from the iPhone, and I need to take off the headset, connect it to the iPhone, hear, then switch back.  Is there any way to make it so the iPhone plays everything (wirelessly) in my PC?  <comment180259> Yes there it is, but you will still have to switch the input source otherwise you wont hear you PC anymore. <comment180389> @Buscarì›ƒ that's fine, I prefer it that way. Could you please tell me more?
