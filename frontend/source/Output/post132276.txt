Can I browse all the words in single list view in the Mavericks dictionary? <body> So I'm riding the Mavericks to a rodeo - OS X 10.9.2 :)  The built-in dictionary is way cool, but is there a way to browse all the words in the dictionary? Like, there will be a list of all words on the left of the screen, from "A" to the very last word, say "zygote (or not^^)". So can I embrowse all words/em, rather than emlook up a certain word/em?  <answer132299> I think the best you can do in the built-in Dictionary.app is type a single letter in the search box, like "a" and get a list of up to a 1000 words that begin with it.  You could also write a simple app of your own and use Apple's API for accessing the system dictionaries: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/DictionaryServicesProgGuide/access/access.html  <comment155562> That's what I thought too, but there is no way to enumerate through the defined terms. There is nothing in the documented API to get a list of words that start with a string. There is a class called 'DictionaryRecordRepository' that I found in the class-dump of Dictionary.app executable that contains a few promising methods: + (id)recordRepositoryWithSearchString:(id)arg1; in DictionaryRecordRepository but this is private..
