Bootcamp - No ISO Option <body> There is no option in the Bootcamp wizard to choose the Windows ISO.. Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NUXBD.png" alt="bootcamp"  <answer170764> This is correct. You need to have a bootable media with Windows on it to install Windows on bootcamp. When the process reboots to install Windows, the .iso will be unmounted and useless.  You can write the ISO to a flash drive (8GB or more) using disk utility and use that.  <answer170798> Actually, if I recall correctly, the Bootcamp installer should make the bootable install media (8GB flash drive) itself.  If you just mount the ISO so that it shows up as a disk (double click on the ISO) that may be all you need to do. The BootCamp Assistant will then see the file as a (virtual) drive and copy the necessary files to your install media.  <answer170831> If the "Create a Windows 7 or later install disk" check box does not appear, then an USB flash drive can not be used to install Windows on your Mac. An example of this check box is shown below. Since your Mac does not show this check box, I assume you have an optical drive. You need to burn the iso image to a blank DVD using the Disk Utility application.  Now there are ways to make this check box appear so the files can be copied to the flash drive, but most likely the firmware in your Mac will not allow you to boot Windows from a flash drive. Even if you can boot to OS X using a flash drive, this does not mean you can boot to Windows using a flash drive. You need to boot to Windows from the optical drive to install it on to your internal drive.  Steps to burn an iso to DVD: (Taken from Burn ISO in Mac OS X)  ol liOpen the “Disk Utility” app, it’s located in /Applications/Utilities//li liPull down the File menu and select ‘Open Disk Image’/li liNavigate to the ISO image file that you want burned and click “OK”/li liInsert a Blank DVD/li liSelect "Verify burned data"/li liClick ‘Burn’ and wait until the image has finished burning to the disc/li /ol  As for the drivers for Windows. You can either download them using the Boot Camp Assistant or download them from Boot Camp: System requirements for Microsoft Windows operating systems. You install the drivers after you finish installing Windows.  One final note: Do not change the partitioning using anything from Microsoft. The partitioning can only be successfully changed using OS X software. The only exception is Windows can format the BOOTCAMP partition.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O4cf2.png" alt="Boot Camp Assistant Window"  <answer192687> I followed this tutor here and got success: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE8If6gabUI.  The "Create a Windows 7 install disk" option is hidden because your system's capabilities are limited. For instance, older Macs can not boot from external USB disks, therefore creating an installer onto a USB disk would make no sense.  Still, if you want to create an installer on an external disk regardless, all you have to do is edit Boot Camp Assistant's "Info.plist" file:     ol   liOpen Package content of Boot Camp Assistant app, backup codeInfo.plist/code file somewhere, then open the old one with XCode./li   liEdit file:      ul   liEdit section's title: codePreUSBBootSupportedModels/code to codeUSBSupportedModels/code (if it's already codeUSBBootSupportedModels/code - skip   this step)/li   liAdd your System's codemodel identifier/code(Find it by codeSystem Information/code app) into codeUSBSupportedModels/code section. /li   liAdd your codeBoot ROM version/code (Find by codeSystem Information/code app) to codeDARequiredROMVersions/code section/li   liSave./li   /ul/li   liRestart BootCamp/li   /ol   A comment of @dusanvf:     If your Bootcamp crashes after this, write this into terminal:  precodesudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app/ /code/pre   <answer199427> Here is the page which helped me to enable this option Create a Windows Install USB on OS X Yosemite.     Creating a Windows installer from OS X is actually quite simple - Boot Camp Assistant can do it for you. If you’re on a newer machine without an optical drive, you probably have an option that says “Create a Windows 7 or later version install disk”. Click that and point it to your ISO image. Done.      If you’re on an older machine (like my Hoth), you won’t find this option. Don’t Panic! Hacking Boot Camp Assistant into small bits and reassembling it will do the trick.      First of all, we’ll modify Boot Camp Assistant’s Info.plist. It’s at code/Applications/Utilities/Boot Camp Assistant.app/Contents/Info.plist/code. Open it in your favorite text editor. (Note: this requires elevated privileges).      emNote: If you are running OS X 10.11 or newer, you will be unable to edit codeInfo.plist/code. Instead, copy codeBoot Camp Assistant.app/code to your desktop, and follow the instructions using the copy./em      Once we’re in codeInfo.plist/code, we’ll tell it which machines can create USB disks. Look for the key PreUSBBootSupportedModels. Change it to USBBootSupportedModels. Makes sense, right? Save.      Then, we’ll need to resign Boot Camp Assistant, otherwise it will refuse to run. For this, we’ll need the Xcode command line tools installed. Then it’s as easy as  precodesudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app /code/pre      Now restart Boot Camp Assistant, and you’ll find the option you were looking for.   <answer214628> Here as an article that describes how to get the option back http://tsentas.net/create-a-windows-7-or-later-version-install-disk-missing-on-el-capitan/  <comment200850> Is the computer a Macbook Pro (Early 2008) by any chance? If you have a optical drive, then burn the iso to a DVD using the Disk Utility application and install using that. I assume you are installing windows 7. You probably can also install windows 8 on that machine. <comment212082> My solution was found here  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/168808/install-windows-7-with-bootcamp-on-os-x-yosemite-with-usb-key/178986#178986 <comment229425> Hi @samthui7, welcome to Ask Different. Please summarize the contents of the tutorial in your response to make your answer more useful to the community. This page may be of help too: http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer. Thanks! <comment240041> I believe the question is about the fact that Apple's own docs (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468) as well as BCA on modern Macs will offer an option to choose an .iso whereas here the option is not available, and he's trying to figure out how to make it available. And I suspect that's a behavior of older Macs (my Mac Pro 2009 does the same), and those Macs can't boot Windows off a USB flash drive, either. <comment240043> Correction: Mine is a Mac Pro Early 2008 <comment240045> I can confirm that this works with a Mac Pro Early 2008. After the modifications I was offered the option to create an install disk, and I was then able to use a normal USB disk as the destination. (Note: I also added the "MacPro3,1" identifier to the "32BitSupportedModels" array as well - not sure if that mattered; and the names have changed a little, e.g. from `PreUSBSupportedModels ` to `PreUSBBootSupportedModels` etc.) Unfortunately, though, the Mac Pro won't boot from a normal USB drive, either. So I guess I need to fix the DVD drive in the Mac before I can do this. <comment240047> I can confirm that my Mac Pro "Early 2008", which has the same issue not showing the "create an install disk" option, can boot from neither a USB flash drive nor from a regular USB drive. <comment240058> @iProgram Please use appropriate Markdown formatting rather than `br`s. <comment240059> @grgarside Hu? Where did I post/where is the post? <comment240062> @grgarside Ah, Sorry about that. Its because sometimes when you make 2 new lines the gap is too big, thats why I use `br`s <comment240063> @iProgram Use two spaces at the end of a line to create a line break in Markdown. <comment240113> @Thomas: If your DVD drive is not working, you can still install Windows 7 or 8.1 using the iso file. The instruction ars given [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179486/boot-camp-install-of-windows-7-issue-no-bootable-devices/180263#180263). If you are trying to install Windows 10, let me know and I will update the instructions. <comment256740> Note that in 10.11 you cannot edit Boot Camp Assistant in place, even as root. I made a copy of the app on my desktop and was able to preform this hack on the copy. <comment259193> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment273437> This worked perfectly for me
