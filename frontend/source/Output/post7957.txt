Editor or notes application with Markdown support? <body> Are there any editors or notes applications out there that support Markdown?   I am often having to make notes or documents where markdown formatting would be ideal, and have gotten into the habit of using markdown on a daily basis.  <answer7958> nvALT does the trick.  I prefer the plain Notational Velocity myself, but Markdown fans seem to really like the nvALT fork.  <answer7963> It's not a note taker emper se/em, but Textmate has a Markdown mode that will make it easier to use some of the syntax. Like bold, italic, list, etc.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KfbnE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer7964> Textmate has a markdown bundle which includes multimarkdown.  The bundle allows you to convert to PDF, HTML or to view the generated output on screen.  There are also tab-complete commands and a bunch of shortcuts.  <answer8110> If you want a Mac app that actually looks like a Mac app, supports Markdown out of the box (no plugins or add-ons required), and updates on a regular basis, you want BBEdit. I can't recommend it too highly.  <answer8826> emacs supports markdown if you like it, but I guess if you are not used to it, the learning curve is a bit steep.  <answer33977> Since you are using MacVim, you might want to try the vim-pandoc plugin, which supports highlighting, folding, snippets, and conversion (though that can also be done from the shell, even within vim, using things like markdown2pdf) to other formats.  <answer38450> Let's add another:   ul liSublime Text 2/li /ul  <answer128196> h2Mou/h2  Mou is my favourite Markdown editor for editing GitHub files and other documentation. Its live preview is priceless for editing in this way, especially using the specifically-designed GitHub theme that mimics the end result as shown on GitHub's preview and wiki pages.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0xUA1.png" title="Mou Example Document with GitHub CSS"  The app also lets you export to HTML along with the CSS so that you can upload the documentation outside of GitHub but retain the style.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oMMhb.png" width="426"  The app is one of a very few apps that even supports tables not in the core Markdown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b95N6.png"  Mou can be launched from the command line with a file using the standard OS X app launching method:  precodeopen -a Mou text.md /code/pre  <answer128222> I use Byword with pleasant results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4i6o.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer128264> Mashable has a quite comprehensive list: http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/. It is from June 2013, but if you combine it with something more recent like http://codegeekz.com/markdown-editors-and-tools/, you might find most of the general purpose markdown editors for the Mac.  <answer128278> I use iA Writer and I am very satisfied (iA Writer is available at the Mac AppStore)    img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/tcjtnrx98rc4o5y/writer-for-mac-5.png" alt=""br img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ttlhsxlk6zqrtlk/writer-for-mac-alice.jpg" alt=""  <answer128392> I used TextMate when I was co-writing a book using Markdown a few years ago. I still write a lot of Markdown, but now my tools of choice are:  ul liSublime Text/li liplus Markdown Editing plugin/li liplus OmniMarkupPreview/li /ul  One nice thing about Markdown is you don't get locked in to a specialized app like Microsoft Word just to write and read it.   What makes for a good toolchain in my experience is a solid text editor as the base, plus good live previewing and some custom coloring of the source. Sublime Text is an excellent text editor (available for Windows and Linux too) and those two (free) plugins trick it out for Markdown nicely.  <answer128585> On mac try Marked2 http://marked2app.com/  You can basically use the editor of your choice and it will display the markdown when you save the text.   Window can float above.   Good if you have enough screen realestate to keep your plain text and markdown preview visible at same time.  Written by Brett Terpstra who also did NVAlt.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcoep.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer128711> The original Markdown script by Gruber is part of BBEdit. BBEdit also has a life preview of Markdown documents.  If you want more than plain old Markdown, the best application is Multimarkdown composer by Fletcher Peny (the author of MultiMarkdown), or Marked 2 by Brett Terpstra (already mentioned above).  <answer190836> It's on old question with many answers, but Github now also has their own texteditor which supports Github flavoured markdown (and any other markdown you wish, by means of plugins/settings)!  Atom is highly customisable and by default lightweight, so for markdown I think it's absolutely awesome! https://atom.io  <answer209896> I have been impressed with letterspace  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0TVkE.png" alt="enter image description here"  It is available both on iOS and OS X, and syncs vi iCloud.  Notes are stored in plaintext for easy retrieval/backup/migration.  <answer237513> Go Edit for iOS allows you to write text in markdown strongor/strong rich text (HTML) and makes it easy for you to switch between the two. You can also embed photos into markdown documents from your photo library without needing to upload them into the web beforehand.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sqpsv.png" width="320" height="480" alt="Go Edit HTML Mode"  <answer237895> I use Ulysses on OS X and iOS. It syncs via iCloud and can export to ePub, PDF, text bundle, docx and plain text.   http://www.ulyssesapp.com  <comment8599> Nice. nvALT does seem to do it. Would be interested in others. <comment8606> I have been tempted by Textmate before, but will have to add it to my too buy list :( <comment8608> @diago Kod (http://kodapp.com) is a (free) Textmate 2 wannabe, it's still in early stages but developing very fast. The Markdown plugin for it shouldn't take very long, you could wait for that. <comment8609> Besides, I don't know what you're using right now as a text editor, but textmate might be the killer tool that will make you forget about all others. And still serve as a fast note taker (throw in some Dropbox and you can even sync it wherever you are). <comment8616> @Loic I use MacVIM for Text Editing. The idea of Markdown just came about because I would like preview capability, but then I haven't looked at a VIM plugin for it. <comment8617> @diago shouldn't be hard, gruber provide the perl script to transform markdown to HTML. Then again, I don't know how to create a vim plugin, but it should be easy for _someone_ :) <comment8624> @Diago  I believe Scrivener will also do it, but it may be overkill for what you're trying to do.  For a simple, fast, universally accessible note-taking utility, NV and its spawn are hard to beat. <comment8759> A bit pricey, but an option. nvAlt turned out to be exactly what I wanted, but it is good to know there are other options if I decide to do more then what it can offer. <comment9426> search for vim-markdown on github <comment150251> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment150528> Meanwhile, TextMate v2.0 is free. <comment150737> The linked Articles list and describe about 100 Markdown Tools. I do not see how summarizing or excerpting helps here. (Honestly. If you know what I could have excerpted or summarized here, let me know.) -- Thinking about it, I am not sure if the question is a "good" stackexchange question. Taken literally "yes, lots, lmgtfy is the answer". Taken less literally it's more like "please list all Markdown Tools, one par answer", which isn't really a question.
