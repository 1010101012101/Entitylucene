Macbook Air not booting - White Screen <body> Macbook Air is not booting.    When I turn it on I hear the chimes and then white screen. I've tried starting in Safe mode and when I click kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd P /kbd kbd R /kbd  I get an error 6003f or something like that.   When I click kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd  with power button and I select WiFi then it keeps searching for backups for ever and when I click Reinstall OS X then it doesn't show anything.  <comment314550> Please take a photo.
