Question Regarding Bootcamp and Windows 7 <body> I am possible going to install windows 7 on my iMac using the standard bootcamp setup and have a question about this setup.  I will store all of my large movies on the mac and will need good access to them, once windows 7 has been installed is it able to access HFS+ partitions at a reasonable speed and more importantly, will i be able to create an SMB share of the folders on the mac through windows?  Thanks for any feedback.  <answer49468> I recently installed Windows 7 using BootCamp on my MacBook Pro, Yes, I am able to access all the files on my mac HD.
