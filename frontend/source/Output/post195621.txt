Create directory inventory when ejecting <body> I use UnDock Now! to eject external hard drives, which allows running AppleScripts before ejecting. I would like to have a running inventory in a text file of all of the folders and filenames that exist on a given drive when ejecting...any thoughts on how to do this?  <comment233578> Well, either building the file with AppleScript or using AppleScript to launch some shell commands to do so might do the trick. What exactly are you looking for here? If you are looking for code samples, what have you tried so far? <comment233663> Any kind of code sample for how to get the file names from the external drive would be most helpful - I have found existing scripts online that will open a Numbers document and save it and/or export it as I need. <comment233751> Patrix - I just saw that you are the reason I have the script that I have, thank you!
