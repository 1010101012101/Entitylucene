iCloud drive and git repository <body> I have upgraded some of my Macs to Sierra. Now, I'm wondering whether I want to enable iCloud on the Document folder or not. It seems useful, if it works well. I'm syncing some of PDF files between iPad over iCloud and my expereince was "so-so" compared with Dropbox based sync (I'm using PDF expert on iPad).  I'm particulary intereded in how git repository work (or not work) well on  iCloud drive -- I have multiple Macc, I know iCloud drive is slow in sync.   Do you have any experience, or recommendation on this?
