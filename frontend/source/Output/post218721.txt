Should I expect restoring Yosemite from a Time Machine backup to take forever? <body> El Capitan was a disaster for Office Mac 2011, specifically Outlook. The recent Microsoft update resolved the problem with Outlook crashing, but it didn't fix the problem I had where email sent to me was disappearing into the ether.  After conversations with both Apple and Microsoft support, neither who had a resolution, the final advice was to restore to the previous OSX, Yosemite. I used Command +R to restore from a Time Machine image and after 6 hours with the startup bar stuck halfway, I stopped it and came back in to check the disk and it's OK. So I started the restore again, and it back at the same halfway point and has been there for 6 hours and counting. Should I ride it out? How long should this take? I'm running on a 2014 MacBook Pro. Any reassurance or advice is appreciated!  <answer218725> First things first, make sure you backup before all of this:  When you restore from a backup you are not restoring to a previous version of OS X, you'll need to backup, erase the disk, reinstall with Yosemite and apply your backup.
