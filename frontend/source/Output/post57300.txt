Hide App Name in Mac OS X Lion Dock <body> I am trying to figure out how can I disable/hide the App Name in MacOS X Lion dock. I've also attached an image so you can see what I mean.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXfha.png" alt="enter image description here"  Someone has any idea about how can I hide that?  <answer57301> ol liIf you have Dev Tools ol liGo to /Users/Your Name/Library/Preferences//li liOpen com.apple.dock.plist (It should open in Property List Editor)/li liIn the Editor disclose Root  persistent-apps  0  Tile Data/li liYou'll see the file-label for the first dock item.

You can edit the codecom.apple.dock.plist/code file that is stored in code/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Preferences/code to get rid of all names of empersistent/em applications (e.g. icons that stay in the dock even when you've quit out of them). In-depth instructions are here, on the apple developer website.  Note that I tried the "without dev tools" instructions at the above link and the code.plist/code file was full of non-human-readable encoded data, so you may have a harder time if you don't have the Property Editor or Xcode applications installed.  <comment65803> Both Dane Balia and myself have provided methods to opt out of app label names on a per-app basis <comment65804> Editing the Dock's preferences for your app only works if your app is pinned, and it's unreliable (the Dock's prefs schema might change at any point) and generally rude. Please don't do that in apps you distribute.
