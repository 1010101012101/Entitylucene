What is the modern way to do port-forwarding on El Capitan? (forward port 80 to 8080) <body> The old utility codeipfw/code was discouraged in recent versions of Mac OS X and is now gone from El Capitan.  What is the modern way to do port forwarding in El Capitan?   I simply want port 80 to forward to port 8080.  <answer230331> The modern way to forward ports in El Capitan is using codepf/code. In the example below all port 80 requests are forwarded to port 8080 on the same host. Please adjust the redirections to your needs.  ol liCreate an anchor file emorg.user.forwarding/em in /private/etc/pf.anchors   precodesudo touch /private/etc/pf.anchors/org.user.forwarding /code/pre  with the following content and a trailing empty line  precoderdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8080 rdr pass on en0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8080 rdr pass on en1 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8080 /code/pre  or  precoderdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8080 /code/pre/li liModify the file /private/etc/pf.conf but keep a trailing empty line  original file:  precodescrub-anchor "com.apple/*" nat-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "com.apple/*" dummynet-anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "com.apple/*" load anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple" /code/pre  to  precodescrub-anchor "com.apple/*" nat-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "org.user.forwarding" dummynet-anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "com.apple/*" load anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple" load anchor "org.user.forwarding" from "/etc/pf.anchors/org.user.forwarding" /code/pre/li liParse and test your anchor file to make sure there are no errors:  precodesudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.anchors/org.user.forwarding /code/pre/li liNow modify /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist from   precode&lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;pfctl&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-f&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/etc/pf.conf&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  to  precode&lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;pfctl&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-f&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/etc/pf.conf&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  You have to disable System Integrity Protection to accomplish this. After editing the file reenable SIP. After rebooting your Mac pf will be enabled (that's the -e option).  Alternatively you may create your own launch daemon similar to the answer here: Using Server 5.0.15 to share internet WITHOUT internet sharing./li /ol  After a system update or upgrade some of the original files above may have been replaced and you have to reapply all changes.  If you want to forward across different interfaces you have to enable this in /etc/sysctl.conf:  precodenet.inet.ip.forwarding=1 net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1 /code/pre  <answer248064> To forward all port 80 traffic to port 8080, you can enter the following from the Terminal command line.  precodeecho " rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8080 " | sudo pfctl -ef - /code/pre  Taken from https://salferrarello.com/mac-pfctl-port-forwarding/  <comment307870> Why isn't there a simple command to do this anymore? It's too complicated now. <comment310080> Worked perfectly! <comment315210> Worked great. Thanks a lot sir! <comment327629> @klanomath -- this works and i can forward port x to port y on 127.0.0.1 etc, but i am unable to forward ports to my windows vm running on paralles desktop, Any idea ? here's my question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40695684/osx-elcapitan-portforwarding-to-parallels-vm-using-pfctl <comment327636> Does not seem to work when forwarding port to a VM which is running on parallels desktop <comment338151> and from the mentioned article, to remove it, `sudo pfctl -F all -f /etc/pf.conf`, and to display your current port forwarding rules, `sudo pfctl -s nat` <comment345559> @sudhir You did not successfully link to your new Question. By default a Parallels VM is not visible to the network, as a security precaution. You can change a setting in the VMâ€™s configuration to make the VM visible. And remember, `ping` is your friend in diagnosing network problems. <comment360716> Please accept an answer. <comment360717> @suhir's question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/262708/os-x-el-capitan-port-forwarding-to-parallels-vm-using-pfctl <comment360728> @klanomath What is the "one command" we should "see below"? I do not follow. <comment360729> @BasilBourque When I wrote the comment, [Sal Ferrarello's answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/248064/93229) had less up-votes than mine ;-). It doesn't survive a restart though and you have to enter it again after a reboot... <comment360730> @klanomath Thanks. FYI, you can link to another Answer using the URL found in the "share" link on that Answer. Ex: See [the Answer by Sal Ferrarello](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/248064/17907) <comment360731> @BasilBourque I was in a hurry probably and just wrote a quick and dirty comment (without a proper link)...
