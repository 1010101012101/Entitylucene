How can I install all brew packages listed in a text file? <body> Does Homebrew offer anything similar to pip's codepip install -r requirements.txt/code feature? I have a new MacBook Pro arriving today, so one of the first tasks will be to migrate my brew installations. I've already performed a codebrew list &gt; brew.txt/code command. Will I be able to use this to install all the packages it lists in one command on the new machine?  <answer279078> You can do codebrew leaves &gt; my_brews.txt/code and then on the new machine do  codefor i in $(cat brew_leaves); do; brew install "$i"; done/code. You can use newlines where there are semicolons above. [assuming bash]  <answer280097> MERM provided a working answer, but others may be interested in a solution that, while not included with Homebrew, is published by the same people. Homebrew bundle is a brew package that is designed for this purpose, also handling casks and, I think, Mac App Store apps (with the mas package).  <answer280107> precodexargs brew install &lt; brew.txt /code/pre  No need to cat the file (see Useless Use of Cat Award) and xargs instead of a for loop to avoid IFS.  <comment351235> brew leaves will list only packages you added, not others brought in as dependancies. <comment352237> Would `brew install $(cat my_brews.txt)` not accomplish the same in one single invocation of `brew`, without the need of a `for` loop? <comment352239> I think the newlines in my_brews.txt would mess you up. Have you tried this? <comment352242> Yes, works either way for me. Bash scans the results of the `$(cat` â€¦ `)`parameter expansion and then [uses either of the space, newline, and tab characters to split words](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#Word-Splitting) as if they were all the same (unless you have set some weird value for `IFS`, in which case either approach would fail). <comment352274> Just an addition to this, you can use `brew bundle dump` to create a file of everything that you have installed currently, transfer the output file to another computer, and run `brew bundle` to install everything.
