Recording iPad and speech using Quicktime stops recording when screen is static <body> I'm trying to record a demo of using an app on my iPad, with me talking over the top of it.  I've hooked up my iPad Air 2 (iOS 8.3) to my Mac (10.10.3) using a lightning cable and am then using Quicktime to do a movie recording.  I update the video source to iPad and then press the red button to record   It begins recording ok, but if the screen stops changing or moving (e.g. when I switch to the login page and talk over this for a bit), it stops capturing anything for that period, even though I'm still talking and only restarts again when the screen moves significantly. I can see that this has happened as the filesize indicator on the recording overlay stops increasing.
