release stuck hover label <body> When I use for example a browser like Safari there are websites where you can go over an area with your mouse and a hover label appears.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HewV8.png" alt="Safari hover label"  When I switch to fast from safari into another application or desktop the hover label just stays at it's original positions until I find the exact tab with the website where this hover label has been used.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HEgZb.png" alt="Safari hover label stuck"  How do you remove this label without having to search for the tab with the exact website in it to remove the floating label?  NOTE: I just noticed when doing a google search (dynamic suggestions) the first time it did remove the hovering label. The second time it didn't. Could this have todo with javascript?
