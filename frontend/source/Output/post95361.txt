VNC Server for non-Jailbroken iPhone/iPad <body> I'm looking for a VNC server for my iPhone/iPad that (assuming I know the IP address) I can connect directly to using a VNC client. To summarize the features I'm looking for:  ul liNon-hosted, i.e. no software needed to be continuously running on a computer (rules out  Reflector or AirServer)/li liNon-Jailbroken device (rules out Veency)/li /ul  <answer95366> strongA VNC server on an un-jailbroken device is impossible due to Apple restrictions./strong Any such app would not be able to run in the background (without a jailbreak tweak to modify the backgrounding code) and is not permitted by App Store regulations anyway.  <answer96793> EggPlant (testing tool) can run a vnc server on iOS device without jail breaking, though I have no clues, how they do them. Thanks  <comment111916> I was afraid this might be the answer.
