Terminal not recognizing commands <body> My terminal is not recognizing the majority of commands. It won't recognize ls, ruby, python, brew, and a few others. Does anyone know how to fix this?   <answer222495> This sounds like an issue with your codePATH/code, run  precode/usr/bin/echo $PATH /code/pre  My guess is that is going to be missing the required directories  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin /code/pre  Then try again  The codePATH/code variable is the list of directories that will be searched when executed by the shell; this variable will not persist between bash sessions - and should be set in your code~/.bashrc/code file.  precodeecho "export PATH=$PATH:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc /code/pre  In your shell, embash/em, the code.bashrc/code file will automatically be sources on terminal creation.  <comment269649> What does the prompt look like? What is your $PATH? The more information you can provide, the easier it is for others to help you troubleshoot. Best wishes! <comment269938> My $PATH is â€™/usr/local/bin:??
