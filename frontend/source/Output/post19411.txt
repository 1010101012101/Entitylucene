How do I set up an IRC server on OS X for my local network? <body> Is there a nice way to set up an IRC server for my wireless home network, running on an old Mac Mini?  On other forums people have recommended compiling IRCD-Hybrid for OS X. I have Homebrew installed and it contains a formula for ngIRCd; would that work?  Or should I give up and just use the Bonjour functionality built into iChat?  <answer19420> There are a couple packages available via Mac Ports. If you haven't used macports it's just like YUM or apt-get on linux.  <answer62496> Since you have codeHomebrew/code installed, codengircd/code is very simple to install and configure.  Install ngIRCd  precode$ brew install ngircd /code/pre  Add /usr/local/sbin to your PATH  precode$ vi ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  edit the config file (very easy to follow, even for a beginner, as the defaults are just fine for everything.) strongNote/strong the path may be different for you to homebrew / ngircd version folders.  precode$ cd /usr/local/mxcl-homebrew-697d2ae/Cellar/ngircd/17.1/etc/ $ vi ngircd.conf /code/pre  Here's a sample config file, should you need it.  Verify your config, if you like:  precode$ ngircd --configtest /code/pre  Then simply start the server:  precode$ ngircd /code/pre  <comment196812> I should note that the default Cellar location is now /usr/local/Cellar
