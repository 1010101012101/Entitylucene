Unable to type the shortcut Command-Shift-B on Yosemite <body> On Yosemite (Mac OS X 10.10.4) I'm not able use the shortcut codeCommand/code-codeShift/code-codeB/code, while codeCommand/code-codeShift/code-code&lt;another-letter&gt;/code works as expected.  I've double checked this in the Keyboard Viewer: pressing codeShift/code, codeCommand/code and codeB/code simultaneously won't show the codeB/code button as pressed.  That is, this is what I see when pressing the 3 buttons:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5kEc.png" alt="enter image description here"  Same goes by pressing codeShift/code-codeCommand/code and then clicking the codeB/code in the Keyboard Viewer with the mouse pointer.  Is there any setting that might prevent the codeB/code from getting pressed?  <answer199983> I am unaware of a setting that would prevent the kbdB/kbd from being pressed when modified by kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdShift/kbd. Assuming that you are not running any third party applications that may be affecting/altering keyboard shortcuts, such as Keyboard Maestro, I suggest you try the following:  Delete (move to trash and empty trash) the file codecom.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/code from code/Users/YourName/Library/Preferences/code and restart.  <answer231457> If you have ClipMenu installed, the default key bind for the snippets menu is codeCMD+Shift+B/code.  To get this shortcut working in other programs, you'll need to either disable the shortcut or change it to another combination in ClipMenu Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CummG.png" alt="ClipMenu Preferences"  <comment240881> Which app is in the foreground? Finder? Are you using any bluetooth devices? If enabled shift-cmd-B means: send file to bluetooth device (like your keyboard or mouse ;-)) <comment240887> Thanks, I forgot to note I had removed the shortcut of the "Send File To Bluetooth Device" service in the keyboard preferences. The problem here is I'm not even able to type the `B` with those 2 keys though, independently from the app. <comment240894> Does this happen with all combinations of the left/right command and shift keys? <comment240899> Yes, with all combinations <comment240906> It would work depending what app is in front. For example open Firefox and use the shortcut and it will open the Bookmarks. In others which do not have it, it will sound a system alert. <comment240920> Thanks, I've tried but it doesn't work. <comment240921> On Firefox `cmd`-`shift`-`B` is *Show All Bookmarks* and it doesn't fire that command (`cmd`-`B` being *Show Bookmarks Sidebar*). In Atom `cmd`-`shift`-`B` should show the git status palette, but it won't. <comment282601> Are you using Clipmenu? By default it binds `cmd+shift+b` to snippets menu. I had disable it to get the shortcuts to work in other programs. <comment282629> @DerekKwok you're right! After disabling it, `cmd`-`shift`-`b` works now, thanks! If you want to add this as a "proper" answer I'll mark it as the solution.
