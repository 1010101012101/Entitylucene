10.12 Sierra Mail not rendering some emails correctly <body> I have Apple Mail and Airmail 3 running side by side. Emails from lists which used to be perfectly rendered are now rendered by Apple Mail as text, while still being correctly rendered by Airmail 3. What's up?  Example, rendered by Apple Mail:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u4BPK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And here's the same message rendered by Airmail 3:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQB81.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer255767> The fix for me, was surprisingly simple.  ol liSelect the relevant mail box./li liFrom the menubar, select "Mailbox" then choose "Rebuild"./li /ol  I have tried this menu item several times over the years when trying to address various issues with mail, always without success. On this occasion, with exactly the same symptoms you describe this fixed the issue.  Note: it may take several minutes to complete the Rebuildâ€¦ do not close Mail as this will interrupt the process.  Hope this helps.  <answer257006> This seems to be related to an image rendering bug in the new version of Apple Mail (Sierra).  When an &lt;img&gt; element in an HTML mail doesn't have both a "width" and a "height" attribute, the image is not displayed the first time the email is opened. If both attributes are defined, the image is properly displayed. If either one or both are missing, the image is not displayed.  The same &lt;img&gt; element is properly rendered in previous versions of Apple Mail.
