Restore Time Machine to a separate partition <body> I have partitioned my internal Hard Drive.  For testing purposes, I would like to MacOS (10.12 Sierra) onto the new partition and then to restore everything from my Time Machine backup into it.  I know I can do this if I reboot into the new partition, but is it possible to restore onto a separate drive or partition without rebooting?
