How to distort based on green screen movement in Final Cut Pro X <body> Hello I'm making a video in FCPX and I'm using a green screen the problem is that when the camera moves the green screen background is replaced with a image but that image doesn't react to the cameras movement so how can I ensure that the image replacing the green screen will transform and distort accordingly? Thank You!
