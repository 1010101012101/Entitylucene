Generating order summary from inventory in Numbers <body> I've created a stock list in Numbers for staff to input current stock levels. This is spread over 5 sheets.  I'm looking for the best way for Numbers to read all of this data and, when an item needs ordering, copy that item into a separate table that is broken down by Supplier.  So if we need to do our Tuesday order from Acme Frozen Foods, we can simply look at the generated ordering list that tells us what we need, rather than needing to scroll through all the items from the whole stock list checking one at a time â€“ Is something like this possible?  My original idea was to just mark those rows as red, but that still requires scrolling through all the spreadsheets noting them down. Is there a better way to centralise the flagged data?  <comment350022> Sounds like a good use case for Sort/Filter.  Would need a better understanding of your data.  Do you have a column for 'supplier'?  Min Stock level?  You could easily create filters based on criteria. <comment350241> Thanks for the reply. I started using Sort/Filter then found the feature doesn't work on an iPad so coded a web app to do it instead. Hopefully there will be feature parity soon, as it would've been easier! <comment350243> Glad you found a solution. Spreadsheets can be powerful, but when it comes to manipulating data, sometimes need a bit more. Cheers!
