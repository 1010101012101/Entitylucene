Is there software that provides a sound level meter? <body> I see that with iTunes v.12.6.1.25 I no longer have a drop-down menu item that I believe was called "Additions" so I no longer have access to an old plug-in called "SRS iWOW" which provided a very nice sound level meter I could place beneath the iTunes window. Is there software that provides a sound level meter? I have already tried Spectre (too complicated for me), NUGEN Audio Visualizer2 (I cannot open a sound file to analyze) , and free Orban Loudness Meter v.2.0.6 (corrupt). I don't expect the meter to be able to analyze the song currently playing in iTunes but I prefer that it did. Thank you.
