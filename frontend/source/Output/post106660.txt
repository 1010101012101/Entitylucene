How make Safari 7 open PDF files in Preview instead of opening them in-page? <body> Since Safari 7.0 which was introduced yesterday with OS X Mavericks the little terminal hack  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitOmitPDFSupport -bool YES /code/pre  doesn't work anymore (at least not for me).  Once you use the Terminal hack, the PDF is shown in binary/ascii-format in a new tab of Safari (like if you would open the file with TextEdit instead of an arbitrary PDF reader):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lodrb.png" alt="content of pdf in safari"  Any suggestions how to achieve the desired behavior anyway?  <answer107160> Just adding support to find an answer to this issue. I suppose in the meantime do this:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitOmitPDFSupport -bool NO /code/pre  <answer107278> Holding kbd‚å• alt/option/kbd down while clicking it makes it download it. That is with the old hack still marked codeYES/code. Not the best solution, but will do for the time being.  <answer108441> For Me this was not enough. I had do de following:  ol liType in Terminal.app:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitOmitPDFSupport -bool YES /code/pre  This disables pdf support in Safari./li liRestart Safari/li liType in Terminal app:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitOmitPDFSupport -bool NO /code/pre  This enables pdf support in Safari./li liRestart Safari and reload pdf page./li /ol
