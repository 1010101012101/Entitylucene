Is there a way to ask the Airport Extreme what it's external IP is via terminal? <body> Finally realized that my ISP was carriage natting me, and my router's ip is really on the ISPs network and not externally facing. =(  My ISP Is doing something that is thwarting my ability to get my Airpot Extremes IPv4 addresss. When I look at it via the airport utility, I clearly can the right address. However when I use something like strongcheckip.dyndns.org, icanhazip.com, http://www.whatsmyip.org,/strong it gives me the strongwrong IPv4/strong. Would like to use dyndns, and so far just entering in the ip manually.   strongIs there a way to just ask the Airport Extreme what it's external IP is via the terminal?/strong   So I am sure this question has been asked a lot, but I believe this is a slightly different question from the one below.    How to obtain the external IPv4 address via Terminal  SO Googling what's my ip, or any of those similar solutions is not going to work because my ISP is double batting me or something.   My airport is plugged directly into the ISP.

Straight into the modem, no other router between you &amp; them?  If so, then asking Google 'what's my IP address?' will show it.   That address is the 'border' between you &amp; the outside world &amp; in fact it kind of is partly at your Airport &amp; partly at the next hop, your ISP, insomuch as it's your last reference point, &amp; their first.br You'd need a hardware engineer to clarify that last point - the details are beyond me, I'm afraid.  <comment240112> My router is hooked directly into the wall, so yes last hop. It used to that what's my IP address would work. It now gives a device further down stream. <comment240114> For instance, my Airport Utility tells me my IPv4 address is *.*.16.34 and that is what I have my domain name set too and it works. However Googling 'what's my IP address' give me something quite different...for instance *.*.239.200. The two IPs are not the same device machine, as running a port scan on them shows different ports open. <comment240117> What makes you believe that the IP address returned by icanhazip.com etc is wrong? You can for instance run `traceroute cnn.com` to verify, the external IP address should correspond to line 2 (assuming your Mac is directly connected to the Airport Extreme). <comment240118> It's a different IP that my Airport Utility is saying, and when I do a port scan on it it does not have the same ports open. <comment240119> And your Airport Utility is correct because? <comment240120> I'm not even sure APU shows the external IP, can you add a screenshot? <comment240122> a router has an internal address, starting with 192.168. or 10. [private IP address ranges, repeated around the world in every home & business] of which your internal devices will be higher last digits of that network [192.168.0.26 for example] - & an external address, which could be anything except those numbers, a public-facing address, unique in the world - the device itself performs Network Address Translation [NAT] so one can talk to the other. <comment240123> Because I can hit my web server with it. Also the two IPs show completely different ports open. <comment240124> Based on current comments, I'm currently suspecting double NAT & that the 'plug in the wall' connects to another router before the ISP - which makes my answer so far 'half right' <comment240126> So the IPv4 that my Airport Utility is showing is right, and others way outside my ISP can hit it. The question is is there anyway to ask the router, what it's external IP. Certainly he Airport Utility is doing this. <comment240129> @TETSUJIN, can you update your answer to say you are likely being double natted, and there is no way to get an external IP. When I tried to hit the IPv4 that i thought was right on my iPhone, and not on my network it was unreachable. I am convinced your double natting is what is going on. Will give you the answer then. <comment240132> It looks like they are doing this to me... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT <comment240133> can you please add the output of `traceroute cnn.com` to your question and indicate which of the lines correspond to the two IP addresses you see? <comment240135> The reason I could hit my server, and my friends could as well is we have the same IP. Looks like I don't have an external IP. @patrix, please see the trace route above. <comment240217> On my phone today. Will flesh out later.
