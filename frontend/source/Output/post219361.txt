How does OS X detect a PowerPC application? <body> I use an application called Anki for learning foreign languages and professional terminology. This app creates a default folder in code/Users/user/Documents/Anki/code, which I did not want.  You can circumvent this by calling the app from the CLI with the code-b/code option. Because of that, I went into the app bundle and looked for executable in codeAnki.app/Contents/MacOs//code, which is simply called codeAnki/code.  I renamed this file to codeAnki2/code and made a new executable called codeAnki/code, which simply reads:  precode/Applications/Anki.app/Contents/MacOS/Anki2 -b /Users/henrikgiesel/Library/Application\ Support/Anki   /code/pre  And I can open the App bundle perfectly fine!... Until the next reboot, then it will complain:  emYou can’t open the application “Anki.app” because PowerPC applications are no longer supported./em  Why is this? How does OS X detect PowerPC application? Would it work if I wrote a C-file doing basically the same and putting the compiled version in the place of the Shell script?  strongEDIT:/strong  I can still open it from the CLI like this:  precode/Applications/Anki.app/Contents/MacOS/Anki /code/pre  But not like this  precodeopen /Applications/Anki.app /code/pre  <answer256878> Try wrapping the shell script as an app using Platypus. I've packaged multiple perl and bash scripts using the program, all appear as simple applications, with an icon of your choice, none have ever been misidentified as PPC apps.  <comment265315> The title of this question is misleading / not helpful, because obviously you’re not actually dealing with PowerPC code, OS X just misidentifies something. <comment265355> But the OS thinks it deals with PowerPC code, so it would be helpful to know, what causes this behavior. <comment265375> What version of OS X are you running? <comment265387> El Capitan 10.11.2
