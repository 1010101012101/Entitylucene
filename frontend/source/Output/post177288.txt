Is it possible to find out whether iPhone has MLC or TLC NAND by serial or batch number? <body> Is there any way to check whether the phone has MLC or TLC, just by serial number or batch number?  I will be buying iPhone 6, Space Grey, 64GB. From what I have read, 64GB version could be TLC or MLC.  <answer177366> You can't figure out the type of NAND from the serial number. However, Apple is dropping TLC NAND, so it most likely has MLC NAND (however, I can't tell you for sure without you buying it.)  <comment209657> Could you elaborate on how/why you think some phones have different NAND? Also - what's the end goal of your question. Would you upgrade to 128 or downgrade to 16 if that was how you got different NAND? <comment209671> https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do
