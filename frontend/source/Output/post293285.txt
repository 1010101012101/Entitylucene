Seagate NTFS "image not recognized" <body> Recently bought a seagate backup plus HDD, and cannot write via MBP. I can see it in disk utility and USB device tree. Under disk utility I can successfully use first aid but still cannot copy files to disk.   I have downloaded the paragon driver, but always shows not recognized, as attached. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKJIE.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any solutions?   I am using El Capitan, 10.11.6  <comment370028> Either clear your browser cache [or less disruptively, use another browser] & try the download again. Once a DL is cached badly, your browser is likely to DL the same bad copy every time. <comment370042> If your computer hasnâ€™t been rebooted in a while, force quit Finder and try again.
