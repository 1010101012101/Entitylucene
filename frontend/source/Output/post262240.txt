Apple-ID repair <body> I have a problem concerning my iPhone 5c. I want to sell this device to a friend, but I stumbled upon a problem. The iPhone belongs to my father, but because he passed away, the phone was no longer in use. And this is why i wanted to sell it, but when I tried to reset the iPhone, so I could sell it, I had to log into my fathers Apple-ID. I didn't know the password, and neither did anyone else in my family. I tried to change the password, but I couldn't. The Apple-ID was created on an old email adress, which no longer exists. So now I don't know what to do. I have no way of creating a new password, and I can't change the Apple-ID to a new email adress. I managed to reset the iPhone, but when I turned it back on it asked me to log into the Apple-ID of my father. I don't have a lot of experience in Apple products, so any help would be greatly appreciated! If you have any questions for me, I would be happy to answer them.
