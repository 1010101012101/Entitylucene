Excessive CPU usage from sysmond <body> Does anyone know what the codesysmond/code application does on OS X? Lately it has been taking about 25-30% cpu constantly for no apparent reason.  Things I've tried so far:  ul liReboot/li liSMC reset/li liPRAM reset/li liStarting up in safe mode (sysmond also sucks up resources there)/li liFilesystem check (except for the regular incorrect directory count, no errors or whatever)/li /ul  For the time being I've just disabled the sysmond plist but I guess it's not completely useless so I'm wondering what it's supposed to do and whether disabling is harmful ;)  <answer127663> This is what I found on my system     /usr/libexec/sysmond      /usr/share/man/man8/sysmond.8      /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.sysmond.plist   It is described as some sort of system/files monitoring.  DESCRIPTION        The  sysmon.conf  file is the main configuration file for the        sysmond(man) which monitors systems and services  on  various        machines connected to a network.  <answer127772> h1What sysmond does on OS X/h1  Watching the CPU usage of codesysmond/code through codeActivity Monitor/code is pointless! It turns out that codesysmond/code process is what codeActivity Monitor/code uses to get it's readings.  So if codesysmond/code is using lots of CPU, just kill activity monitor for it to stop.  h2Warning/h2  Increasing the update interval for codeActivity Monitor/code dramatically increases the CPU load, that's why I initially never noticed it and see it a lot more right now.  <answer277994> SYSMOND = System Monitor Daemon - monitors all system activity in background and automated by LaunchD (Launcher Daemon)  <comment149691> I've seen the man page, but it doesn't help much. Pretty much no description of what it actually does. <comment347046> Is this just speculation? Seeing higher CPU usage with Activity Monitor doesn't mean that's what it's supposed to do. <comment347094> Unfortunately there appears to be virtually no official documentation but it appears the only logical conclusion. Even the sysmond man page says nothing beyond "system monitor daemon" which makes sense.  So yes, it is speculation but is repeatable on all OS X systems I have encountered so far which makes it likely to be true. <comment348924> When I quit the Activity Monitor, then start it up again, the `sysmond` process's CPU Time has not changed. Which suggests that quitting the Activity Monitor does not end the `sysmond` process. <comment348945> But it does suggest that the process does nothing if the activity monitor is not running. Since it has to run as root this is probably easier than starting and stopping the process. <comment349838> This question already has an accepted answer and it looks just like the answer provided on April 15, 2014. <comment349873> I double checked my Activity Monitor settings, and somehow the Update Frequency had gotten set to 'Very Often (1 sec)'. Not sure how this happened, but after setting it to 'Normally (5 sec)' the CPU usage of `sysmond` immediately dropped from ~25% to ~5%. <comment354051> It turns out that even if you have Activity Monitor *running* (with no windows open), sysmond keeps running in the background. That means you should always *quit* Activity Monitor if you don't want to monitor anything anymore, instead of just closing all of its windows.
