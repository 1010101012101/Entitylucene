Is it possible to take a screenshot in Recovery Mode? <body> Or, anywhere outside "userspace?" For example, the login screen, or in Single User Mode.   <answer131669> Where OS X is booted but you can't take a screenshot because you're not logged in (e.g. the login screen, lock screen) you can take a screenshot over SSH. Connect over SSH to your Mac and runâ€¦  precodesudo screencapture /path/to/screenshot.png /code/pre  Where OS X isn't displaying a GUI (e.g. single user mode, boot sequence), you can't take a screenshot. This doesn't apply to virtual machines though, if you're determined to get a screenshot.  <answer210583> You most definitely can do a screen capture from Recovery.  ol liBoot into Recovery/li liOpen the Terminal from the Utilities menu/li liIn Terminal type:   precode/Volumes/name_of_HD/usr/sbin/screencapture -s /Volumes/name_of_HD/Users/name_of_user/Desktop/name_for_file.png /code/pre/li /ol  You will get crosshairs so you can select what you want a screenshot of (like CMD-Shift-4)  name_of_HD=whatever the name of the HD isbr name_of_user=any user on the systembr name_for_file.png=whatever you want to name the file    When you login as that user, the screen capture will be waiting on your Desktop.  <comment254189> This use of Terminal automatically mounts the filesystem as read/write which prevents the saving of files using the default keys. <comment254190> In Recovery, the filesystems are mounted read only, which makes the key shortcuts not work. See the Terminal utility to mount a writeable filesystem and [save the pictures from the command line](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/210583/5472). <comment336693> Under macOS Sierra, it seems that all you can screenshot is the contents of the Terminal window.  There does not appear to be a way to interact with the interface whilst the screenshot crosshairs are present nor does multitasking appear to be possible whilst booted to the Recovery System. <comment365108> You can't leave the terminal window, to screenshot anything else tho.
