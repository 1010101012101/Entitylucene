How to get a universal binary with both architectures from Homebrew on Mavericks <body> I need to install Cairo for the use of a 32-bit application on Mavericks.  After first uninstalling libpng, I have succeeded in forcing a complete recompile of Cairo and all its dependents (libpng, fontconfig, pixman, glib) using  precodebrew install --build-from-source cairo /code/pre  Showing the codebrew info/code on these libraries indicates they were built from source, and built as a universal binary.  However codelipo -info/code reports the architecture only as x86_64.  How can I get Homebrew to install Cairo and all its dependents with both i386 and x86_64 architectures?  Thanks for the help.
