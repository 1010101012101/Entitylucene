Can a Parallels VM be salvaged from a recovered .hds file (200gb file)? <body> The computer got hosed &amp; we lost the code.pvm/code file, then the Time Machine Backup drive was involved in a car crash! I know the code.pvm/code file is a package with multiple files inside, but I've looked thru the recovered data &amp; can't find a code.pvm/code file.  I see multiple code.hds/code files, but no code.pvm/code file.  I am using Parallels 7 &amp; trying to re-create the code.pvm/code file on an external drive but am not having much luck. Changed the name of the file to code**.hdd/code, attached with Parallels, but the VM complains that the Hard Drive is not there.  Possibly I am not understanding the basic contents needed for a viable code.pvm/code package?  Is what I'm trying to do even possible?  The original problem with the Time Machine drive was "stiction", they put the drive into a  clean room to fix that, and as they were reading the data from the drive one of the heads failed.  Needless to say, the data recovery took 2 weeks, but I think we finally have all the data (in the form of raw files) from the Time Machine Backup drive now.  <answer177945> It's possible that just the partition table got trashed somehow, use TestDisk to re-write the partition table:     strongTestDisk/strong is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.   Attach the virtual drive to another VM and use TestDisk from there.
