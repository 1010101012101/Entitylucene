How can you do compound boolean statements in AppleScript? <body> For example  precode    on run {input, parameters}      set Variable1 to "5"      if (Variable1 is not "5") &amp; (Variable1 is not "6") then          display dialog "Variable1 is not 5 or 6"      else          display dialog "Variable1 is 5"      end if       return input end run /code/pre  When running this program, I get the error:     Canâ€™t make {false, true} into type boolean.   <answer261509> The following should handle the test:  precodeset Variable1 to "5"  if (Variable1 is not "5") and (Variable1 is not "6") then     display dialog "Variable1 is not 5 or 6" else     display dialog "Variable1 is " &amp; Variable1 end if /code/pre  <comment327451> Just to be clear, which part of my code was incorrect: the use of the ampersand instead of "and", the parentheses, or the use of "is not" instead of "is not equal to"? <comment327452> There can be more then one way to write something, sometimes it just comes down to style but the primary error was the use of the ampersand. If you just change it to `and` the code should run although if you `set Variable1 to "6"` it's going to erroneously say `display dialog "Variable1 is 5"`, <comment327453> But what do you mean by "primary error"? Isn't the ampersand the only error? <comment327454> No the ampersand was not the only error. IMO `display dialog "Variable1 is 5"` was wrong as you're testing a _variable_ and if it was set to `6` the message should say `Variable1 is 6` not `Variable1 is 5` so I updated my answer to reflect the two changes I'd make to your _code_.
