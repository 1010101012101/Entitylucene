OSX Removing file under a ".vol" <body> I have a file I want to remove that's stored inside a "strong.vol/strong"   precode501   9984 Corel Painter 1  16 /.vol/16777218/29979256/nTitles Product Licenses IV  /code/pre  I received this by running  precodesudo opensnoop -n Corel Painter 12 /code/pre  Specifically I want to remove the strongnTitles Product Licenses IV/strong file, I have been pulling my hair out trying to get at this file to no avail. A nudge in the right direction will be greatly appreciated, a direct answer would be even better!  Thanks for taking the time.  <comment99130> Does this have to be via Terminal? However you do so, can't you view invisible files and delete it? I would use one of the little utilities to show invisibles, change permissions temporarily with BatChmod, and trash the file ... but I don't use the command line much. <comment99131> I'd rather avoid third-party stuff. I have tried various apps already and none seem to do the trick so I turned to Terminal. It's a specific question and Google yields no results. The ".vol" is just a pseudo-directory, using those crazy digits you see following it work as an ID for it. <comment99339> Your choice, of course--just saying, you can get at *any* file or directory, pseudo or not, and modify or delete it via these tools or their equivalent terminal commands.
