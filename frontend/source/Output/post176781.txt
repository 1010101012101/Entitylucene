Broken $PATH variable <body> I was trying to add something to my $PATH variable, but I think I made some sort of typo.   Now, I am trying to fix this, I want to remove what I added, but when I type e.g. codeopen .profile/code, it tells me code-bash: open: command not found/code  How can I fix this?  <answer176783> Just use the full path to open:  precode/usr/bin/open .profile /code/pre  Once you've fixed your path, your shell will be functional again.
