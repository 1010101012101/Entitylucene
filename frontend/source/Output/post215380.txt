Stop AVG from scanning all app store downloads <body> I have AVG Free running on OS X 10.11 and what I'd like to know is how I can prevent it from automatically scanning some/all App Store downloads. For example, whenever I update Xcode, which is a massive download, the programs initiates a scan, which on my admittedly dated system, takes over an hour and bog down my CPU.  <comment260168> Why do you need antivirus? I admit the Xcode download is huge. <comment260179> This would be useful to know for people that insist on scanning files after they exist on the computer. Basically, how would you set AVG to scan the latest time machine backup periodically rather than always trying to scan things the moment they arrive.
