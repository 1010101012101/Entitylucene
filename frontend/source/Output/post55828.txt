There is a menu choice in iTunes that will convert to iPhone-compatible format.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7GE2n.jpg" alt="MENU"  <answer55832> have you tried re-encoding the file with Handbrake or another encoder? The file container may appear compatible, but that's not always the case. Re-encoding should confirm it, plus you can choose iPhone specific compatibility.  <comment64066> Have you checked inside the "Videos" app? If it's a video podcast it should show up there. Inconsistent, I know.
