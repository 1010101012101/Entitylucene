Is it possible to use MacBook as a display for Mac Pro? <body> I want to use a Mac Pro on the display of a MacBook. That's because I mainly use MacBook and now would like to use Mac Pro only when I need more power.  But since I'm a traveler for all year round, there is no choice to use iMac or MacBook Pro.  So is it possible to use the display, keyboard, and trackpad of a MacBook to use Mac Pro?   <answer283975> You can use some computers that have a Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt port as an external display.  You can view the contents of your Mac on the display of another Mac using Target Display Mode, a feature in OS X. Target Display Mode lets you use a Mac as the external display for another “primary” Mac. In some cases, you can also use Target Display Mode to play the sound from your primary Mac on the speakers of the external Mac. For example, a MacBook Pro could use a 27-inch iMac as the display and play its audio on the iMac as well.  After connecting the computers and turning on Target Display Mode, the external display Mac acts like any other external display. Apps that were open on the external display Mac remain open even though you can’t see their windows.  strongDisplay the contents of your Mac on an iMac with Thunderbolt/strong  If you have an iMac with Thunderbolt, any other Mac with Thunderbolt can use it as a display.

If the primary Mac has a Mini DisplayPort, the iMac may be able to play its audio. To see if it can, go to the primary Mac, choose Apple menu  About This Mac, click System Report, then select Audio in the Hardware category. A list of your computer’s audio devices appears. If HDMI Output or HDMI/DisplayPort output is listed, your computer’s Mini DisplayPort can send audio.
