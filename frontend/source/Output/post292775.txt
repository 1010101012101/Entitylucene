Cannot exit fullscreen and cannot interact with fullscreen applications <body> macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F2073)  On my Mac whenever any application (chrome, spotify, slack, etc...) enters full screen mode I cannot exit or interact with the application in any way.  ul likbdoption/kbd+kbdF11/kbd does not result in any change/li likbdoption/kbd+kbdF10/kbd does not result in any change/li likbdoption/kbd+kbdF9/kbd does not result in any change/li likbdoption/kbd+kbdF8/kbd does not result in any change/li likbdcommand/kbd+kbdF/kbd does not result in any change/li likbdcommand/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdF/kbd does not result in any change/li likbdcommand/kbd+kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF/kbd does not result in any change/li liMousing to the very top of the entire monitor reveals a menu bar which does not respond to being clicked/li liWindow control buttons (red, yellow, green - top left corner of the window) do not respond to being clicked./li likbdcommand/kbd+kbdW/kbd does not result in the window closing/li liIf an application supports multiple windows (eg: chrome may have multiple windows with tabs inside of them), I can move the window around but I cannot interact with anything regarding the application (all of the above also applies to this sort of window)./li /ul  I can only close the application via things like codepkill -9 '&lt;process-name&gt;'/code at the command line.  strongMy question:-/strong How can I troubleshoot this further as I'd love to be able to use full screen mode.  <answer293114> Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience.  The first thing I would do is to test whether this behaviour is replicated in Safe Mode.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. is the issue still present, etc)/li liNow exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li liOnce logged in again, test to see whether the behaviour continues/li /ol  When you're finished let me know how you went and we'll go from there.  hr  If you find that you don't have the problem in Safe Mode, but still do after logging in normally again, then it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions  strongInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions/strong  Let's start with Login Items:  ol liStartup normally/li liGo to System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/li liSelect the Login Items tab/li liTake a note of your Login Items /li liNow remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the kbd-/kbd button below/li liRestart your computer/li /ol  Now your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test this and see if the problem persists:   ul liIf the problem goes away you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved./li liIf the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:/li /ul  strongFonts:-/strong You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.  strongKernel Extensions:-/strong You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:  codekextstat | grep -v com.apple/code  The above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of strong3rd party kernel extensions/strong and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.  <comment369788> Ctrl-h do anything? (Longshot and not sure that's a long term solution, but maybe?) <comment369808> What happens if you press the ESC key? <comment370388> Nothing happens for either of those combinations. <comment370445> @Incognito Okay, good to know. Have you had a chance to test your Mac in Safe Mode?
