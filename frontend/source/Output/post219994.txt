Install El Capitan OS on a new SSD without USB driver <body> I have a hard disk and I would like to install an SSD on my MacBook. However I don't have any USB driver for installing El Capitan OS.  Is it possible to install the SSD and then install El Capitan OS when I use it for the first time? (install after first turning on the computer)  <answer220003> No, you need disk or USB stick to install it.  Why can't you use a USB stick? If that's because you can't buy it from Apple Store, you could use any 8GB+ stick to install drive.  It's very simple, you only need an codeInstall OSX *version*.app/code file and a USB stick.  h2Prepare stick/h2  ol liPlug it into your MacBook/li liOpen Disk Utility (Launchpad - Other)/li liChoose your stick in left hand side (It should be under codeExternal/code label)/li liClick on Erase button at top/li liChoose codeGUID Partition Map/code under codeScheme/code, codeOS X Extended (Journaled)/code under codeFormat/code, and name it codeOSXInstall/code (You can give it any name, but you'll need to change terminal commands too)/li liClick on Erase  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qU6hG.png" alt="Disk Utility"/li /ol  h2Get OSX Installer App/h2  For El Capitan open this link, and download it (You may need to click on codeView in Mac App Store/code   You strongdo not/strong need to stronginstall/strong it, just download.   h2Create bootable installer/h2  ol liBe sure to check that stick is plugged in and shows up in Finder./li liIf you have no password, set it temporarily /li liOpen Terminal app (Launchpad - Other)/li liCopy and paste this text into Terminal and hit kbdReturn/kbd:   precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/OSXInstall --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app --nointeraction /code/pre/li liType you password (It would be hidden, and cursor would not move)/li liNow just wait till it says codeDone./code/li /ol  h2Installation/h2  To boot from the installer stick, hold down the kbdOption/kbd key during Mac system start, and select it from the startup volume menu.  <comment331428> Or use disk maker X. It's automated.
