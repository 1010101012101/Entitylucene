The Command to enter login items is not working in 10.8 <body> I am entering the login item from the terminal but, this command is not working for me:  precodedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/loginwindow AutoLaunchedApplicationDictionary -array-add '{Path="/Applications/Your Application.app";}' /code/pre  What am I doing wrong?  <answer83016> I didn't have AutoLaunchedApplicationDictionary in code~/Library/Preferences/loginwindow.plist/code but only in code/Library/Preferences/loginwindow.plist/code.  Most login items are stored in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist/code. The paths are stored as alias data, but you can also add login items with AppleScript:  codeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to make new login item at end with properties {path:"/Applications/TextEdit.app", name:"TextEdit", hidden:true}'/code
