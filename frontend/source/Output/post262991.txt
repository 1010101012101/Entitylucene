How to save on iCloud a WhatsApp call record? <body> I was wondering if it was possible to save on iCloud a WhatsApp call record.  I have an iPhone 6s.  <comment343003> as Apple is saving the phone call record in iCloud, I would expect that there is a way to do so. To drive your question home: are you asking for the call history or the actual record of a call or several calls? Also, please provide iOS version and Whatsapp version
