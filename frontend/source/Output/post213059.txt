wired apple Keyboard isn't recognised when mac is connected to external display <body> My new MacBook Pro (2015) doesn't recognise the apple usb keyboard, when I connect it to an external display. The keyboard strongis/strong detected, if there no display connected. It doesn't make a difference wether the display connected via HDMI or over an MDP to VGA adapter. Any help would be appreciated. (english isn't my native language, so I excuse for any errors)
