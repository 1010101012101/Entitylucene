Possible to change Quick-Reply buttons in Mail Notifications? <body> Yosemite introduced a new feature to quick reply within a notification.  Mail offers the options to trash a new E-Mail or reply to it. strongBut, instead of trash, I want to archive it./strong   Can I change somewhere the buttons/behaviour within notifications?  <answer164831> It looks like it is impossible for now, but will hopefully be in next year's release. All that I've seen that you can do to is to style notifications by changing button names and menu title and with Mjolnir. Beyond that isn't built in to the API yet.  Similar question here  <comment193280> I wonder if it would be possible to examine the source for iMessage and Mail to recreate the interaction?
