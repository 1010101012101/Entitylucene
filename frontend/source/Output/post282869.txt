Can macOS be prevented from pausing certain apps when the system is out of application memory? <body> OS: mac OS Sierra 10.12.4  I run several distributed computing projects in BOINC Manager at times when I'm not using my Mac. All too frequently, a Force Quit dialog box appears with the message 'Your system has run out of application memory'. BOINC and any other open apps except the Finder are paused, so fewer or no BOINC tasks get done.   One workaround is to reduce the amount of memory that BOINC Manager can use, but it would be really be preferable simply to prevent the system from suspending BOINC. The projects benefit all mankind so I'd like to allocate as much RAM as possible to them.
