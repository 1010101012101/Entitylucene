Can i make my iPad stop autocapitalizing the word "i"? <body> If you look at my profile, you can see that i ask people not to capitalize the word "i" in the middle of a sentence. Now, ignoring whether or not this is a good idea, can i make my iPad not autocorrect a lowercase codei/code to a capital one?  <answer148029> There's not a fix I know of, but there's a workaround.  Prefs  General  Keyboards  Shortcuts.  Hit the + &amp; addbr Phrase i Shortcut ii  It won't accept anything less than a 2-character shortcut, but I'm sure it will take no time at all to remember to type ii for i.  em[now to stop mine doing it... grrr]/em   <answer150967> It turns out that by writing "i" enough times, the iPad eventually caught on and lets me write the way i want to. I just have to tap the code"i"/code in the keyboard suggestions for a few times, and it seemed to add it to the dictionary.  In fact, while writing this post, i accidentally hit kbdj/kbd instead of kbdi/kbd and it autocorrected to "i" for me.  <answer251255> Adding to the accepted answer, I have done this before, and I wrongly thought that just after so and so many times of deleting the capital I and re-typing small i it will catch on. However, the trick is to do it 10-20 times right after each other in the same text field, then capital I is gone.
