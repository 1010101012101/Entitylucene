MacBook Pro OS X and Windows Crash <body> I have a Mac-Book Pro on which i have windows 7 installed on Bootcamp partition, yesterday while working it suddenly crashed, I saw a blue screen for less than half a second and the system restarted and went on to boot windows again and it crashed again.   So i tried booting it to OS X, it booted but i couldn't see anything except for a black screen with a cursor. I searched for solutions to the black screen problem and tried some but none on them worked. So i shut it down to look for the problem in morning.   Now in morning it started misbehaving more, sometimes it would not show codestartup Manager/code even when codeOption/code key was pressed and would randomly boot into Windows or OS X. I tried booting in windows in safe mode but it would still crash  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ribpx.jpg" alt="crash"  And OS X also started crashing   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UHtPz.jpg" alt="OS X Crash"  I tried running First Aid in Disk Utility in Recovery Mode (which opened sometimes only, sometimes Mac would ignore CMD+R and go on to boot os of its choice). When i ran First Aid it said  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QjfkR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I also ran Windows repair and it said   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8VXUp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now i can't understand what the Problem is with my System ?  strongALSO/strong A month earlier my hard drive cable had failed and got it replaced. I had updated OS X El Capitan to OSX Sierra. And i don't think there is a problem with my hard drive becasue i was able to see my windows data while exporting registery data in windows repair .  <answer266699> There was a problem with my Hard drive cable, got it replaced.
