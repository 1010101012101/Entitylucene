Which MacBook models support (directly or indirectly) dual DVI monitors, for a total of three screens? <body> I've read through the "Questions with similar titles", and I don't see anything that directly answers my question.  Which current MacBook models (of any product line) support (directly or indirectly) attaching dual DVI monitors, for a total of three screens?  The monitors are third-party (Acer). By "directly or indirectly", I'm acknowledging that I'll likely have to buy additional cables.  <answer21274> You only have two options, and they're both supported by all current MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models:  ol liUse a DVI splitter to spread a single DVI output across multiple monitors (which will look like a single external monitor to the OS). The maximum resolution for an external monitor on all MacBook Pro or Air models is 2560 x 1600, so your maximum for the split displays will be 1280 x 1600 each (or maybe 2560 x 800)./li liUse a USB graphics adaptor for the third monitor, which will thus not have hardware graphic acceleration./li /ol  <answer21275> Any current MacBook Air or MacBook Pro will work. The first DVI monitor is simple; just get a Mini-Display Port to DVI cable. The second one  will require a USB to DVI adapter, like the IOGEAR USB 2.0 External DVI Video Card. The combination of these will allow you to use the two Acer monitors via DVI and the internal MacBook screen.  <answer21358> As per Mike Scott's answer (specifically, point 2), an example of a USB graphics adaptor can be found here.  <comment23292> Does Thunderbolt not allow you to daisy-chain displays? <comment23293> As far as I know, you can daisy-chain up to seven Thunderbolt *devices*, but only one of them can be a display. <comment23401> @mike - not true. Thunderbolt displays can be daisy chain-able, as long as both the video card and the Thunderbolt controller support it. Apple's forthcoming Thunderbolt Display is daisy chain-able on 2011 MBPs, but not MBAs, which have a less capable Thunderbolt controller. <comment26408> Have you had any experience with that IOGear USB to DVI device? <comment43163> @MikeScott - any example of such a DVI splitter? <comment43179> @Vlad â€“ I've not used any, but you can find plenty by Googling for "DVI splitter".
