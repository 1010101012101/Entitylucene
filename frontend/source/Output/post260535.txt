How do i delete an itunes update from the mac app store? <body> I installed iTunes 12.5.3, but the update is still in the App Store. I tried redownloading it, but it just doesn't work. It says updating and starts downloading but halfway through, it stops downloading and says update again. It also starts trying to download automatically which is very annoying because it doesn't work. can somebody please help?  <comment326230> Try downloading iTunes from http://www.apple.com/cn/itunes/download/ and remove current iTunes then install the downloaded package.
