Create a new (.txt) File in Finder - Keyboard Shortcut <body> I wanted to know if there is way to set keyboard shortcuts to make new files in Finder. For example, by default, you can create a new folder using kbdCMD/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdN/kbd. Is there a keyboard shortcut to create a new text file? I'm a programmer so this would be extremely useful  I would also be interested in creating other file type using keyboard shortcuts.   I have attempted to use automator but I'm finding it quite confusing and I'm not sure how I would connect a keyboard shortcut to it.  <answer129702> Well, here you go with an AppleScript for that.  strongFirst, create the AppleScript:/strong  ol liOpen Automator/li liCreate a emService/em/li liSet the input to emno input/em/li liDrag and Drop the emRun AppleScript/em workflow element onto the grey space./li liPaste the code from below into the AppleScript/li liSave the workflow as emCreate new file/em/li /ol  hr  precodetry   tell application "Finder" to set the this_folder ¬    to (folder of the front window) as alias on error -- no open folder windows   set the this_folder to path to desktop folder as alias end try  set thefilename to text returned of (display dialog ¬  "Create file named:" default answer "filename.txt") set thefullpath to POSIX path of this_folder &amp; thefilename do shell script "touch \"" &amp; thefullpath &amp; "\"" /code/pre  hr  strongTo add it as a shortcut:/strong  Go to Settings - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Services, Assign a Shortcut to it.  <answer129705> You can create an Automator Service yourself — it is rather simple to do. Then you can assign a keyboard shortcut to it so that you don't need to activate the service through the services menu (which you can do anyway).  Open Automator and select Service as the type of new document.  Set the service to receive no input in Finder.app and add the New TextEdit Document action to the workflow.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rStWx.png" alt="Workflow"  Save the service, then open System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services where you will find the service listed under General with the name that you gave for the service when you saved it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zM5lL.png" alt="Services"  Add a keyboard shortcut to the service by selecting the service then clicking 'add shortcut'.  Here you might have some problems if the shortcut is used already. So get creative to make one that works for you.  <answer129717> open terminal and type  precodetouch filename /code/pre  or   precode&gt; filename /code/pre  <answer129875> This is a repost of a post that I made last year.  I have had good experience with the following.  There are two useful utilities that you can download and install that will enable you to create a new text file (or RTF file) in a currently-open folder that you are viewing using the Finder.  The utilities are called NewTextFileHere and NewRTFHere and can be downloaded from  http://mac.softpedia.com/developer/Jonas-Wisser-37498.html  Icons for either of these apps can then be included on all of your Finder windows.  <answer129886> Just what I'd been looking for, Richard Fuhr. Thanks for this.   One note: that URL's link for the NewTextFileHere seems to load to an empty page. But I did a search and found the app here:  http://mac.softpedia.com/progDownload/NewTextFileHere-Download-70374.html  <answer129948> You could also assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "Finder"     set selection to make new file at (get insertion location) end tell /code/pre  The insertion location is either the target of the frontmost Finder window or the desktop.  <answer183269> I've created an AppleScript very similar to the @YoshiBotX's one, but with some improvements.  The idea is to create an Automator workflow and assigning a shortcut to it using the following steps:  ul liOpen strongAutomator/strong and create a strongService/strong;/li liSet the input to strongno input/strong, and the application to strongFinder.app/strong;/li liDrag and Drop the strongRun AppleScript/strong workflow element onto the grey space;/li liPut the contents of this AppleScript in the textbox;/li liSave the workflow with a reasonable name (like strongNew File/strong);/li liGo to strongSettings - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Services/strong and assign a shortcut to it./li /ul  Now, let's show the AppleScript:  precodeset file_name to "untitled" set file_ext to ".txt" set is_desktop to false  -- get folder path and if we are in desktop (no folder opened) try     tell application "Finder"         set this_folder to (folder of the front Finder window) as alias     end tell on error     -- no open folder windows     set this_folder to path to desktop folder as alias     set is_desktop to true end try  -- get the new file name (do not override an already existing file) tell application "System Events"     set file_list to get the name of every disk item of this_folder end tell set new_file to file_name &amp; file_ext set x to 1 repeat     if new_file is in file_list then         set new_file to file_name &amp; " " &amp; x &amp; file_ext         set x to x + 1     else         exit repeat     end if end repeat  -- create and select the new file tell application "Finder"      activate     set the_file to make new file at folder this_folder with properties {name:new_file}     if is_desktop is false then         reveal the_file     else         select window of desktop         set selection to the_file         delay 0.1     end if end tell  -- press enter (rename) tell application "System Events"     tell process "Finder"         keystroke return     end tell end tell /code/pre  For convenience, I'm putting this AppleScript in this GitHub Gist.   <answer260944> An alternative, if you already have BetterTouchTools (it used to be a free app, now it has a pay-what-you-want model with a 30 day trial period), you can find the action on code"Utility Actions &gt; Create New File in Current Folder"/code which does exactly this, with a pop-up to let you pick the name. Assign the shortcut you want (I picked Option+Shift+N) and you're good to go.  <answer270142> In case you are using MacVim there is an option under codeFinder -&gt; Services/code to create a new vim buffer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LzEee.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have mapped this to the short cut kbdShift/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdM/kbd in codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Shortcuts/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oFnEm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment151796> I don't understand how to set at shortcut to this specific script through the services tab <comment151797> I added a more detailed way on how to add this script as a shortcut. <comment151799> Now it should work with empty folders also. At least it works for me. You can write your template file inside the script "filename.txt". <comment151820> you lost me here? what does that do? <comment151821> Could you expand on how you would add a keyboard shortcut to this command? (@Buscar See [touch](http://www.linfo.org/touch.html)) <comment151885> well if you have PathFinder - that is really a great option ;D <comment186925> See also http://superuser.com/questions/106943/os-x-snow-leopard-finder-automator-item-for-creating-a-new-text-file <comment207223> This works pretty nicely with cmd2shell. No shortcut, but just click the cmd2shell button in finder and type the touch command. <comment219636> Why don't they have something like that by default? What is the matter with them? <comment220189> I was looking for something more compatible with the Finder in OSX. <comment271146> Your code is so simple and useful! I use the Automator to create a Application, which there is only one action: Run AppleScript with your code. Then I put this Application into the Finder Titlebar. That's OK. when I need, just click, and a new file will be create in current folder. <comment305996> Excellent script, thank you. The only thing I'd add to this write-up to make it more complete is info instructing newer Automator users that the workflow script they create should be saved in `~/Library/Services`. (My default was in `iCloud Drive\Automator` and it took me a little research to figure out where to save it so it would appear in under Services in Keyboard Shortcuts.)
