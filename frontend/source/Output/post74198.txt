Change Default Artwork in iTunes 11 <body> How do I change the default artwork for an artist in iTunes 11?  <answer74919> They seem to have found a fix, but for Windows. I haven't found a similar one for Mac, I'll update this answer if I find it.  Note: The above only applies to changing the default artwork for viewing by stronggenre/strong, not by strongartist/strong, which is still the unanswered question.  While it is possible to change this by playing with ratings, there doesn't seem to be a manual workaround, as existed in 10.7.  <comment86226> What do you mean with "default artwork for an artist"? Artwork is defined by album usually (or by track). <comment86527> I think Bradley means that iTunes chooses a seemingly random album cover as artist artwork, the question being how to set it manually. <comment86717> Yes, that is correct <comment86718> In iTunes 10, you could set it. <comment87011> Yup, you could set it in iTunes 10. I once did it for all my artists, but now I can't seem to do it in iTunes 11.
