Weird Mail Attachment behaviour <body> My friend receives an email at a Gmail based account. It has an attachment that can be seen when using the Gmail Web interface. After accessing that email via Apple's Mail.app (OS X, Lion... not iOS) the attachment can no longer be seen (it's there in Gmail, just not in Mail.app).  This friend then forwards me the email from Mail.app and lo and behold I can see the attachment fine.  What the heck is going on? Why does the attachment not appear when he views the email in Mail.app but he can forward it on to me and I see it fine?  <comment54832> Mail on iOS or Mail on OSX? <comment54833> This is on OSX. Specifically Lion. <comment116567> What type of file is the attachment? <comment116570> @ckpepper02 Alas, it has been so long that I no longer recall.
