Denied file read access on file I own and have full r/w permissions on <body> I received an email with a plain text attachment (named 'noname') via Gmail and downloaded it using Chrome from gmail.com. It's a recurring automated report. Everyday I get the file , download it, open it, read it, and enjoy my life. Some days like today I get the file, download it and TextEdit on OS X won't let me open it.  TextEdit reports "The document "noname.txt" could not be opened. You don't have permissions."  A strongGet Info/strong in Finder shows permissions:       ram (Me) Read &amp; Writebr   Staff Read onlybr   Everyone Read only     From a terminal I can do whatever I want to it (read, write, rename...). An codels -l/code shows:br   -rw-r--r--@   1 ram  staff    An codels -le/code shows the same (i.e, no ACLs shown).  What gives?  <answer105167> I'm not sure if this is the same problem I had, but every now and then TextEdit (and not any other application) started showing a dialog like this when I tried to open any file:     strongThe document “test.txt” could not be opened. You don’t have permission./strong      To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File  Get Info.   There were messages like this in codesystem.log/code:  precode9/13/12 10:41:42.952 PM sandboxd[21081]: ([357]) TextEdit(357) deny file-read-data /Users/lauri/Desktop/test.txt 9/13/12 10:41:55.118 PM TextEdit[357]: NSFileVersion tried to tried to add a new generation and failed.

I haven't seen those dialogs after I replaced TextEdit with TextEditPlus, which is basically a non-sandboxed fork of TextEdit.  <answer117877> From debugging a different problem (which showed up as codedeny file-read-data/code in the Console, see the other answer), it seems that sandboxd prevents sandboxed applications from reading quarantined data, so strongI think/strong you'd need to remove the attribute with: code xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/file /code (see for instance https://superuser.com/a/28394/46794). You'd need to prefix the command with codesudo/code if the file didn't belong to your user, but according to your info it does.  The other user reported that using a non-sandboxed application fixed the problem, and this would confirm that sandboxing is at fault.  An aside: When codels/code reports extended attributes with @ next to the permission field, you don't need codels -le file/code, but instead codels -l@ file/code.  <comment123649> Three unrelated questions: Have you considered hard-disk failure? Have you tried opening it with vi in a Terminal? Are there extended attributes on the downloaded file (quarantine or so)? <comment123653> Sorry didn't see the "@". What are the extended attributes on the file, then? <comment123683> The file is a plain text file created by running a script script that outputs plain-text and piping it into `mail` <comment123684> com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms  316Bcom.apple.quarantine   71B <comment123685> Disk Utility doesn't report any problems. Everything from the terminal, vi included, works without a hitch. <comment137916> Thanks for the ls -l@ catch. I totally got that wrong and as a result didn't see the attributes that clarified and confirmed answers suggesting quarantine. All the affected files have, since some update (from Apple?), been tagged with  com.apple.quarantine. <comment137952> IIUC, applications downloading from the Internet are encouraged to tag the downloaded files as quarantined, so that the user is warned when he/she opens them by double-clicking. The mechanism is apparently in place since OS X 10.5, so maybe Chrome was updated to use it. One API to do that is described here: http://ilostmynotes.blogspot.de/2012/06/gatekeeper-xprotect-and-quarantine.html, which points to https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/general/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009250-SW10 for some official docs.
