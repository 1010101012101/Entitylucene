How reliable is to use (buy) a battery for iPhone 5 with 2000+ mAh? <body> There are a lot of batteries like this on eBay, I was wondering about experiences? I know that this is PER SE not recommended and not reliable, but still, I am interested about experiences with it. Might be worth it to ask :) Thanks dudes.
