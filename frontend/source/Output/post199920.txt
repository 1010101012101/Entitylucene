How to change the keymap of a Bluetooth keyboard of iPad? <body> I have a Logitech K480 Bluetooth keyboard. I want to map the kbdcaps lock/kbd key to kbdctrl/kbd. What should I do?  <answer200009> This is not currently possible  <comment240805> I've not heard of any way to do such things on an iPad.  You might check the app store for 3rd party keyboards to see if anyone has produced an app.  I'm not sure that any current app even addresses the bluetooth layouts in addition to the touch screen ones.
