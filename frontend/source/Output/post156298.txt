Impossible to display full screen Flash content on iMac 5k? <body> It seems to be a problem that at least two other persons are facing.  When I watch a video it works fine, but if I switch to full screen, the area where Flash should be rendered is totally black.  The right click is showing me the Flash options which means that the plug-in does not crash, just it does not display anything.  Could anyone solve this issue or should we just wait for some Flash update?  <answer156828> You can "fix" this by disabling the build in chrome pepper flash and enabling the flash player plugin (download flash from adobe first)  Type chrome://plugins/ in your address bar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KwM62.png" alt="enter image description here"  I had the same issue with my mbpr when it was just released with chrome. Have to wait for a pepperflash update. With the mbpr it took a while.  <comment183798> Did you try it with & without hardware acceleration? <comment184719> Works for me, thanks for the answer!
