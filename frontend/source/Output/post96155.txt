iOS Playing Two Sounds/Songs At Once <body> I would like to know, jailbroken or otherwise, if it's possible to get iOS to play two songs or sounds at once.  My very specific goal is to play background white noise loaded from a website and Spotify music at the same time. A big key here would be emSpotify/em music. I don't just want some app that plays it's own white noise over the music that's stored on my iPhone, I want to essentially take two audio sources (from two apps) and play them at once instead of having the phone switch between apps for playback.  I've done my Googling and have come up short (I consistently come across results for developing applications that play two stored audio files at once). So, does anyone know if this is possible, or know of the way to do it if it is?
