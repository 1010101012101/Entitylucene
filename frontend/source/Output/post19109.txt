Create a HTML bundle? <body> How can I create a bundle of HTML/CSS/JS/Image files that can be double-clicked to bring up a web browser? Ideally I would like to be able to use an icon on the file as well.  Is there a plugin for Chrome or Firefox that I could use to save page as a bundle?  <answer19111> Safari and TextEdit allow you to create a .webarchive package.  What I'd recommend is creating your site and open it in Safari to save it as .webarchive.  I'm not sure about customizing the iconâ€¦ not sure if that is supported for webarchive bundles.  <comment20927> brilliant thanks <comment20929> You can change the icon the same way you change icons for any file, command + i, then highlight the icon in the top left hand corner next to the name and paste the image you want. However with webarchives, the preview wont change. it'll stay a page with content
