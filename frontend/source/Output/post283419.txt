Wrong parsing command from date manpage? <body> In the Apple's emdate/em manpage (code$ man date/code) it's written:  precodeFinally the command:       `date -j -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "`date`" "+%s"  can be used to parse the output from date and express it in Epoch time. /code/pre  But when I'm executing this command (code$ date -j -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "`date`" "+%s"/code) in a new Basic Shell from Terminal I get:  precodeFailed conversion of ``Ven 12 mai 2017 08:22:03 CEST'' using format ``%a %b %d %T %Z %Y'' date: illegal time format usage: date [-jnRu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ...              [-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format] /code/pre  Why? Does it same for you? How can I correct it?  emNB: I'm on macOS Sierra 10.12.4 with French settings and Paris local time (UTC +02:00)/em  <answer283421> You are using the following date format:  precode %a %d  %b   %Y %H:%M:%S   %Z Ven 12 mai 2017 08:22:03 CEST /code/pre  So the correct command is  precodedate -j -f "%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z" "`date`" "+%s" /code/pre  <comment357302> Seems to be a locale issue. What happens when you preference the command with `LC_ALL=C`? <comment357303> @fd0 I think you can add this as an answer. I had the same output as OP, but after setting the `LC_ALL` it works as expected. <comment357306> `%T` also works instead of `%H:%M:%S` <comment357307> @fd0 After launching `LC_ALL=C` the `date` command works ! Seems to be an answerâ€¦ In my case, to go back to the old setting: `LC_ALL=fr_FR` <comment357309> For me it's working :  `$ LC_ALL=fr_FR`  `$ date` `Ven 12 mai 2017 11:50:00 CEST`  ``$ date -j -f "%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z" "`date`" "+%s"`` `1494582685`
