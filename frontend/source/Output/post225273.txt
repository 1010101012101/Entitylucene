FileVault account sticking around after account deletion <body> I have file vault encryption turned on. I created a second administration account on my computer and on boot up my main account stopped showing up (before most of the OS has booted and it's asking for a login to decrypt the main filesystem). This was bugging me and I no longer needed the second admin account, so I deleted it. My account still doesn't show up at the file vault login, but the deleted account is still there so I can log in with it's password. Once the OS decrypts itself/boots I get prompted to log in and only my original account is available.   TL;DR: existing account doesn't show up at system boot login, deleted account does  I'm pretty sure it's software, but I'm on a 15" MBP Late-2011 if that makes any difference. I do not have rEFIt installed.   <comment273387> Is related to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/154826/os-x-filevault-login-issue?rq=1. Not sure if that'll solve
