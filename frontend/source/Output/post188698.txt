Messages.app (Mac) does not play sound when message received <body> Why does Messages.app on my Mac (Yosemite) fail to play a sound when a message is received?  On my Mac, I'm hearing sound from other apps. I hear a sound when I drag the "Output volume" in emSystem Preferences/em  emSound/em  emOutput/em.  I hear the ding sound when messages simultaneously arrive on my iPhone and iPad.  In emMessages  Preferences  General  Message received sound/em I have the popup set to "Note (Default)". Changing that popup does not help.  In emSystem Preferences  Notifications  Messages  Play sound for notifications/em is checked. Unchecking and rechecking does not help.  The only odd thing, the only clue, is that in emSystem Preferences  Notifications  Messages/em I found the emMessages alert style/em icons had "None" selected but nonetheless have been seeing the emAlerts/em style notifications appear upon new messages. Perhaps there is some kind of settings file not being updated, and needs to be trashed?  <answer237045> I had the same problem and I found that in System Preferences Sound Sound Effects:  The "Alert volume" was set at zero.  Adjusting it up solved my problem.  <answer242080> I had the same problem, I think I found what it was, for me at least.  System Preferences - Sound Effects - Play sound effects through: Internal Speakers  <comment223431> try a simple task first, use disk utility and repair permissions. try with logging in as different user to see if your user profile needs fixing. <comment223477> What happens if your phone and iPad are off? My MacBook doesn't "ding" if my phone gets the message first. <comment288331> Did you ever find a resolution to this?
