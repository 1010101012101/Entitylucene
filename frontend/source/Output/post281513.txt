Macbook Air display screen problem <body> My macbook worked perfectly fine but then its battery ran out and when I recharged it, my screen looked like this, however, it functions perfectly fine. I cannot seem to figure out what the problem is because nothing happened to it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDumM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment354216> Have you tried restarting the Macbook? <comment354238> Yes I have restarted it multiple times and also run the apple diagnostics test but it says that nothing is wrong with my macbook
