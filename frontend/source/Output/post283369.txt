I think I am really close. Is it possible to add may be google translator to this list? I am not native english and I highly prefer to  try to understand the meaning of the word by reading the explanation on english and if I can't then I will read english-russian translation. Is it possible? <comment357250> @Sharikov Unfortunately not, there's no Google Translate. <comment357251> Okay! Thank you very much. You answered the question perfectly. Ty!
