Change Zoom of Notes.app <body> I have a 2011 15" MacBook Pro with a higher resolution display (1680 x 1050), an option that was offered back then. Unfortunately, in many of the Apple apps the default 100% zoom level displays normal font sizes (12, 14) way too small to be comfortably read.  In most apps, Pages, Safari, TextEdit etc. I can simply adjust the zoom level, so that the display correctly. However, the Notes app doesn't provide that functionality.    Does anyone know of a hack to change the default zoom level of the Notes app?    I don't want to change the emfont size/em, i.e., change the font from from 12pt to 16pt as is suggested elsewhere (and here) since my notes are synced with the iPad and I don't want them to look too big there.br Nor do I want to change the entire emscreen zoom/em (accessibility feature).    Rather I am looking for a way to change the size in which the Notes app emdisplays/em the text on OS X.  Any hints much appreciated.   I know that there is no straightforward way to do this, but the Notes.app must get its information for how many pixels to use for a given point size font, for example 16 pixels for a 12 point font from somewhere, no?  That is what I hope to tweak somehow...
