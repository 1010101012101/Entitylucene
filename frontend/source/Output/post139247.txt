Will everything be erased? And will I get caught? <body> Ok so I updated and I restored my iPod so everything about cydia on my ipod will be erased? If I go to an airport will they be able to tell that my iPod was jailbroken?  <answer139249> Nobody cares about jailbroken iOS devices.  Even Apple only care if you take it for a warranty repair (as handing a jailbroken device to them and saying "this doesn't work" will probably get a response of "well, you jailbroke it").  I would say relax and don't panic.  To answer the first part of the question, doing a system Restore will remove all traces of the jailbreak. It's MUCH harder to jailbreak an iOS device than it is to remove a jailbreak :)  <comment164201> More importantly: will they care if it was jailbroken? Answer: no.

Thank you <comment164206> Any time, no worries :) <comment164209> Apple repaired my broken iPod Touch with Jailbreak - 2 Years ago :D They really don't care about Jailbreaks, except Hardware is damaged by the Jailbreak
