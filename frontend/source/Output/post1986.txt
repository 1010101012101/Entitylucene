iPhone iOS4 Connectivity Profiles <body> Is there any way to set up and easily switch connection profiles in iOS4?  i.e:  Home - Wi-Fi on, Bluetooth off, 3G off  Work - Wi-Fi off, Bluetooth off, 3G off  Car - Wi-Fi off, Bluetooth on, 3G on  etc.  Would prefer an App Store app but would consider a jailbreak app if not available.  <answer1987> If your phone is jailbroken, SBSettings works really well for this. I don't think it supports profiles, but it gives quick access to toggles for all of the services you mentioned. Very helpful for the scenarios you described.  <answer1988> You will definitely have to jailbreak to acheive that kind of functionality.  Personally I gave @Thomas' reply a +1 because that is what I used to use.  Another option is Intelliborn's MyProfiles Beta - which is on sale for $7 via Rock  It emmay/em only support iOS 3.0.1 though.  <comment1714> Are you jailbroken? <comment1715> The other day i saw "Locale for Android". That's way cool, but sadly there is no way to get such a thing for the iPhone (at least non-jailbroken as mine is).
