Moving an application window to another desktop or screen using the keyboard? <body> In Windows, when I press the codewindows key + any arrow button/code the current application window moves. For example: codewindows key + left arrow key/code: the application window moves to the left of the display.  I want to know if this feature is available in OSX. If yes, how do I use it? If it's not a native feature, is there is a strongfree/strong third party application that might enable this feature?  <answer122771> Spectacle supports assigning a shortcut for resizing a window to fill the left or right half of a screen and for moving a window to another screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qAAU.png" alt=""  As does Slate:  precodebind left:ctrl;alt;cmd move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX/2;screenSizeY bind right:ctrl;alt;cmd move screenOriginX+screenSizeX/2;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY alias monitor-macbook 1280x800 alias monitor-dell 1440x900 bind up:ctrl;alt;cmd move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY ${monitor-macbook} bind down:ctrl;alt;cmd move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY ${monitor-dell} /code/pre  Amethyst also supports assigning a shortcut for moving a window to another space. codethrow-screen-2/code (control-option-shift-e) moves a window to the second screen and codethrow-space-2/code (control-option-shift-2) moves a window to the second space.  <comment143288> Related even though it's for Lion: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/43493/how-to-move-window-to-different-desktop-via-keyboard-in-lion <comment143289> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/50330/how-to-arrange-two-windows-easily-to-left-and-right-side
