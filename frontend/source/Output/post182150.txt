OS X Photos app unable to export video <body> I recently uploaded some videos into Photos after compressing them in Handbrake.  Now, when I try to export the video back out of the Photos app, it gives me an error:  img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5er0ome3cf4atj2/Screenshot%202015-04-22%2014.11.55.png?dl=1" alt="results"  Does anyone know 1) why I can't export some videos and 2) how to fix it? I don't want my videos to be forever locked in the Photos app.  <answer183104> Select File &lt; Export &lt; Export Unmodified Original. This will avoid having Photos try to transcode your video.  <answer193301> I get this issue on some movies and in the end copied tehm out of the Photos folder where they are held as mov files.  <comment218502> That did it! Thanks.
