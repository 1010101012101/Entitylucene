How to rotate text in single cell in Pages on Mac? <body> This is what I have now:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WN8rR.png" alt="enter image description here"  And this is what I would like to make:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ofzQw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to do this?  <answer255624> The only way I have found to do this, (and probably the same as you have done to illustrate the question), is to insert a text box or shape and rotate the shape/textbox by 90 degrees. Probably not the solution you are after but a barely workable workaround  <comment318397> It is not the solution, indeed.
