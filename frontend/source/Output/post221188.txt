What is actually happens when moving a file onto/into another file? <body> I was trying to move some files to a directory, because of wrong destination directory path all files are moved to another strongfile/strong.   emCan I undo this action to get my files back? - strongHopefully NO/em/strong  Is there any way to strongtypecast the destination file to a folder/directory/strong? What is actually happening behind the scene when we do like this?  strongUpdate/strong  Command used:  precodemv MyFile.extention /MyFolder /code/pre  <answer221769> To summarize the answers in the comments:  Moving a file using codemv/code writes/moves the source file to the destination path. If you put an existing file as the destination emwithout using/em the code-i/code flag the existing file will be overwritten.  This is the same as deleting it.  Recommendation/possible ways to avoid this in the future:  ul liKeep a backup, especially of important files/li liAlways use the code-i/code flag when using codemv/code to be prompted before overwriting existing files/li liUse the Finder to move files to avoid mistakes via the command line/li /ul  <comment267818> Do you have a backup? As for "typecasting" I believe the `-i` option in `mv` prompts the user before overwriting existing files. <comment267825> No I don't have the backup of the files I moved. And I didn't used `-i` option while doing `mv` command. <comment267826> I don't believe there is an easy way to recover files lost in this manner. If you don't have a backup, it's another "how do I recover deleted files" question. There should be some here on Ask Different, look through them. <comment267827> I didn't deleted them, I have a file into which I move other files. So I think its not about "how do I recover deleted files".   sorry, ` Ask Different` I didn't get this? what is this? <comment267831> Ask Different is the name of this Q&A site, in really big letters at the top left... :| Could you post the command you used? That would be really helpful. Please [edit] your post to include the command, don't comment it. And select it and press Ctrl+K to format it as code. <comment268057> Technically speaking, overwriting a file by moving another one "onto it" is the same as deleting it. So if you don't have a backup, you'll probably be out of luck. <comment268202> @patrix  Thanks. :)  As for the more clarification on that `Technical` section am going to update whole question itself. <comment268203> mv MyFile.extention /MyFolder - this is a standard Unix command and will replace a MyFile.extention in MyFolder if such a file already exists. There is no way to recover from running such a command.
