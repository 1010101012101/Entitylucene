How can I count all words or characters in a Powerpoint pptx file? <body> Is there a simple way to count the characters of all text fields in a Powerpoint presentation?  I tried exporting to Rich Text Format (code.rtf/code) to do the count in MS Word, but the export function only exports some text fields (outline text) and misses small annotations, lists, etc.  Some tools like emCount Anything/em or emAnycount/em are not available for Mac OSX.  <answer295435> Does the built-in count not work?  Find the word count of your PowerPoint 2016 for Mac presentation  <comment373072> No, as opposed to the function in MS Word, it counts words but not characters.
