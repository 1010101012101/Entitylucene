Keyboard remapping in OS X 10.9 <body> Is it feasible to remap my keyboard mapping in OS X Mavericks? For example, I want to swap kbdq/kbd and kbd`/kbd (backticks), since I don't require typing kbdq/kbd too much and like to owe the position to another key, such as backticks. I've used codekeyremap4macbook/code to change kbd:/kbd and kbd;/kbd, and kbd"/kbd and kbd'/kbd and have no issues on it, but it looks like the app only allows to change on some specific keys like kbd;/kbd, kbd'/kbd, kbd?/kbd, kbd{/kbd, etc. and not on those alphabetical keys.  Also, I got some video tutorials to modify those keys, but it doesn't work on Mavericks since the system preferences look a bit different than in the prior versions.  So is it feasible to remap my keys in Mavericks? And how can I modify it?  Thanks.  <answer112381> The easy way to do this would be to use Keyboard Maestro and just create two macros, one for 'q' which inserts '`' and one for '`' which inserts 'q'  It also does a ton of other awesome stuff and is one of my favorite OS X utilities, but it’s not free (there's a free trial 30 days it’s ~ $35 IIRC).  However, my guess is that you could emalso/em do it using KeyRemap4MacBook using the codeprivate.xml/code feature under "Misc &amp; Uninstall"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dNj6K.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I am not qualified to explain what needs to be in the private.xml file, however, I can point you to the documentation for A simple example of private.xml which shows some examples and explains the format of the file.  There is also a free Mac OS X app Key Codes which you will probably want to use to help you find the correct key code values.  <comment131450> Have you tried [PCKeyboardHack](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/pckeyboardhack.html.en "PCKeyboardHack - Software for OS X - pqrs.org")? <comment131481> I'm sure keyremap4macbook can do what you need.  Check the manual more closely.  Another option is Ukelele. <comment131924> Thanks. It looks like I can edit the xml file to make any key remapping work in my system.
