Safari will spontaneously visit URL while I type <body> On my old MacBook Air and even on my brand new Retina MacBook Pro (which was set up as a new computer), if I open a new tab and quickly start typing a URL or search in the bar, Safari will sometimes truncate whatever it is I was typing and act as if I had pressed Return.   I believe this has something to do with the search suggestions/seek time for bookmarks but it happens stochastically so I can't determine the root cause.   <answer95593> This happens if you:  ol lihave enabled Google as your default search engine/li lihave enabled Google Instant within your Google search settings/li /ol  I have this same situation occur on my Chrome.  <comment112112> is it possible that you unknowingly hit the return? I do that sometimes, and generate lots of typos :) <comment112113> try this and remap your keyboard (just temporary) and reassign the return key to test the theory above :)  http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/ <comment112120> It just happened again. It corresponds precisely with the lag in smart search (history/bookmark autocomplete + google search suggestions).   I definitely did not press Return. <comment112134> I have the same problem! Even I thought it was just me accidentally hitting return, but I have a mechanical keyboard, so it can't be. <comment112150> I've decided to disable Google Instant from Safari; this is done within Safari Preferences through the tab "Privacy". The last checkbox says "Prevent search engine from providing suggestions".
