iPhoto claims there is an update available <body> iPhoto came with my Mac. It is currently version 9.1.1.  When I open iPhoto, it pops up:  "An iPhoto update is available. Would you like to open Software Update?"  Then it offers me to start Software Update, but it finds no updates. Some people said I should check in the AppStore, but it asks me to pay if I want to take iPhoto from there.  I am running Mac OS X 10.7.2  I believe this update is to enable Photo Stream.  <answer28280> Have you moved or renamed iPhoto?  <comment32453> aha - that is a possibility indeed <comment32457> You are right, I moved it back and now Software Updates says there is an update.
