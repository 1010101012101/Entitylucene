Scaled Resolution switching interfering with Terminal startup <body> I saved a window group in Terminal and set that as my default startup group in Terminal preferences "On startup open: window group..."  If I then switch my resolution scaling from "More Space" to "Best (Retina)"  all of my terminal windows shrink to fit (and oddly get wider by two columns).  I think application state saving gets in the way because these fat-squat terminal windows are all I get until I resize them all by hand.  Is there any way to get the windows to resize back to full height when switching back to normal resolution?  <answer123539> I did discover a non-ideal solution when I was researching for this question:  If I close all the windows I can then use the Window  Open Window Group command to get back to my nice windows, though the history is emptied out of each window.  I hope someone else is able to answer this question better.
