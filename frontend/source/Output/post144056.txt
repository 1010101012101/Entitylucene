Is iMovie available on the MacBook Air 11 inch? <body> Is iMovie available on the MacBook Air 11 inch? The iMovie system requirements say that the minimum resolution is 1280x800, while the 11 inch Air has 1366x768.  <answer144057> It will run. It should even be pre-installed. Might not be the best user experience, though, with limited window size. Get as much RAM as you can afford.  <comment169753> Yes. iMovies works perfectly fine on the MacBook Air 11 inch.
