Both iPhone 6 cameras show multicolour lines <body> I couldn't find any information about that problem,  First of all, it's not always like that, sometime it's working fine.  I thought that it is a problem with the iOS because it's affecting both cameras, but a settings reset didn't helped, should I try a full reset of the device?  I just found out today that when I apply some pressure on the back of the device the pattern change, so I'm not sure that it is a software problem.  Is this a common problem that occurred in earlier version? Does this have a name so I can look for more information?  If it helps, I think that when it occurs, it's in both cameras at the same time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n6xIz.jpg" width="320" alt="Back camera" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IsnEb.jpg" width="320" alt="Front camera"  <comment187033> I've heard issues of the front camera becoming mis-aligned, but not both.  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1805832 <comment187064> Take it to an Apple store, if possible. It's physically defective.
