Skype for Business Mac Chat History Storage Location <body> I downloaded Skype for Business on Mac and I have tons of Chats saved, but there is no setting for deleting them after X amount of days or a way to delete them in mass. Currently, I have have to right click then delete on every single chat.  Does anyone know where the Chat history is stored on Mac?  <answer281042> Open Finder and navigate to ~/Library/Application Support/Skype/. The “~” sign means your home folder. To find your home folder, open Finder and in the main menu, select Go  Home or press Command (Apple) + Shift + H keys. It is the folder that has your Skype Name.   An app restart may be required after making modifications.

There is no folder for Skype for Business in the Library/Application Support/ folder <comment353615> Have you tried the /Library/Application Support/ file instead, there is a difference when the tilde sign is used. <comment353616> If not, it is likely stored in the Exchange account that is linked to. <comment353617> Also, have you seen [this post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259442/where-is-the-skype-for-business-for-mac-log-location?rq=1) it says to try `~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.SkypeForBusiness`
