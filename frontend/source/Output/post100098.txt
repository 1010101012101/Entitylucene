Make terminal transparent to show wallpaper <body> The opacity option of the Gnome terminal in Ubuntu had a neat behavior, which showed the desktop wallpaper instead of the other windows behind it.  Has anyone been able to make Mac Terminal, or an alternative terminal app, do this?  I know you can set a terminal wallpaper, which squashes and stretches with the terminal window.  Thanks!  <answer100100> This can be done simply by typing this command in the terminal:  " defaults write com.apple.terminal TerminalOpaqueness '0.85' "  Without the quotes of course.   You can adjust the opaqueness level to whatever you like   <comment117821> The OP specifically wants to see the desktop wallpaper, not other windows behind the Terminal window. This is just a round-about way of changing the Opacity setting under Preferences  Settings.
