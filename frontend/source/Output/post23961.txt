Homebrew permission issues <body> I basically installed Homebrew as described at https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation.  However, my user account ist not an Administrator account, therefore I substituted my user identity with the one of user admin (codesu - admin/code), who is an Administrator. Then, as user admin, I installed Homebrew by executing code/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"/code. Moreover, I installed giter8 by running codebrew update &amp;&amp; brew install giter8/code.  Now, as user admin I can run command codeg8/code which is installed in code/usr/local/bin/code. However, using my regular restricted user account, I cannot run this command, as its permissions are too restrictive:  precode$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/g8 lrwxr-x---  1 admin  admin  29 Sep  2 11:12 /usr/local/bin/g8 -&gt; ../Cellar/giter8/0.2.0/bin/g8 /code/pre  As you can see, codeg8/code has permissions 750 and is owned by codeadmin:admin/code; so, as regular user, I have no chance to run codeg8/code. But, what is even more strange, some crucial folders have similar - too restrictive IMHO - permissions:  precodedrwxr-x---  3 admin  admin   102 Sep  2 11:12 Cellar drwxr-x---  7 admin  admin   238 Sep  2 11:12 Library /code/pre  Thus, even after fixing the permissions of symbolic link codeg8/code (readable and executable by all users), regular users cannot execute commands / run programs installed via codebrew install.../code, as regular users cannot access folder codeCellar/code, nor folder codeLibrary/code, which both contain crucial files for most programs.  Is this by design, or is this a bug?  <answer77553> Very old question but I thought I'd mention that some people (including me) codechown/code the homebrew code/usr/local//code directory so you can run everything in it without issue. I used:  precodesudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local /code/pre  <comment26770> Nope, my brew permissions are fine and let anyone else on the system use the binaries installed with an admin user. Did you check your `umask`? <comment27069> Good point: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/7430
