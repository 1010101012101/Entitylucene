How to show file extensions in finder for all files <body> I'm using the Finder Preferences option, but it still won't show the extensions!  <answer142328> Most likely the files you are wondering about do not have any extension associated with them. Unlike Windows and many other operating systems Mac OS does not require a file extension and can use meta data stored in the filesystem instead.  More about Resource Fork and File Type/Creator.  After some searching around it appears to be fairly complicated to take information from the meta data and use that to add extension to files.  <comment167653> Do you notice any change with some files when you select or deselect the option? <comment167908> Well the extensions started showing after a while (I'm not sure if I had to open a new Finder window or not). But either way... its working now.
