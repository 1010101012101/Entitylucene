I have a company MacBook Pro and I no longer can see my username on the login screen <body> I have a MacBook Pro given to me by my IT department. The macbook has 2 accounts:   ul liLocal Administrator/li liMy Account/li /ul  Today, when I turned on the Macbook, my account didn't appear in list of accounts to sign into. The only account on the MacBook is the Local Administrator, and I don't have its password.  Is this a bug, or have I done something wrong? I don't remember deleting anything or even remotely playing with anything that could do this.  I am using OS X El Capitan 10.11  with a 2015 MacBook Pro.  <answer248717> Fixed! Had to go IT department.  The IT Department didn't enable/setup Filevault properly. They just had to login with their credentials and set it  <comment308081> Since this is a managed system, owned by the company you work for, you should contact the IT department. <comment308086> Does "Other" appear? <comment308087> @Peanut No. only 'local adminstrator' <comment308088> What appears when you click Local Administrator? <comment308091> just a textField to enter the password for it. <comment308094> What happens if you type your password? <comment308097> :) Obviously, it does't go through.
