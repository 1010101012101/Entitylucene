Are iTunes Match songs streamed over HTTP and do they use CDN? <body> I do not have iTunes Match yet but I am interested in understanding the underlying logistics. We know that Apple built a new data center for iCloud and Match in North Carolina, but when you stream/download a song from iTunes Match, has anyone seen if it's plain streaming over HTTP, what URLs are used and what CDN provider is supporting it?
