Where does Photos.app store the iPhone videos I've imported? <body> I use my iPhone to take photos and video, then import them onto my Macbook using the new Photos app.   Now I'm trying to find the original videos so I can put them on an external hard drive for a friend to edit. I notice that within the Photos app, if I control-click on my videos, there is no "Reveal in Finder" option. If I do "Get Info" and look at the filename, it says codeIMG_6517.MOV/code. But when I do a Spotlight search, that file does not come up.  Where does the new Photos app store the originals for photos and videos I've imported?  <answer222237> I figured out the answer by going to codeTerminal/code and doing codefind ./ -name *.MOV -print/code.   The codePhotos Library/code is different from the codeiPhoto Library/code. If you've upgraded from iPhoto to the new Photos app, then for any video files you've imported, you can find the originals at:  precode~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters   /code/pre  This way, you don't need to export your video files; you can just copy them.  ol liIn Finder, go to Go  Go to Folder /li liEnter code~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/code/li liNavigate to whatever video files you want and copy them to your destination. /li /ol
