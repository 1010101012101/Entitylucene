How do I install QuickTime from a .pkg? <body> I'm on a laptop running OS X 10.3.9 (Panther) and I've downloaded "QuickTime 7.5 for Panther updater" -- and for the life of me I can't figure out how to install it.  The file mounts as a disk image. When I doubleclick it I see a codeQuickTime75_Panther.pkg/code file which opens when I double click. Inside I see a lot more files but nothing that lets me install. Help?  <answer14950> code.pkg/code files are so called packages, which can be installed by codeInstaller.app/code, so try right-clicking the code.pkg/code file and hit codeOpen with -&gt; Installer/code  <answer14951> You can install the .pkg file using the following command on Terminal.app(assuming your .pkg file is in Downloads directory).    precodesudo installer -pkg ~/Downloads/QuickTime75_Panther.pkg /Applications/ /code/pre  The above command will install QT on the Applications directory.  <comment16143> However by default .pkg files open with Installer so you have changed something on your machine. <comment16147> @Mark you're right. Should have mentioned that. Thank you.
