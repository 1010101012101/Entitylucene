How to change the the screensaver using terminal (without using Preference Panel)? <body> I would like to change the screensaver "Flurry" by the Ken Burns without using the Preference panel, directly using terminal or command.  <answer160005> ol liQuit System Preferences./li liLocate the relevant plist in terminal by  precodels ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.*.plist /code/pre  You should see something like  precode/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.0B39A0DE-D1EE-59FF-85C0-6EA16FCB015B.plist /code/pre  Note that hyphen-delimited alphanumeric string. It might be host dependent, judging from that codeByHost/code directory name. (Or maybe it's not. At the moment I have only one Mac at my disposal so I can't tell.)/li liIn terminal, run the following commands (with the hyphen-delimited alphanumeric string replaced by what you found in the last step):  precodedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.0B39A0DE-D1EE-59FF-85C0-6EA16FCB015B.plist moduleDict -dict moduleName iLifeSlideshows path /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/iLifeSlideshows.saver type 0 defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.0B39A0DE-D1EE-59FF-85C0-6EA16FCB015B.plist /code/pre/li /ol  That's it. There's one problem with this approach: it seems that multiple screensavers are registered with this codeiLifeSlideshows.saver/code (e.g. Classic), and I couldn't locate the plist controlling which one is shown. But according my testing, if you've chosen "Ken Burns" in System Preferences and later changed it to "Flurry", then when you run the above commands you will get "Ken Burns" back. Otherwise, no guarantee â€” for instance, you might get "Classic" if that's the last used one from codeiLifeSlideshows.saver/code.  <answer283374> Environment:  brMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) brmacOS Sierra version 10.12.4  codedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleDict -dict moduleName Flurry path /System/Library/Screen\ Savers/Flurry.saver/ type 0/code  to check:br codedefaults -currentHost read com.apple.screensaver/code br or br codeopen /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/code brbr adapted from here: brhttp://krypted.com/mac-security/mac-setting-screen-saver-from-the-cli/ br(But it needed to be updated/improved)
