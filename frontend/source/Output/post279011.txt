Problem with A1314 Aluminum BT Keyboard After Cleaning <body> I wiped the keyboard, while it was turned on, and have locked one or more of the keys as if it was pressed. Anyone know how to reset the keyboard to turn this off?  I believe it's the Tab key. After I cleaned it, the desktop was in focus, which contains four files on it. They in-turn were changing focus rapidly as I could see them being highlighted, one after another. I turned off the Bluetooth, it stopped, and was able to replicate that response by holding down the Tab key on my MBA5,2's keyboard.  I removed the paired keyboard and tried repairing it but I can't enter the numbers to do so. I found this article about resetting the keyboard pairing but that does nothing to reset the A1314, itself.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated!  <comment351180> How did you clean it? Dry cloth? Damp cloth? Did you use a cleaning solution? If so, what did you use? <comment352312> I sprayed a cleaner on a cloth and wiped it, but that's not the problem. The problrm is the keyboard wasn't off and thus some sort of key combination was pressed when wiping it vigorously locked the Tab key as if permanently pressed.  Now, I need a method to reverse that, hopefully there is a reset for the keyboard to do it. <comment352313> A key combination? I highly doubt it. I'd guess the cleaning solution you used broke the keyboard. Which is why I asked what it was, as some cleaning solutions are known to damage keyboards. <comment352418> I only sprayed a mist. It's not the liquid. It's the fact I failed to turn it off before cleaning. I've seen this before when I cleaned a keyboard by only wiping it with my hand. Certain key combinations will lock-up a keyboard.  If it didn't work at all, I'd agree.
