iTunes search API returns different app icons for 60x60 and 1024x1024 <body> At first, I have to say that I am not sure whether I should ask this question on stackoverflow or on AskDifferent. I decided to use AskDifferent because this question is not programming-specific.  My question:br I use the iTunes search API to get information about some apps. I use the iTunes lookup (codehttp://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=[some app id]/code) URL to get this information. The return dictionary contains two links for the app icon:    ul licodeartworkUrl60/code  /li licodeartworkUrl512/code  /li /ul  The urls after the specific links point to the app icon.br The problem is that the image returned for the codeartworkUrl60/code key is not the same as the image returned for the codeartworkUrl512/code key.    strongExample:/strong (I'm sorry that the second image is so much bigger, that's because it's the big artwork) Vizzywig 4Kbr codeartworkUrl60/code: img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dkr1z695wpflnrr/app_icon_example_big.png?dl=0" alt=""br codeartworkUrl512/code: img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lmouhbxl4btrho8/app_icon_example_small.png?dl=0" alt=""  <answer147123> Apps can have different artwork. Whilst Apple recommends simply scaling your app icon for iTunes Artwork, there's nothing preventing them from being different images.  <comment173430> I understand that, but why should somebody upload different icons for the same app? <comment173436> @Lukas They may wish to have a more detailed icon, or a different colour scheme, or any other reason. There's no concrete answer and depends entirely on the developer. <comment173440> @Lukas It's the developers choice. It's not like every developer does the same.
