Drive speeds ... PCIe vs external thunderbolt SSD <body> I have a new 2014 MacBook Pro with 1TB internal PCIe SSD. Blackmagic Disk Speed Test is reporting read/write speeds of over 900MB/s.  I am debating whether to swap this machine for a 512GB one (saving $500) and using an external Thunderbolt SSD drive, which would be cheaper and more practical.  My questions are:  ol liIs that 900MB speed realistic? Seems incredibly fast./li liCould an external Thunderbolt SSD be that fast? Theoretically Tb can do 10Gb/s ~ 1200 MB/s.../li /ol  <answer198784> ol liThe 900MB speed is realistic, this is achieved on a few of apple's new mac offerings. /li liAn external Thunderbolt SSD would not be as fast, the only way to make it the same speed (or possibly faster) is if you have a multidrive thunderbolt enclosure running in something like Raid-0 with SSDs in all slots. /li /ol  The prior enclosure would be rather expensive though. It is probably best to have as much of that internal storage as possible as that is not easily upgradable. I would stay with the 1TB model more internal storage is always better.  <comment166058> Well, the reported speeds seem to be realistic. http://9to5mac.com/2013/11/04/latest-macbook-pro-15-gets-blazing-ssd-performance-thanks-to-4-channel-pcie/ <comment166062> I have benchmarked the PCIe SSD on several iMacs and MBPs and found I can get around 800MB/s sustained bandwithd out of them for sequential accesses. I also benchmarked a Pegasus Thunderbolt RAID and found it maxed out around 600MB/s. There is a video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emzjIdILD08 <comment166087> Wow, that is incredible. But can someone tell me the speed of an SSD connected via Thunderbolt? There are very few out there, same for enclosures.
