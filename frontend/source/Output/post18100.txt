"Open folder in new window" for Finder? <body> In Finder, how do you open a folder in a new window, while the existing window keeps the same view?     All file managers I've ever used (on Linux only) have something like "Open folder in new window" in the right-click menu for a folder.  Does Finder have this feature in a hidden way, or is there another file manager I should be using on Mac?  <answer18102> Just hold down the Command key (Cmd) while double clicking the folder and it will open in a new Finder window.  <answer18885> I typically would tap 2 fingers on the Finder, and choose "New Finder Window" That is assuming you enable Two Finger tap to trigger Right Mouse Button click  <answer36957> Command + Click on a folder opens what ever items you have selected in the current window. So if you have 3 folders selected, you will open each folder in a separate window - Annoying in some instances, but very useful in others.   Otherwise you can goto Finder  Preference and tick the "Always open folders in a new window" option.   <comment19783> Interesting. It works, but often brings up two windows, one what I want, the other some other (random?) folder. <comment19785> The Control key seems to do the same thing, but w/o the multiple windows coming up. <comment19798> If you hold down Ctrl and click, you'll bring up the contextual menu. Cmd-key does work all times here. Maybe you accidentally selected two folders? <comment19816> If i select several folder, Command+click brings up all. That was the problem. But still, Control+click brings up a new window just like I want, and no more even if other folders are selected.  For context menu, I right-click. <comment42013> The Command key also works to select multiple non-contiguous items in a list, such as a list of folder items in a Finder window. What's likely happening is that you already had an item selecte din the Finder window and by Command-clicking the first time, you selected a second one. A way to avoid this is to single-click on the desired item first, so only that one is selected in the list, and *then* Command-double click it. <comment155231> Also don't forget to switch off the option to open new folders in tabs in Finder Preferences if you switched it on.
