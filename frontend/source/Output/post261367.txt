Apple ID not recognised <body> My iphone 5s (ios 9 - unable to download ios10) restarted itself and sent me to the "hello" screen. After connecting through the wifi, it 'activated' my phone, but is asking for the "activation lock" which requires my apple id and password, this is registered to an email i no longer use and therefore do not remember the password. I went onto my email account that it was registered on but found nothing. After clicking on the "forgot apple id/password" i entered my details but said that an Apple Id could not be found, what can I do to reset up my phone?????? HELP
