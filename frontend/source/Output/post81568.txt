A modern and faster alternative to Disk Inventory X <body> Disk Inventory X was kind of nice, but it is painfully slow.  Are there any modern and faster alternatives?  I only care about the disk space, and not about the file type stats and about the graph which Disk Inventory X displays.  <answer81582> OmniGroup offers a free utility called OmniDisksweeper which lists files/folders sorted by size.      OmniDiskSweeper is really great at what it does: showing you the files on your drive, in descending order by size, and letting you delete them easily! It scans your disks as quickly as possible and shows you the facts â€” if a file doesn't make the cut to stay, just click the big Delete button and be done with it. It's a fast, easy way to find those large files cluttering up your drive and clearing them out for new, better things. Make sure you want them gone, though. There's no going back   <answer151092> I think DiskInventory is as fast or slow as any of the others. If the disk is big, it slower than on a little one, and of course, on a SSD it is really fast. Allthough it is from 2006, I think it isn't bad coded, and it still works on my 10.9. It gives more info than you need, but you can ignore that, as long as you find what you need. I guess what takes time is the reading of the disc, an app without the details of kind of info won't, as far as I think, really take much less. I am using it for ages now, there was a time in mavericks it didnt work, now it goes well. I haven't tried grand perspective, it seems to make the same (with more alternatives which you anyhow don't seem to need), but is fresher.  http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net  <answer179753> Daisy Disk seems to be faster, but costs money. This process will always take longer than you want, though (I don't think OSX allows access to disk index files).  You can try one of the Linux based tools, such as PhileSight and see what happens too. Will be alot quicker if it works.  <answer274396> The top alternative according to alternativeTo (as well as my own sample usage) is JDiskReport.   The thing I liked most about it is that it shows a clear status of the ongoing scan, as well as a time estimate for when it is expected to finish. The others I tried at best just show a "spinny" and you have no idea if the program is stuck or what.   This was actually a game changer in my case for two reasons:  ol liI realized I had an 8TB mounted network share those programs were scanning, which would have taken forever (assuming they didn't crash / run out of memory before)./li liI had one folder with millions of files in it, which basically chokes out all such tools, but at least now I knew what that folder was so I could investigate further./li /ol  <answer286310> Starting with codemacOS Sierra/code, codemacOS/code comes with an in-built app from codeApple/code called codeStorage Management/code, which is a part of codeSystem Information/code package. In different tabs it shows you the largest apps installed, as well as a folder viewer with their sizes listed. A special tab shows the largest files over all of your folders, which I find very practical.  To launch codeStorage Management/code open codeSpotlight Search/code by hitting codeCommand/code + codeSpace/code, type codeStorage Management/code and hit codeEnter/code.  Pros:  ul liFree,/li liFast,/li liProvided by Apple, so it knows what it's doing./li /ul  You can find more information here.  <answer295329> I can heartily recommend ncdu if you're looking for a text (ncurses) based alternative. One of the fastest I've found.  <comment94036> The speed is primarily a function of disc size, number of files and disc speed. I doubt whether other applications can be significantly faster <comment94038> @patrix uh? If, for instance, it was badly coded, of course there might be faster alternatives. How can you know it is state-of-the-art? <comment94039> Edited to point out I only care about disk space and not the other fancy stuff. <comment94040> I didn't say it's state of the art. But traversing a filesystem and gathering statistics is bound to be slow due to hardware effects. And whether the application just reads file sizes or also the other stuff doesn't really matter. But let's see whether somebody comes up with answers. <comment94041> https://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnidisksweeper/ maybe? Not graphical though <comment94050> @patrix this would be great, if only was a little better (no command to move files to the bin, only to delete them immediatly). Still helpful though (post it as an answer, maybe?). <comment94054> Orders of magnitude faster than Disk Inventory X, it would be great if not for some quirks, such as not being able to right click the files (to either open in finder or send them to the bin): it can only delete them. Still much better, though. <comment123623> Update: you _can_ open the files, only using a specific icon down right or down left, but _not_ right clicking, or through the menu bar. I reiterate: much better than the alternative, but it has so many UI mistakes... <comment138401> "And whether the application just reads file sizes or also the other stuff doesn't really matter": in fact, the file size is often in a separate place than the file contents, and that makes a lot of difference on rotational disks. <comment185364> The problem with OmniDiskSweeper is that it does _not_ display a _visual_ tree map like Disk Inventory X. Without the tree map it is impossible to find large files in otherwise small folders simply by scanning the image for large rectangles. <comment185366> Disk Inventory X is definitely slower than both OmniSweeper and GrandPerspective on my MacBook Pro with 500GB SSD. That said, GrandPerspective is IMHO a _much better_ alternative to Disk Inventory X than OmniSweeper simply because GrandPerspective also includes the visual tree map without which it is virtually impossible to find single large files. With the tree map you can simply scan the image for large rectangles (large files or large folders). <comment185367> ...and Disk Inventory X (which has served me well) constantly crashes during scan on OS X Mavericks. <comment263825> This is a great replacement for Disk Inventory X.  I do miss the visual tree map, but the browser view works and forces a different flow. <comment291609> Grandperspectiv is seeing frequent updates currently. This is the correct answer to the original question. <comment293657> This helped a ton! thank you. I just removed over 90GB from the downloads directory. hahahaha <comment325293> For homebrew users: `brew cask install omnidisksweeper` <comment344803> http://alternativeto.net/software/disk-inventory-x/?platform=mac <comment365248> `brew cask install grandperspective` <comment372879> I mean it's pretty useless compared to these other tools. The storage app won't show or include ~/Library at all, which contained about 60GB of Spotify cache.
