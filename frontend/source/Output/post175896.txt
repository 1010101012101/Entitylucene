MPlayerX frame skip keyboard shortcut <body> While playing a video in MPlayerX the right and left arrows skip ahead and back 10s respectively. When paused, the right arrow goes ahead 1 frame but the left arrow still goes back 10s.  How do I skip only 1 frame back? Is there some way to assign the left-arrow-while-paused to do this?  Could the "Extra options" in the "advanced" section of the preferences be useful here? is there any documentation on how to use this?  <answer205991> Did some research, looks like you can change values using some commands, havent tried it myself though.  http://blog.mplayerx.org/blog/2013/02/01/hidden-settings/
