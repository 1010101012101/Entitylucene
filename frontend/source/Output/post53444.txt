Built-in text editor in Terminal <body> Is there a built-in text editor in the terminal on Lion?  (Like, for example, codenano/code on Linux.)  <answer53446> Yes, nano and vim for example are installed with Mac OS X.  <answer53448> vim, emacs, nano and pico are all available by default with OS X 10.7.4:  precode/Users/ian &gt; which nano /usr/bin/nano  /Users/ian &gt; which vim /usr/bin/vim  /Users/ian &gt; which emacs /usr/bin/emacs  &gt; which pico /usr/bin/pico /code/pre  <comment61128> umm... like `vim`, `emacs`? <comment61130> They've been on every Mac I've ever used since the 10.2 days, and I'd be shocked if OS X had *ever* not included them. <comment61131> @Jay Did you even try running `nano` in the Terminal? <comment61132> @CajunLuke No, for some reason I thought it wasn't there. Oh well. <comment61155> And for hard core users there is even `/bin/ed` :-) <comment61156> @CajunLuke: actually, nano was added in 10.4 (although pico, the editor it's based on, was in at least 10.3).  I can't say for certain about emacs, but I'm pretty sure vi was there in [Rhapsody Server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Server_1.0). <comment61186> @GordonDavisson Nano was definitely around in 10.2 and 10.3. I remember using it (and I've an old 10.3 Mac I can check on if needed). <comment61187> I disagree with the heavy down vote penalty you've incurred. This is an easy question to answer if you have a Mac in front of you. But if you don't have a Mac at hand or don't own one yet and are wondering what the command line experience is like this is potentially useful information. Just because something seems obvious or is well known to you doesn't mean that's the case for everyone else. <comment61207> @CajunLuke: I just checked under 10.3.9 computer (server version, but that shouldn't matter) and it has pico but not nano.  I don't have a 10.2 machine handy anymore... <comment61211> @GordonDavisson I'll bet nano is symlinked to hard-linked to pico. I learned to use the command-line when I was using 10.2, and the editor I used was nano.
