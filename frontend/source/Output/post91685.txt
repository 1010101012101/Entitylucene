10.8 Notification Center occasionally freezes system <body> My Mac Pro 5,1 sometimes freezes when I open the Notification Center, and it usually recovers by itself about 10 minutes later.  I'd like to know why and how to fix it. When this happens, the notification center will be half open, as shown in the screenshot. This happens about once a week, seemingly at random. Symptoms include:  ul liCmd-Tab does not work/li liExpose / Mission Control Spaces does not work./li liNotification Center is frozen/li liDock will not appear/li liI can't type text in any application/li liI can't drag to reposition windows on the screen/li liCmd-Opt-Esc opens the Force Quit window, which functions properly/li liSpotlight works properly/li /ul  Here is the Console's "all messages" log for a few minutes before and after the crash. http://pastebin.com/NuGesUdy  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9LGg9.png" alt="screenshot" UPDATE:  I've discovered two related things.  When this problem happens, Activity Monitor shows Dock using about 100% CPU. Meanwhile, fseventer shows that the .db files in ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/ are being accessed constantly. Also, I think I've tracked down the culprit to the MySQL installation part of XAMPP.  It turns out I can unfreeze the system every time by turning off MySQL. I'd still like to know why, and how to fix this.  <answer91698> From Apple Support Communities Thread:     ol   liRestart your computer and hold down kbdcmd/kbd + kbdR/kbd to boot into recovery mode./li   liFrom the menu bar, select Utilities - Terminal/li   liType in "emresetpassword/em" without the quotes./li   liIn the window that pops up, there will be a button in the lower right corner labeled "Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs".  Click on that.  It will take a moment to complete./li   liWhen it finishes, simply restart the computer from the Apple menu at the top right.  Your computer will restart normally./li   /ol   <answer92657> emEdit: this was not meant to be an answer, simply a comment:/em  I have this issue once in a while as well. From the last time it occurred I believe it happened when I tried to dismiss an alert while having the notification center still open, but I think it also has happened for nothing in other occasions.  But in any case, the last time I got it back from freezing, after pressing a million keys - so no solution found.   I can add that kbdCMD/kbd+kbdspace bar/kbd opens emSpotlight/em just fine and from there you can open the emActivity Monitor/em window. What I can't say is if it is possible to control that window, because all of the screen is frozen except for the emnotification center/em area and the apple logo.  The last time I also tried restarting Finder from the emapple logo/em menu, but I can't be sure if that helped unfreezing or not.  <answer104107> I recovered without rebooting :  ol liopen Activity Monitor via Spotlight (kbdCmd/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd)/li liuse kbdTab/kbd key to go to filter, type in "notif"/li liUse kbdTab/kbd key and kbdArrows/kbd keys to select the process "Notification Center"/li liType kbdAlt/kbd + kbdCmd/kbd + kbdQ/kbd then kbdReturn/kbd in order to quit Notification center/li /ol  <comment107703> This happens for me too. I'm waiting for apple to push in a major update soon. Wait for WWDC'13 :) <comment108699> Thank you for your comment, but this is not an answer. <comment108711> Of course it isn't. It wasn't intended to be. I added info that the original response did not have. <comment108743> Yeah, which is helpful and nice, but the way this site is organized means that that kind of response should be written as a comment rather than an answer.  See http://apple.stackexchange.com/about <comment108773> Yeah, that's a good point. I guess I could use some help finding that other than where I'm writing right now.

The issue is that commenting is a privilege that needs 50 reputation points to unlock. http://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment <comment108831> That goal will probably get more difficult to obtain if any more negatives votes should occur on any input I may add. Oh, well. <comment108985> Unfortunately, since I have a non-EFI graphics card, I can't boot in Recovery Mode.  But how is your suggestion different from repairing permissions using Disk Utility? <comment109013> @Elliott Disk Utility repairs permissions in files that the OS installed; Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs resets all permissions even on files you've created yourself, in your home folder. <comment109030> Oh ok I see.  Do you know how to do this from within the OS without rebooting into Recovery Mode? <comment122607> Thanks for your comment, but this is not an answer. I also have figured out how to recover, in this case I have to kill 3 processes: Dock, com.apple.dock.extra, and mysqld.
