Is it possible to take a video screenshot (screenshow?) of what's occurring on a Macbook Pro's screen? <body> I've got an unusual situation which I cannot explain. I thought to take a video of what I'm seeing on the screen, but realized I didn't know how to do that.  Is there a way to take a video of the screen's activities? From terminal, shortcut keys, or another method?  <answer126841> You can use strongQuickTime Player.app/strong for this. Open it and in codeFile/code menu there's codeNew Screen Recording/code or press kbd⌃/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdN/kbd.
