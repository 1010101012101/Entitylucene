How can I move my notes from one folder (gmail) to another (iCloud)? <body> I use Notes on my iPhone, iPad and Macbook Pro. Of late, the gmail syncing has been unreliable. I want to move all my gmails notes to the iCloud folder.   There doesn't seem to be a way to 'move' a note, apart from deleting and recreating it.   My question is: strongHow can I move my notes from one folder (gmail) to another (iCloud)?/strong  <answer232916> The following worked for me:   ol liGo to the folder that represents the notes stored on the external server/li liClick codeEdit/code and choose the notes you need moved, or just swipe from the right on the individual note and tap codeMove/code/li liChoose the destination target and folder: either local, or iCloud/li /ol  This actually moved my note from an external, IMAP-connected server to my iCloud.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/LCIWb9w.png" alt="screenshot"  The screenshot shows both codeOn My iPhone/code and codeiCloud/code options not greyed out, which confirms they're both available, and the note in question is currently located elsewhere.    But yes, it does seem like it won't let us do it the other way around, that is, move the notes strongfrom/strong iCloud/iPhone emto/em an external server: it simply doesn't show up in the destinations list.

Make sure you have the latest version of the app installed.  <comment364915> Also: if you have an OS X / Mac OS device connected to the same accounts, you can just drag&drop your notes (or even contacts) from one group to another.
