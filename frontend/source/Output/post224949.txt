Is there a way to make offline content of 3rd party music apps on iPhone appear as iPod/Music? <body> I know this question is a long shot, but I'll try.   I just bought a new car that does not have CarPlay support - it was part of my consideration, but I couldn't base the purchase solely on that.   The car has has iPod integration via cable. That is, if I have music on my iPhone that was synced from iTunes, I am going to be able to switch albums directly via my car's audio system.  The catch is that I don't use iTunes at all. I've long ago switched to relying on Spotify and Google Music with their offline modes. As a result, I can easily switch tracks using the basic interface, but I cannot switch albums. Of course, if I go to the car's iPod menu, I am told that there is no content on my device.  So, my question is: Is there some straightforward way to somehow make 3rd party libraries mimic iPod to fool my car? If not, is there some way to sync music into my phone without going through a bunch of applications on my computer?
