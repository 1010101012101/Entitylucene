How do I reset to default window sizes in MacOS Safari's Responsive Design Mode? <body> I use MacOS Safari's Responsive Design Mode for web development (codeCommand-Option-R/code or code'Develop'/code  code'Enter Responsive Design Mode'/code in the menu.  I have "accidentally" changed the largest window size to a random size (should be 1920 x 1080) by adjusting the horizontal and vertical handles. I would like to reset to 1920 x 1080, but it is very difficult to do by adjusting the handles because of the responsiveness of the controls; it's hard to stop on a specific dimension. Unfortunately, that is the only way I can see to do it, as I can't find a reset control or option anywhere?  I have searched the menu options and the almighty Google and can't seem to find an answer? I suspect there is .plist I can remove? Could someone point me in the right direction?  Many thanks.  precodeMacOS 10.12.5 Safari 10.1.1 /code/pre  <answer288009> .This setting is written to Safari's preferences, that are located in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist/code in dictionary by codeResponsiveDesignCustomPresetConfigurations/code key. So if you need to reset all responsive mode settings - just close Safari and delete that dictionary from prefs .plist file with following terminal command:  precodedefaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist ResponsiveDesignCustomPresetConfigurations /code/pre  <comment363673> You are a god amongst men.
