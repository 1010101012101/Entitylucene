How do I use AirDrop from the Terminal? <body> Is there a way to share a file over AirDrop via Terminal on Mountain Lion? How so?  <answer62814> No - the functionality is programmed into the core OS and lacks official hooks supplied by Apple via the command line.  <answer64720> I have not (yet) figured out a way to strongsend/strong files via Airdrop using the Terminal, but you can set your computer to strongreceive/strong files via Airdrop using the following shell script:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript tell application "Finder"     activate     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "R" using {command down, shift down} end tell /code/pre  <answer264984> There is a tool on Github called strongterminal-share/strong that claims to offer this functionality:  precodeterminal-share -service airdrop -image path/to/image.jpg /code/pre  But it's not clear to me how you specify a destination..  <comment71946> In what way? To send or receive files? It's finder functionality so to be honest I doubt it, but there maybe some AppleScript hyjinx depending on what you are trying to do. <comment76050> I wish they would add that. Until then, `scp` will continue to be my friend. <comment76053> This would be really handy if you didn't need to accept each transfer. Perhaps that could be scripted as well.
