How do I turn off my iPod Touch? <body> I have been having trouble with the use of my iPod Touch.  When I go to turn it off, the voice command screen comes up.  <answer200660> Normally, to shut down an iPod touch:  ul liHold down the strongSleep/Wake/strong button on strongtop/strong of the device. em(NOT the Home button on the front.)/em emUse the manuals link below to find the manual for your device./em/li liThen "slide to power off" when prompted./li /ul  I suspect you may be holding down the strongHome/strong button, which invokes the Voice Command.  From Apple Support:     h3How to restart/h3      ul   liPress and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the red slider appears./li   liDrag the slider to turn your device completely off./li   liAfter the device turns off, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button again until you see the Apple logo./li   /ul   You can download manuals for iPod touch.  <answer200664> To turn the device off hold to "Power" button (Top of the device) until a slide to power off screen appears - Press it and slide your finger across the screen.  If this fails, try holding down the 'Home' button with the 'Power' button for 10 seconds, the device should be off now.   If not; Try this: Go to the Settings app, General, Tap Accessibility Then click AssistiveTouch (Near the bottom)  Now there should be a small black square that you can drag around your screen, Tap it, Tap Device then hold the Lock icon until prompted "Slide to power off"  <comment241763> Please separate these into two questions, as there will be two different answers. This makes it much easier for us to find and answer question, <comment241828> Which model is you iPod Touch?  Which version of iOS? <comment241910> @bjbk a 64gb iPod Touch and I got the latest update which I think is 6.0 or something. <comment241911> Okay then where is the power button? My ipod was gift,bought used. so no instructions. <comment241918> @Trismegistus at the top <comment242039> @Trismegistus You can [download manual for iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en_US/manuals/ipodtouch). <comment242040> Thank you @BasilBourque for the link.
