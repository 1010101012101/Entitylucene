Removing Items from Reading List <body> How do I remove items (individual or all) from Reading List on my iMac (OS X 10.6.8)?  <answer135236> I'm running OS 10.9.x right now, but I don't think it should be too different. When you open the reading list by clicking the little glasses (I think that's what it was- it may be under the same book icon as bookmarks), mouseover the item you want to delete, and you should see a tiny x in a circle appear in the top left of that item. Click to delete it.  <answer212924> sidebar for reading list, has a tiny x to remove that one itembr control-click it to get an option for delete allbr found on https://discussions.apple.com/message/24035730#24035730  <answer265256> Hold "control" down as you click on reading list item. In the menu that appears choose "delete". You can delete more than one item using "shift" or "command" keys.  <answer265611> hold control key, click on item, select remove. that works now after update  <comment160405> Thanks AgentRF. That used to work but no more. My reading list has gotten huge & I’d finally decided to clear all the items, but that too won’t respond. <comment160457> So your question was more along the lines of mass-deletion, not one-by-one?
