How can I copy and paste multiple texts? <body> I would like to copy several different texts/things at the same time and paste them in any order.  Does anyone know any good Mac OS X software or plugin that can handle multiple copy/paste?   <answer15871> Check this: http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/  Cited from the above:     Jumpcut is an application that provides "clipboard buffering" â€” that   is, access to text that you've cut or copied, even if you've   subsequently cut or copied something else. The goal of Jumpcut's   interface is to provide quick, natural, intuitive access to your   clipboard's history.   <answer15889> Several app launchers also have clipboard history functionality built-in. I personally use LaunchBar, which supports clipboard history for up to 40 items. I previously used Quicksilver before development ceased - though I understand it's now back in development.  <answer15900> may I add Butler to the lot, http://manytricks.com/butler/  does many more things in fact, but indeed does the multiclip well...  <answer28980> I wrote CmdVees to scratch my own itch. It solves my specific problem with copy/paste. It may fit your needs.  <answer28987> I use ClipMenu to handle multiple clipboards. It's nice, has lots of features and it's free.  See also this question: Good simple Clipboard manager  <answer156957> I wrote this one (no installer, just source): http://github.com/sje397/Clint  Very simple, but quite hackable and works on all platforms supported by Qt and you can network it so that you can share the clipboard across multiple computers.  <comment17258> +10 if I could. First thing I install on any new system. Once you start using it you won't be able to live without it. <comment17260> only beware with a security, for example when you copy&paste  your super-secret-password to the dating server - your wife can one click-discover it while you're going for the next beer :) <comment17261> OK, I'll only give you only +9 on that basis. But yeh - be careful with your copypasta folks. <comment17277> +1 for LaunchBar. Clipboard management plus so much more. <comment33300> yes, the development of Quicksilver is active again and shortly there has been released a new version vor OS X 10.6 and 10.7: http://qsapp.com/ <comment33304> This should be a [community wiki](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts). Flagged for mod attention. <comment35443> Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. <comment184567> Tell us more about it and how is it better than other solutions?
