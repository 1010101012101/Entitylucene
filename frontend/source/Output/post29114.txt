Can't switch theme in MacVim <body> I recently installed MacVim along with Janus. When I'm inside macVim I can change my color scheme with code:color freya/code but if i restart MacVim the them is reverted back to ir_black. I've added freya to my .vimrc.local, but it doesn't help.  Also added the following: codeset term=xterm-256color/code   I'm using Lion and I've got a bunch of themes in ~/.vim/colors  <answer29133> MacVim is a graphical version of Vim, so it can have a graphical config file (code.gvimrc/code) as well as the regular code.vimrc/code.  Have you tried putting your color setting in code.gvimrc/code, or seen whether it has a conflicting setting?  <answer29156> Are you sourcing your code.vimrc.local/code by hand? That is not a standard file. MacVIM will read your code~/.vimrc/code and code~/.gvimrc/code. I'd suggest you keep your syntax settings in code.gvimrc/code for MacVIM unless you want to use them in your terminal as well.  If you want to keep a generic code.gvimrc/code that is shared by multiple systems and set your color only for this machine in code.gvimrc.local/code you can put the following at the end of your code~/.gvimrc/code  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code" Allow for local machine-specific modifications if filereadable($HOME . "/.gvimrc.local")   source ~/.gvimrc.local endif  /code/pre  <answer29205> GUI-based instances of Vim source code.vimrc/code and then code.gvimrc/code, so anything in the latter can potentially override anything in the former.  The Janus code.vimrc/code does a codecolor desert/code and its code.gvimrc/code does a codecolor ir_black/code.  Since code.vimrc.local/code is sourced by Janus’s code.vimrc/code as a final step, its settings can be (in this case, are being) overridden by Janus’s code.gvimrc/code.  To override the codecolor ir_black/code from Janus’s code.gvimrc/code, you need to put your codecolor freya/code in your code.gvimrc.local/code (which Janus’s code.gvimrc/code sources as a final step—if it exists and is readable).  <comment33541> Sigh. The `*.local` is due to [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus). The typical Janus installation takes over a user’s `.vimrc`, `.gvimrc`, `.vim/`, and then expects users to put their customizations in `*.local` variant files. Ick. <comment39375> I also had this problem - thanks for the clear explanation.
