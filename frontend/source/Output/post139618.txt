Can I control how Preview decides to group documents when opening them all at once? <body> I use Preview frequently for the task of combining multiple PDFs. Typically, these PDFs are all created within a few minutes of one another, and when opening from the Finder, they all open in the same window, making it very easy to export a new PDF that includes all of the individual documents.  However, I have noticed that if I add a PDF to this group of individual documents the next day, select them all, and open from the Finder, the the latest-added document will open in its own window while the rest open all in the same window.  I know how to move the separate one into the other group, but I'm wondering if I can control how they are opened from the beginning.  <comment164626> A little while (30m-1h) after submitting this question, the documents including the new one started opening all in one group.
