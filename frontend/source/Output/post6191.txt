How can I set an external display (monitor) as the primary one? <body> Currently the MacBook's display works as emprimary/em, so every application I open gets open on the 13" and I have to drag it to the 24". I also don't have access to the dock on my 24".  Is is possible to turn off the MacBook screen and use only the one attached via DVI?  (I've just connected my 24" HP LP2475w via Mini DisplayPort to DVI to my MacBook Pro 13", which works great except for this one thing.)  <answer6192> Under your strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongDisplay/strong, you've got this img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHYgX.png" alt="alt text"  Just drag the strongwhite bar/strong to the other screen to set it as the main screen.  You might have to do that every time you reboot / reconnect the external screen.  <answer6204> MBP 13" Oct 2010 Plug in external monitor and close the mbp's lid  <answer6207> Loïc answered for the main monitor question. For closing the lid of your MacBook, it's what is called to use it in clamshell mode.  As you will have to have an external mouse and keyboard connected to your laptop, you have to boot, close your lid (your mac will turn to sleep) and then use your mouse or keyboard to wake it from sleep mode.  If you have a bluetooth mouse and/or keyboard, you have to go in the bluetooth prefpane, and, in Advanced settings, check the codeAllow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer/code.  By the way, in this situation, no need anymore for a main and secondary monitor :)  When you open your lid while using only the external monitor, the macbook screen will stay black. If you want to use again both screens, you have to go to the Displays prefpane and click on codeDetect displays/code. Or, like me, check the codeShow displays in menu bar/codeand use the menubar instead to detect the displays.  <answer6266> Related;  Secondbar adds a second menu bar http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33264/secondbar  <answer83793> Want o work on your external monitor while mac latop lid is closed? Plug your laptop your charger and close the lid and it will not sleep. Thats the trick  <answer224592> While running a dual-display setup, you can easily adjust the primary display monitor in Mac OS X. Before beginning, have both displays turned on, and the external display already connected to the Mac:  ol liGo to System Preferences - Displays/li liChoose the ‘Arrangement’ tab/li liClick and hold on the white bar at the top of the current primary display/li liDrag the white bar across to the other monitor you want to set as the new primary display/li liAfter you release the white bar, both screens will flicker briefly and adjust to accommodate new settings/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/45AEM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Whatever monitor is set as primary it will become the default display for applications launching, in addition to holding the system menubar, containing all the default desktop icons and the Dock.  Note that if the secondary display will be detached, the primary screen will revert back to a built-in display on any portable Mac.  Here is the link to the original post about it.  <comment6466> After a few search, it might be a duplicate. I'll let the mod decide. http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/3697 <comment6467> Works great, thanks. Is there any way I can turn off the MacBook screen off? I have connected my Magic Mouse and external keyboard, but when I close the lid, it just puts the system to sleep. <comment6468> @Darth Did you try to set the luminosity of the screen to a minimum? It doesn't affect the external screen and the lowest setting is pretty much black. <comment6470> That works great, as the lowest luminosity turns the screen off. The only problem I see now is that it seems a little laggy, not sure if that's normal or because the laptop screen is still on. <comment6471> @Darth what seems laggy? The whole computer? It didn't happened when the main screen was the macbook? <comment6474> Not a dupe IMO. <comment6475> I suggest breaking this up into two questions, as you can tell you're having to repeat one in the comments to an answer below... <comment29522> @Darth it doesn't actually turn the screen off. Try decreasing the luminosity and then expose the screen to bright light with something on it, like a window or a webpage. You can still see the contents of the screen, it's just the backlight that is off. <comment70188> @LoïcWolff Nope. Not a dup, as the question here is about the default position of an application. <comment93008> You can also install an application called caffeine which you can turn on or off. Once turned on you can close the lid and it will not go into sleep mode. <comment96440> This is not what the OP is asking about. There is another question on here about what you described. However, keep in mind that it is the Display Out that needs to be plugged in, not the power cord. <comment185740> FYI this solution doesn't seem to work in Yosemite. <comment272392> it's usually a good idea to put solution here AND provide a link to where you've found it. We do this because linked pages can get expired or deleted. <comment272394> @ranklord, good point, I just update my answer. <comment272436> I'm a bit confused as to why you answer a 5 year old question which already has an accepted answer, with the same solution as yours, and 34 votes.
