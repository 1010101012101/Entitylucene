When locking screen on OS X Chrome cancels downloads <body> When I lock my screen using kbdcmd/kbdkbdalt/kbdkbdeject/kbd while Chrome is downloading, the download is canceled. I get back to my computer and see that download is not active. I also noticed that video streams I'm watching (such as live TV) also stop.  My question is, can I change this behaviour? When the download is big I cannot lock my computer for long time and I feel my computer is compromised when I leave it.  Is it OS X issue or Chrome?  I have MacBook Pro (13 inch, mid 2012) with El Capitan.  <answer243912> Instead of kbdcmd/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdeject/kbd, use the strongLogin Window/strong instead as this does not interrupt your download or streaming.  To use strongLogin Window/strong, go to:  emSystem Preferences - Users  Login Options  Show fast user switching menu as 'Icon'/em  You will see a "user icon" top right bar left of Spotlight icon. Click on this then click on strongLogin Window/strong.  Hope this helps, if it doesn't, it is most probably that your drive is encrypted. Check emSystem Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  FileVault/em.  <comment300434> Thank you for your comment. Sorry for the bad phrasing.. :-(. I edited the question, hopefully it is clearer now. Thanks! <comment300447> Thanks @emotality! It works well. Not as comfortable as a key shortcut. Is there a way to attach keyboard shortcut to Login Window? I'll look at the System Preferences. <comment300449> My pleasure! You can try out with Automator for making your own scripts then add a keyboard shortcut to this service. But I mean, 2 clicks is kind of faster than looking at your keyboard to press 3 buttons at the same time hehe :P
