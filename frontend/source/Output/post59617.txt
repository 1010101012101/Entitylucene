Is there any Mac Application used for part-zooming a picture? <body> I found many screenshots for Mac App Store or iTunes App Store using pictures like this, I want to find a Mac App can do this work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwhaK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer59623> It's called a Loupe tool.  You'll find it in a lot of different image editing programs.  Both Photoshop and Aperture have Loupe tools built in.  <answer59627> This feature is built in ML 10.8 with the accessibility feature zoom. Go to system preferences Accessibility, select zoom the last feature is zoom style select picture-in-picture. This will be a rectangle and follows your mouse any where on screen. You can use option command = (to enlarge) or - (to decrees) the text under the magnifying rectangle, if you have a keyboard with num pad you can use option command + or - for the same effect.  <comment68716> Aren't those just for viewing the image, though?
