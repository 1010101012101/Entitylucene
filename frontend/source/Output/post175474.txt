How do I retrieve photos from an iphone backup? <body> I have an iphone backup with screenshots I'd like to extract. They aren't on icloud/iphoto.  Is it possible to retrieve them? I no longer have the phone.  Thanks.  <answer175475> Software like PhoneView is able to extract information from backup files. There might be free alternatives, PhoneView is just the one I am familiar with.  <answer193786> You could also try picturescue: http://picturescueapp.com/, which is a bit cheaper and works well.   OR you can just restore your backup to a friend's iphone or a new iphone if you have one. (But if you use a friend's make sure you back it up first)
