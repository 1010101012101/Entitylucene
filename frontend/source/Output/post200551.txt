Prevent Finder to launch on boot <body> I do not need Finder because I use Ranger in CLI and I manually quit it (I added the quit option) each time I boot (mainly not to have it in the way when I use to switch applications with cmd + tab).  If it's not possible, an alternative would be to quit it from the terminal and I would do a script that is launched on boot. But after "killall Finder", Finder relaunch automatically.  <answer200555> Just disable the LaunchAgent com.apple.finder at /System/Library/LaunchAgents/  with codesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist/code and Finder shouldn't launch at all.  Depending on your system this might not be successful. Then download, install and open LaunchControl. Navigate to System Agents - com.apple.Finder and highlight it. In the menubar choose Job - Unload. Then hit the radio button next to com.apple.Finder and disable it.  <answer200556> You can change the automatically launched program via this command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.loginwindow Finder /PATH/TO/ALTERNATIVE.app /code/pre  The alternative program will launch instead of Finder; and the force-quit option will change to "restart", etc.   The actual Finder can still be started, but it can also be quit, just as any other normal app.   <comment241651> This the response I get : `/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist: Could not find specified service` <comment241659> It works like a charm with LaunchControl !
