Wipe iphone, switch carriers, get new carrier-locked iphone, restore? <body> Let's say I have an AT&amp;T iphone 5. I regularly back it up with itunes.br I decide to switch carriers to Verizon. I wipe my iphone, sell it, and get a brand new Verizon iphone 5.  Can I simply plug that iphone into itunes, do a restore from backup, and have everything exactly as it was before? Or is there enough of a difference between the carrier-locked phones that this would not smoothly restore?  <answer87406> strongYou will be able to/strong restore the backup, especially if your old device wasn't jailbroken (if it is, some space might end up wasted due to the unofficial apps' preferences &amp; files).  Even if you look to already expect this, remember the unlock won't carry over.  <comment102133> No jailbreak, no unlock. Just a stock iphone running stock iOS. Thanks.
