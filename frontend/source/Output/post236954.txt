How to fill down in Numbers without dragging? <body> I have a 20,000 line spreadsheet in Apple Numbers, and I need to fill a column with data. I don't want to sit there dragging down the fill handle for thousands of rows.   How can I fill the whole column with a value?   <answer237119> Found a way.   ol liSelect the column /li liDeselect the header row (Cmd click on the header row cell)/li liTable Menu  Autofill Cells  Autofill Down/li /ol  This will ​not​ infer a pattern. (ex 1,2,3 it will just copy down 1,1,1)  If you’re expect it to interpolate, you have to click-drag.  It will fill down formulas and they will be correct.   <comment290083> Fill it with data meaning: a) Copy the data from the top cell to all cells b) Fill and increment the value? <comment290302> Either. If the column should be 'True' copy that down into all 20,000 cells. If it should be 1,2,3 incrementing copy those 3 numbers and fill down incrementing.
