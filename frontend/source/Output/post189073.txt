Macbook Pro Sound doesn't work after Yosemite update <body> It has been more than a couple of months I have been looking for solution and I haven't found any yet. Here's my problem:  ol listartup sound works/li lino 'internal speaker' in 'output device' in sound setting./li liAudio midi setup has master volume set to 0. Cannot change the value./li /ol  This all happened after Yosemite update.  I have tried following so far  ol liPRAM reset/li lisudo killall coreaudiod/li liplug in headphone and plug out (slowly, quickly and at every speed possible)/li lire-installing Yosemite/li /ol  and other few I don't remember.  I am now tired of looking for solution. I hope somebody here will be a god to me.  Thanks in advance. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lrlxY.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a0z5d.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment224265> Your second screenshot says "Digital Out".  Is there a light shining inside your headphone port?  In which case, the port is stuck in digital out mode (which I believe has no volume control). <comment224315> @Ashley nope, there ain't any light shining inside headphone port. Select sound output device has only one option "digital out" while "internal speaker" used to be there too. <comment289369> I have the same problem! Did you solve it?
