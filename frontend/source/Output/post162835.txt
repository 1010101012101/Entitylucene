Will upgrading to Yosemite remove all my tweaks and setting? <body> I've made many small tweaks and preference customization to the Mavericks install on my Mac. If I upgrade to Yosemite, will those tweaks and preferences be reset and would require me to re-apply them?  <answer162836> In general, no. Most of your settings will remain intact, but some of them may be reset or irrelevant in Yosemite.   <answer162855> I upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite several months ago, and didn't notice any differences with OS preferences.  They should stay the same. However some application specific preferences may change, but I would guess that for most standard apps, like Mail, your preferences would remain intact.  But it would help if you were more specific about what kind of preferences.    <comment190472> Can you give us examples of Your "tweaks"? Are You storing anything inside `/System` dir?
