Use clamshell mode without power adapter <body> One of the requirements to use clamshell mode is to have the power adapter plugged in.  Is their any file modification or app that will work around this?  Like to switch throughout the day from a sit down desk to stand up and bringing the power adapter back and forth, is becoming more of a hassle.  <answer165024> You can use Insomniax to disable sleep when the display is closed. This will mean that you can close the lid and display the screen on a secondary monitor mode without needing to have a power adapter connected as the Mac will not sleep when you close the lid.  <comment193562> Works perfectly. <comment357971> Works perfectly for me. Thanks. <comment369789> Clamshell works for me with or without power adapter... running 10.11.6 El Capitan <comment369790> Welcome to Ask Different! This does not answer the question; stating that Clamshell mode works with/without power adapter does not help answer the question. Perhaps you could include the settings you have made, or anything that affects this outcome? <comment369791> I didn't change anything at all, was just trying to say it works out of the box as intended for me...only reason I brought up clamshell with/without adapter is because that's what the title of the thread is; also mentioned in first post <comment369792> Per the [Apple support link the OP provided](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834), Mac laptops _must_ be plugged in in order for "closed-display" or clamshell mode to work. The fact that you are stating it works differently means it is actually _not_ working as intended on your computer. <comment369793> Oh well, I've never had any problems with it, this is something I use daily; thought it worked that way for everybody <comment369794> Maybe it's because I hook up with both USB keyboard and mouse & effectively use my laptop as a desktop?http://osxdaily.com/2010/04/15/how-to-use-a-macbook-or-macbook-pro-with-the-lid-closed-and-hooked-to-an-external-monitor/ <comment369795> Closing the lid works for me... for about 30 seconds. Then it sleeps. The InsomniaX solution posted by @grgarside works for me. (Sierra 10.12.1.)
