Can I export my signature from Preview on one Mac and import it on another? <body> A follow on to this question about extracting the signature image. Is it possible to just copy the plist file containing the signature from one Mac to another? Is there a recommended method for exporting and import signatures from one Mac to another I should follow instead?  I could "sign" a blank PDF and take a screen shot of it but but I really want the same password to go along with the image so it's 100% the same signature on the other Mac as the one I'm using on this Mac.  <answer75516> This was covered by Aussie Bloke's blog when Lion arrived. Here are the steps to get both the file where the signature is stored as well as the associated keychain entry to a second Mac.  h2On the source Mac:/h2  ul liOpen the code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/code folder.  ul liIn strongFinder/strong, click the strongGo/strong menu and hold kbdoption/kbd to show the strongLibrary/strong folder./li liAlternatively, press ⇧⌘G whilst Finder is active and enter the path above to directly navigate./li /ul/li liOn OS X strongMavericks 10.9/strong and strongearlier/strong, copy the codecom.apple.Preview.signatures.plist/code file./li liOn OS X strongYosemite 10.10/strong and stronglater/strong, copy the codecom.apple.PreviewLegacySignaturesConversion.plist/code file./li liLaunch strongKeychain Access/strong/li liEnsure the stronglogin/strong keychain is selected and choose the strongPasswords/strong category./li liOn OS X strongMavericks 10.9/strong and strongearlier/strong, right-click the strongPreview Signature Privacy/strong password and select emCopy Password to Clipboard/em.

This is necessary when the target machine (like a Mac Pro with an older or third-party display attached) has no camera which means no Signature file can be created from within Preview. Open strongKeychain Access/strong as above and do the following:/em  ul liClick on the + icon to create a new entry/li liOn OS X strongMavericks 10.9/strong and strongearlier/strong, enter strongPreview Signature Privacy/strong in the emKeychain Item Name/em field./li liOn OS X strongYosemite 10.10/strong and stronglater/strong, enter strongSignature Annotation Privacy/strong in the emKeychain Item Name/em field./li liEnter strongPreview/strong in the emAccount Name/em field./li liPaste the password copied from your original machine, per above procedure./li liClick strongAdd/strong/li liIn the newly created entry, click strongAccess Control/strong/li liAdd strongPreview/strong to applications allowed access/li liClick strongSave Changes/strong and you're done!/li /ul  <answer222381> If your source Mac is portable (i.e. a laptop) then one crude but effective option I have just performed is to do the following:  On the source Mac:  ol liOpen a new TextEdit document and go to File  Print/li liIn the PDF dropdown menu select to open PDF in Preview. This will open your blank TextEdit document in Preview/li liResize the blank Preview window to fill the screen/li liInsert your signature in the usual way Tools  Annotate  Signature and resize to be as large as possible/li /ol  On the destination Mac:  ol liIn Preview go to Tools  Annotate  Signature  Manage Signatures/li liUse the Camera option to make a new signature/li liPresent (i.e. lift it up and show it) your source Mac to the camera on the destination Mac and this will detect the signature and store it/li /ol  I realise this is similar to scribbling on a sheet of paper and making a new signature in the destination Mac but if this is not to hand then this method has worked for me today. Hope it helps others.  <answer242912> To accomplish the transfer of a signature from one machine to another on OS X strongYosemite/strong, strongEl Capitan/strong and onwards:  strong1./strong  Follow the original answer but make the following alterations:  strong2./strong  The file: codecom.apple.Preview.signatures.plist/code does not exist.br Instead, copy: codecom.apple.PreviewLegacySignaturesConversion.plist/code.  strong3./strong  The Keychain Access entry: strongPreview Signature Privacy/strong does not exist.br Instead, use: strongSignature Annotation Privacy/strong.  <comment143939> I’m on OS X Mavericks, and when I try to copy the password, I get the following error: **Access to this item is restricted.** (-25320). Has anyone found a workaround for this? <comment143945> False alarm. Some combination of Keychain First Aid, Repair Disk Permissions, and restarting has fixed the problem. <comment221010> Doesn't seem to work for Yosemite. Apparently it now encodes the signature as a base64 string and keeps it in the password field of a different password entry. <comment242788> In Yosemite, the `com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist` file is not in the `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences` folder. <comment242789> For Yosemite, view: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155149/importing-exporting-preview-signatures-on-os-x-10-10-yosemite <comment298960> Maybe make this an edit on the already well-formed and accepted answer? So there's only one, canonical answer? <comment299262> I did update the original answer at the same time I left this answer.  However, it seems the original answer has been reverted back to before my changes were made.  I will attempt to edit it a second time. <comment299270> It seems my edit to the original answer is still under peer review, hence the delay in its update. <comment299271> Reviewed and approved. Thank you! <comment343500> I've got the com.apple.PreviewLegacySignaturesConversion.plist and the Keychain password from the source mac. On the destination mac (Mac Pro running Sierra) I've created the new entry in Keychain Access with the password from the source mac. In the Preview Preferences menu there is only a General tab, Images tab, and PDF tab. No Signatures tab. Is there a way I can get Preview to recognize the new Keychain password item and the new plist in Library/Containers/.../Preferences that it should use? All I get is "A trackpad or iSight camera is required to create a signature." Thanks! <comment365055> com.apple.PreviewLegacySignaturesConversion.plist doesn't seem to exist in Sierra.
