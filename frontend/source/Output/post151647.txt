Connecting a 2007 Mac Mini to a Samsung Tv <body> I have a mid 2007 Mac Mini that I bought to hook up to a tv and use for Netflix, tv, etc.   When I connect to the tv it shows a codemode not supported/code message.    I followed the instructions on the web and I can remotely log in when it's connected, and it is running at 60Hz and I tried most of the resolutions all to no avail.   Has anybody had success connecting these two devices?   <answer151920> I solved it.  After setting up a remote connection, I went through the video settings and it turns out the only resolution supported was 720p.  It was, by default, using something else that didn't work.    <comment178468> Connection type and any adapter being used? <comment178730> It's connected at the tv with an hdmi and at the mac mini with a dvi.
