How to disable moving a window by its edge adjacent to scroll bar? <body> In Mac OS X Yosemite, I find that the scroll bar is a small target for the mouse, and sometimes when I wish to scroll, I end up moving the whole window by grabbing its edge to the right of the scroll bar.  This is never the behavior I desire.  How can I disable the ability to move a window by grabbing anything other than its title bar?  <answer215192> I try scrolling with scroll bar because there is a scroll bar. Sometimes it's better than scrolling with mouse. (smooth scrolling)  To change, go to System Preferences: General settings - Show scroll bars - Always  <comment216131> Why are you trying to grab the scroll bar as it shouldn't be necessary as long as the mouse is over any scrollable area of a window it should just scroll with a scrolling motion. <comment216132> @user3439894 I have those gestures turned off due to their being inadvertently invoked too often, so I need to grab the thumb to scroll the window. <comment260028> This doesn't appear to answer the question. <comment331921> Any luck? I have the same issue. <comment332443> @dvallejo Nope, I still face this issue, almost two years later.
