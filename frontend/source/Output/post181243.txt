Changing iterm2 Terminal Color <body> Is there a way to bold the color of the current active terminal tab in iterm2? I do not see an option to do that on the appearance tab of preferences. I know I can change the tab style, but I still want a really bold appearance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CMoxV.png" alt="active terminal tab"  From the above picture, I want the middle tab to be of a bold color (orange or some other bright colors) when it is active.  <answer239832> iTerm2 build 2.1.4 on OS X 10.11.4 has that capability built in:  View  Tab Colour:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXe87.png" alt="View&gt;Tab Colour menu"  Clicking one of the colours has the following result (Inactive): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3IQ6c.png" alt="inactive iTerm2 tab"  (Active) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yiKt5.png" alt="active iTerm2 tab"
