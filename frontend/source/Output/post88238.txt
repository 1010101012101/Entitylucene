How do I setup Apple Mail to automatically move old email to the Archive folder? <body> I want Apple Mail to automatically move all email, read and unread, to the Archive folder IF it's past a certain date. I want this move to take effect on ALL my devices (mac,iPad,iPhone,etc). How can I set this up? Can I set this up from the iPad or only on the Mac?  <answer88243> "I have a me.com email address." queued me in that you are probably on IMAP. Simply put IMAP syncs your mail across all your devices, instead of having to delete a particular email three different places.  So, to do what you desire, you will have to create a rule on your Mac:  ol liOpen Mail Settings and go to "Rules"./li liClick "Add Rule" and type in your description./li liCreate the Logic: ul liDate Received :: Is Greater Than :: [Arbitrary Number Chosen by You]/li /ul/li liUnder perform the following actions: ul liMove Message :: emto mailbox/em :: "Archive" - "iCloud"/li /ul/li liClick "OK", then "Apply"./li liThe changes should be reflected on your iPad and iPhone counter-parts after refreshing inboxes there./li /ol  <comment103261> This should be easily possible as long as the date is static. Do you, by any chance, use an IMAP email setup or some other type? <comment103263> @bassplayer7 I honestly don't know. I use apple mail...I have a me.com email address. Can you describe what you mean by `IMAP email setup`?
