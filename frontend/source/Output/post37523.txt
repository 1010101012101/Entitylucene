Order of parameters for command-line tools <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can command-line commands be made insensitive to order of filenames and options?       It looks like the OS X built-in command line tools, such as ls, du etc are rather strict with regards to the order of parameters.  To illustrate, a command for showing disk usage, 'du', accepts -h as a 'human readable' formatting directive for sizes. If you run the following under OS X Lion, this parameter is ignored:  precodedu . -h /code/pre  To get it to work, you need to specify the parameter fist, then the location, like that:  precodedu -h . /code/pre  Coming from Linux (ubuntu) background this seems strange to me - under Ubuntu you can do it either way. This is also becomes quite annoying at times, especially when you realise that you've forgotten to specify a parameter for long command and have to move the cursor to the beginning of it.  Hence is the question: can I change the 'default' behavior of command line tools to be more forgiving? Also, what's the reason for that restriction? A BSD legacy?  <answer37533> I believe that handling of the parameter order is compiled into the executable. This would mean you'd have to modify the source code of the program(s) to change this behavior.  <comment42579> Its the BSD way ! Its a really big problem when people shift from *nix to Mac <comment42602> Related: [Can command-line commands be made insensitive to order of filenames and options?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/19284/3349) <comment42680> That is interesting.  I came from a Fedora background and have always put the options/flags before the operands.  I thought that was standard!  Learn something new everyday...
