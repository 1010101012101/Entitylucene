Populate Pages Chart Data via Applescript <body> Right now I'm copy and pasting between Excel and specified places in a Pages document. For instance, I'll copy cell B7 and find "B7_Value" in Pages and replace it with the copied value. Here's an example of what I'm working with so far:  precodetell application "Microsoft Excel" tell active workbook     activate object worksheet "Page 1"     set var_B7 to string value of range "B7" of active sheet         end tell end tell  set var_B7 to replaceText(var_visits, " ", "")  tell application "Pages" activate tell application "System Events"      delay 0.5      keystroke "f" using command down     set the clipboard to "B7_Value"     keystroke "v" using command down     delay 0.2     keystroke tab     delay 0.2     set the clipboard to var_B7     keystroke "v" using command down     delay 0.2     keystroke tab     delay 0.2     keystroke space     delay 0.2     key code 53 -- escape     delay 0.5  end tell end tell  on replaceText(theString, fString, rString)     set current_Delimiters to text item delimiters of AppleScript     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to fString     set sList to every text item of theString     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to rString     set newString to sList as string     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to current_Delimiters     return newString end replaceText /code/pre  Now, I need to expand this to copy a range of cells and populate chart data in Pages. Any help is very much appreciated.
