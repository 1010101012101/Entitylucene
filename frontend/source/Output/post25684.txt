Can't shift+select in Finder in Lion 10.7.1 <body> In previous versions of Mac OS X, to select a whole row of files, you select the file which comes first in the row and then select the last file with a shift+click.  When I try this procedure strongin icon view/strong in Lion, it behaves as if I would select the files separately.  What changed? Is there a way to restore the old behavior?  <answer30267> Problem solved: Seems to be a feature when you try to shift+select files in icon view  <comment29138> In the Finder? Do you have a special shortcut configuration? Special customization? I cannot reproduce the problem in Lion. <comment29176> Did you change the default assignment of the special keys (Shift/Control etc.), see Preferences → Settings → Keyboard to check. <comment29207> Do you mean on the desktop, or in a window? For me, it selects all between in a window, but only the items I click on the desktop. <comment29535> For reproduction try to view items in icon view and then shift+select them, it won't work. The only walk around is to use an other view than icon view. Is this a bug or a feature? ;) <comment32692> Ah, in icon view I have the same behaviour (in 10.7.2 as well). Seems to be a feature.
