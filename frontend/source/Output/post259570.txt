Delete form Reading List <body> I want to delete an item from the Reading List on my MacBook Pro. There is no "X" in upper left hand corner. How do I delete item from list?  <comment324765> Have a look at: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/257889/removing-items-from-reading-list-in-os-x-safari <comment324794> @patrix The user is not specifically asking to clear *all* items. As user3439894 linked to, that question is a much better duplicate candidate.
