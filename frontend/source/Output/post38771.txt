Change Network location from terminal <body> I have a two locations set up on my macBook. One for normal use and another for when I use a proxy, which I start from the command line.  It would be very useful for me to be able to switch network location from the command line at the same time.  Is this possible?   <answer38773> Yep, pretty easy too.  You may need to 'sudo' the command depending on your system's configuration.  precodenetworksetup -switchtolocation "location name" /code/pre  There are some other options, too:  precodenetworksetup -getcurrentlocation networksetup -listlocations networksetup -createlocation &lt;location name&gt; [populate] networksetup -deletelocation &lt;location name&gt; networksetup -switchtolocation &lt;location name&gt; /code/pre  <comment120109> I was about to ask this question, when I see it was already asked. This is my exact same situation. My name is also Joe. Are you future-me come back to help now-me? <comment120678> @JShoe I can't tell you that. But you should definately avoid anyone with a tatoo of a goldfish. <comment325417> Is there a way to set this via a config file?
