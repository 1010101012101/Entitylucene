Macbook 10.9.5 Firefox freeze <body> After updating OS X on my Macbook 2011 to 10.9.5 I've started facing Firefox (32.0.3) freezing for a minute when macbook is resumed from suspend. Does anyone have thoughts, where to look for a cause of that? As far as I know, no other software is affected.  <answer147293> As you probably well know FF had a rough road recently.  Starting with FF 32.0.0 they got up to 32.0.1, 32.0.2 and 32.0.3 in one week while trying to solve a problem that  shows up as heavy CPU loading and sluggish behavior.  They are still working on resolving the issues with last release.  Best you can do is disable all add-on and extensions to test if it gets better.  FYI:  Here is my Console log with FF 32.0.3 Start UP.  precodekernel[0]: firefox (map: 0xffffff80384f42d0) triggered DYLD shared region unnest for map: 0xffffff80384f42d0, region 0x7fff8cc00000-&gt;0x7fff8ce00000.
