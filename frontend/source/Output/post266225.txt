iPhone 6s no power and error 9 <body> I have an iPhone 6s which does not turn on and display remains always black. When it is connected to iTunes, the phone is recognised by iTunes and restore fails with error 9, while the screen remains irresponsive.  I am not sure yet, whether the display is working or not. I checked the connections and it seems that there is no damage from outside or in inside cables. Apple relates error 9 to cable-connection problem but I saw that it may also be related to tristar and I guess u4500 chip for iPhone 6s.   ul liIs there any other hardware problem causing this error? /li liHow should troubleshooting look like? /li liIs there any possibility of the involvement of the dock connector to this problem?/li /ul  <comment333836> Was the phone dropped (or damaged in any other way)? Did you try with another cable? What happens if you plug it into a charger directly (without a computer)? <comment333837> @patrix The first owner of the phone told me about water damage. I checked two white stripes near the sim card hole and on the mainboard and both are white. I was able to see a little corrosion/rust (orange color) inside the lighting cable connetor. I cleaned the dock connector with alcohol and later with a cleaner. If I plug it into a wall charger, nothing happens. Black screen. Home button+powerbutton 10 sec. or just power button. Unfortunately, no response. <comment333838> Get a technician to have a look, the damage was probably greater than visible from the outside. <comment333839> @patrix I will do that by my own but before that, I need to know if some others had similar experiences. I dont wanna remove the shields on the motherboard before I am sure that there is a problem on the mainboard. If there are some people with similar experiences saying that it is definitely a problem on the mainboard, then I will just open it.
