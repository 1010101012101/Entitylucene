Sync iCloud TV show purchases between AppleTV and iTunes <body> strongHow do I sync AppleTV purchases from iCloud to iTunes?/strong  I recently purchased the most recent episode of Psych on my Apple TV but am unable to transfer it to iTunes.  I was able to do this with a previous episode but can't recall how.  I've tried going to codeStore &gt; Check for Available Downloads.../code but it says I don't have anything to download:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ivjIN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am using the same Apple Store account between the Apple TV and iTunes.  <answer31008> Go to the iTunes store homepage and click "Purchased" in the Quick Links section. This will bring you to a list of all content that is available for redownload for your account.
