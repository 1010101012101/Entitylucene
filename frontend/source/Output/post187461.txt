Imported Aperture library into Photos, "Show Referenced File in Finder" does nothing <body> I just finished importing my Aperture library into Photos using the official import process. My Aperture library used referenced masters on an external drive, and I had my external drive connected during the import process.   With my external drive still connected, nothing happens when I two-finger click on a thumbnail and choose "Show Referenced File in Finder." Any ideas?  <answer199854> I had a similar issue, which seemed like it had something to do with access permissions. Try the following:  ol liPick a random photo for which "Show Referenced File in Finder" does nothing./li liSelect it and hit space to view it./li liPhotos will pop up a dialog saying that it can't access some files outside the Photos library and will ask you to select a certain folder (for me it was the root of all my referenced files)./li /ol  After I'd done that, "Show Referenced File in Finder" now works for all my images.  <comment221626> see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/184578/open-location-of-a-photo-in-finder-from-photos-app inc answers & comments
