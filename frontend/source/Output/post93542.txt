can't install xcode, issue with MobileDevice.pkg <body> I am trying to install xcode on my mac version : Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 But I'm having a problem,  i download xcode version 4.6.2 from Appstore after i installed the app i clicked on the icon in the launchpad and it just opened and ask me to install device support so i click install and it ask for my password so i entered the pass and it wrote:  An unknown error occurred. See the install log for more details.  so i looked for this problem and i found that i can go to xcode icon, click on the option and click on "Show Package Contents" and than on Contents-Resources-Packages than i click "MobileDevice.pkg", again i entered my password and nothing happend like really nothing, the password is right and i dont know why it is like that  thank you for your help ilan.  <answer96750> I came across this issue in another post but not certain if the errors you are getting are the same but here it is.
