"Buy me a coffee" as in-app purchase? <body> Does Apple tolerate a "buy me a coffee" feature as In-App purchase ?   <answer158548> strongYes./strong This kind of 'donation' IAP is fine and approved by Apple.  For an example of an app which uses this, see Pedometer++ (an app promoted by Apple on numerous occasions) which uses three donation IAPs of different values to allow users more control over the quantity of their donation—also allowed.                                   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Ppxi.png" width="320"  <comment186412> Nice, both Q & A. Something I'd never heard of before; increased my knowledge. Equivalent of 'donationware' in the old-style shareware world, I'm assuming. <comment186413> Yup, that's exactly that :) <comment186421> Note that you're required to provide *some* kind of additional functionality in exchange for the "donation" <comment186445> @Undo What's your source for that? grgarside's answer looks to me to say that you *don't* need to give any other functionality. If that's not true, I'd upvote an answer saying what you said with a good source. <comment186446> @Kevin A few years ago there was some drama about flattr's in-app integration (Google "in app purchase donation"), with Apple not allowing straight donations because they're legally a different kind of transaction. This used to be in the app review guidelines, but it seems that either the policy is gone or Apple isn't explicitly stating it anymore. My mistake, either way, for not having a source ready. <comment196966> FWIW my app with this feature has been approved by Apple. I had to provide a screen for the in app. I provided just a screen of the popup that ask for confirmation (and shows the price). <comment201910> I'm trying to decide if this is best implemented as a "Consumable" or "Non-Consumable" in-app purchase.  I suppose a "Consumable" would allow a user to provide the same tip multiple times?
