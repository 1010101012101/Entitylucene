How to copy Apple Calendar Server data to a new installation? <body> I have recently reinstalled my Mac Mini server. It was acting up after the upgrade from SLS to Lion Server, so I reinstalled with Lion.  I can't figure out how to properly migrate calendar data from the old installation.  I have tried copying code/Library/Server/Calendar and Contacts//code from the old installation to the new one, but that makes no difference I can see. Can anyone help me figure out how to do it?  <comment26739> Did you backup your OD data? <comment26765> I still have the old installation on an old disk, fully bootable, so I should have backups of almost everythingâ€¦ <comment26862> If you can do an OpenDirectory export/import or migration and then copy your Calendar and Contacts data, it should work.
