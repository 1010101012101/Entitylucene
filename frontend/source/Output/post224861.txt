How to bind a key to press two separate keys <body> In other words, if I press "x", it registers as me pressing "a" and "b" sequentially.   I run Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.5. A Karabiner solution eludes me, thus I am researching more.  <answer224866> To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;X to A and B&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;appendix&gt;When you type X, A and B are written&lt;/appendix&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;x2ab&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::X, KeyCode::A, KeyCode::B&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the remapping.

Leave a comment if you want to know how or specify your question.  <comment272750> How should I make it so that if G is pressed, both the up arrow key and "w" are pressed at the same time? Also for a specific app. Thanks for the answer though! And whilst I'm waiting, I'll also try to figure it out. <comment272753> There is no question in the question? Also, which platform/OS version are you using? <comment272979> Apple.stackexchange, so I was hoping people would assume Mac. Sorry for not specifying earlier, but this is Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.5. The Karabiner solution below is the closest thing to a solution, but not quite, thus I am researching more.
