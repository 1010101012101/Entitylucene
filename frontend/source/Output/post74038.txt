One Apple id on two iPhone 4 <body> I am using one Apple ID for two iPhones which seems to be fine,however when I download an app on one iPhone it gets downloaded on the other too. even if I upgrade an app it gets upgraded on the second iPhone as well.  How is that possible and can I disable it ?  <answer74041> Probably emautomatic downloads/em are enabled.   You can disable them in strongSettings â†’ Store/strong as described here.
