How can iOS 11â€™s screen recording not record the control center screen? <body> We can start the screen recorder in the control center but this part also goes into the recording. How can we skip this part?  <answer288352> strongDisclaimer: As of this posting, iOS 11 is in Public Beta and may change before final release./strong  As of writing, it does not appear that a 'timer' can be set to indicate when to start the recording.  The recording does indeed start when the button on the control center is tapped.  This can be edited out of the final recording by trimming the video.  ul liGo to the video in the strongPhotos/strong app./li liUse the yellow handles (indicated by the code&lt;&gt;/code symbols) to trim the beginning and end of the video as desired./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YHPtS.png" alt="Trim Video"  <comment364177> so I suppose as of right now, there is no way to configure it to start recording after 3 seconds or something... <comment364179> Not yet, but is it still in beta so we'll wait and see.  I'm hoping a timer can be implemented, but at least for now the recording can be edited.  Cheers!
