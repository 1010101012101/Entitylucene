How to restore an external backup drive? <body> I have an external drive which contains my iTunes Media, some symlinks, and other files that are referenced elsewhere. This drive is starting to fail. I'd like to be able to replace the failing drive with it's backup drive.  I assume I can't just rename the backup drive ("Backup External Drive") to the name of the main drive ("External Drive"). Although that would be the easiest thing.  Since I am not entirely sure which files have been symlinked and such, I'd like to be able to clone the external drive contents to the backup drive. What would be the best method for doing this?
