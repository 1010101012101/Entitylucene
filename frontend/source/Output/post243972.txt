Tabs not showing <body> My safari browser tabs are all blank.. Any ideas on how to make the titles reappear?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YTtUz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer243992> Right click inside Safari, click emShow Page Source/em, then check if there is a title tag:  precode&lt;title&gt;safari - Tabs not showing - Ask Different&lt;/title&gt; /code/pre  If there is, it should work, if not, then it might be a 3rd party extension. Press kbdcmd/kbd+kbd,/kbd to bring up the Preferences, then click on the Extensions tab. Disable all extensions then restart Safari by pressing kbdcmd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd to Quit. Then open it up again.  If the title appears, enable 1 extension at a time to see which one triggers it. If you don't have any extensions and it worked, then it simply needed a restart.  Let us know if this worked! :)  <comment300547> Have you tried restarting safari?
