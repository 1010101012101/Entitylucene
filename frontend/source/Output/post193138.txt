To install unbuffer in OSX <body> There is the terminal command codeunbuffer/code in Linux Redhat, for instance.  I did not find it in homebrew.   How can you install unbuffer in OSX Yosemite 10.10.3?  <answer193152> codeunbuffer/code is part of the codeexpect/code package:  precodebrew install homebrew/dupes/expect /code/pre  You may need to:  precodebrew tap homebrew/dupes/expect /code/pre  Before you can install it.   <comment230078> I love expect! How did you find it out? <comment230082> I searched for “unbuffer command” and found a [man page](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/unbuffer1.html) which told me the author was Don Libes.  Searched for “unbuffer Don Libes” and found [another man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unbuffer.1.html) which said “This page is part of the `expect` (programmed dialogue with interactive programs) project”.  I then looked at the OS X man page for `except` and tried a few things out, and failed.  I then searched homebrew for `expect` and found there to be a package.  I installed it, et voila!
