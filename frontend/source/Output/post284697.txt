How can I transfer a Live Photo from one .photoslibrary file to another? <body> While on vacation, I imported my photos to my girlfriend’s laptop to free up space on my iPhone. She now has my Live Photos saved onto her laptop and I can view them when I open her Photos Library (.photoslibrary file).   Now that we are home, I’d like to transfer these Live Photos from her laptop (MacBook Pro) to my desktop computer (iMac) where all my photos are stored.  When I try to export the files on her computer, I get both a code.jpg/code and a code.mov/code file. I cannot import these to my Photos Library on my iMac as it will import them as a separate photo and video, not as a Live Photo.  Is there any way to transfer a Live Photo from one Photos Library to another?  <answer284700> The easiest way to transfer Live Photos is to use strongAirDrop/strong.  Starting with macOS Sierra 10.12.3, Apple added a new emLive Photos/em Smart Album to strongPhotos/strong. It can be accessed either from the strongSidebar/strong (kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd⌥ opt/kbd kbds/kbd) or in strongAlbums/strong view (kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd4/kbd).  Once you’re in there, select all the Live Photos you want to transfer, then right-click, strongShare/strong → strongAirDrop/strong.  To use AirDrop, you will need one of the following models of Macs:  ul liMacBook Pro (Late 2008) or later, excluding the MacBook Pro (17-inch, Late 2008)/li liMacBook Air (Late 2010) or later/li liMacBook (Late 2008) or later, excluding the white MacBook (Late 2008)/li liiMac (Early 2009) or later/li liMac Mini (Mid 2010) or later/li liMac Pro (Early 2009 with AirPort Extreme card, or Mid 2010)/li /ul  Apple has a support article that may help you identify which model Macs you have.  If your Mac doesn’t support AirDrop, but emhers does/em, AND you’ve managed to free up space on your iPhone, she can also AirDrop those photos to your iPhone. You can then import them into your Mac by plugging in to USB.  Barring all of the above, then you can have your girlfriend send you those Live Photos by strongiMessage/strong, then import them into your Photos Library.  As of macOS Sierra 10.12.4 and iOS 10.3.2, strongAirDrop/strong and strongiMessage/strong are the only built-in ways to share Live Photos while preserving their full quality. Using a strongShared Photo Album/strong will down-sample your photos to 2048 pixels on the long edge.  <comment358996> Best response ever. Thank you.
