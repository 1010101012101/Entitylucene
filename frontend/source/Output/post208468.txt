How can i speed up the animation of hiding the menu bar? <body> I recently installed OS X El Capitan and figured out I could hide the menu bar. But it would be nice if i could accelerate the animation. For hiding the dock menu I use these defaults. I wondered whether I can do this for the menu bar?  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 10; /code/pre  How can I get there anyway behind how I can change this in the future for other things? Is there anywhere documentation of adjusting defaults?  Thanks in advance.  <answer209095> For me it seems that this does the trick  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder autohide-delay -float 0; Killall finder /code/pre  <answer236313> To make your dock animation speed up simply enter this text in the command line:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.12;killall Dock /code/pre  To restore the dock animations back to default enter this in Terminal:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier;killall Dock /code/pre  For more information click Here.  <comment252252> That didn't work for me :/ <comment252443> For me neither.. <comment252451> It would be strange if this would work. <comment255103> Seems like this response might be from [this thread](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/5275#27568) which is more of a question than an answer. <comment305394> This answer is regarding the Dock and is not in any way related to the question
