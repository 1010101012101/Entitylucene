can i move over music from my mp3 player to my iphone 6s? <body> i moved all my music from my mp3 into my itunes library with no problem. But when i try to put it onto my phone it's telling me it can't find it. is it because they were not bought on Itunes?  <comment341264> Best guess is because you didn't copy it to the HD, you left it in its original location. If it can find it with the mp3 player connected, then you need to consolidate the library. File menuLibraryOrganise...  Consolidate. Then for the future, Prefs Advanced  Copy files to iTunes Media... check. That will prevent it happening again. <comment341353> i'm sorry.  What is the HD? <comment341355> HD = Hard Drive... though in this instance it could be solid state drive... the thing your computer boots from & stores information... <comment341359> oh, duh, sorry i thought you were talking about something on itunes.   obviously i not up to par on my tech tems.  :)
