How do I rename files by moving the first 4 numbers <body> How do I rename files by moving the first 4 characters (numbers in my case) in file name to the end of the filename using A Better Finder Renamer?  <answer292954> I made an example scenario in Better Finder Rename 10 supsub(10.20)/sub/sup  My filenames:  precode0001 - Example.svg 0002 - Example.svg 0003 - Example.svg 0004 - Example.svg 0005 - Example.svg 0006 - Example.svg 0007 - Example.svg 0008 - Example.svg 0009 - Example.svg 0010 - Example.svg 0011 - Example.svg 0012 - Example.svg /code/pre  I used the codeMulti-step drawer/code to do this, since I wanted to also clean up the new filename so that there is a space between the numbers once they are at the end and I also wanted to remove the code-/code in the front, since it wouldn't be needed anymore.  hr  First I add a space to the end in preparation of the numbers:     This is its own step   ul liCategory: codeText/code/li liAction: codeAdd text to end/code/li liAdd: code/code supsub&lt;- a single space/sub/sup/li liChange: codeThe filename without the extension/code/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a3zKY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then I move the numbers to the end:     This is its own step   ul liCategory: codeCharacter Positions &amp; Ranges/code/li liAction: codeMove a range of characters to position/code/li listrongFrom text position/strong: code0/code, codeFrom the front/code/li listrongA number of characters/strong: codeNext/code, code4/code/li liTo text position: code0/code, codeFrom the end/code/li liChange: codeOnly the file name/code/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTbb1.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...and all that is left is to remove the spacer I had between the numbers and the text code-/code:     This is its own step   ul liCategory: codeText/code/li liAction: codeRemove text from beginning/code/li liRemove: code-/code supsub&lt;- space dash space/sub/sup/li liChange: codeThe file name without the extension/code/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ddWVP.png" alt="enter image description here"
