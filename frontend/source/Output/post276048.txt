Can't open .html file with UTF-8 <body> how could I change the file encoding using OS X? If I open a file on Windows Notepad I see all the symbols and everything is fine. If I open it using TextEdit or TextWrangler I see only question marks instead of the normal symbols. I tried to save the file as plain text using UTF-8 unicode, but it didn't changed. Any more ideas?  <answer276088> It turns out this problem was caused by the text being actually encoded as Baltic (Windows) instead of UTF-8.  <comment347347> Yes, preferences is set on UTF-8 both opening and saving documents, but it didn't helped. And yes, there is meta data with UTF-8. <comment347375> File sent, @TomGewecke
