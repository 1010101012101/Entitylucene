Cannot purchase from Mac App Store ("Connection failure" msg) <body> I have a 2008 MBP with 10.7.4. I use a WIFI and ethernet connection. I cannot purchase or download anything in the Mac App store on my computer. I can, using other folk's computers. After putting in the password, I receive a red "Connection Failure" message. Despite this message, I can click on apps in the Store to read about them. I turned off Little Snitch to no avail. Everything else on the internet works just fine. No useful assistance from Apple. Any ideas?  <answer56591> Try this: log out of your iTunes account (within the App Store choose Store  Sign Out), restart your Mac and then try to purchase/download something.  <answer56696> I FOUND the answer at the link below. The only correction I would add is to do EVERY item that has a blue cross.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4085819?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <comment64972> Are you have trouble both on your computer and others as well? <comment64987> No. Only on my computer. No problem on another Mac. <comment64990> Tried. Didn't work. Very strange problem as I hadn't had problems in the past with the Mac Store. I don't recall installing anything new the would interfere with the store. <comment64996> I FOUND the answer at the link below.

Say what worked for you and quote from the apple discussions site the information that solved the issue. <comment65139> Quote what worked for you from the original source, just in case that link goes away at some point.
