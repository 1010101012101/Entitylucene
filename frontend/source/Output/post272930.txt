How To Enable Wireless Monitoring Macbook Pro <body> I own a MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch, early 2013, and I would like to put the wireless card on board into monitor mode, but was unable to.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <answer272939> h3Use Terminal/h3  You can use the codeairport/code utility.  It's located in a very obscure place, so I suggest creating a symbolic link to it:  precodeln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport /code/pre  Now, you can put the WiFi (Airport) adapter into monitor mode:  precodesudo airport en1 sniff 6 /code/pre  This will sniff all packets on adapter en1 channel 6.  It will save a code.cap/code file in code/tmp/airportsniffXXXXXXXXX/code  You can view the output through Wireshark or issue the command codetcpdump -r [filename]/code.  For example, the following is the capture of my wireless adapter in monitor mode for a few seconds...  precode 18.0 24.0 36.0 54.0 Mbit] CH: 1, PRIVACY 17:37:37.746644 35635598us tsft 1.0 Mb/s 2412 MHz 11g -82dB signal -82dB noise antenna 0 Probe Response (yoyo) [1.0* 2.0* 5.5* 11.0* 18.0 24.0 36.0 54.0 Mbit] CH: 1, PRIVACY 17:37:37.774068 35662623us tsft bad-fcs 1.0 Mb/s 2412 MHz 11g -82dB signal -82dB noise antenna 0 Probe Response (LORRAINE) [1.0* 2.0* 5.5* 11.0* 18.0 24.0* 36.0 54.0 Mbit] CH: 1, PRIVACY 17:37:37.782831 35671401us tsft bad-fcs 1.0 Mb/s 2412 MHz 11g -84dB signal -82dB noise antenna 0 Probe Response (LORRAINE) [1.0* 2.0* 5.5* 11.0* 18.0 24.0* 36.0 54.0 Mbit] CH: 1, PRIVACY 17:37:37.793357 35683064us tsft 1.0 Mb/s 2412 MHz 11g -63dB signal -82dB noise antenna 0 Beacon (Go Noles ) [1.0* 2.0* 5.5* 11.0* 18.0 24.0 36.0 54.0 Mbit] ESS CH: 1, PRIVACY 17:37:37.796149 35686928us tsft wep 1.0 Mb/s 2412 MHz 11g -62dB signal -82dB noise antenna 0 Data IV:4767c7 Pad 20 KeyID 1 17:37:37.816820 35706464us tsft 1.0 Mb/s 2412 MHz 11g -79dB signal -82dB noise antenna 0 Beacon (yoyo) [1.0* 2.0* 5.5* 11.0* 18.0 24.0 36.0 54.0 Mbit] ESS CH: 1, PRIVACY 17:37:37.898203 35787820us tsft 1.0 Mb/s 2412 MHz 11g -62dB signal -82dB noise antenna 0 Beacon (Go Noles ) [1.0* 2.0* 5.5* 11.0* 18.0 24.0 36.0 54.0 Mbit] ESS CH: 1, PRIVACY 17:37:37.919172 35808864us tsft 1.0 Mb/s 2412 MHz 11g -81dB signal -82dB noise antenna 0 Beacon (yoyo) [1.0* 2.0* 5.5* 11.0* 18.0 24.0 36.0 54.0 Mbit] ESS CH: 1, PRIVACY /code/pre  hr  h3Use a GUI/h3  ol liLaunch Wireless Diagnostics.

Unfortunately it's really not clear. What does _put the wireless card on board into monitor_ mean?  Also, can you expand your question to include what you've already tried (saying _but was unable to_) does not help us to help you. <comment343093> @Monomeeth I'm not sure what's unclear about this. Maybe it is just missing `mode` after `into monitor`? <comment343095> **People voting to close** - This question is quite clear and very much on topic.  *Monitor* (mode) is to put it into a mode to "sniff" packets <comment343110> Yes, that (adding _mode_) makes it clearer (for me at least). I think it was the combination of the _on board_ with the _into monitor_ that confused me. Thanks @Allan for the clarification. <comment343211> Followed your answer, I tried to put my WiFi (Airport) adapter into monitor mode by issuing this command in terminal: sudo airport en1 sniff 6 but I got something different. How could I upload the wifi log file for to let you know what has happened? <comment343212> You could try pastebin <comment343216> I've uploaded the wifi log file to: http://pastebin.com/EC83DCXr <comment343343> are you there Allan? Just wondering if you saw my last message saying that my log file has been uploaded to Pastebin. <comment343357> What you have in pastebin is the standard error message from `airport`.  Two things you can try:  leave the interface off - `sudo airport sniff 1` and/or get the actual interface of your wireless adapter - `system_profiler SPAirPortDataType | grep Interfaces -A10` <comment343359> ok I'll do so and will let you know later, because I'm on the road right now! Thanks.
