How do I disable/configure macOS Sierra's auto throttling of the CPU for processor intensive tasks <body> I'm using an iMac (late 2015) with an Intel core i7 (quad core) 4GHz CPU with 32GB ram and a 3TB Fusion Drive. I'm a software developer working on a huge codebase that used to take about 30 minutes to build and run unit tests on my beast of a machine. Of course, running the build meant that the CPU usage was up through the roof and the fan working at its fastest speed.  I upgraded to macOS sierra yesterday, and my first attempt to build the project I'm working on took three and a half hours! During this time my computer and fan were as quiet as a sleeping baby.  I did some investigation and found that whenever a process uses too much CPU power to the extent of making the fans audible, in just a couple of seconds I see the CPU usage of this process falling down, and after a few minutes, the fan sound goes down too. It seems that in Sierra a feature was added to make sure that the CPU doesn't overheat by throttling the processor usage for high CPU demand processes automatically.  What I need to know is how to disable/configure this feature, because it's killing my productivity. I really love the emother/em great features in Sierra, but I would certainly downgrade if there is no way to disable this auto-throttling.  <answer254352> Here are a few broad steps from a post on "Disable OS X kernel_task throttling" which you will need to try since I don't have an iMac on hand. Strongly suggest you read the post in detail and also understand potential risks before executing this sequence.  ol liDisable strongSystem Integrity Protection/strong so you can make system folder edits with steps atbr How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless” on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?/li liBoot into single-user mode with codeCommand-S/code sequence/li liMount the filesystem:br codefsck -y; mount -uw //code /li liBackup the codeIOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/code extensionbr codersync -av /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext /Users/Shared//code/li linow delete the IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext extension and restartbr coderm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext; shutdown -r now/code/li /ol  If/when you want to restore the configuration,br codersync -av /Users/Shared/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext /System/Library/Extensions/code  The code/Users/Shared//code location for storing extension is a subjective choice. You can backup in any other safe place (even on an external drive). As long as you can retrieve it when you want to rollback this action.  <comment316725> Thanks. I'll try this soon, and if it works, I'll mark this as the accepted answer <comment339798> Worked for me. 59˚C and no slowdowns. Used to get thermal throttling at 45˚C. <comment341294> Doesn't this action risk the CPU running at minimal speed, i e it also turns off Turbo?
