On the iOS app side, imo seems to be a popular choice, though I can't personally vouch for it (the mobile web interface works fine for me when I'm away from a real computer)  <answer12308> For an app that can not only handle the IM features of Gtalk, but also the voice features, check out Talkatone.  Otherwise, there's too many iOS apps to list that can interface with Gtalk via their XMPP protocol, as well as accessing Google's web app via Mobile Safari.  <answer12353> I like to use an app called eBuddy http://www.ebuddy.com/ that I use for a Gtalk chat client. It also lets you use other chat clients like AIM and msn. There are many different apps out there that I am sure do the same thing but I really like eBuddy.   <comment12847> I think the talkone is like viber <comment12854> There IS a lot apps to access gtalk. BUT, the best app for that is no doubt the BeejiveIM app. <comment12979> dear lord ebuddy is evil! http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/ybenjamin/detail?entry_id=46417  search for ebuddy <comment13135> AFAIK Viber does not interface with Google Talk or Google Voice.
