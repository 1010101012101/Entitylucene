TimeMachine fails about once a month on Western Digital NAS <body> Using Time Machine (Lion 10.7.3) [ EDIT: or 10.7.2 see my comment below ] with an Airport Extreme and Western Digital MyBookLive NAS seems to work well but then fails about once a month with the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7JGRO.png" alt="enter image description here"  and then all the backups are corrupt and need to be recreated.   Any suggestions on how to get it to work?  <comment47145> Are you still having issues with this? Have you started a new backup or are still letting this periodic check go uncorrected? <comment47328> I submitted this to Apple Bugs about a month ago and was using a USB Time Machine backup instead.  I also run Time Machine to the same NAS from a desktop Mac and it has been running flawlessly for a year.  It seems it is due to some waking misbehavior of the 2011 MBAir.  A recent firmware update from Apple related to this may help.
