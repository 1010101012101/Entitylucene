"No Devices Syncing" in menu bar <body> Previously in the menu bar when I click on the "Refresh" icon it use to say Sync Now and now it says No Devices Syncing.  Is this feature now obsolete due to MobileMe not available anymore?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jN3ww.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer71245> Yes you are correct, this was part of MobileMe and is no longer supported.
