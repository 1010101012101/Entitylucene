Turn on Do Not Disturb mode on all devices from one device <body> Has anyone found a way to turn on Do Not Disturb mode for every device from one.   Often times when I'm trying to work and people won't shut up I turn on DND mode on my MBP but then my iPhone will start dinging away. So I turn on DND mode there too. Then iPad starts up etc. This is an almost endless process. There's an additional 2 other Macs tied into my iCloud account. I've been tempted to just turn it off completely but it's about as handy as it is annoying.   Also find that when I need to turn DND mode off I forget on 1 device or more causing some annoyance if I actually need the notifications.   Ideally I'd like to be able to activate DND mode globally from my MBP.  I'm curious if anyone else has seen a possible solution to this.
