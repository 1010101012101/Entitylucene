Can I have the same Apple ID in my iPhone and my iPad <body> How can I have de same Apple ID in my iPhone and my iPad (so that I can use the apps on iPad that I have in iPhone and "vice versa")  <answer96980> Sure you can. Go into Settings and find the following tabs:  ul liiTunes and App Store/li liiCloud/li /ul  Then just log in with your Apple ID. They must be same in iPhone and iPad in order to share app purchases.  <answer191948> If you had your iPad first then before you do go into settingsiCloud scroll downfind my iPad and turn it off. If you had your iPhone first do the same thing but go on find my iPhone and turn that off.  <answer191950> Do you mean login app store with the same Apple ID and password  for app installation? Sure you can, and actually the app you have installed on your iPad can be directly sync to your iPhone.  <answer191955> Be sure to only use strongone/strong Apple ID since it becomes confusing by having two Apple ID's. Especially since you would have two buy each App twice.   <answer228591> The best way is to use one Apple ID among all of your Apple ID devices. In rear cases you will need separate Apple ID accounts when you need to separate contacts or other private info. In this case you should use different Apple ID in Settings  iCloud, but still use the same Apple ID for purchasing content in App Store and iTunes Store on both devices.  <answer270390> You can change your iCloud settings in  precodeSettings &gt; iTunes and App Store /code/pre  as well as  precodeSettings &gt; iCloud /code/pre  If you have two accounts and want to use one on both, you’ll need to sign out on the device with the second account. In iCloud Preferences scroll down, and tap ‘Sign Out’. Read through any instructions very carefully, and follow them.   In iTunes and App Store Preferences, tap your email, and then ‘Sign Out’.   Then, you can log back in with the first account.  Hope that helps.  <comment113767> It's a bit unclear what you are looking for here. The name of your phone is not related to your Apple ID, so are you looking to change the name of your phone or do you want to log in with the same Apple ID on both devices?
