I can't get it to work in 7.3, though. They just updated it but I still can't get it working. When it works, it's nice. <comment285292> Thx @DanBeaulieu I'll check it out. <comment285333> I'll use this method to install on my iMac and see how it goes. Thanks. <comment287936> I followed all the steps and it worked like a charm! thanks!
