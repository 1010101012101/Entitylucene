Dotted underlines in Word for Macbook users 2011 <body> I am doing an editorial job and need to underline some words with red dotted underlines. How do you do this using Word for Mac users? The version I have is 2011, on a MacBook with Snow Leopard software.  <answer178521> Select the text you want to underline, right click and select 'font'.   Now you can set the underline style and color.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDjUH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
