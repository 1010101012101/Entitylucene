iOS b2b Acceptance Criteria <body> Could someone please tell me if iOS b2b apps undergo the same acceptance review (or the same level of acceptance review) from Apple that regular public apps do?  I need to solve a problem w/ a client that a native app would solve, but the app would really be nothing more than a notification push.  I worry that under normal circumstances it would get denied for "lack of originality" or whatever.  <comment118139> I can't answer your direct question but there is at least one app that is just a push notification service for websites that don't have their own apps. So I probably wouldn't worry about being denied for aesthetic reasons. <comment118141> Do you know that app... I may be able to get away w/ just leveraging that <comment118151> It's called [Alert Rocket](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alertrocket-push-notification/id477125272?mt=8).
