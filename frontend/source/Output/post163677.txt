Is there a way to install a Yosemite theme on mavericks? Without Flavours? <body> strongI have Mavericks on my mac and I want to make it look like Yosemite. Is there an alternative to Flavours (my trial period is running out) that will allow me to install a Yosemite theme for FREE?/strong  I found out about Flavours here: http://nssenterprises.blogspot.com/2014/12/how-to-make-mavericks-look-like.html  Direct link to Flavours theme:  http://store.interacto.net/flavours/uuid/903EB28F-54EB-4100-9957-F6F8BCF7C483  If you have Flavours copy the link below (auto-link does not work)  flavour://903EB28F-54EB-4100-9957-F6F8BCF7C483  <comment191669> Why don't you just update? <comment191670> I can't because my apps aren't compatible yet.
