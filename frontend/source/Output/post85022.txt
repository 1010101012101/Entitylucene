iPhone won't play music from safari through external speakers when on silent <body> My iPhone 4S won't play music through the external speakers when my phone is on silent, and this problem is only restricted to safari - it works for other apps, even the google app when I tried playing YouTube there. I got my iPhone in late 2011, and I've never had this problem before, it's ony recently (as in, yesterday) that the problem began  <comment97901> When you say 'music', how are you playing that through Safari? Like a Youtube video, or a HTML5 audio player (such as SoundCloud.com)? <comment97906> Also, how might your external speakers be connected to the phone? Headphone jack, bluetooth, dock connector or some other connection such as AirPlay? You can just edit this detail into the question if no-one guesses the correct answer. <comment97908> It appears as if this behaviour has changed in iOS 6 http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/04/its-not-just-you-the-mute-toggle-of-your-iphone-works-different-on-ios-6/ But that should not be affecting Safari... Are you definitely using Safari.app, and not the web view in another app?
