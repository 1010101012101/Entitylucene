installing windows from bootcamp with image dvd <body> I'm trying to install windows 7 with bootcamp. I get the following message, after mounting windows image (.iso)     Insert your Windows installer disc and   wait a few seconds for the disc to be   recognized.   I did the same thing on the imac and it was fine, but now, on the macbook, osx seems not to recognize the dvd.  Do you know could I fix this problem?  <answer14378> You cannot use an ISO image with the Boot Camp Assistant. It only allows a disc, as:  ol liYou need to install it outside of Mac OS X/li liYou cannot mount an image when Mac OS X is not running/li liMac OS X's EFI bootloader only accepts physical storage media/li /ol  Thus, you can only use a disc. To burn the ISO to a CD/DVD, mount the image, open disk utility, insert a blank disk and click on burn. After burning the disc, you should be able to use it for Boot Camp.  <answer14379> Try booting up the iso image from a harddrive?
