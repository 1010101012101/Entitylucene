Change duration of still frames in iMovie 10.0.7 <body> I am making a video that contains both video footage and still frames but I can't find where to change duration of still frames to longer than 4 seconds.  How can I change the duration of a still frame to be longer than 4 seconds in iMovie 10.0.7?  <answer179784> Open the app and search for Freeze Frame in the help menu.  Select the help topic named:  h1- Add a freeze frame/h1  It explains how to freeze a frame and at the bottom of the page, it describes how to modify the 4 second default.  <comment213273> Also - rather than asking a new question - please edit this or flag it if the linked question does not answer your question.
