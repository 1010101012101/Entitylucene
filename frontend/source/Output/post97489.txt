How to tell if a bookmark already exists in Safari (v6.0.5) <body> I find I often wrestle with the implementation of bookmarks in Safari.  Since I care to have my bookmarks simply and cleanly synchronized by iCloud, I continue to use the (inadequate) bookmark features of Safari.  My specific question is: Is there a way to tell if a site is already bookmarked?  I have 1000s of bookmarks, organized by folders.  It seems pretty straightforward for Safari to know when I hit CMD-D to initiate a bookmark that it already exists in my collection.  Am I missing this feature that is already implemented?  <answer97503> Safari has a bookmark search function in the top right corner of the bookmark menu window,  Just paste the new bookmark (or type first 3 letters) in to it and it will tell you if it already exist.   It is also useful in finding bookmarks in a very large library.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GPSYF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment114407> That is one way.  But, if you are ready to bookmark a page, you have to at least open a new tab, click copy/paste the prospective bookmark, and see what comes up.  It seems like an obvious feature is to have the "Add bookmark..." shortcut (CMD-D) have feedback on existing bookmarks.  I suppose what you are really saying is that that feature does not presently exist (either as shipped or with an add-on)? <comment114514> And dammit, that Safari bookmark search function can't distinguish between Bookmarks and History, which makes it way less useful. <comment114617> @Zo219 Indeed.  I wonder if it possible for a Safari extension to implement this sort of feature (ie., add a "flag" to the Add Bookmark... shortcut dialog to indicate if a bookmark already exists). <comment278402> This is a basic and important feature. It is surprising why Safari does not have it.
