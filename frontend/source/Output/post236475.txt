Apple Watch notifications have blurry app icons <body> When I receive a notification from an app which does not have a corresponding Watch app, the short look notification displays an upscaled app icon. I notice this mainly with Facebook and Instagram. Surely this is a bug?  <comment289456> Can you post a photo? To take a screenshot on Apple Watch, press the Digital Crown and side button at the same time. <comment289511> @RedEagle2000 I've tried, but it's hard to get it in time.
