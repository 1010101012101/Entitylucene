Multiple monitors for MBP 15" Mid 2012 <body> I'm looking for a solution with four external displays and my MBP lid closed.  As far as I know it's not possible natively so I need some extra box?  <comment212908> Do you have the monitors already? What inputs are available? I think USB adapters could do the trick <comment212922> Yes. DP/RGP/DVI. What USB adapters do you have in mind? I use a DisplayLink one today and it's bad. <comment212973> Do you want one or more of these displays to be mirrored, or do they all need to be independant? <comment213090> The initial goal is to have all independent. <comment258608> Any luck since April? <comment258722> @DAVincent, no. I don't have the computer in question or the need anymore.
