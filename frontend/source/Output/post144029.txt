Apple Id confusion <body> I just created an Apple ID. Went through the confirmation via email phase successfully.  I am able to log in on this page: https://appleid.apple.com - and under codeApple ID and Primary Email Address/code it says it is verified.   However, attempting to reinstall OS X Lion (following a Command - R combo at restart), when I am asked to enter my Apple ID, I get the spinning wheel and then I am being told that codeThis Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store. Please review your account information./code Clicking on the codeReview/code button doesn't do anything.   Stumped.  <answer144030> in my experience there are different levels of appleID approval.  for instance, it can work fine for updates but will need to verify with CC info to use the app store etc.  can you go onto a machine with app store or itunes and 'buy' a free app?  i suspect it will make you enter more info, or verify a CC security id, or something.  after this point, your ID will be blessed for all activities.  <comment169676> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about a temporary network issue <comment169678> @Mark Let's leave this up. There should be a thread covering what happens when the service is down. Even if it's rare, it surely will happen again and pointers to http://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/ don't always show when a service is having issues.. <comment169680> @Mark Hi Mark, maybe I wasn't clear. The fact that discussions.apple.com was down has no bearing on the initial issue - I mentioned it only to make it clear that I wasn't even able to Google an answer for my problem. Sorry for the confusion I have created. The machine I was attempting to install OS X on and the one I was using for Internet browsing are on different networks. <comment169681> Thank you, this solved my issue; I created an account w/o a payment option by following this tutorial: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2534 . Now on to solve another problem: why OS X Lion is an item "temporarily unavailable". <comment169682> I can deff. see my poor choice of words. I would edit my initial text, but I am afraid this would leave your comments "hanging". Apologies, again. <comment169686> No edit the question to make it clear. Comments aren't meant to stay around <comment169688> @Mark Done, thanks for the tip. <comment169689> @Tetsujin: I will certainly do, appreciated.
