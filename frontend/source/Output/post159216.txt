Run a program/script when the screen is locked or unlocked <body> Is there a way to run a specified script or program when the screen is locked or unlocked? Ideally a bash function or an AppleScript.  Is there an event that I could subscribe to that would allow me to do that? Or an existing app that supports this?  <answer159405> EventScript has a few options that might work for you.  It's a neat little utility that can trigger .sh/applescript/automator workflows and trigger them on a host of different options.   Here's some screen locking/unlocking options: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vg1T5.png" alt="EventScripts"  Check it out here: http://mousedown.net/mouseware/EventScripts.html  <answer159510> After some searching, I found SleepWatcher, a free tool that allows to run a script when the screen goes to sleep or wakes up.  After installing it, you can link a shell script that is run on one of the available events (which include emdim screen/em, emwake up screen/em, emcomputer sleep/em, emwake up computer/em and some more). From the shell script, I can run a command, or call an AppleScript that I want to run on these events.  Since my screen goes to sleep when I lock my computer, this is exactly what I was looking for.  You can see it in action here: https://github.com/nwinkler/sleepwatcher-lync-status  <comment187144> For the lockscreen, there's notification sent which can be handled in Your Cocoa app. You'd need to listen to notificaiton called: "com.apple.screenIsLocked". Code: `[[NSDistributedNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(handleNotification:) name:@"com.apple.screenIsLocked" object:nil];` <comment187148> Is there a way to get a hold of this through AppleScript? <comment187151> Sorry I don't know of Apple Script way of doing this. But creating Your own app for this task is not so difficult. Let me know if I can help. <comment187284> As an addition notification sent when screen is unlocked is named: "com.apple.screenIsUnlocked" <comment187442> That looks pretty useful, thanks! It's $3.99 in the App Store.
