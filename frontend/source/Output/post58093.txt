View location of a document open in Preview <body> I've got a PDF open in Preview (5.5.2) and I want to know where it is located in my filesystem. How can I find that out in Preview? In MS Word, there's a command called codeDocument Properties/code which gives detailed information about the active document; I'm looking for an equivalent.  Aside: I've been able to do this in a roundabout fashion from the command-line by piping codelsof/code through codegrep/code using an expression that contained a word in the document title.  <answer58095> kbdCmd/kbd-Click on the title gives you the full path. This not only works in Preview but more or less in all applications (including Office).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YiAPP.png" alt="enter image description here"
