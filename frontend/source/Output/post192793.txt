Is there a rhyming dictionary I can run on the OSX command line? <body> Is there a rhyming dictionary I can run on the OSX command line?  I found these but don't know how to get them running on my Mac:    ul lihttps://trac.macports.org/ticket/39651  /li lihttp://osl.no.distfiles.macports.org/rhyme/  /li lihttps://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhyme  /li /ul  It looks like the rhyme package is for Ubuntu. How can I get it working on OSX?  <answer192803> ol liInstall MacPorts/li li$ port install rhyme/li /ol  Source: @skarface  <answer239449> I put together a Homebrew tap for Rhyme. Please see:  https://github.com/shaunplee/homebrew-rhyme  <comment229529> Did you try installing it via macports?   (I didn't see a homebrew package available) <comment229540> MacPorts! That worked! <comment237207> I now have Homebrew installed and rhyme stopped working. Is there a way to reinstall it without messing up my Homebrew install? I know you're not supposed to have both Homebrew and MacPorts installed at the same time. <comment293920> I get `Error: No such file or directory - rhyme`: <comment293930> Hmm. This is my first time writing a Homebrew formula. Would you mind helping me debug by sending the output of `brew install --verbose rhyme`? (opening an issue in the github repo might be a cleaner place for this conversation) Thanks! <comment294079> Sure! Here you go: https://gist.github.com/73504e929b28632295f2cf1d32e14386 <comment294148> Interesting. It looks like it's failing because can't find `readline.h` and my original version of the formula didn't actually use the Homebrew copy of `readline`. I've edited the formula to use that instead. Try `brew update` and then `brew install rhyme` <comment294459> thanks, that worked perfectly! Thank you so much!
