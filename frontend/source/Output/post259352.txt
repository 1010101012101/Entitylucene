Is SmcFanControl safe to use for Macbook Air (early 2015)? <body> Is SmcFanControl safe to use for  Macbook Air (early 2015). It recently has been abnormally hot so I decided to search the web to make sure it was ok. I literally just bought the computer in late August. It doesn't mess with the computers already auto fan regulating thing right?  Also, when it is less hot are you supposed to turn the app off or should u leave it on all the time??  Again I just decided to download this fan regulating app because I didn't like how hot the computer has gotten and I know that the macbook airs are very delicate.
