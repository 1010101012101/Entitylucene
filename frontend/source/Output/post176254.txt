Automatically upload songs to iPod <body> I would like to know how, when I check the box next to a song in My Music then sync my iPod, I can make sure the song is uploaded to my iPod. It's a new iTunes installation (v. 12.1.1.4 on Windows 7) but an old iPod (2nd generation Nano, running up-to-date system 1.1.3).  Somehow, when I first plugged my iPod, I clicked a few checkboxes and it just worked, it asked me whether I wanted to delete everything and sync, and it just did. Then, whenever I'd add a song and sync'ed, it just worked.  Then I accidentally deleted all the files on my iPod through Windows Explorer while I wanted to wipe out a USB flash drive. From there, it's been hell getting the iPod to work with iTunes correctly again.  The best I have been able to do is get it to delete songs from the iPod when I emun/emcheck them in iTunes by using "Sync only checked songs". But whether I select the "Manually manage" option or not, the only way I can emadd/em a song to my iPod is by using the "Add To..." button, like for a playlist.  To me, iTunes is a bit like Windows, a software that you cannot really understand and for which there is nothing to do when it goes wrong but to toy around and try different things at random until it gets somewhat better. But I would just emlove/em for you to prove me wrong on this. :-)  <comment208061> Did you do a Restore? <comment208062> @Tetsujin, Yes I did.
