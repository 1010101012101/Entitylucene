After I dragged the firefox icon to the application folder, everything was fine except I was left with a "Firefox 15.0.1.dmg" file that I didn't know what to do.   I experimented with it and tried ejecting the "disk" and dragging it to trash and emptying it. After I did that the Firefox icon on my dock went black and there was no response when I clicked the FireFox icon on my dock.   So I had to redownload and reinsintall everything to make it work again.   Are these dmg files stuck in my computer forever?
