How to configure the network in VMware Fusion and mac to surf the internet? <body> my mac pro have ethernet and wi-fi, and i configure the vm-fusion with "Share with my mac", and after configure it successfully, i can ping the mac host well, but i can go internet in my VMware fusion OS which is centos 5.4, i find the issue:  my wifi ip is "192.168.10.12" my mac vmnet8 ip is "192.168.157.1"   and the VMware fusion OS ip is dhcp, "192.168.157.152", i set the gateway to "192.168.157.1", so i don't know how can surf internet?  <comment113889> did the default settings not work? Try doing "Bridged Networking" if the "Share with My Mac" option isn't working, and your router should handle everything. And change the gateway back to its default, it shouldn't be the IP of another machine
