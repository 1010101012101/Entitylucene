Maximize windows just like Windows on OS X <body> I have owned a MacBook Pro for a year, however at work I use a Windows laptop. Since I really like the functionality to maximize a windows by just pushing it to the top of the screen, I would like to have that on my Macbook too.  I am using Spectacle to assign shortcuts like "windows" to maximize a window, which works well and I recommend it.  However, is there any application to maximize a window like the way you can do it on a Windows laptop/pc, just by pushing the window to the top of the screen?  Note: I mean maximize window, not fullscreen.  <answer228685> There's a www.bettertouchtool.net app which does exactly what You need. You can download a trial and check it.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lP2iG.png" alt="enter image description here"  There's also Better Snap Tool from the same developer on the MacAppStore which does only window snapping.  <answer228686> There is a simple, but annoying standard way: hold kbdalt/opt/kbd when clicking the green button on the top bar. It will strongchange into a plus/strong instead of the double arrow, and after clicking your window will be maximized.  <answer228690> There is an app called Cinch that mimics the Windows behavior you've described.  You can run it in demo mode, indefinitely, to see it does what you want before purchasing it.      Cinch gives you simple, mouse-driven window management by defining the   left, right, and top edges of your screen as 'hot zones'. Drag a   window until the mouse cursor enters one of these zones then drop the   window to have it cinch into place. Cinching to the left or right   edges of the screen will resize the window to fill exactly half the   screen, allowing you to easily compare two windows side-by-side   (splitscreen). Cinching to the top edge of the screen will resize the   window to fill the entire screen (fullscreen). Dragging a window away   from its cinched position will restore the window to its original   size.   <answer228696> If you are still looking for an alternative way, have a look at Spectacle.  ul liYou can select from the menu or use a keyboard shortcut.

It's similar to the Windows double click but some apps don't fill the whole screen. Not exactly click and drag like you were asking, but this way you don't need to install any third party apps.  <answer268426> Hold kbdshift/kbd + kbdopt/kbd and click the green maximise button on the top left part of the window.  <answer272168> You can do that using Split Screen Ultimate.   When you press Control key and move the window to the top section of the screen, it will maximize the window - the way you want.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Puejl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZoO0.png" alt="enter image description here"  Disclosure: I own this app.  <comment278872> Yes but not on the whole screen, just the height. <comment278878> That's strange. On my Yosemite it does maximize both width and height, with the curious exception of Safari on large external monitors. <comment278891> This actually invokes the zoom command, which is not the same as maximise. Zoom is supposed to enlarge the window such that it makes best use of the available screen space for its content. What this means is left to the application to decide. Safari won't enlarge horizontally if the webpage already fits in the window without a horizontal scroll bar. Some applications do just maximise the window. <comment278921> It's worth noting that this used to be how it worked in OS X, too - the all-knowing apple decided that the users clearly wanted fullscreen instead with a recent OS X update. I'm stuck on 10.7 so I still have the old functionality, at least. Also, holding 'option' (alt) while clicking the fullscreen button should do it. <comment278923> "I am using Spectacle to assign shortcuts like "windows" to maximize a window" @Thijs Kempers already mentioned about it. <comment278928> @Wyatt8740: at least the current fullscreen behaviour is more consistent. I'd heard hundreds of people calling the green button the "maximise" button instead. <comment278933> @BenS As long as consistent means bloody annoying and change for the sake of change, I'll agree. I called the green button maximise because that's what it does for 99% of programs on old versions of OSX. <comment373334> I have not enough point to answer but I found an interested way: hold alt key and double click on window edge to maximize horizontal or vertical, on window corner to maximize both!
