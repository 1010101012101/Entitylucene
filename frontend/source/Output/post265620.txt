No boot-args in nvram <body> After seeing this question regarding the serverperfmode nvram boot-arg, I thought I would check my server to see its status:  precode$ nvram boot-args nvram: Error getting variable - 'boot-args': (iokit/common) data was not found /code/pre  Is this a normal response (i.e., if no boot-args have been set), or is something out of whack with my server.  Apple's support page doesn't mention the error.   My server is a Mac Pro running 10.11.6, off of a internal SSD.  And, Server.app is installed/configured.  Output of codenvram -p/code shows the following variables:  precodeefi-boot-device bluetoothInternalControllerInfo fmm-computer-name efi-apple-recovery SystemAudioVolumeDB bluetoothActiveControllerInfo SystemAudioVolume eft-boot-device-data BootCampProcessorPstates /code/pre
