How to install gpg without Admin password <body> I have a monitored OS X laptop that I would like to put GNU Privacy Guard (gpg) on.  Of course I can't because I don't have Admin rights, but I was hoping there is a way to install it in user space through a virtual environment or chroot, or some other wizardry, or by exacting the package files.  Obviously I only need console access to the app.  <answer202110> I don't believe this is a feature that is available yet, as GPG does provide functions which require root access.  However, the issue appears to be on their radar as there exists a ticket.  See the ticket here  And 3 forum posts have been tied to that ticket.  <comment243758> Sure.. the full GPG Tools suite would be awesome... but all I was looking for is `tar -xzvf SomeGpgBins.tar.gz`.  Looked at GPG4USB but they don't have OSX binaries. <comment243830> Went ahead and made a hack using OpenSSL.  Something to play with until another option is available.
