Change default alert sound from terminal in Mac OSX <body> The version of Mac OS X being used is 10.8.5.  When I click the back button on an empty terminal windows if give a alert sound which is the 'Funk' sound in the System Preferences - Sound - Sound Effects  I tried going to the Terminal Preferences - Settings - Advanced where there is a checkbox for turning the Audible/Visual Bell but not change the audible bell.  Can this sound be changed to anything else in the Sound Effects list like Submarine, Tink etc.  <answer114430> I don't know how to make Terminal use a different alert sound, but if others search for how to change the OS X-wide alert sound from a script, change the codecom.apple.sound.beep.sound/code key in the codecom.apple.systemsound/code domain:  precodedefaults write com.apple.systemsound com.apple.sound.beep.sound /System/Library/Sounds/Frog.aiff /code/pre  <answer265438> It looks like for macOS Sierra you simply need to change the Alert Sound under the Sound System Preferences (System Preferences  Sound  Sound Effects).  <answer283791> In Sierra:  precodedefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.sound.beep.sound /System/Library/Sounds/Submarine.aiff /code/pre  <comment323588> This no longer seems to work in macOS Sierra. Do you have a new approach here? <comment372128> @WadeWilliams: It works for me using *El Capitan*, but iTerm2 needs to be restarted for the change to take effect. Interestingly, the change registers immediately for the Terminal app.
