How can I troubleshoot sharing problems from outside the LAN? <body> I'm trying to connect with a server that is not on the same network as my mac, when I enter the ip address the connection doesn't go through. The ip is correct, the server is on, and remote access &amp; login are allowed; I even tried sending the login name i.e afp://ipaddres/shortname. Is there something I am not doing or doing wrong?  <answer21203> You may need to set up port forwarding so that you can connect to your server even though it's behind NAT from your router.  <comment23212> Is this something you can set from system preferences? <comment23213> No, it's a setting on your router. <comment23219> http://homepage.mac.com/car1son/static_port_fwd_intro.html will read instructions in link above & see if I can figure something out
