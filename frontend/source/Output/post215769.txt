Can't uninstall Java under El Capitan <body> Since installing El Capitan, I am not able to run Adobe Photoshop or Dreamweaver (old versions).  I get the message "You need to install the legacy Java SE runtime"  I am trying to uninstall Java and reinstall the Java SE 6 runtime I downloaded from Apple, but even though I am sure all traces of Java are gone, I am still not able to install. Every time I try to install the runtime, I get a message that says: "Java for OS X 2014-001 can't be installed on this disk. A newer version of this package is already installed."  I already removed /Library/Java and everything under it. I also checked /etc/paths and Java is removed.  Not sure whatever vestiges of Java remain, but I am still getting the message.  <answer215815> This link solved the problem for me: Java for OS X 2014-001: How to re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 web plug-in and Web Start features  Learn how to re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 Java SE 6 web plug-in and Web Start features in OS X Lion and later.
