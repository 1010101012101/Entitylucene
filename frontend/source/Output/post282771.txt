How to use /usr/sbin/scselect in cron? <body> I have a script that detects where I am and then tries to change my network-location-setting to match that location.  It works fine if I run code/usr/sbin/scselect &lt;location&gt;/code, but when i put the script in cron, It complains about     Only local console users and administrators can change locations   How can I allow my cron-script to change my network location setting?  <comment356371> Can you post the *contents* of your script?   `scselect` is not a command within macOS and as such, we can't replicate your issue.  What command is it **specifically** trying to execute? <comment356374> My script is a php-script, that tries to execute the scselect, that was already installed, here is the php-script: https://pastebin.com/aEpbtP8g, `file /usr/sbin/scselect` = '/usr/sbin/scselect: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64' <comment356375> https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/scselect.8.html <comment356377> What version of macOS are you using?  You are referencing documentation from Mavericks. <comment356378> My mistake...I was mistyping `scselect` in my terminal window. <comment356382> Ok..so now the big question...do you have admin privileges and as what user are you attempting to run the `cron` script? <comment356392> I'm the only user on the computer, and I can run the command from the console. I added the script in my private cron `crontab -e`, so it is runned as my user.
