iPhone 5 won't start after an iTunes recovery <body> I shut down my iPhone 5 phone in the middle of an iTunes purchase download.   I went to an At&amp;T store and they reset the phone. After three hours the phone went blue.  Phone will not turn back on now after doing the recovery via iTunes on the computer. The download did complete. At this point I can get the apple logo to show but that is all.  <answer164179> Force it into Recovery Mode, then restore...   ul liSwitch off the device &amp; leave it off./li liConnect the USB cable to a computer with iTunes [ideally one that has been used with the device previously]/li liWhilst bonding down the Home button, connect the device to the computer [keep holding Home until you see the 'connect to iTunes' screen./li liiTunes should launch &amp; detect the device is in Recovery Mode./li liUse iTunes to restore./li /ul  Ref: If you can't update or restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch  <comment191956> There seems to be details missing here.  What are you downloading?  a purchase or iOS updates?   Also "iOS5" is about 3 years obsolete, did you mean iPhone 5 perhaps? <comment192134> Yes Tyson thanks. I'm not good with lingo. It is the iphone 5 and it was an iTunes purchase. <comment192135> At this point I can get the apple logo to show but that is all
