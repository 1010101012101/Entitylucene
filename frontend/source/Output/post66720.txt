Getting rid of the annoying Photoshop CS6 timeline <body> Every time I open Photoshop, here it is, the annoying and obtuse timeline box. I hide it. I create my own workspace and save it. But every time I run Photoshop CS6 the timeline window is there. I close it, and open a file. Every time a file opens, the $&amp;&amp;%#$ window is back.  How do I get rid of this disgusting window?  thanks.  <answer66779> Delete your Photoshop preference folder (or at least move it temporarily).  It can be found in ~/Library/Preferences and named Adobe Photoshop CS6 Settings  Once it is gone, restart Photoshop.  It should be in a clean state.  Untick the Timeline in the Window menu and then close Photoshop.  Reopen it again and the Timeline window should not be visible (as well as when you create/open files).  <answer95655> This was happening to me on a single file, because I'd messed around with animation a little and then deleted it.  What I had to do in the end to stop the timeline opening every time I opened that file, was to copy everything into a new PSD.  <answer96633> If you want to get rid of the timeline go to the top menu and click "Windows" and then "Timeline".   <answer105662> The only way to stop the Timeline window from opening every time you open your file, you must:  ul liselect all your layers in the Layers Panel/li liclick on the options menu in the top right of the Layers Panel and select "Duplicate Layers..."/li liDuplicate to a "New" document, save the new document/li liDelete the old document with the timeline attached/li /ul  That's it! This takes about 10 seconds.
