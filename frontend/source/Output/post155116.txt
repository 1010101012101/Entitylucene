Is there a keyboard short-cut to quickly open a URL from the Finder? <body> On my Windows machine I use [Win]+R to bring up a RUN prompt where I can type in a URL to quickly go to the web.    I've been searching to find a Mac equivalent (without installing any special software) and haven't had any luck.

If you create a strongservice/strong like this one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBZtb.png" alt="enter image description here"  and save it, you can then assign a keystroke to it, so you can trigger it from the keyboard in any application.  <answer155127> Assuming you're using Yosemite, Spotlight can do this. Cmd-Space, type in your address, hit enter.

The Cmd-Space approach works, but only if you prefix the URL with "http://".  It's a little bit of extra typing, but I suppose it will do the trick. <comment182746> Yes.  That would entail extra software though, but I suppose that it is inevitable. <comment182748> This is a cool approach.  I hadn't considered this. Thanks. <comment183224> It turns out that Alfred is "free" software, so I broke down and installed it and I'm able to access web sites now directly from the keyboard.  Thanks to all who replied! <comment343611> Sierra doesn't need the http
