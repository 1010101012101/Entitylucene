Codesign dialog does not allow "accept" <body> Whenever I run codecodesign/code from the command line (or a pre-existing script tries to run it) â€“ e.g. by running codecodesign -s "Local Developer" foo/code the following dialog appears.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvstH.png" alt="screenshot"  Clicking 'Deny' cancels it just fine, but clicking 'Allow' or 'Always Allow' does precisely nothing. The only way to get rid of the dialog is then to click 'Deny', which is of course not what I want. What's going on here? How can I solve this problem?  N.B. There are no messages in the log (via Console.app).  <answer213930> So, the cause of this problem seems to be a change in behaviour of El Capitan regarding virtual events (program-generated user input events), and not allowing them to generate keychain approval. I think the emBetterTouchTool/em program is getting in the way here. The solution is either to disable emBetterTouchTool/em or use the keyboard to click the button.  N.B. Apple have detailed this "fix" in the emSecurityAgent/em section of https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205375.  <answer223676> SmoothMouse, in my case, was causing this. I just had to disable it temporarily to be able to click the Allow button.  <answer225190> In my case I did not have third party applications interfering with the security restriction. I also could not plug in a mouse or keyboard as I had no physical access to the server. My solution was to:  ol liRemove the private key from the keychain/li liRe-add the private key, with a flag adding code/usr/bin/codesign/code to the list of exceptions/li /ol  Here is the command:  codesudo security import &lt;exported_file_name&gt;.p12 -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain -T /usr/bin/codesign/code  <answer231108> Do this from the console.  I tried everything in here, and it didn't work. Tried the same thing from the actual device, and it worked the first time.
