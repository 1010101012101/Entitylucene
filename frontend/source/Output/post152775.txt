Lost Dashboard App <body> I have a 3 yr. old MacBook Pro. Current OS X is 10.9.5.  I have lost Dashboard.  Geek Squad work over an hour to restore with no luck - any ideas?    <answer152776> What's your output of command:  precodedefaults read com.apple.dashboard /code/pre  If it's disabled:  precode{     "enabled-state" = 1; } /code/pre  If it's running as a space:  precode{     "enabled-state" = 2; } /code/pre  If it's running as an overlay:  precode{     "enabled-state" = 3; } /code/pre  <comment193382> By Geek Squad do you mean a person from geeksquad.com?  What happens if you open System Preferences and then choose Mission Control, and then look for "Show Dashboard as a space"?
