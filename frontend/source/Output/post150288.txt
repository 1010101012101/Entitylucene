Toggling wi-fi on and off <body> I need an applescript that will toggle wi-fi off and on at set intervals, say every 10 or 15 minutes. I'm using a 2012 MacBookPro running 10.9.5.  <answer150307> strongDISCLAMER/strong: I can't check this (that it actually works) at the moment, but I will later.  This script to turn on/off wifi is taken from here:  precodetry     set makiaeawirelessstatus to do shell script "networksetup -getairportpower en1" on error     display dialog "The script did not work as intended, please check the networksetup command (in terminal) works on your system. It has been tested on mac os 10.7 (Build 11A459e). Other versions of mac os may not have this command available. Please open the applescript in applescript editor for more details." buttons {"kthxbai"} end try  if makiaeawirelessstatus is "Wi-Fi Power (en1): On" then     do shell script "networksetup -setairportpower en1 off" else if makiaeawirelessstatus is "Wi-Fi Power (en1): Off" then     do shell script "networksetup -setairportpower en1 on" else     display dialog "The script did not work as intended, please check your wireless connection is specified correctly. The default in this script is en1 (please open the applescript in applescript editor for more details)" buttons {"kthxbai"} end if /code/pre  You'd need to edit it to make it accept arguments (I would, but it'd turn out something like javascript)  Then, if you want the script to run reaccuringly, use something like LaunchAgent or cron. I prefer LaunchAgent, because it's more forgiving.  <answer150781> precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"     click (first menu bar item whose value of attribute "AXDescription" contains "Wi-Fi") of menu bar 1     try         click menu item 2 of menu of (first menu bar item whose value of attribute "AXDescription" contains "Wi-Fi") of menu bar 1     end try  end tell /code/pre  <answer150827>  Edit the root's crontab (by for example running codeEDITOR=nano sudo crontab -e/code) and add a line  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code*/15 * * * * ifconfig en1 down;ifconfig en1 up /code/pre  where codeen1/code is the identifier shown by codenetworksetup -listallhardwareports|awk '/^Hardware Port: (Wi-Fi|Airport)/{getline;print $2}'/code.

Include attempted solutions, why they didn't work, and the expected results.
