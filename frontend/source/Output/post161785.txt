Preventing uBar from opening folders when clicking on a non-leaf element of the start menu <body> Is it possible to configure uBar so that clicking on a non-leaf element of the start menu does not open the corresponding folder?   E.g. if I click on "Applications" (a non-leaf element), it will open the application folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vaFxe.gif" alt="enter image description here"  I've been using a bunch of start menus and it is the first time I see this behavior as the default setting. As a dwell clicking user it's very annoying.  <comment247828> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247829> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
