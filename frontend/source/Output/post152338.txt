Mavericks theme for Yosemite <body> I have to admit I don't really like the new design of OS X Yosemite, and I would like to get the good old Mavericks theme on the current Yosemite install.   Is this possible?  <answer152348> Not fully.    You can swap icons with LiteIcon but not the overall theme, as far as I know.  <answer152425> You can disable transparency by going to System Preferences  Accessibility  Display  Reduce Transparency   That may help you a little, in addition to changing back the icons as previously answered.  <comment185644> Themes seem to be like fads, and it is slightly rude that new OS versions don't give you the option to switch to previous themes.
