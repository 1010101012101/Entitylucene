Where did the update notifications for Java and Safari 6.0.4 go? <body> Yesterday my Apple Store came up with the list of new updates available, including Java and Safari 6.0.4.  Since it was late I decided to wait till this morning to do the update. Now the same list does not show the Safari or Java update. So what happened?  I cannot find those updates on Appple websites.  Can someone help me finding these latest updates?  <answer89138> h2Java Update/h2  See DL1572 for details.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpjFc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  h2Safari Update/h2  Gets pushed via Software update (and installed automatically if the system has been set to download and install updates automatically).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0l8oe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment104546> Thank you, that is an OLD update. I was looking for the newest version released on April 16, 2013. <comment104557> It's not old. Check the right side of the page. You will find April 16th 2013. <comment104559> Strange, I only see the March. 4 Ver 1.6.0_43 there. <comment104560> See the screenshot.    http://s22.postimg.org/9mjug07bh/Screen_Shot_2013_04_18_at_7_21_25_PM.jpg
