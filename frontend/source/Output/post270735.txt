External monitor and Intel HD Graphic 4000 <body> I'm trying to use an external monitor connected via thunderbolt to my macbook pro 13.   I'm running Windows 10 under Bootcamp. My Macbookpro is a 13 half 2012.   The problem is the external monitor remains black, it doesn't receive any signal   Uninstalling the Intel driver the external monitor works fine. So I assuming the problem is in the driver itself.  Also I've noticed under devices setup there is a exclamatino mark near High Definition Audio controller, and in fact I get no audio.   Is this a known issue? How can it be resolved?   Thanks  <comment340289> What exactly are you asking us to help you with? <comment340368> Doesn't the Bootcamp Support Software install audio drivers?  Is the external monitor problem I'm experiencing a known issue? Is it a driver problem or are there some settings in Windows I don't understand? How can this problem be resolved? <comment340423> Have you tried reinstalling the boot camp drivers? <comment340560> Yes, it doesn't change a thing
