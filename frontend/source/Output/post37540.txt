Is there an alternative to the native file transfer handler in Finder? <body> In Windows you can replace the native file handler with TeraCopy, I was wondering if there were a similar solution in Mac OS X. Because the current handler is not that great.  Thanks for any suggestions.  <answer37544> I recommend and use UltraCopier which is the closest I found to TeraCopy.  An alternative is ForkLift, which doesnâ€™t just handle file transfers, but lots of other stuff, too.  <comment46350> Details about what you perceive to be the shortcomings of the Finder's file handler would help those of unfamiliar with the Windows utility's benefits to answer your question.
