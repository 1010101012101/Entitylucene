How to trim .mov without losing quality? <body> When a video file (.mov recorded on iPhone) of resolution 1080x1920 is trimmed in QuickTime and saved as 1080p, the saved video resolution is 607x1024.   Is there a way to trim video and keep the original video resolution?  emp.s. QuickTime Version 10.1 (501.22) on Lion/em  <answer56596> Just trim your video on the iPhone, in your "camera roll". This is the only way I know won't  re-encoding the video.   <comment352750> Seems dumb, but this is actually the easiest—and seemingly the *only* —solution.
