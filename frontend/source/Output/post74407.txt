Organizing skype downloads in subfolders with contact names <body> I always wondered why skype don't put all my accepted downloads in subfolders with the name of my contacts!   If anybody have own solutions, share)  <answer74408> So I made a script and saved it as a folder action:  precodefor f in "$@" do     userFolder=~/Downloads/Skype/`xattr -p com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms "$f" | sed -e 's/0D//g' -e 's/.*\(5F 10\)...//' -e 's/00.*//'| xxd -r -p | sed -e 's@ (.*@@g'`     mkdir -p "$userFolder"     mv "$f" "$userFolder" done /code/pre  What it does:  ol ligets codewhere from/code field from file. In binary/li lideletes some binary-plist prefix/li lidelete nulls at the end/li licreates string from binary with xxd/li liGets the name of the contact from string./li licreates a folder for that contact/li limoves file there./li /ol  If you have more elegant solution, I would be glad to see them :) br P.S. if you didn't know about codewhere from/code filed you can find it in codeget info/code for some finder items.  To categorize existing downloads you can also add service.  <comment133707> just so I understand... this will trigger after the file downloads automatically in the default "Downloads/Skype" folder, then your folder action triggers, running your script which then moves the file into the /username(d) folder, which your script creates if it doesn't exist - correct? <comment133824> Yes, correct. But later I found that it can work incorrect with some nicknames. Be careful.
