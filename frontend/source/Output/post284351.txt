Is it possible to run OpenZFS on MacOS Sierra on a Mac Pro <body> I have a Mac Pro with a PCIe flash startup drive running MacOS Sierra. I would like to fill the 4 empty SATA HDD bays with drives and use OpenZFS to create a pool/volume.  ol liIs this configuration possible?/li liWhat risks/issues might I face with this setup? For example, how might macOS updates affect accessing my ZFS data pool?/li /ol  I'm open to using MacOS Sierra's RAID tools, but I prefer to use the ZFS file system for this due to its superior data protection and compression features.  <answer284448> Based on the links from other users, it seems that it is possible to create a ZFS RAID in the configuration I am looking for.  However for me, the OpenZFS system is not yet mature enough to be my solution on macOS Sierra for these reasons:  ol liCannot backup ZFS volume using Time Machine/li liThe Photos application, which is dependent on HFS, only "sometimes" works./li /ol  See the Interoperability and Limitations section here:  https://openzfsonosx.org/wiki/FAQ  <comment358586> Take a look at [this site](https://www.akitio.com/software/akitio-raidz-manager) for some info on doing OpenZFS RAID on macOS. <comment358591> Thanks @bret7600, does the software only work if the drives are mounted in an Akitio external enclosure? <comment358592> So sorry, I overlooked something in the release notes... am so used to just using it... Take a look at [this command line tool](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?zpool(8)). -- sorry again. <comment358593> I think that you may be able to use the reference [here](https://openzfsonosx.org/wiki/Zpool#Creating_a_pool) for Zpool on the [OpenZFS wiki](https://openzfsonosx.org/wiki/Main_Page).
