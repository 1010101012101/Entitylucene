Why is Microsoft Excel 2016 for Mac so slow? <body> When I try to scroll up and down a sheet there is substantial delay. Using the keyboard arrows to navigate is also incredibly slow. I have no graphics or complex formulas. Just 10 columns of plain text and about 300 rows.  I'm using a registered version of office 2016 (for business) and Mac OS 10.11.6 (El Capitan).  <answer250158> I believe there is an out of control process causing this that needs to be force quit to get performance back to normal.  Here are my online findings on the topic:  ul lihttps://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/40b2in/why_is_office_2016_so_goddamned_slow_and_how_to//li lihttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2016-macexcel/microsoft-excel-for-mac-is-so-slow/b6a1ff39-ec33-4d20-8093-e0cbe4abf902/li lihttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2016-macexcel/excel-2016-painfully-slow-while-moving-from-one/53463e80-ade9-43fb-96bd-904a5db3e514?page=3/li /ul  The comments hint towards too many "open ports". Force quitting the excel process via activity monitor with the most ports seems to do the job. I suspect this is a registration connection issue..  Office tries to constantly connect home and check that the product is registered. If you are offline and then go online then the issue occurs. I'm guessing these open ports are in reference to eminternet connections/em to a registration server.  <answer250191> I suggest you to install LibreOffice.  Open your file with it and compare your time to make a well defined scroll for example along 10 full pages, with just the arrows to limit human error.  The bigger is your benchmark files the more accurate will be your comparison.  <answer267571> Select "normal view" instead of "page view". This is located in the lower right hand bar. Page view seems to have issues and be very slow.  <answer270268> Unfreeze Pans/Rows, it seems Mac can't deal with it for some reason. Works for me  <comment310491> Can you attach a copy of your workbook?  (Edit out any sensitive data first!) <comment310500> There can be any number of reasons, but first, you should see if your .xls file is corrupt.  Try copying ***just the cells and their content*** to a new spreadsheet and see if that fixes the problem <comment310507> just create any excel file with data. Issue is not data related. It will get slower and slower. I believe one first has to be offline, then open the app. Then connect to the internet. See my answer below that has links to users with similar issues. <comment310665> I can't replicate the problem (Excel 2016).  I have a worksheet with 50K cells and 35 columns.  I am not seeing any slowdown and I am continually working "online" as this data is stored on OneDrive.
