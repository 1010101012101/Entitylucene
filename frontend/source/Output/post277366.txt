Everything's normal, then "No Battery Available" whenever I log in? <body> (2012 MacBook Air 13")  When I reset the SMC and the NVRAM (control + option + shift, command + option + p + r) everything seems normal: when I plug in the charger it charges the battery, when I unplug the battery meter ticks down, etc.  But then when i try to log in, it instantly shows no battery, with the X over the battery meter.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RAAGP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Everything was fine up until a couple weeks ago, when I turned on the computer and logged in.  I’ve tried recalibrating the battery, but of course the issue isn’t battery calibration (I think).  I’ve tried making a brand new user account and logging in and there is the same issue: everything seems fine up until around 3/4 of the way thru the loading bar, and then the light on the Magsafe turns from orange to green, and when I’m logged in there’s the X over the battery indicator.  I’ve opened up the case and unplugged and replugged the battery, and all that happens is that the light on the Magsafe turns from green to orange, and back to green when I plug the battery back in, the X over the battery indicator stays the same.
