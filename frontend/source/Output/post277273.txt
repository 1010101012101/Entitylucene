Left Alt key does not work properly on QWERTZ keyboard and iTerm2 <body> I am using the QWERTZ keyboard and I can't get the "@" (commercial at symbol) in iTerm2. As long as I'm using the left kbdAlt/kbd key I'm only getting a question mark.   Using the same setup at my work keyboard works fine.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K1nww.gif" alt="QWERTZ Keyboard"  <comment349014> it is ok if you feel to downwote, but have the courage and leave a comment at least <comment349019> I'm not going to vote either way, but isn't @ usually just shift/2 ? <comment349020> not for me. its alt + L <comment349021> Then you probably need to add your keyboard model & input language to your question. UK & US keyboards it's shift/2 Alt/L gives Â¬
