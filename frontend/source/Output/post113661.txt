Mavericks asks for my password too much! <body> Since updating to Mavericks, I find that I'm getting asked for my password to do every little nit-noy thing, like moving a file to another folder or renaming it. Is there a menu in preferences that will let me dictate what actions do and do not require "Admin Authorization"?  <comment133358> If you're getting the prompt for moving files, then it's likely that your folder permissions are not what you think they are. Do the destination folders' permissions allow your user account to write to them? If not, the prompt is appropriate. Fix that and it'll be fine.
