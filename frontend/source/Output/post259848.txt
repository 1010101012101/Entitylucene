Increasing quality to size ratio of searchable PDF - open source solution on mac preferred <body> I have a large PDF with lots of text and diagrams. I want to compress it, but the quality is just to bad when using the "reduce file size" of Preview on mac.   My intuition was that a searchable PDF would contain the information to enable compressing it much more while having a clear text, i.e. I could just luck a font and have vectorised text.   I found a very satisfactory first step with this answer. Now my PDF doubled in size and saving it in reduced size using Preview still causes the same loss of quality on the text. But it is searchable so the metadata is there. I guess the letters are still represented by chunks of image rather than a font.   So is it possible to substitute the image corresponding to each character by its representation in a font using similar script/open source/free solution as in the linked solution?  Thanks!
