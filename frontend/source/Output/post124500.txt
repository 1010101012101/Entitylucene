What files do I edit to be able to maximize Finder windows to fill the screen by shift-clicking the green button? <body> Is there a group of files or a single file I can edit to facilitate maximizing "Finder" windows to fill the entire screen just as other application windows by shift-clicking the green plus button?  <answer124516> Try to use an application like Slate, Amethyst, ShiftIt, or Spectacle instead.  If you use Slate, for example adding  precodebind m:alt move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY /code/pre  to code~/.slate/code makes option-m maximize a window.  <comment145651> I don't know about any specific file to edit but I can highly recommend [Better Snap Tool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12) ($1.99). It's by far my preferred solution for application window manipulation.
