iPhone email showing as plain text <body> My email service is sending out daily emails to users. The emails sent are in HTML. Some users that have received the email on their iphone are getting emails as plain text showing all HTML code. However, when viewing the deal from their browser webmail (in this case hotmail), the email renders correctly. I have checked their iphone and they are able to receive other emails as html through their phone. For my iphone, I am able to see the email correctly. Any idea why this might be happening. Also, I recently switched servers and this issue may have started then. Any help here would be appreciated :)  <comment39061> Can you tell us which email provider you are using? some have options to send HTML to mobiles, some send a HTML and plain text version. <comment39069> Welcome to Ask Different! Since the iPhones can receive other HTML email, this isn't a problem with the iPhones. We can't help you with the backend of your system; that's not what this site is about. Sorry for the confusion; this should not have been migrated here. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks.
