iMac 2011 with MacBook Air 2010 <body> I have iMac 2011 with ThunderBolt and MacBook Air 2011 with Mini DisplayPort. Can I connect them with a ThunderBolt cable? It is for work in Photoshop on two displays. Thanks!  <answer37857> To use Target Display mode with a Thunderbolt equipped iMac you need another Thunderbolt equipped Mac and a Thunderbolt cable [emphasis is mine]:     iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) and iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011) support Target Display Mode via Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable (2 m) when the source is stronganother Thunderbolt-equipped computer/strong.   Source: iMac (Mid 2011): Target Display Mode does not work with Mini DisplayPort cable  If your MacBook Air has Mini DisplayPort then it will not work. More here about what options emwill/em work.  <comment42942> Is the MBA 2010 or 2011?
