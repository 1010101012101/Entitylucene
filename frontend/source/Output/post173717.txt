Killing an application <body> I try to kill a buggy application without success.  I tried the emForce Quit…/em feature in the Apple menu but it doesn't work.  In order to find the PID I tried the following command from the emTerminal/em but it doesn't match anything:  precodeps aux | grep -i MyApplicationName /code/pre  The only way to effectively kill it is to restart the system. Sometimes I need to force restart because the buggy application is preventing the system to restart.  I'm running Mac OS X 10.9.5 on a Retina 13' MacBook (late 2013)  <answer173719> Find the PID in activity monitor then in a terminal run codesudo kill -9 PID/code and emvoilà/em  <comment204373> This not working: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/121911/kill-gui-zombie?noredirect=1 <comment204375> How do I find the PID? ps aux doesn't find the application <comment204376> Even in the activity monitor? <comment204378> Nope: it's like if it was a zombie... <comment204379> @EirNym no but it looks like it is the same problem <comment204381> @MartinDelille, ok <comment204382> Could you tell me which system version do you have? <comment204383> Then you have to kill the parent... But how to find out what it is...? <comment204384> @EirNym I just edit my post <comment204385> @Thomas I'm asking the questions here ;-) <comment204386> I had this issue on 10.9. After I have had moved to 10.10, issue has gone. <comment204388> I'm not confident enough in 10.10 for now: I hear so much bad thing about it like if it was the apple "vista" :-) <comment204389> I'm quit sure this is a bug from the OS. <comment204391> @MartinDelille on a zombie process the PPID is 1 but I doubt you can kill 1... <comment204392> Many issues which was in 10.9 has gone by themselves. I work in this OS since beta4 and have no headaches with it. <comment204572> have you ever tried to kill with `sudo`? And if there is a parent process that always fork the process, you should also kill that.
