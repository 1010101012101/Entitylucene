How can I change banner notification time on a MacBook with OS X 10.10.5? <body> How can I go about changing the time that a banner notification stays on the screen before disappearing?  I did some research and tried the suggestion found here, but am having no success on my MacBook Air. I restarted and logged in/out of my account a few times after re-entering the command with no luck. Does this command no longer work?  <answer269022> This preference has been removed since MacOS 10.10 Yosemite.  If you want your notifications to stay on the screen until you dismiss them, you can do the following:  Go to System Preferences  Notifications  Select the notifications you want not to be dismissed automatically. Change the "alert style" to "Alerts" instead of "Banners".
