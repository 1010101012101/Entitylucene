Wi-Fi only works in Recovery Mode <body> I have a new MacBook Pro 2011 (wanted the ports). I recently just installed an SSD and decided to enable TRIM on it. My computer restarts and I have the gray Wi-Fi symbol and "No Hardware Detected". I do everything, resetting NVRAM, SMB, all of it.  However, my Wi-Fi works when I boot into recovery mode. I have no idea why. Is there any fix for this?  EDIT: FIXED BY RE-INSTALLING Sierra  <answer295246> You may need to add the Wi-Fi service:  ol liOpen System Preferences â†’ Network and choose strong+/strong to add a service./li liChoose Interface: Wi-Fi and Create.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKnYY.png" width="422"/li /ol  <comment372801> Does it show up in system information/system profiler? <comment372802> Also, by enabling trim, do you mean some app or kext hack or messing with SIP?
