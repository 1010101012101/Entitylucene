Sharing a VPN connection using Internet Sharing (via Airport) <body> Internet Sharing from my MacBook Pro (10.6.6) to other WiFi devices works fine.  But the moment I turn on the VPN connection (PPTP) on the Mac (which I would also like to share), the other devices cannot access anything anymore (everything works fine on the Mac itself).  What do I do?  <answer10375> I'd suggest you follow the excellent blogpost by Rodrigo at http://rodrigo.sharpcube.com/2010/06/20/using-and-sharing-a-vpn-connection-on-your-mac/  Worked for me.  <answer10382> OS-X treats a VPN connection as a totally separate connection from the device (airport, ethernet) it is transported on.  So when you turned on your VPN, your airport or ethernet emconnection/em was no longer active.  If you want to share the VPN connection, you have to set up sharing for it the same way you did for your primary, non-VPN connection.  They behave totally separately, for sharing purposes.  <answer103283> To share a VPN connection on 10.7, using WaterRoof, follow these directions.  To share a VPN on 10.8 and above, do the same thing with IceFloor  <answer119575> Linking to rodrigo.sharpcube.com is appalling. I lost hours of my life following it. It's a totally unnecessary wild goose chase into IPFW. Please avoid. The first answer from JRobert is accurate. Here is a more detailed step by step with images.  <answer275836> Here are instructions for sharing your ExpressVPN connection on Mac OS X using Internet Sharing (uses L2TP.)  <comment10871> +1 I'll give that a try. Those manual settings for `ipfw` do not persist anywhere, right? (I don't want to break anything). Do I need to reboot to flush them out again, or just a VPN disconnect? <comment10892> in order to "flush" just issue a: ipfw -q flush, no need to reboot. <comment10902> Martin is correct, no need to reboot. If you're obsessive compulsive like me, on OS X 10.6.x you can go to System Preferences-Security-Firewall (rightmost tab) and turn it off then on. You'll may be prompted for Administrator password. <comment282588> Alas, this post by Rodrigo simply does not work. After losing hours trying to make it work, I painstakingly built a [working shared VPN connection](http://foliovision.com/2014/02/share-ethernet-osx) and documented it..
