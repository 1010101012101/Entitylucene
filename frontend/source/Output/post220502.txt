How can I get iTerm 2 to copy only what I select? <body> iTerm2 has a very nasty habit of making an assumption of what I want to copy and paste from the terminal. Instead of just allowing me to copy exactly what I highlight, it will expand to what it considers more useful.  As an example maybe I have the following command  precodersync &lt;file&gt; server.example.com:/home/user/&lt;file&gt; /code/pre  If I was to select via cursor and highlight codeserver.example.com/code, it will instead re-highlight the entire command and copy that.  It is so annoying because I copy stuff all day long.   I copy by either pressing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdC/kbd, or right clicking to get the dialog menu and selecting copy which is the same as doing “Edit” → “Copy”, on the toolbar.    I have disabled the automatic select text and copy function. That is something I do not want enabled.    Is there anyway to fix this?  <answer220632> If you do a double-click to select it go into "all-word" mode, which automatically grabs each word.  If you just click and drag it'll take whatever your selection is.  <answer228667> If you go to Preferences ( ⌘ + , )  Under the Appearance Tab, there is an option "Show tabs in fullscreen by holding ⌘ for:" and there is a slider from 0 - 10 sec.  I had the option set at 0 sec and was getting the issue described here. When I set the slider to 10 sec, this was not an issue.  I like being able to see the tabs, but do not like it messing with my copy selection, so I went with 1 second, enough time for me to copy the text without it fudging with my selection and showing the tabs.  <comment267065> Hi @Alex, well that's the thing that's not how it's working. I will click and drag and then before I go to copy by wither command+c or just right clicking it will select out as if I did the double click mode. <comment275883> What version of iTerm2 are you using, and what version of OSX? This works fine for me. <comment277533> Hi @JoeCasadonte I am using the most up to date versions.  So for iterm it's 2.1.4 and for OSX it's 10.11 <comment277534> this is the wrong answer.
