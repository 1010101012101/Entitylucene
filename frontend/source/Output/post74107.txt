Safari 6's show/reveal in Finder stopped working <body> The other day Safari 6's "Show/Reveal in Finder" command in the downloads window suddenly stopped working. Whether right-clicking or clicking the magnifying glass/loupe button, I can't get the Finder to jump immediately to the file in question. Double-clicking to open the file works, but I don't want to do that immediately with all my downloads.  What can be done about this?  <answer74111> It's caused by the Apple Events bug in 10.8. It also affects other applications and makes Archive Utility stop responding when extracting archives.  As a workaround, you can terminate the appleeventsd process from Activity Monitor or by running codesudo killall -kill appleeventsd/code (without -kill the process is sent a TERM signal, which makes other processes stop responding).  <comment86090> I'll try that when I get home. <comment86147> That has fixed quite a few issues!  <comment87534> I put it in a script I call fixevents.sh with the command `killall -v -KILL appleeventsd Dock`
