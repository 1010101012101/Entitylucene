How to search Google from iPhone Spotlight <body> When I go to search, it says, "Search iPhone" in the box.  How do I change that to search Google?  <answer11927> Also consider the excellent Google Search app.  <answer11929> If you type in the item you want to search for, an option will appear "Search Web".  Press this and it will do a Google Search for the item you entered.  You cannot change the text itself (but the above should suffice in terms of searching google for a search term).  Matthew's answer above re the mail notifications is correct.  <comment12479> OK, reading from the answer, I think I understand, now. First of all **those are two different questions**. Please ask another one for the email notification, there are ways and I'll gladly explain them on the new question. <comment12483> since I deleted his bit on mail notification, you can strike that part too :p I suggest you edit your answer to only leave the Google Search app bit :) <comment12486> @Loic Ok, taken care of.
