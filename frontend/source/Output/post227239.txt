Notes lost on iCloud <body> Took my iPad &amp; iPhone to Apple Store for numerous problems. They backed both up to the cloud, showed me everything was there; including my notes which are my entire business. I make organic soaps &amp; more, hundreds of recipes, ideas, notes, research, etc. I saw them on their Mac on the iCloud before allowing them to do a system restore. Now my notes cannot be found &amp; they will not return my calls. My business will be greatly impacted without these. I'm heartbroken. The person who assisted me at the store had made a comment saying if this didn't work I could take it somewhere they could extract the notes from the iPad for a couple hundred bucks. Please any help would be most appreciated. I'm recovering from surgery &amp; on disability &amp; cannot afford a couple hundred bucks right now. Thank you very much.
