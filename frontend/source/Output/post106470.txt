Mavericks install: "there was a problem... try reinstalling", third time in a row <body> Mavericks install worked at first. I was able to enjoy Finder tabs and such. I updated Tuxera for Mac to 2013 and rebooted, then I was stuck at an endless spinner. I tried disk repair, safe mode, same problem.  Finally, I tried reinstalling Mavericks. Two more times. Both failed with "there was a problem... try reinstalling". I tried resetting the PROM, now back at the endless spinner problem.  Any idea how to fix this?  I upgraded from Mountain Lion on a 13" mid-2013 MacBook Air.  <answer106972> I took my Mac to an Apple Store. On the next reinstall, everything worked: booting, rebooting, and no data lost.  Shrug.  <comment125030> I you attempt to install the OS again, and the machine fails the install, you may be able to get additional information by going up to the Window menu - Installer Log...Choosing "Show All Logs" may give you a better idea of where exactly it's failing. <comment125052> Did you try to [erase and reinstall](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11273) 10.8 and then upgrade to 10.9?
