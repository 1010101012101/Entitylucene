Can files be exchanged between FAT32 and HFS+ partitioned drive? <body> I just got a LaCie 1TB external hard drive and I have a MacBook Air with OS X 10.8.  I often exchange movie and music files with friends that have PCs.    ol liIf I were to partition my drive to have 250 GB formatted to FAT32, and 750 GB formatted to HFS+  to be able to exchange files with friends, can I also move files back and forth from the formatted FAT32 portion of my hard drive to the HFS+ portion of my hard drive?  /li liAnd if I can do that, would the file exchange from the differently formatted partitions   ul lihave to be done on a PC, /li lior could I do it on my Mac?  /li /ul/li liAlso, is the HFS+ system compatible with the old school Mac books?  /li /ol  I am not tech savvy, so I apologize for the verbose, non technical wording.  <answer196699> It might make sense to make the entire drive FAT32 to ensure readability between systems, unless there is a need for having multiple partitions not described in your question. As for the specific answers,  ol liYes, dependent on #2/li liThe files MUST be moved on a Mac because a PC cannot read an HFS+ partition by default and even then, cannot read without special software. Your friends would only be able to read the FAT32 portion of the drive./li liYes, your older Macbooks should be able to read the partition, and compatibility exists all the way back to OS 8.1 (source)/li /ol  <comment235029> if the files you're moving are bigger than 4GB it could be better to format as exFAT: Windows 7,8 and presumably 10 have native support for this file format (XP and Vista can also handle it with the proper patches) and it also works with OS X (â‰¥10.7) <comment235100> @JaimeSantaCruz, excellent point, I will add that Mac OS's handling of FAT file systems in general is glitchy at best, as it's all reverse engineered without documentation from Microsoft. I had to format the drive for exFAT on a windows machine before it would play nicely with my Mac and windows boxes. <comment235199> Assuming these "_movie and music files_" in which you "_exchange files with friends_" are not your own original works from un-copyrighted sources... I guess there's nothing like publicly admitting to criminal copyright infringement, which in the case of the movies alone is punishable with 5 years in prison and 250K fine per movie you copy to that device and give to someone else.
