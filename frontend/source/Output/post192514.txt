How do I fix broken dictionary on iPhone? <body> Using iPhone 4s. In settings  general  keyboard I have a British keyboard, and no other keyboards. In settings  general  international I have region format set to UK and language set to British English.  Yet many apps seem to ignore that.  EG the stack exchange app will highlight colour but not color; apps highlight programme (eg tv programme not computer program). There's a bunch of -ise / -ize suffixes that get mangled.  How do I fix this?  <answer192523> Go to settings/general/keyboard/add new keyboard and see if there is one called English (UK). If so, activate that one and deactivate English - British.  <comment229034> What is the exact name of the keyboard you have showing in settings/general/keyboard? <comment229035> @TomGewecke English - British <comment229038> Go to settings/general/keyboard/add new keyboard and see if there is another one called English (UK).  If so, activate that one and deactivate English - British and see if that helps.
