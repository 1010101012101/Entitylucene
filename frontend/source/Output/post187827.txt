Keyboard shortcut to scroll window up and down? <body> In Windows, there's a really useful keyboard shortcut for scrolling the current text editor window up or down by one line emwithout moving the cursor/em. This appears to be implemented in the operating system because it works in almost every application.  The shortcut is kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbd↑ Up Arrow/kbd to move the viewport up the document and kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbd↓ Down Arrow/kbd to move the viewport down the document.  Is there something similar in OS X?  <answer187830> You can try kbd⇞ page up/kbd and kbd⇟ page down/kbd, which usual pages one whole page back and forth. I don't think there is a system wide shortcut to scroll by line.
