Unable to send email with Mac Mail via Mailgun <body> Beginning in July of 2015, I've been unable to send mail using the Mailgun SMTP server using Mac Mail. To add a Mailgun account, I go to Mail  Preferences and under Account Information  Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)  img src="https://i.imgur.com/z9ycy1R.png" alt=""   I choose the Edit SMTP Server List option. I select the options shown in the images.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/iZafOnz.png" alt="" img src="https://i.imgur.com/TM2gFKg.png" alt=""  When I hit OK, the account description in the Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) briefly changes so that the "(Offline)" suffix is removed, but then it is quickly added back and I can't send with that account.  As suggested by Mailgun at https://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart-sending.html#send-via-smtp,   img src="https://i.imgur.com/9AeAl3x.png" alt=""  I tried sending with swaks and was successful, though I had to change the password provided by Mailgun's example.    <answer202948> Go to: Connection Doctor in the Windows menu item...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IMS5H.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then enable the log, or select show details to see if anything in the log helps you to see what the issue is...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TrogP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment246490> Thanks; why didn't I do this?! I tried this after reading your post; I'm told the username or password is incorrect, but still haven't been able to fix it. I can't mark this as correct b/c it hasn't fixed the problem, but thank you for help. <comment246619> Normally you don't use the username password of your account but the API key... Have you checked that?
