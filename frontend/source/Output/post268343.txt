macos Sierra: Shift + Arrow and Ctrl + Shift + Arrow not working in Terminal <body> I have a strange behaviour with macos Sierra.  Using the terminal with an USB keyboard, I can't make the proper text selection using the combination of Shift, Ctrl and Arrow keys.  Premise: I have inverted Command and Ctrl keys because I prefer this settings. I have always used the Ctrl key of the keyboard in any other operating system in the way that macos use for Command key instead. But I don't think that is the cause of the problem, otherwise it should had to work with the "fake" mac Ctrl key.   I'll get to the point: if I write for example "test" on the Terminal, and I want to come back and select "est" using Shift + Left Arrow, the system write ;2D in the Terminal instead.  Pressing Shift + Right Arrow, the system prints ;2C in the Terminal.  Pressing Shift + Up Arrow or Shift + Down Arrow, it doesn't happen anything.  I can't also do the word selection using Ctrl + Shift + Arrow.  How can I solve this problem? I have already tried what is suggested in this question, but it doesn't work for me: Terminal problem with Ctrl + Arrow and Shift + Arrow keys  Thanks in advance  <comment348790> I suddenly started facing this issue on Max 10.9.5 too
