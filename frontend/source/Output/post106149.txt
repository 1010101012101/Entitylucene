How do I permanently disable Notification Center in Mavericks? <body> In Mountain Lion I was able to permanently disable Notification Center, with no emapparent/em side effects:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist killall NotificationCenter /code/pre  However, the Mavericks upgrade process restored Notification Center in all its irritating glory. Is there are reason that the upgrade reverted my disabling of Notification Center?   Can I disable Notification Center in Mavericks using the same procedure, without side effects?  <answer106311> If you start Terminal, enter  precodesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool False /code/pre  and restart, this did the trick for me in Mavericks.  <answer111553> Just unloading the plist still works for me:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist /code/pre  If the plist is not loaded, codesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool False/code should have no effect.  <answer142921> You will have side effects if you upgrade to Yosemite (Beta 2). The notification icon on the menu bar re-appeared, but clicking it just makes the icon itself flash briefly. I am able to slide the panel from the right of my magic trackpad, but otherwise can't fix the menu bar to either fully disable or reenable it.  <answer144134> actually I came up with a much more straightforward way. Simply remove the Notification app which is located in code/System/Library/CoreServices//code.  To do so you first have to codekill/code the process otherwise finder won't let you delete it since it's already running (do a little codetop/code to get its PID). Then just move the .app file to the thrash. At reboot it's as if it's never been there.  And since I simply remove the .app and don't touch any config files, I don't see how I could get any side effects (but please correct me if i'm wrong).  <comment124938> FWIW: The old procedure has worked for me so far, though a restart is also required to prevent a completely blank panel from appearing in place of Notification Center when the mouse is moved to the far upper-right corner of the screen. <comment131795> This actually disables Notification Center because it changes the permissions of the plist from 644 to 600. If you change KeepAlive to false some other way that doesn't change the permissions of the plist, the NotificationCenter process is still started at login but it is not relaunched if it terminates for some reason. To undo the changes, run `f=/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist;sudo defaults write $f KeepAlive -bool true;sudo chmod 644 $f;launchctl load $f`. <comment150807> This seems to disable the battery low notifications and the battery icon turning red, any way to restore those? <comment168360> Welcome to Ask Different!
