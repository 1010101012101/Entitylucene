what is the hotkey to move to a particular desktop out of all the desktops <body> I know i can use 3 swipe left and right to move to the previous or next desktop, but I think it would be more helpful to have a hotkey to do it and not just moving previously or next, but rather to a particular one.  <answer92820> ol liOpen System Preferences/li liSelect "Keyboard" under "the Hardware" section/li liSelect the "Keyboard Shortcuts" tab/li liSelect "Mission Control" from the left table/li liExpand the "Mission Control" section/li /ol  Once there you can see, set, and enable shortcuts to individual Mission Control screens.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U08fC.png" alt="screenshot"
