Horizontal bars across screen of 2011 macbook pro <body> I have found a macbook pro (8,2 model from 2011), which has some obvious impact damage to the lower left corner where the HDD is housed. While the laptop boots, there is an odd display issue. As soon as it turns on, the display is covered with horizontal bars, and is divided into strips, each of which are vertically offset compared to its neighbor. See the attached photo, in full size, for more details.  I have run the Apple Hardware Test from boot, but not problems were found. Has anyone seen this issue before? I have opened the laptop up, and as far as I can tell, all of the cables are properly attached in their places.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1dv18.jpg" alt="Glitched display on 2011 macbook pro"  <comment359518> Hardware issue. No doubt about it. Something is damaged, but you can't tell from the naked eye. If an external monitor can be hooked up and the image is clean, then the computer, (while not exactly portable,) can be used. If the external monitor shows the same distortion, or does not work at all, then the computer is pretty much shot.
