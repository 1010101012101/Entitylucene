Where is the postfix log on Sierra? <body> I am running OS X 10.12.3. I do not have the OS X Server package installed, but I know postfix comes as part of the standard (non-server) installation.  I have the occasional need to send emails from the command line and although I can send emails just fine using the 'mail' command, I cannot for the life of me find any kind of log that shows the progress and/or status of a sent mail item.  Despite what this answer says (mail and mailx fail to send emails to gmail), code/var/log/mail.log/code does strongnot/strong exist, at least not on Sierra. I have scoured the config files in code/etc/postfix/code trying to find a reference to a log directory but didn't find one. I've even tried using the code-mtime/code option of the codefind/code command to locate any changed files immediately after sending an email, but to no avail. All that comes up are the temporary storage locations within code/var/spool/postfix/code, but none of those files are actually just a plain old log file.  I read this post (Is there any documentation on the macOS Sierra new logging system?) about the new logging approach on Sierra, but it didn't solve my problem. I've checked codesystem.log/code and although there are a few messages containing codepostfix/code, they are only about the service exiting, not about mail items being sent.  Does postfix even write a log entry on Sierra when you send an email?  Any info on this topic would be greatly appreciated.  <answer276325> This works for me:  precodelog stream --predicate  '(process == "smtpd") || (process == "smtp")' --info /code/pre  hr  h3Explanation:/h3  code--predicate/code is used to filter the log. In this case it looks for the process code"smtpd"/code or code"smtp"/code  code--info/code shows all messages down to info level, which is good for most purposes.  Hope this helps!  <comment347739> Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer. :) Unfortunately, short answers such as this don't really provide enough detail or context to help many users. If possible, it'd be good if you could add some more info on what this command actually does and how it resolves the OP's question. <comment347759> Wow! Thank you so much! That worked perfectly! And to @Monomeeth - I thought this was a perfectly acceptable answer. Zoe realised I had already tried the log stream solution but needed to use different arguments, which was conveyed very clearly in the answer. I do not believe there was anything else Zoe could have added that would have made this answer any more informative or useful. <comment347761> That's great! I'm glad Zoe's answer did the trick. :) FWIW, my comment was not intended as a criticism, it was merely a suggestion because many users prefer to have a bit more info (especially when it comes to terminal commands). Regardless, I'm sure this solution will help many others. :) <comment347821> I am glad I can help! I would be happy to add some more details.
