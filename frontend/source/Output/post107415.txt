OSX Mail reply with highlighted text as quote <body> In Mail app 7.0 on OSX 10.9, If I highlight a piece of text and then choose codeMessage/code → codeForward/code it creates a new email with the relevant text as a quote. How do I replicate this behaviour with codeMessage/code → codeReply/code?  I believe this functionality was present in an earlier version of Mail.  strongEdit:/strong unchecking codePreferences/code → codeComposing/code → codeQuote the text of the original message/code causes this behaviour. With it checked (the default setting), any highlighted text becomes the quote. However with no highlighted text the entire message I am replying to is quoted, behaviour I don't want so this is frustrating.  <answer271513> I was googling for the same problem and bumped into here. For people who don't know how to mark a piece of text as a quote in OSX Mail 10.1 I accidently found the way to do it.  You should:  ol liHighlight the text you want to mark as a quote/li liHit kbdCommand/kbd + kbd'/kbd/li /ol  The whole line will be converted into a quote.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7aoN.png" alt="Quoting in Mail App 10.1"  <comment125957> This still seems to work for me? <comment125958> Ah thx, I've now seen that an option affects behaviour, edited the Q with more info <comment125963> I'll leave this open but I doubt this is easily fixable. <comment125966> Probably can't be natively fixed, no. Only option I can think of would be using an AppleScript and the extension Mail Act-On. At least selecting some whitespace before hitting reply should make the following quote-deletion easier ;-) <comment125982> Ha, cool suggestion! :-)
