How to set up a local MySQL database for dev purposes in Sierra? <body> I am developing a PHP web application where all data is to be stored in a MySQL database but unfortunately have no server on which to upload it to and even if I did I will be working offline quite a bit.  My question is how to set up a database for free using a normal install process (I don't have sudo privileges in the terminal but can type in administrator password to install or download) that doesn't use up a ton of storage. To be clear, I do not need a massive database in which to store tons of data, I will be clearing it and resetting it to test various features all the time.  <answer294600> MySQL offers pre-built macOS installers. You can find them here.  <answer294601> What about one of the memory databases available ??  HyperSQL (HSQLDB)  H2 Database Engine  <comment371835> Those are huge production type downloads upwards of 1GB and I am looking for something simple.  All I need is something for PHP's mysqli to interact with until I am closer to being finished! <comment371838> Could I use it with Netbeans?  I'm just getting used to this whole database thing... <comment371841> use their docker container <comment371842> Why not ??
