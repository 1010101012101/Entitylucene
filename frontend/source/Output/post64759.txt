What solutions exist when apps don't download or update on iOS 6? <body> I've been having a problem with installing and updating apps after upgrading to iOS 6 on my iPad (3rd gen). When I click the codeInstall/code or codeUpdate/code button the button, it turns inactive with "Installing" word on it, while the app's icon on the SpringBoard says "Waiting".   I tried even buying a new app, but it is exactly the same. Deleting the app and trying again doesn't help. What's interesting the problem doesn't seem to affect my iPhone 4S.  I noticed several people at Apple Support Communities are affected by this, too.  <answer64760> There are a couple of things that you can try to resolve this issue:  ul lidelete the stuck apps, sign out of the App Store, sign in back again and try installing again/li lidelete the stuck apps, turn on Airplane Mode for about 30 secs, turn it off and try installing the apps again/li listop or delete any remaining iTunes downloads. emThis worked for me/em. I've been downloading quite a few songs from my iTunes in the Cloud and some of them got stuck. It was not until I deleted the stuck and remaining iTunes download that app downloads would resume./li /ul  <answer64820> Before you deleting apps just try powering off the phone and then on again - worked for me - so glad I didn't delete the 17 apps that were stuck and then have to go and find them all again!  <answer65001> I had the same problem and after none of the other suggestions worked (changing date/time, shutting down and restarting), I went to Settings  iTunes &amp; App Stores, then clicked on Apple ID  Sign Out.  After signing back in, I was able to start downloading apps again.  <answer71985> I've been fighting with this for several days now, and I think I finally cracked it.  Check your iTunes Downloads (iTunes-More-Downloads) in iOS for stuck downloads.  I had a music video that appears to have been gumming up the works.    Here's the official Apple KB article covering this:  ul liTS1583 - iTunes Store: "Error (-50)" when downloading purchased content/li /ul  Prior to pausing that download I had tried rebooting, logging out of iTunes and all the other suggestions on lots of other blogs/sites/forums.  <comment76586> This worked for me as well. <comment76856> This is a very good minimal solution, I've also had luck placing the device into AirPlane mode and then going through the normal shutdown / restart process. By getting to a good network (WiFi with good bandwidth) helps let this process complete by itself. iOS 5 had single threaded downloads / installations of apps, and iOS 6 enables many at one time and may expose some networks that are simply not capable of handling that many simultaneous downloads in a reasonable amount of time. Too many active tasks would ensure none complete. <comment81770> I declined the flag to make this CW. the downside of denying rep seems to outweigh any benefit CW would offer here. Feel free to ask again on [meta] and we can review if this is the best choice for CW. <comment88453> Jeremy you legend! All it was was a huge iTunes d/l... The free Sherlock episode from 12 days of xmas. Caused me a lot of heartache for the last day! <comment88761> SO Glad I could help.  It was driving me crazy before I found the solution.
