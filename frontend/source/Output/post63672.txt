Forcing VPN on demand to "on" <body> When we install an iOS configuration profile for Cisco IPSec "VPN on Demand" (using certificate based machine authentication), a switch appears in the Settings  VPN Settings page: "Connect On Demand ON/OFF".  We don't want to give our employees the option to turn off VPN on Demand.  Is there a way to force VPN on Demand to "ON" all the time for MDM (mobile device management) deployed configurations?  Or alternatively, is there any other way to force user traffic to a proxy under our control?    Rumour has it that iOS 6 will include Global HTTP Proxy settings.  Will enterprise IT admins be able to force this setting to "ON" all the time?
