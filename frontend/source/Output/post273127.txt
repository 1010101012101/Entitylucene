How to turn on red light (digital audio) inside of the 3.5mm headphone socket on macbook pros? <body> So apparently many macbook pro models have a digital audio output hidden inside their 3.5mm headphone jacks.  Example.  I thought this was physically activated by the mini TOSLINK plug, but recently I installed Linux Mint (native boot) on my MBP and that red light came on and stay on.     So I guess it can be controlled by software.  Anyone know how to activate it in macosx?   The only reason I want to turn it on is I think it looks cool.  <comment343333> I could imagine you can activate digital out in [soundflower](https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower)
