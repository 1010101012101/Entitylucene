My Iphone 6 is damaged because of pressure <body> My Iphone 6 was laying on the bed and i wasnt aware of where it was, so i laid down on my bed and my knee was putting a lot of pressure on the screen and the screen cracked and now my iphone is black and has lots if different colors on screen . Is it replaceable? Help!!!  <answer250361> My friend just took her iPhone 6 to the Apple Store and, out of warranty, they fixed her phone for $120. The screen was uhh... quite.... destroyed. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LG4b1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer250362> Usually if it's just the screen Apple has a screen replacement program where they would either replace the screen or the entire phone for $79 with the AppleCare coverages or $109 without it.  You could start the process at Apple's Support Page  <comment310837> exactly how mine looks
