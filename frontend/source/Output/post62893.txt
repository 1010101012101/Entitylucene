Cursor flickers <body> I have a problem with my cursor. Especially when taking screenshots the cursor and the coordinates (numbers) flicker pretty much. I can't see the numbers when I drag the cursor. That error wasn't before I updated to Mountain Lion. I hopeed it will be fixed in 10.8.1 but I just installed the OS X update and it is bad as before.  Is this a known bug? Maybe an issue with a special app?  (Using: iMac mid 2011 i7 8GB RAM 250GB SSD)  <comment72579> Are you using a Magic Trackpad or a mouse? If mouse, which mouse? <comment72608> There are a Logitech MX mouse, an Apple wireless keyboard and a Magic Trackpad connected. <comment72612> So which one are you using, the mouse or the trackpad? <comment72623> The cursor flickers, regardless what device I am using. <comment72712> Do one thing. First remove the mouse and see if the trackpad is causing the problem. Then vice versa. Report back. <comment72754> Thanks, I'll try that tomorrow when I am in my office. <comment72826> Tried it and it's the same problem. Disconnected my mouse, the trackpad and my keyboard. Cursor is still flickering. <comment72858> That’s a problematic driver. Reinstall the OS and then check again. If it works fine, install the 10.8.1 update. <comment72887> That is a pretty rough fix :-) Although it sucks I'll wait at least for 10.8.2. Anyway, thanks for your help! <comment72888> You’re welcome. I don’t think that 10.8.2 will fix it, as mouse drivers aren’t usually updated so regularly. <comment73043> Ok, thanks for that info. Didn't know that.
