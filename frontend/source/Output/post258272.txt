Applescript: activating remote application failure <body> I have an Applescript to quit my local iTunes, access a remote computer and open iTunes there:  precodetell application "iTunes" to quit  set remMachine to "eppc://user@0.1.2.3.4"  tell application "iTunes" of machine remMachine to activate /code/pre  The following error is returned:     error "iTunes got an error: Application isn’t running." number -600   Yeah, tell me about it. You tell an application to 'open' and it fails because it isn't open.  How can I open an application on a remote machine?  Edit: I have tried changing the script to:  precodetell application "iTunes" to quit /code/pre  set remMachine to "eppc://user@0.1.2.3.4"  tell application "Finder" of machine remMachine to do shell script "open /Applications/iTunes.app"  but the returned error is now:     error "Finder got an error: Handler does not allow remote events."   number -10016   This is actually incorrect as remote events are enabled in System Preferences.  <answer258800> Thanks to @Tetsujin for this link which provided the details for the answer.  My script now looks like this:  codetell application "iTunes" to quit set remMachine to "eppc://user@0.1.2.3.4" tell application "Finder" of machine remMachine     open file "Macintosh HD:Applications:iTunes" end tell/code  This does the following:  ol liQuits the local instance of iTunes /li liSets the details of the 'remmachine' /li liOpens iTunes on the remote machine/li /ol  <comment322845> idk how to fix the issue as written - but I wouldn't think you'd tell Finder to "open..." you'd tell System Events <comment322855> Good thought, but returns: error "System Events got an error: Application isn’t running." number -600 <comment323506> I found a whole page on the subject, idk if it's any use [I can't test here] - http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=19859 <comment323507> @Tetsujin: looks good. I'll try it and let you know. <comment323746> Glad you got it :) Don't forget to mark it as the accepted answer, for future Googlers.
