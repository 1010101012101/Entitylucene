Troubleshooting "Unexpected argument" error when running defaults write <body> Trying to change the default screenshot directory to a specific folder in my google drive, but when I try the following command  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ‘~/Users/tommy\Google Drive\Sync\iMac\iMac Screenshots’ /code/pre  I get this error  precode2014-11-10 21:49:43.644 defaults[2184:76708] Unexpected argument DriveSynciMaciMac; leaving defaults unchanged. /code/pre  and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7JGT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer155762> There are backs lashes (code\/code) in your path that should probably be forward slashes (code//code). You also use curly quotes (code‘/code and code’/code), which are weird at best. Try using straight quotes (code'/code), although in that case straight double quotes (code"/code) should do as well:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location '/Users/tommy/Google Drive/Sync/iMac/iMac Screenshots' /code/pre  <answer155772> In addition the quotes and slashes, it looks like you are trying to give an absolute path, so remove the tilde:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location '/Users/tommy/Google Drive/Sync/iMac/iMac Screenshots/' /code/pre  Don't forget to run codekillall SystemUIServer/code or logout afterwards  <comment183238> I think it's trying to tell you that you can't use the Google Drive folder for that. Does it work outside of the folder? If so, will making a script to copy it elsewhere work? <comment183240> No I know it's a syntax issue, I just don't know how to fix it.
