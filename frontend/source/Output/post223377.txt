Unsyncing messages/emails between personal phone iPhone 6 and work phone iPhone 4? <body> I am receiving personal messages on my new iPhone 6, but they are also posting to my work phone, which is an iPhone 4.   What steps do I take on the "work" iPhone 4 to prevent my personal correspondence to show up there?  <comment270826> Welcome to Ask Different. If you sign out / remove the account on the second phone, that unsyncs and you can choose to keep or delete the data. Perhaps you have something more specific to ask? Just edit in some of what you've tried since we would need much more detail to know what you need to learn to make your setup proper again. <comment270847> I am receiving personal messages on my new iphone 6, but they are also posting to my work phone, which is an i4.   Don't want my personal correspondence to show up in my work/professional arena.
