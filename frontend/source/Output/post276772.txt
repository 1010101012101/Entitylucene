How to install Java using terminal? <body> I want to install Java entirely from the terminal without using any GUI. Can anybody give some instructions? I know that I download it with codecurl/code, but it seems that codecurl/code doesn't play quite nicely with Oracle, and I have no idea what to do after downloading it.  Edit: I want to use Oracle's JDK  <answer276775> To entirely use a (bash) shell to install e.g. Java 8u112 JRE do the following:  Download:  precodecd ~/Downloads curl -v -j -k -L -H "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u112-b15/jre-8u112-macosx-x64.dmg &gt; jre-8u112-macosx-x64.dmg /code/pre  Mount:  precodehdiutil attach jre-8u112-macosx-x64.dmg /code/pre  Install:  precodesudo installer -pkg /Volumes/Java\ 8\ Update\ 112/Java\ 8\ Update\ 112.app/Contents/Resources/JavaAppletPlugin.pkg -target / /code/pre  Clean-up:  precodediskutil umount /Volumes/Java\ 8\ Update\ 112  rm jre-8u112-macosx-x64.dmg /code/pre  hr  To install the latest Oracle JDK (at the time of writing this answer it's Java 8u121 JDK) the various paths (besides the version number) are slightly different compared to the older JRE version. The URL contains an additional directory (i.e. /e9e7ea248e2c4826b92b3f075a80e441) and the dmg file contains a .pkg file instead of an installer app:  precodecd ~/Downloads curl -v -j -k -L -H "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u121-b13/e9e7ea248e2c4826b92b3f075a80e441/jdk-8u121-macosx-x64.dmg &gt; jdk-8u121-macosx-x64.dmg hdiutil attach jdk-8u121-macosx-x64.dmg sudo installer -pkg /Volumes/JDK\ 8\ Update\ 121/JDK\ 8\ Update\ 121.pkg -target / diskutil umount /Volumes/JDK\ 8\ Update\ 121 rm jdk-8u121-macosx-x64.dmg /code/pre  <answer276777> The best/safest way to install Java on MacOS is with Homebrew; just this:  precodebrew cask install java /code/pre  Or if you don’t have Homebrew installed already, just one additional command first:  precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" brew cask install java /code/pre  <comment348447> This successfully installed Java, thanks. The weird thing is it says `unmount failed` and the disk is not unmounted, meaning that there is something wrong with `diskutil umount /Volumes/Java\ 8\ Update\ 121`. Can you fix this? <comment348461> @paper1111 Fixed! The volume name is "JDK..." instead of "Java..." <comment364944> I was trying to install from the command line but could not find a `pkg` installer online any more. I saw that `JavaAppletPlugin.pkg` in the DMG but thought it was not what I wanted because the name is misleading. I tried using `installer` the way you did but it hung just like the GUI version. I forced quit it and used the options I had used before with `pkg` installers and this worked:  `installer -verboseR -dumplog -pkg "/Volumes/Java 8 Update 131/Java 8 Update 131.app/Contents/Resources/JavaAppletPlugin.pkg" -target / -store` The `-store` emulates installation from the Mac App Store. <comment364945> I had not thought of this. Next time… <comment364946> @hmj6jmh The question only related to the Java SDK! You are trying to install the runtime...
