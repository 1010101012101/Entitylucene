Sierra: System dialogue box doesn't allow password entry when trying to restore MacBook Pro using Time Capsule <body> I need to restore my Mac from my time capsule after a boot camp attempt went wrong. I have done this before with previous OS X versions without any problems.  There is no problem when I enter the time capsule password:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GIhFB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  When it comes to entering my Mac password however the keyboard doesn't work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WW2xP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried an external USB keyboard too and that didn't work either.  Strangely, I noticed that if I closed the dialogue box, change caps lock and then reopened it, the caps lock icon in the dialogue reflected that change but I cannot enter anything in the text field.  I also noticed that this dialogue box and text field didn't have focus whereas the time capsule dialogue box did.  Can anybody help me out?
