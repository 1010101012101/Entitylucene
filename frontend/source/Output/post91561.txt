Sync photos via iTunes on multiple Macs / Manually manage photos <body> My intention is to sync photos to a iOS device using multiple Macs/PCs.  But every time I connect my device to a new computer, iTunes wants to delete all of my synced photos.  I would prefer using iTunes. Is this possible? Otherwise, are there alternatives?  For simplicity's sake, I do not need to edit or manage the synced photos. Just want to add a new folder.  (Maybe there is a option like “Manually manage music and videos” just for photos?!)
