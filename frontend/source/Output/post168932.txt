alias command stopped working <body> I have a few aliases set up on my mac. But for some reason they don't seem to work anymore. I'm not sure why either. Even when I type in codealias/code to see my list of aliases nothing happens just this:  precodeJonnys-MacBook-Air:~ jonny$ alias Jonnys-MacBook-Air:~ jonny$  /code/pre  If I go into my code~/.profile/code script with nano I can see the script exists and has values though.   <comment198345> To troubleshoot this a bit, what happens when you type `alias foo=ls; foo; alias` ? The shell should be working if you get a listing and one alias defined. <comment198346> @bmike I got the directory listings, there is an alias.save file listed in there too
