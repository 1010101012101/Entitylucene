Opening a large PostScript image only shows part of the image <body> I have a large PostScript (.ps) file, which whenever I try to open it, only shows part of the image.  Is there a way to open the full image on a Mac?  For some context:  The .ps was created with Graphviz (by the 'linkchecker' python script), and (though I'm no expert) I emthink/em the following might be the relevant part of the .ps file:  precode"""""""""" %%Page: 1 1 %%PageBoundingBox: 36 36 404359 1121 %%PageOrientation: Portrait 0 0 1 beginpage gsave 36 36 404323 1085 boxprim clip newpath """""""""" /code/pre  (I've tried just opening it as is in Preview, Adobe Acrobat Pro, Inkscape; and I've tried changing the extension from .ps to .eps)  How can I open/access the full image?
