In app sound issues <body> So my iPad battery died, and I went to recharge it, however when it came back on, some games I played don't have background music playing, or some don't have sfx playing. I've checked all in game settings and sound is turned on, tried resetting my iPad, reloading the apps and re-checking settings, but some sound just isn't playing. Some games I play, like Seven Knights, have background music but don't have all the sfx.   Anyone know why and how I can fix this?   <comment320937> Welcome to Ask Different.
