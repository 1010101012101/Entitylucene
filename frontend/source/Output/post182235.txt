How change language of interface in itunes connect <body> I had English language in iTunes Connect, but today it's changed to russian (I'm from Russia) and I cant find where to change the interface's language back to English (Russian localized - bad).  <answer182382> Found that very frustrating too (I'm Russian as well). It based on your "preferred language" settings in browser. If you use Chrome, it can be found there strongchrome://settings/languages/strong, move "English" upper. That's it.  <comment217060> Spasibo, bro! =) <comment265248> It works like a charm!!! <comment280715> Great finding! Previously I thought it's about language preference of OS. <comment330113> йес, руссиан локализацион вери бэд, сэнкс гайз ))) <comment350806> On iPhone I'm afraid that this seems to be the overall language  setting of the device. It's sad that you can't have specific settings for Safari. Very unfortunate. Maybe other browsers can do it?
