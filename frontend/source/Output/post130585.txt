Command-Shift-Option-V in Pages <body> When I press kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbdV/kbd in strongPages/strong Insert\Choose dialog is opened. (This dialog must be opened when kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbdV/kbd is pressed).  What can I do about it? How can I "Paste and Match Style" in strongPages/strong?   P.S. 1. The issue is not stable. Some times kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbdV/kbd work for me, some times it doesn't. I don't know why.  ol liI tried both Option keys - this doesn't help. I tried this combination in a row: in Pages (doesn't work) in Numbers (works) in Pages again (doesn't work)./li /ol  <answer130588> The only possibility here is that   the option key you are using in your key command is not registering.  This could be caused by your fingering technique, your keyboard, or both. Try using the other option key and see if that mitigates the issue.  hr  Pages Keyboard Shortcuts  From the page linked above:     Paste and match style of destination text..............Option-Shift-Command-V   Possibly helpful:   to see the list of keyboard shortcuts in Pages, choose Help  Pages Keyboard Shortcuts.  hr  This may also be helpful to any experiencing inconsistent keyboard commands  <answer252870> ALL have the same problem!

Do you have any SW installed which might catch the same key combinations (screenshot tools, notes applications, Keyboard Maestro etc.)?
