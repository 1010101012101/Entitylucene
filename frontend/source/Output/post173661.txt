Applescript to update MP3 Spotlight tag from iTunes tag <body> Here is my situation. I have a large iTunes library that has songs tagged with the "Year" in iTunes.  I have a Hazel Rule for the noodlesoft hazel software which reads from Finder's "Year Recorded" metatag.  I would like an applescript that can recursively for all tracks selected read the iTunes "Year" track and embed it into the file's "Year Recorded" metadata so Finder/Spotlight will then see that information.  I saw this: Applescript to update year tag for audio files but it is not what I need.  Any help on this would be highly appreciated!  <answer173764> I don't know if one exists specifically for that case, but as a general rule of thumb, if it can be done, it will be on Doug's Applescripts
