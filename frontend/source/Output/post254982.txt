Library in Apple TV music app is empty <body> As my latest generation AppleTv upgraded it's os to the latest my library in the music app emptied. Previously it showed all my playlists and it synced with my devices. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vEKFA.jpg" alt="enter image description here" However my playlists are downloaded from the server when I try to add the to a playlist so this means the iCloud sync is working  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0Vej.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment317536> Are you running the latest version of iOS on your devices / macOS on your Mac (if applicable)? <comment317547> I was showing you pure appletv screens so I assume the screens were generated by appletvOs <comment317549> Where is the music supposed to be coming from? My first comment assumed you were trying to use Home Sharing but I realize now your question doesn't actually state what music you're trying to access. <comment317599> I am accessing my music app which plays a Apple Music subscription. <comment317672> Try logging out with your Apple ID and waiting 15 minutes and then logging back in. <comment317888> Oh right... I will try thx. The good old turn it off an on again paradigm :))
