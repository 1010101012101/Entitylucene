Why are there account aliases? <body> I don't understand why when I go to /Users/Me, I find an alias of "me", and then another inside, and then again. Can this alter the performances? Can I trash them? And moreover, what are they doing here?  <answer218260> There's one alias which you created. Opening the alias navigates to the folder, and the folder has the alias in it. Thus, there's just one alias. Delete it.  <comment264034> Thanks a lot ! The logic of the mirror, of course... :-) !
