Locating A WiFi Network Password Within OS X That Has Been Saved On My Mac? <body> Is it possible to locate a wifi network password in OS X of a wifi hotspot that I may have used in the past (AFAIK wifi networks are saved), in the rare situation that I may need to see it (to share it for example) ?  <answer96531> If you have saved it previously, open codeKeychain Access/code (located in code/Applications/Utilities/code or via Spotlight) and search for the wifi network name.  If you have found it, check the lowest checkbox to reveal the password. You need your login password to do so.  <comment113329> Thankyou for explaining that. What exactly is Keychain, I have never come across it before ? <comment113330> Keychain Access is an application located in your Utilities folder (at /Applications/Utilities). It stores certain passwords in an encrypted fashion. <comment113331> Exactly - sorry for naming it wrong. I'm using german version of OS X where it's called "Schl√ºsselbundverwaltung". I'll edit my post. <comment113332> @Scot Thanks for clarification :) <comment113333> @KarstenS. No worries, thanks for re-editing your answer :)
