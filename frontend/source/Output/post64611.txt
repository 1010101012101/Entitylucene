Merge folders is not working <body> I'm trying to merge two folders with the same name but different contents in Finder on OSX Mountain Lion.  The folder is located on my iMac and I am dragging a dropping to my External Harddrive where there is a folder with the same name.  I was getting the option to "Merge" previously but now it only shows "Replace".  I've tried holding down the option key and it still doesn't work.  If i drag it the reverse way (from external HD to my iMac) it works.  I also created a new user profile and it works fine both ways on there, so it's making me think I've changed a setting on my current profile but I can't see any options in any of the preferences.  It sounds like a little thing but it really bugs me and is an inconvenience so if anybody can help I'll be very grateful.  Thanks   <answer95542> It wont work in Mac OS if there are sub folders with the same name.   I use Deltawalker for merging folders.   http://www.deltopia.com/compare-merge-sync/macosx/  <comment110779> Here I found a good discussion on the topic:  [http://superuser.com/questions/117621/how-to-merge-and-not-replace-folders-when-copying-on-the-mac][1]     [1]: http://superuser.com/questions/117621/how-to-merge-and-not-replace-folders-when-copying-on-the-mac
