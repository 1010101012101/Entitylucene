AirPods: Extremely poor mic quality on Mac <body> Ever since I purchased the AirPods a month ago, they demonstrate extremely poor quality while activating the AirPod Mic, whilst they are connected to a Mac. When activating the Mic to record audio, it seems that both the emrecording quality/em AND emaudio playback/em quality severely drops to a substandard level (Mono 8.0 kHz).  For example, if I invoke Siri (on the Mac directly, or by double-tapping on AirPod), whatever is being emsaid and recorded/em by me, AND the Siri/Mac/AirPod emaudio  response/em will be in poor quality. After the recording is done, audio playback quality emusually/em goes back to normalsupstrong1/strong/sup. Any mic audio recorded to a file will however be in the poor quality; which is why I interpret the issue to affect both recording and playback qualities.  The issue appears to be identical to the one discussed in this Apple Support Forum thread. The thread offers possible explanations but no definitive solution or suggested course of action.  I have a Late-2013 MacBook Pro Retina. I don't have this problem when using the AirPods with an iPhone 6s.  I have tried resetting the Mac Bluetooth interface, tried resetting the AirPods, and so forth.     AirPod model: A1523. Firmware: 3.5.1. Hardware version: 1.0.0   hr  FYI: Using the macOS native application emAudio MIDI Setup/em, I attempted to observe what's happening when AirPod recording is activated. Output quality drops from the standard em2 ch 24-bit Integer 44.1 kHz/em → em1 ch 16-bit Integer 8.0 kHz/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MMhZC.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  supstrong1/strong/supemIt has happened that the Mac has been permanently stuck in low quality until system reboot, and even whenever the AirPods are reconnected afterwards. I had to try AirPod unpair/re-pair, and even AirPod charging case reset to fix the latter situation./em  <answer284099> I found this on the Apple Discussion boards:     ... they are aware of the issues and a temporary workaround is to switch   the mic from the AirPods mic to the internal microphone.   On the discussion post you referenced, there was 217 other people reporting that they too had this issue.  Also from a May 6th Apple Tool Box article:     Many of our readers are letting us know that their AirPods are   experiencing a lot of challenges while using them with macOS.  In   particular, when the mic is used, the AirPods’ audio is very low   fidelity and sound quality. Some iFolks claim that they cannot even   understand the other person when video-chatting with apps like   FaceTime, Hangouts, and Skype.  And your callers also report that your   voice sounds muddy or that they barely hear you at all.   strongIs there a fix?/strong  Other than the workaround to use your internal mic, no.  My advice is to strongemreturn the unit to Apple/em/strong.   There may be a fix in a future update to macOS or the AirPod firmware, but only Apple knows when they will issue an update.  Given that Apple "silently" released the last update, don't expect too much fanfare with the next one.  Personally, I would have returned them and/or opened a support case with Apple as they are the best ones to solve this issue.    This is not an issue with your "bluetooth chip" as per the comments.  This would be easy to diagnose - test you MBP with other BT headsets.  If the problem goes away, it's the AirPods.    <answer293066> OP here – I'd just like to add to the answer below, that I've been in contact with Apple Support.  h3Explanation/h3  Apple claims that the poor Mono 8kHz quality which affects recording and indeed simultaneously playback on Mac when the AirPod microphones are activated, is because the SCO codec then gets employed over the entire Mac audio system. This is supposedly "expected behaviour" when trying to use the AirPods and other Bluetooth headsets together with a computer, according to Apple.  The AAC codec is normally used when just listening to playback on the AirPods. It's just very unfortunate that SCO – low-quality as it may be – upon AirPod microphone activation is not only limited to doing recording, but also displaces AAC and audio playback.  Apple Support claims that Apple is looking at this issue, and that improvements emmight/em be coming in future firmware updates, but I did not interpret that as a promise to be honest. But for the time being, I'd say that the benefits of making calls and so forth with AirPods on Macs are quite limited.  h3Current best practice/h3  Current best practice is to use the Internal Microphone for Recording, and the AirPods for playback when conducting calls. Input and Output devices can be selected in emSystem Settings  Sound/em or by kbd⌥/kbd-clicking the emVolume icon/em in the macOS Menu Bar, and selecting devices there.  <comment357883> Please create a new admin user on your Mac and try to recreate the issue with this account. Is the audio quality distorted in the same way? BTW, I have experienced the same issue in the past. <comment358059> Based off of what you've tried & @oa experience with the same issue, I would guess that this is a bug in OS X. Testing in a new admin account is a great move but if it doesn't work I think the best thing you can do is to continue to update your software. <comment358120> @oa- Thanks for the suggestion – I have the same issue on my admin account. I would agree that this seems to be firmware or OS-related, *unless* my AirPods or Mac Bluetooth chip are defective. I don't think the latter is likely however. <comment358143> If applicable, please check your AirPods firmware using a connected iPhone: Settings  General  About  AirPods. Note that this entry one of the last entries and that your AirPods must be connected to your iPhone. What version is displayed?
