Saved files not showing immediately on Desktop <body> Often, I like to save files (screenshots, text files, etc) temporarily to the Desktop.  This was no problem with previous versions of OS X, but since updating to Yosemite, I have to relaunch the Finder to reveal the saved files.  My system is: Macbook Pro 13â€³ 3.1GHz 1TB 16GB RAM running Yosemite 10.10.5.  <comment374188> I didn't see this under Yosemite but I've been seeing it intermittently under Sierra. Annoying. :( So far I haven't found any fix but to kill/relaunch the Finder either. <comment374189> Possibly related to [this answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/238629/21650)?
