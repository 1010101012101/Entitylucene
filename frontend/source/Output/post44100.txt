How to Download to Computer a Voice Memo Received via MMS on my iPhone? <body> A friend sent me a Voice Memo recorded on their iPhone, to mine through MMS. How might I go about getting this audio from my phone to my computer?  I've already tried syncing Voice Memos through iTunes, but apparently that's only used for memos recorded on the actual iPhone in question. Since this was recorded on another, it did nothing.
