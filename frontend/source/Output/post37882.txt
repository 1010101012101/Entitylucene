Viewing the Account Name of multiple Apps in iTunes <body> We have several people using the same computer emand/em the same user account. However, each person has a different iTunes account.  With respect to the Apps section, is there anyway to view the ownership of multiple Apps? I can only find out the Account Name (purchaser) of one App at a time, via kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdI/kbd.  How can I get this information all at once?  iMac Intel 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo, Mac OS X (10.5.4), 2GB RAM  <answer38671> Neil, I think unfortunately it is not possible to do this at current, there doesn't seem to be a sort for 'Account Name' perhaps you should suggest it on apples user forums.   Edit: There is a similar post on the forum, however the solution looks a little bit involved: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2323398?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer91574> Just click on the app  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZM3xS.png" alt="enter image description here"   and push Command + "I", or right-click on the app and click "Get Info", or click on the app and navigate to FileGet Info (sixth command from the bottom).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XleI4.png" alt="enter image description here"   All three of these will allow you to see the account name and email of the person who purchased them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hycRu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment61586> The referenced Applescript only seems to work for media content, not for apps.
