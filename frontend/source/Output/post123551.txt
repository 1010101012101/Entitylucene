EarPods Sound Works but Remote Control Doesn't? <body> I have a pair of EarPods that came with my iPhone 5s. They worked completely fine until the other day. When I plug them into my iPhone strongemor/em/strong my iPad, the sound worlds completely fine but the remote interface just doesn't work entirely. I have looked into the apple support communities but couldn't find anything. I have tried Cleaning the headphone jack on both devices and I have tried updating to iOS 7.0.6 strongAND/strong iOS 7.1(I'm a developer). This issue has been bothering me and I would appreciate any help.  Thanks  <answer123556> That sounds like a hardware issue with the EarPods.   If you have an apple store nearby you can take them in and try a new set. I've gotten one set of earbuds and one set of EarPods replaced with very little trouble.   <answer123559> I think you should get a new pair of Earpods / Headphones.  It doesn't cost much, it should be around Â£25.00 (UK) and $29.00 (US). I have encountered this problem a lot of times, i'd buy a new pair.
