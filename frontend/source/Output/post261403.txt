Macbook Pro Retina battery won't charge anymore <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pZJM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  First it felt like the charger wasn't working, and when I tweeked the cable a bit it sometimes worked again.  But then it stopped to charge at all. Now my macbook will never charge, not even with other magsafe cables. It shows the orange light but when I click the battery icon it says: battery not charging.  I took a picture of the magsafe dc port, cause it seems rusted. Could that be the problem, and what's going on?  <comment327336> Is is just the edges that appear rusted or the whole thing?  Could you take a _really_ close look at the contacts to see if the middles are okay? <comment327388> It seems like its just the edges. <comment327395> Hmm.  So even though the battery doesn't seem to be charging, is it able to take _any_ power from the cable? <comment327534> It turns on, the charger light is orange, and it stays on for a few minutes, working badly (as when a macbook is running out of battery). Then it shuts. <comment327574> So then your MacBook is apparently unable to draw any power. (Since those two "rusted" contacts are the hot ones, maybe the connector is shorted to ground?)  At this point, unfortunately I don't think there's anything more you can do except take it in for service :(
