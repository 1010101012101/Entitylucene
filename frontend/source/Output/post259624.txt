Strange messages? <body> Im hoping some friendly soul would have the time to review these system messages im getting. Are they normal?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y7kJI.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKLJW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer259626> Yes, they are normal.  Don't be alarmed by the fact that it is mentioning destroying databases, etc. This is normal output from apsd.  <comment324834> Are you having a particular issue that caused you to look into console messages for notifications?
