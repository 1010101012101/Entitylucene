Does osx file organization works like Ubuntu's? <body> I mean, does mac have a "home" folder, and if I want to format and reinstall the system, it'll not affect my home folder? And the Desktop is a folder within the home folder?  <answer6649> OS X does indeed have a emhome/em folder, in /Users/&lt;username&gt; with a hierarchy of folders, including one for Desktop, in this location - similar to Ubuntu.  On most Linux distributions the /home is a different partition on the drive and formatting the primary OS partition would not erase your data. This is not the case with OS X and (unless you've made a concerted effort to the contrary) strongerasing the OS X drive will erase your data/strong.  <comment6967> However you can reinstall the OS without deleting the /Users directory <comment6970> For further reference, don't hesitate reading http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/4125/115 <comment6971> @Mark that's an override? Or it's delete all files and reinstall? <comment6972> @Tom The default install for OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) preserves /Users <comment6973> @jtjacques that's an override of the system files? Or it's delete all system files and recopy? <comment6976> It is an overwrite - but I would not rely on the result as the unwritten over files might not match the OS <comment6987> @Mark I think its smarter than that.  It selectively deletes system directories and applications and replaces them.  So there shouldn't be anything left behind that the os cares about.
