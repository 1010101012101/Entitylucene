How to backup and restore MBP hard drive before reinstalling OS X? <body> My MBP Retina 13â€³ late 2012 is showing the stop sign and I know that I need to reinstall my OS. I have not got my hard drive backed up with Time Machine. Is there a way in which I can backup my hard drive to an external drive using Disk Utility and then restore it back once I have reinstalled the OS (I have to restore as for some reason I don't have enough space or something)?  <answer201483> Absolutely - this is a good plan in general - having a bootable backup in addition to a Time Machine interval backup.  I like to get a SD card / micro SD card and install an emergency boot OS with just enough tools to fix any situation.  ul liHow do I make a bootable USB flash drive a Mac?/li /ul  I would do that before making any changes. Next, you will want to measure how large your drive is - open Apple Menu - about this Mac and look in storage:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUFSA.png" alt="enter image description here"  For this Mac, you would need 185 GB of space.  ol liConnect a USB drive and partition it to have one free partition that's at least 5 GB larger than the space needed. (I would go 15GB or more larger if you care about speed or ever booting from that partition)/li liErase the partition you will be using and format it as OS X Extended and name it "target" or something unmistakable./li liShut down the Mac and hold R when booting to boot to Recovery HD/li liUse Disk Utility from Recovery to restore data from Macintosh HD to target/li liWait - enjoy some tea or coffee or whatever/li liWhen things are done, power off and boot holding option - you should see two boot drives with different icons on the grey screen and can test booting from the clone./li /ol  <comment242893> Caveat: If the original is **not** bootable, there is a pretty good chance that the target disk isn't bootable either. Additionally  I miss a hint that the OP shouldn't restore (restore as in Disk Utility - restore image)  the "backup" but migrate chosen content of the target back to the reinstalled OS X. If the target **is** bootable then less time consuming tasks like repairing the main volume instead of backing up the original and re-installing OS X should suffice. <comment242894> @klanomath You rock - I will add a part about making a bootable emergency disk too.
