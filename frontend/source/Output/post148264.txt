Stuck on Apple logo after attempted iOS 8.0.2 update <body> My iPad was at the latest iOS 7.x when I decided to update it to 8.0.2 via iTunes.  At the end of the update I got an error, 6 IIRC. After that the iPad was stuck in restore mode for around half an hour.  When it got out of restore mode somehow (without doing a restore) it wouldn't boot up.  It gets as far as the Apple logo then dies after a few seconds.  It does the same thing whether plugging into a laptop or a wall charger.  To make things worse the sleep/wake button is stuck.  How can I unbrick this thing?  Edit:  I've found that by pressing the home button while plugging into the laptop, I can put it in restore mode again.  But restoring is a last resort.  <answer148269> In the end I had to get the iPad to a useable state so I went ahead with the restore.  This was a non-ideal solution, I'll be checking back to see if anyone has other upvoteable ideas.  <answer150774> RECOVERY MODE  ol liTurn off iPad/li liTurn on computer and launch iTunes (make sure you have the latest version of /li /ol  iTune)  ol start="3" liPlug USB cable into computer's USB port/li liHold Home button down and plug the other end of cable into docking port./li /ol  DO NOT RELEASE BUTTON until you see picture of iTunes and plug  ol start="5" liRelease Home button./li /ol  ON COMPUTER  ol start="6" liiTunes has detected iPad in recovery mode.

It worked for me.   <comment177447> While helpful as a set of instructions of how to restore, this doesn't actually answer the question. <comment186540> The question states that the button is stuck.
