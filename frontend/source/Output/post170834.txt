Stream video to TV over Apple Composite AV cable? <body> I'm using an iPhone 3GS (iOS 6.1.6) and would like to stream video from the Safari browser or an installed app to my TV over the connected Apple Composite AV cable. Is that possible?    <answer170891> Yes you can do it. And you have one more option to stream to your TV at $35 or even $30 when on sale and that is chrome cast. And it is wireless!  <comment200920> according to they product info it is possible !
