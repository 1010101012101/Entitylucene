Use Calendar to schedule work meetings <body> I have noticed that when accepting a meeting arranged for my work, the default behaviour is that it gets added to my codeHome/code calendar, while I want it to be added automatically to the default codeWork/code calendar.  Is any way to configure the calendar to schedule to a specific calendar the invitations from a certain person, or even better, a certain strongemail domain/strong?  <answer251439> Using menu item "Calendar" - "Preferences" - "General" you can use the pulldown menu for "Default Calendar" to select codeWork/code, which should stop new events from showing up in codeHome/code.  I don't know how to get it to select the appropriate calendar based on any conditions.
