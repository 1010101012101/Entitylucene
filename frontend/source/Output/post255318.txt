How to change default file dialog size in Chrome? <body> I use a 4K monitor on Sierra, and by default, when in codeChrome/code, the file dialog always comes up in a tiny size that I'm constantly resizing larger:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SdZbs.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried the solutions offered in this answer, but none of the answers there worked for me in Chrome.  How can I configure my machine such that the default size is twice as wide and twice as tall so that it is big enough for my needs in most cases?  <comment322558> Voted to reopen & confirm that not even DefaultFolderX can permanently resize the file picker in Chrome, yet it can for anything else I've tried.
