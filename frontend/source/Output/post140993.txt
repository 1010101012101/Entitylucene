remove shared drive from left bar <body> How can I remove a "shared" drive from the left bar of MAC OS x mavericks? I've tried all the suggestions I can find online, but nothing seems to work.  It is a drive called "psce8cef", and I do not know when I first saw it.  Thanks,  h1--Mike/h1  <answer140995> Open Finder Preferences, under the tab sidebar you can uncheck what all files or folders youdon't want to be displayed.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KmcdV.png" alt="enter image description here"
