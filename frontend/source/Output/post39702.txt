How to make the pcscd daemon load at startup on Lion? <body> I've got an obscure cryptographic USB token that works pretty good with Lion except I need to run...  precodesudo /usr/sbin/pcscd -adf /code/pre  ...each time I want to use it because it doesn't load automatically.  How to make it load at startup?  <answer48507> add the symbol &amp; in the end of the line  <answer48538> The problem happens, because securityd (which is supposed to load pcscd) does not start it when you insert your card. Try editing code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.securityd.plist/code and add code-s aggressive/code switch.  The section should look like this:  precode&lt;array&gt;   &lt;string&gt;/usr/sbin/securityd&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-i&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-s&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;aggressive&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  and then reboot.  This should set securityd in aggressive card detection mode. If there is a code-s off/code or anything like this, probably just removing it should solve your problem.  Hope this helps.  <comment44847> possible duplicate of [How can I run/stop/relaunch an application automatically, at boot/login/some other time?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-can-i-run-stop-relaunch-an-application-automatically-at-boot-login-some-oth) <comment44854> See also [Automatically Load LaunchDaemon?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30233/automatically-load-launchdaemon) <comment45601> Also relative [Automatically delete a folder daily](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11243/automatically-delete-a-folder-daily/11244#11244) <comment55573> Welcome to Ask Different! Can you expand on this answer a bit? What will this change and how will it help? Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment55650> @Georgi, I don't think adding a & will ensure that the daemon gets started automatically after a reboot... <comment83747> This is totally incorrect. The & symbol sends a command to the background and doesn't in any way change it so that it gets run again the next time the system is starting jobs.
