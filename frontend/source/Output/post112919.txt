Exclude all .git or .svn folders from Spotlight index <body> I would like to exclude all the .git and .svn folders on my hardrive from the Spotlight index. I know I can manually add them through the GUI but since they are many of them, and often new ones, it would be difficult.  Is there any way to exclude a folder by name (rather than full path)? Or is there any way to exclude the folders using the command line (in which case, I could automatically find them and exclude them from time to time)?  <answer112926> It is possible to exclude a folder using the command-line.  From there try this:  ul liOpen a Terminal window/li liType   codesudo defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add 'path/to/exclude'/code/li /ul  So I guess you can try this using xargs' magic:  codesudo locate .git | xargs -I {} defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add  {}/code  You can check it worked using this:  codesudo defaults read /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions/code  You can remove all entries (there is no -array-remove option) using this:  codesudo defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array/code  strongBe careful/strong with these commands, I don't know if there are side effects.  emI could not really check this worked for my .git folders since none of them were displayed by spotlight search before nor after running these commands./em
