Rules for filtering spam that comes written in russian alphabet, Mail 4.5, OS 10.6.8 <body> I receive almost 99.99% e-mail spam in Russian.br I'm not sure why, but it makes it really easy for me to tell spam apart from real mail.    I use Apple mail 4.5 on MacOS 10.6.8, and I'd like to make a rule that somehow catches mails written mainly in Russian and marks them as junk.    So far I made rules that catch individual russian letters, but is there a more generic and efficient way of filtering it?    Actually I don't read Russian and don't receive any real e-mail in Russian.  <answer72150> From MacHints:  ul liSelect Mail - Preferences - Rules/li liSelect Junk - Edit/li liSelect (+) to add a new rule./li liClick on the "From" drop-down and select "Edit Header List..."/li liAdd "Content-Class" by typing "Content-Class" in the "Header:" text box and then hit "Add Header" and "OK."/li liSet the first pop-up on your new rule to Content-Class, the second to Contains, and the third to charset="windows-1251"./li liSelect (+) to add a new rule./li liSet the pop-ups to Subject, Contains, and charset="windows-1251"./li liSelect (+) to add a new rule./li liSet the pop-ups to From, Contains, and charset="windows-1251"./li liClick the "OK" button to end the rule definition./li /ul  <comment83816> Please consider providing your links in context, as other webpages are always subject to change and may not benefit future visitors.
