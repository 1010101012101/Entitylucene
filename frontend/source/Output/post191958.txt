Resizing whole text containing different fonts in TextEdit <body> My text file uses two fonts, Helvetica for usual text and the ALPHABETUM-Unicode  specialized font for rare ancient characters.   The system handles it nicely, as the sizes of the ALPHABETUM characters are harmonious with those of the Helvetica characters, even though they’re  not of the same font.  After writing dozens of pages, I belatedly realized that the presentation would be much better if I downsized all the characters.  So I tried « Select All (Command A)» and « Smaller (Command -) », but the result was predictably ugly, as the system failed to handle both fonts at the same time.  In the resulting text, while the Helvetica characters are downsized correctly, the  ALPHABETUM characters have kept their initial size (20), and TextEdit mistakenly sees them as « Helvetica characters with size 1 », so I cannot even resize them manually.  Is there a clean solution to my problem ? (I am open to solutions using other tools than TextEdit).     <comment228154> When you select text in Alphabetum, do you not see that font name selected in Format  Font  Show Fonts? <comment228157> @TomGewecke Both in Format  Font  Show Fonts, and in the ruler on top of the TextEdit window, I see "Helvetica". It seems that the "downsize all" operation somewhat merged the two fonts into one. <comment228164> I would try copy/pasting the text to Pages or LibreOffice or Word and see if that helps.
