Stranger using my Apple ID for FaceTime/iMessage <body> My iPad said someone is using my email to FaceTime and iMessage. I have no idea who the person is. How can I block them from using my email?  <answer112176> If you suspect someone has access to your Apple ID, change the password immediately. If you can no longer access your account, attempt to reset the password.  <comment131745> It depends if your email is from Apple @me/Mac/iCloud.com or your email is another provider.
