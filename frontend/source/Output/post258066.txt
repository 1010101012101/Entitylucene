Spam from NY Times & WSJ top stories notifications on iPhone <body> A while ago, my wife and I started seeing news story alerts on our iPhones on the lock screen. We didn't think much about it.  But now these notifications are spaming us daily with garbage news stories about the election. I'd like to modify the settings that control what, if any, stories we get alerts for.    Ideally, I'd like to control which news sources can send alerts and what type of alerts, e.g. business stories from WSJ.  Neither of us has the NY Times app installed. The alerts may be coming from the News app, but the only settings are "Allow Notifications", "Show in Notification Center", "Badge App Icon", "Show on Lock Screen" and "Alert Style When Unlocked".  Does anyone know where the settings are which control these alerts?  <answer258074> It seems like you are not clear on what the "lock screen" is. It is what you referred to as the "home screen(before the phone is unlocked)"(I edited the question to make it say lock screen). The "Show on Lock Screen" toggles whether you want to show the notification on the lock screen or not. "Allow Notifications" is the toggle that allows you to chose whether the application sends any notifications at all. The "Badge App Icon" toggle is for the number inside the little red dot on the app icon.  This Apple Support website on notifications has everything, so you could just use that(the pictures might be different from your phone depending on the version): https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201925. Go to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201925#settings for information on the notification setting specifically.  Hope this helps!  <answer258099> The below instructions apply to iOS 10. There will be similar settings on previous versions of iOS, though the steps may differ somewhat.  ol liOpen the News app and tap on the Favorites tab at the bottom./li liTap on the bell icon in the top-left corner./li liToggle off any channels that you don't want to receive notifications from. You can also toggle emon/em any channels from which you emdo/em want to receive them./li liTap Done in the top-right corner to save./li /ol  If the channels (i.e. NYT and WSJ) you're getting notifications from aren't there, or you want to get notifications from channels that aren't present, you may have to temporarily add them as favorites to cause them to appear.  ol liTap on the Search tab at the bottom. Search for "New York Times" or "Wall Street Journal"./li liTap on the channel's name./li liTap the + icon in the top-right corner./li liGo back to the Favorites tab and follow the above instructions to turn notifications on or off, as applicable./li liOnce you tap Done on the notifications screen, you can remove the channels you just added as favorites if you want to do so. To do this, tap Edit in the top-right corner, and tap the X in the upper-left corner of each channel you want to remove./li /ol  The type of notifications you can get from a channel appears to be all or nothing for a channel, so unless the channel is split into specific sections, you can't opt just for Business stories, for example. There are also generalized "News Editors' Picks" and "News Top Stories" options. From my (admittedly limited) testing, you can't get notifications for topics (such as Business) that combine many channels into one categorized feed.  If the notifications emaren't/em turned on in the News app, I have no idea where they're coming from. In that case, the next time it happens, take a screenshot (Home + Sleep) and post it in your question to help determine the source.  <comment322523> Thanks for editing my question so that it's clearer!  It's not that I "wasn't clear" on what the lock screen is - I just used the wrong word. <comment322524> Unfortunately, the linked Apple web site doesn't address my question - how to control which news sources can send alerts and what type of alerts, e.g. business stories from WSJ.  It's possible that level of control is not available and all you can do is turn lock screen notifications on or off.  But, I would hope there's at least some way to control what news outlets are subscribed to and therefore are able to generate a lock screen notification. <comment322525> I did a Google search and saw [this Macworld article](http://www.macworld.com/article/3094344/software-news/get-to-know-ios-10s-updated-apple-news-app-with-breaking-news-notifications.html) about customizing News alerts. It might help even though it's about the beta version. <comment322541> This answer addresses generalities about notifications, but does not address the root cause, which is controlling the scope of notifications from the News app specifically. <comment322771> that appears to be exactly where the alerts are coming from.  Thanks for the complete and informative answer!
