Why does sudo ask for a password in terminal? <body> Why does codesudo/code ask for a password when one can codesudo su/code without a password and perform the same commands? Is there a way to make sudo not ask for a password when you're logged in as the an admin anyway?  <answer53069> codesudo su/code asks for a password on my system. Did you run another codesudo/code command before the codesudo su/code? Once you've run codesudo/code and entered your password, it doesn't require a password again for a period of time.  <answer53112> sudo will emalways/em want a password once, but just set a crazy long timeout -- and note that it is specified in minutes:  Defaults env_reset,timestamp_timeout=60  <answer72568> You can just modify following lines in /etc/sudoers :  precode# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL  # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command %sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL /code/pre  to  precode# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges %admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL  # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command %sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL /code/pre  <comment60662> You can remove the password by modifying your `sudoers` file. I don't remember the details, but `man sudoers` and `man visudo` will help. <comment60665> Where "a period of time" is 5 minutes IIRC. <comment60666> @JasonSalaz That sounds about right. I didn't want to look it up, and the exact time didn't seem all that relevant. <comment60694> @JasonSalaz: Yes, by default. See the entry `timestamp_timeout` in the `sudoers` manual page. <comment60699> I tried opening a new terminal window before I posted the question but it appears sudoing the password goes across windows <comment60712> Indeed, it's system-wide. <comment60746> Just for completeness' sake, it's system-wide until some recent version of sudo. Some time in the last few months, my Linux system's sudo behavior changes, and the 5 minute sudo timeout is PER SHELL. Meaning if I run a command via sudo, open a new tab and run another command via sudo, I have to re-auth on the second tab, but can go back to the first one and keep using sudo within the timeout. Just don't be surprised if/when it makes it's way to OS X :). <comment60747> This does not answer the OPs question. <comment60749> @JasonSalaz That makes a lot of sense. I'm surprised that didn't make it in until now. <comment63672> @JasonSalaz In my opinoon the hint for setting a timeout is not a full answer, but helpful for the second question "Is there a way to make sudo not ask for a password...?"
