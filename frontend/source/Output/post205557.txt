Create a .pkg file from a .dmg in order to be used for auto-install ( Casper Composer ) <body> I would like to create a .pkg file using the Casper composer but  i don't know which files of the .dmg to include .  I appreciate your help .  <answer205561> Try http://resources.jamfsoftware.com/documents/products/documentation/Composer-9.7-User-Guide.pdf page 12:  Composer allows you to rebuild an existing package (PKG, DMG, or MPKG) by converting it to a package source. After converting it to a package source, you can make changes to its contents and save a new copy of the package.  ol liOpen Composer and authenticate locally./li liDrag the package you want to convert from the Finder to the sidebar in Composer. The package appears under the Packages heading./li liSelect the package and click Convert to Source. When the conversion is complete, a new package source is listed in the sidebar under the Sources heading./li /ol  <comment247869> In short - you don't need to know which files are needed, use automatic conversion :)
