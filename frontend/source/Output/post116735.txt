MacBook Pro Suddenly Goes to Sleep and Will Not Wake Up <body> I have 15-inch, Mid 2010 MacBook Pro running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5.  It will occasionally (every other day) without warning go to sleep. I can see the sleep indicator on, but otherwise it is completely unresponsive to the keyboard or mouse pad. Pressing cap locks will not even show the green light.  I have noticed this happening  ul liDuring boot up (so it is not a hot battery issue)./li liRendering a PDF /li liEjecting an external disk/li /ul  These symptoms will happen when the laptop is powered by the battery or from the wall outlet.  Ultimately, I have to press the power button for several seconds in order to do a hard reboot.  Are there any suggestions on how to diagnose and remedy issue?

I updated to 10.9.3 and this solved my issue  <comment136540> After a faulty sleep, run the command `pmset -g log` within Terminal.app. This will provide a recent history of power events and errors. Please can you share the results, if the error is not clear. <comment136544> @GrahamMiln Thanks. I did not know about pmset. I provide the info you ask for in the question. (I truncated the UUID b/c I am paranoid.) I also only included the tail of the pmset output. Also I note there is no entry corresponding to the event I describe above. <comment136560> Thank you for the update. Sadly the output does not reveal any problem. Sleep is associated with the lid being closed; maybe a mechanical fault or failing lid sensor? <comment155594> Was just updating to 10.9.3 enough or did you have to update something manually? Your answer is pretty short.
