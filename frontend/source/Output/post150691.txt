Type a special character with a regular keyboard <body> I am trying to reinstall an iMac but I don't have the original Apple keyboard. Instead a  "regular" keyboard is attached. I can't find out how to type the "at" symbol (@). I need it to enter my Apple ID so I can download Mavericks to reinstall the sytem.  Is there any way to type it or circumvent the Apple ID login?  <answer150832> Either look at the keyboard viewer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DphoI.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UlmaY.png" alt=""  Or google for pictures of Apple keyboards:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6OARz.png" alt=""  <answer151776> The issue was fixed by temporary switching the input language back to USA, type shift-2 and then change it back to Belgian to proceed.  <comment177341> What does this "regular" keyboard look like? Is the @ symbol on shift-2?  What happens if you just type shift-2? <comment177342> Shift-2 just showed '2' but your response got me thinking. It is a Logitech K120 (Belgian, AZERTY), so I changed the input language to USA, where shift-2 gives an @ indeed. <comment177518> He has a Logitech Belgian azerty keyboard, which has @ at a different place than the picture of the Apple keyboard you have provided.
