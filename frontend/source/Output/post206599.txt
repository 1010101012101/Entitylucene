How to use a SOCKS proxy in Safari/Chrome only? <body> I need to connect to the internet via a SSH proxy for development purposes (I need to test something local on a VPS). How do I configure OS X to only use the proxy in Safari/Chrome, instead of applying it globally?  The proxy setting under "Network" seems to apply globally to other applications too, which shouldn't be using the proxy (e.g. bittorrent).  Thanks!
