Destination of merged PDFs in Automator? <body> Where can I find the PDF merged by the automator?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sbPsf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer81730> It is placed in a temporary file, with some random name, such as:  precode/var/folders/mt/k2_g0s2x3dl9jpx009p14nmw0000gm/T/JbtgKP.pdf /code/pre  In general they are placed somewhere under code/var/fodlers/code directory.  If you want to find where it is, you can open a Terminal and type something like:  precodesudo find /var/folders/ -name "*.pdf" /code/pre  But probably, you'll want to rename and move it where you need, adding codeRename Finder Items/code and codeMove Finder Items/code steps.  <comment94225> Thank you +1, the automator worked.
