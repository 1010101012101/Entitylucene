Process Flow Diagams - Chemical Engineering <body> Can anyone suggest software for making Process Flow diagrams on Mac OS alike the ones available for Windows like Ansys?   <answer167431> I would recommend Omnigraffle for any diagrams. It's easy to use and highly compatible with OS X frameworks. It also has quite large database of additional stencils here and here. Omnigraffle 6 is 99$ and Pro version is 199$.  <answer167572> Omnigraffle is certainly great.  If you want to try a free application I would suggest Apache OpenOffice "Draw" for diagramming:  https://www.openoffice.org/
