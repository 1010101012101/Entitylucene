bootcamp: automatic change of audio output device like in OSX ? (if headphones plugged in, mini toslink, ..) <body> I don't really know if it is like that for everyone or if there are some bootcamp driver issues on my machine, but:  Every time I plug in headphones, a mini-stereoplug or a optical mini-TosLink cable and want the sound to be played via the attached device, I have to open the output devices settings and choose the desired one and "set it to default". (windows 7 64bit, bootcamp w/ most recent drivers)br Is there some possibility to have an app do this automatically on (un-)plugging the cables or at least something that changes audio output device via a hotkey/combination?br Or should it change automatically out of the box and something is nessed up with my bootcamp drivers?  macbook pro 15", i7 late 2011  <answer69781> No, Windows 7 does not automatically switch audio devices.  Nor do bootcamp drivers allow this to happen on Apple devices running Windows.  A quick search on the web brings up multiple articles about how to change the audio device more quickly (e.g., via a hokey, or small apps).  Here is one toolbar app found:  http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1656534  <answer95062> ol liActivate the strong'Mute the rear output device when a front headphone plugged in'/strong under the advanced settings menu./li liClick on the Folder Icon next to Analog./li liClick on the strong'Disable Front Panel Jack Detection'/strong button./li /ol  I've got both green connectors set to headphone.  It has always worked for me.  <answer164487> you can easily set your headphone as default device. as soon you unplug headphone jack device switch to your speaker and when connect headphone it will switch back to it.  <comment81062> thanks, thought the usual windows tools wouldn't work for bootcamp driver stuff. <comment83695> I beg to differ. For the past 3 years I've been running Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro and it has always switched audio device automatically when I have plugged in headphones. Although for some reason mines has stopped doing so and I am surprised at the number of people having this problem as it has always worked fine for me prior to this. I should also add that my problem is specific to flash player as it doesn't use the built-in speakers when there are no headphones plugged in but other applications work fine.
