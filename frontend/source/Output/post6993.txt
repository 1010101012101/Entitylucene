Is it possible to disable spellcheck for Coda but leave it enabled for other applications? <body> I use Coda as web editor, and I usually have to mix Italian and English nouns and phrases. I don't want spellcheck on (as I use programming-related words such as codeuid/code and codepid/code), so I'd like to deactivate it.   At the same time, though, I'd like to have it enabled everywhere else on my computer.  It appears that Mac OS X doesn't have a way to enable spellcheck for some applications but disable it for others.  Is this possible?  <answer6999> I don't know if it's possible (I doubt it), but here's a workaround: set a keystroke for the spellcheck menu item in System Preferences so you can easily turn it off or on.  <answer7022> Just right click in the working tab, select Spelling and uncheck the option "Check Spelling While Typing"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/blY36.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment7409> +1 for "orthographic" <comment7513> Worked well, thanks.
