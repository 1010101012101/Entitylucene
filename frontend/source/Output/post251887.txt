Archiving/freezing apps <body> What is the best way to archive/freeze apps on iPhone SE (? I can uninstall the apps but then the data is lost. I would like to remove apps from the phone but then restore them in exactly the same way as before, e.g. via iTunes.  <comment313231> That's not possible. You can do a complete backup of your phone, but it's not possible to extract and restore a single app with its data from that backup, only restore the whole backup. <comment313253> It's soooo disappointing that no matter what I ask about Apple/iPhone, the answer is ALWAYS "not possible". Aaaargh. <comment313254> Maybe you're not asking the right questions? :P <comment313257> This is definitely the right question. Example: dating apps. As soon as I found someone I want to get rid of these apps from my phone but in case it does not work out I would like to continue where I stopped (including the history, chats etc). Many more examples. I feel iOS has zero functionality. <comment313260> That seems to be something the developer of the app should support as opposed to being able to back up the data of individual apps on a system level. One note, if the app uses iClpud for data storage, reinstalling a deleted app will restore the app's data, since it's not removed from iCloud when the app is deleted.
