Does Mail on OS X mark mail as read on the server or just locally? <body> Back when I used the Mail app on Leopard and Snow Leopard, it never seemed to tell the Gmail server that to mark as read the messages that I read. This had the annoying effect of requiring me to go to my web browser and mark everything as read there.   Needless to say, I didn't use it much since I would have to go to my web browser to mark it as read anyway.  Does the Mail app in El Captain have this problem? (I switched back to Windows a while back)  EDIT: I want to clarify that I want Mail to emautomatically/em mark messages as read as I read them, without having to do anything else. You know, how it normally works with every other email app.  <answer237609> strongMail in OS X El Capitan doesn't have this problem./strong   codeMark as Read/code &amp; codeMark as Unread/code affect all of the devices linked to your IMAP account.  <comment291095> Note that Gmail is not exactly IMAP so this might not answer the question <comment291116> I want to clarify that I meant if it automatically marks mail as read as you read them without any additional steps.
