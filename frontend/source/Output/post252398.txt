Global shortcut for menu item within menubar bar application <body> I'd like to create a applescript that selects the "History" menu item from the menubar application Jing.  I'm aware of how to create a global shortcut for an application with multiple menus, but I'm unclear of how to do this for an app that runs exclusively in the menu bar and doesn't have a "File" menu.   Any help is much appreciated.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OdrNk.png" alt="screenshot of Jing application"  <comment314052> I do not use Jing, so can you run the following AppleScript _code_ in Script Editor and let me know what the result was? `tell application "System Events" to get description of every menu bar item of menu bars of process "SystemUIServer"` I'm looking to see if Jing has a _description_, i.e. "jing" or something like that is in the results returned. <comment314088> The result is empty `{}` <comment314089> Replacing  "SystemUIServer" with "Jing" I get: `{{"menu bar item", "menu bar item"}, {"menu extra", "menu extra"}}` <comment314090> What OS version are you using? <comment314092> El Capitan 10.11.6 <comment314095> Running  `tell application "System Events"  tell process "Jing"   name of every menu of menu bar 1  end tell end tell`  I get  `{"Apple", "Jing"}` <comment314097> Interesting, I'm using 10.11.5 and the code I asked you to run runs fine for me however your code, when replacing `tell process "Jing"` with an app I'm running it will not compile because of `name` afterwards. This may be due in fact to some difference between 10.11.5 and 10.11.6 and as such since I do not have the latter and our code does work as expected I'm going to have to bow out, sorry. Good luck! (I just do not want to install Jing.)
