How to split fusion drive? <body> I have MacBook Pro late 2012. Instead DVD I made SSD and Fusion Drive by some instructions from web. As you know it's logical drive and looks like one. But now I need second logical partition for linux. How I can do that?  I saw several options: 1. Remove FD, split HDD (for example HDD1 and HDD2). After this make FD from HDD1 and SSD. And use HDD2 for linux partition. But there a lot of backup need to do. 2. Try to resize partition from OS X. I was try do that but after resize, SSD turn off because, as OS X says, "it's impossible to use FD now". I don't know why. 3. Try to resize from linux live but there Unknown type of partition so I can't do.  Anything more?
