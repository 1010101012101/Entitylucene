Time machine always needs to restart <body> Time Machine says 100% of the time after a backup that verifcation failed and it needs to re-do the backup.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F9tRb.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liI use a 4TB WD MyCloud and backup over wifi. The SAN itself is connected to the router via ethernet./li liI'm running OS X El Capitan (10.11.3)./li /ul  How can I debug this issue?  <comment282967> Please provide more info about your system. What OS X version(s)? How is the target disk connected to the network? Have you already tried reformatting the target disk? Etc... <comment282969> @tim.rohrer just added that info. I didn't reformat the disk though. Even though that's a lot of work, I'm willing to do that if there's reasonable evidence that that will do anything. I'm a bit skeptical. The disk itself is probably ext4, and I haven't heard of anyone solving problems by reformatting. But could be wrong. <comment282972> http://pondini.org/TM/FAQ.html is a very good resource for Time Machine. I would suggest formatting it as a Mac OS X Extended volume and try again. So both computers are running OS X El Capitan? <comment283005> I had a similar question (found [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/227875/network-intermittency-with-time-machine-causes-a-completed-verification-dialog)) which was likely due to network intermittency. Is your network stable during backups?
