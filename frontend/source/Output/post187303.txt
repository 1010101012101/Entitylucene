How to disable Kerberos authentication attempts from my client? <body> Every time I try to connect to a simple file share set up on Mac client - started with Mavericks, is still an issue with Yosemite (not server version), I get a long delay. There are lots of references to this problem... like: Why is my OSX client having so much trouble connecting to our SMB server? and  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6764545  The issue is that it tries to authenticate using a kerberos method and fails.   Here's an example from my console (I edited the domains):     5/15/15 10:39:38.144 AM NetAuthSysAgent[42091]:   NAHSelectionAcquireCredential The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.   (com.apple.NetworkAuthenticationHelper error -1765328228 -   acquire_kerberos failed user-name@SOME.INVALID.KERBEROS.REALM:   -1765328228 - unable to reach any KDC in realm SOME.INVALID.KERBEROS.REALM, tried 2 KDCs)   Once it fails, it finally pops up with the user/password prompt or allows me to select the share (if the pw is stored).   Aside from blocking netAuthSysAgent as suggested in one of the linked articles, is there a way to not have it attempt to use Kerberos?
