delete a standard account and log with the admin account <body> I have an old Mac with one (admin) account. The mac can boot without any problem, but I don't remember the admin password. A friend of mine had the 'brilliant' idea to create a new (non-admin) user and set it to load by default.    Can I access the admin's documents with this new account and afterwards just delete the freshly created account?br Or is there a way to changer/recover the admin password?  <answer60003> Please see the following Apple KB on resetting the Administrator password:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1274  <comment69042> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57119/inherited-mac-mini-dont-have-admin-info <comment69043> Also, is "standard" an admin account?
