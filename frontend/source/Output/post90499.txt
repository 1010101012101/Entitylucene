Create a automator application able to launch and quit from dock <body> I have a shell command thats runs endlessly, until you stop it using codeControl-C/code. When I run it from the Terminal, it goes something like:  precode$ /abspath/to/my-command Command is running ... Use Control-C to stop it. /code/pre  I wanted to be able to launch this command easily from the dock, so I created an Automator application, with just a strongRun Shell Script/strong component, where I wrote code/abspath/to/my-command/code. Then, I saved "MyApp.app" in my Applications folder and drag &amp; drop it to the dock.  So far, it works great, when I click the app on the dock, the command starts running. There's just one huge problem: I cannot quit the application! In fact, in the dock it doesn't even appear that the application is running. The only solution I have found so far is to do codeps aux | grep my-command/code and then codekill -9 &lt;PID&gt;/code.  How can I quit "MyApp.app" (like doing Control-C in the Terminal)?  <answer90521> Your app does start the process and then quits itself straight away leaving the process running.  You could try and check in the Automator action to see if the process is running. if it is quit it, if it is not launch it.  precode isRunning=`ps aux | grep -i "Textedit.app"| grep -v grep`      if [ $isRunning -eq "" ]; then          echo "is Not Running"   /abspath/to/my-command     else         echo "is Running"    # terminate code  here     fi; /code/pre  So when you click the App in the Dock. to will either start the process or stop it.  <answer90548> Opening an Automator application starts a process named codeApplication Stub/code, but codekillall Application\ Stub/code doesn't terminate its child processes.  precode$ sleep 1 &amp;&amp; open ~/Desktop/Untitled.app/ &amp; sudo execsnoop [1] 650   UID    PID   PPID ARGS   501    655    650 open   501    656    143 Application Stub   501    657    143 Automator Launch   501    658    656 bash   501    658    656 say /code/pre  codepkill -P $(pgrep Application\ Stub)/code and codekillall say/code made Automator show a dialog that the workflow encountered an error.  If you used an AppleScript application instead, it could be terminated from the Dock or with codekillall applet/code.  Or if you don't want to keep a shell window open, use disown or launchctl submit:  precodesay {1..99} &amp; disown $! # stop with killall say launchctl submit -l my.say say {1..99} # stop with launchctl remove my.say /code/pre  <comment106275> How do I quit it?
