Why is "Devices" under bluetooth greyed out? <body> I only see an option that allows me to select coded8-30-62-42-10-25/code. Why is that? How can I connect to my other bluetooth devices?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XEHwT.png" alt="https://infinit.io/_/wTs5aZx"  <answer213665> The label "Devices" is always grayed out, if that's what you're asking. Just like "Bluetooth: on" is grayed out. But here's what you can do to connect.  1.) Click the bluetooth icon in the menu bar while pressing the option key: ‚å• + click.  2.) Hover the mouse over the device that you want to connect, and click remove. This should refresh any old bluetooth logs.  3.) Then connect again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NOM3b.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
