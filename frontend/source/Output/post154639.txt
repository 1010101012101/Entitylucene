Screen Sharing stops working (10.9 and 10.10) <body> I am running a MacMini (late 2012) with OS X 10.9.5 Server as a media server connected to a TV via HDMI. The Mac ist mostly used as a Plex Server/Player and a SickBeard client (running on Python - GitHub install).   Screen Sharing, SSH and Remote Management are enabled and everything has been working flawlessly - until recently.  Since a couple of weeks (unfortunately I am not able to tie the time to any software update/change event), Screen Sharing, SSH and Server App both stopped working - usually after 1-2 hours after system startup. They all time out when trying to connect.   All other system services continue to work (File Sharing, TimeMachine Server, Plex, Sickbeard)  ul liI have tried several VNC/Management clients to connect: OS X ScreenSharing, Apple Remote Desktop, Screens.app and Apple Server.app. All of them connect fine initially and then fail/time out after trying to connect 1-2 hours later./li liI have switched Remote Management and BackToMyMac (iCloud) settings on/off several times/li liI re-installed 10.9.5 Update Combo/li liin a completely desperate move, I even tried moving to Yosemite (after SuperDuper'ing my boot drive)/li /ul  The only (temporary) fix is to restart the Mac. Everything works just fine then - until after 1-2 hours...  What am I missing?  Thank you.  <comment185270> http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203048 says to disable and then enable screen sharing again. But there is nothing about it failing after a couple hours run time. My system that is 10.9.4 is not accessible from a 10.9.5 system, but can be accessed from app Easy Connect running on iOS device.
