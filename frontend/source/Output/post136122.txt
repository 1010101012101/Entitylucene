How to change to workspace on non-active monitor? <body> I have multiple workspaces. I can switch them via kbdCtrl/kbd + Arrow Keys Left and Right.  I also have multiple monitor setup. I realized I can only switch this way on the current, active monitor. How do I change the active monitior?  <comment161390> That awkward moment when you notice that you asked the same question before. http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/132143/53299 <comment161403> so why are you asking it again ? <comment161405> @Buscarì›ƒ By mistake. I want to keep the duplicate though if someone else searches for the same question. Yet somebody should close one as a duplicate.
