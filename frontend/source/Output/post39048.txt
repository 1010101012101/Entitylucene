How do I add subtitles to a DVD? <body> I have to do a translation of the words of a DVD, and then add subtitles to that DVD (iso file or folder).  This is a professional work and it has to be clean (no change in quality, ie no "rip"...).  How can I add subtitles to a DVD (file) on a Mac (snow leopard)?  ul liwysiwyg: being able to view the DVD / stop it to add the subtitle, set the duration easily/li liif possibly, set the font, size and position of subtitles/li li(if possibly, even add subtitles to the DVD Menu)/li /ul  Is there already an App on the Mac that does that and just need a download? Or a 3rd party software is required?  <answer39052> Final Cut Pro can do that.  So can DVD Studio Pro.  There are also some free alternatives, most notable: Aegisub and Jubler.  <answer39065> I would go with DVD Studio Pro.  Basically, you create a subtitle clip and position it:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kD85r.png" alt="subtitle clip dvdsp"br Click the textarea in the Inspector, and start typing. You can format the font by bringing up the Fonts window by going to Format  Font  Show Fonts (or pressing kbdCommand/kbd + kbdT/kbd). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WwFUp.png" alt="Font window"br And that's the basic idea. Pretty simple. You can find a little more detailed article in Apple's KB.  <comment44210> DVD Studio Pro is really the way to go. +1 <comment44269> Great example of using DVD Studio Pro! <comment44310> @Vlad Thanks! However your answer pushed me to get *this* answer up. <comment46224> DVD Studio Pro seems to be discontinued. Is there a way to get a clean and safe version? (legally) <comment46408> @ring0 - DVD Studio Pro is now being sold as part of Final Cut Pro. <comment51495> @ring0 Actually, Final Cut Studio is "discontinued". Apple was still selling it via phone last time I checked, but I'm not sure that they still are. <comment51751> @daviesgeek thanks - FCP does *not* do that, FCS (and DVD SP) are discontinued :-(
