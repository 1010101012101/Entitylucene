Use early 2009 20" iMac as external display for 2015 rMBP <body> I wanted to use a mini display-port cable then use "target display mode" to make the iMac an external display, but I just read that early 2009 iMac's don't have target display mode as a feature.  Anybody knows of a solution?  <answer267194> This cannot be done with your particular iMac (2009 20")  Per the Target Display Mode System Requirements Page it specifically says:     A supported iMac with OS X v10.6.1 or later.   The supported iMacs are:     ul   liiMac (27-inch Late 2009)/li   liiMac (27-inch Mid 2010)/li   liiMac (Mid 2011)/li   liiMac (Mid 2012-Mid 2014)/li   /ul   However, there is an App that allows you to turn a spare Mac into an extended monitor.  It's called Air Display.  This is emnot/em my ideal solution as video intensive applications don't perform well with software solutions.  If you need a secondary monitor, you may have to get a dedicated monitor to meet your needs
