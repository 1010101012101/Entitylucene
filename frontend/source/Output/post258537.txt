How do you unsplit two Iterm2 panes into two seperate tabs with keyboard? <body> So I've seen solutions online about how to unsplit two-pane Iterm2 setups as such:  http://www.xenabeast.com/solution-un-split-itermiterm2-window/ http://azaleasays.com/2014/03/05/iterm2-merge-a-pane-back-to-window-or-tab-bar/  But given that iTerm2 is geared towards keyboard shortcuts, has anyone figured out a way to do this with keys?  Thanks!
