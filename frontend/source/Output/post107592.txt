Is it possible to get via CLI the commercial name (Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks, ...) <body> At the moment I'm using both codeuname/code and codesw_vers/code  precodedarwin_version=`uname -r` osx_version=`sw_vers -productVersion` /code/pre  But if I want to display the commercial name (Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks, ...) I have to manually maintain a list of osx version - commercial name pair.  I'd like to avoid that manual mapping and rely on emsystem data/em. Is it possible ?  <answer108016> Well as you said it : it's a commercial name and it's barely present in the OS it self. It no real wonder, it has no meaning for devs (far less than a version or a build number).   AFAIK It's mentioned in some help pages, but that's almost all.  So until someone would prove me wrong, there is no CLI for that (excluding codecurl/code stuff, which would imho not be a suitable option here).  <comment126161> When I see commands like `system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType` I'm not sure it's really possible. <comment126164> Yeah I've looked at `system_profiler` as well, and that got me desperate, that's why I'm asking here. But I fear too it's not possible. <comment126749> Yes that's what I fear! For the eycandy of my script I'd like to display the commercial name, I'm a bit sad there's isn't a property somewhere for that ;) <comment127227> When I see the count of upvotes for your question (mine is included) you're not the only one ;)
