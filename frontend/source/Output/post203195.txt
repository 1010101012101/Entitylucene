How do I unsync all apple devices for text? <body> How do I unsync my iphone messages so that those do not go to my ipad.  I have unclicked the email address associated with my ipad on my iphone.   Is there something else I need to do so other people in the house do not see my text messages on the ipad?  <answer203209> You want to (on your iPhone) open Settings, then go to strongMessages - Text Message Forwarding/strong, then uncheck your iPad  <comment245173> I don't see an option on my iphone 5S under messages for **Text Message Forwarding**. I see Send & Receive. <comment246182> It's there. Go to http://www.aoole.com/ios/messages/ for more info. <comment246673> Are you asking if changing the password on your AppleID will prevent all devices from receiving iMessage going forward?
