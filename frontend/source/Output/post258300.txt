How to copy part of a text, iOS10 <body> In iOS 10 Apple added the ability to react to messages (“tapback”). You can give a thumbs up, a heart, laughter, etc. You do so by tapping and holding the message and then tapping your reaction when the options pop up.  Before iOS 10, though, tapping and holding a message allowed you to select part of the message, just like tapping and holding text most anywhere else on the iPhone.  Is it still possible to partially copy text from an iMessage or SMS? If yes, how do we do so?  <answer258304> In iOS 10, you can only copy an entire message. You may then edit it upon pasting.  When the Tapback options show up after long-pressing a message, you get the option to strongCopy/strong at the bottom of the screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z1ZMN.jpg" alt="Text Options"  Tapping strongMore…/strong lets you select multiple messages to strongDelete/strong or strongForward/strong.  <answer258305> No, it's not possible with a non-jailbroken iOS 10.  You can select the entire message to copy first and then after you paste you can edit the text.  <answer273279> Best way is to select "forward" then you can select part of the message to copy. Apple should fix this though.  <answer281968> Easiest solution I found was to copy the entire bubble, then paste it into the text area to send, and in that area you can select just the single word or portion you want like normal text.  Once selected and copied, just delete the message and don't send it.  <comment322874> Wow did I really make this up? I am pretty sure that you could and that it was useful for voting addresses especially. But maybe I imagined it all <comment322875> To the best of my recollection, long-pressing has always selected the entire bubble. <comment345915> @Unrelated you didn't imagine it. iOS 8 definitely allowed you to copy part of a message. I know cause I only recently upgraded <comment346039> @huyz thanks! My sanity Augusta the confirmation <comment354936> Forward?  This isn't about emails, it's about text messages... there is no forward AFAIK.
