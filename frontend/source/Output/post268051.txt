Open CSV File with Different Separator <body> I'm currently using the default Numbers application to open my CSVs. My current use case involves a file that I had to use a different type of separator (code|/code). Is there any way to change the separator? Right now when I open the file it just puts the entire row in one column.  <answer268053> Use codesed/code;  the strongS/strongtream strongED/strongitor from Terminal.    codesed -i -e 's/"|"/|,"/g' filename/code  codes/code is used to replace the found expression "|" with ","  codeg/code is for "global", emmeaning  do this to the whole line/em. If you omit the codeg/code option it will only replace the first instance, ignoring the rest  code-i/code option is to "edit in place" meaning it changes the file itself.  code-e/code option indicates the expression/command to run.  <comment336428> While this is very helpful if I were to convert the format, it does not help my current use case. I'm asking specifically to be able to use a different separator because my data contains commas. Thanks though, love how you explained what each part of the command helps do (plus I hadn't heard of sed before) <comment336432> It's not converting the format, it's still a CSV except that it's using a different separator character <comment336433> That's what I meant by format. The separator is the problem here <comment336435> That's a limitation of Numbers.  The only option is to work with your data as a CSV file then covert the separators using `sed` through Terminal or use [Excel Online](https://office.live.com/start/Excel.aspx) to save it as a CSV with your preferred format.
