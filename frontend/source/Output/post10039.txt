Is it possible to connect a single Dropbox Mac app with two or more Dropbox accounts? <body> Is it possible to connect a single Dropbox Mac app with two or more Dropbox accounts?  Assume I have corporate and private account. How can I use a single dropbox app for them?  <answer10041> You can't do it out of one copy of the app, but it seems that you can duplicate the app. You can see (somewhat complicated) instructions here:  http://maketecheasier.com/run-multiple-dropbox-accounts-in-mac-and-linux/2010/05/24  I haven't done this personally, but this looks like it should work.  <answer91157> You can simply do that using multiple OS X accounts, running the same copy of Dropbox in each of them.  <answer91208> I do this with one copy of Dropbox. For my secondary account, I run an automator script on login that sets:  codeHOME=$HOME/Desktop/SECONDARY-DROPBOX /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox &amp;/code  I end up with two dropbox icons in the menu bar. I configure one to be alternate black/white icon so I can distinguish visibly between the two.  <answer138988> My (less complicated?) fix to this was...  I have two Mac accounts:  Robert, Corp a/c Bob, Personal a/c  Dropbox installed on both Accounts synching to   precode/Volumes/Working/Websync/Robert/Dropbox /Volumes/Working/Websync/Bob/Dropbox /code/pre  From a Terminal window in the Bob account  precodebob$&gt;su Robert -c /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox /code/pre  You'll be prompted for password for Robert  Dropbox will run something like  precode/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python27.zip /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7 /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/plat-darwin /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/plat-mac /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/plat-mac/lib-scriptpackages /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/lib-tk /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/lib-old /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload /code/pre  Open a new terminal shell 'Cmd-T' and then run Dropbox for Bob  precodebob$&gt; /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox /code/pre  I'm running Dropbox v2.8.2 on Mountain Lion  Thanks to Mark for his answer to this Can I start an application as another user without actually switching users?  Image: Two Dropbox Accounts running  <comment10529> It is a somewhat complicated process. Multiple simultaneous different dropbox accounts is a [feature very well requested](https://www.dropbox.com/votebox/118/multiple-accounts) that must come along eventually. So second option is waiting. <comment10588> I seriously doubt it will ever happen. Dropbox makes their revenue from selling upgraded accounts with more storage. If they started letting people have multiple free accounts, their revenue will drop. <comment10639> what if the multiple account feature isn't free? Anyway, there must be a model that works.
