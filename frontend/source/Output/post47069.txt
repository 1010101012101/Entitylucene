AppleTV Remote Shortcut to Sleep <body> I have a 2nd gen AppleTV unit. I would like to know if there is a way to use the AppleTV remote to put the unit to sleep (e.g. hold a key down)?  Currently, the only way I know to do this is to traverse the menus back out to Settings, and then select Sleep Now.   <answer47070> Hold down the main centre button. Should put it to sleep after a couple of seconds.  Hit it again to wake it up.  <comment53927> Fantastic. I just tried this (same AppleTV) and it worked. Never knew that. Thanks Alex.
