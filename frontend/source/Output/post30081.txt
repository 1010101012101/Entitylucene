Why is my computer name new-host-2.home on the network? <body> I configured my computer name to "Macbook of Matthieu" in the network sharing preferences.  However, this name end up being used: codenew-host-2.home/code, how can I change that?  <answer30086> Go to System Preferences, then the Sharing Pane. You can change the name of the computer there.   This sometimes happens when a new computer replaces an old one, or a new version of an OS is installed.  Hope this helps.  <answer30122> The ".home" domain sounds like it might be something your router is providing. Check your router's settings for a DNS server configuration. If you want to use the Bonjour/mDNS ".local" names, then turn off the router's DNS server, or tell it to act only as a proxy for your ISP's DNS service.  <answer69766> If you are looking at the shared Mac from a Windows machine, the discovery is done through Microsoft Network, which uses NetBIOS layer to get the name of the hosts. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS  The NetBIOS name is set up in OS X from the Network Properties panel, as shown in the image bellow.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t45WQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  If, you are having issues with the name seen under OS X, than you might have a synchronisation name problem, as described in the topic bellow: Why does my iMac have one name under sharing, but then say &#39;new-host3.home&#39; as well?  <answer288565> If your able to find the mac then you wil see its your own the answer you find her: whatismyipaddress.com/ipv4-partsimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziAAA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  As you see the mac's are al the same as one of my pc's You can copy past it in macvendor to find whitch pc  <comment34513> Yes that is what I did (see my question). However it still is `new-host-2.home`. I'll try to restart. <comment81039> Sounds like a DHCP generated name.
