iMessage and FaceTime not working after changing apple id <body> Last time I got macbook and iphone from my brother. These devices were always connected with one apple id. I wanted to keep all apps and settings, so I did not create new apple id, I've just changed password, email, name of current apple id, so now it is only mine, not my broter's.  And I don't know why, but imessage and facetime not working, on both devices. I can log in icloud, and everything if fine, but when I'm trying to log in on imessage or face time this appears :      "An error occurred during activation"   Before change everything worked. I have tried almost everything. Please help.  <answer259248> it's hard to tell what could be the problem without knowing what happed exactly.

If that wasn't help I suggest to contact apple support team.  https://support.apple.com/en-lk/HT201422  <comment324288> Thank You, but I have tried all of this.
