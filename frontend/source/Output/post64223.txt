My iphone 4s's sound settings changed by themselves <body> I didn't touch my phones settings, and all of a sudden (3 days ago roughly) my phone is making a sound when I get a text message, or login to my phone (entering the password), and receiving text messages etc.  Previously, my phone always vibrated for phone calls, and receiving text messages.  Sending text messages made no sound at all, nor did entering my password to unlock the phone.  How could this have happend?  My battery didn't die or anything.  And I can't seem to get those settings back anymore.  ol liI have (Silent) vibrate set to ON/li liI have vibrate set to ON/li lilock sounds and keyboard sounds are both set to OFF/li /ol  <answer64255> Try hard rebooting the phone - hold down sleep/wake and the home button until you see the red slider below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wXaWk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Once the phone is powered off, give it 5 seconds, then hold down the sleep/wake until it turns back on and let it finish booting up.  <answer100389> Please verify the position of the upper left switch on the housing. Slide it down so that you can see the orange background. This setting mutes your iPhone. You will then hear no system sounds, only vibration.  I assume you always had that switch in that position and it accidently changed its postion to unmute.  <comment75519> what is that suppose to do? <comment75560> It reboots the phone.  You said you haven't changed anything, and verified the settings haven't changed, but you're getting different behavior.  So reboot it, and see if it gets better.  If not, more diagnosis is needed.
