Automatic download of top apps from iTunes App Store in iTunes <body> Is there a script or other way to have iTunes download the top (free) apps (in all categories, or specific category) from the app store, like once a week or day?  <answer130583> h1“/h1     Is there a script... to have iTunes download the top (free) apps (in all categories, or specific category) from the app store, like once a week or day?   h1”/h1  No. But its a really neat idea. And iTunes is very very scriptable.  hr  h1“/h1     Is there a... other way to have iTunes download the top (free) apps (in all categories, or specific category) from the app store, like once a week or day?   h1”/h1  Yes, its called AppleScript, and it is the language of iTunes automation.   hr  Unfortunately, it appears the #applescript@freenode.irc channel is quite dead (which says more about irc than AppleScript!), but there are still some great online and offline resources available.   I found a very nice tutorial for beginners to get you started.  <comment168091> After all, I don't think there is enough scriptability within the iTunes application. Do you have a concrete example or is there any other way? <comment168093> Here is a related question. http://stackoverflow.com/q/22424270/129202
