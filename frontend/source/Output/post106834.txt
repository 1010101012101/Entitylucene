How do I install JDK 1.6 in Mavericks? <body> When I upgrade to Mavericks, it uninstalls Java 1.6. I can install Java 7, but for some applications and development work, I still need access to Java 6. How can I reinstall Java 6 in Mavericks?  Apple docs generally recommend downloading Java directly from Oracle, but I don't see a Mac version listed on the Oracle download page for Java SE 6.  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html#jdk-6u45-oth-JPR  strongUpdate/strong  I was able to install parts of Java 6, with an Apple Support update. But Maven is still missing.  precode$ specs java os Specs:  specs 0.7 https://github.com/mcandre/specs#readme  mvn --version mvn not found  echo $CLASSPATH   echo $JAVA_HOME /Library/Java/Home  javac -version javac 1.6.0_65  java -version java version "1.6.0_65" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-462, mixed mode)  system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType | grep 'System Version'       System Version: OS X 10.9 (13A603) /code/pre  strongUpdate 2/strong  I was able to install Maven with Homebrew:  precode$ brew install maven $ mvn --version Apache Maven 3.1.1 (0728685237757ffbf44136acec0402957f723d9a; 2013-09-17 11:22:22-0400) Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.1.1/libexec Java version: 1.6.0_65, vendor: Apple Inc.

Here's the steps I took to get Maven setup on a fresh install of Mavericks:  precodecurl -O http://apache.tradebit.com/pub/maven/maven-3/3.1.1/binaries/apache-maven-3.1.1-bin.tar.gz sudo mkdir /usr/local cd /usr/local sudo tar -xf ~/apache-maven-3.1.1-bin.tar.gz echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/apache-maven-3.1.1/bin" &gt;&gt; .profile echo "export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home" &gt;&gt; .profile /code/pre  <answer119628> When I tried the accepted answer, I didn't see the new JDK 1.6 in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/  I had to go to https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ search for "java", download the latest, and install that. Then the JDK 1.6 appeared.  <answer210506> This works on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). I've used Homebrew to install JDK 1.6.0_65:  precodebrew tap caskroom/versions brew cask install java6 /code/pre  <comment125376> Does that include the JDK, with `javac` and `mvn`, or just the JRE? <comment125384> This maybe helpful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19533528/installing-java-on-osx-10-9-mavericks <comment125386> @apennebaker I didn't think Maven was part of the JDK? <comment139531> If you're using multiple version of the JDK on the Mac you'll want to know about `java_home`. e.g. `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7)` <comment139540> Jave 6 will install at `/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk` by default - the one you have downloaded from the developer site, is a developer version, and will - as you have noticed - install under `/Library/Java/...` <comment144730> This answer gave me the missing piece to compiling JNI applications on Mavericks.  Most other discussions, particularly on SO, point people to `http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572` but that does not provide a JDK.  The information in this answer led me to the correct item.  So, thank you, very much. <comment189750> link is dead, fyi.. <comment256250> FYI, this downloads from the same apple support page [linked by Colin C.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/106836/87027) <comment262527> This proved to be of limited value as the end result was to stage the .pkg file, which was identical to directly downloading from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572.  Guess, it is handy for new users to brew cask. thanks for the suggestion all the same. <comment357997> @arcseldon installing through Homebrew Cask makes it easy to update and uninstall JDK 1.6, though.
