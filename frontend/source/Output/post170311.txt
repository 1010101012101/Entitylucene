iCloud Drive and external hard drives <body> I have just added a second hard drive to my mac mini and would love to use the new partition to store files on iCloud Drive. emSince they are on the cloud, it would clear some room on my back up./em   Is there a way to have files on this new drive show up in iCloud Drive, maybe with hard links? I am not sure how to use hard links in a situation like this, or if it would work.   <comment214166> If it's just about the backup for you, why not just exclude it in system preferences  timemachine <comment214524> It is not completely about the backup, more about achieving the elegance of other cloud services and using all of the abilities of the MacOS. <comment214570> I'm supposing iCloud Drive just depends on the folder-location so a hard link could probably work, but I have never tried myself. Also, iCloud will might go completely mad when the hard-drive is not connected
