Where does SFTPD log to? <body> I have enabled logging in SFTPD by adding including the following in my code/etc/sshd_config/code  precodesubsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server -l DEBUG /code/pre  But I can't find any log files. Where does sftp log on OS X v10.9.2 ?  <answer129377> On my machine, (10.9.2) changing the log level for the sftp server in sshd just makes everything spit out onto code/var/system.log//code along with the rest of sshd's log output.  e.g. part of my system.log filtered for 'sftp' after a single connect  precodeMay  1 19:57:55 joes-imac.local sshd[50141]: subsystem request for sftp by user joe May  1 20:01:09 joes-imac.local sshd[50199]: subsystem request for sftp by user joe May  1 20:01:09 joes-imac.local sftp-server[50200]: session opened for local user joe from [::1] May  1 20:01:09 joes-imac.local sftp-server[50200]: received client version 3 May  1 20:01:09 joes-imac.local sftp-server[50200]: realpath "."

Look at its man page.  <comment151416> On what version of Apple's OS did you make this change? <comment151417> The version is v10.9.2
