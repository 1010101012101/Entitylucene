Running AppleScript When Inserting a Blank CD <body> I want to automatically burn a cross-platform data CD with the same contents each time a blank disc is inserted, and eject it when done. To that end I created a very simple AppleScript that does just that:   precodedo shell script "/bin/bash -c 'hdiutil burn ~/Desktop/catalog.iso'" /code/pre  It works fine from the AppleScript editor. If I click "Run" with a blank CD inside, it burns the CD with the data from the .iso and ejects it upon completion.  However, if I select "Run code~/Desktop/burn.scpt/code" as the default action when inserting a blank CD, nothing happens. I actually have to open the AppleScript editor and select "Run". How can I make it actually run the script?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uKgHJ.png" alt="blank cd dialog"  <answer37786> Open burn.scpt in the AppleScript Editor and save it as an Application. Then select burn.app as the desired action on CD popup.  <comment42882> That's a good idea, but it still doesn't work! If I insert the CD and then double-click the newly created Burn application it works, but it doesn't work if I auto-run it on insert. <comment42897> Hmm. What version of the OS are you running? I'll try to replicate the problem. <comment42923> Running Mac OS 10.7.2 <comment42950> 'Doh. Sorry, I can't replicate, because my machine running 10.7.2 doesn't have a CD drive. Maybe someone else can help here.
