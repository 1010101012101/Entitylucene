iPad/iPhone AnyConnect VPN wrong MTU size <body> I try to connect with a iPad (iOS 5.1) and the AnyConnect app to connect to a OpenVPN server on a Debian server. But this warning always appears in the OpenVPN log:     WARNING: Bad encapsulated packet length from peer (5635), which must   be  0 and &lt;= 1560 -- please ensure that --tun-mtu or --link-mtu is   equal on both peers   On the server side the tun interface mtu size is 1500 bytes. I can connect with other clients (pcs, macs, ...) to the server. But with a iPad or iPhone client this warning appears and no connection is established.  How can I fix this?  Br  <answer55885> Unfortunately, it isn't possible to set the MTU on iOS. There is no GUI for it, and without jailbreaking you can't access the codeifconfig/code command line tool that would be used to configure this on OS X (I think codeifconfig/code might not exist anyway even if you do jailbreak).  I have the same problem with a VPN I use occasionally. To use it with OS X I have to run codesudo ifconfig ppp0 mtu 1270/code. From iOS there is no solution, however I've noticed VLC clients seem to work fine even with a broken MTU and am able to access the office network that way.  To fix this, you're going to have to configure your server somehow - that would be a good question for Serve Fault.  <comment89638> Hmm, from what I can see AnyConnect doesn't support OpenVPN servers at all? <comment105080> I think it does exist, I've used it a few time on my iPad. But command line network utilities on iOS devices is quite crappy. <comment265014> @ShaneHsu do you have any example of such tool?
