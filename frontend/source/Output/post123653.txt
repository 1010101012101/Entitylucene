Can't install font in Mavericks: FOND offset usability <body> I am trying to copy a Franklin Gothic font from my old 10.5 machine onto my late 2012 iMac running Mavericks, but with I go to install the font through Font Book it gives a 'FOND' offset usability warning for every weight. If I check it despite the warning and try to install, nothing happens. How can I get around this?  <comment144468> reading this might help: http://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html#fontsyoucancannotuse <comment144481> Nope. That does not help. As mentioned the font is from a machine that was already running 10.5 which is OS X.
