How to disable Safari's new "feed://" redirection for feeds? <body> I'm sure some people really love that new feature, but I use Google Reader so it's driving me batty. Not to mention that as a tech guy, I might want to actually view an XML feed once in a while (like for instance, Sparkle update feeds).  So how do I stop Safari from redirecting the normal XML feeds to their "feed://" pseudo-protocol?  <answer20557> Apparently, it used to be possible in Tiger/Safari 2.0 to disable this using codedefaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSyndicationEnabled -bool NO/code. (source) I cannot get this to work in Lion/Safari 5.1, however.  Your best bet seems to be to set the default feed reader (Safari → Preferences… → RSS) to something that gives you XML source.  <answer157739> Just in case that would be useful, disable RSS feed in Safari 5 : Safari top menu -- Preferences -- RSS -- uncheck both boxes next to "automatically update articles in" Done.  <comment161151> There is no Safari-Preferences-RSS in Safari 7 <comment161153> That answer was written long before Safari 7's release.
