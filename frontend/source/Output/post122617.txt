CalenderAgent: howto allow connection only if needed? <body> I use Little Snitch, and there I can see that CalenderAgent still connects to Google and iCloud even if iCal is not running.br For several reasons I want to allow CalenderAgent to make connections only if iCal is running.br I already tried to block it using Little Snitch but it didn't work.   How could solve this... maybe with a shell script?
