Connecting to iPhone hotspot weird behaviour <body> When connecting to the hotspot from Mac OS Sierra, I click the network icon in the top bar and see the iPhone in the list of wifi networks. If I select the phone it always fails. After a couple of seconds the hotspot reappears in the list but with an indication of the type of connection the phone has (3G, 4G..). If I click on this one the connection works but I think it is over bluetooth. Is this behaviour normal?
