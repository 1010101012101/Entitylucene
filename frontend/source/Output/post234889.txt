How to prevent Anyconnect disconnect when locking screen <body> Mac Book pro with 10.11.2 have this annoying feature that it disconnects Cisco AnyConnect VPN every time I lock screen. I found some instructions how to prevent wifi disconnection when locking screen, but I could not apply same instructions for anyconnect network. IÂ´m usually connected with ethernet cable, if that matters.  Is there some way to disable such feature?  <answer290817> I have the same problem - my internet connection is 10/100 USB LAN.  If I have Cisco anyconnect connected to the vpn and lock the screen it drops the vpn.  The screensaver locking it seemed to not disconnect.    I am on 10.11.6 - El Capitan.  I use the lock screen solution described here:  MBP Lock screen hotkey without sleeping?  Did you find a solution?  This is widely reported when people have wifi connections and lock the screen but there seem to be many potential solutions with nothing definitive.  Your post seems to be somewhat unique in that it is a wired setup like mine.  Any thoughts appreciated.
