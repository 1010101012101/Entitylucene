Complete shortcut in Messages on OS X <body> Found a "Complete" shortcut in Messages on OS X under codeEdit/code, I want to know what it does exactly, but can't find any info. Anyone knows?  <answer128995> It’s a text autocomplete feature. You can type codewhen/code and press codeEsc/code to shows all the available words. It’s available everywhere, not just strongMessages/strong. But somehow strongMessages/strong doesn’t act according to its function, I believe it’s a bug, or Messages uses different frameworks for the text field.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/86zxA.gif" alt="Autocomplete Text"  <comment151021> how do you do the gif animation (with what?) <comment151022> @Buscar웃 I use [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/). <comment151095> Thanks for the answer. Any idea why this shortcut works with just `Esc` when it says `Option + Esc` in the menu?
