Problem with video recordings on iPhone 6 <body> For quite a while now my iPhone has had the following problem:  When I record a video with loud background sound (loud music, screaming, etc.), the video only shows without any sound.  Now the funny thing is, when I record a video on snapchat, it doesnÂ´t matter how loud it is where I am; the sound is clearly audible there.  Does anybody here have experience with this problem or has an idea on how to solve it?  <comment370772> I have the same and it's driving me crazy. Normal , everyday videos are ok, but if I have been to a concert where it's really loud, i just hear silent/ static. Happens on both front and back camera. Don't seem to get any answers anywhere. I know that I am not covering any mic too as have been really careful.
