Using a Ukelele-created keyboard doesn't work in Chrome <body> I tired to do the following:  ol liSelect the original US Keyboard layout as my current keyboard./li liLaunched Ukelele/li liChose New  From current input source/li liSwapped a single key/li liSaved the file in my keyboard layouts and chose it as my input method./li /ol  Now when I try to type in Chrome, it doesn't output anything. It works fine in other apps such as TextEdit, though.  <answer46672> Try rebooting.   This helped me to globally apply a new keyboard layout - often logging out and back in helps, sometimes you need a reboot.  <comment53142> Have you tried rebooting ? <comment55018> Merely restarting *Chrome* did the trick for me.
