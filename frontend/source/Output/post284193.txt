Is there a way to add a note to the iOS Health app? <body> strongIs it possible to add a comment or note to the Health app?/strong I could see this ability as a useful way to interpret or supplement the data.   For example, if I'm sick for a few days, it could explain a change in my diet or weight. ("Today was Day 3 of flu symptoms, but I'm feeling better than yesterday.") Or, if I'm on a medication, I might want to make notes of any observations. ("I forgot to take my X pill last night; today, I have a headache.")  <answer284536> h2Adding notes in Health.app/h2  No, as of iOS 10.3.x you can't add comments to Health.app and its database.  hr  h2Alternative (3rd party apps)/h2  If you want to enter any notes or observations you need to rely on a third party app to do so.  Ideally, this app should be able to export your notes in a non-proprietary format like XML. Not all apps (e.g. Pillow) with a notes feature allow you to do that. (Thanks @Mark)  hr  h2Alternative (use unused fields)/h2  You may use unused Health.app fields to store your observations. Below are strongspecial data types/strong that exceed the usual 'one value + one time stamp' values.  With graphs  ul liUV Index (strongone number, start time, end time/strong)/li liSleep Analysis (three values, start time, end time)/li liBlood Pressure (two numbers)/li /ul  Without graphs  ul liCarvical Mucus Quality (five values)/li liMenstruation (four values + one boolean (yes/no))/li liOvulation Test Result (three values)/li liSexual Activity (three values)/li /ul  You could totally add 'UV Index' (value + duration) for headaches and 'Vitamin B12' for forgotten medications. Add them to Health.app's Today view using the 'Add to favorites' toggle and you're done.  <comment358819> And the third party apps don't always export that - e.g. Pillow <comment358847> Thank you @Mark, I've added this to the answer. <comment358868> Thanks, @oa- . That's not the answer I wanted, but so be it. This issue has led me to ask a related question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/284576/72448 <comment358928> Be careful taking X pills - overuse of MDMA destroys the brains ability to replenish serotonin.
