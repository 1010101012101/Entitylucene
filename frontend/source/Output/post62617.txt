Ethernet cable connected iMac fails to connect to Internet after sleep mode <body> Similar issue to this has been reported for WiFi situations but my iMac (previous Snow Leopard up to date software recently updated to Mountain Lion) fails to allow we access to the Internet after going to "sleep" mode.  I have to run the network diagnostics but it fails to fix anything just asks me to "reset the device" Which is a Westell Modem working perfectly for all other machines except mine with Mountain Lion (never had this problem before with Snow Leopard).  Now I do not even run the diagnostics, I just turn the modem on and off but this is far from an ideal solution. Anybody has any clues as what to do in this case?  <comment72309> I've had this happen to me twice, but haven't found a pattern to reproduce it, so I wasn't able to diagnose it.  I have a bunch of other devices dependent on the modem and router (including a VoIP ATA) so I just restarted the iMac. <comment72365> Have you tried renewing your DHCP lease? Next time this occurs, go to System Preferences  Network  (choose your network type)  Advanced...  TCP/IP  press Renew DHCP Lease.
