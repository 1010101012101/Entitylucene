Terminal Command to display a single line from a text file in OS X <body> I want to display at a specific line, e.g. line 4, from a text file in Terminal (I need this for character counts, using codewc/code). I'm sure this is a simple problem but coderead -e 1 filename/code doesn't do it.  What can be used to accomplish this task?  <answer200414> You can use codesed/code command:  precodesed -n '4p' YOUR_FILE /code/pre  Or codehead/code/codetail/code combination:  precodehead -n 4 YOUR_FILE | tail -n 1 /code/pre  <comment241492> Thanks. I expect that some form of cat or pr would also do it. I used:head -n 2 filename | tail -n 1 | wc -m That gives the number of characters + 1 (an end of line char?) br/ <comment241493> Thanks. head/tail is much quicker (large file)
