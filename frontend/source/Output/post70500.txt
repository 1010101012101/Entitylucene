MacBook IR adaptor <body> I have a MacBook AIR without IR and an Apple remote control (bought without knowing my laptop didn't have IR). I am looking for an IR adaptor. Can you please recommend me one that works on Mac?  <answer70502> Have a look at Mira and Remote Buddy, which are programs to enable the Apple Remote on systems that don't have it built-in (they also provide expanded functionality I believe). They both have hardware compatibility lists that should provide you with some good suggestions (here for Mira, and here for Remote Buddy.  <comment81825> Thank you. I also found these:http://www.amazon.co.uk/Max-Value-Infrared-Adapter-MV42440/dp/B001GXR77E/ref=cm_srch_res_rtr_1 or http://www.amazon.com/Adapter-USB-2-0-IrDA-Compatible/dp/B006VJ049Q or http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JPGQ4U/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_2?pf_rd_p=486540031&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B006VJ049Q&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=10TK3KDCSWE3QJTTSJQD. The comments are pro and against. Do you think one of there might help me use the remote? Thank you! <comment81829> I checked the site indicated: http://twistedmelon.com/mira/ It is yet unclear for me (I am not specialist at all): should I also order an external IR receiver or is it enough to buy the software? (I have the Apple remote). Thanks <comment81830> You definitely need a receiver if you have a Mac without a built-in receiver. Otherwise the software has no way to read the IR signals. <comment81836> Thank you! I will try to read more about the IR sticks.
