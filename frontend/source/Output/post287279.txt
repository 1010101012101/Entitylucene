NFS unmount in Finder is leaving multiple mount folders behind <body> I am mounting my Music library via nfs on my mac by using the 'Connect to Server' page and opening codenfs://fileserver/audio/code. This works fine, but after having occasional issues with iTunes I found that when I unmount/disconnect the drive - Finder does not remove the mount folder.  I've also put a Screenshot for reference.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AiPDg.png" alt="Volumes Folder"  <comment362653> already figured it out myself (classic) If you ask the question you find the answer shortly after. iTunes is recreating the Folder when it starts, regardless of a connected nfs drive. So if the folder exists it recreats it, causing nfs to append the numbers.
