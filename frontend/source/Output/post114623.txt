why Keynote ignores AppleAntiAliasingThreshold for text underline? <body> I'm using Keynote '09 (version 5.3 (1170) from App Store on OS X 10.8) as per Can I design web graphics with Pages more easily?, and I have codedefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleAntiAliasingThreshold 24/code, so, fonts smaller than 24 don't get anti-aliased, which works great in Keynote, except for the text underline feature.  (How do I know what's going on?  It's apparent when you export to PNG, and then zoom within the PNG.)  strongWhy is Keynote rendering the line under the font with anti-aliasing, when the font itself is rendered without anti-aliasing?/strong
