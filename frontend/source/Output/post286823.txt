El Capitan 10.11.6 shows external hard drive mounted but I can't access <body> I have been happily using my Drobo external HD with MacBook Pro with no issues until yesterday. They are connected with Firewire. When I turn on the Drobo, the drive shows up in the Disk Utility as mounted, but the Volume is unmounted. Nothing happens when I click on the "mount" button. The Drobo does not show up on the desktop or Finder as it used to. Drobo Dashboard has no problem seeing it.  Oddly, I did not update El Capitan until last night, AFTER this problem started. I wanted to make sure updates are current both with the OS and Drobo firmware. But after re-booting, still no luck.  Of course, I use the Drobo for Time Machine which does not see it.  Thanks for any suggestions, solutions, help!    <comment362030> It's highly unlikely that the issue is with your Mac.  More than likely the issue is with Drobo.  I threw out Drobos from our org because they would just fail losing all our data.  It was a known issue.  For our org I went with Exadata and for smaller installs Synology. <comment362051> Allan, I fear I may have to agree with you as I just connected the Drobo to my "spare" MacBook Pro and have the same issue. <comment362057> I empathize with you - been there.  The issue with Drobo using their "Beyond RAID" tech was that it was supposed to safeguard your data.  In our many cases, it didn't.  By comparison, my personal Synology has been going 5 years with only 1 drive failure and I haven't lost a single byte of data.  Got my fingers crossed for you. <comment362211> Further research revealed the issue is with Time Machine and Drobo. Apparently TM somehow changes all the files, the whole drive, to Read Only access. Now trying to figure out a work around for THAT!  At least I didn't lose the files.
