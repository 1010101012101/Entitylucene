Keyboard/Mouse Not Responsive During Bootcamp Windows 8 Install <body> I'm trying to install a copy of Windows 8 via Bootcamp on my late-2013 13" Retina Macbook Pro. Everything goes fine up until it asks me to pick a home screen color and name my computer. The built-in keyboard and mouse stop working and none of the USB keyboards/mice that I plug in work either.  Has anyone else run into this problem or have an idea of how to solve it?
