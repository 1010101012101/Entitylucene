Sharing non iTunes music on family sharing <body> my question is can you share music from you iTunes library if you put it on there from a CD. We have a lot of CD's at home and on my parents computer and any help would be greatly appreciated.  <answer198801> Only locally with Home Sharing.  Apple states that with Family Sharing activated, you can share     Music, movies, and TV shows from the iTunes Store.   but you can't share     Songs added to iTunes Match from outside the iTunes Store.   hr  For Home Sharing:  You have to rip all your cd's first. Then open iTunes and turn on Home Sharing.  From Apple's Support:     ol   liOpen iTunes and make sure you have the latest version./li   liGo to File  Home Sharing  Turn on Home Sharing./li   liEnter your Apple ID and password. Make sure to use the same Apple ID when you set up Home Sharing on your other devices./li   liRepeat these steps on other computers that you want to use with Home Sharing/li   /ol   This will only work with iTunes, Apple TV's and iDevices on the same network, and the sharing computer must be turned on.
