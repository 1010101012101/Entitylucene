My iPhone 5S won't play music <body> Some of the songs automatically skip, while others show that they're playing, but there is no sound, both with and without headphones. I can play songs through Spotify and listen to podcasts. Sometimes I can get Siri to play a song, but not always.  <comment335890> Are these songs that are downloaded to your phone, or playing through Apple Music?
