Safari 'forgets' cookies, iTunes requires authentication 3 times? <body> I'm having some really odd problems with my new Mac, that I haven't encountered ever before. Every time I restart my iMac, Safari 'forgets' all cookies and stored website data, which means I have to log in to every site again (usernames/passwords are still auto-filled, it's just the cookies, local storage and history which are gone). I'll do that on a regular basis, but daily is a bit too much for me, especially with 2FA activated on most sites.  The second problem which might or might not be related (started about the same time) is that I have to enter my iTunes credentials 3 times in a row before the dialog stops bugging me and I can use iTunes. I don't exactly know what it's doing after the login, it doesn't complain if I hit 'cancel' either.  Talking about a new iMac, OS X 10.10.1  Any ideas?  <answer159575> My bet would be your keychain is corrupt.   Launch Keychain Access in Applications/Utilities.  From the main Keychain Access menu choose Keychain First Aid.  Enter your password &amp; then Verify.  If it finds any errors, then run Repair.  I've found that after that, it can still find errors to fix, so keep running verify/repair until it runs clean.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bObNK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment187958> That was a good guess. Even though there were no errors in the verification, repair helped. I also did a repair on disk permissions just in case.
