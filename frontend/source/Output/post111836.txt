How can I create a modifier shortcut to drag files into a new folder? <body> When dragging a file or files in the Finder, it is possible to hold certain modifier keys to change exactly what you're doing (e.g. kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbd to create an alias).  I'd like to be able to drag several files, hold down some combination of modifiers, drop them in a folder, and find them in a newly-created subfolder there.  I don't believe there is a native way to do this, but how can I create a macro to accomplish this with Better Touch Tool or Keyboard Maestro?  <answer111916> As of OS X 10.9 “Mavericks”, you can do this right from the Finder:  ol liSelect your files./li liDrag ’n’ drop the files to their new destination./li liPress kbd⌃/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdN/kbd to create a “New Folder with Selection”./li liOptionally, type a new name the folder and press kbdreturn/kbd (otherwise, the file will be named “New Folder With Items”)./li /ol  You bring up 3rd-party apps. I don’t see how Keyboard Maestro could help in this particular instance.  Hazel — or indeed Apple’s own folder actions — might, but only if your target was always the same folder or set of folders.  But you might want to look at some of LaunchBar’s less known capabilities: here’s a deep navigationless link to their keyboard-powered drag-and-drop instructions.
