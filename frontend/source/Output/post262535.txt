Want to import photos as referenced images automatically into Photos <body> Trying to import pictures into Photos automatically as referenced images (the option "Copy items in Photos library" is unchecked in the Preferences) via Folder Actions or AppleScript does not seem to work. It looks like "Import Files into Photos" action defaults to copy the imported files into the library... Any workaround? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6P50.png" alt="That&#39;s my current simple Folder Action" My workflow is Lightroom - JPEG export to Dropbox for easy sharing and ideally I would like these downselected JPEGs to be imported into Photos to use them with Shared Streams and Memories.  <comment328910> Some examples I've looked into: https://gist.github.com/natcl/7a5c98aae8b21475caf9
