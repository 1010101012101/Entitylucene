Create backup iPhone with forgotten encryption password <body> I'm trying to make a backup from my iPhone, however it's set to be password protected. I do not know the password, as I've never set one. I've tried all the passwords I know, which I've ever used to make sure I didn't set it.  I've also tried the default code0000/code and code1234/code codes.   I want to uncheck the encryption checkbox in iTunes, but it requires me to type a password. What else can I try?  I have no problems in removing all backups and start from the scratch somehow, however - I do not want to restore my phone as new and remove all those settings.       <answer86295> The short answer is no. The phone thinks you are a thief trying to steal the data and won't cooperate with attempts to initiate a second backup. Your best bet is if you have a computer that was syncing / backing up the device and follow the steps listed for a disabled device with a passcode:  ul liiOS: Device disabled after entering wrong passcode/li /ul  Once your iOS device is locked with a passcode, the data at rest is scrambled and the decryption key is only stored inside the iOS keychain or inside a backup of the device in iCloud or on a computer.  Even if you connected the device to a computer and got past the hardware telling the USB storage to not present itself - you would need to perform a decryption of whatever forensic image you retrieved.  Without knowing your situation (exact device, iOS version, whether it's an older device that doesn't have Data Protection, where else you may have backed up the device so that you could try restoring a backup onto an unlocked device (where you could then choose a different passcode) it's hard to guess what your best move is next.  You could:  ul liedit more details into the question/li liask a follow on question once you've explored your options/li liContact Apple to do some troubleshooting / learn more options/li /ul  <answer86483> if you have no problem deleting your backup this "problem" is a breeze! head over to iTunes, then open up the preferences, klick on devises, then select your phone, and delete the backup!  if you want an additional safety net, you can copy your backupfile, just in case its located in  ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ for mac os   C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup for xp  C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup for xp-7 (prob 8)  when backup deleted simply create a new backup from scratch :)
