Applescript or Automator service that automatically trusts certificates <body> I would like to know, if there is a way to make an Automator service or an Applescript that automatically trusts a root certificate. If possible without a prompt for password or Admin privileges. Could it be possible to do that maybe with codetell application "Keychain Access"/code   or   precodedo shell script "sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain &lt;certificate&gt;" /code/pre  If possible without the sudo.  <answer187097> h1Undesirable Behaviour/h1  There is no intended way to add trusted root certificates without requiring authorisation from the user or an administrator.  Any method that manages to add a trusted root certificate without confirming, at some stage, the credentials of the user would be considered a serious security bug.  h2What is the Risk?/h2  Once a root certificate is trusted, it provides an automatic degree of trust for other certificates, applications, and content.  If a script, process, or tool could add trusted root certificates without authorisation, then it opens the possibly to perform malicious actions on a Mac â€“ without the user knowing.  <comment221095> Thanks. I would expose myself alot if I would try something like that.
