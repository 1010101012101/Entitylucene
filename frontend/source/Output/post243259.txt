Cannot restart Mac, Finder issues in El Capitan <body> I've been having some issues with an iMac running El Capitan. The issue seems to be Finder. I tried leaving it to shut down by itself overnight to no avail.   On occasion I get this message: The screenshot below is Dutch but says something along the lines of:      Your Mac was not shut down because Finder could not be stopped. Please quit ?Finder to continue.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yrUw1.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3Things I've tried/h3  ul liI've tried shutting it down with a hard reset (power button and a shutdown command from terminal) and restarting. /li liI've tried disk repair in recovery mode, /li liI've tried resetting NVRAM./li liI've tried shutting down Finder with the usual suspects: Force Quit, codekillall Finder/code. /li /ul  This last one does something, but definitely not what I expect:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/go38k.png" alt="enter image description here"   It emlooks/em like Finder has quit, it's no longer in the list activity monitor. Relaunching it with terminal command codeopen ./code in the user home folder gives the error:      codeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -600.../code   Don't know how to fix it anymore. Any advice?  <answer250081> I wasn't able to use finder to shut down or restart my macbook air after upgrading to El Capitan until I did a hard shut down and restarted in safe mode (hold down the shift key when restarting).  Logged in as usual, then used finder to restart.  Everything is working as it should now.    <answer276448> My issue turned out to be in an outdated Wacom driver. After removing it, Mac worked fine. I guess formatting would have sorted it out too.   <comment299534> Is this the exclusive time this has happened, or is this beyond an isolated incident? <comment299543> Hi @JMY1000, it's not isolated in the sense that it doesn't go away no matter what I try. Otherwise I wouldn't need to ask you guys ;) It is isolated in the sense that it's the only Mac I know with this issue. <comment299547> Is it the only time it's happened with this Mac? <comment299548> It's the first time it's happened to this Mac, yes. It's fairly new, perhaps 6 months. <comment299550> Just a quick question, did you tried to use cmd+alt+escape and kill finder ? This occasionally happens with the mail app but not finder..  I'm afraid a re-install will fix this issue. <comment299551> @rwzdoorn Yeah, I tried killing finder any way I could think of <comment299552> Did you tried to re-install OSX ? You don't need a clean install. <comment299555> @rwzdoorn I have not, I was hoping for a different solution before resorting to the big guns. How do I reinstall without erasing? <comment299556> Have a look here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114814/how-to-reinstall-repair-os-x-without-losing-files  Always make a backup first ! <comment299747> What if you just unplug the power?
