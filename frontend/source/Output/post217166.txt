unknown option: mode-mouse with iterm, tmux <body> Reset my computer and iterm2,tmux now complaining about my code.tmux.conf/code having  precodesetw -g mode-mouse on set -g mouse-select-pane on set -g mouse-resize-pane on set -g mouse-select-window off set -g  default-terminal "screen-256color" /code/pre  i.e.  /Users/mdurrant/.tmux.conf:24: unknown option: mode-mouse                  [0/0] /Users/mdurrant/.tmux.conf:25: unknown option: mouse-select-pane /Users/mdurrant/.tmux.conf:26: unknown option: mouse-resize-pane /Users/mdurrant/.tmux.conf:27: unknown option: mouse-select-window  so I have to comment them out,... but then my mouse doesn't work in tmux which is a pain.  How to enable mouse in iterms2 w/tmux ?  This works on my other osx macbook air ok.  tmux is version 2.1  <answer217167> This looks like a change in tmux in 2.0 - 2.1  I've replaced  precodesetw -g mode-mouse on set -g mouse-select-pane on set -g mouse-resize-pane on set -g mouse-select-window off /code/pre  with just  precodeset-option -g mouse on /code/pre  and everything seems ok  <comment307909> `mouse on` configures the following: `The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to copy text and to change window using the status line.`, so it's the equivalent of setting `mouse-select-pane`, `mouse-resize-pane` and `mouse-select-window` as `on`.  Probably close enough to the original configuration; though not exactly the same.
