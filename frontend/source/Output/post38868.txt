How can I sync my iPad apps onto a new iPhone? <body> I've just got a new iPhone and I want to sync my iPad apps between the iPhone and the iPad.  However when I try to enable synchronization for apps for my iPad, it says that if I try to synchronize, all of my apps will be deleted.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7uP5.png" alt="app sync"  Am I doing something wrong? I understand that I should first synchronize my iPad apps into iTunes and then enable app synchronization for the iPhone ... but I don't want to lose the apps that are installed on the iPad in the process.  <answer46026> No, you're not. The iOS device is a consumption device - every time you toggle the app sync option it will try to "reset"/wipe the existing apps and re-transfer them. Either leave that option on or tweak it and set your sync to Manual.   To sync your apps to a new device, you have to transfer as to it as a new device. Existing folder structures you had on the iPad do not transfer to phones. You cannot restore configs between different devices.  New phone = new setup of apps and their folders. You sync between your iTunes library and device not device to device.  <comment52544> Does this behaviour differ if the user performs an iCloud restore on the new device? I was under the impression that process did indeed sync from device to device...
