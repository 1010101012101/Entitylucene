-bash: Support: command not found on terminal startup <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUGFg.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm getting this message when my terminal starts up. I have checked my code.bash_profile/code and code.profile/code files. I could not find anything related with em'Support'/em. Any help would be appreciated.  <comment342749> How to you expect us to troubleshoot if you don't provide the contents of those files? What changes have you made to Terminal preferences and or its files like /etc/profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile?
