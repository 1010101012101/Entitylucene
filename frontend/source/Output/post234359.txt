Boot Camp makes unbootable USB drive <body> I used Boot Camp Assistant to create a Windows 10 install disk. However, the disk is not bootable. I am confused as to why Boot Camp Assistant would make an install disk not bootable. Can someone please help me? I am looking for someone to either a) explain how to recreate the install drive in a way that will make it bootable or b) explain how to force the drive to become bootable.  Here is the information:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbuHf.jpg" alt="Disk Utility Image"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XSxIO.jpg" alt="Disk Utility Information"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qjuhq.jpg" alt="Terminal information"  <answer234363> Your Mac Pro (MacPro4,1) officially neither supports Windows 10  nor booting from USB thumb drives.  The only Mac Pro model supporting Windows 10 installed with Boot Camp Assistant according to Apple is the Mac Pro (Late 2013).  <comment286532> Please add your Mac model (including year) and your current system version! <comment286534> Please note I used a MacBook Pro (mid-2014) to make this disk for a Mac Pro (2009) with 5,1 firmware. Could this switching of computers have been a problem? <comment286535> Even if I when I created the drive I added my model ID to Boot Camp Assistant's Info.plist? <comment286536> @NoahL I assume some drivers are missing. <comment286540> If your 2009 Mac Pro has a Optical Super Drive, why did you not try using a DVD to install Windows 10? No 2009 model Mac is capable of booting and installing windows from a USB drive. Apple did not add the USB install option until the 2012.
