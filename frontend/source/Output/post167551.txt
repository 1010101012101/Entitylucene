FaceTime calls wrong person <body> Often (not always) I try to call my mother using FaceTime it calls totally the wrong person. The wrong person it calls, is always the same wrong person. How is this even possible?  <answer167579> Open your Contacts and check all of the phone numbers and email addresses listed for the person that gets called (check your mother's contact as well).  This person's contact likely incorrectly contains your mother's phone number or email address.  Remove or correct the incorrect information from that person's contact information and the problem will go away.  <comment196451> Is it possible that there is a typo in the email address or phone number that you use to call your mom? Perhaps you could type the address in directly?
