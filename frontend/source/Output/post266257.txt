External SSD freezing because of "put hard disks to sleep when possible" <body> I got a new external SSD (well, I bought an SSD USB 3.0 enclosure and a 1 TB Crucial SSD and went from there) and it works great, but it started freezing up after I didn't interact with it for a while. It would freeze Finder completely (relaunching did no good) until I manually unplugged the hard drive. It appears the culprit was "Put hard disks to sleep when possible" in Energy Saver in System Preferences. If I open Disk Utility and get information on the drive, it says "Solid State: No." Is there any way to fix this so that option can remain checked and have my Mac not try to put my external SSD (which it thinks is an HDD, not an SSD) to sleep (which is impossible to do because it's an SSD and just causes it to freeze entirely)?  By the way, running macOS Sierra.
