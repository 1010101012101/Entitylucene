Assign shortcut for label in Finder <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Shortcuts to label files in Finder       Is there a way to assign some shortcuts for setting the label colour of the selected item in Finder, like it is in Aperture for example?  In Finder menu there is no particular name of the item related to the label which could be used in Keyboard Shortcuts section of Preferences.  <comment79816> [Another related question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/40203) <comment79817> Yes, really. That's a duplicate. Thank you.
