Weird Icon Trouble <body> I'm having trouble changing the icon on a MicroSD card. I change folder icons relatively often, and I'm stumped. I started off by changing the icon (a .png file) to some weird eye-looking thing, and it was impossible to see. So I wanted to change it to a gray folder. Seems simple enough. I opened the .png in Preview, selected all, copied, went to the microSD card, "get info," and then paste into the upper left where the icon goes. But it didn't show the new gray folder. It shows the weird eye that was hard to see.  I deleted the icon and reverted to the stock icon. That worked just fine. Over a period of 15 minutes, I copied and pasted a number of .png files to other places (just to make sure it was really copied), returned to the "get info" on the microSD card, and again, all it will show is the weird eye.   I deleted the icon again. I ejected the microSD card. Restarted my computer. My options remain the same - either the default SD card icon or the weird eye.   After some research, I found this article on using Terminal to delete the icon. I followed the instructions exactly. The icon appeared to be gone. When I copied and pasted the gray folder, again, all I got was the weird eye.  What is going on here? I don't have that weird eye saved anywhere on my computer anymore. I've tried numerous combinations of ejecting the microSD card, reverting to the default icon, and restarting my computer to no avail.   Would reformatting the microSD card fix this? Any other suggestions?  I'm on a MacBook Pro 13" Retina with macOS Sierra.
