The font Calibri is missing. Your text might look different with Pages, Numbers <body> My documents strongdo not/strong contain that font anywhere. But the iPad still complains about this. How can I remove completely these font from document? Is there a way to do this? Maybe there are special invisible chars with that font?  <comment261974> I'd just ignore it. You could Select All, and change the font. <comment303597> no, select all and changing font didnt help.
