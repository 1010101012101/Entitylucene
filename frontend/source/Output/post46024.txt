How do I stop email reminder from iCal? <body> I'm using Google calendar, and I subscribe to my Google Calendar from multiple computers.  Whenever I set an event with (an) email reminder(s) on Google calendar, I'll get multiple emails because (1) Google calendar itself sends me the email reminder and (2) each computer that subscribes the calendar tries to send the email reminder (when the computer wakes up).  It's very annoying.  <answer46027> You can disable all alerts, including email alerts, in ical via  precodeiCal --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Advanced --&gt; Turn off all alarms /code/pre  If you need to have iCal display alarms on the mac, but simply not send the email, then you will need to turn to other software.  Here are two applications that help tame iCal notifications:  http://www.nhoj.co.uk/icalreplychecker/   ul liThis should allow you to define what emails get sent.  It's primary use is taming meeting schedule notifications that iCal sends when you schedule a meeting with multiple participants, but it looks like it can be used to better configure what emails iCal sends/li /ul  http://cleancutcode.com/calendarbar/  ul liThis tracks your calendars (iCal, or google directly) and use growl to alert you for upcoming events.  Use this if you want to disable emails by disabling all iCal alerts, and then setting this up to receive the alerts on the mac that you want to receive onscreen./li /ul  <answer61633> For Mac OS X Mountain Lion  10.8.0:  ol liClick on the "Calendars" button on the main window to show the sidebar of calendars./li liRight mouse click on the calendar you want to ignore alerts from &amp; choose "Get Info"/li liCheck ON "Ignore Alerts" &amp; click "OK"/li /ol  Seems as thought you don't have to globally set this preference, you can now selectively choose which calendars have alerts or not, through iCal.  <answer74035> as far as i understand iCal it is on the "receivers/subscribers" side to deal with email-updates (and not on the "senders/changers" side) ...  to NOT get email notification about updated events from a shared calendar you subscribed to you have to stronguncheck "events affect availability"/strong in that calendars "info" (mac os X.7 and X.8: iCal — calendars dropdown — right click on the subscribed calendar — choose "get info" from the context-menu — uncheck "events affect availability")  this availability-logic kind of makes sense once you think about it ... problem is: "events affect availability" is checked by default for any newly subscribed shared calendar  here is a screenshot of the calendar-info-window: https://discussions.apple.com/message/20506464#20506464  <answer233427> I created a filter in gmail to delete these alert emails.  It's not a perfect solution, but I do want to be able to receive alerts in iCal, and I want to receive email alerts from Google Calendar as well. This meets both of those requirements, but it's definitely a workaround.  <comment52499> What version of the operating system are you running? <comment52504> +1 for CalendarBar, I use it all the time and its awesome! <comment98225> "iCal -- Preferences -- Advanced -- Turn off all alarms" is not available on Mac OS X 10.8 as far as I can tell. <comment117334> Dammit... Clean Cut Code has closed down and discontinued CalendarBar <comment164025> @pauldoo: ...and the option did not come back in OS X 10.9 "Mavericks" either. Which is a real pity. <comment230968> This turns off everything, right?  Not just email notification, but also the notification center pop-ups. <comment337184> Also not in MacOs 12.12 "Sierra" either.
