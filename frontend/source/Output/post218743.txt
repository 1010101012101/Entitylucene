Look Up - AppleScript command <body> Is there an apple script command for the em"Look Up"/em action/service? If not, what would be a decent way to mimic it?  If you don't know what I'm talking about it's the popover when you three-finger click some thing, or select some text and select emLook Up "some text"/em in the contextual menu. img src="https://i.imgur.com/aaPnPSD.png" alt="Look Up"  <comment264464> Cmd/Ctrl/D mimics it pretty well already ;) <comment264887> @Tetsujin I suppose, that works, but not a big fan of mimicking keystrokes. Thanks for pointing that out anyways.
