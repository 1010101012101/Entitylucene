AppleScript Text Delimiter for most recent text <body> I have a lot of text on the file codeMy_Note_Backup.txt/code  Each time I run an another script, it added to this text something like   precodedemo demo { demo demo demo demo } demo ... /code/pre  and this repeats around 60 times a day.  How can I have an AppleScript which copies only the last note in between { and }  I have the text delimiter here, but how can I get the most recent text only?  precodeset theName to "" set theName to the clipboard  set theText to Unicode text set theSource to theName property leftEdge1 : "{" property rightEdge2 : "}" try     set saveTID to text item delimiters     set text item delimiters to leftEdge1     set classValue to text item 2 of theSource     set text item delimiters to rightEdge2     set theName to text item 1 of classValue     set text item delimiters to saveTID     theName end try set the clipboard to theName /code/pre  the text file is   precodeset dataBackupFile to (path to desktop folder as text) &amp; "My_Note_Backup.txt" /code/pre  <answer267672> There are a number of options to enable you to run a regex search in Applescript, which is probably the easiest way to do what you're looking for. The below code is written using Satimage, but you can also use any of the other options with the same regex string.  precodeset regexStr to "(?&lt;={\n)[^{}]*(?=\n}[^}]*\Z)" find text regexStr in dataBackupFile with regexp and string result /code/pre  Given the text you provided, this would return:  precodedemo demo demo demo demo /code/pre  For completeness sake, I'll just break down the regex:  precode(?&lt;={\n)[^{}]*(?=\n}[^}]*\Z) (?&lt;={\n)                     - makes sure the match is immediately preceded by {\n         [^{}]*               - matches as many non-brackets as it can (your string)               (?=\n}[^}]*\Z) - makes sure the match is immediately followed by a                                close bracket, with no more brackets between it and                                the end of the file /code/pre  strongEdit:/strong I just noticed that your example text has been edited by someone else since you first posted. If you actually meant that it's all on one line separated by spaces, you should replace the code\n/codes with spaces.  <comment336019> That's look good unfortunately some of my colleagues have managed profile and won't be able to install any extension <comment336020> @KevinCork What?
