How do I obtain my dead husband's password for his iPhone? <body> My husband died.  I have the death certificate.  Also using his iPhone.  Don't have his password.  Would like to obtain it.  How do I do that?  <answer155547> Ultimately, with a court order, or notarised will, etc, presented to Apple.br There have been many tales online of that being the only way.  I found an SE reference, linking a BBC report - Bypassing dead relatives Apple ID?  <comment183004> Maybe just contact Apple?
