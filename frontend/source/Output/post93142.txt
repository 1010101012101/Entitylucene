Messages and AIM confusion <body> My aim screen name is my email address. Lets call it foo@bar.com. It's the same email address that I have on my apple account for I messages. Occasionally - 3-4 times a week - a colegue will message me on what he assumes is aim and it goes to my iPhone messages. I'll then reply to him via aim on my laptop and the message goes to the same conversation thread on his laptop. To him it shows as a single conversation.   I'm sure this has to do with I messages getting confused with the email addresses being the same.   Anyone seen this issue or have any ideas? Other than change my aim screen name?  <comment109285> Is it your primary iMessage email? <comment109316> phone and email are listed under "Can be reached at" start new conversations is from phone number (from iPhone settings).
