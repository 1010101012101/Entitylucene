Cannot delete songs from iPhone <body> On my iPhone I see a list of songs I cannot delete. Here's what I tried:  ul liGo to settings - memory usage - iTunes - delete all music/li liDisable iTunes Match/li liDisable show all music/li liConnect to iTunes on the Mac and manually remove all synced songs/li liSwipe to delete does not work/li liThe songs do not show any sort if cloud icons/li /ul  iTunes shows 3.3GB of Audio on my device which I cannot get rid of.  Any other ideas what to try?  <answer177779> I finally fixed it by restoring from an iCloud backup. But I read that this does not seem to work for some users.   I personally think, iTunes' quality is really bad and I'm tempted to move over to Amazon's music service but I love the Apple ecosystem and they probably have other issues. Sigh.  <comment210233> I’ve had this problem for a years and i’ve tried nearly everything to resolve it. I’ve restored countless times used all the Explorer apps to manually delete files.  I have zombie songs on my iPhone with cloud music turned off. Interestingly/infuriatingly iTunes on my Mac mini shows a different set of songs and my Macbook Pro shows yet ANOTHER completely different set of songs!  If I delete them in iTunes with manually manage music on iTunes lies about updating my iPhone but the songs remain. I should mention that they are the  greyed out like they are syncing but they never do.
