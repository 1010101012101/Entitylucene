How do I send a calendar event from the iphone calendar via an email or imessage? <body> I want to forward a specific calendar event from the iOS Calendar App to an email address or iMessage address or text message using my iPhone. I don't want to use the cloud or sync anything. I am using iOS 8.4 but would also be interested in how to do this in iOS 9.  <answer214434> The simplest method would be to use a contact in your address-book and add them as an invitee to the calendar event.  You will be prompted to send an invite to them.  EDIT: Previous link sucked.  Here are the steps:  ol liLaunch the Calendar app on your iPhone or iPad./li liEither create a new event or tap an existing event that you'd like to share./li liTap on the Edit button in the upper right hand corner./li liTap on Invitees. Add all the email addresses of the people you'd like to share the event with./li /ol  <comment258932> Your link seems to be about iCloud on OSX, not the iPhone. <comment258973> There is no Invitees option when I edit an event
