Is it possible to disable MacBook trackpad under Windows 7? <body> Is it possible to disable trackpad when running Windows 7 on Macbook Air/Pro? Anyone with this setup can confirm that it's possible?  (I don't use this setup yet, I'm just thinking about it, and want to make sure it supports my needs).  <answer24602> You can disable it in System - Hardware as far as I remember.  <answer28900> Via Control Panel you can't. Although you can disable the "touch click", and that way the click is made by "clicking" the trackpad, thus reducing accidental clicking. There are 3rd-party tools for disabling it easily, or when a mouse is connected, but the few I tried (Trackpad++ and TrackpadMagic) didn't work for me (MBA Mid2011 + Win7)  <answer97553> You can disable it in bootcamp control panel.  <answer146078> Start  Control Panel  Devices and Printers  Apple Keyboard/Trackpad  Right click, Properties  Hardware  HID- Compliant mouse, MICE and OT..  Properties  Anable/Disable//  You must disable the both Mice and ot.. becouse one is for the click's and one is for the mouse movement.

I figured out how to stop that annoying errant cursor from suddenly moving my typing to an unintended place.  Ignore all you have read above.  On the Start bar at the bottom on your screen, far right find the Boot Camp icon. Click it See "Boot Camp Control Panel..." Click it Click Yes to allowing to proceed See at the top tabs "Trackpad" Click it unclick Tap To Click click OK  Voila!  Now touching the track pad won't move the cursor...only pressing down to "click" it will.  <answer244742> Go to Device Manager, expand Human Interface Devices, find the Apple Multi-touch device, right click it, choose disable.  Done!  <comment27621> I was looking for simple checkbox rather than disabling device in hardware list, but that will also work I guess. Thanks. <comment27860> Well there's also the Touchpad settings in Control Panel - Mouse but I'm not sure if you can perma-disable it there. Might be worth a look. <comment27873> that's why I asked here ;-) I don't use this setup yet, so I cannot look myself. Thanks for your help. <comment27874> I'm too much of an Apple nerd to remember the Windows control panels with anything other than abject horror ;) <comment41237> How do I disable "touch click"? That's the stuff that makes the cursor jump while I'm typing. And I hate hate hate it. Actually I just found this Touchpad++ driver. Gonna try it next: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2436935?start=0&tstart=0 <comment272794> This gotta be the accepted answer.. maybe it was not avaliable when the question came up, but from now on THIS ONE ROCKS..... <comment312610> Perfect and simple answer
