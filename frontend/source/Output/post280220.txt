How to change the default shortcut for "move focus to next window" to something else? <body> On Slovenian keyboard it's impossible to click the default shortcut.  <answer280221> Go to "System Preferences" - "Keyboard" - "Shortcuts" - "Keyboard" - hold the option key and left mouse click on the current shortcut on the right side from "Move focus to next window" - then enter your new keyboard shortcut.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gb1Va.png" alt="enter image description here"  suppicture of UK defaults showing different backtick/supbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQGp9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment352409> If you have time, it might be useful to add the Slovenian default to this question, as we're trying to add info for as many international versions as possible - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193937/shortcut-for-toggling-between-different-windows-of-same-app <comment352410> @Tetsujin will add an answer there as well. <comment352414> Thank you for that - the keys are so difficult to figure out if you don't use that language or layout. I did post a comment under your answer there, because I'd love to be able to add one more working default to our growing list.  Thanks for helping out :) <comment352415> Apologies for tagging you in so many replies. Again, I've edited another picture into your answer just to give some comparison [rather than post another answer as a discussion which is not good for the SE format.] We can always tidy up these comments afterwards. The key command for window drawer doesn't seem to be a 'backtick' `\`` but some kind of 'vertical apostrophe'. I've posted the UK defaults as a picture, showing the backtick as a distinction.
