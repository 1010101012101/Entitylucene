Upgrade components or whole computer? <body> I've got a 2.3 retina Macbook Pro from 2012. I'm debating getting a new one or updating the components.  I'm thinking about getting a Samsung 850 ssd and 8GB of extra ram — to bring me up to 16GB.   Worth spending the money this way or just as well to move to a new machine?  <comment182465> Do you have an SSD now? The only thing that might hold you back is graphics performance, but as long as you not trying to run the newest games with maxed out settings, it's probably worth upgrading your existing machine instead of buying a new one. <comment182514> It does have the SSD that came with it. I'm just wondering if the Samsung 850 would be faster than that. <comment182613> Start with RAM and see what that does for you. I'm not convinced a newer SSD would necessarily gain that much performance.
