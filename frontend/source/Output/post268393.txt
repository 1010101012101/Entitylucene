Import single .eml file with multiple emails into Apple Mail <body> In Apple Mail on macOS, when I am in my inbox, I can shift select strongmultiple/strong emails and drag them into a finder folder. This creates a strongsingle/strong .eml file that is the size of all the emails combined. Looking at the file with a text editor, all the emails appear to be in the file.  Unfortunately, I've done this with some emails that I have deleted from Apple Mail and need to re-import them. If I try How to import .eml files into Mail?, only the first email from the file is imported and the other ones are missing.  emHow do I import the .eml file such that all the emails inside of it appear in a mailbox?/em  FYI: I am now aware that I probably should have done a full mailbox export rather than trying to drag and drop them, so this question is related to emails already in the .eml format and not on how to properly export emails.
