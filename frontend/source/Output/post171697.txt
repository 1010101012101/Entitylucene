How to find xcode headers on OSX <body> I'm writing a C program that links to libxml2:  precode#include &lt;libxml/tree.h&gt; #include &lt;libxml/parser.h&gt; /code/pre  On Linux the libxml2 headers are in code/usr/include//code and the compiler finds them automatically. However in OSX, the path of the headers depends on the version of the OS. On Yosemite, they are in:  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk/usr/include/libxml2 /code/pre  But on other versions of OSX they might be in another dir. I need to pass this path to the compiler in the codeCPPFLAGS/code variable to make it work. How can I find the appropriate include directory (without using autoconf) across versions of OSX?
