3 Monitors in a row and I want the dock in the middle <body> I have an iMac 27 inch with a 22 inch monitor to the left and a 23 inch monitor to the right. I want the dock to be in the middle and want all monitors to be arranged from left to right. I keep my dock on the left hand side of my monitor. So when I position my monitors left to right it moves to the most left monitor.   Is there a way I can force the dock to stay on the middle monitor and not move to the left monitor?  Software version 10.11.1  <answer217475> Switch off 'Displays have separate Spaces' in System Prefs  Mission control.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Crzna.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then set the middle monitor to be the primary inbr System prefs  Displays  Arrangementbr by dragging the menu bar to that monitor    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ja7dx.png" alt="enter image description here"  After the question edit -br I'm afraid if you want the Dock on the left edge there is no way to achieve this. The above solution only applies if you have the Dock at the bottom, otherwise it has nowhere to 'sit' &amp; will always go to the first 'edge' it can find, which in this case is the left side of the left monitor.  You could try looking at something like DragThing instead, which can be anchored anywhere. I actually anchor mine to the right of my left monitor on a 2-screen setup, which effectively puts it where the red bar is on this image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ftIbt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment262954> can you state the software version of your mac? e.g. osx 10.9.2 <comment263028> This didn't produce what I am looking for. Thanks! <comment263029> Then edit your question to be more specific. <comment263049> Have you dragged the monitors to the desired positions?  (The blue squares can be arranged as desired.) <comment266825> I updated my question. <comment266892> Ahhh… now it makes sense… but the answer is now "No, it cannot be done" I'm afraid. The dock would have nowhere to 'sit'. You could try looking at something like [DragThing](http://www.dragthing.com/english/about.html) instead, which can be anchored anywhere.
