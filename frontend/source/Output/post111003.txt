How can I fake ethernet interface on osx to log on app store? <body> Is there a way to fake an ethernet interface or port on a grilled one (MacBook Pro) except from a usb ethernet? Maybe through a bootloader? Chimera or Chameleon adding a key in codeboot.plist/code?  <comment130674> What exactly do you hope to gain by this? You realize that even if you could fake a network interface, it would not actually provide an internet connection, considering it's fake? This wouldn't allow you to login to anything, including the App Store. <comment130698> The question makes it sound like the App Store is unwilling to login over wifi when no ethernet cards are present. Could that be true? <comment134184> I already have wifi but I can't log into App store without a ethernet port so by faking it ,it could be possible.....
