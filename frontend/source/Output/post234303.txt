Could you execute the commands `sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0` and `sudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0` in an OS X Terminal application window. Edit your question and add the output. These commands will not change your computer. Your login password may be required. This is normal. Also, I need to know if Windows is installed in EFI mode. Add, to your question, the answer to the question posted [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/169680/does-windows-running-on-latest-apple-computers-see-boot-disk-partitioned-as-mb). <comment286528> David, i edited my question <comment286631> David , did you see my edited question, is it possible explain what is the best solution and how i can increase size of windows partition. <comment286633> Yes, I saw your updated post.
