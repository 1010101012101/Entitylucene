Is it possible to add iCloud Reminders to iCal calendars? <body> In iCloud, each Reminder is placed in a named list (called a "List" in the details dialog, and a "Calendar" in the context menu in iCal), but there seems to be no way to assign a reminder to an existing ("normal") iCal calendar (as there was with pre-iCloud "To Do" items).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GWSqn.png" alt="Reminder calendar context menu in iCal"   emIs there a way to assign a Reminder to an existing iCal calendar?/em  <answer29152> No. With iCloud and its supporting operating systems (iOS 5 and OS X 10.7.2), Apple has split the calendar stores on its online CalDAV servers to be either event-only, or task-only. Reminders sync to task-only calendars. See this Apple Support article for some details.  <comment33494> This is the same reason why you cannot sync reminders with Google Tasks, BTW. See [Question 27480](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/27480/11948). <comment33495> Does this also mean that one cannot drag a Reminder into a time slot on the calendar (as one used to be able to do)? <comment33496> And (presumably) calling a Reminder list a "Calendar" in the iCal context menu is a bit of a bug. <comment33497> Yup to both, though “bug” may be a bit harsh for the second one – I’d call it a UI glitch. Reminders have been shoehorned into iCal with the 10.7.2 upgrade, some rough edges are to be expected. Also keep in mind the terminology is only superficial; technically, both *are* calendars.
