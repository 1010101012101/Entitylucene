How to turn off spindle of internal HDD on MacBook from command line? <body> I'm going put SSD drive instead of DVD and move OS-X to SSD. Big capacity HDD I'm gonig leave to have some place for large multimedia data and archives.  So I whant keep HHD in spindle off mode most time and mount it just on demand, what should I do to prevent HDD to be mounted and powered while system boot (after restart) and how to manage spindle with the command line?  Thank you!  <answer12076> to disable the drive from mounting during boot :  Find the uuid of the drive (in terminal):  precodediskutil info /Volumes/[name] /code/pre  Then create a new file called /etc/fstab and in it put  precodeUUID=34DFD44D-489C-1C22-01D8-DFDF288C102F none hfs rw,noauto 0 0 /code/pre  just replace the UUID above with the actual UUID of the drive.  Use the following command to view a list of drives/partitions  precodediskutil list /code/pre  And then issue the mount command to mount the drive  precodesudo mount /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/DriveName /code/pre  Obviously change the disk id and mount folder to suit your system.  <answer17009> codesudo diskutil eject /dev/disk1/code will turn off spindle  <comment12622> Better use `diskutil mount [name]` and `diskutil umount [name]`. <comment12639> Why it is better?
