How do I remove the restriction passcode on my iPad? <body> My younger brother, while playing with my iPad, switched on the restriction passcode for in-app purchase and when asking him he had forgotten the password. I asked some of my friends, they told me that there is no other way than restore. Upon hearing them I was really sad to know that I have to lose all my work.  I will be pleased if anyone could tell me some other way get the passcode than to restoring it. If any thing can be done after jail breaking it, it will not be a problem for me, I'll do it.  If restoring is only the method please tell me about restoring it and what I will lose after restoring my iPad as I do not have any backup.  <answer55540> I don't know for sure if there is any way for jailbroken devices to bypass this.  If you have a backup, you can restore to it. The only things you will lose are any changes you have made since your last backup. However, you will still be able to retrieve any songs and apps downloaded via iCloud.  If you do not have a backup, you will have to start from scratch. Backing up the device after the password was changed will store the password in the backup, so there is no other option.  <answer55584> It is possible, I have done it before on my sister's iPad, the passcode is stored in a plist file in the iPad backup. sI will return when I find what the plist file is called./s  Also note that synchronising with a computer will create a backup on your computer.  So I have looked it up, this appears to strongonly work in iOS 4/strong. I see a possible way around it in iOS 5 strongbut I have not tested this new method/strong.  ol liFind your backup folder.

Deleting this resets the toggles back to default (after the final reboot) and takes care of that part of the problem. But since a passcode was already defined, the "keychain-2.db"   <answer84089> The restrictions password can be reset by adding a PIN to the Springboard preferences file in iOS 6.  Easier said than done!  The instructions below worked for my iPad - and no jailbreak required.     They are, with a few minor changes, from Apple Support Community starting from about the 8th page:  ol liDownload iBackupBot/li liConnect iPhone/iPod/iPad via USB/li liBackup device to iTunes/li liClose iTunes (leave your device plugged in to your computer)/li liOpen iBackupBot - this will open all device backups that it can find/li liSelect your backup from the left column/li liSort right hand pane by Path and locate "Library/Preferences/com.apple.springboard.plist" (there may be two files named this; try them both) and double-click to open/li liExtracted it (and only it) to the desktop.  Do this by Checkmark the file, then select the Extract Icon (or File - Export menu), then select the checkbox that says only that file and the other checkbox that says something about Info about the file.  Two files will appear on your desktop - one ending in plist and the other ending in .info. /li liEdit com.apple.springboard.plist with you favourite plist editor (e.g. Xcode)/li liLook for and change the string for "SBParentalControlsFailedAttempts" to 0/li liAdd in   precode&lt;key&gt;SBParentalControlsPIN&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1234&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  after  precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;countryCode&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;us&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre/li liSave your changes, and return to iBackupBot/li liImport the modified plist.  It is now in the backup!/li liExit iBackupBot/li liOpen iTunes and use Restore Backup to your device/li liAfter restore is done and phone restarts the password should be 1234./li /ol  Amazing!  But use at your own risk.  And, just to repeat, I got all this from an Apple Support Community discussion.  Nothing is original.  <answer224326> There's a tool that can recover the restrictions passcode from an unencrypted backup, called empinfinder/em. Download the tool at the pinfinder github page, make an strongunencrypted/strong backup and follow the instructions.  <comment63757> Aren't you required to enter the restrictions password before wiping/restoring the device? <comment63787> DO you mean the in app purchase - or the passcode to lock - if the firmer go into iTunes store on a computer as follow the instructions for lost password <comment63822> Oh, right. But wouldn't putting the device in DFU not require the restrictions passcode? <comment114670> I want to say this works!. I just did it on my Ipad3. In fact they have updated Ibackupbot to make it even easier than the above directions. You no longer need Xcode and you can restore the springboard.plist right to your Ipad. After selecting your backup, search for springboard, then edit that file with Ibackupbot's editor and restore that selected file. Works like a charm! <comment301871> And how can we do it for Linux distributions as far as IbackupBot is only for Windows and Mac?
