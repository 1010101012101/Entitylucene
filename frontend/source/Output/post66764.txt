How to change bookmarks in Firefox shortcuts with right mouse button? <body> If I right click on a bookmark in my shortcuts, there are no options to modify it. Usually in other operating systems, you can change a bookmark with the right mouse button.  (The only way I found out to modify them is via the main menu.)  <answer66773> If you select 'Show All Bookmarks', the Bookmark Library will open.  You can then right-click there and change.  You are quite right in that you cannot right click a menu item in OS X and have it perform a secondary function (not in any of the major browsers anyway).  So the quick way to achieve what you want is - Shift-Command B to bring up the Bookmark Library.  <answer66777> It seems like that behaviour was never been implemented in Firefox on OS X.  See this bug report.   But you can use kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdB/kbd to get to the bookmarks menu and there you can edit all bookmarks by right-clicking.  <comment78626> Thx this helped but its a shame that it is not (yet hopefully) implemented...
