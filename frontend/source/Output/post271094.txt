Problems with HTTPS images in Mac Outlook 2016 <body> Recently we tried switching over our email signature icons from hosting them on our non-https public website to hosting them on Box and then referencing them using direct linking.  The images render and for the most part this seems to be going fine. However, there is a delay as the images are drawn into the email signature now. (I'm assuming the delay is caused by setting up the HTTPS handshake and such)    For the most part this is only a visual annoyance, however we have one person using Outlook 2016 for Mac, and if that user tries to reply to an email that has the Box direct links in the signature, the email client appears to actual freeze up while it attempts to resolve each of the images.  I've looked at the messages in Console and do see the resolution/https handshake steps performed by Outlook.  We can recreate the behavior on a different install of Outlook on a different Mac.  This doesn't happen if we're using the non-https links, and while there is a delay for the images to load when using Webmail or Outlook 2016 (Windows) it never seems to cause the email client to freeze up in this manner.    We have 5 images in the signature, none of them are 'large'.br Has anyone else seen this and come up with an alternative.  It doesn't seem to affect the actual user's signature because Outlook does some kind of manipulation to the signature and doesn't appear to be actually trying to resolve the graphic each time.  Thanks!  <comment341387> I did some more work on this and serving the files from AWS S3 instead of Box, display some delay, but does not cause Outlook for Mac to beachball as reliably as the Box images did.  I'm following up with Box at this point.
