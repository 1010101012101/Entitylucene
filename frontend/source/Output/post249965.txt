Change spotlight's calculator to degrees? <body> I use spotlight to perform calculations constantly, but at the moment the type of project I'm working on measures all angles in degrees.  Is there a way I can make spotlight's trigonometric functions default to degrees instead of radians?  <answer249966> Simply add a strongd/strong to the trigonometric function and it should work.   Example: emsin(x)/em  emsinstrongd/strong(x)/em. emsin(1)/em=0.8414... emsinstrongd/strong(1)/em=0.0174...  <comment310194> Thank you, perfect; I was completely unaware that this existed.
