Select text field that is not focused without losing selection <body> Lets assume I selected text in a text field and focused another (in the same application, e.g. Xcode's assistant editor), so the first one is no longer the first responder. The selection will appear gray.  Is there a way to return focus to the first text field without losing the selection?  <answer262082> Either use Cmd/Tab to cycle round to the app, or simpler, click the window's title bar...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Ctyx.png" width="450"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJVD1.png" width="450"   <comment328281> That will not work if you have multiple text fields  as I mentioned and the one that you want to select is currently not in focus. <comment328292> Then I've no idea what you mean, sorry
