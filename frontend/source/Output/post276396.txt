Services missing in Finder menus on one of my Macs, same service runs fine on another <body> My wife has hundreds of Word docs that would best be handled as a handful of concatenated docs.  Going from AskDifferent and other sources, I coded a simple Automated service on my (employer-issued) MacBook Pro.  It uses an action "Combine Word Documents" from Microsoft Word/Office (2016).  It accepts selected documents and passes them to the Word action.  On my own MBP, I installed it and I can invoke it from the Finder using the Finder-Services menu or the contextual menu, and it leaves me with an open concatenated document.  I put it on my wife's MacBook Pro (issued by a different employer) and I found that the Word actions were not available.  We contacted her help desk and they installed the actions remotely.  Now I can see the actions in Automator and Automator says it's installed them in Services but I see only a handful of Services under Finder-Services and the context menu doesn't have a Services submenu at all.  On my MacBook I have Xcode installed, the Scripts menu activated, and various other software development supports.  I also have OmniFocus 2 which installed some Services.  I have Accessibility enabled for a few apps as well.  Could these be what makes the service work on my Mac and not on hers?  I keep thinking there's a really simple thing here that I'm missing.  Thanks in advance for any help!  [tweak/bump/plead-for-help 03-21]
