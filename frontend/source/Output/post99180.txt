Retina Nvidia Control Panel Settings for Gaming <body> I've had a retina MBP for about a year now. I want to start using it for gaming. I have read that I need to change the Nvidia Panel Settings. Does anyone know specifics on what I should change to optimize gaming performance? thanks  FYI this is for Battlefield 3  <answer99187> Here are my settings for BF3 - I also have a rMBP (15"). You can modify these settings under strongManage 3D Settings/strong in the NVIDIA Control Panel:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OWyLP.png" alt="NVIDIA BF3 Settings"  I leave everything else to default, except I also turn off emAnisotropic Filtering/em.  For the above settings to take effect, the following setting must also be set under strongAdjust Image Settings with Preview/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ULAS.png" alt="Use the advanced 3D image settings"  hr  Also, don't forget about BF3's settings. I use Realmware BF3 Settings Editor to edit settings out of the game.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJFDP.png" alt="BF3 Settings"
