non-apple headset on ipad <body> I tried using my non-apple headset on ipad and it worked. This same headset is what I used on my android phone, but when I plugged it on my phone it won't work anymore. There's no headset logo appearing on my screen. Does this have anything to do about plugging the headset to the ipad?   <answer287424> No, not as such.  You might have damaged the headset or the plug on the Android phone inadvertently, but it is not because you have plugged the headset into an iPad.  <comment362900> I guess so. It's still working on the ipad just not on the android phone anymore. I plugged it on my windows laptop, the sound's just not the same anymore. I guess I'll just have to buy a new one. Thanks for the reply.
