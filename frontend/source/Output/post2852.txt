Sending link in Safari via IM <body> Does anyone know of a Safari mechanism (extension in Safari 5, perhaps), that will allow a person to send the current URL via instant message? Ideally, it would pop up a list of contacts.  <answer2935> If you are using Adium, you can send the current Safari link by clicking on the toolbar item "Insert link to active page in Safari" on the chat window with a contact.   If you need to send it directly from Safari, you may need to create an automator action or applescript service.  <comment3471> That works for me. I've been using a lot since you mentioned it. Thanks.
