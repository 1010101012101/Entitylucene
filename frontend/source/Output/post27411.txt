Is it possible to change file status (from read only to read and write) for multiple files/folders at once? <body> I moved all my web files/folders from my default MAMP directory to a more manageable location. Now all the files and folders have been changed to read only.   I figured out how to change the status per one by one, but that would take a lot of time. Is there a way to change all the files and folders to "read and write" all at once  <answer27418> Open terminal and try the following; putting the path of your new directory behind the /:  precodechmod -R o+rw /path/to/your/new/directory /code/pre  -R means recursively change the permissions of all files in the directory, with the arguments ( o+rw ):  precodeo ( the other users), alternatively u (for user) or g (for group) r ( read ) w ( write ) /code/pre  <answer27431> Better to just give the permissions you're looking for:  precodechmod -R g+w Music /code/pre  -R -- recursivebr g+w -- give write privileges to the group (which includes osx system-level users)br Music -- the relative (or /Music for an absolute) path to the new Folder.    Obviously, in case you didn't figure it out, you need to run this in Terminal.app
