Open many links at once in Safari <body> Can several links be opened at once in Safari? Imagine you are on a page with a lot of links:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMsJk.png" alt="enter image description here"  Would it be possible to select all the links and open them all in one single Command-click? As such:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X13YQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am often finding myself Command-clicking links for dozens of minutes a day, and wishing I could open more links all at once. Surely I'm not the only person in this situation!  <answer274586> There is a way to do something close - it involves adding a bookmarklet to Safari and selecting that once you're on the page.   However, this will either open only the hyperlinks you've selected (i.e. highlighted) on the page or it will open strongall/strong hyperlinks found on the page if you haven't highlighted any. In other words, it doesn't work in the kbdCommand/kbd + click manner you want.  If you're interested, here's the process to set this up:  ol liVisit any page using Safari/li liPress kbdCommand/kbdkbdD/kbd to add a bookmark to the page you just visited /li liIn the highlighted field that appears in the window, change the text to something like emOpen all hyperlinks/em/li liPress kbdOption/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdB/kbd to edit bookmarks/li liFind the bookmark you just added and right-click on it/li liSelect Edit Address... from the context menu/li liThis should highlight the URL. Press kbdDelete/kbd to remove it/li liNow paste the following code where the URL was previously:/li /ol  codejavascript:(function(){var n_to_open,dl,dll,i; function linkIsSafe(u) { if (u.substr(0,7)=='mailto:') return false; if (u.substr(0,11)=='javascript:') return false; return true; } n_to_open = 0; dl = document.links; dll = dl.length; if (window.getSelection &amp;&amp; window.getSelection().containsNode) { /* mozilla */ for(i=0; i&lt;dll; ++i) { if (window.getSelection().containsNode(dl[i], true) &amp;&amp; linkIsSafe(dl[i].href)) ++n_to_open; } if (n_to_open &amp;&amp; confirm('Open ' + n_to_open + ' selected links in new windows?')) { for(i=0; i&lt;dll; ++i) if (window.getSelection().containsNode(dl[i], true) &amp;&amp; linkIsSafe(dl[i].href)) window.open(dl[i].href); } } /* /mozilla */ if (!n_to_open) { /*ie, or mozilla with no links selected: this section matches open_all_links, except for the alert text */ for(i = 0; i &lt; dll; ++i) { if (linkIsSafe(dl[i].href)) ++n_to_open; } if (!n_to_open) alert ('no links'); else { if (confirm('No links selected. Open ' + n_to_open + ' links in new windows?')) for (i = 0; i &lt; dll; ++i) if (linkIsSafe(dl[i].href)) window.open(dl[i].href); } } })();/code  ol start="9" liPress kbdReturn/kbd to accept the code/li /ol  To make this work, open any page in Safari and then select the bookmarklet. One of the following things will happen:  ul liif you haven't highlighted any hyperlinks on the page, the code will proceed to open all hyperlinks in a separate tab/li liif you've highlighted emx/em number of hyperlinks, then the code will proceed to open those selected hyperlinks in separate tabs/li /ul  strongIMPORTANT:/strong If this doesn't work for you, ensure that you have Javascript enabled. You can do this via Safari  Preferences  Security.  strongOne more thing/strong - I have tried many times to get the above javascript to work as a Service in Safari (thinking that would be better than the embookmark/em approach), but have never been able to get it to work. On the off-chance you do, please share how. :)  <comment345291> For anyone who is open to using another browser, there are many extensions for firefox and chrome that do this. For Chrome I'd recommend [Linkclump](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkclump/lfpjkncokllnfokkgpkobnkbkmelfefj) and for Firefox [Multi Links Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-links-plus/) <comment354279> Thank you for this comment. [Sleipnir](http://www.sleipnirbrowser.com) has a function [that does this natively](http://imgur.com/a/bI2fy).
