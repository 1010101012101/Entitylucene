how to execute mkdir in /home/ directory <body> I want to create a directory 'administrator' in my /home/ directory but it won't allow me as it alway returns the error Operation not supported. Any ideas?  precodeRoberts-MacBook-Pro:home robert$ pwd /home Roberts-MacBook-Pro:home robert$ sudo mkdir administrator mkdir: administrator: Operation not supported /code/pre  <answer88805> code/home/code is used as a mount point for the automounter (see code/etc/auto_master/code and code/etc/auto_home/code), you can't create your own directories in there.  If you are looking for a place to store common administrator stuff shared between different administrators, create a directory in either code/Users/(any admin account)/code or code/usr/local/share/code and make it accessible to all members of the admin group.  <comment104354> ok noted, thanks for the reply!
