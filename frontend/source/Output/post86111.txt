MplayerX playback positions <body> MplayerX, not only remembers what I've watched but also is able to resume playback at a later invocation.  As stated here "MPlayerX saves playback positions in plist file ~/Library/Application Support/MPlayerX/bookmarks.plist"  Can someone please explain what the values in the plist file mean?   precode&lt;key&gt; file://localhost/abc.m4v &lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;33.795867&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  clearly one is the name of the file but what does the numerica value signify?  How can I translate 33.79... to something meaningful like "70% viewed" or "50 minutes viewed".  Thanks!  <answer86125> I tested it, it is the number of seconds from the beginning of the video.
