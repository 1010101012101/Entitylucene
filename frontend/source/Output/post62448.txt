Find original sales information of MacBook by serial number <body> Is there any way to figure out where my MacBook was sold and what the price was, by serial number only?  I know how to get information from Apple based on a serial number, but they did not tell me where it was sold or how much it was sold for.  <answer62452> EveryMac.com lists the original US retail price. You can look up the machines by model name, code and more identifiers: click here  <answer62454> In addition to Max Ried's answer, several more sites share EveryMac.com's functionality, including the following:  ul liPowerBookMedic/li liApple Serial Number Info/li lihttp://www.chipmunk.nl/klantenservice/applemodel.html (English translation is on the site)/li liApple support website (this is really a search for tech specs, and I think you've already mentioned it in your question,  but you can also search by serial numbers here)/li /ul  <comment72130> What i would like to know is the final price. With fees, discount etc ... is it possible ? and where it was buyed <comment72132> The funny thing is, these all websites provide absolutely different production week number :) but it's not a big deal, the most important isssue: they all does not provide what was the final price (with taxes, discounts etc) <comment72197> that's interesting. as for the final price, i think the closest you're going to get is the original retail price...but I'll update this if I find anything else <comment233698> Do you know the source of this information?
