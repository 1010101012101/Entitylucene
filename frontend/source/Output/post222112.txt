Maximize window to the content of the window? <body> I need to capture the whole content of a window (without the scrollbars) to an image file using strongCMD - Shift - 4, Space, Click Window/strong.   The content could vary so that it becomes larger than the screen. The window uses scrollbars for users to be able to see all content, but for screen capturing scrollbars will hide the content.  To capture the whole content of window I would need to maximize the window so that the scrollbars disappears.  An example could be a web browser like Safari were the content depends on the web page.  Are there any OS X functionality or App that makes it easy to do this?
