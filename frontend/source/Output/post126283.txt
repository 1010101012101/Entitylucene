Mac App Store opens to blank screen; cannot switch between menu options <body> Today I tried opening the App Store to update some software, but when it opens I am left with a blank screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kASoem.png" alt="Blank App Store Screen"  Also, when I click on the menu items in the top bar, multiple items will highlight in blue (but the blank screen will not change):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1bbe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone know why this is happening? I am using Mac OSX 9.1 (Mavericks).  <answer126347> I had the same problem today..tried rebooting and working fine now.    <answer145802> I'm new to Mac and I thought my App Store wasn't working as all buttons were greyed out. Turns out I had no Internet connection :-(  I feel a bit stupid but you'd think OSX would pop up a quick error message telling me that.  <answer146917> I killed all codestore*/code processes in Activity Monitor. Then relaunched App Store and it started working.  <answer147971> I just had this problem, poked around online, and solved it by resetting the NVRAM.  It's generally my second go-to solution if rebooting doesn't fix it.br Here are the Mavericks NVRAM reset instructions:br http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14222?viewlocale=en_US     strongResetting NVRAM/strong        ol   liShut down your Mac.  /li   liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. /li   liTurn on your Mac.  /li   liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound.  /li   liHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time.  /li   liRelease the keys./li   /ol   <answer156627> Found Safari would not open any sites, however VNC worked fine.  Go to Preference, Network, advance button at bottom, then look at the DNS tab.  I found both DNS Servers and Search Domains were blank.  Added my DNS info and Domains to search. Started to work. :)  <answer186261> Same problem. Tried all the solutions mentioned in this and other threads. Opened iTunes on a whim and saw the system could not authenticate the various CERTS associated with Apple. Looked that up. Found that the solution was to purge your current key store and then reboot. Voila.  In my case, I'm assuming my keystore "corruption" happened because of a system lock up which required a hard reboot. But this solved it.  <answer194925> Mine would always freeze when trying to open it, I tried killing the processes, signing out through iTunes, restarting, and nothing worked. I ended up updating the OS and iTunes through terminal and once I restarted the app store worked again!  From terminal, typing      softwareupdate -l   will give you the available updates. Then you can install them doing something similar to:      softwareupdate -i OSXUpd10.10.4-10.10.4   based off the list of available updates.

Killed storeuid process under my user account, opened App Store and it was fixed.  <answer223086> First, close the app store or itunes, etc. I fixed this by opening a terminal, then getting a super user terminal: sudo su - enter your password now be careful. You are root.  Next we want to kill all the App Store related processes. This doesn't hurt anything. Let's find them using the ps command and then using the grep search utility to get down to what we want.  precodeMacBook-Pro:~ root# ps -ef |grep store |grep -vi google   501  9284     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:08.90 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storeassetd   501  9349     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:00.73 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storeinappd   501  9353     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:01.91 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storedownloadd   501  9459     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:00.17 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storelegacy /code/pre  The second column is the process ID we want. We want to use the kill command:  precodekill 9284 9349 9353 9459 /code/pre  The numbers will be different on your PC. Open up app store and it should work! I have also read other ways - removing some verisign keys from the key chain app, and others, but this is what fixed me.  <answer233270> I've been having the same issue under OS X 10.11 El Capitan where the App Store would open to a blank page and no errors were listed.  The main solutions I have seen on multiple sites are:  ol liKill "store" Processes (see this thread)/li liZap NVRAM (Used to be called PRAM) [Reboot and hold down command-option-p-r until it cycles through the reboot sound 2-3 times]/li liUse the terminal commands to delete preference files (plist)/li liRemove Anti-Virus/Mal-ware software/li liCheck network settings and remove any proxies/li liIn the App Store Go to the Store menu and "Sign Out"/li /ol  #4 and #5 didn't apply to me  I did perform #3 but didn't see any help from that.  What worked for me was a combination of killing the processes (#1), restarting the App Store, and "Sign Out" (#6). Which worked great -- I had a bunch of pending updates.  But then I rebooted and the issue of the empty App Store came back. This time I tried just the "Sign Out" and that didn't work. Killed the processes and opened the App Store and it worked.  I'm going to experiment with the NVRAM zapping and see if that works on a permanent basis. Otherwise I'll open up a bug report with Apple.  <comment147889> I don't know why that's happening, but the first step I'd take is to restart <comment153836> Seriously, all this time and the best answer we have is "reboot'? I have had this problem for months, and I reboot, then it works for a little bit, then the problem comes back again. I shouldn't have to reboot constantly just to go to the App Store. Very annoying. <comment229208> Thanks. It was killing storeagent in particular that fixed it for me. <comment253023> Nice, worked for me as well. <comment283807> Weirdly, not even a reboot fixed this problem. But manually killing these processes did it. <comment290507> It's always terrible when killing system processes solves a problem <comment295694> 2 years later and they still haven't fixed this.
