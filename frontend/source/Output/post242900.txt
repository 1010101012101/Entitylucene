Why can't Wacom tablet touch gesture work like Magic Trackpad <body> I recently got a Wacom graphic tablet, Wacom Intuos Art with multi-touch feature, this is my first ever graphic tablet, and I immediately fall in love with it, the stylus drawing side of it.  Here is the thing, before I buy, I am keep comparing it with Magic Trackpad's touch capabilities. The only gesture of the Wacom tablet that I feel really close to work like Magic Trackpad is two fingers fluid scrolling. The others, like mouse tracking with one finger, can't really track small movement nicely/precisely, only large movement will work well.  The tablet also provide four fingers swipe left/right to switch between desktop spaces. If you use Magic Mouse/Trackpad you can intercept in between the animation, you can reverse it if you want. But, the Wacom tablet kind of like just triggering the shortcut kbdCTRL/kbd kbdâ†’/kbd when you perform the gesture.  I am so new to graphic tablet, I want to know is there any 3rd party software/driver I can use to enhance the experience of this graphic tablet?  <answer242932> Though I lack a Wacom tablet to test it myself, this post seems to indicate that BetterTouchTool supports Wacom tablets to some degree.  BetterTouchTool has a variety of features that will allow you to configure and bind gestures to actions.  <comment299085> I checked that page as well, my conclusion is BTT is a great software but really not taking graphic tablet as first class citizen. <comment299222> @KentLiau Unfortunately true: it wasn't designed with that in mind. You could write to the developer, he's been known to be quite receptive to feedback and active within various communities.
