Problem downloading some urls with cURL on OSX <body> I have problem downloading some applications with homebrew. strongI could get them when the download urls start with https:///strong  strongbut curl fails when the urls start with, ftp:// or http:///strong   For example, I want to install GMT (generic mapping tools) with homebrew on my Mac OS 10.7.4. and I get the error below. I think curl has problem downloading .tar.gz file, strongbut I have no problem downloading the same file with Firefox/strong.  precode$ brew install homebrew/science/gmt ==&gt; Tapping homebrew/science Cloning into '/usr/local/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-science'... remote: Counting objects: 553, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (551/551), done. remote: Total 553 (delta 2), reused 67 (delta 1), pack-reused 0 Receiving objects: 100% (553/553), 432.61 KiB | 367 KiB/s, done.

So I downloaded the .tar.gz files for each dependency. They all worked until downloading a .zip file codeproj-datumgrid-1.5.zip/code which looks like a data file used by the dependency codeproj/code.   Maybe I need to rename the .zip file downloaded somehow so that Homebrew recognize it. Or should I need to put it elsewhere . How does homebrew use these files?   precode$ brew install homebrew/science/gmt ==&gt; Installing gmt from homebrew/homebrew-science ==&gt; Installing dependencies for homebrew/science/gmt: proj, libgeotiff, geos, readline, sq ==&gt; Installing homebrew/science/gmt dependency: proj ==&gt; Downloading http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.1.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/proj-4.9.1.tar.gz ==&gt; Downloading http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.5.zip  curl: (7) couldn't connect to host Error: Failed to download resource "proj--datumgrid" /code/pre  <answer201336> Have you tried running  precodebrew update /code/pre  and   precodebrew updgrade /code/pre  before  precodebrew install homebrew/science/gmt /code/pre  Usually many problems with formulas may be solved by simply updating &amp; upgrading homebrew and its formulas!  <answer201339> It's likely you are seeing a network issue. To test that, in the window where things errored out, try the host command to make sure DNS is happy and then try a basic curl to check the server is up.  precodehost www.cmake.org curl www.cmake.org | wc -l /code/pre  The second command downloads the main page and counts the lines of text codecurl/code was able to retrieve. For me, I get:  precodewww.cmake.org has address 66.194.253.19    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed 100 28697    0 28697    0     0  53139      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 53142      426 /code/pre  ... so curl retrieves 426 lines of code.  At that point, you know the tools are fine and can check the actual resource that brew is trying to download - in this case  precodemaac:log miike$ curl http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.3/cmake-3.3.1.tar.gz | wc -l   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed 100 6423k  100 6423k    0     0   554k      0  0:00:11  0:00:11 --:--:--  799k    25239 /code/pre  The above command seems the same as using firefox, but if you get similar results from the command line, retry the codebrew install/code with a verbose flag to get extra debugging information:  precodebrew install -v homebrew/science/gmt /code/pre  <comment242683> Yes I did `brew update && upgrade` before `brew install homebrew/science/gmt`. <comment242689> I tried this and got `$curl www.cmake.org | wc -l   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed   0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:01:15 --:--:--     0 curl: (7) couldn't connect to host        0` <comment242693> Are you doing this from work? Is it possible, that you have to use a proxy server? To check, you could take a look at the Firefox settings or ask your administrator. <comment242695> I'm at the university. Firefox uses Auto-detect proxy. <comment242715> @NasoloAndrianoelina Nice - then your networking is the problem and not the brew. Try `curl --connect-timeout 10 --retry 3 --verbose http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.3/cmake-3.3.1.tar.gz | wc -l ` but you'll likely need to ask a follow on question if you can't make sense of the output from that command. @ ping me here if you ask a new question on debugging curl :-) <comment249916> Yes it was a networking problem and I could finally find a solution. The autodetect proxy was not working for curl and I asked the proxy from the administrator. From google: I added to the file '~/bash_profile' something like this 'http_proxy="http://mycache.mydomain.com:8080"' 'export http_proxy' <comment249947> Awesome news @NasoloAndrianoelina -  I would encourage you to answer that as a separate answer. I can sepe lots of people being stumped by this. Especially as MDM can set proxy settings for people behind the scenes and they may not be aware they are set.
