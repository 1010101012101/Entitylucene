Connect iphone to multiple output devices to play music <body> How can I output music from a iPhone to a Bluetooth speaker and at the same time output to another sound appliance where the iPhone is jacked into. Like a Bose stereo device.    <answer131083> Currently there's no way to do this with a stock iPhone. You could try Jailbreaking the phone and getting some 3rd party software that might allow it, but I'd recommend against that. Honestly I can't imagine Apple would ever build this functionality into iOS. There are ways to accomplish this in code, but I don't think Apple would approve an app that attempted to do this.  There is a 3rd party app by Rogue Amoeba called AirFoil that lets you send audio from an iOS device to multiple outputs. It doesn't do it in the way you described, but it does get the job done.

Streaming music and audio to a stereo system is what it is designed for.  Go to an Apple Store or other authorized Apple dealer and explain what you want to do and they can show you how it works.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n0P8z.png" alt="enter image description here"  2) Alternately, wire the headphone output from the iPhone into a semi-professional mixer board which was then connected to more than one amplifier and speaker device. This is equipment used by musicians for recording, and it would require some expertise to learn to use.  Here is a link to a list of small, inexpensive mixers on sale at Guitar Center.  Go to a local music store and tell them what you want to do and they can explain how to do it.  <answer144834> If you are trying to share to iOS devices check out:  Audibly  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audibly-make-your-music-heard./id882170258?mt=8  <answer146349> Use an out board sender/receiver unit.
