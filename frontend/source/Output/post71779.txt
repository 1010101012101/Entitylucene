Why is sudo running so many times? <body> I've just noticed that my mac has loads of sudo processes running â€“ why? What is causing them?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i841o.png" alt="Lots of sudos!"  <answer71780> The easiest way to determine what's going on here is to open a terminal and run  precodeps aux | grep sudo /code/pre  On my machine there are many lines, all that include:  precode/usr/libexec/StartupItemContext /usr/bin/open -a /Library/Application Support/iStat Server/DiskTool.app /code/pre  So, we know that it's from a start up item, specficially iStat Server.   As I don't use that app anymore, I'll uninstall it.
