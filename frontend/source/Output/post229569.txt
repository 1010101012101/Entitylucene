Kerberos password <body> First of all, I have no idea how Kerberos ended up in my Mac. I have tried to reset its password but I don't even know what is the ID to use.  So, please how do I reset Kerberos password when I have no clue about which server it is connecting to?  I am running El Capitan 10.11.3 on MacBook Pro.  No. I don't know Kerberos password. :(  <answer229570> Open keychain access, from the strongKeychain Access/strong menu select strongTicket Viewer/strong.  There you will see your kerberos tickets which you can select and then hit the strongChange Password/strong button.  This assumes that you know the current password.  If you don't, then you may need to provide more details in order to get help.
