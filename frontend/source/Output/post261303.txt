Does guest information stay saved? <body> If I am using a friends computer as a GUEST and then sign out. Can my information still be seen by the owner of the computer or does it get deleted??? Like I did t want them to see what I was researching ect ??  <answer261309> No, guest data is not permanent.  From Apple docs     Files created by a guest are stored in a temporary folder, but this folder and its contents are deleted when the guest logs out.   <comment327251> Unless that's on a FileVault drive or SSD, I don't think that would make it forensically clean, but would be more than enough to hide it from the casual observer.
