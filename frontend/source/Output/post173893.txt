Search result -> filename instead of name (For smart folders) <body> Can anybody help me out. I want to create a smartfolder with all my codemp3/code's. I renamed all my codemp3/code's to correct full name. For example:  precodePhil Collins - In The Air Tonight.mp3 /code/pre  When I create a smart folder. It shows all my codemp3/code's but with the name from metadata (ID3 tag) so only codeIn the air tonight/code. There is no way to select filename in the colums. This is really annoying.  Does anybody know a solution? Or another program that does the trick? Or a hack?  <answer174002> I don't think you can customize Finder in that way.  There is a third party program that does just what you want: HoudahSpot. This lets you add columns for any attributes known to Spotlight. There are hundreds to choose from.  Filename is one of the columns you can add. By default, HoudahSpot and many other applications on OS X show the "display name". This can be a localized version of the file name or something entirely different. E.g. Apple Mail stores messages in numbered .emlx files. It stores the message subject with Spotlight.  emFull disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahSpot./em  <comment204651> Can you add a screenshot (or link to one) of the smart folder?
