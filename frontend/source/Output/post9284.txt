Does Mac have something similar to a Linux loop device? <body> I am trying to work with some cd and hard drive images that I will run inside of QEMU. On Linux, I mount the images using the losetup command, but I notice Mac does not have this.  Is there something similar I could use instead?  <answer9288> Mac OS X has the Disk Images Framework for live mounting disk images. Although it primarily works with its own native formats such as .dmg, I believe it can also work with .iso's and other formats. You can use Disk Utility or the hdiutil command to mount disk images.   <answer243075> You can use codehdiutil/code for that. Basically, it does the same as codelosetup/code on Linux.  If you are planning to work with images with non-standard layouts or filesystems (for example, live CDs), make sure to pass code-nomount/code to codehdiutil attach/code, as otherwise it will complain that it couldn’t mount it (it tries to mount everything by default).  After the image is attached, it will appear in codediskutil list/code as an ordinary disk. You can work with it just like with a physical disc.  hr  Here is an example of mounting a live CD:  precode$ hdiutil attach -nomount path/to/file.iso /dev/disk2              FDisk_partition_scheme /dev/disk2s2            0xEF /code/pre  It prints the name of the new disk. Now we can see it:  precode$ diskutil list  &lt;...&gt;  /dev/disk2 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        +453.0 MB   disk2    1:                       0xEF                         12.6 MB    disk2s2 /code/pre  This is a live CD, it uses ISO 9660 file system. You can’t mount it using codediskutil/code, you have to use a special tool:  precode$ mount_cd9660 /dev/disk2 ~/tmp/mnt /code/pre  When you are done, unmount and detach:  precode$ umount /dev/disk2 $ hdiutil detach disk2 "disk2" unmounted. "disk2" ejected. /code/pre  <comment9833> I was trying to use the hdiutil command with attack -mount optional, since the images do not have a file system. However, I'm not sure what to do after that, since it does not appear anywhere.
