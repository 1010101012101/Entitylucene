Is there character spacing feature in PDFpen? <body> I am trying out the demo version of PDFpen and can't figure out a way to adjust the character spacing. My text edit ended up like this:  The first line is a result from PDFpen editing and the second line is the original. Please avoid obvious suggestion like using a different font.   I like to know if character spacing is available or not in PDFpen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDYz8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer91642> Yes, select the text, and choose codeFormat -&gt; Font -&gt; Kern -&gt; Loosen/code from the menu.  If you need to do this frequently, visit the Keyboard Shortcuts tab of the Keyboard system preferences, then select Application Shortcuts and add a shortcut for Loosen.
