How do I simulate a random VPN disconnect? <body> I'm trying to write an applescript that reconnects a VPN that gets disconnected (sort of like this one) and I want to test it to see if it works. One of the key parts of the script is being able to tell whether the VPN was disconnected by the user or by a network error. What other ways can I test if the script works other than waiting (maybe hours) for a VPN disconnection to occur?
