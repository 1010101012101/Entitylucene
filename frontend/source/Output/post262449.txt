iPad has a password after installing iOS 10 Update from iOS 8 <body> I was using my iPad em(iPad Air on iOS 8)/em yesterday and it asked me to update to iOS 10 and I selected to update it later and to do so automatically at night. Right after I pressed automatic update the iPad prompted me to enter in my Apple ID password, but I just ignored it and tapped cancel instead.   I woke up today and was prompted with an iOS 10 styled lock screen asking me to enter in a password which wasn't previously there. strongI'm not sure what password this is and if anyone knows what I could do to get the data off the device that would be great./strong  <comment328789> presumably it is the Apple ID that was first used to register the device. <comment328791> The password that it added is a system password like an alphanumeric password on the iPad. Could it be the Apple ID's password it added to the lock screen? Before the update the iPad never had a password on it. <comment328867> Possible duplicate of [Unlocking iPhone 4](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30270/unlocking-iphone-4)
