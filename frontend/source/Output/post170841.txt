Resizing Partitions <body> I cannot resize the HD of a new Mac Mini.  The Mac HD shows 700+ GB on one partition with Yosemite on it and another partition of 200+ GB named "Free Space" and I cannot figure out how it got there.

You'll probably need to try that, then see if you can drag the border of the main partition to resize, then hit the plus (+) to create a new partition. Nothing can use the free partition, so it won't hurt to try deleting it.  <answer170866> You cannot resize the active partition.  You need to boot into Recovery Mode which will let you and resize the main partition. Select the whole drive then the Partition tab.  http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4718  PS Make sure you have a Time Machine backup before doing anything.  <comment200940> Please upload a screenshot properly. Also open Terminal.app and enter `diskutil list` and `diskutil cs list` each followed by the enter key, copy the outputs and add it to your question by editing it. <comment201118> I've tried the Recovery Disk but to no avail.  I have the screen shot(s). Cannot use the - button to delete the free space partition and the main partition will not resize.  Guess I will just take the Mini back and get another one. Looks like my only way out.  The computer works fine but....... <comment201123> I cannot get the screen shots uploaded as screen shots.  Ia there a trick to it? <comment201159> hmm click 'edit' at the bottom of your question. Choose the passage in the editable text field where to place the pic: [example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/adv1h.jpg). Click on it and you will be asked to link a picture already online or upload one from your computer. Please also add the output of `diskutil cs list`.
