How to close the window of "None of your preferred networks available" in keyboard only mode <body> My trackpad is dead. I need to commit my repository with terminal. I reopen it, but it is still halfway behind a nasty window "None of your preferred networks available".   I am trying Command + W, but it closes the terminal, not the top window. Any suggestions?  <comment325164> Can you provide a screenshot of the window in question? <comment325166> Nope :((, it is beyond my Mac keyboard mana <comment325168> @Fyrefly It's the window shown when "Ask to join new networks" is enabled in System Preferences â†’ Network. <comment325182> Can you borrow or purchase a USB mouse? I always keep one handy just in case I need it. <comment325237> though not elegant, but practical, a mouse can help. the touchpad finally started working again.
