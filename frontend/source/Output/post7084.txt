Mac OS X Terminal [Use option as meta key] overrides backslash in spanish keyboard <body> I already posted this question in stackoverflow:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4811282/mac-os-x-terminal-use-option-as-meta-key-overrides-backslash-in-spanish-keyboar  but I was informed there that this is the right place to ask it.  I check "Use option as meta key" checkbox in Mac OS X Terminal, because I like to use emacs way of moving between words: M-f &amp; M-b.  But if I do that, I can't get the backslash (Option + º; i.e.: Option + key-at-the-left-of-1-in-spanish-keyboard). If I uncheck it, then I can input the backslash, but I don't have M-f &amp; M-b.  Is there a way to get both? This is driving me nuts!  <answer7090> And, as I already answered you on stackoverflow, the solution is to put the following line into your code~/.bash_profile/code, which remaps the unicode character "∫" (Unicode: E288AB, which is what is sent to your terminal right now in your desired configuration when you press Option + °) to the backslash character:  precodebind '"\033\xE2\x88\xAB"':'"\\"' /code/pre  <comment7836> Thanks a lot! That did the trick. <comment8444> Would you mind marking my Answer as the solution then? Also, you´re still having your question open as a duplicate on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4811282/mac-os-x-terminal-use-option-as-meta-key-overrides-backslash-in-spanish-keyboar <comment48382> Hm, but Alt-Shift-7 *gives* you the backslash without remapping something - am I missing something ??
