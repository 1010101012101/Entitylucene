I can no longer receive Calendar reminders via email <body> I have an iphone 6s. I use the calendar icon on the iphone for all my meetings and events.  I use hotmail for my emails. Up until not long ago I use to receive reminders for calendar events both as an on screen alert and also via an email.  For some reason I no longer receive the email reminder. I only receive the on screen alert.  To further clarify, I am still receiving email reminders for all my events which were set up before a certain date (can't pin point the date i started experiencing this issue) but not receiving email reminders for any events created after that date.   This is particularly annoying as the on screen alert disappears once you read see it on your screen and continue using your phone. The email serves as a more permanent reminder as it remains in your inbox until you delete it.  Could someone please let me know how i can start receiving email reminders again for all my calendar events.
