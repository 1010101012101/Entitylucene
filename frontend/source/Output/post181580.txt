Trouble with IMovie? <body> My friend can get iMovie for free on his iPhone, but I can't. I still have to pay $4.99 for the app. I've asked 3 other friends about the app and all of them get it free. Why can't I get this app?  <answer181584> Here is what Apple says:  Feb 3, 2015 - To qualify for these free apps, you need a device that was activated or purchased on or after September 1, 2013.   When you upgrade to iOS 8 on a qualifying device or buy a new device with iOS 8, you'll have access to these apps for free: strongiMovie/strong  <comment215950> what is your iPhone model ? and is it on IOS8
