How can I modify an input method? <body> I go back and forth between using a Dvorak keyboard layout and a Korean input method (2-Set Korean). The way that 2-Set Korean is set up, when a modifier key like kbd⌘ Command/kbd or kbd⌃ Control/kbd is depressed in combination with a regular key, the output follows the codeQWERTY/code layout. I would like the modified version to follow the Dvorak layout. I'm willing to go to some trouble in order to have this if it is possible.  I saw this question but I'm not sure whether or not the answer there has any relationship to my question.  <comment217065> I think to modify the layout in the Korean IM you would have to go into the KoreanIM app in system/library/input methods and see if you can find .keylayout and other files that could be modified to do what you want. <comment217095> @TomGewecke thanks, I've tried that; I have tried modifying the files inside KoreanIM.app in many different ways but have not had any luck changing even one character. I don't know if it's because I'm not doing something correctly to install or propagate the changes or because those .keylayouts are legacyfiles and the IM.app doesn't actually use them. Any suggestions? <comment217104> Sorry, no.  Perhaps there is an alternative Korean IM you can install which would offer more flexibility.
