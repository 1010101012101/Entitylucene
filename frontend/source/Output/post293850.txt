Is it possible to downgrade Apple Developer Company account to a standard Developer Account? <body> I have a weird use case. I have an Apple developer account with Private Limited, now we want to change that one to an individual account. Because of need to pay more for  D-U-N-S Number. But we don't want to close our account in which we have live apps.  <comment370833> Try calling Apple Developer. The link here is for [phone support](https://developer.apple.com/contact/phone/), which I highly reccomended for this basic support question.
