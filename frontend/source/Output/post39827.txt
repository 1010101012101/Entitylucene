Where are Microsoft Office for Mac My Templates stored? <body> Where do Word for Mac and Powerpoint for Mac store user templates?  <answer39828> In the English version of Word and PowerPoint 2011, Templates are stored inside your Home folder in code~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates/code. In other languages, the codeUser Templates/My Templates/code part is localized (e.g. codeBenutzervorlagen/Eigene Vorlagen//code in German).  The User's Library folder is hidden in 10.7 and later, but you can go there by holding down kbdoption/kbd while clicking the Go menu in the Finder, then selecting Library.  <answer213242> According to this page, and confirmed by experiment, the path has changed for Office 2016.  It is now code~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates/code.    Be aware that if you performed an upgrade of Office, you will still have the code~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates/code directory, but Powerpoint, at least, won't look in that location.  <comment45038> Great edit @patrix. Thanks for the "internationalization". <comment120620> THANK YOU! I used the Go to folder command and went straight to the folder. <comment144143> If you don't have such folder, here's what I've done. I created that folder manually and dragged a couple of templates I've found online and there they are! When I choose New From Template (PPoint), they showed. Thanks! <comment199796> I created the Meine Vorlagen Folder with the german name and it worked. The folder name is really translated not like the applications folder that only is translated in the finder and not on the file system. <comment201942> Note that if you are trying to navigate to this folder from within a program e.g. an open/save dialog then you need to hit  `Command + Shift + G` to bring up to Go To Folder dialog <comment281284> How like Microsoft... <comment310646> As those mentioned locations seem "default" you are also able to set your custom location by simply going to Word 2016 settings and setting the location for word. This will result in setting the location for PP as well. <comment318623> Hi @davemulligan, That answer was a step in the right direction but didn't work for me (El Capitan, Office 2016).  As much as I prefer reading text to watching instructional videos, I found watching [this tutorial video from MSFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUR0awIEm-Y) to be the only thing that helped me add the template. <comment329031> That location worked here (Sierra + Office 2016). Thank you.
