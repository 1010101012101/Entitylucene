How can I stop Finder from converting and loading videos to display in movie icons? <body> I want movies to be displayed simply as movie icons.  But currently, and for the past few years, Finder loads (and if it is a strange format converts) the video and then displays an icon showing a still from the movie. That is very very annoying. How can I switch that off?  <answer39317> To turn off the Finder's icon preview feature:  ul liRight click on the desktop  Choose 'Show View Options'/li liUncheck 'Show icon preview'/li /ul  <comment44498> I just noticed that it was switched off on my Mac Pro (which still for some reasons starts converting Windows Media movies when opening a folder) and I guess it switched off on my MacBook too, until the Lion upgrade.
