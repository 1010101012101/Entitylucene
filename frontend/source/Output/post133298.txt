Is it possible to make a style sheet for Safari's Top Site page? <body> Mavericks : is it possible to use a style sheet for Safari's Top Sites page?  Are there style sheet examples to draw from?  <answer133313> Unlike Chrome, Safari doesn't seems to use a webpage for the top sites but rather another programmatic view.   As you might have seen, the webinspector doesn't work on this page.   <comment157972> Yep, I did notice that I could not invoke the inspector.. Too bad.. Radar!?
