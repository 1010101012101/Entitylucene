How do I remove the Welcome Back at the top? <body> So whenever I launch a game that uses game-center I get a message on the top of the screen that says "Welcome Back (My Game Center username)". How do I remove this? It's really annoying and it stays there for like 6 seconds.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0F8jj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer239246> Open 'Settings  Notifications  Game Center' and turn off all notifications.  Your settings should match those in this image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpa5D.png" alt="Game Center notifications settings"  <comment293557> I'm not aware of a way to do that. You could just wait till the message disappears or play in airplane mode. <comment293558> @jaydm26 Yeah airplane would work, but the games I play in require Internet to play <comment293561> No it's not a push notification <comment293562> Not all notifications are push notifications. <comment293563> I tried and I still get it <comment293564> You turned off all notifications? <comment293567> Yep. Still didn't work <comment293569> updated my answer with an image to show what you should have your settings updated to. <comment293579> those are push notifications. I'll include a screenshot of what I mean in my question <comment293582> https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/35629/how-can-i-disable-the-welcome-name-banner-notification-for-game-center <comment293598> @NetherLinks no that's for the popup I have a different issue <comment293607> It's really not a notification in the sense of local/push notifications, and disabling notifications won't make a difference.
