deleate update reminders in osx 10.10.2 <body> I need to stay with OSX 10.10.2 because some legacy programs don't perform smoothly with later versions. Is there a way to completely prevent any OSX upgrade reminders from showing up?  <answer201541> To configure updates in OS X Yosemite:  Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongApp Store/strong  From there you can uncheck the settings for reminders on updates.  While you are at it, you may find other settings in the strongSystem Preferences/strong that are worth checking out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0A6T.png" alt="System Preferences App Store"
