How to change the keyboard for alphanumeric password on lock screen on iPod <body> I want to change the keyboard of my passcode to Japanese. Even if I change the language of my iPod to Japanese and get rid of the English keyboard, I still only can set my passcode in English. I can't find anything that will help me do this. If any of you know please help! Arigato!  <answer277514> strongGood morning!/strong report it to Apple support  Request them to investigate, ask them to inform you and also post "how to" on their website as well  Note: Usually Apple or other smartphones makes only post the most common situations or most common inquiry's answers   For those more specific questions, one has to ask them to investigate and post it  If there is an Apple support agent or technical support person that knows how to use his or her resources and is willing to investigate on it for more than 5 minutes, they may be able to get you an answer  strongThanks!/strong  <comment349293> This question was asked several months ago so it might not be morning there anymore.  Please edit your answer to include the steps ("how to") for making the change the OP requested.  If you don't know them, it's not a very good answer to tell them to ask Apple how to do it.
