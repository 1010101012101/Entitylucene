"Soft Return" character (Shift-Enter) on iOS? <body> How can I enter a soft return character (Shift-Enter) on iOS?  <answer189792> A soft line break is not supported by the iOS keyboard (nor, to my knowledge, by SwiftKey or Swype), but you can copy/paste an existing soft return from any other text.  I cannot give an example here, because the Stack Exchange markup doesn't know a soft return either. Instead, you can see this in action in the following Quora thread: How do I enter a soft return character (Shift-Enter) on iOS?  <answer189794> Extending zoagli's own answer, though again not a perfect solution as it adds potentially unwanted spaces you need to go back &amp; tidy up.  Copy/paste a soft return from somewhere, then in System Prefs  Keyboard  Text you can add a new Replace, for instance codesret/code, &amp; paste the soft return to the With column.  That will then propagate over iCloud to your other devices &amp; turn sret into a soft  return - though not on SE, as previously mentioned [unless you look at this answer in Edit]. It will also have a leading &amp; trailing space, which you may need to go back &amp; trim.  <comment225203> That sounds brilliant! However, I didn't get it to work on my iOS 8.3 (iPhone 5). It seems to save the keyboard shortcut _without_ the soft return (and saves a space character instead). <comment225392> Hmm... doesn't even seem to have propagated to my phone. It's a trick I've used for all kinds of things before- guess it just doesn't like this one:(
