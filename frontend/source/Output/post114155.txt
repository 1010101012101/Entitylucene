WD My Book for Mac External HD won't boot any more <body> I bought a 3T WD My Book for Mac external HD and use it with my iMac with OSX 10.8.5. I partitioned it into 5 partitions. There are three 30G partitions and two larger ones. The largest is used as a Time Machine backup. The 3 small ones each have 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 base OSX systems on them. The disk was booting properly from all of OSX partitions.  Now the OSX partitions will not boot. They do not (nor do the corresponding recovery partitions) show up when when I hold the option key down upon booting. I can see the hard disks and files on them. The Time Machine partition works normally.  I tried reinstalling the 10.8, 10.9 partitions and the install worked fine for each until the final reboot for user setup (Welcome to X). The files are visible but no boot . The partition scheme is GUID partition Table and the format is Mac OS Extended (Journaled).  Any ideas? Let me know if you need more information.
