Safari, open in another panel <body> When I open a link on Safari, it opens another tab overlapping the original, so to go back to the previous I have to browse all the other tabs. This is uncomfortable because in case I want to read the new link later, I have to make that passage. Is there an option to change card management?  <answer285170> You should do so: Settings - safaris - open links - in the background
