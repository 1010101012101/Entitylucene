Disable Spotlight indexing, save battery life <body> I am using my laptop with emvery limited/em battery availability. I need to save as much battery as possible.  ul liI would like to disable Spotlight indexing, how do I do that?/li liWhat else should I disable, even temporarily, to truly bmaximise/b savings? Services? Unix daemons? Is there a list?/li /ul  Thanks.  PS I have already:  ul lidimmed keyboard backlight (on a MacBook Pro)/li liswitched off WiFi (apart from this post)/li lidimmed screen backlight/li lidisabled discrete graphics/li liclosed non-vital apps/li /ul  <answer55583> Well, the immediate way is:  precodesudo mdutil -i off / /code/pre  from the command line (you will have to enter your admin password) to stop indexing immediately.  You might also want to add the following step:  precodesudo vim /etc/hostconfig /code/pre  (you might want to use a different editor than vim, YMMV)   Then, navigate to the entry  precodeSPOTLIGHT=-YES- /code/pre  and change it to   precodeSPOTLIGHT=-NO- /code/pre  SAVE the changes the exit the file.  BTW, have a look at iFixit on how to change the battery, it seems you could have much better use of the laptop that way.  <answer55595> I don't know if it'll really save anything battery-wise, but you might try codedefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool YES/code and then using codecmd-K/code to quit the Finder.  <comment63783> If you want both questions answered, you should split them up in different posts.
