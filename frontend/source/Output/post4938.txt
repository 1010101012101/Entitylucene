How to change AppleScript path to a Terminal-style path? <body> I have a custom Service that I've created in Automater (I'm on OSX 10.6.5). The Service executes an AppleScript which in turn executes a shell script. Here is the AppleScript:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     -- do shell script "/usr/bin/find " &amp; input &amp; " -type f -name .DS_Store -delete -print"     display alert "Path: " &amp; input end run /code/pre  The problem is, the path passed by the Service (in the variable codeinput/code) looks like:  precodeMacintosh HD:Users:Matthew:Documents:Programming:Apple Scripts: /code/pre  And for the command to execute properly, the path needs to look like:  precodeMacintosh\ HD/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple\ Scripts/ /code/pre  So, is there a way to translate the first path to the second path? I was hoping for a core function which handles this. But I suppose some kind of regex/find/replace/etc would work? I'm familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP, not with Cocoa/AppleScript/C. Any direction or suggestions would be great!  <answer4939> Ok...this was easier than I had realized. After some Googling, it looks like what I need here is the codePOSIX path of/code command. This converts a given path to a Unix style path, which is the type of path you would see/use in Terminal. So:  precodePOSIX path of input /code/pre  Gives me a path like:  precode/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple Scripts/ /code/pre  It seems to take into account that you just need a code//code at the beginning of the path, rather than the hard drive name. It does not, however, escape code\/code spaces (or handle special characters) in the path. So, as the other answer here mentions, you need to place the path in quotes ( code"/code or code'/code ) in order for those spaces (or special characters) to be interpreted literally. You accomplish this by using codequoted form of/code. Here it is:  precodequoted form of the POSIX path of the input -- gives a path like: '/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple Scripts/' /code/pre  <answer4941> Use codequoted form of the POSIX path of input/code.  Without the codequoted form of/code part, it won't handle funny characters (like spaces) in filenames correctly.  See this Apple technote.  <comment4992> The `/` at the beginning of the path is the boot volume. Other hard drives are under `/Volumes/`
