How can I upgrade my MySQL 5.1 to MySQL 5.6, and migrate data <body> I previously installed MySQL 5.1 using the installer, since then created a number of users/databases, and now would like to upgrade to 5.6. What is the procedure to do so?  <answer89675> The following assume your MySQL 5.1 is installed in code/usr/local/mysql-5.1.46-osx10.6-x86_64/code and that MySQL 5.6 will install in code/usr/local/mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64/code. The exact directory names might differ depending on the exact version number you are using.  ul liDownload the MySQL 5.6 installer, for instance in DMG format, and run codemysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64.pkg/code/li liStop the server ul liWith MySQL Workbench, go to emServer Administration/em/li liopen mysql@localhost (add connection if not there)/li liunder emStartup / Shupdown/em, click emStop Server/em/li /ul/li liCreate backup of 5.6 data directory: codesudo mv /usr/local/mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64/data /usr/local/mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64/data.save/code/li liCopy data directory from 5.1:  codesudo cp -a /usr/local/mysql-5.1.46-osx10.6-x86_64/data /usr/local/mysql-5.6.11-osx10.7-x86_64//code/li liStart server (similar to stopping, see above)/li liRun codemysql_upgrade/code, which checks all the tables and upgrades system tables/li liCheck data there, with MySQL Workbench ul liIn emServer Administration/em, under Users and Privileges, check the expected users are present/li liIn emSQL Development/em, open a connection to the database, and run a few queries to check the expected data is present./li /ul/li liIn MySQL Workbench, if getting "Error deleting password entry error when connecting with MySQL Workbench", upgrade to the latest version of MySQL Workbench/li /ul  <comment120266> Just a comment. If you've set up a password on the mysql 'root' account you may need to issue the command:  `mysql_upgrade -u root -p`  and enter the password when prompted. Instead of just `mysql_upgrade`
