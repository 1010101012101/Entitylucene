Trackpad 1 pair with windows 10 <body> I'm using windows 10 on my MBP, and my trackpad (Bluetooth) won't work, unless I disable the bluetooth, then it works... So, how can I have both trackpad and bluetooth?  <answer223178> So, I solved it by going back to OSX, removed the trackpad from the Bluetooth settings, then disabled bluetooth. I paired the trackpad with a tablet to test, and it paired, so I logged back to windows 10, then it paired with the '0000' code.  Strange, but it worked.  <comment270565> If your trackpad's problems persist, ckeck if you have installed the correct Boot Camp drivers that Apple provides for support of Apple trackpads, mice keyboards, etc.
