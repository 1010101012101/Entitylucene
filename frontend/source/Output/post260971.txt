How to block power from going to usb without stopping data transfer <body> I need an iPad connected to my iMac, but I don't want power going to it, because if you leave an iPad charged to 100% and don't let the battery go down, that ruins the life of the battery. I still want to be able to transfer data though(ex. syncing). My goal is to have the same data transfer, but with no charge(or extremely little) going to my device.  <answer260974> There is no easy way to do this. You could emtry/em to rewire a USB cable with the power wire removed. There's a chance this would work, but I wouldn't bet on it, it would depend on how the iPad handles USB connections.   You won't ruin your battery by having it plugged in at 100%. This might be an issue if you're leaving it 24 hours a day, but Apple is smart enough not to let their batteries die from being plugged in.  <comment326739> New Apple products won't overcharge. They'll charge to 100% then drop to 97% or so then back up and will continue repeating this cycle to avoid damaging the battery.

It almost certainly won't work with an iPad. http://www.computeraudiophile.com/f8-general-forum/universal-serial-bus-industry-standard-cables-connectors-and-communications-protocols-between-computers-and-electronic-devices-cable-no-vcc-and-ground-16299/
