How do I restore files accidentally deleted by the move operation in finder? <body> I’m using Mavericks  Suppose we have the folder /a/photos which contains  precode/a/photos/jan /a/photos/feb /code/pre  And we have /b/photos which contains  precode/b/photos/mar /code/pre  In the command prompt, if we write  precodemv /b/photos /a/photos /code/pre  Then /a/photos will contain all of them (merge):  precode/a/photos/jan /a/photos/feb /a/photos/mar /code/pre  However, I did the move operation in Finder (command+c, command+alt+v) and pressed the “overwrite” button thinking it has the same behavior as in mv  Now all my original files in /a/photos are lost. The only thing remaining is:  precode/a/photos/mar /code/pre  How do I recover it?  Thanks a lot  <answer136865> strongSTOP ALL FILE OPERATIONS AND UNMOUNT YOUR HARD DRIVE/strong  If you haven't written to the Drive since then, it will eventually save you.  When Moving files like this, they get marked as deleted on the drive.br/ Therefore you can only try to recover them.  Which means:   ul liGet a Recovery-Software like DataRescue/li liOr a free (CLI) programm like PhotoRec/li liTry recovering the files./li /ul  <comment162472> Do you have a recent backup? <comment162473> @patrix No. The files are in an external USB hard disk and I don't use time machine or stuffs like that.
