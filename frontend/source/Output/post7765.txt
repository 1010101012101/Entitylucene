How can I combine multiple screenshots in Skitch? <body> With Skitch, I often find myself wanting to take screenshots of different parts of the screen, annotating them, and combining them into one image. I could use a separate program for this last step, such as Acorn, but is it possible to do this from within Skitch?  <answer7767> Nope, not possible within Skitch.   The quickest workaround I've found to achieve that is using Keynote as a canvas, so you can combine the image in no time :   ul liopen a new 'White' theme in Keynote/li lidrag &amp; drop the 2 images from Skitch to Keynote/li lialign the images in Keynote, resize, do some edits if necessary/li litake a snapshot with Skitch/li /ul  <answer70208> Can't do it with Skitch, as noted. But LittleSnapper will work. It creates an image for each screen, then you can drop them all into a photo imaging app and compose into one image.   <comment8481> Great tip, thank you!
