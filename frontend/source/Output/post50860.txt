How do I take a screenshot without the shadow behind it? <body> If I take a screenshot with kbdShift ⇧/kbd + kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd4/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd, then I get one of the two images:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wzkHS.png" alt="blue-with-focus"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rq7ol.png" alt="blue-wo-focus"    Either way the saved image is surrounded by the shadow halo. I could then edit it out by hand (using Preview) to discard the shadow, or I could use kbdShift ⇧/kbd + kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd4/kbd and try to pinpoint the boundary by hand, but neither lets me get a pixel-perfect boundary easily.  Is there a convenient way to save a window without its shadow?  <answer50862> You can disable the shadow added when capturing an entire window by executing the following command from the Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool TRUE /code/pre  You'll need to reboot or restart the UIServer for the changes to take effect:  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  You can undo this preference and re-enable shadows by executing the following:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool FALSE; killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <answer50863> Another option is to use codescreencapture/code:  precodescreencapture -oic /code/pre  code-o/code disables shadows, code-i/code captures an area, and code-c/code copies the image to the clipboard.  This would use a timer of 5 seconds and save the image to a file:  precodescreencapture -oi -T5 /tmp/screencapture.png /code/pre  Run codescreencapture -h/code to list all options:  precode$ screencapture -h screencapture: illegal option -- h usage: screencapture [-icMPmwsWxSCUtoa] [files]   -c         force screen capture to go to the clipboard   -C         capture the cursor as well as the screen. only in non-interactive modes   -d         display errors to the user graphically   -i         capture screen interactively, by selection or window                control key - causes screen shot to go to clipboard                space key   - toggle between mouse selection and                              window selection modes                escape key  - cancels interactive screen shot   -m         only capture the main monitor, undefined if -i is set   -M         screen capture output will go to a new Mail message   -o         in window capture mode, do not capture the shadow of the window   -P         screen capture output will open in Preview   -s         only allow mouse selection mode   -S         in window capture mode, capture the screen not the window   -t&lt;format&gt; image format to create, default is png (other options include pdf, jpg, tiff and other formats)   -T&lt;seconds&gt; Take the picture after a delay of &lt;seconds&gt;, default is 5   -w         only allow window selection mode   -W         start interaction in window selection mode   -x         do not play sounds   -a         do not include windows attached to selected windows   -r         do not add dpi meta data to image   -l&lt;windowid&gt; capture this windowsid   -R&lt;x,y,w,h&gt; capture screen rect   files   where to save the screen capture, 1 file per screen /code/pre  You can also use toggle-osx-shadows to disable shadows everywhere in OS X:  codegit clone https://github.com/pufuwozu/toggle-osx-shadows.git;cd toggle-osx-shadows;make;mv toggle-osx-shadows /usr/local/bin;toggle-osx-shadows/code  <answer52688> Another useful option is to use TinkerTool. Go to TinkerTool and under the General tab, you'll find an option to disable shadows emonly/em when taking screenshots (along with several other related options):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BcnRF.jpg" alt=""  <answer120017> I know this is an old question - but I can never find this information when searching for it (just the information in the accepted answer to turn it off globally), and end up just trying random keys each time.  If you hold Option while clicking (after doing the Cmd-Shift-4, Space dance), the saved screenshot will not have the drop shadow.  I'm unsure if this only applies to Mountain Lion and later.  <answer223465> Just use kbdShift ⇧/kbd + kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd4/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd, and hold down kbdoption/kbd when you click to select the window.  <comment58259> also very useful when one wants to capture from a script. <comment139979> Works in Mavericks. That's awesome! <comment148129> Works in 10.8.5. Very convenient. <comment157681> Superb - easiest answer by far! <comment168577> Quick solution as posted by @[asherkin](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/69605/asherkin) [below](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/120017/14994): Hold the Option key while clicking (after doing the Cmd-Shift-4, Space dance) and the saved screenshot will not have the drop shadow ! <comment200529> Technically, a fresh install of OSX doesn't have that default at all. Running `defaults read com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow` gives you `The domain/default pair of (com.apple.screencapture, disable-shadow) does not exist`. Therefore the more accurate way to undo the change is with `defaults delete com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow`. <comment278257> Works in El Capitan as well! <comment301857> This is the real answer. @Calaf you should changed your choice if possible. <comment311974> Brilliant!  Thx! <comment327163> Be sure to check out the better answer! http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/120017/41827 <comment343996> Works in macOS Sierra too. <comment355704> Why did nobody see this before?
