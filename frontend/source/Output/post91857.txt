Missing File in Download stack <body> I have a file that shows up in my 'Downloads' stack with the filename nMEMp5Qv.exe.part.  However, when I open Finder, the file is not in the Downloads folder.  Also, I can't delete the file from the Stack as you normally can...?  Any ideas/thoughts?  <answer91862> h11 . Delete the stack from your dock and drag the download folder again into the dock and try/h1  Download stack ? Check you download history -   precodesqlite3 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV* 'select LSQuarantineDataURLString from LSQuarantineEvent' /code/pre  <comment107898> Is it shown by `ls -a ~/Downloads/`? Have you already tried logging out and back in? A similar issue where deleted files are shown on the desktop is fixed by just reopening Finder.
