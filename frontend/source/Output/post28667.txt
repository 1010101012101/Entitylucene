Is Mac OS X required to submit an app to the iOS App Store? <body> We are about to develop an application using Phonegap, a cross platform mobile development tool, but they offer a service where they will build your applications and send you the compiled source code.   Can I submit the compiled source code to the App Store on a Windows-based PC?  <answer28672> No, the compiled code must be submitted via a Mac. One "workaround" is to install OS X into a virtual machine on Windows, but that violates the OS X user agreement. So yes, you'll need a Mac.  <comment32964> Theoretically, could Phonegap also offer the service of submitting for you? <comment32966> There's a great answer on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6870020/distributing-a-third-party-developed-application-via-app-store/6870341#6870341). In short, not really. It may work for individual developers, but not with one company (Phonegap) submitting multiple apps from different companies. <comment32971> Thanks! I just wanted to make sure we HAD to buy some macbooks. I didn't want to lie to upper management. I can't wait to get them! <comment32979> HA! Nice. Enjoy the new shiny.
