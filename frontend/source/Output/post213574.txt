How do I get the Finder sidebar like it used to be? <body> I upgraded to El Capitan. In the Finder sidebar at the bottom, there used to be a link to the Photos app. It's gone now. Does anyone know how to get it back?  <comment257832> I'm not running OS X 10.11.x however in OS X 10.10.x selecting the Photos application bundle in **Finder** and pressing **⌃⌘T** (Control-Command-T) or selecting **Add to Sidebar** from the **File** _menu_ in **Finder** would do the trick.  Are you saying that does not work in OS X 10.11 El Capitan? <comment257835> Are your referring to the Dock?  "The Finder sidebar at the bottom"  Do you have a screenshot you can post? <comment258015> Sometimes it shows up in the Finder window, and sometimes it doesn't.   http://imgur.com/LZwO2mu
