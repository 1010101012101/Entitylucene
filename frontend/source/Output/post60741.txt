How can I kill a process using top on OS X? <body> On other Unixe,s I can use codetop/code and then hit kbdK/kbd and type the process ID.  How can I do that in OS X?  I can type codekill [the_pid]/code on its own at the command line and that works. However, I was wondering if there was a way for it to happen while in the codetop/code program.  <answer60743> From the codetop/code man page:   precode  S&lt;signal&gt;&lt;pid&gt;           Send  &lt;sig&gt;  to  &lt;pid&gt;.   &lt;sig&gt; can be specified either as a number or           as a name (for example, HUP).  The default signal starts out as TERM.           Each time a signal is  successfully  sent,  the default signal is updated           to be that signal.  &lt;pid&gt; is a process id. /code/pre   <answer60761> precode# top /code/pre  press kbdshift/kbd + kbds/kbd. This will bring up:  precodesignal [TERM]: /code/pre  At this point you can just press return for a 'polite' process end request ("signal 15") that will let the process clean up files, release memory, etc. For process that can't be killed this way, you can enter the word ‘kill’ which is signal "9" then press kbdreturn/kbd.   Now top prompts for a pid (process id):  precodepid: /code/pre  Enter the pid of the process you want to kill and that should take care of it.  <comment70001> if you're on other *NIXes, you've probably already used `htop`.  I find it to be more informative and consistent from machine to machine. It's available via MacPorts. <comment70301> I wouldn't use SIGKILL as the first choice. The suggested SIGTERM should do for most processes.  SIGKILL terminates a process without any recourse or clean-up, possibly leaving a "zombie" process that still has open file descriptors, allocated memory, etc. <comment71671> Thanks Jan. However I see no mention of SIGKILL in this answer.  Presumably implied?  Also if SIGTERM is a better option please state exactly what to type. <comment72191> ok, I'll just update it myself.
