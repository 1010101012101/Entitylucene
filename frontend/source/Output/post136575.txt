Calendar show more all-day events <body> Is it possible to increase the area dedicated to all-day events? It grows automatically up to 5 events, the 6th is partially shown and from the 7th they are hidden.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HmGO7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer136622> To see multiple (5) "all day" events in a single day, you need to use the View by Day option.  Or alternatively you can use the week view but with scroll function.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zs9MW.jpg" alt="day"  <comment162157> I can scroll the events, what I would like to achieve is to always show them. <comment162160> can you be specific, how many do you want to see, unlimited?, what about loosing the window space below? <comment162162> 5 seems an arbitrary number. Unlimited would clearly be a problem, ideally the separator line should be moveable but since it is not possible a higher limit (e.g., 10) would be OK <comment162163> see my updated answer
