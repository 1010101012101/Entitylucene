Vector dot product and scalar multiplication in Grapher.app <body> I'm trying to play around with vectors in Grapher.app, but I'm getting an error when I try to A: multiply two vectors (specified as a vertical matrix) together, and B: multiply a vector by a scalar value. Here's my dilemma in picture form: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlf4c.png" alt="vector math in grapher"  Any ideas?  <answer51068> If you want to multiply two column vectors don't you have to transpose one of them? I got the transpose operator by typing code^T/code. (That's caret + T, not Ctrl+T)  I was able to multiply a vector by a scalar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gutIJ.png" alt="vector operations"  In your screenshot, the subscripts aren't consistent. Maybe it's part of your problem or maybe it's just some math I don't understand. This is all on the edge of my math knowledge.  h1Epilogue/h1  For those who are interested, here is bjz's screenshot of his working version:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XOCvY.png" alt="working version"   <comment58391> Cheers mate, I [got it to work](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sDP7B.png). And yes, my maths knowledge isn't great â€“ I'm just using Grapher to sketch out my algorithms before I commit to code.
