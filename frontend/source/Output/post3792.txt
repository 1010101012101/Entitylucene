Web sharing, 404 <body> On my MacBook (10.5.latest), I turned on "Web sharing" in the control panel.  The built-in firewall is turned off.  I have an index.html in my ~/name/Sites/ folder.  It's publicly readable (a+r).  I can view it in Safari (or any other browser) if I open it as a file.  If I go to http://192.168.15.103/~name/index.html (or without index.html, or with any other file from that folder), I get a page which says simply:     404 - Not Found   What am I missing?  And how do I go about troubleshooting this -- where are the logs?  <answer3794> For some reason Apple disabled personal web sharing from your ~/username/Sites folder in Mac OS X 10.5. To turn it back on, edit strongcode/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code/strong and look for the following:  precode# # Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect # to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that # directory (and its subdirectories). # # First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of # features. # &lt;Directory /&gt;     Options FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride All     Order deny,allow     Deny from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  Change strongcodeDeny from all/code/strong to strongcodeAllow from all/code/strong. Then go into your Sharing preferences and disable/re-enable web sharing and it should work.  <answer44236> Although I'm not sure if the origins of the problem were same, I faced the exact scenario as you described, and I made the "Your personal website:http://192.168.0.100/~name/" provided in System Preferences panel work by uninstalling Pow, a Rack server.  <comment3578> Found it, changed it, restarted it, still get the 404.  :-(  I was going to be shocked if this was the case, since the control panel says "Your personal website: http://192.168.15.103/~name/". <comment3579> Also, I'm pretty sure I've used personal web sharing on 10.5 here before, and /private/var/log/apache2/access_log shows a few successful (200) hits to files under ~/name/ in 2008. <comment3580> @Ken Are you using your full username? The "/~username/" in the URL is your "short" username. If that's not it I'm not sure what's wrong. <comment3581> could it be a permissions error?  I think it's a different error code for permissions errors but make your index.html permissions are at least 644 <comment3582> It's the 'short' name (Unix login name, same as the control panel says to use, same as the access logs said I used in 2008).  My index.html is already 644 (that's rw/r/r, IIRC). <comment3588> try 777 just as a test. if works you know it was permissions.  not likely, but worth a try :) <comment3601> calavera: OK, tried it.  Even making index.html executable doesn't help it be served as a webpage.  :-) <comment3625> lol, i know crap about web serving so it was a shot in the dark :P <comment3626> can you get to the computer's apache page by going to just the ip address without a user name? <comment3652> calavera: Any path I try (including nothing at all) gives the same 404.  But if I try, say, the same IP address on a different port, then Safari gives a very different can't-connect error, so it looks like the 404 is indeed coming from my web server (in case that was in doubt). <comment3653> @Ken did you check the permissions of the containing folder (~/username/Sites)? I've occasionally had problems where the permissions on the file were OK but the containing folder were affecting my ability to access the page <comment4615> Are you using FileVault? <comment4622> ickket no, I'm not <comment50267> The logs are in `/var/log` or `/var/log/apache2`, access_log and error_log are of interest.
