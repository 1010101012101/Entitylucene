Is there an app for the iPhone 4 that tells the pitch of a note through an audio input? <body> Does anyone know of an app for the iPhone that can analyze sounds and tell us what pitch the sound is?  For example, if i had that app running and i go to the piano and play some notes, it should be able to tell me what notes they are.  <answer22896> Garageband can do this. Open a new (or existing) project and add a new "real" track with no effects. On the bottom edge of the window you´ll see a LCD-like window which usually displays the current time or measure in the track; depending on which version of Garageband you´re using, you can now either use the up-/down-arrows to switch to the tuner (tuning fork symbol) or click on the tuning fork symbol directly to select the tuner. Every sound that is picked up by your Mac´s microphone will now be displayed as note (with off-pitch)  <answer22911> Identifying a single pitch is one thing. Any "tuner" or "guitar tuner" app can do that, as well as any dedicated hardware tuner.   However, analyzing the notes in a emchord/em, or transcribing a musical passage from an audio source emin real time/em, is not something that any existing program can do on any computer platform.   There is a Windows and Macintosh program for electronic music composition and audio recording and editing called Melodyne that can analyze the individual notes in a chord from something that's been recorded, and then let you edit those notes independently.  <comment25561> An app for what platform? iPhone, Macintosh, Windows? Do you have an audio interface and a microphone to use with your computing platform? <comment25593> @Wheat i-phone 4 <comment25601> Why didn't you say so in the first place? <comment61297> Are you aware if there is a "free" app that evaluates the pitch of a *sound*?
