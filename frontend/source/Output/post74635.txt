Changing WiFi settings separately <body> I'm using 2 WiFi networks with my MacBook Air. I need to switch between them sometimes. The problem is one needs completely different settings from the other, and it looks like I can only make settings for the particular WiFi network I am connected to at that moment.  Is there a way to set them separaely for specified network?  <answer74659> You can create different environments for your network (System preferences -- Network) and apply different settings to these environments.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pEtjB.jpg" alt="Create your environments"  If you now switch your WiFi you can also easily change the environment (unfortunately it is not possible to do this automatically - at least not with standard tools), by clicking onto the Apple logo in the menu bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k04Bi.jpg" alt=""  (Sorry my OS X installation is in german language)
