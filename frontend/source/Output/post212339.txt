White bar over menu bar? <body> I'm experiencing this weird bug on OS X El capitan.  There is a white bar over most of my menu items in the top right of my screen. The items are still there and are interactable.  Anyone got any ideas? A quick google search didn't seem to give me any ideas for it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KRv5z.png" alt="image 1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fCsGS.png" alt="image 2"  <answer212370> In SystemPreferences-Display  set the Brightness lower.  <answer252672> For me this happened on one of the monitors that I was extending my macbook pro's desktop to, not all of them though.  Easiest fix, expand a program to full screen and then minimize it again, somehow the animation of expanding fixes it.  <comment367045> This workaround works. Although I wonder what the cause is, and how to prevent it. Do you guys also use the Bartender app, by any chance? (it hides some icons from the Tray bar)
