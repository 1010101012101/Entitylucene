Black sun animation in iTunes. Does anyone know what it is? <body> I got this black sun animation inside my iTunes.  It was triggered by some shortcut, but I can't remember which one.  Does anyone know what it is?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBGXD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer234491> That is the codeVisualizer/code.  You can press Command + T (Ctrl + T on Windows) to start it.  Or it is available form the View Menu.  precodeView --&gt; Show Visualizer /code/pre  Also in the View Menu you can change some of the settings for the way the codeVisualizer/code looks.  precodeView --&gt; Visualizer --&gt; &lt;More Options Here&gt; /code/pre  <comment286977> I thought it's virus before. Thanks a lot.
