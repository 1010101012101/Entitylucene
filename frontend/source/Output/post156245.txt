Bose QuietComfort 20 not working after Yosemite upgrade <body> I have a mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina, and am using QuietComfort20 headphones that previously used to work.  Now, after a clean install of OS X Yosemite, I'm unable to use the headphones, no audio comes through them at all.  When I adjust the volume use F11 or F12 I get the following   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hDq0N.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer156278> Seems that the Audio Output selector was "Parallels Access Audio".  When I used parallels access apparently the default output was changed, and not reverted.   <comment183756> does it show the headset in System Preferences Sound output?
