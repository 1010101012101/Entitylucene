How to create an ISO from a file (not a directory) <body> I'm trying to perform some testing on old platforms. In this case, its Fedora 1 (circa 2002 or 2003). The VM software (VMware and VirtualBox) can't handle distros that old, so the guests don't have a network card.  I found I could transfer stuff to them through the CD Rom drive. However, when I attempt to build an ISO with a file I am trying to transfer:  precodehdiutil makehybrid -o ~/image.iso ~/make-4.1.tar.gz -iso -joliet Creating hybrid image...  hdiutil: makehybrid failed - Operation not permitted /code/pre  I also tried with codecreate/code, but that result in an error, too:  precodehdiutil create -ov ~/make-4.1.tar.gz  -iso -joliet hdiutil: create: unknown option "-iso" Usage:  hdiutil create &lt;sizespec&gt; [options] &lt;imagepath&gt;     hdiutil create -help /code/pre  I've also tried with and without the option strongemcodemakehybrid/code/em/strong.  How do I create an ISO of a file (and not a directory)?  hr  I want to avoid unzipping and then building the ISO because filenames and permissions are changed (This is older software that's not as stable as it is today).  <answer215375> You can't create an ISO image from a non-image file. emhdiutil/em and especially emhdiutil makehybrid/em expect an image or a directory (not necessarily containing files!).  hr  But you don't have to unzip/unarchive anything. Just create a folder with the name emMAKE/em, move the gz file into it and then enter codehdiutil makehybrid -o ~/make.iso ~/MAKE -iso -joliet/code. The resulting mounted image just contains the file emmake-4.1.tar.gz/em.  The permissions of the iso mounted to the file system of the Fedora VM should then be:   precode# ls -al /dev/cdrom* lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 [date] /dev/cdrom -&gt; devicename #e.g. sr0 or something similar, it depends on your distro and the /etc/fstab file inside the VM /code/pre  and the file emmake-4.1.tar.gz/em "inside" is world readable.  After copying the gz file to your user folder in the VM, unarchive/unzip it.  <answer216141> To reduce Klanomath's answer to a recipe:  precodemkdir -p /tmp/MAKE rm -f ./make.iso cp make-4.1.tar.gz /tmp/MAKE/make-4.1.tar.gz hdiutil makehybrid -o ./make.iso /tmp/MAKE/ -iso -joliet /code/pre  Then, mount codemake.iso/code in the virtual machine.  Be aware of the race conditions when using code/tmp/code. They are not a worry to me because this is for local testing, and not production.  <comment260110> Did you try wrapping your command with `sudo`? It may be that `hdiutil` is trying to write temp-files to a place were it does not have access. <comment260151> The source for hdiutil -makehybrid needs to be a directory or disk image (see manpage); maybe try extracting the archive with -p option passed to tar to preserve permissions/owners.
