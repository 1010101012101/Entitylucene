Is there a car-friendly way to play music on the iPhone without a car kit? <body> I'm wondering if there is a car-friendly way to play music on the iPhone without any type of car kit.  Specifically, I am looking for a way to change tracks without unlocking the phone.  I'm okay with pressing the home button, I just don't want to worry about unlocking the phone.    Some examples would be:br 1) Swipe controls accessible from the lockscreen.br 2) Shaking/moving the iPhone in a certain way.    I know Siri can do this, but I was hoping there was a way to accomplish this pre-Siri.    The normal music player on the lockscreen is not suitable for driving, as I have to look at the phone to press the touchscreen in the right place.    <answer75174> You could get something like this remote, which has passthrough for any standard 3.5mm audio, and provides volume controls and a clicker remote (just like on Apple's headphones). The clicker can to play, pause, and skip (double click for forward, triple click for backward).  There are other similar products out there, I found a few by searching for "iPhone inline remote".  <comment87287> Disable locking while in the car? <comment87292> @Thorbj√∏rnRavnAndersen, not that familiar with iOS.  Can you disable lockscreen? Can you swipe w/ normal music player? <comment87315> To disable lockscreen: Settings/General/AutoLock/Never <comment87355> It appears that this is a very cheap device (giving a lot of bad reviews).  Perhaps there is a more expensive but better version of this? <comment87378> I didn't really look at the reviews, but you're probably right. As I noted, there are other similar products out there, I just picked the first one I found as a representative sample. Actual shopping is left to the reader.
