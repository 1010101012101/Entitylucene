How to enable "Show message on Lock Screen" with Script <body> So, In Mavericks, you can set text to be displayed on the lock screen by checking the box: System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General  "Show a message when the screen is locked", then clicking "Set Lock Message..." and entering the desired text.   My problem: I want to do this to dozens of Macs by sending them a script.   Now, I found that I can set the text to be displayed with this command:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow \          LoginwindowText 'Enter desired text here' /code/pre  But, I cannot figure out how to check that "Show a message..." checkbox via either a script, an MCX setting, or a Profile.   Any ideas?  <answer149135> I'm an idiot! Just having the "LoginwindowText" key set to a string value is all you need!  My "problem" was two-fold:  ol liThe GUI won't display the checkbox as "checked" until you log out and back in./li liI had a typo in the key name in some of my notes that I was copy-pasting from./li /ol  Hope this helps somebody else... I spent some serious time banging my head against a wall!
