Where can I find the log of all mounted volumes? <body> To be more specific, I mean the file that keeps a history of every disk image/volume ever mounted. I know it exists because I found it once, but it was a long time ago and I have no idea how to find it again. It is similar to the InstallHistory.plist file, which logs every program ever installed.  <answer140904> You can find the information in code/var/log/system.log/code (or using the Console application). But the information is not kept forever.  For example:  precodeAug  4 07:34:34 ******** kernel[0]: hfs: mounted External on device disk3 Aug  4 07:34:44 ******** kernel[0]: hfs: mounted Time Machine on device disk5 /code/pre  and and a DMG  precodeAug  5 07:53:25 ******** kernel[0]: hfs: mounted Xcode on device disk6s2 /code/pre  After a while codesystem.log/code is compressed and archived. To search in all the stored logs  precodecd /var/log/ for file in system.log* ; do gzcat $file | grep mounted ; done /code/pre  <comment166034> I feel like it was specifically a list of DMGs that had been mounted, not external volumes. <comment166037> In my system log I also find external volumes <comment166095> Me too, that's why I don't think that's the list I remember. I remember it showing just the DMG files that had been opened and mounted. Maybe some sort of Disk Image Mounter log or something.
