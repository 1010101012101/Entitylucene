iTunes can't download song purchased from old computer, on to new computer <body> I bought and downloaded a song in iTunes on a PC of mine. I never synced it to my iPhone. Well, I got a new computer, and no long have the old one. I think there might be a problem now.  Here is what happens when I click strongCheck For Available Downloads/strong in iTunes: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7p04h.png" alt="All purchases have been downloaded for this account."  And here is what happens when I click on buy, for the song in the iTunes Store: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcgXF.png" alt="You have purchased this item before."  Is this a case of a badly worded dialog? I've seen something like this before in the App Store when I needed to reinstall a paid app. In that case I "bought" the app again, the second time without being charged.  <answer25388> In iTunes 10.3.3 or later, select strongEdit/strong, strongPreferences/strong, strongStore/strong.  Under strongAutomatic Downloads/strong you can select which categories to automatically download.  If strongMusic/strong isn't an option, then you'll have to transfer your library manually.  I suspect strongMusic/strong is only an option in the US.  See iTues Store Support for more information.  <answer25390> Unfortunately this is the expected behaviour. Re-download of music is not supported. You have a only a few options:  ul liWait for iCloud to become available for Japan. Currently emAutomatic Downloads/em for Music is only available in the US. Once it is eneblaed internationally you can enable it as Hand-E-Food described in his answer./li liE-Mail Apple support and tell them you lost the music due to an hardware-crash or something similar. There are reports that Apple support allows re-downloads of your complete purchase history. But this is a one time offer and a courtesy of Apple./li /ul  <comment28685> What country are you in and which iTunes store do you buy from?  In some countries (such as Australia) music cannot be re-downloaded.  Only apps and books can be re-downloaded. <comment28704> This is happening in the Japanese store. <comment28712> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. Wow, besides specifically saying that you can download previously purchased music, reading on into the footnotes, it says it's only supported in the US. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2519?viewlocale=ja_JP#1 <comment28738> Getting support went well. My "personal" rep added the song to my account, and upon checking for available downloads again, there it was.
