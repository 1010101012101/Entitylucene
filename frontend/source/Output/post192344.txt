Accessibility Menu items no longer selectable under OS X Yosemite? <body> If I'm not mistaken, in earlier editions of OS X, the menu items pictured below could be selected to turn them on or off.   Apparently, that's changed in Yosemite. Is there a way to turn on each accessibility feature from the contextual menu rather than selecting "Accessibility Preferences" to turn them on and off in System Preferences?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1m5fy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer192364> In Yosemite     To easily check which accessibility features are on, select the option   at the bottom of Accessibility preferences to show the accessibility   status in the menu bar.      To quickly turn on common accessibility features without opening   System Preferences, press kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdF5/kbd. To hear the names of the   options spoken in turn, press Tab. To set more accessibility options,   click Preferences.   kb/PH18398  If it is not showing up in your menu bar, use Disk Utility and restore permissions.  <answer192391> The menubar item in Yosemite no longer allows you to make direct changes to the settings, it is merely an advisory list of what is on and off.  You can make changes to the settings in the list below, previously accessible from the menubar, by pressing kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdF5/kbd and ticking the appropriate boxes (see screenshot). The remaining settings, and others, can be set in System Preferences.  ul liInvert screen colors/li liMouse keys/li liSticky keys/li liSlow keys/li liVoiceOver/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OvIA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer202880> First of all do option command f5 and press keyboard shortcuts,then select accessibility and tick inverted colors, now whenever you want to have inverted screen just do ctrl option command 8  Hope this helps ya!  <comment228759> Is it enabled in the syst pref Accessibility, Show accessibility status in Menu bar? <comment228817> @Buscarì›ƒSD I think OP's point is that the options in the menu are all greyed out, whereas in prior versions you could click on them to change their status. Literally all the menu bar option does anymore is show you the status - you still have to open System Preferences from there to make changes. <comment229163> @tubedogg is right. Using a contextual menu to display what features are turned on rather than a feature toggle is downright bizarre from a UI perspective.
