iMessage is not functioning properly <body> I just updated to iOS9 and all hell broke loose on iMessage-every now and then, messages that I receive would pop up on the screen for a second and then disappear! I have tried restarting iMessage multiple times but the issue seems to persist. And this has been occurring only since the update. What must I do to rectify this situation?   <answer208146> As one potential route to take, IPSWs (firmware files) for iOS 8.4.1 are still being signed as of the time of this posting (according to ipsw.me).
