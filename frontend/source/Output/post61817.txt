Delete all OS X accounts in terminal when selling laptop <body> I have an old macbook with some photos on it that I'm trying to sell. I want to keep the OS on there so that someone new can use it, but I have to wipe it through terminal because the screen is mostly broken.  How can I delete all accounts on my Mac and leave it with a fresh install with no DVD and a mostly broken screen?  Note: I don't have a video out adapter. I know that would be the easy option, but I'm a sucker for the Terminal.  Update: I used this article http://en.kioskea.net/forum/affich-73393-change-mac-admin-password-without-the-disk  It gives me a new account and the computer starts up as if I just walked out of the store with it, but it says that the other account still exists.  <answer61822> h2Command Line Only/h2  It looks like there are a four things that need to be deleted:  ol lithe user's home directory/li lithe user's membership in groups/li liuser's primary group/li lithe user's actual account along with their password hash/li /ol  The University of Utah Mac Managers group submitted a scrip to CodeSnippets to handle this.

Also, updated my question. <comment71406> Sadly, I have to answer no to all of those questions. <comment71414> @EGHDK I've revised my answer to include a command line only solution. <comment71416> Awesome. Will try this out in a little bit. Thanks
