Stop audio alerts for other people's calendars <body> I use Outlook 2013's calendar and yesterday added iCloud syncing to Outlook. At that point, I saw a plethora of choices for calendars to check. I narrowed it down to three calendars (family members) plus mine. But now I'm getting an audio reminder for events on other people's calendars. I only want to hear sounds for my calendar. I went on my iPhone 4s to Go to Settings; Mail, Contacts, Calendars; under Shared Calendar Alerts, swipe to Off. But I'm still getting their alert sounds--the last one came in at midnight--what fun! Any suggestions to hear sounds for only my calendar?  <comment175117> Your iPhone 4s is on what iOS ?
