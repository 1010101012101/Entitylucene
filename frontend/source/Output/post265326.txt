Headphone icon on display of iphone <body> Why is there a headphone icon next to the battery % on my iPhone display and how do I remove it ?

Will update my answer.  <answer265352> I plugged the headphones in and unplugged them several times and it worked! Icon disappeared.  <answer265363> Apparently this is the new Bluetooth icon on the iPhone  <answer265370> It's the Bluetooth indicator.

When any wireless Bluetooth headphones are connected to the device, they will show up in the form of a headphone icon in the status bar.  <comment332682> It's really helpful if you include the model of your iPhone, which version of iOS you are running and even a screen capture.  Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder. <comment332692> Don't think the headphone icon was _only_ used for W1 devices before... my cheapo Bluetooth running headphones have always shown up here. <comment333197> How does this differ or improve on older answers?
