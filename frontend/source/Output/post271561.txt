Which `vboxmanage clonehd` variant corresponds to the GUI selection `dynamically allocated`? <body> I wanted to resize a VMDK, which codeVBoxManage/code can't resize directly, so I used the Convert to VDI → Resize VDI → Convert to VMDK procedure described here.  For the last step, I could not find clear documentation of which code--variant/code corresponded to the "dynamically allocated" option I chose in the GUI when creating the original VMDK.  The documentation on codeclonehd/code has this list of variants: Standard, Fixed, Split2G, Stream, ESX.  It is not obvious from the names which of those is dynamically allocated, and there is no mention of which variants apply to which image formats.  The documentation on disk image files refers to the GUI options of "fixed-size" or "dynamically allocated", but uses the word "variant" to mean file format, and does not refer to the list above or any of its entries.  strongWhich code--variant/code corresponds to selecting "dynamically allocated" in the GUI?/strong  This is with VirtualBox 5.0.32 r112930 on macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (16D32)  <answer271563> According to this forum post:  ul liStandard (the default) - one piece dynamic (sparse) extent file, plus a small descriptor file./li liFixed - extents will be flat (rather than dynamic/sparse)./li liSplit2G - image is split into multiple extents, each less than 2GB./li liStream - image is optimized for streaming downloads rather than running in a VM.

But where the heck did they find that information?
