Open specific links in specific browsers <body> Is it possible to tell OS X to always open one site in Chrome, and always open another site in Safari?  In a nutshell, I want to set a default browser per domain rather than globally for the entire computer.  Here's why I ask:  Out of the box OS X does not come with Flash.  The Chrome browser has Flash bundled, however.  So I'd like to have domains that I know require Flash always open in Chrome, but everything else open in my preferred browser, which is Safari.  I'm okay with maintaining a "white list" of which sites need the "use chrome" exception, but right now I can't see any way to make it happen.  Any suggestions?  <answer234955> Try to use Choosy It can prompt you to select from the browsers on your Mac so you can decide which browser is right for a particular link.  :)
