Gmail app with automatic categories and without hyphens before signature <body> I use Gmail, but using it with the default apple mail app doesn't have push notifications which is annoying.  I've tried using the Gmail app, it works well but there's a downside. When you add a signature to your email, it automatically adds a '--' as well as puts it to the bottom of the email, like right down at the end instead of below the email you just wrote. This is annoying, as I have my signature set up a specific way to stop this, and this isn't an issue on Android.  I've tried other email applications, such as Outlook, but they don't sort the emails like the Gmail app does (Primary, Social and Promotions).  This is an issue as I don't want all the ads to be in my inbox and getting push notifications for them.  Does anyone use a Gmail app which is (free/paid)â€¦  ul listrongGood for sorting the mail into the folders, primary, social and promotions/strong/li listrongHas a signature setup which actually works properly./strong/li /ul
