Full-screen photos for incoming calls in iOS7.1 <body> I have upgraded my iPhone to iOS 7.1 What the hell happened to my full-screen photos for  incoming calls?  <answer124284> Apple changed the layout/design of the incoming-call and call-in-progress screen with iOS 7.1. If you want to let them know that you preferred the old layout, you can use the Apple Feedback form on apple.com.  <comment145304> What do you possibly expect anyone to answer to a "question" (using the term loosely) like this? <comment145318> Ehh yes, and we all have to know what it looks right now and how it looked before in the past? Maybe screenshots an option? Or at least more details?
