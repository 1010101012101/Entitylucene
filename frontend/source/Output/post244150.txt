-bash: /usr/bin/svn: No such file or directory <body> I am trying to upgrade my svn version. So I deleted older binary  precodesudo rm /usr/bin/svn /code/pre  Then I installed svn   precodebrew install svn /code/pre  And linked it too  precodeathakur:home athakur$ brew link --overwrite subversion Warning: Already linked: /usr/local/Cellar/subversion/1.9.4 To relink: brew unlink subversion &amp;&amp; brew link subversion /code/pre  But when I do svn --version it says  precodeathakur:home athakur$ svn -bash: /usr/bin/svn: No such file or directory /code/pre  Any idea how do I restore new svn binary?  <answer244160> Here are the SVN binary packages: https://subversion.apache.org/packages.html  I had previously faced a similar issue and this solved the issue for me.  Also, when I tried using brew I had an issue, so I used MacPorts.  <answer244163> Looks like homebrew installed svn in  precode/usr/local/Cellar/subversion/1.9.4 /code/pre  So I added it in $PATH  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/subversion/1.9.4/bin/ /code/pre  Added it in code~/.bash_profile/code. Then execute -   precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  and all seems good again  <comment300833> Well home-brew won't update or change anything in /usr/bin what directory does Homebrew documentation say it will be in? <comment300834> @Mark looks like it is in `/usr/local/Cellar/subversion/1.9.4/bin` <comment300836> See the related questions
