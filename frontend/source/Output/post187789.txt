Publishing app with iAd but no completed contract <body> Would it be possible to submit an app with iAd in it, without having your iAd contract completed? Since it would be like 7-14 days for Apple to review the app and publish it.  Could I submit my app now, and do the iAd contract tomorrow and everything will be fine?   <answer187798> No, the iAd contract must be up and running the moment your app is reviewed, otherwise your app will be rejected.  <answer187800> You can submit your app and use the waiting period to complete meta-data and surrounding materials.  strongTry submitting your app./strong If the app passes the automated checks, then you have a few days to sort out the contract.  As @jherran mentions, you will need the iAd contract completed before the app review takes place.
