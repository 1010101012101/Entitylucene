4 Ways to remove an IOS app: is there a preferred method? <body> Per this article, there are 4 methods to remove an app:  ul litap and wiggle/li lifrom settings /li lifrom iTunes/li liwhen updating/li /ul  Is there an advantage / preference to use one of these methods over another?  <answer255569> Nope, no advantages between them.
