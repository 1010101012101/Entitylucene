Can't use keyboard shortcuts to switch spaces unless I'm in mission control <body> I have my Mac set up to switch spaces using codeCmd + Num/code but sometimes, out of the blue, they will stop working unless I do the command when in mission control. Anybody have any idea why this happens?  <answer195251> I've found that some mission control problems are resolved by restarting the "Dock" process (which handles the job of Mission Control).  If you care to try that, the Terminal command is:  strongkillall Dock/strong  (But first use strongkillall -s Dock/strong to make sure the command will only kill the one process.)  <comment188317> something else is using that key combo? Lots of apps use Cmd/num to switch views; it's not a great one to have swapped it to, tbh. <comment188353> It's odd, I use it without problem and it just seems to stop working at one point and not to anything at all. <comment188420> Try Ctrl/num instead & see how it goes. I've used that since Spaces was invented & never had a conflict.
