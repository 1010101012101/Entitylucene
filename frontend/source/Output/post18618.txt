Error when downloading Window support software under Boot Camp <body> Currently, I have already upgraded to Mac OS X Lion.  But an error occurred(Progress to the last 99%) that when I trying to downloading Windows support software via Boot Camp 4.0.  It says "Can't install Windows Support Software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server".  How can I do ? thanks  <answer21507> I had that exact same problem. I don't have an easy fix for it but what I did was just keep retrying and it eventually made it to 100% and worked fine.
