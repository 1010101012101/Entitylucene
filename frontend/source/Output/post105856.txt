How can I clear unwanted music off of my iphone? <body> My iphone shows me a variety of songs that I no longer want to have on it. iTunes does not show those items under 'Music' under the phone. I sync -- they're still there. What do I need to do to get rid of them? Contrary to various sources on the internet, sliding to the left on the song does not offer deletion, but starts to play it.   What's particularly vexatious is that I've got some Van Halen song on here. I've never seen it before. It does not show up on my Mac in itunes at all. I guess a child of mine might have purchased it.   I tried disabling icloud and setting up music syncing from itunes, and ran a sync, but that song and other undesirables persists.  <answer105857> You can delete them directly on your phone by sliding the song to the left on the songs list.   <answer105860> If you have ever had icloud enabled, you will see all the music you ever purchased in itunes. Even if you turn icloud emoff/em, that music will persist in your music app. The only way I found to get rid of it was to go to the itunes store in itunes and hide all the unwanted music. Once I had done that, they finally disappeared.   <answer131916> These songs are iTunes purchases that are available for download but not currently on your iPhone. To hide these:  strongSettings  iTunes &amp; App Store  Show All: Music = emOFF/em/strong  <answer131921> Use some 3rd party app like iFunbox to directly delete the song. Don't sync your device though.  <answer164295> Here’s how:  ul liGo to http://itunes.com/soi-remove. This will launch your iTunes Application. Click Remove Album./li liSign in with the Apple ID and password you use to buy from the iTunes Store./li liYou’ll see a confirmation message that the album has been removed from your account./li /ul  <comment124452> No I cannot. Sliding to the left just slides back to the list of 'albums, songs, artists'. <comment124453> Because the problem songs were 'icloud' songs. <comment192604> How does this solve the problem described in the question?
