‘Permission denied’ when trying to delete /var/db/.AppleSetupDone <body> I recently had a problem with an administrator account on my computer. When I looked into adding another, I came across code/sbin/mount -uaw/code and then coderm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code  I've used this code several times with success, but recently it has been saying "Permission denied." Is there any way to bypass this?  MacBook Pro with OS X Lion 10.7.5  <comment329162> in the above, I meant 'rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone' <comment329165> What ***exactly*** is the problem you are experiencing and what are you trying to accomplish?  This question is completely unclear.
