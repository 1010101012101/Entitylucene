Finder generic icons for music/movies on second drive <body> I have added an SSD to my iMac with OS X Lion and wanted to reorganise files a little:    ul liSystem and home folder on SSD  /li liMusic, Documents, movies on HDD/li /ul  That's not hard, but when I move the Music folder to Finder's sidebar I get a generic folder icon. Is there any way to get the music icon for that folder (which is on a different drive)? I find it visually quicker and easier to find the correct folders in the sidebar if they have custom icons.  Only solution I found is to use ColorfulSidebar.bundle and get Snow Leopard style color icons (and change them as you like in folders info panel), but I would like to have the newer gray style all over system. The ColorfulSidebar also does not work for in-app file browsing (you always get gray icons).  <answer105664> Unfortunately the icons now appear to be hardcoded, it used to be the case that you could just name a folder Movies in your home folder and it would gain the icon but not anymore.  According to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8380562/adding-buttons-to-finder-toolbar  DropBox are going to pretty extreme lengths to get their icon in the sidebar, using code injection.   In other words, I don't think it is possible I'm afraid.  <comment124248> Thats what I thought. thanx anyway! <comment124328> Not much of an answer I know, but please mark it if you think the topic is complete!
