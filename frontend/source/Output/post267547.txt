Is there a way to make the Enter key work with a Logitech K811 keyboard? <body> The key is labeled such that it looks like holding down fn and pressing Return will produce Enter (as with Apple’s keyboards). However, when I do that it only produces a regular Return.  <answer267572> If you don't need to use kbdfn/kbd otherwise, you could simply remap it to behave like kbdEnter/kbd. This is easily doable using the free tool Karabiner-Elements — download and install it, then add a "Simple Modification" from codefn/code to codekeypad_enter/code. If you want to only remap your external keyboard, then set the checkboxes in the Devices tab appropriately.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WwmXf.png" alt="Karabiner-Elements Preferences"  If you want to keep kbdfn/kbd's functionality, you need a more advanced remapping/macro utility such as BetterTouchTool or Keyboard Maestro. I'm not aware of any free options in this realm (though they may exist) besides the full version of Karabiner, which doesn't currently work on Sierra.  kbdfn/kbd is not a typical modifier key, so it can't be captured in the same ways that the others (e.g. kbd⌥/kbd and kbd⌘/kbd) can. Because of this, there is no way I'm aware of to assign kbdfn/kbdkbdreturn/kbd to anything. However, using one of the tools I mentioned, you can easily assign another hotkey to do the same thing, for example, kbd⌥/kbdkbdreturn/kbd.  <comment335935> Thanks for the suggestions, but what about the root issue? Shouldn’t it be able to produce Enter without remapping anything? I wonder whether this is a hardware or driver problem. <comment335939> @MichaelTsai Basically, the way the keyboard is programmed, the fn key is purely internal — when you press it with an F1-12 key, it sends a single key press signal to the computer. If you were to program some custom firmware you could alter that behavior, but I don't think it's possible otherwise. <comment335987> Sounds like you’re saying this is a hardware problem. The keyboard is sending the wrong signal. <comment335999> @MichaelTsai Well, in that it has to do with the keyboard itself, yes, but it's more a design flaw than a hardware problem. I actually have the same keyboard, and it works the same way for me. <comment336114> I see, so you don’t think it’s a defect in my particular unit? They just designed it not to support Enter? Thanks. <comment336115> @MichaelTsai Exactly. Unfortunate, but I'm pretty sure there's no way around it without hacking skills. <comment336116> Maybe write to Logitech and ask for a firmware update? <comment336125> I’ve written to their support. Will update if I hear anything interesting. <comment338043> Logitech support said that it’s supposed to support Enter, so the fact that it isn’t working is a hardware problem. They sent me a replacement K811, but it has the same problem. <comment338044> @MichaelTsai Sounds like they need to update the firmware then—now 3/3 of our sample size don't support it. <comment338222> Logitech now says that “the problem is the Operating System. Chances that the FN+Return is no longer supported as Enter.” However, I think you were right that the fn key is internal. I also tested the keyboard back to OS X 10.10 and got the same results. So if it’s an OS issue, it’s not a recent one.
