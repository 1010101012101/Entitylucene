2 Column Text plain text or markdown editor? <body> I'm looking for a text editor of some kind where it's split down the middle when editing 2 separate files.    I'm trying to translate some text and it would be helpful if I could have English and its meaning on 1 side and Spanish on the other.  Is there anything like this for OS X?  <answer107748> I'd recommend Sublime Text 2 or Sublime Text 3 beta. You can switch to 2 column mode from View - Layout - Columns: 2, or Cmd+Option+2. The app supports multiple syntax highlighting options (including markdown), but doesn't display formatted markdown.  <answer107793> VIM will accomplish this. The mac version is MacVim.  You can accomplish what you want by opening one file, then from the menu:   codeFile &gt; Split Diff with.../code  The output will look like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OSXW5.png" alt="enter image description here" with differences highlighted.  <answer115381> There is also Emacs where you can split a window horizontally:  horizontally http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/cs101/Help/Ref/JDETutorial/BobAmar/FileBuffer/split_window.jpg  vertically:  img src="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/tutorials/au-emacs5/image03.jpg" alt="vertically"  or in a more complicated fashion:  complicated http://www.ergoemacs.org/emacs/i/emacs_split.png  <comment126378> hmm.. i have sublime text and I guess I could use that but is there anything that will work with formatted markdown? just looking for something extremely simple <comment126381> I guess you could use [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) with two windows side by side...
