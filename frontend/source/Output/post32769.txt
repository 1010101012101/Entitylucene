Numbers: How can I display negative values in a column chart? <body> I am using Numbers '09 v2.1 (436) and I have a table having positive and some negative values. When in my project I add a emcolumn/em chart mapping properly data from that table it displays a chart without negative values. That is, "negative columns" aren't displayed in the chart, only "positive columns" are.  emHow can I display those negative values? Is it possible?/em  <answer91896> I tested this in Numbers '09 2.3 (554), and it worked for me without doing anything particularly special: see below.  Have I understood correctly?  http://f.cl.ly/items/1C3k1k0n1z1V383R0K3Y/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-20%20at%2018.49.34.png
