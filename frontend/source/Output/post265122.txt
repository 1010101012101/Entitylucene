Spotlight cache publishing not working <body> I'm trying to publish the spotlight index cache from a drive served from a mac mini to other macs so they can use spotlight to search for files. I tried to run this command on the host:  precodesudo mdutil -p /Volumes/SharedDrive /code/pre  but I am getting the following error:  precodeError: datastore publishing not implemented. /code/pre  It seams to be a permissions issue but I can't find how to fix it. There is one clue online pointing to the old hostconfig file apple got rid of but I'm not sure how to handle it in Sierra.
