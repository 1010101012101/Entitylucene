Cannot Purchase IAP, Continually Asks for Password <body> This is an iPad mini running 7.0.4. I am having trouble when trying to buy an IAP. It just continually asks for my iTunes PW (it's the correct PW). I often have trouble downloading apps as well.  I've tried a hard reboot, signing in and out of the app store, verified payment information, turning IAP off and on, and removing the sqlite file using iExplorer.  Any other suggestions before I reformat?  <comment131174> Do you have multiple Apple ID? <comment131211> No. Just one and works great on other devices.
