How do I send someone a normal text if they also use iMessage? <body> My brother has a Windows Phone, and an iPad. Whenever I try to text him, it sends him an iMessage to his iPad, not a text message. Since he does not always have his iPad with him, he doesn't get my texts most of the time.   Is there a way to choose when a message is sent via iMessage, or via SMS?  Right now, my solution is to have two separate contacts for him, but that is annoying.  <answer36323> Well, one way that I know you can do it is create a new Text Message, and hit the + icon.  Now, when you select your buddy, you should be able to select the phone number or the email address (since that is what your friend is probably using for iMessage).  Select the phone number and it strongshould/strong send it to his Windows Phone instead of his iPad.  <answer36327> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfN1q.jpg" alt="Choose to send as text message by tapping and holding the message till you see the option to send as text."  <answer67103> compose a new message, start typing your brother's name in the box, select his cellphone number.  <answer105488> Tap and hold the strongSend/strong button for about 3 seconds and iMessage will switch to text message.  <comment41351> Hope this helps <comment41356> You just have to do it right then and there.  You can't wait hours or days to send it as a Text Message (but then again, that kinda makes sense) <comment41358> Yes Mike, you're right. <comment45912> How do I make that option show up, I only get the Copy option. <comment50095> @DavidMiller The option to send as a text message only shows up right after you send the iMessage, if you wait and try to switch it later, it won't work. <comment79354> In this way you are not specifying if you are sending the text as an usual message or as an Apple iMessage.
