Can't download updates because "This update is not available for this Apple ID" <body> I keep getting this message when I type in my password to do an update.     This update is not available for this Apple ID either because it was bought by a different user or the item was refunded or cancelled.   The computer was bought by me and has only been used by me.  What do I need to do to fix this?  <answer269300> Try going to the "purchases" section in the App Store. Accept the free apps like iMovie and Garageband there.   <answer283214> After going around the houses with Apple Support, what fixed this for me was removing a duplicate version of the App in the Applications folder. There was a legacy version of GarageBand 6.0.5 in a folder as well as the latest version.  <comment338000> is this in the Mac App Store? And is it an operating system update or an app update? What version of OSX/MacOS? <comment338230> it's a 10.11.6 and it's an app update, iPhoto, iMovie and garageband and there's a security update.
