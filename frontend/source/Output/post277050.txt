iPhone is overriding my Account Email with a different address <body> I'm looking into an issue on an iPhone which has me stumped.  It has a number of Accounts configured:  ul liiCloud (myname@icloud.com)/li liExchange (myname@mycompany.com)/li liGmail (myname@gmail.com)/li liOutlook (myname@hotmail.com)/li /ul  iCloud and Exchange seem to work fine. But when we add the Outlook account (myname@hotmail.com), it is configured successfully, until it is saved, then the Email field in Account changes to show the Gmail address (myname@gmail.com) and will not change back.  The Mail app also shows two entries with the Gmail address when I try to switch the "from" account.  When I send an email from within the Outlook account within the Mail app, it displays the Gmail address (myname@gmail.com) as the "from" address, and replies go to Gmail.  I've tried:  ul liDeleting the Gmail account/li liDeleting the Outlook account/li liRe-adding the Outlook account (still has the same problem, even if the Gmail account is not present on the phone)/li liRe-adding the Outlook account as an Exchange account/li liFactory reset the phone and restore from backup/li liFactory reset the phone and start fresh/li liGet a new phone/li /ul  None of these steps have solved the problem, the phantom Gmail account (myname@gmail.com) always overrides the Outlook one (myname@hotmail.com), even if the Gmail account is not configured on the phone.  Interestingly, none of the other accounts have this issue.  I've also added a different Outlook account (myname2@hotmail.com) and this does not have the same problem either.  It appears to be something to do with adding an account called myname@hotmail.com but I'm absolutely stumped.  Has anyone encountered this issue, or can someone suggest some more troubleshooting steps please?  <answer278512> It appears this issue was being caused by having the Gmail account linked to the Outlook one on Outlook.com.  In the settings on Outlook.com, under strongMail  Accounts  Connected Accounts/strong, the Gmail account was set up as a Connected Account.  Removing this strongConnected Account/strong from Outlook.com resolved the issue and prevented the display name/email address of the account from changing.
