Repair un-eraseable USB stick <body> So, I have an Apple OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive Model A1384, and I'd like to erase it (specifically, to create a cute Apple-logo-branded macOS Sierra USB-install stick); unfortunately, it's not going well right now:  precode&gt; diskutil list /dev/disk0 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.9 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Kate's HD               1.9 TB     disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *8.1 GB     disk1    1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk1s1    2:         Apple_Driver_ATAPI                         2.0 KB     disk1s2    3:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X Install        4.2 GB     disk1s3  &gt; diskutil eraseDisk HFS+ %noformat% /dev/disk1 Started erase on disk1 Unmounting disk Error: -69877: Couldn't open device  &gt; diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/disk1                   Forced unmount of all volumes on disk1 was successful  &gt; diskutil eraseDisk HFS+ %noformat% /dev/disk1           Started erase on disk1 Unmounting disk Error: -69877: Couldn't open device /code/pre  Does anybody know how I can repair / restore this drive? I'd really like to use emthis specific drive/em, for obvious reasons; so “buy a new drive, they're cheap” isn't really a solution.  hr  emSystem profiler output/em:  precodeUSB DISK:    Product ID:   0x1502   Vendor ID:    0x05ac  (Apple Inc.)

Can I circumvent that with block-level access to the device, somehow? <comment317758> It's not a hardware restriction. It was programmed into the partition when it was written. If you have a Windows computer you could do this on, see this: http://superuser.com/questions/661585/how-to-remove-write-protection-from-a-write-protected-usb-drive-and-make-it-usa.   If not, you could try repartitioning the drive. You might be able to fool the drive into writing over the partition.
