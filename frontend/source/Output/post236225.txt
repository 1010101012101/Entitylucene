How to lock screen OSX without setting “immediately” in Security & Privacy settings <body> I would like to lock my OSX screen at any time, irrespective of whether "Immediately" is configured in the general tab in Security &amp; Privacy settings.  Is this possible?  Thanks  <answer236232> To lock your Mac’s screen, simultaneously press the following keys: codeControl + Shift + Eject/code. If you have a newer Mac that doesn’t have an optical drive (and thus has no eject key on the keyboard, such as the Retina MacBook Pro), the command is codeControl + Shift + Power/code.   In both cases, you’ll see your Mac’s display shut off immediately, while the system continues to run in the background.  <answer236269> The Keychain Access App is located in the Utilities subfolder of the Applications folder.  In the Keychain Access App, open strongPreferences/strong and under the strongGeneral/strong tab you can tick the box strongShow Keychain status in menu bar/strong. It'll put a padlock symbol that's resident in your menu bar that when clicked will provide you with a menu, the first menu item is strongLock Screen/strong. After setting the preference you can exit the Keychain Access App.  You can select the menu item to lock your screen.  <comment289064> I want to lock even when "Immediately" is not set, and that requieres "Immediately"  to be set <comment289268> You are the BOSS!
