Find Time Capsule HD Specs <body> How can I find out the specs from my Time Capsule hard drive? It doesn't appear in Disk Utility (a mounted disk). More specifically, I'd like to know the manufacturer and model, much like the System Information utility specs for my internal HD.  <comment79123> Before I can even hope to answer this, I need to know what type of drive is it? USB? Network volume? Are you using an actual Apple Time Capsule device or a generic hard drive?  Also, if it is an Apple Time Capsule, what generation is it? They used different models and suppliers for different generations of the device.
