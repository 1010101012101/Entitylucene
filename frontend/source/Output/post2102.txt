How can I sync Outlook with my iPad? <body> I have a Outlook synced with my HTC Hero, but now I also want to sync it with my new iPad.  However, I never touched an Apple product before, so I have absolutely no idea how to do this.   So can anyone explain me where these settings are hidden?  <answer2103> Use iTunes to Sync Your iPad With Your Outlook Calendar.  ul liUpdate iTunes in the computer to the recent version: click "Help" -- "Check for Updates."/li liUse the cable which comes with your iPad to connect it directly to new computer./li liiTunes will launch in the PC automatically./li liIn the iTunes source list, select your ipad and click on "Info" tab - the "Sync Outlook calendars" option. /li liIn the lower right-hand corner of your screen, you can find the "Apply" button. Click it on./li liThen your computer will sync with your iPad./li /ul  <answer2104> If you want it synced OTA, then you can sync outlook to a gmail account (both messages and calendar), then sync your iPad with the same gmail account. This has the advantage that things that show up in outlook show up pretty quickly on your iPad (not instantly - the gmail to outlook sync isn't instantaneous) without having to plug the iPad in.  <comment1784> Thanks that worked, that's what I get for trying to work around iTunes... <comment1785> Does this also sync contacts and calendar? <comment1786> Yes. I do this with my iPhone - outlook contacts and calendar sync up to gmail and then down to the phone. I actually said messages, but I haven't done that myself, and I should note that I might be wrong on that - you might have to grab mail directly from wherever it comes from (the iOS mail clients can connect to pretty much any kind of mail server directly).
