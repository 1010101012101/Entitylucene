Spotlight on Mac doesn't accept keyboard input <body> Periodically, Spotlight stops responding to keyboard input on my Mac. When this happens, pressing cmd-space brings up the Spotlight search field, but typing search terms has no effect. Characters don't appear in the search field, and even pressing codeESC/code doesn't exit from Spotlight. The keyboard continues to work normally in every other app-- only Spotlight is affected.  Rebooting restores normal operation but I'm hoping there's some non-reboot way to get things working again.  I'm running macOS 10.12.5 (16F73) on a 15" touch bar MacBook Pro. Both the internal keyboard and an external Apple USB keyboard are affected.  <answer285289> This seems to have worked. I'd still be interested in other answers people might have, in case there's something better.  ol liRun Activity Monitor/li liType "spotlight" in the search field./li liSeveral items will be remain. Select the one just named "Spotlight". Use the "x" button at the upper left corner of the window to kill it./li /ol  Spotlight automatically re-launches, and now works.  <comment359727> Have you tried rebuilding the Spotlight index? I've seen that it can fix some Spotlight issues, but I don't know about that one. <comment359729> No, because the problem isn't that Spotlight can't find results, it's that it's impossible to type search terms.in the first place. I'll try it in the spirit of covering all bases though. <comment359739> FWIW, that made no difference.
