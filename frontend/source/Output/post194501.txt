Open a file:/// url with #anchor from terminal <body> I've been trying to open a codefile:////code url e.g.  precodeopen "file:///Users/me/index.html#my-anchor" /code/pre  Or  precodeopen -a Safari "file:///Users/me/index.html#my-anchor" /code/pre  Or  precodeopen -a Google\ Chrome "file:///Users/me/index.html#my-anchor" /code/pre  However, the browser location after opening is:  precodefile:///Users/me/index.html /code/pre  The hash/anchor has been clobbered.  Is there some way to do this that I'm missing?  (Note: Obviously this isn't what happens with URL's on web servers)  <answer194873> Don't use the open command.  strongGoogle Chrome/strong:  precode/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome "file:///Users/me/index.html#my-anchor" /code/pre  strongSafari/strong:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to open location "file:///Users/me/index.html#my-anchor2"' /code/pre  <answer197284> A non-specific approach is:  precode osascript -e 'open location "file:///Users/me/index.html#my-anchor"' /code/pre  <comment232544> To be very clear the question is to open the file url via terminal / scripting.  The title is updated. <comment232566> I just changes my answer to what you need. Try the above commands in the terminal, I just did and they worked as expected. <comment232575> Not sure who else down voted you.  Please remove the initial answer from your post, that was never the intended question.  I will mark as correct when the noise is removed. <comment232576> âˆš Done. What do you need this for? <comment232577> Opening downloaded docs from Vim and Emacs and jumping to the relevant item.  Noticed open fails to pass the hash. <comment232578> The bigger problem is making this non-specific to a particular browser <comment235826> That is what we need! <comment235827> I've switched the correct answer mark to @tharps as it is what is really needed.
