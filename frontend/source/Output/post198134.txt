How to transfer voice memo *with their titles*? <body> Itunes doesn't keep title of voice memo which make them quite useless (they look like  DATE######.m4a)   I'm working with these memos, any solution would fit, (even jailbreak I really need to find a way).  Itune 12.2.1.16, windows7, iphone 3GS, IO6  <answer199426> strongEdit: Syncios is a safer alternative/strong  sThe only solution I found so far is a Chinese software called "Tungbu"./s Unlike Itunes it provides a simple solution to download voices memos with their titles (watch for the title characters lengths and forbidden characters).
