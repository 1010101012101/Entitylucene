Allow Standard users to add a VPN account <body> Is there a way to allow standard users to add a VPN connection? All computers are running 10.10.3  <answer192943> I found a sample of script that could be used in Automator for the non admin user to run, that would need to be customized by you (so it is a beginning). This is a example for to fire up virtualhost.sh.  To pass in your username and password to admin privileges:  precodeset vhostPath to "'" &amp; POSIX path of (path to me) &amp; ¬     "/Contents/Resources/virtualhost.sh" &amp; "'" set vhost to vhostPath &amp; space &amp; input do shell script vhost user name "user" password "pass" ¬     with administrator privileges /code/pre  change it to match your stuff  <comment229776> Did you consider creating a script for that, that will enable non admin user to create a VPN?
