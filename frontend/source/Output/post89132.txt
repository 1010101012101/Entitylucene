One-click automated USB trash delete <body> Is there any way I can create an automator service or app to delete ALL trash from any USB drive (my own account's trash plus everybody else's)?  I've read several solutions involving Terminal, including this one, but I'd like something a bit more foolproof and really handy.  I need to exchange USB drives regularly for presentations at events and Mac trash is becoming a problem as Macs become more common -- people suddenly get "no space available" error messages and can't do anything about it. I know how to skip the trash, but need a quick fix when the trash is already there.  <answer89139> Using Automator :   ul liCreate a new Service with automator /li liChange emService receives selected/em to files and folders/li liChange pass input to “as arguments” from “stdin”/li liAdd a strongRun ShellScript/strong action /li /ul  Use this script   precodefind /Volumes/ -maxdepth 2 -mindepth 2 | grep .Trashes | xargs rm -R /code/pre  ul liSave your new service/li /ul  It will be accessible from the right clic under the name you saved it.   <answer103596> 2 Solutions. 1 using Bash the other using Bash wrapped in AppleScript.  h2Solution #1/h2  ol liCreate a new AppleScript with code/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor/code/li liType the following code:  precodedo shell script "rm -rf /Volumes/*/.Trashes/*" with administrator privileges /code/pre/li liSave the file to somewhere convenient and run it whenever you need to clear the USB Trash/li liThis can be executed by double-clicking on it/li /ol  strongNOTE:/strong This will empty the Trash for all connected volumes including your internal hard disk.

It was because before I was editing in a different visual editor, and needed the escape character on them or it bolded the text or something stupid in between.
