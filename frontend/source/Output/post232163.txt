Security patch shows twice after Yosemite TM restore <body> So, Messages for OS X got broke by yesterday's Yosemite patch.  unable to send receive iMessages, SMS, nothing. I've seen some chatter to indicate I'm not the only one with the issue.  I lost yesterday morning trying to fix through forum suggestions, ended up reverting to a Time Machine backup... but not an old enough one, because the backup I restored had already been updated and thus had the Messages problem.  but weirdly, I see this when I check the App Store app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnjTv.png" alt="confounding update state"  Has anyone on Yosemite noticed this... is there already a patch to yesterday's patch? Or is this just a mystery...
