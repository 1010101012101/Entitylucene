BOOTCAMP no longer listed as Device in Finder, but can boot into it on startup <body> How can I get BOOTCAMP to be listed under Devices in Finder so that I can go into it and view the files there?  I can boot into BOOTCAMP as normal on startup but in OS X, Finder does not list BOOTCAMP.   It used to in OS X versions previous to OS X El Capitan, but I'm not sure exactly when it stopped showing and whether or not it's the OS X El Capitan upgrade or something else that caused the issue.   Here is the screenshot showing that BOOTCAMP is not listed in Finder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cBqBN.png" alt="Finder with Bootcamp not listed and settings"  Disk Utility shows the Macintosh HD and BOOTCAMP partitions, but only lists Macintosh HD on the left beneath the overall drive (Samsung 840 Pro SSD).

I was able to take Windows out of this state and now BOOTCAMP appears. I will accept my own answer when I am allowed to. More details of solution below.  I downloaded a trial of Paragon Disk Manager which showed the BOOTCAMP partition and provided an option to mount it. On attempting to mount, a dialogue popped up saying that the Windows operating system was in hibernate state and that it could not be mounted by accessing the partition by read-only operations; some write options would be required. I think an option was provided to proceed, but instead I decided to boot into Windows from start up as usual and attempt to fully and properly shut it down (as this is the least risky approach; better to get Windows to sort itself out regarding fully shut down and out of hibernate mode rather than from externally (i.e via an app in MacOS). There were some routine Windows updates ran but I don't think this is relevant. So after having shut Windows down. I started up into MacOS and can now see BOOTCAMP in finder. I don't work for Paragon or have any financial or otherwise interest in them, but the tool served a good purpose in that I could attempt to mount the partition which lead me to the solution.  I've seen something like this with dual-boot Windows / Ubuntu (Linux) systems whereby Ubuntu warns of same message about Windows being in a hibernate state when attempting to mount the Windows partition. So from that I conclude that the issue is not rare (and fortunately remediable). Ubuntu warns that attempting to mount is risky as it means it would have to modify the partition in order to mount it. Again it's therefore better to boot into Windows and fully shut it down. Not really sure why Windows would ever be hibernate mode when shut down though, but a "power cycle" seemed to get it out of this mode and into a fully shut down state.  So that's solved. However as a separate perhaps unrelated point I am concerned about the codegpt show: /dev/disk0: Suspicious MBR at sector 0/code message seen when running codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0/code as stated above. Any tips would be welcome, but my machine functions perfectly fine so this does not appear to affect it but I'd like to resolve this message anyway - research so far doesn't give a definitive answer it seems, I may write another question.  <comment301431> Please add the output from `sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0` <comment301432> David, I have now added this. Thank you. <comment301437> Normally, when a disk is using the GPT partitioning scheme, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th partitions in the MBR table are empty. Also, the 1st partition spans the entire disk (except for the MBR itself). In your case, in order for Windows to be installed, these conditions have not been met. The message is correct in the fact that the `gpt` command finds something *suspicious`, but is is normal for your model Mac and you should not be concerned. <comment301446> +1 upvote David for your input here. Thank you. <comment301448> +1 upvote David for your further input and reassurance, thank you! So it seems that this perhaps "false positive" message about suspicion is specific to the particular model I am using?  I would guess it's not seen on some other Mac models.  I certainly appreciate your input and want to follow your advice. Any background or links would be of interest to expand my knowledge, part out of enhancing my overall knowledge but also general perhaps irrational paranoia tendency I have. Thank you again. <comment301550> This error message occurs on all Mac models dated 2011 or earlier which also have Windows installed. The message can also occur on Mac models dated 2012 through 2014 depending on how Windows is installed. For 2015 and newer Mac's, this message should not occur when OS X and Windows are the only operation systems installed. In other words, the error message indicates your Mac is using what is referred to as the *hybrid* partition scheme. <comment301608> +1 thanks David for the additional information, most appreciated!
