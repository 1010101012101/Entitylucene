Recover data from disabled iPhone with known passcode <body> my friend broke his iPhone 4S digitizer in very unhappy way. He didn't have strongbackup/strong or strongsynced computers/strong and he had strongcellular data turn off/strong.  I successfully replaced digitizer and turn on the iPhone. Whow! strongemYour iPhone is disabled for 47 years/em/strong. Okay, so normally after battery replacement iPhone time is flushed and after reboot new time is fetched over NTP via cellular data, synced PC or already signed Wi-Fi. Not working in this case..  So theoretically there are two possible solutions:  ol liSomehow fetch or rewrite correct clock's value/li liMount NAND flash drive, export keys from CPU, merge it with passcode, decrypt data/li /ol  Any advice or experiences?  Thanks!
