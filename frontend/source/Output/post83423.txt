How to move a Reminder from one list to another in iOS? <body> There doesn't appear to be an option in Reminders to 'move to another list'  Is it really just a case of copy and paste, which would be pretty terrible  <answer83431> Using iOS 6.1.2 it is pretty straight forward (I have no older version of iOS with me to check how and if it works there, but I guess it will).  Tab on the task/reminder you would like to move to another list. Choose emmore options/em or emshow more/em (my language setting is German so I'm not 100% sure how this menu item is called in english). There appears an option titled emList/em. This will allow you to move the item to another list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Isb5E.jpg" alt="Choose task" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lh53v.jpg" alt="Choose more..." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qax1Y.jpg" alt="Change list"  <answer216447> My iPad is currently at IOS 9.1. I was able to move an item from one list to another by   ol liClicking edit (upper right corner)/li liSelecting the red symbol to the left of the item/li liChoosing the "More" option (in gray)/li liClicking "list" (fourth option down from the top)/li liChoosing the list to which you would like to change your item. /li /ol  Hope this helps!
