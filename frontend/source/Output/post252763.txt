Quick way to "link" to location on a shared SMB server? <body> I work at a small office where everyone uses Macs. We have a shared SMB server for storing files, which often contain spaces and other special characters.  Let's say that I have a folder containing important data for a coworker. Our current workflow is:  ol liI take a screenshot of the folder path in Finder: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0lTi0.png" alt="1]"/li liI attach this screenshot to an email and send it to my coworker./li liMy coworker uses the screenshot to emmanually navigate/em to the correct directory in Finder./li /ol  We do this many times each day, and it adds up. Step 3 in particular is quite annoying for the recipient.  Is there a technique we could use, or some software we could install, that would expedite this process? Ideally, I'd like the ability to email a "link" that, when clicked, would automatically open the directory in Finder.  Again, this method must be compatible with special characters, and should be easy to explain to less technically savvy users.  <answer252777> An easier method for sending links would be this:  ol liYou copy and paste the path of the folder from the "Get Info" dialog where you are getting your folder path screenshot. If you highlight the path like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vNNRB.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can copy the path using Edit  Copy or Command+C./li liPaste the path into the email using Edit  Paste or Command+V/li liMake the path a link - this will vary between email clients. As the link address, put in the file path./li liWhen your coworker gets it, they click the link in the email and it should open the folder in Finder (assuming they have the SMB server currently connected)./li /ol  This worked for me on El Capitan with Outlook as a mail client.  <answer252794> ol liRight-click the file or folder in Finder  Services  Copy full path/li liPaste the path into the email (I used Apple Mail)/li liThe recipient just has to choose the whole path in the email and right-click it  Reveal in Finder/li /ol  You don't have to escape spaces in the path with backslashes! The share has to be mounted already.  hr  If you don't find a service like "Copy Path" or "Copy full Path" you can simply create it yourself:  ol liLaunch Automator/li liCreate a new service/li liSearch for “Copy to Clipboard” and drag that into the rightside panel of the Service/li liSet ‘Service receives selected’ to “files or folders” and ‘in’ to “Finder” at the top of the service./li liSave the service as "Copy Path"/li liDepending on your system you can copy the path either by right-clicking an item  Copy Path or Services  Copy Path./li /ol  <comment314554> This will fail if the path has spaces. `smb://example.com/very important file` would end up as a broken link to `smb://example.com/very` <comment314556> There are two main stoppers: 1. The path needs to be url-encoded to work if there are spaces or special characters (spaces to `%20`, etc) and 2. The Finder tends to directly mount the last folder in the path. So `//server/files/important_files/secrets.txt` might mount as just the `important_files` directory, with no path hierarchy. <comment314557> Also Automator (and several scripting languages) can't seem to access the full `smb://` address, they all reference the file from its mount point in `/Volumes`. Similar question: [How can I copy the full smb:// link from a file in Finder?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/134492) <comment314611> This sounds promising, but I don't understand Step 1. There is no "copy full path" option in Finder's right click menu. <comment314629> It works fine for me if it has spaces - that might be an email client difference (like I said I'm using Outlook). An alternative to try is replacing spaces with "%20", as in `smb://example.com/very%20important%20file` - this is URL space encoding and also works for me in Outlook. <comment314678> Unfortunately, this doesn't happen in Apple Mail, and we cannot requires users to manually encode special characters. <comment314737> @Wowfunhappy Hmm, I have to investigate this. Maybe some 3rd party app/service is installed here. I suspect **Path Finder** has installed this service.
