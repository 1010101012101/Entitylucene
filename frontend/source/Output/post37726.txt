How can I get photos from my DSLR (with a CF card) to my iPad wirelessly? <body> I can shot tethered to my MBP (using LR3) but then how do I get them to the iPad wirelessly or better yet bypass the MBP altogether?

The Mac app is used to select folders of images The iPad app acts as a photo library.  <answer41120> You have a variety of choices!  Without using the MBP:  ol liA iPad card reader such as http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/ipad-cf-sd-reader/ (not supported by Apple) for CF cards./li liIf your DSLR has a USB port, get the Apple Camera Connection Kit and plug in your camera via USB.   This emmay not/em work, depending on your camera. It needs to support either Mass Storage Device or Picture Transfer Protocol. The older your camera, the less likely it is to support these transfer options. I recommend trying a connection kit belonging to a friend or a friendly shop first./li liGet an SD-CF adaptor for your camera, a SD card, and the Camera Connection Kit./li liGet an SD-CF adaptor for your camera, a Eye-Fi brand WiFi SD card, and their free iPad app./li /ol  Using the MBP:  ol liGet an SD-CF adaptor for your camera, a WiFi SD card, the latest iPhoto and sync via iCloud./li liTether your camera to your MBP, and use the latest iPhoto to sync via iCloud./li /ol  <comment46569> You might be better of asking this question on http://photo.stackexchange.com/
