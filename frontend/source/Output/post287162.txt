killall Dock - all active windows maximize and appear on Desktop <body> I have written python script to change desktop wallpaper.  After I change my wallpaper using the below code:  precodeapp('Finder').desktop_picture.set(mactypes.File(imageAddress)) /code/pre  I have added   precodeos.system("killall Dock") /code/pre  The wallpaper successfully changes, but all the active but minimized windows in the maximize. My question is  How do I refresh my Dock without changing the state of minimized/maximized windows?  <answer287177> I know of no way to keep minimized windows from being restored when executing abr codekillall Dock/code emcommand/em, by any method.  The long workaround is to enumerate all application processes with visible windows and make a list of all minimized windows before executing codekillall Dock/code and then use the list to re-minimize afterwards. I seriously don't recommend doing that, but it's doable if you want to spend the time coding it.  That said, why not just use a method that doesn't require using codekillall Dock/code and immediately changes the wallpaper?  Here are two examples using AppleScript:  precodetell application "Finder" to set desktop picture to POSIX file "/Library/Desktop Pictures/Milky Way.jpg" /code/pre  Or:  precodetell application "Finder" to set desktop picture to alias "Macintosh HD:Library:Desktop Pictures:Sierra.jpg" /code/pre  From the command line, e.g. in Terminal or shell based script:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to set desktop picture to POSIX file "/Library/Desktop Pictures/Milky Way.jpg"' /code/pre  Any of these immediately changes the wallpaper without further need to do anything.  <comment362596> I have to still use `killall Dock` for the changes to take place. Even when I run the above from my shell, unless I run `killall Dock`, the latest changes don't take place. <comment362644> @nakulchawla09, On my system running 10.12.5, the change in wallpaper is immediate and no need to use `killall Dock`.
