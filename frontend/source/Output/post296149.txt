Count cells with background color <body> In a range of cells, is there any way of counting the ones with certain background color?  <answer296185> Here is an example in strongAppleScript/strong that will emcount/em the number of emcells/em in a emrange/em that has the embackground color/em of red.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FHJ4l.png" alt="Numbers Image"  Note that the target strongNumbers/strong emdocument/em was open and in the background of strongScript Editor/strong.  When the emscript/em was run, it displayed the following dialog box.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GIdL4.png" alt="Display Dialog Image"  precode--  # User definded variables.  set theRange to "A1:L10"  --  # The background color of the rangeâ€™s cells. Expressed as a list of RGB (Red, Green, Blue)  --  #  values, from 0 to 65535. For example, the color red is: {65535, 0, 0}  set R to 65535 set G to 0 set B to 0   --  # Other variables.  set thisColor to "" set theRGBValue to {} set theCount to 0   tell application "Numbers"     tell document 1         tell sheet 1             tell table 1                 tell range theRange                     repeat with i from 1 to (cell count)                         set thisColor to background color of cell i as string                         if thisColor is not "" then                             set theRGBValue to (background color of cell i)                             if item 1 of theRGBValue is equal to R and item 2 of theRGBValue is equal to G and item 3 of theRGBValue is equal to B then                                 set theCount to theCount + 1                             end if                         end if                     end repeat                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell  display dialog "The cell count with the color {" &amp; R &amp; ", " &amp; G &amp; ", " &amp; B &amp; "} is: " &amp; theCount buttons {"OK"} default button 1 /code/pre  Note: This was tested on an old version of strongNumbers/strong (09 ver 2.3) and may need to be adjusted for newer versions.  If you do not know what the strongRGB/strong emvalue/em of a given codecell/code is, to plug into the emscript/em above, then to get the strongRGB/strong emvalue/em of the codebackground color/code of a given codecell/code, e.g. codeF5/code, use:  precodetell application "Numbers"     get background color of cell 1 of range "F5:F5" of table 1 of sheet 1 of document 1 end tell /code/pre  Just an FYI, I coded the main example further above in the long form and it could be condensed down to the following for the codetell application "Numbers"/code emblock/em:  precodetell application "Numbers"     tell range theRange of table 1 of sheet 1 of document 1         repeat with i from 1 to (cell count)             if (background color of cell i as string) is not "" then                 set theRGBValue to (background color of cell i)                 if item 1 of theRGBValue is equal to R and item 2 of theRGBValue is equal to G and item 3 of theRGBValue is equal to B then                     set theCount to theCount + 1                 end if             end if         end repeat     end tell end tell /code/pre
