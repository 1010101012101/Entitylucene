Syncing contacts and photos over wifi <body> I have an Iphone 5. Office 2007 on my laptop.   Strangely it will sync calendar entries, email accounts in either direction. However, for some strange reason it will not sync my contacts or photos automatically to my laptop when I am connected to my router.  It used to do this without any problems. It will also send my photos that I take on my Iphone to my Ipad over the wifi without a problem. If I connect the phone to the laptop via USB it still doesn't sync.  I have checked that all the software is up-to-date on all devices and checked that all the appropriate ticks are set up to do the syncing.  It used to do all this without any issues.  <comment132310> What OS do you have on your laptop?  Are you signed into iCloud on your laptop? <comment132440> Hi Thanks for coming back to me. I am running windows 7 on my laptop and it is signed into iCloud.
