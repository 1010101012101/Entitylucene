What version of OS X works best on a Mid 2010 MacBook 13" with Snow Leopard 10.6.8 <body> My MacBook 10.6.8 (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB 1066 MHz DDR3 RAM) What is the best OS X/macOS instead of Snow Leopard?  <answer280387> This Mac can run the latest OS - macOS 10.12 aka Sierra.  I would highly recommend you upgrade the RAM to at least 8GB and replace the HDD with a SSD.  This will breathe some new life into it.  <answer280401> I would install the highest level of macOS(/OS X) that you can. According to the Mactracker app that is OS X 10.11.6 (15G31) for this model. But if Conrad is correct and it lets you upgrade to 10.12, do it.   You may want to install some more RAM too. You can never have too much.  <comment352644> Where do you use your Mac for? <comment352645> I agree to this. With the latest macOS/OS X version you also have the latest security updates, but based on where the Mac is used for, there can be a better macOS/OS X version <comment352648> I recently upgraded my Mid-2009 white Macbook to El Captain and did very much regret it. I do a lot of video editing and transcoding and performance got down by more than factor 2 for no obvious reason (neither RAM nor SSD cache on my hybrid drive seem to be the limiting factor). So depending on the applications I would not recoomend to upgrade beyond Yosemite.
