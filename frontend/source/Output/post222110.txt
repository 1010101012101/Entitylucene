OS X Safari Comodo SSL issue <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D2XD4.png" alt="alert"  Strange issue on OS X Safari - visit Skiplex UK and you will receive an alert 'Safari can't verify the identity of the website "www.skiplex.co.uk".'.  I have been advised by Comodo and our hosting provider that SSL is setup correctly multiple times. The SSL is indeed working perfectly on all other browsers and operating systems including iOS.  It just seems to be an issue with the SSL on skiplex website. I can connect through to other websites using SSL, such as apple, google, etc.  Feel like I'm getting no where with this issue. Any ideas much appreciated.  strongAdditional Info/strong  ul liI'm using Safari Version 9.0.2.

I have tried following your advice and also the steps in article but unfortunately does not fix issue. I'm using Safari Version 9.0.2. I also know others experiencing same issue (on various versions of Safari) so unfortunately issue not local to my machine. Though good to know that not all OS X Safari users are experiencing the issue :) <comment269104> Yeah, in some cases it be a server-side-issue, however in this case I guess it's a local issue with your OS X installation. Somehow your root certificates aren't up-to-date due upgrades from OS X version.  Do you also experience these issues with Firefox and Chrome? <comment269137> What does it show about the root certificate in the chain ("COMODO RSA Certificate Authority")? <comment269310> Nope - only experience the issue on OS X Safari. All other browsers, including Firefox and Chrome, work fine. Strange! <comment269316> Thanks for comment. Following link is a screenshot after clicking "COMODO RSA Certificate Authority" - http://i.stack.imgur.com/s6obM.png <comment312471> Didn't work for me. The Comodo certificates always throw errors under Mac OS 10.8 <comment313316> @Foliovision: If possible, try updating to the latest macOS X version. macOS 10.8 is no longer supported since September 2015. <comment313553> Tom, I don't want to use the latest OS X. 10.8 runs better on this machine. That comment is not stackexchange caliber really. It's the kind of answer you'd get from the manufacturers call centre.
