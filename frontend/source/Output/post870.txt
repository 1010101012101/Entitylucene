How can I automate changing the quality of several photos? <body> I would like to be able to reduce the quality of the photos I have in a directory through some sort of automation.  One of the requirements is that I cannot change the dimensions of the photo.  The way I have been doing it so far is just by  ul liopening each photo in preview/li lichoosing save as/li liselecting jpeg/li liselecting a low quality/li lisaving/li /ul  This can take a long time when I have over 100 photos.  Is there an easy way to automate this with AppleScript, or through any other sort of means?  <answer871> Here is a simple Applescript that uses the Image Events built into OS X. Add salt to taste.  precodeproperty kFileList : {}  tell application "Finder"     set theSourceFolder to choose folder     set theDestinationFolder to choose folder      my createList(theSourceFolder)      set lastItem to (count kFileList)     repeat with thisItem from 1 to lastItem         set theFile to (theSourceFolder &amp; item thisItem of kFileList) as string          tell application "Image Events"             set theImage to open theFile             save theImage as JPEG2 in ((theDestinationFolder &amp; item thisItem of kFileList &amp; ".jpg") as string) with compression level high         end tell     end repeat end tell  on createList(mSource_folder)     set item_list to ""      tell application "System Events"         set item_list to get the name of every disk item of mSource_folder     end tell      set item_count to (get count of items in item_list)      repeat with i from 1 to item_count         set the_properties to ""          set the_item to item i of the item_list         set the_item to ((mSource_folder &amp; the_item) as string) as alias          tell application "System Events"             set file_info to get info for the_item         end tell          if visible of file_info is true then             set file_name to displayed name of file_info             set end of kFileList to file_name             if folder of file_info is true then                 my createList(the_item)             end if         end if      end repeat end createList /code/pre  Acorn is also good for cheap and easy automation via Applescript that will offer more choices than what Image Events, but Image Events is free so there's that  <comment28804> +1 Great question!
