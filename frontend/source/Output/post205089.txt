Move files from a single folder to multiple folders, based on filename <body> I have batch of files named A-01.pdf, A-02.pdf, B-01.pdf, B-02.pdf.... Then I have folder structure 01, 02, 03,.... How can I move all the files with 01 in there name to folder 01, all with 02 to folder 02 and so on?   There are a lot of scripts on the net but none of them seams to fit my case.  <answer205091> Assuming that these files are all in the same folder and the numbered folders are part of that folder as well, open Terminal and run  precodecd path/to/folder for i in *.pdf; do     mv "$i" "${i:2:2}/" done /code/pre  <answer205107> A script like @patrix's is probably the most efficient way, but if you're not comfortable with running shell scripts, you could do it with Automator, with a workflow that looked something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/osTO4.png" alt="First steps of potential workflow"  and so on for -03, -04 etc. (There's probably an even more efficient way to do it with Automator using loops and variables, but I've never tried using those...)
