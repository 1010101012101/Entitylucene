Restore photos to new iPhone from previous backup <body> I have a new iPhone 7 Plus and would like to restore only my photos to my new iPhone from my backup.  Is there a way to do that rather than restore the entire backup?  Thanks.  Jason  <answer264199> There are easy two ways to do this. You can turn on the iCloud photo library feature in your settings, this will backup your photos to your iCloud account and share them across your Apple devices.
