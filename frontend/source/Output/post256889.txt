How do I get my contact photos in Mail to match the ones in Contacts? <body> The contact photos displayed by Mail.app don't correspond to the photos in Contacts.app. Some images are cached but I can't figure out where they're cached. Other contacts emhave/em photos but they aren't being displayed by Mail. I'm guessing that there's some stale data somewhere in a cache. strongHow do get Mail to display the images that correspond to the photos in Contacts.app?/strong  I've tried randomly deleting different caches, but that hasn't helped. Thanks!
