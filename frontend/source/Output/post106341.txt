How to disable/always allow assistive access on Mavericks? <body> I've been using this script (AppleScript) bound to a global hot key as an Automator Service to open new terminals using a global keyboard shortcut. After upgrade to OS X Mavericks when the corresponding service is triggered from emliterally any/em application, a new dialog box popus up saying that      "(Application name)" would like to control this computer using accessibility features.   And of course script fails to execute triggered from any application which has not been explicitly given permission via System Preferences.  Is there some way to globally allow accessibility control to emany/em application running on my computer in OS X Mavericks, as it used to be in previous OS X releases?  The example script above was not the only script I had on global shortcuts, and whitelisting emall/em installed applications is extremely painful, especially considering that an app may be whitelisted only after a failed "control" attempt...  <answer107352> ol liChoose System Preferences from the Apple menu/li liClick on Security &amp; Privacy/li liClick on the Privacy tab/li liClick on Accessibility in the list at the left/li liClick the lock icon to allow you to make changes (you'll be prompted for your password)/li liCheck "(Application Name)"/li /ol  I don't believe there is a way to set this setting globally. You need to do it for each application separately. I would love to be proven wrong...  <answer110713> I don't know any way to always allow access for assistive devices, but you can add multiple applications to the list in System Preferences by drag and drop:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MusnW.png" alt=""
