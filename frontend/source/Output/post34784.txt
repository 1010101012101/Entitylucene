What options exist to restore tab completion using libedit in PSQL on OS X Lion? <body> It would appear that Apple have managed to get it utterly wrong with libedit emagain/em. The version shipped with Lion is apparently broken, and consequently tab completion doesn't work in psql (Discussion here). psql is one of the few tools that I tend to use directly from my macbook rather than on a vm and it would be lovely if it just worked. I've tried rlwrap and although it functions it doesn't support psql tab completion. I suppose I could install a new version of psql from source and link it directly against readline but I was wondering if:  ol li...anyone had found a workaround of some sort/li li...it was even vaguely credible to consider building an updated version of libedit and replacing the system version?/li /ol  <answer34785> Install macports, and then install the postgresql83 package.  sudo port install postgresql83  The macports psql works fine. Make sure you get it first on your path, e.g.:  PATH=/opt/local/lib/postgresql83/bin:$PATH
