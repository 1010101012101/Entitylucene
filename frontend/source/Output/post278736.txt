Adobe's Creative Cloud refuses to uninstall? <body> I never wanted CC on my computer and now it won't let me uninstall - comes up with "You still have Creative Cloud applications installed on your computer that require it."   The Adobe product on my computer is Lightroom; I've had it for years and don't run it through creative cloud. Do I have to get rid of this just to get rid of CC?   Apologies if it's obvious to people who know more.   Using 10.11.2 el capitan  <comment350872> If you open the Creative Cloud desktop app, do you see Lightroom listed? Or some other app(s) listed?
