What kind of RAM should I use for my iMac? <body> My Specs are as follows:  Model Name:    iMac   Model Identifier: iMac10,1   Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo   Processor Speed:  3.06 GHz   Number Of Processors: 1   Total Number Of Cores:    2   L2 Cache: 3 MB   Memory:   4 GB   Bus Speed:    1.07 GHz   Boot ROM Version: IM101.00CC.B00   SMC Version (system): 1.52f9   Serial Number (system):   W8008JEF5PC   Hardware UUID:    EECDACBD-AF6B-5B3E-B382-2702F2AA64AD  Current RAM: Memory Slots:  ECC:  Disabled  BANK 0/DIMM0:  Size: Empty   Type: Empty   Speed:    Empty   Status:   Empty   Manufacturer: Empty   Part Number:  Empty   Serial Number:    Empty  BANK 1/DIMM0:  Size: Empty   Type: Empty   Speed:    Empty   Status:   Empty   Manufacturer: Empty   Part Number:  Empty   Serial Number:    Empty  BANK 0/DIMM1:  Size: 2 GB   Type: DDR3   Speed:    1067 MHz   Status:   OK   Manufacturer: 0x80AD   Part Number:  0x484D54313235533642465238432D47372020   Serial Number:    0x108343E7  BANK 1/DIMM1:  Size: 2 GB   Type: DDR3   Speed:    1067 MHz   Status:   OK   Manufacturer: 0x80AD   Part Number:  0x484D54313235533642465238432D47372020   Serial Number:    0x101343E9  ol liWhat sort/kind of RAM should I purchase to improve the current RAM capacity?/li liShould I buy an extra 2 x 2GB RAM or 2 x 4GB?/li liWhich Slot should it be inserted to should I purchase the new RAMs?/li liWill it have a negative effect on the overall performance?/li /ol  <answer92412> Apple has a bunch of support articles on their Support site, just pick the one which applies to your model.  <answer92415> I second Patrix's answer.  As for the overall performance impact, as long as you install the correct type of RAM in duals (meaning 2 sticks of the same type), it should boost your performance.  You need to pay attention to how much RAM your iMac model takes as maximum. You already have 4GB; check if it's possible for you to replace both sticks to 2x4GB for a total of 8GB.  Update based on the comment below:  This article lists the steps necessary to add/change RAM for your iMac model. Your iMac model (Late 2009) contains 4 RAM slots; each slot can hold 4 GB maximum for a total of 16 GB RAM. The RAM type is SO-DIMMs strong1066 MHz DDR3/strong SDRAM. Here is an example from Newegg.com.  <answer92436> Getting a performance boost depends on what you actually do with the thing.  Run Activity-Monitor (ApplicationsUtilities) to see how much of your RAM is used.  Most Mac stuff runs well on 4GB, but if you run memory intense stuff (Parallels-Windows, Video Editing, editing large pictures with photoshop) you should see an improvement.  But even if you don't need the RAM, you should not see a performance penalty (i.e. it may or may not run better, but won't run worse).  Unless your computer is already slowing down to a crawl with the current configuration (when doing memory intense work), adding 2x 2GB should be enough (giving you a total of 8GB).  So, given your configuration, I'd add 2x 2GB to the free slots and keep the memory that is already there in the other slot.    <comment108406> 21.5" Screen                                            NVIDIA GeForce 9400:    Chipset Model: NVIDIA GeForce 9400   Type: GPU   Bus: PCI   VRAM (Total): 256 MB   Vendor: NVIDIA (0x10de)   Device ID: 0x0869   Revision ID: 0x00b1   ROM Revision: 3454   Displays: iMac:   Resolution: 1920 x 1080   Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)   Main Display: Yes   Mirror: Off   Online: Yes   Built-In: Yes Display Connector:   Status: No Display Connected <comment108417> Check the update to my answer above. <comment115284> but if I know manufacturer, what cards should I install? My manufacturer is `0x80AD` (Macbook Pro Late 2011)
