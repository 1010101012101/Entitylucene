External USB 3.0 Seagate HDD No Longer Mounting <body> Out of nowhere my 1 TB Seagate FA GoFlex won't mount my Mac formatted partition (the only partition).  I have run repair disk on the drive and on the partition and find no errors.  I still get an error when I try to mount the partition.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ycfU7.png" alt="Disk Utility Window"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9PCV.png" alt="Error PopUp"
