Getting kernel panics on Macbook Pro <body> I am getting kernel panics on reboots for a few weeks now. They seem to be caused by an Oracle kernel extensions(I will add an image of the stacktrace).  I am using a MacBook Pro 15" retina mid 2014 model with MacOS Sierra.  I assumed that it was caused by VirtualBox, however I uninstalled it and removed the kext with their script and I ran in a kernel panic once again.  I scanned my SSD with the Disk Utility tool and it showed no errors. Reinstalling MacOS helps temporarily until I restart again.   I appreciate your help.  emAttempt to clean up photo/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q0AUQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  emoriginal here for ref/em  <answer287530> I fixed the Kernel Panic by formatting my hard drive and reinstalling my OS.  <comment360194> The oracle kext is still there... <comment360199> At the very top of your kernel panic is the message "page fault" which points to a memory issue.  I would at minimum run [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.    Also, try removing 1 of the SO-DIMMs and see if the problem goes away.  If not, swap SO-DIMMs and slots to see if there's any change. <comment360206> The apple hardware test did not show any errors. Also, I won't be able to remove the SO-DIMMs since they are fixed on the motherboard on mac version 11.3. <comment360207> @Tetsujin I have searched in /Library/Extensions and /System/Library/Extension for this specific Oracle kext however I can't find it there... <comment360213> @Allan - not that I'm any kind of expert on the inner workings of memory - but isn't a page fault usually just a memory call that needed to be called from pagefile - or does that no longer apply once we're in panic & at that point it must be an actual invalid condition which cannot be handled, an address that simply doesn't exist? <comment360217> @DimitriTyan - they can be in other places too. The surest way to find them is to get [EasyFind](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/easyfind/id411673888?mt=12) (freeware) Set search for .kext [inc the. ], entire boot drive,  only files, all words, ignore case, + invisibles. That will find things that Spotlight certainly won't. [it's quite slow, but it's good]
