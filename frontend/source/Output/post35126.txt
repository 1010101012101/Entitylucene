Secure erase drive in Single User Mode <body> My 2007 Macbook Pro has suffered from a failure of its GPU and will now only boot in Single User mode.    I want to sell it on eBay for spares, but obviously I don't want a hard drive with live data on it ending up on eBay.    I know you can destroy a drive's contents with a secure erase in Disk Utility, but as I said, I can't boot into any mode that requires graphics because the GPU is dead.    How do I secure erase the machine's drive in Single User mode?    <answer35128> Normally from the command line, you would use the strongdiskutil/strong command with the strongzeroDisk, randomDisk/strong or strongsecureErase/strong options to securely wipe a disk. However, I would imagine this doesn't work on the disk you've just booted from. So I suspect you'll either have to find another Mac and connect yours in target disk mode via a Firewire cable, or physically remove the drive and connect it to another Mac using a disk caddy, to wipe it the way you wish.  <answer89871> If you want to completely wipe it, I'd think you could type this in single-user mode, hitting return after each "-----": /sbin/mount -uw / ----- rm -rf *  <answer89927> It should be possible to boot an external drive (including the installation DVD) in single user mode:  strongHold Option as you turn the power on, select/strong the DVD/HDD strongwith the arrow keys then press and hold Command+S+Return/strong, holding them down until you see the now-familiar-for-you console boot: at which point it would be possible to use a whole disk shredder as mentioned by scottishwildcat.  <answer249776> Had the same task. And finally I've found the way to do it without other mac.  ol liBoot in single user mode from external hdd / recovery. (see @Ryccardo answer). Note: you can't erase partition you booted from./li liCreate new partition in place of one you want to erase: code newfs_hfs -J 0 /dev/diskXsY /code Make sure to change X &amp; Y in diskstrongX/strongsstrongY/strong to proper values.br emNote: create with journal (-J option) to override previous journal, which can make impossible to mount partition in single user mode./em/li liMount created partition./li liFill partition with (random) data. The easiest way is to create large file(s) to occupy all space. You can use codeopenssl rand/code or codedd of=… bs=… count=…/code as described in answers of this question./li liOptional: securely remove created file(s) with codesrm/code./li /ol  emNote: strongmaybe/strong this method will not fully erase data such as previous files' names / dir structures, if such data stored in some system areas of fs. I'm not sure, because I don't know how HFS+ stored. But in my case it's not a problem./em  <comment40018> If you're selling for spares, you could sell sans-HDD (which won't effect it's value much, as it's a four year old used HDD) and not need to worry about it? <comment40066> That thought had occurred, but it's one of those pre-unibody machines that are not exactly easy to get into.  I'd prefer avoiding that if I can. <comment105563> Once you have unmounted `/`, where exactly would the binary for `rm` come from? <comment105605> @patrix: his reasoning is actually sound (`mount -uw` means remount while making writable and the command is obviously loaded in RAM before it starts acting), but apart from not being a secure erasing tool (at least with the supplied command line) -- what if it fails? How would you repeat it? <comment309917> Thanks, I've searched a way to boot from different partition in single user / safe mode. Actually, there is no need to hold **Return** key, just press it once.
