System Integrity Protection prevents Trash from being emptied <body> I have no idea how two files ended up in Trash, but I suspect AppDelete to be the culprit. Anyway, the first file is strongDeviceLink.framework/strong and the other is strongMobileDevice.framework/strong.  Any idea how to remove them from trash so I can finally be able to empty it?  <answer260759> Shutdown your laptop.br/ Press Command + R and then the power button to boot into recovery mode.br/ Click the Utilities menu and select Terminal.br/ Type codecsrutil disable/code and press return.br/ Close the Terminal app and restart out of recovery mode.br/br/ Login to your machine normally and launch the Terminal app on your Mac by either searching for it in Spotlight or locating it in the Utilities folder under Applications.br/ In Terminal enter this command codesudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/*/code it'll ask for your login password. That should clear your trash. br/br/ If that worked re-enable SIP.br/ Shutdown your laptop.br/ Press Command + R and then the power button to boot into recovery mode.br/ Click the Utilities menu and select Terminal.br/ Type codecsrutil enable/code and press return.br/ Close the Terminal app and restart out of recovery mode.br/br/  <answer278951> In my case, I had an old backup of my old boot disk and I deleted all files in it. But, some files got stuck and will never go away.  Please note that I have a separate boot disk now and its safe to delete stubborn files from old disk. Please do not try until you know what you are doing.  For me this worked:  Open Terminal  precodecd /Volumes ls -la /code/pre  Check the old boot drive mount point.  precodecd old_boot_drive cd .Trashes sudo ls -la /code/pre  You will not see your files, but you will see a folder, in my case it was 501.  precodecd 501 sudo ls -la /code/pre  Now, you will see the list of all stubborn files in the Trash. Delete them one by one.  precodesudo rm -rf file1 sudo rm -rf folder2 /code/pre  To delete files OR folders with blank spaces or special characters in them. Please use double quotes.  precodesudo rm -rf "folder with blanks" /code/pre  As soon as all files are deleted you will see that Trash icon on your Mac will appear blank now.  Hope it helps someone.  <comment326572> Thanks a lot man it worked like a charm. <comment359341> FYI, after disabling CIP and restarting normally, I was able to empty the trash from the Finder, without resorting to the command line. It did ask if I wanted to delete locked files.
