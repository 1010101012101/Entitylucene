Is it possible to reset launchpad layout? <body> My launchpad has become very cluttered overtime. I'm wondering if there is a function to reset launchpad like the iOS reset home screen layout feature. Let me know in the comments if you don't understand what I'm asking.  <answer218034> To reset Launchpad to the default, delete the following file:  precode/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Dock/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.db /code/pre  ul liWhere "xxxx..." in the file name is an alphanumeric string./li /ul  And then run the following command in a Terminal:  precode killall Dock /code/pre  The Launchpad is now reset to the default and a new database (.db file) will be created with the default settings.  Note:  If you want to examine the contents of the database you can use an app like Liya.  <comment263875> Does this remove all the app icons? I want to be perfectly clear before doing this :) <comment263951> @www139, I've tested this on my own system and saw no adverse effects.  One should not just delete a file without having a backup so as to be able to revert to the previous state if needed/wanted. As to  "_Does this remove all the app icons?_", in what context are you referring to? I had my Launchpad set alphabetical using LaunchpadCleaner and when I manually removed the target file and `killall Dock` the Launchpad was reset to having the OS X default apps first as arranged upon first boot and everything I installed since came after the default apps. All icons still showed as I expected. <comment264006> Great, that is what I was looking for :)
