Apple Watch iOS 3 control center does not show unlock symbol any longer <body> Some days ago I mentioned by accident that my Apple Watch control center (the menu which appears when you swipe from bottom to top) does no longer show the symbol to lock the watch. My wifes Apple Watch still contains this lock button, so I'm wondering what I need to do to let it reappear. Any ideas?  Thanks Markus  <answer269338> Did you get the os version 3.1.1?   It seems that with 3.1.1 the "problem" is considered a "feature", i.e. was intentionally removed (see http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/12/14/watchos-3-1-1-disables-lock-feature-in-control-center-here-are-four-workarounds/ )  The article also lists various workarounds, the best seems to be disabling wrist detection (Settings → General → Wrist Detection)   The others are   ol liUse Water-Lock instead /li liLock your watch via Workout app/li /ol  <comment338331> That appears to be right (I wonder why I didn't find that article).
