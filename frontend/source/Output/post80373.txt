Is there any keyboard hotkey to undo hiding an application? <body> I use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdH/kbd to hide applications all the time. Sometimes I really want to undo that action, but pressing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdH/kbd again will just hide the now active application.  Pressing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdH/kbd doesn't do it either.  I don't know if there's a way to do this built into OSX, but if not I wouldn't be opposed to installing an application that would provide this functionality.  <answer80383> Doing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd will let you go through all the running applications, even if it's hidden. More tricks are discussed at SuperUser.  <comment92860> Exactly what I wanted. I didn't even think of `Command+Tab` because I associate it with cycling through active applications. The hidden application is the most recently active, so it will be the first result.
