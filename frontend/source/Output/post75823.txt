How do I set up a Mail.app rule for removing attachments? <body> While Mail.app offers a menu item for removing attachments from e-mail, I find myself wanting to make a rule for removing attachments from e-mails. Anyone knows how that can be done? AppleScript, perhaps?  So basically, a Mail.app rule that works like this:  ol liIf sender is suchandsuch and attachment type is executable (this is already possible)./li liRemove attachments from e-mail/li /ol  <answer75830> I just made a screencast how to do this (however, you have to delete the message in order to remove the executable):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qN05b.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment88013> Your rule moves any mail with an executable attached into a specific mailbox. This isn't exactly what the question was asking for... <comment88014> In Apple Script, attachments can apparently only be saved but not deleted. <comment88038> Yeah, deleting the e-mail kinda defeats the purpose – I just want to get rid of the attachment :)
