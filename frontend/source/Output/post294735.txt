Outlook 15.36 - Exchange, won't auto sync 2nd or 3rd email address - AppleScript workaround <body> I have an Exchange address which has 2 other email addresses associated with it... It will auto sync (get new mail) from the primary account, but not from the others... Already researched and found it to be a known problem.   I am trying to write an AppleScript that I can auto run to accomplish this task... something along these lines, but it doesn't work:  precodeif application "Microsoft Outlook" is running then     tell application "Microsoft Outlook"         sync exchange account "Account Name"     end tell end if /code/pre  or maybe a "sync all"  If I go to Outlook and hit the Send &amp; Receive button, it fetches the new mail from all accounts. But not until I do that manually.  I'm trying to get the AppleScript to force a sync every x number of mins.  h2NOTE:/h2  I first did this, which does work... BUT it flashes the app open and also messes with my active window... which is disruptive to workflow.  precodeif  application "Microsoft Outlook" is running then     tell application "Microsoft Outlook" to activate     tell application "System Events"     keystroke "k" using command down     keystroke "h" using command down     end tell end if /code/pre  I cannot seem to find the right syntax to trigger the Send &amp; Receive event without activating the Outlook window to do it via keystroke.
