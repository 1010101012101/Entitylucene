install gpg with homebrew <body> I want to install a new version of coderuby/code via codervm/code. To install that, I need codegnupg2/code. I installed it using codebrew/code, but it could not be linked.  I get the following error message when linking with codebrew link gpg2/code:  precodeLinking /usr/local/Cellar/gnupg/2.1.20...  Error: Could not symlink bin/gpg-agent Target /usr/local/bin/gpg-agent is a symlink belonging to gpg-agent. You can unlink it: brew unlink gpg-agent  To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files: brew link --overwrite gnupg  To list all files that would be deleted: brew link --overwrite --dry-run gnupg /code/pre  I have no idea what the codegpg-agent/code does and if I can savely overwrite the link without destroying something that my system somewhere needs.   <answer281014> By default, macOS does not use anything under code/usr/local/code, so yes you can codebrew link --overwrite gnupg/code safely.  <comment353526> ok. thanks. but why doesn't brew link it automatically like it normally does? <comment353555> Becasue somehow there's already a `/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent` file. Maybe from a past install of gnupg or GPGTools? <comment353757> Now it is successfully linked, but after typing `gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3` (as written in the manual on https://rvm.io/rvm/install), I get the error message: `gpg: Empfangen vom Schl"usselserver fehlgeschlagen: No route to host`, where the first part is german and means: "Receiving of Keyserver failed". Do you have any idea, what causes this? <comment353913> Sounds like a GPG issue, I used to encounter this with GPG on MacPorts but have yet to fix it. Googling around shows some people which managed to fix it.
