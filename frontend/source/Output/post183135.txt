Multiple finder preference plists in mavericks <body> Iâ€™ve had a very sluggish Finder recently on my Mid-2012 MBP 16GB 2.6GHz i7.   Looking online I found that deleting the Finder preferences can solve the issue, but when I went to the codePreferences/code folder to look for codecom.apple.finder.plist/code I also found files like these: codecom.apple.finder.plist.DUkfEQe/code and codecom.apple.finder.plist.DUkfEQe2/code and others with random strings at the end. Any idea what these are and which one is my 'actual' finder plist?  <answer183138> The codecom.apple.finder.plist/code file is the actual file.  I believe the ones with a random extension are renamed originals used to hold the changes until the .plist file is updated and then are deleted.
