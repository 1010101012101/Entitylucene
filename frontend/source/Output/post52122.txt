Apple Wi-Fi Dropping at Random Times <body> I'm sure that my Wi-Fi router is fine because my MacBook is the only one with this issue.  I see this happen especially when I use Skype, FaceTime, etc.  This has been going on for a month and can't really find a fix.   I did see that OS X 10.7 Lion has some connectivity issue but don't think it has been solved.  I have tried many tips told by other users.  I hope someone from here can help me.  I get an error saying  "Connection Timeout".  Thank You  <comment59640> You've used Wi-Fi Diagnostics.app (in System/Library/Core Services) to monitor signal/noise over time? There may be some new noise source in your neighborhood that's intermittently interfering with your signal. <comment59644> I ran the tool... looks like its fine. <comment59696> What router are you using?
