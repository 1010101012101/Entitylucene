Signed iOS app "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" <body> I am a registered iOS developer. I generated an IPA file using a signing identity that qualifies for App Store submission.  I sent my client this IPA file but macOS won't open it. It claims that this file comes from an unidentified developer. While there is a workaround by option-clicking the file, I want to know how a client can set Gatekeeper to trust all app files signed by a given identity.  It is likly that the client is running Mountain Lion or Sierra.  <comment361916> ipa file for Mac? <comment361956> You should always be able to allow apps from unidentifiable developers from System Preferences  Security. <comment362052> @DonielF: The client doesn't want the Mac to be able to open just any application.
