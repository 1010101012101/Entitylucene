Missing disk space after canceled RSYNC-transfer <body> I have a small rsync script for backing up folders from my MacBook's HDD and from an USB-connected HDD to an external HDD (SMB-mapped Synology drive). All worked fine in the last month and years, but last week I had to cancel the transfer, because my Mac's HDD got full of data during the active running RSYNC-script (I don't really understand why such an enormous amount of data is necessary on my Mac's HDD during the file transfer; I had more than 30 GB of free disk space). After canceling the rsync-script in Terminal the used disk space for the transfer was not released.   I already tried to restart my Mac and have looked into various system folders (/tmp, /var, ...) and couldn't find any huge data amounts there. We are talking of around 30-40 GB.   I have no idea of what to do now... I need to reset my whole MacBook if I can't find a solution for this problem. I have no space left on my HDD.  Thank you very much for any useful hints to this problem.  <comment314969> Please include the (complete) rsync script in your question!
