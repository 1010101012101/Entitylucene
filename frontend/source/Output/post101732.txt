AppleScript Setting Select Drop Down <body> I am trying to enable dictation with applescript and so far have the following that works.br But, stronghow do I set the drop down for the shortcut key using AppleScript?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GqfW0.png" alt="enter image description here"  Below is the AppleScript code:  precodetell application "System Preferences" reveal pane id "com.apple.preference.speech"  tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         tell window "Dictation &amp; Speech"             tell tab group 1                 click radio button "Dictation"                 tell radio group 1                     if value of radio button "On" is 0 then                         click radio button "On"                      end if                 end tell             end tell             if sheet 1 exists then                 tell sheet 1                     click button "Enable Dictation"                     repeat while sheet 1 exists                     end repeat                 end tell             end if         end tell     end tell end tell quit -- optional end tell /code/pre  <answer101734> Using the shell strongDefaults/strong command in an Applescript Do shell script seems to work ok for me. This will save on GUI scripting problems.  The script first reads the preference file. Then sets it to the opposite of its Bool.  precodeset dictionToggle to (do shell script " defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.assistant.support \"Dictation Enabled\" ") as integer  do shell script "defaults write  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.assistant.support \"Dictation Enabled\" -bool " &amp; (not (dictionToggle as boolean)) as Unicode text /code/pre  hr  I always backup any preference files using the contextual menu emcompress "…."/em  to make a zipped copy of it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HyKe1.png" alt="enter image description here"  The file strongcom.apple.assistant.support.plist/strong that is changed is found in your preferences folder  /Users/UserName/Library/Preferences/strongcom.apple.assistant.support.plist/strong  hr  If you have to use GUI scripting especially if you want to change the short cut keys. ( and since I cannot be Ars… to figure out which one of the symbolic  hotkey settings in the com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist is the right one)  Then this should work. (as it does on my Mac at least :-)  )  precode  set off to 1 set fnTwice to 3 set rightCommandTwice to 4 set leftCommandTwice to 5 set eitherCommandTwice to 6   tell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.speech"     reveal (first anchor of current pane whose name is "Dictation")  end tell tell application "System Events"      tell application process "System Preferences"         set theGroup to tab group 1 of window "Dictation &amp; Speech"         click radio button "On" of radio group 1 of theGroup          try             click button "Enable Dictation" of sheet 1 of window "Dictation &amp; Speech"         end try         set thePopUp to pop up button 2 of theGroup         click thePopUp         click menu item fnTwice of menu 1 of thePopUp     end tell end tell tell application "System Preferences"     --quit end tell /code/pre  <comment119850> How can I set the drop down menu "Shortcut"? <comment119853> Updated to show you.
