Had free GarageBand now it's the full version. Never paid for it, what happened? <body> I had free GarageBand on my old phone, didn't use it for a bit, went back to it and now it's the full version...  I never paid for anything, and I don't believe in a "free lunch"...  So what's up with that?  I honestly have no idea how this happened?  Should I delete it and get it again legitimately?  <answer227713> If you have gotten a new 64gb iPhone starting with the 5s, iWork and iLife apps come pre-installed. You don't have to purchase them once you purchase a new device. The same is true for an iPad.   <comment277270> Have you recently purchased a new iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch)?
