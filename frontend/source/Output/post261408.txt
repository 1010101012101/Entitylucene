postfix: warning: /etc/postfix/main.cf, line 690: overriding earlier entry: config_directory=/etc/postfix <body> I had a mail service working fine before till i made this upgrade in Server App and OSX.  I came from Server app 3 and OSX 10.9.5 to OSX 10.11.6 to Server app 5 and OSX 10.12.1, and when i tried to reload postfix in this version, i receive several warnings,  precoderemote:~ root# postfix reload postfix: warning: /etc/postfix/main.cf, line 690: overriding earlier entry: config_directory=/etc/postfix /usr/sbin/postconf: warning: /etc/postfix/main.cf, line 690: overriding earlier entry: config_directory=/etc/postfix /usr/sbin/postconf: warning: /etc/postfix/main.cf: unused parameter: use_sacl_cache=yes /usr/sbin/postconf: warning: /etc/postfix/main.cf: unused parameter: imap_submit_cred_file=/Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/submit.cred /usr/sbin/postconf: warning: /etc/postfix/main.cf: unused parameter: mydomain_fallback=localhost postfix/postlog: warning: /etc/postfix/main.cf, line 690: overriding earlier entry: config_directory=/etc/postfix postfix/postfix-script: refreshing the Postfix mail system postsuper: warning: /etc/postfix/main.cf, line 690: overriding earlier entry: config_directory=/etc/postfix /code/pre  I have tried some solutions from apple discussions (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6784876?start=0&amp;tstart=0) but i continue to receive the same output.  I am using my mail service as it came by default, i have not made any configuration, with old settings that i was using before.  Inside of that /etc/postfix/main.cf there is no config_directory=/etc/postfix,  precodemydomain_fallback = localhost message_size_limit = 10485760 biff = no mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8, [::1]/128 smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks permit_sasl_authenticated permit recipient_delimiter = + smtpd_tls_ciphers = medium inet_protocols = all inet_interfaces = all config_directory = /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix server_config_directory = /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix compatibility_level = 2 /code/pre  Other entries are in this file.  Dont know but that missing entry of config_directory=/etc/postfix could be the problem and from what i am seeing it could be a problem when someone come from a previous versions of Server App/OSX. I am not sure but the system must assume old values from previous configurations, and it fails in this new version. The best way to solve this it could be from comparing with one fresh postfix installation.  Any one knows other ways to solve this?   <answer261926> I have the same problem using postfix reload in Yosemite server, with the same error. Postfix is running, however, and I can restart it by using the GUI in server.  Sierra's postfix config files are, in fact, in  code/Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix//code and the files in code/etc/postfix/code are not used and obsolete. Changing files in code/etc/postfix/code won't do you any good. The file you need to sort out is code/Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/main.cf/code  <comment328095> Those where obsolent entries, it seems that in Yosemite have add already those entries elsewhere but at least postfix was working properly.  Now i have upgraded my Server app and OSX to the latest Server app 5 and OSX sierra, and i seriously dont recommend this. Apple have turned postfix and dovecot into Server App. Now you dont have control over both MTA and MDA like before through terminal.
