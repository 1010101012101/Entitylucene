Clone a NetBoot Drive <body> I am in a small pickle. Basically, I have a netboot server (I think, when you press option at startup, drives with small globes appear) but I cannot access it locally, and I need to clone it to a local drive. Is there anyway I can do this over the network?    I cannot see them in Finder or DiskUtility, would this mean they are hidden?  precodeNetBoot Server ----&gt; Network ----&gt; MacBook Pro                         |                                              V                      Clone NetBoot Image -------------&gt; MacBook Pro /code/pre
