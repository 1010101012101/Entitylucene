HFS+ Partition of Mac OSX is not recognized in Windows 10 Bootcamp <body> I installed triple systems (Mac, Windows, Linux) on my Macbook Pro retina mid 2014 with rEFInd boot loader. Hfs+ partition used to be visible in Windows 8.1 Bootcamp.  But after updating to Windows 10, it doesn't show up again. I don't enable FileVault. HFS+ drivers installed on Windows 10 with the latest Bootcamp support drivers.  Please help! Thank you so much.  Below is the output from the following Terminal application commands.  precodediskutil list diskutil cs list sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Gi5W.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer237162> Your computer uses two partition tables stored on your internal drive. The first is the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table and the second is the GUID Partition Table (GPT). You used the commands codefdisk/code and codegpt/code to print out most of the contents of the MBR partition table and GPT, respectively.  For the most part, Windows (booted via BIOS) ignores the GPT and uses the MBR table exclusively to determine the partitions on your internal drive. For Macs, the usual requirement is for the first partition in the MBR table to have an id=codeEE/code. Also this partition should start at a Logical Block Address (LBA) of 1 and end at the same LBA as the EFI partition in the GPT. (The EFI partition has an GUID=codeC12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B/code.)  Your MBR partition table contains the following problems:  ol liYour first partition (id=codeEE/code) extends past the EFI partition in the GPT. In fact, this partition covers the first three partitions in the GPT./li liThe last partition (number 4) is empty. This probably where the HFS+ partition information was stored before you updated to Windows 10./li liThe partitions are not in ascending order. I do not know if this one has to be fixed. For now, I will ignore this problem./li /ol  One of the easiest commands that can fix these types of problems is codegdisk/code. This command can be found in most Linux installs. Below is a example of how to use the command to fix your Mac. In the example, this command was run under OS X. I assume you will be using Linux, therefore you should substitute code/dev/sda/code for code/dev/disk0/code.   precodeSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ gdisk /dev/disk0 GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded!

Instructions for testing are given [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/169680/does-windows-running-on-latest-apple-computers-see-boot-disk-partitioned-as-mb). Also, could you post, to your answer, the output from the following Terminal application commands: `diskutil  list`, `diskutil  cs  list`, `sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0` and `sudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0`. These commands will not change your computer. Some may ask for your login password. This is normal. <comment290340> Windows 10 boots in BIOS. <comment290341> http://i.imgur.com/kKe6HQ3.png Here are the results by running those commands. Thank you so much! <comment290342> I need to know if your version of Linux includes the `gdisk` command. Boot to Linux and open a Terminal window. At the prompt, enter the command `gdisk` and report back if the command was found. <comment290343> Hello David, here is it: GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1 my Linux system is Ubuntu 16.04  Thank you so much! <comment290381> Oh my god, problem is solved!!! No word can't describe my feeling right now. Thank you so much. I appreciate your kind help a lots. You rock!
