"The installation failed. The installer could not install the software because there was no software found to install." <body> I'm getting this error on my mid '11 Mac Mini (running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6) when I'm trying to install an audio plug-in by Presonus, the demo of OrangeVocoder 10th Anniversary Edition. The software manufacturer is in Germany and this is just the demo, so I doubt they will be much help. The first thing I tried was downloading a new copy of the DMG file, but it gave the same error when I attempted to install.   I believe the problem is because I had this installed previously, but I recently uninstalled it. After reading this Apple thread I opened the .MPK file (Show Contents) and copied the contents to the desktop and tried to install from there, but got the same error. I also used Terminal and navigated to /private/var/db/receipts and deleted two .plist files that referenced the software. Lastly, I tried this command to disable code-signing check, but it didn't help either: codedefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify -bool true/code     Worth noting that the DMG is not signed (I checked with terminal command codecodesign -dv path\ to\ DMG/code) but the DMG does indeed pass image verification in Disk Utility.   At this point I am out of ideas, but I really need this plug-in for a project I'm working on. Any help greatly appreciated. Thank you.   <answer261405> I found a solution! I was able to install the program by using this shareware: CharlesSoft Pacifist.   <comment327295> can you provide the download link? <comment327328> Thanks, FrontENG. I'm using the older version because that's what all my patches are written for but this is the current one: http://www.zynaptiq.com/orangevocoder/
