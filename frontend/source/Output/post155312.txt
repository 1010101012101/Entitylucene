Yosemite Apple Brown highlight color <body> Is it possible to find the RGB values of the "Apple Brown" highlight color Apple introduced in Yosemite?   <answer155327> Take an screenshot of your screen (kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbd3/kbd) where you can see this colour.  Then with photoshop (pixelmator and others have same option) use a tool called codeEyedropper tool/code. This tool picks the color where you click on the image, and left it as foreground in color picker. Doble click in the color and your have it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aq5E5.png" alt="Eyedropper tool"  <answer155328> #eddeca, or RGB(237, 222, 202)  <answer155329> You can use builtin app called strongDigital Color Meter.app/strong which can be found in code/Applications/Utilities/code. It'll show You strongRGB/strong values. You can copy them as text with kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbdC/kbd.  <comment182688> in what app is that ? <comment182742> Go to System Preferences = General
