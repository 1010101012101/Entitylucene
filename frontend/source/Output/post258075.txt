Unintentional nested list of POSIX paths in Applescript <body> I am trying to pull a list of files with matching extensions from a directory with subfolders, to use in a terminal script.   The list items must be separated by vertical bars "|" to run through the command line app, and I need to remove the first item in the list.  precodeon run     set savedDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "|"     set sourceFolder to choose folder with prompt "Please select directory."     tell application "System Events"         set itemList to (POSIX path of every disk item in folders of sourceFolder whose name extension is "VOB" as string)         log itemList as string     end tell     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to savedDelimiters end run /code/pre  The problem is the resulting list actually a list within a list. Notice the double curly braces in the reply:  precode        get POSIX path of every disk item of every folder of alias "Macintosh HD:Users:USERNAME:Desktop:test2:" whose name extension = "VOB"     --&gt; {{"/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/test2/VIDEO_TS/VIDEO_TS.VOB", "/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/test2/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_0.VOB", "/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/test2/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_1.VOB", "/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/test2/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_2.VOB", "/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/test2/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_3.VOB", "/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/test2/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_4.VOB"}} /code/pre  When I try to work with the list, such as:  precodelog rest of itemList as string /code/pre  It returns an empty string, since the list created has only one item.  Thinking I must be missing something obvious... thanks for taking a look!  <answer258084> Try:  precodeset sourceFolderPath to POSIX path of (choose folder with prompt "Please select directory.") if sourceFolderPath ends with "/" then set sourceFolderPath to text 1 thru -2 of sourceFolderPath set findResultsList to paragraphs of (do shell script "find " &amp; quoted form of sourceFolderPath &amp; " -type f -flags nohidden -iname '*.VOB';") set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {"|"} set findResultsText to findResultsList as text set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {""} return findResultsText /code/pre  <answer258902> I know you have your answer but to stick to pure Applescript, you could have modified your script this way :  precodeon run set savedDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "|" set sourceFolder to choose folder with prompt "Please select directory." tell application "System Events"     set itemList to (POSIX path of every disk item in folders of sourceFolder whose name extension is "mp3" as string)     set newItemList to {}     repeat with n from 1 to count of itemList         if (count of item n of itemList) &gt; 0 then             copy item n of itemList to the end of newItemList         end if     end repeat     log newItemList as string end tell set AppleScript's text item delimiters to savedDelimiters end run /code/pre  <comment322518> If you use `set itemList to (POSIX path of every file of sourceFolder whose name extension is "VOB") as string` and choose the folder that actually contains the .VOB files, does it do what you want? <comment322727> This works. Thanks. <comment322728> Yes. But I'd prefer a method that allows the user to be able to add a directory with subfolders containing the files needed.
