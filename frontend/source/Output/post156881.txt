can I use time machine to restore old icloud confirguration? <body> by  mistake, i accidentally blocked my I cloud account.password, security codes, lost the lot.  Is it possible to use the time machine to come back a few days ago when my passwords were still working?   <answer156884> It's doubtful.  iCloud is locked on the server side, a TM restore would only restore your client side configuration.  <comment184471> "blocked" in what way?
