Using the keyboard to bring up the File, Edit, View... menus <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can I open the menu with keyboard?       In windows, in most applications, if I hit Alt+F it opens the "File" menu.  If it hit Alt+E, it brings up the Edit menu.  Is there an OS X equivalent?  This is a handy way to get to those windows and choose an option without grabbing the mouse.  I know there are keyboard shortcuts for things inside those menus (say Command+C for copy).  But, is there a way to simply bring up the menu so I an see what's in there, then choose my option with arrow keys and return?  <answer30979> You can do this easily; by default, under System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard, an option involving the "f" function keys may be unchecked. If this is the case, check it, and then click the "Keyboard Shortcuts" tab. Go to "Keyboard &amp; Text Input" and find the command for "move focus to the menu bar". Use this command (I believe it's kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF2/kbd or kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdF8/kbd by default). Then, use the kbdF/kbd key for file, the kbdE/kbd key for edit, etc. (or use arrow keys) and hit enter (or down) to show the menu.  <comment372437> this takes me to the top right context (wifi, clock, search, and so on) not the file, edit, view and such context
