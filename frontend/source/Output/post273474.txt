How to get original color balance in Photos? <body> When raw files are imported in Photos, it automatically does some adjustment to color balance. The photographs are shown in the original color first, and then very quickly change to a new balance. How can I prevent or revert that?   <comment343843> Personally, I'd use your camera manufacturer's native app to first open the files, then save the RAW as TIFF before opening in any other app, whether that's Photos or Lightroom, Photoshop... Only the manufacturer actually knows the RAW format for their brand - everyone else is guessing.
