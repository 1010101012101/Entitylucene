Removing current Python version and using another Python version <body> First of all I installed python 2.7 with manual. After I installed Python 2.6 with Macports with referenced this.  And after that I deleted my Python 2.7 files.  The main point is when I type codepython/code at terminal get this:  precode-bash: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python: No such file or directory /code/pre  But if I type the command codepython2.6/code the Python works with all components (like PyQt).  So how can I activate codepython/code command?  <answer86323> I think you probably have two options, barring a reinstallation of 2.7, which might be the easiest thing to do.   You can include the following first line in every Python script:  precode#!/usr/local/bin/python2.6 /code/pre  Change the path to reflect the version and location of the Python you would like to use.  Alternately you could create a bash alias like:  precodealias python = '/path/to/pythonversion' /code/pre  I would go with the first version myself.  <comment99682> Depending on which version of OS X you are running, you may have deleted the system-installed version of python (which looks likely based on the path). Have you considered downloading the latest combo update and re-installing the base system to see if that remedies your issue? http://support.apple.com/downloads/#combo <comment99683> I remove my python version as referenced (http://stackoverflow.com/a/3819829/1149102) this answer. Is it necessary re-installing base system ? <comment99685> There is no bin directory at /usr/local/ , i guess deleted.  But when i write `python2.6 example.py` execute correctly.I may try second option but can you show me what  is my python version path. (I remind that i installed python2.6 with macport.) <comment99687> Thanks everyove. Solved - http://superuser.com/a/225118/209046
