Connecting Apple monitor to Dell latitude E6540 <body> I have an Apple monitor with mini DisplayPort and a Dell laptop E6540 that I want to connect. The Dell provides output for HDMI and VGA, its docking station also provides DVI.  Although I have found adapters for miniDP to DVI or VGA (e.g., to connect a Mac to a projector) I have not been able to find the inverse adapter (DVI, VGA or HDMI to miniDP).   Does someone know where I can find such adapters?  <answer202220> Stepping down from DisplayPort to DVI or VGA is a relatively simple &amp; cheap task.  Unfortunately, going the other way is not so simple... &amp; certainly not so cheap.  I've managed to find these 2 examples of DVI -  DisplayPort adapters, though for the prices you could just about buy a new monitor instead.  I would also be very, very certain that the Apple monitor is, in fact DisplayPort &amp; not Thunderbolt. The connectors look the same &amp; you didn't specify the model in your question.  http://www.startech.com/uk/AV/Converters/Video/DVI-to-DisplayPort-Adapter-with-Audio~DVI2DPA  http://www.amazon.com/AT-DP400-Displayport-Converter-Designed-Convert/dp/B003CWEXWO  <comment243873> Your terminology appears to be partly back-to-front. I've attempted to turn this round for you, but please feel free to re-edit if you feel I got it wrong.
