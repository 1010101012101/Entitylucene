Is there a Mac equivalent for UDEV folder on linux? <body> I am writing a script which should backup my Documents folder onto a USB stick. I want the script to be executed every time I connect the USB stick. I found a solution here. But it seems like I can't find the folder where to put the rule.  So strongdoes anyone know where I could find a udev or rules folder?/strong  <answer46953> udev is Linux specific, so you won't find that in OS X.  You'll need to look for alternative ways of writing your script, e.g. using diskutil.  <answer46954> udev doesn't exist on OS X. As an alternative, you can use the codediskutil activity/code command to continuously monitor disks being mounted or ejected. The codediskutil/code man page says     Continuously display system-wide disk manipulation activity as reported by the Disk Arbitration framework until interrupted with a signal (e.g. by typing Control-C). This can be useful to watch system-wide activity of disks coming on-line or being ejected, volumes on disks being mounted or unmounted, volumes being renamed, etc.    Whilst running the above command and plugging in (then removing) my WD Elements USB drive, I get this output, which could be parsed (even though the man page says not to) to find, say, codeDiskMountApproval/code and codeDiskDisappeared/code to get the volume name and when the disk was added and removed.  precode***DiskPeek ('disk2') Time=20120331-11:56:22.7716 ***DiskPeek ('disk2s1') Time=20120331-11:56:23.0801 ***DiskAppeared ('disk2', DAVolumePath = '&lt;null&gt;', DAVolumeKind = '&lt;null&gt;', DAVolumeName = '&lt;null&gt;') Time=20120331-11:56:23.0810 ***DiskMountApproval ('disk2s1', DAVolumePath = '&lt;null&gt;', DAVolumeKind = 'hfs', DAVolumeName = 'Elements') Comment=Approving Time=20120331-11:56:23.0820 ***DiskAppeared ('disk2s1', DAVolumePath = 'file://localhost/Volumes/Elements/', DAVolumeKind = 'hfs', DAVolumeName = 'Elements') Time=20120331-11:56:23.2574 ***DAIdle (no DADiskRef) Time=20120331-11:56:23.2576 ***DiskUnmountApproval ('disk2s1', DAVolumePath = 'file://localhost/Volumes/Elements/', DAVolumeKind = 'hfs', DAVolumeName = 'Elements') Comment=Approving Time=20120331-11:56:44.2338 ***DiskDescriptionChanged ('disk2s1', DAVolumePath = '&lt;null&gt;') Time=20120331-11:56:44.4515 ***DAIdle (no DADiskRef) Time=20120331-11:56:44.4518 ***DiskEjectApproval ('disk2') Comment=Approving Time=20120331-11:56:44.4542 ***DiskDisappeared ('disk2', DAVolumePath = '&lt;null&gt;', DAVolumeKind = '&lt;null&gt;', DAVolumeName = '&lt;null&gt;') Time=20120331-11:56:50.1964 ***DiskDisappeared ('disk2s1', DAVolumePath = '&lt;null&gt;', DAVolumeKind = 'hfs', DAVolumeName = 'Elements') Time=20120331-11:56:50.1970 ***DAIdle (no DADiskRef) Time=20120331-11:56:50.1972 /code/pre  <comment53744> Thank you :) This is exactly what I need.. <comment53778> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-can-i-run-stop-relaunch-an-application-automatically-at-boot-login-some-oth <comment53849> possible duplicate of [Flash drive autorun script on Mac](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19176/flash-drive-autorun-script-on-mac)
