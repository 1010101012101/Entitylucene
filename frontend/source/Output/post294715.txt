2nd monitor interferes with bandwidth? <body> While using apps such as Zoom or Screenhero, if I have a second monitor connected, then the internet connection gets compromised.  For example, with the 2nd monitor connected, audio throughput becomes dilated, but, after unplugging the 2nd monitor, audio throughput is stable.  Specifically:    ol liI am using a mid-2012 AirBook with a 2GHz i7, 8GB RAM and a SSD./li liI am connecting through the ThunderBolt port to a ThunderBolt/HMDI converter, then to an HDMI monitor./li liI am using an Oracle wireless router with a basic TWC ISP package (3-5MB/s)./li liWith an active Zoom meeting in progress, Google's internet speed test reports: 26.2Mbps download &amp; 5.92Mbps upload./li /ol  Why does the connection of a 2nd monitor have emany/em impact at all on the streaming throughput? I am otherwise able to stream HD movies to the 2nd monitor from sites like HBOGO and YouTube.  Is it, perhaps, a bad idea to unplug and plug in the 2nd monitor while the OS is running? (i.e. should I shut down when I need to plug it in or disconnect it?)  <comment372401> Is this by chance an LG Ultrafine 5K? These cause awful interference with wifi when in use. It's a known issue and really the only solution is to return it <comment372470> No, Samsung series 4, no wifi/air play/"smartTV"
