Photos disappeared from Photos app on all devices without deleting them. <body> Recently went travelling and due to full storage on iPhone was uploading frequently to MacBook. The issue that has been discussed a lot where photos couldn't be deleted from the iPhone without importing occurred so ended up with doubled up photos from phone and iCloud on MacBook. Went through and deleted double ups on MacBook manually. Was very careful in doing this to not mistakenly delete the wrong photos!  Now unfortunately a week later, some photos are now missing from all devices when they haven't been deleted from the MacBook (or MacMini). They may have been deleted from the phone individually.   Just wondering how that could affect them being saved on the MacBook when they were imported and if there is any option of recovery? I have tried the show recently deleted photos option and there is nothing recently deleted (even though it is less than 30 days)!  Any insight would be much appreciated. Thanks!
