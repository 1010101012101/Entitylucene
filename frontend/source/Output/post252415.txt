How can I connect my old iMac to two other monitors? <body> I have 2 monitors, and a 2010 iMac, which has only one display port input.  My first monitor has got HDMI output, and my second has VGA output. I already have my HDMI monitor connected via a HDMI-display port adapter. How can I link up my third monitor (not as mirror, but all separate). Surely there is a fairly cheap solution?  <comment314056> This is quite close to being a duplicate, but I am hesitant to flag it as such just yet.  In any event, check out this post [Connect MacBook Pro to two external monitors](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/195215/connect-macbook-pro-to-two-external-monitors/195224#195224).  The only difference in the questions is yours is about an iMac and the other a MacBook.  The answer is identical, however. <comment314060> I am pretty sure the difference is crucial, as mac book pro has more than one display input? may be wrong...thank you for the link. <comment314062> Depends on the MacBook, but the answer is still the same - [USB to DVI/HDMI/VGA](http://amzn.to/2caeH0P) <comment314069> I already bought this https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01CNF0U0E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it turned out you can only use one at a time <comment314071> and that other one has the same problem. I fear this is a rather dark issue - as i have tried many things! <comment314079> I don't think it's possible... but... could you please correct your terminology for 'input' & 'output'. It's totally confusing the way you've written it. Signals go from an output to an input. Cable adapters also go 'from...to'.
