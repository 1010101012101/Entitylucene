Set the screen saver to 20 minutes <body> I set 20 minutes in System Preferences - Desktop &amp; Screen Saver, however the screen saver starts after 5 minutes. I tried to log out and restart the mac with no success.  I should say that after restarting I can see 5 minutes again. So it looks like the settings were not saved.  <answer93388> Check the date for the file: com.apple.screensaver.50A10F0D-581E-5D09-8966-646EE8532C5B.plist in Libary  after you made the time change, it should show the latest date/time.  If not, delete the file.  <comment109551> what OS are you running on what hardware? <comment109566> Yes, it is the latest time when I update the settings. But still the problem perseveres as I have not changed anything in my system. <comment109574> So, it saves your settings! Do you have another program running for screensaver? <comment109587> I also found another file called com.apple.screensaver.plist in ~/Library/Preferences and this one does not change. Can I convince the system to use the file that changes? <comment109588> I created a symbolic link and will if it works: `ln ./Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.4002120C-60DA-5800-8B83-F4DF0377E8B6.plist ./Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist` <comment109847> No, that experiment did not work. What else could I do? <comment159647> It is possible your ACLs need to be reset. First use disk utility to reset systems, then use the cmd-r reset password for your user account, but do NOT reset it!!, instead use reset users ACL.
