Multiple Display Issues with MBP <body> I've been having some annoying issues since getting my second display, and was hoping someone could give me some tips as to how I can improve things.  ol liIf I take the computer out of sleep before the monitor it increases the MBP Display's resolution and moves all my windows to that screen. Then once my monitor turns on, all windows are brought back to the appropriate display, but are now shoved into the corner and much smaller./li liWhen I turn the monitor on before taking the computer out of sleep, the windows will all be moved down an inch from the top of the display./li /ol  If anyone can shed some light on these issues I would be very appreciative.  EDIT: I am using the latest version of Mac OS X, with the monitor connected via MiniDisplayport to my Dell U2913WM Monitor.  <comment244184> Please provide some more information like OS X version, display, type of connection (Thinderbolt?), etc. <comment244186> Thanks @n1000, I added the relevant info.
