What app is making my phone vibrate, without putting a corresponding notification up? <body> There is an app I can't locate that is constantly making my phone vibrate. When it does, I immediately check the Notification Center. Nothing new there.  The vibrate could be a setting for an email application, or some other app.   One thing to note, I always have my app on silent/vibrate.  I just unmuted it in the hopes that the sound will help me figure out what is going on.   strongQuestion/strong  How can I determine which app is sending rogue vibrations without any notification?   <answer280082> You may need to go through strongSettings/strong â†’ strongNotifications/strong and check which apps have an strongAlert Style/strong of emNone/em and strongShow in Notification Center/strong emdisabled/em, but strongSound/strong toggled emon/em.  <comment352248> I have LOTS of apps.  Very painstaking to do... <comment352270> Email is my guess. The default settings for that over time have evolved.  I had this problem too, email was the answer.
