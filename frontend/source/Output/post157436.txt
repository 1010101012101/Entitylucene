Suddenly all my files have a null kMDItemDateAdded (Date Added) field <body> Almost all my files now have a null kMDItemDateAdded field:  precode$ mdls -name kMDItemFSName -name kMDItemDateAdded 2014-01-14-1500595479_04-EVN.PDF kMDItemDateAdded = (null) kMDItemFSName    = "2014-01-14-1500595479_04-EVN.PDF" /code/pre  How could it happen? What do I need to do to restore it?  <answer191514> I don't think its a bug. An update in Apples mdimport schema will cause this. I checked this file /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework/Resources/MetadataSchema.xsd on OSX 10.6.8 and OSX 10.9 and found codekMDItemDateAdded/code only in code10.9/code.  When your mdworker will update your existing Meta Data using the new schema, it will fill codekMDItemDateAdded/code with codenull/code, because codePDF.mdimporter/code is not taking care of this attribute. How should the pdf know, when it is added?  If your codemds/code is consuming lots of CPU time ou should re-index your Spotlight Database like mentioned here  <comment185686> This seems to be a Yosemite bug, I've had iCloud files revert to 2001 because of this. Did you install 10.10.1? <comment185689> I'm still on 10.10. Do you think 10.10.1 would fix it? <comment185690> Suddenly I realized that I have tried turning off spotlight like mentioned here [http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/144474/mds-and-mds-stores-constantly-consuming-cpu] and may be I have turned it back on only after couple of days. <comment185691> I think so, I haven't seen the iCloud issue after the update. The bug is actually in Finder on the MAC. I think it happen system wide but I never noticed it until I opened something from iCloud, I have "sort by date added" on that and every time I opened a file it went back to 2001.
