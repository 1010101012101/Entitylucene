iPad tries to connect to Apple TV but then gives up <body> I am trying to set up my Apple TV and running into some difficulties.  I can see the mirroring option on the iPad, and when I select it I can see my Apple TV.  When I select these options it nothing happens. It looks like it's thinking about it for a second, then it just pops back to "iPad" â€” there is no error message.  I've updated the Apple TV. Checked the network type (802.11n). I know the TV is on the network as I can get at YouTube.  Any suggestions?
