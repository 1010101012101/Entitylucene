Moving or creating Recovery Disk with dual internal SDD with RAID <body> I have removed my DVD player and installed a second SSD in its place. Partitioned first SSD to hold OS X Sierra. The other partition was RAID0 with second SSD. I seem to have my Recovery HD on disk1 instead of disk0. This causes my Recovery HD not to show up when the option key is pressed prior to startup. YES, it is the option key for my 2010 Macbook, not command + R or option+R or anything else. This is verified. All that appears with option is the standard Mac_OS  Here is my map with diskutil list  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eB4oN.png" alt="list"  But as you can see from my image above, trying to use these solutions failed. He is another screen shot showing that the answer of this forum failed. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKD8V.png" alt="failed answered"  I would like to be able to use my Recovery HD because I need to change csrutil, which is not available for me to change via Internet Recovery nor Bootable USB.  Why I want to change csrutil? So that I can modify my DVDPlayback file to read the DVD player I removed from the Mac, that is in a USB case. The DVD drive that was replaced with the SSD.  <comment341313> Things tried: (can't post more than 2 links so hardcoding)  "https://www.lifewire.com/create-os-x-recovery-hd-on-any-drive-2260909" "http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/217964/how-to-change-the-recovery-hd-partition-to-type-apple-boot?newreg=96b4b41732c143c4aaf1549d3caed81b"
