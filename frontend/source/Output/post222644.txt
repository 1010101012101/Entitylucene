Install older version of VirtualBox (4.3.6-91406) on OS X El Capitan <body> I am trying to install VirtualBox 4.3.6-91406 on OS X El Capitan because I want to run an old version of Minix.  It is advised to run my version of Minix on VirtualBox 4.3.6 as it may not be compatible with the newest VirtualBox 5.0.12-104815 and anything between.  h2Running the old VirtualBox 4.3.6-91406:/h2  This is what I get when I try to install VirtualBox 4.3.6-91406:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vdMa4.png" alt="The installation failed."  h2Running latest VirtualBox 5.0.12-104815:/h2  And this is what I get when I try to run my old version of Minix on the latest VirtualBox:     Implementation of the USB 2.0 controller not found!
