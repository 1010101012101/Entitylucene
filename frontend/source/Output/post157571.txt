MAMP Pro license record <body> I purchased a license for MAMP Pro and copy/pasted the license on the webpage when I ordered it.  But there is no record of the license key on the invoice or on when I login to their support system..  I am retiring this computer and transferring my work to a new computer so I am trying to find my license so I can reinstall MAMP on the new computer.  I've looked through the ~/Library/Application Support folder and /Applications/MAMP Pro/ but I can not find it in a plist file either.  Does anyone know where this is stored or where I can find it?  I've already submitted a support ticket but figured I'd see if someone knows rather than waiting around for them to get back to me.  <answer157691> The MAMP Pro 1.0/2.0/2.0 upgrade/3.0 serial numbers are stored in the following files:br code"/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/Registration 1.0"/code or code"/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/Registration 2.0"/code or code"/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/Registration upgrade 1.0 to 2.0"/code or code"/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/Registration 3.0"/code  Example:    precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;sn&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;AABB1122CCDD33AA1&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Your serial number is then codestring/code : AABB-1122-CCDD-33AA1  <answer280231> ul ligo to https://www.mamp.info/en/forgotSerial.php/li lienter your e-mail /li liMAMP sent all your earlier purchases that were done with that particular e-mail/li /ul  <comment185301> I typically resort to my email to find it. <comment185302> It wasn't in the invoice. <comment185309> If I recall correctly, it typically comes shortly after the invoice.
