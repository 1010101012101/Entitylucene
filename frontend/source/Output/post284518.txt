How to permanently block all incoming connections in the macOS firewall? <body> I have the default macOS firewall enabled with stealth mode and block all incoming connections option set. And I have it locked. But after a while, the firewall is in green state with selective blocking and not block all connections.   How to identify which application is changing the firewall state? I have another admin user in my system, but I have remote login option disabled. I think this user is responsible for system change. I have removed that account meanwhile, but still want to know how to identify firewall state changes.   Is it possible to get an alert or something when the state changes?  Edit: It is not related to the admin account. After removing it, still this senario happens.  Figured. It is the policy applied. JAMF.  <answer285905> You might want to install Little Snitch, a tool that helps you to identify and control any incoming and outgoing traffic and what it was initiated from.  Note that I assume it is not advisable to completely block emany/em incoming traffic.  <comment367661> Please don't post a possible answer (JAMF policy) in your question. Instead write a proper answer with some details/some explanation...
