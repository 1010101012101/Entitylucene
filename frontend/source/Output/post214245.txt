Macbook booting up in Recovery Partition by default after dual-SSD/HDD <body> I've installed a SSD, and cloned my earlier HDD OS X to it using Carbon Copy Cloner.br Now, whenever I boot-up, the MBP by default boots to recovery partition. How do I correct this? How do I ensure it boots up to the newly installed SSD by default?  I'm able to login to OS on SSD by pressing alt/option while starting the laptop. The 'startup disk' in settings doesn't show any other startup disks. The boot-options screen shows me 3 options: SSD - Recovery Partition - Recovery Partition. (1 recovery parition each on SSD and HDD).  I'd installed the SSD in the optical bay, kept HDD in the original bay (as I read ~ only the main bay has shock sensors). After cloning over the OS X, I deleting all OS X related files from the HDD. I am on El Capitan.  output from idiskutil list/i below.  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1 2:                  Apple_HFS macSSD                  119.0 GB   disk0s2 3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, physical): #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1 2:                  Apple_HFS macHD                   459.0 GB   disk1s2 3:                 Apple_Boot                         650.0 MB   disk1s3 4:       Microsoft Basic Data bootcamp                40.2 GB    disk1s4 /code/pre
