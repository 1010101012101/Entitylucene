Where is the bluetooth antenna located in iPhones? <body> I posted this question on the Apple support forum, but no one could give me an answer.  I am researching iBeacons for my final year project at University and I'm interested to know the position of the Bluetooth antenna in the iPhones.  Can anybody give me a reliable source explaining where the bluetooth antenna is located on the different versions of the iPhones? iPhone 4S up to 6 plus.  Cheers.  <answer170749> There are teardown/repair guides at iFixIt, they note where the chips and antennas are located.  For example, in an iPhone 4S teardown, here's a photo of the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip.br There is a guide on replacing the upper antenna - which is the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth one.br And there is also a step-by-step guide on fixing the wi-fi which provides the detailed photos and description.  It appears that the Bluetooth antenna is located at the top of the 4S. The discussion of the iPhone 6 teardown also states that the Apple fit the antenna on the top.   So, iFixit has a lot of manuals and photos to provide. Also, they've got a great community, so if you have any further questions, you can ask them instead.  <answer228753> Its on the top as when you block that area of the phone the bluetooth stops working  <comment200818> Hi Igor, thanks for the quick response! Yes I came across them before, but I was hoping for a more reliable source such as Apple. I assume they don't release it though :/ <comment200819> @smj2393 sadly, Apple is a pretty much _private_ company in that case. :( <comment200821> Ok cheers, guess I will have to use iFixIt then!
