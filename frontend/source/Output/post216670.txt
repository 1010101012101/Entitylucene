Beachball on external hardrive <body> I have my LaCie external drive running snowleopard because I'm still using Appleworks. Everything has been working great for 10 months. After upgrading to Yosemite whenever I started up with LaCie, I would open Appleworks to do a document or enter new stuff into my database or spreadsheet and the beachball would appear and would not leave. I could not force quit any application. Safari or Firefox would not open and I would do a force shutdown. I took it to an Apple affiliated shop, explained the whole problem and after 2 days they said it worked fine starting up with Lacie. I bring it home and the beachball appears almost immediately. I take it back and they call me the same day and says it's working fine. Same story when I bring it home. HELP!!!
