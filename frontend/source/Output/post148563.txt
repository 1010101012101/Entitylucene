Merging multiple AIFF files from the command line <body> Is there a way to put multiple commands in different voices into the same audio file. I know you can do this:  precodesay -v "Cellos" "la di da" -o ex.aiff /code/pre  But I have multiple commands in different voices such as:  precodesay -v "Cellos" "la di da" say -v "Bells" "di da da" /code/pre  Is there a way to  have codesay/code put multiple phrases using different settings in to the same aiff or mp3 file? (If not, can I merge the individual files programmatically using terminal tools and commands?  <answer148566> You can use FFmpeg. Create a file named codeinput.txt/code with the contents (one line for each file):  precodefile 'ex.aiff' file 'ex2.aiff' /code/pre  Then run codeffmpeg -f concat -i input.txt -c copy output.aiff/code.  <answer148657>  Using codesox/code:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesox 1.aif 2.aif output.aif /code/pre  Using codeffmpeg/code:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeffmpeg -f concat -i &lt;(printf %s\\n "file '$PWD/"{1,2}.aif\') -c copy output.aif /code/pre  <comment326806> I found that quotes were not accepted in `input.txt`, instead, spaces had to be escaped with a backslash. Also, I had to add `-safe 0` to the options of `ffmpeg`.
