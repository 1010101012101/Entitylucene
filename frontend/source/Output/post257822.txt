Can't boot Windows 10 after it with Boot Camp <body> I have a new MacBook Pro 13 2015 edition, 128GB. I tried to install Windows 10 with Boot Camp. I sticked a 4GB USB flash drive with Windows 10 iso file. I follow instructions in Boot Camp, giving Windows 37GB disk space.  After the install, my MacBook restarted, I can see that now I have 75GB for OSX, but I can't see Windows anywhere. I tried following these steps: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204417 but neither worked as if there was no Windows installed, but the space I gave it is unavailable.  Can I boot the Windows installation somehow? If not, how can retrieve my disk space for OSX?  <comment322318> It would be hard to post an answer without knowing the content of the partition tables. Update you question with the output from these Terminal application commands: `diskutil list`, `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`. These commands will not change your computer.
