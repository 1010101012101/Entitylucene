How can I get the Facebook iPhone app to stop asking me if I would like to enable push notifications? <body> I know how to configure notifications and have all of them disabled for everything except the Phone, Reminders, Calendar and Messages because whatever I am doing at the moment is ALWAYS more important than anything that any of the other apps on my phone might want to notify me about, be it with a push notification, in the notification center, a banner notification or, even, a badge.  I don't want any of that for anything but the four apps listed above.  Unfortunately, the Facebook app asks me if I would like to enable push notifications quite regularly.  As my 9-year old sons says, "No means no!".  Is there some way to persuade the Facebook app that I really, REALLY do not want to enable push notifications and WILL NEVER, EVER change my mind about that?  For bonus points, can I get the Game Center app to never, ever, under any circumstances, log me in to the Game Center?  Like, ever :-)  <comment111949> We prefer the one (1) question at the time since that allows search engines (including Google) to find it (and the associated answers) ! <comment111950> http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/iOS+6/feature.asp?c=47769 <comment112235> Thanks for the response Buscar!  The second question was more of a joke as I am sure it is impossible.  Upon reflection, I think my original question is really a Facebook App question, not an iOS question.  Facebook has decided there app should bug me about enable push notifications periodically if I have not allowed.  This was a poor design choice on there part.  If an app asks if it can bug me and I say "no thanks", the app should NOT continue to ask for permission to bug me!
