I think some Sierra OS update make this change but I am not sure about this. I try to find the solution online, follow some steps and download some font but nothing still works.   If anyone has faced this kind of problem and solve I will like tp try that solution. Thanks for your time.  <comment333859> Try going to Applications  Font Book and doing File  Restore Standard Fonts and restarting. <comment333931> @TomGewecke Thanks.
