export photos from iphone4s using itunes without icloud <body> How can I export photos from iphone4s using itunes without icloud? I need this feature because I'm using Windows XP and I don't want to jailbreak.  <answer54606> I don't connect my iPhone to my WinXP box, but a bit of Googling returned this instructional which shows how to get the result you are looking for using XP's built-in "Scanner and Camera Wizard".   <comment62538> so i cannot do that via itunes, right? <comment62544> Even on a Mac, photo exports to a computer are not done with iTunes. <comment62545> I also use Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/) on my iPhone and computers (Win and Mac).  The current version will sync photos to your dropbox folder.  If you have that feature enabled *and* you have the dropbox application installed on your Windows machine, it automagically pull down your photos. <comment62546> That's a good idea! I didn't know about that feature before. But unfortunately, it is not applicable to my friends in China since Dropbox is not accessible there. Thanks a lot anyways! <comment62547> Looks like the photo import capability of XP is the way to go then.
