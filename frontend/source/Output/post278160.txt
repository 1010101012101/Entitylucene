Issues setting up ncurses C/C++ library on OS X <body> I recently downloaded ncurses from here and have compiled it using code./configure and make/code  As it is recommended in the README, I compiled the example programs that come bundled with the package. The programs compiled without any issue, but every time I run the programs I get the following errors:  codeTerminal type "xterm-256color" terminals database is inaccessible/code  Changing the terminal's type using codeTERM=xterm/code and codeexport TERM/code don't seem to solve this issue, and I'm just stuck. Will ncurses work if I included them in my C/C++ programs, or should I make sure the examples work?
