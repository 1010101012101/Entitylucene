How do you convert video within 10.7 without any 3rd party software <body> Is it possible to convert video resolution within 10.7 without the use of Handbrake.app or other 3rd party software? I'm not allowed to install any apps on this machine so hence not being able to download Handbrake.app  <answer21738> Yes it's possible, just right click on the video file within finder and choose the encode selected video files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0m2m.png" alt="Right click on video file" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TFvuu.png" alt="Choose resolution" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2TPh6.png" alt="click continue"  <comment23897> Very nice find!
