Reminders & iCloud sync <body> I am using iCloud and Reminders and since a couple of weeks I am seeing a strange behaviour:  ul linew events are correctly added to all the devices/li lievents marked as "done" are not marked on other devices (none of them)/li /ul  I am using several Yosemite and iOS devices. Both behaviours are the same independently from the device.  strongUpdate/strong  The events are marked as "done" in iCloud (checked with a browser), this means that synchronising from a device (iOS or OS X) to iCloud works. In the other direction, i.e., from iCloud to devices it does not.  <comment225399> I can't reproduce de problem on OS X 10.10.3 / iOS 8.3; are those standard reminders? Do they repeat, have alarms, geofences? <comment225401> Both standard and repeating. All with an alarm. <comment225404> Tried to reproduce with alarm, and creating reminder from OS X / iOS; it works fine here, sorry.
