Using quotes in SublimeText build system command <body> I'd like to execute a simple AppleScript command as part of a Sublime Text build system. I created a codesublime-build/code file where the command is  precode"cmd": ["osascript", "-e", """tell application "Preview" to activate"""] /code/pre  but I can't seem to escape the quotes properly. I've tried using code\"/code, code\'/code, and a few other combinations, with no luck. Does anyone know what the proper syntax is? In the shell, I simply write  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Preview" to activate' /code/pre  Thanks!  <answer120067> Apologies, I got it. The solution is simple and I must have missed it:  precode"cmd": ["osascript", "-e", "tell application \"Preview\" to activate"] /code/pre
