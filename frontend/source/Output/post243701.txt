How to find the Apple Service Part number for Macbook Pro Retina Display "clamshell"? <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) that has a broken screen and I need to replace it.  The online sellers post the "Apple Service Part" number as one of the identifiers to determine if it will fit the Macbook, but I have no idea where to find the Apple Service Part number for the display.  In one of the sites, the service part number is listed as:     Apple service part: 661-7171 and 661-7032   Is there a way for me to find out what the part number is?    Many thanks!
