How are paths to files and folders constructed in OS X? <body> I need to indicate a right file path to read a code.csv/code file into R on OS X, but how can I find where the file is stored? Looking at Excel files, the file path starts at codeusers/â€¦/code, but there is no indication of a disk or something.  <answer127899> strongThere's no disk letter in OS X unlike Windows./strong  The mount point for disks is usually /Volumes. For example, files on a flash drive with the name codeFLASHDRIVE/code will be located in code/Volumes/FLASHDRIVE//code.  The startup disk is the root, code//code. Therefore, the Users folder is code/Users/code. No drive letter is prepended to this.  <answer127908> You can right click the file and "Get Info". The path is written right there. Alternatively you could e.g. drag the file into a terminal window to see the path..
