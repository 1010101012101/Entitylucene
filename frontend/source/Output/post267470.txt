App Store says password is wrong but it is not <body> I need to update an app and when I try, it tells me to sign into my iTunes store account. When I try it tells me my password is wrong. On the Apple site my password is correct and I can log in fine.   I have this problem almost every time I update apps. Is there anything I can do, other than changing my password again?  <comment335644> & you're certain the apple ID is the correct one for the app? If at any point another ID was used for a purchase, that ID will need to be used again for any updates.
