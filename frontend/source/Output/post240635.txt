Installed new SSD now when my mac dies to freezes on restart <body> I've installed a new SSD not an OEM, but it's a compatible fit to my early macbook pro 2015 with retina 13". When my battery dies it doesnt hibernate my mac, so when I restart it, it freezes and then I have to hold the power button to force it to turn off. When it does boot, I get the following report. I've no idea how to read this so any help would be appreciated.   precodeAnonymous UUID:       27082FFD-D0D3-F92A-D827-BEC6D1920688  Sat Jun  4 11:51:29 2016  *** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff800e59b0d4): launchd exited (signal 10, exit status 0 )  uuid info:  0x7fff609ea000 uuid = &lt;a468d85e-d8d6-3461-8c99-49d3b9acfc63&gt;  0x105597000    uuid = &lt;48362449-4519-317e-9a8b-7524036de5ea&gt;  Thread 1 crashed  RAX: 0xffffffffffffffff, RBX: 0x00007fff860081b8, RCX: 0x00007fff899fd3aa, RDX: 0xffffffffffffffff RSP: 0x0000700000116e28, RBP: 0x0000700000116e40, RSI: 0x0000000000000000, RDI: 0x00007fff860081b8 R8:  0x0000000000000000, R9:  0x0000000000000000, R10: 0x00007fff899fd3aa, R11: 0x0000000000000207 R12: 0x00007fff719fd180, R13: 0x00007fff719fd1c0, R14: 0x00007fff719fd1b8, R15: 0x0000000000000000 RFL: 0x0000000000010206, RIP: 0x00007fff8600766a, CS:  0x000000000000002b, SS:  0x0000000000000023  Thread 0: 0xffffff8020b9c920     0x00000001055c114b     0x00007fff943f052a     0x0000000000000000     0x00007fff85fec665     0x00007fff85fec64e     0x00007fff85fe90b5     0x00007fff85fe8dcd     0x0000000000000000  Thread 1: 0xffffff8020b9cdb0     0x00007fff85ff77b5     0x0000000000000000  Thread 2: 0xffffff8020b9d240     0x00000001055ae529     0x00007fff85fe340b     0x00007fff85fe803b     0x00007fff85fee707     0x00007fff85fe340b     0x00007fff85fe729b     0x00007fff85fe6b00     0x00007fff82fa54de     0x00007fff82fa3341     0x0000000000000000  Thread 3: 0xffffff8021ac2db0     0x00007fff83324605     0x00007fff833245a8     0x00007fff82fa73dc     0x00007fff82fa6f63     0x00007fff82fa5582     0x00007fff82fa3341     0x0000000000000000  Thread 4: 0xffffff8020ccbb60     0x00007fff82fa3341     0x0000000000000000  Mac OS version: 15F34 Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 15.5.0: Tue Apr 19 18:36:36 PDT 2016; root:xnu-3248.50.21~8/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: 7E7B0822-D2DE-3B39-A7A5-77B40A668BC6 System model name: MacBookPro12,1 (Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6) Model: MacBookPro12,1, BootROM MBP121.0167.B16, 2 processors, Intel Core i5, 2.7 GHz, 8 GB, SMC 2.28f7 Graphics: Intel Iris Graphics 6100, Intel Iris Graphics 6100, Built-In Memory Module: BANK 0/DIMM0, 4 GB, DDR3, 1867 MHz, 0x80AD, 0x483943434E4E4E424C54414C41522D4E5544 Memory Module: BANK 1/DIMM0, 4 GB, DDR3, 1867 MHz, 0x80AD, 0x483943434E4E4E424C54414C41522D4E5544 AirPort: spairport_wireless_card_type_airport_extreme (0x14E4, 0x133), Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (7.21.95.175.1a6) Bluetooth: Version 4.4.5f3 17904, 3 services, 27 devices, 1 incoming serial ports Network Service: Wi-Fi, AirPort, en0 Serial ATA Device: OWC Aura SSD, 479.95 GB Serial ATA Device: MARVELL VIRTUAL USB Device: USB 3.0 Bus USB Device: Card Reader USB Device: Bluetooth USB Host Controller Thunderbolt Bus: MacBook Pro, Apple Inc., 27.1 /code/pre  <comment295828> The 2015 (Early/Mid) MBP uses a **proprietary** SSD; OWC is the only company I know of that makes "compatible" SSDs.  That said, did you do a restore or a clean installation?  I always prefer to do a clean install. <comment295834> That's who I used OWC and I've confirmed with their technical support that I'm using a compatible SSD. I did a clean install. I've aso reset the PRAM and SMC, but not change. <comment295835> My mac functions fine in general usage, but as soon as the battery dies it doesn't restart properly. <comment295836> Does OS X warn you that the battery is  going to die? <comment295842> No I haven't had any warning like that, and the problem has only occurred since the upgrade. Does the log above indicate anything do you know? <comment295844> I've found my sleep settings too:  Jonathans-MBP:vm jonathanlockley$ pmset -g Active Profiles: Battery Power  1* AC Power  2 Currently in use:  standbydelay         10800  standby              0  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  gpuswitch            2  powernap             0  disksleep            10  sleep                1 (sleep prevented by iTunes, coreaudiod)  autopoweroffdelay    14400  hibernatemode        3  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         2  acwake               0  lidwake              1 <comment295845> That could be a coincidence that it happened after the upgrade.  "exit status 0 " means a normal (no error) exit.  I don't know what "signal 10" is in this context, but I can tell you that the "signal" sent by another process telling launchd to exit was what caused it to exit.  Put back the old SSD and see if the problem persists.
