Top row of keyboard isn't working <body> I just turned on my Macbook air this morning and now the top keys aren't doing anything (F1, F2, etc). I can't turn down my keyboard light or anything. I tried going to system preferences and checking "Use all F1, F2, etc keys.." option but I am still not able to do anything like turn down volume or anything. I am using OS X Yosemite Version 10.10.1 .  <answer166326> This happened to me a while back... First, try just holding down the power button for 10 seconds, to force the MacBook to shut down, and then reboot it normally. That sometimes works.    Failing that, you could try resetting the SMC:  strongResetting the SMC on portables with a battery you should not remove on your own/strong  Note: Portable computers that have a battery you should not remove on your own include MacBook Pro (Early 2009) and later, all models of MacBook Air, and MacBook (Late 2009).  ol liShut down the computer./li liPlug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected./li liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time./li liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li liPress the power button to turn on the computer.

After spending about an hour with Apple help, we tried the System Preferences box, resetting SMC and PRAM, re-installed the OS, and nothing worked. I took it back to the Genius Bar and they quickly diagnosed the problem: the tech who repaired the trackpad forgot to re-map the keyboard out of the universal factory setting to US English, which is a necessary step.   It took about 15 minutes and then I was on my way.   Hope this helps!   <answer259553> I had the same problem and it got fixed once I installed Karabiner-Elements and opened it.
