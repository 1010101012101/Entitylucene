icons not bouncing at all when I open them <body> I was forced to do a fresh install of El Cap. Now when I click on an app to open it, it will not bounce, not even once to acknowledge that the app is opening.   How do I solve that?  <answer218816> You need to select codeAnimate opening Applications/code option from Dock codePreferences/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qJE6U.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment264543> THANKS!
