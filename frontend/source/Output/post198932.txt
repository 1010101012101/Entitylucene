Device or computer could not be verified <body> Recently I bought Macbook Pro Retina Early 2015, and after approximately one month my wifi shows      No Wifi/Wireless device found   I rush to the iStore and submitted my macbook, they serviced it and returned it to me, after approximately 2 to 3 days the problem was back again and gone after 2 days. Since my wifi is working perfectly.   The problem I am facing is now when I open APP STORE and sign in there I get the following error message:     Your device or computer could not be verified. Contact support for assistance.   I googled it search it on forums and got that its an issue of non registered network adapter. Kindly help me in this scenario is this a software bug or a hardware one or some effective solution.  <answer200666> I would try re-installing OS X to fix this.  To re-install OS X without losing files and without a DVD try these steps:  ol liShutdown computer./li liStart up computer while holding the Command, Option, and R keys until you see a globe icon appear on the screen like this one. emThis may take a while, be patient./em/li liWhen a screen like this appears, select "Reinstall OS X". Follow along with the instructions and in 1-2 hours you will have a new copy of OS X with all of your files and apps intact./li /ol  If the App Store works after re-installation, then please click the check-mark next to my post to mark it as the accepted answer.  One of the awesome things about OS X is that you can re-install pretty easily without losing anything, some problems when you can't get them to go away can be fixed by re-installing. Remember these steps for later :)  <answer229168> Just had this problem. Not sure what exactly had helped, but I  ul liWent to the Network Preferences and deleted whatever I could, all the locations except the one left and for this last deleted all the interfaces./li liRebooted/li liIn the Network Preferences created a new location./li /ul  After that everything started to work again. Probably you could just delete and recreate your Ethernet interface.  <answer258484> Happened same with me. This is happening because the App Store is looking for a working connection on en0 port and it is not getting anything anything on it due to which it says the device cannot be verified.  ul liYour task is to switch the en0 and en1 assignments basically./li liJust copy the files 'preferences.plist' and 'NetworkInterfaces.plist' from code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code to Desktop as a backup and delete it from code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code/li liRestart your Mac and try to login into the App Store/li /ul  Worked for me!  <comment241849> Better read the described question. This doesn't look like the best suited answer to a typical hardware problem. Don't you think this full Mac OS X reinstall will just be a waste of time for our colleague already in trouble with a broken connection ?
