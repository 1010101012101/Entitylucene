Disable boot from CD/DVD <body> Is there a way to disable the boot from CD/DVD? I don't want to disable it permanently, just when it automatically checks on boot for the presence of a CD/DVD.  <comment80245> I would assume that the answer [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/56335/how-to-set-up-an-imac-not-to-look-for-usb-flash-drive-info-during-boot-up) is applicable in this case <comment81544> @ethanlee16 thanks!
