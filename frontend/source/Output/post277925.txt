Is it possible to use iPhone as a proxy server? <body> I'm in China and I'm using an VPN app to access YouTube/Google/Facebook. I want to access YouTube/Google/Facebook on my laptop, but the app can't be used on my laptop.  I tried tethering on iPhone, but it doesn't work.  Are there any apps which can make my iPhone as an proxy for my laptop?  <answer277981> You can add a VPN in your iPhone's settings, then use your iPhone as a hotspot for your laptop computer. Provided the VPN is configured to route all traffic through it, this will also route your laptop's traffic though the VPN.  How exactly you can setup a VPN depends on the specific VPN your are using.  <comment349758> is your iPhone jailbroken ? if so you can use openssh on the iphone to set SOCKS proxy
