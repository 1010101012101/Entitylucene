Restore incomplete iCloud backup <body> One month ago i lost my iPhone 5. Got a new one, 6S, and i'm trying to recover my old media. According to iCloud, there is a 1.5 GB Incomplete backup from the phone which is now gone. Is there anything I can do to salvage any of the data from this Incomplete 1.5 GB backup?Thanks in advance!  <answer229914> Your iCloud backups should be stored in:br code/Users/[user name]/Library/Application\ Support/MobileSync/Backup/code  You can use a backup extraction tool like this one (note that the free version is limited) to see what you can get from the backup, then transfer it to your phone via iTunes.
