44.1 kHz vs 48 kHz in Audio MIDI Setup? <body> In the macOS utility application emAudio MIDI Setup/em, it's possible to select various Float and Integer options for audio input and outputs.  I'm curious to what the effect would be of switching to 48 kHz output, from 44.1 kHz which seems to be the system default at 24-bit.  Could I expect this to cause problems with certain applications and so forth?  From what I know, 48 kHz is supposedly somewhat better audio quality, but the difference may not be really audible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jqmCx.png" alt="enter image description here"
