Custom screen resolution for a VirtualBox Mac guest? <body> strongTL;DR/strong - emHow do I set a custom screen resolution for a VirtualBox Mac guest?/em  I'm in a situation where I need to keep Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6.8) alive in a VirtualBox setup to run some legacy software. The host machine is a 2013 MacBook Retina 13" running El Capitan (Mac OS X 10.11) Honestly, things are running pretty well... better than expected! The one irritation is that I can't set the resolution to something reasonable.   I've scoured the internet and followed lots of tutorials. The only thing that has been effective, has been this:     To control GOP, use the following VBoxManage command:      VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" VBoxInternal2/EfiGopMode N      Where N can be one of 0,1,2,3,4 referring to the 640x480, 800x600,   1024x768, 1280x1024, 1440x900 screen resolution respectively.   While this is useful, I need a custom resolution of 1440x856... which will allow me to put the VM on a 1440x900 display with VirtualBox's top and bottom utility bars exposed without having to scroll the window around.  Is there a way to set a custom screen resolution for a Mac host and guest in VirtualBox?
