Can I use my iPad as a microphone/webcam for my PC? <body> My PC doesn't have a mic or webcam, and it's been that way because I've survived with my iPad, whenever I needed to Skype with friends.  However, I do need the microphone on my PC, but before going off to buy a microphone, I wanted to know if it was possible to use my iPad as my PC's microphone.  I have an iPad Air 2, and my PC has Windows 8.1.  <comment240250> that set up would be  very complicated, you better off getting a cheep video cam with mic and plug it in the USB on your PC. <comment240257> @Buscar웃 That's the best advice. Also, I doublt it would even work without Jailbreaking your iPad. Seriously, I bought a webcam for 7€ and it works really great! It has been up and running for 4 years.
