Mac mini Startup Chime & Blank Screen: Troubleshooting Help? <body> Mac mini, Late 2012.  When I press the power button I hear the startup chime, but nothing appears on the display.  I have tried strongMac mini  Thunderbolt to VGA  LCD Monitor A/strong and strongMac mini  HDMI to DVI cable  LCD Monitor B/strong.  I have tried resetting the SMC.  I have tried resetting NVRAM.  When I tap the caps lock key on the wired USB keyboard, the light toggles.  I have unplugged everything but the display cable and keyboard (and even tried without keyboard), without any change.  Are there any suggestions for further troubleshooting? My Genius Bar here typically is reserved 7+ days out.
