How to pass variables from bash script to AppleScript <body> I have a file with a list of URL's. I need to pass each URL from a bash script to be used in an AppleScript.    precodewhile read urls do      osascript -e \     'tell application "Safari"         tell window 1              tell current tab to open location "$urls"         end tell     end tell' done &lt;file.txt /code/pre  This doesn't work. It passes the literal string code$urls/code as the location to be opened in Safari. How can I pass the bash variable code$urls/code to AppleScript?  <answer266704> The  quotes don't expand the variable in AppleScript.  What you need to do is  ESCAPE the quotes:  'tell current tab to open location \"$urls\"`  However, a better way to do this is using coderun argv/code.  For example:  precode#!/bin/bash url="foobar.com" osascript -e 'on run {myurl}' -e 'tell application "Safari" to set the URL of the document to myurl' -e 'end run' $url  /code/pre  My preference is to use a emseparate/em script for the AppleScript. In bash, this would look like:  precode#!/bin/bash osascript -e 'do scriptname \"$url\"' /code/pre  <answer266728> This should work:  precodewhile read urls do      osascript -e "tell application \"Safari\" to open location \"$urls\"" done&lt;file.txt /code/pre  <comment334423> The double quotes *do* expand, the single ones around the whole script don't. <comment334426> @patrix - I've never run into the issue where what was in the single quote didn't work as expected - at least from what I recall. <comment334428> I'm getting an error - `syntax error: A “,” can’t go after this command name.` <comment334429> That comma was a typo; it shouldn't be there. <comment334430> Ok I see that now. Will this work to open a list of multiple url's? <comment334435> @allan try `echo '$PATH'` <comment334436> Thanks @patrix - I'm doing this all from memory on a Win10 machine.  :-) <comment334437> Yes.  You can have as many arguments as you like.  It would take on the syntax:  `osascript -e script arg1 arg2 ... argN`.  You will just have to create the logic to handle the multiple arguments.
