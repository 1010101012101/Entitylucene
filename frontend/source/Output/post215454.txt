Managing Metered Connections on OSX <body> I'm being forced to use my Macbook more and more with my metered 4G connection. I really need to keep data usage limited. Windows has an metered connection mode which really helps with this.   What's the best way to handle this issue in the OSX world? Perhaps some use of the firewall? Is there any sort of logging happening as to what is using the network?  Thanks for your help :-)  <answer215507> I just had a google around some firewalls. Murus basic looks ok, and it's currently half price at $10. I might give it a go. http://www.murusfirewall.com/  <answer215508> h3Little Snitch/h3  Little Snitch lets you restrict specific network traffic from apps and processes. You can configure it to switch profiles automatically depending on the network that it is connected through.  You can set up Little Snitch to prompt on new connections, or configure the connections before the access attempt.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XUCKh.png" alt=""   <answer215509> h3TripMode/h3  TripMode works on a whitelist system and blocks entire apps/processes from accessing the internet.     When TripMode is ON, it prevents all your Mac apps from accessing the Internet but those that have been whitelisted by yourself. It typically stops automatic updates, online backups, Photos syncs, and various obscure apps from consuming precious data. Both uploads and downloads are blocked.   <comment260256> Little Snitch can log the volumes - your question is unclear if that is what you want - can you explain what a metered connection does/show and what you need <comment260301> Thanks Mark. Windows allows you to mark selected network connections as 'metered'. When you're connected to them, Windows won't download any updates. Also, app developers can check the status of the connection and optionally limit traffic. Little snitch seems like a simple firewall, not dissimilar to the firewall included with Windows. You could use this to manually restrict certain apps at certain times. Not sure if it supports different configs for different connections to effectively auto switch. You might have to switch it on and off manually. Thanks :-) <comment260798> grrr.    Murus is a front end for PF which is a network firewall, not an application firewall. PF is not able to block traffic at application level. It can block only at network level. So to block an application you have to block one or more ports/protocols. These blocks are active at system level, so all applications will be unable to access it.  I guess I need Little Snitch or similar :-(  From http://murusfirewall.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=297
