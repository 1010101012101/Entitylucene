Disable System Integrity Protection on OS X running on VMware <body> I have an instance of OS X El Capitan running on VMWare Workstation 10. I need to make changes to code/System/code and therefor have to disable System Integrity Protection. How do I access recovery mode on this VM so I can disable SIP?  <answer210893> VMware has an answer to this question. See Using the Recovery Environment (Recovery HD) in an OS X Virtual Machine:     ol   liPower on the virtual machine./li   liQuickly, in the blank black window or at the VMware splash screen, click inside the virtual machine window so that the mouse pointer disappears.  Now your keystrokes will go into the virtual machine./li   liQuickly, before the Apple logo appears, press and hold the kbdCommand  âŒ˜/kbd key and the kbdR/kbd key together./li   liOnce you see the Apple logo appear, release the keys./li   /ol      If you completed steps 1 through 3 quickly enough, the virtual machine will boot into the Recovery Environment.   <answer237693> This option is valid for vCenter, not sure about Workstation.  You might have a machine that boots very fast and are unable to hit keys in time.  Click on VM and select tab Summary and then under VM Hardware - Edit Settings: VM Options: Boot Options: Boot Delay Enter 5000 as milliseconds ( 5 seconds ).  Restore settings when done to avoid unnecessary boot delay in future.  <answer246716> VMware Workstation 12 on Windows 10.  The steps does work. It will boot into a window that let u reinstall the OS, disk utilities, and two other options (I can' remember).  Then above you will see "Window" click it and you will see a drop down that allow access to terminal.  then type:  precodecsrutil disable /code/pre  Restart the VM.   <answer257497> I was able to get this working on my Windows VMware install after many tries. (And yes I know I'm not supposed to do that, but I'm also not supposed to drive over 55 MPH either).  In hindsight, my mistakes were either not using the correct key combo, or not holding it long enough.  I had to edit the VM config file (.vmx, in the virtual machine folder) to add the 5 second delay.  Then the correct key combo on a Windows keyboard was Windows-R, and I had to press that once and hold it for the 10 seconds or so until the apple logo appeared.  Then it went through what seemed to be the normal boot sequence, but at the end put me into recovery mode where I could bring up a terminal window, and type  precodecsrutil disable /code/pre  Finally, exactly what I needed to get my screen resolution back!  <answer284623> I take a hint from a comment in this blog post and realize that disabling SIP in guest VM is actually simple.  ol liIn VMWare boot screen, click F12 to enter BIOS setup/li liSelect Boot Maintenance Manager  Boot From File/li liSelect the recovery HD and pick the right efi/li liAfter booting into recovery mode, start Terminal/li liExecute codecsrutil disable/code/li /ol  <comment254479> You can have a look at this question : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-max-os-x-el <comment254493> Are you able to boot into Recovery Mode on a VMWare instance? Can you mount the VMWare instance as an external drive and make the modifications that way? <comment254545> @GrahamMiln I have tried to boot into recovery mode by holding down the Super key + R during the VMs startup but it just boots normally. <comment254673> VMware does not support virtualizing OS X under VMware Workstation and you are violating the Apple SLA for OS X by doing so! <comment254692> So I tried your solution (although replacing the Command key with the Windows/Super key) and it didn't work.  I also tried setting `rootless=1` as a bootarg in NVRAM, but I think Apple took that away with the GM seed of 10.11.  Would taking the virtual disk from VMWare workstation and adding it to a VM on VMWare Fusion and doing it from there be an option? <comment254789> This is probably due to the fact that the Super and Command keys are not exactly the same thing. The key maps are probably different.  As stated earlier, the OS X license only allows you to run virtual instances from a Mac host. <comment321545> Please mention at least the statuatory tires to fit ehhm no, the precise line(s) to add in the vmx  if you are driving faster than 55MPH <comment323075> Well, I got pretty close.  I got to the macOS Utilities screen, then Utilities and then Terminal.  But I can't type anything in the Terminal window.  The mouse cursor changes to a small plus-sign and clicking in Terminal's client window does not appear to shift the focus to Terminal (or if it does, it's just ignoring the keystrokes).  Hmmmmm.....???
