The Keyboard on my iMac seems to be typing slow and garbled <body> The bluetooth keyboard on my iMac seems  to work for a while then starts to skip letters or mix up letters while I am typing. It seems there is also a delay between the time I type a character and when it shows up on screen. I've switched to my wired keyboard and the same thing happens. If I reboot, the problem goes away for a while, then comes back. Any suggestions?  <answer269408> Apple says the following:  You may have accidentally set an option that changes how your keyboard operates.  Choose Apple menu  System Preferences, click Accessibility, then click Keyboard. Make sure Slow Keys is turned off. If Slow Keys is on, you must hold down a key longer than usual before itâ€™s recognized.  If the problem persists, enter "Safe Mode" to bypass all third party system extensions and only load the required system components. This should help you determine whether third-party software is to blame for your situation.  If you google "Apple HT201262" you will find the article describing how to do this (I can't refer to 2 links/articles yet, sorry!)  Would you still face these issues in Safe Mode, then my final advise is to contact Apple directly.
