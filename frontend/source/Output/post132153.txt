Change volume on a multi output device - Mac <body> ;) I have a small problem... When creating a multi output device in the application "MIDI" on the mac, i don't have any problems at all. Now i want to make Videos (YouTube) and wanted to output the computer audio to the "Build in output" and to "Soundflower". It works fine, but the only problem is, that if i want to change the volume with the volume keys i can't because its locked (view Image).  So I went to google and searched for solutions and found the way to just change the volume on the different devices manually. But isn't there a easier solution? I just want to be able to change the volume with the keys again and use that multi output device.  Greetings  PS: please don' mind my english because i am from Switzerland... ;) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5odY.png" alt="Screenshot"  <comment155315> Press the volume-thingy on top in the menu after you hold the alt-button. You should be able to pick the source. <comment155344> Thanks but i know how to change the in/out-put device. :)
