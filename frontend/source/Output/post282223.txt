Iphone 5s won't play music when turned off <body> My Iphone 5s used to play music when turned off (not shut down). When turned off while on youtube, it could be turned on and, before entering the passcode, would show: volume control, video title, video length, progression through video, and play/pause. Recently, however, these features will disappear when I press the play button. Is this a new update, or a problem? If the latter is correct, how do I fix it? Thank you! I use online youtube from both google and bing as search engines, and run ios version 10.3.1  <comment355378> Welcome to Ask Different. :) What version of iOS are you running? And what apps do you use to play your music, YouTube videos, etc?
