Can Keynote on iOS play PowerPoint files with audio? <body> I have a family member who's considering buying an iPad. The biggest needs she has is to see PowerPoint presentations with music/audio.  She currently has an iMac with Microsoft Office installed, and thus she can read 99% of the PowerPoint ppt/pptx file. I fear that the iPad might not be able to play any presentation's music.  How can this be done on the iPad? If this requires an app to be purchased, that's OK.  <answer35527> I have recently just put a presentation together which had music and a video and it played the same as on the computer using Keynote. There is another app (which I have not used) which might work better and be the first thing to try (it's free): Slide Shark.  <answer96929> If you haven't bought Keynote yet, there are other ways to show PowerPoint presentation with embedded audios - save powerpoint as quicktime movie.  ol liClick “File” on the ribbon and choose “Save as Movie” in the drop-down menu./li liIn the pop up window, type in the file name and select a destination folder for the output movie.
