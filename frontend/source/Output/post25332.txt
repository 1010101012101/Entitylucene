How to stop downloads from being organized by date? <body> Many moons ago I installed an application that moves downloads into a desktop folder with today's date as the title. I would like to stop this behavior.  However, I cannot remember what I did to cause this behavior.  Specs:   ul li10.7.x/li liMac Pro./li /ul  Things I've tried:  ul liI checked System Preferences and Activity Monitor, and see nothing obvious.   /li liI made a separate test user account, and this behavior does not occur in this account./li /ul  Any other ideas what to look for to get rid of this, would be most welcome.  <answer25337> I have a two places for you to look...maybe one hits  ul liLook for a folder action on the downloads folder (right click on it and see if there is anything at the bottom of the list)  You may have used automator to do this/li liAre you running Hazel?  Check system preferences to see if it is installed/li /ul  <answer25387> So, the answer should be the Glims.  Either uninstall the Glims, or config the GLims not to organize the downloading into dated folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5tjkv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment28648> Did u install the Glims for the Safari? <comment28679> Thank you thank you.. it was indeed Glims. <comment28726> I don't have the voting power to thank you properly, but really appreciate the effort in helping.
