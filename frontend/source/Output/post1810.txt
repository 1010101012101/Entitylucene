Is it possible to connect my iPhone 3G via Bluetooth to both OS on my MacBook? <body> I'm trying to connect my iPhone 3G to my MacBook via Bluetooth to use the iPhone Tethering. When I connect the iPhone to the OSX everything works fine. Since I often also use Windows 7 on the Bootcamp partition I'd like to connect from Windows 7 to the iPhone as well.  This works, but in this case I always have to remove and reconnect it when booting back to OSX and vice versa.  Is it possible to setup the Bluetooth connection and have it working in both operating systems on the same MacBook?  <answer1811> The bluetooth connection is maintained by the OS (Windows or Mac OS X) so as soon as you restart, the connection is lost and you have to re-establish it.  <comment1572> Thanks for your answer. I'm aware that I have to re-establish the connection. My problem is if I'm cross booting, the iPhone is not recognized by OSX or Win7.
