Does OS X El Capitan have a /boot folder <body> I know that the code/boot/code folder contains the static files of the 'boot' loader.  I'm just curious to why I can't see this folder on my Mac. Im using OS X El Capitan.  Does OS X El Capitan have a code/boot/code folder or is there an alternative?  <answer245807> The OS X boot loader is stored in a file called codeboot.efi/code which you can find in code/System/Library/CoreServices/code. It isn't stored in code/boot/code.  You can read more about the OS X boot process on Apple's website here: Mac Developer Library - Kernel Programming Guide - The Early Boot Process  <comment303097> In which systems does `/boot` contain the boot loader?
