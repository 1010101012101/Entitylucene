iTunes Connect : app submitted for French Store ended up in US Store <body> I submitted an app which got reviewed and accepted. However when I search the App Store for the app, results are empty.  The issue was clear when I followed the "view on the app store" link from itunes connect : an error dialog popped up saying that "strongthis item [...] is not available on the french store, but it is in the US store/strong"  This is not the first app I submit, and it never happened before. All my previous apps were available on the french store. I don't understand what went wrong ...  Any ideas?  <answer145814> OK so in the end, Apple replied that "the app is live" after "reviewing [my] account".  Well, I don't know if they changed something or if the app finally went live worldwide with time... It's all good now  <comment171446> Have you contacted Apple? I don't think there is much you can do (or AskDifferent users can do, for that matter) but get in touch with them. <comment171450> Yes, I followed the instructions on the Contact Us page in iTunes Connect. Maybe someone here has a similar experience to share, but yeah, I guess only Apple can help me
