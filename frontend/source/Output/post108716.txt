How to further determine what rogue Firefox (upload) processes are doing <body> h2Config and issue/h2  I have a late 2011 MBP, running Mac OS X 10.7.5, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5, with 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3.  I have just updated my firefox 20 to 25, this issue also occurred with v 20.  When I am uploading files, or just general browsing, sometimes I get a few firefox processes which start to use up CPU cycles, consequently my fans start to spin up.  If I quit Firefox, the processes stay active.  hr  h2Here is what I have done so far:/h2  strongps aux|grep firefox/strong  precodemacbook-pro:~ &lt;my user&gt;$ ps aux|grep firefox &lt;my user&gt;  29061  84.7  0.0  3699392    304   ??

Here's a somewhat tedious process to troubleshoot this further. It may be a bad plugin or a corrupt profile.  Start Firefox in Safe Mode so you can confirm if this problem is due to any plugin or extension. If it works fine in Safe Mode, then you would have to go a bit more slowly and disable one at a time to see which one makes a difference.  You can do also use Firefox with a newly created profile. If that makes a difference, then your old profile is corrupt in some way and you could just start using this profile and add your previous extensions one by one (don't forget to copy over bookmarks from the previous profile if you decide to stick with the new one).  You can look at the crashes by going to the strongabout:crashes/strong page (from the address bar) and load an easy-to-read crash report that may point to issues.  Also look at the instructions and information in Firefox uses too many CPU resources - How to fix.  <answer119503> This is still occurring.  As a strongwork around/strong every time the processes "runs" away I issue the following command, since even if I upload one image, there may be up to ten "rogue" firefox processes:  precodefor i in `ps axu | grep '[f]irefox' | awk '{print $2}'`;do kill -s 9 $i; done  /code/pre  I tried to get the above done with the codecut/code command but could not get it to work. I have posted a related question here.  <comment130297> Thanks for this, I wish I could upvote you twice or thrice +3, it was really bugging me. The issue was a corrupt profile. <comment139384> Sorry same issue still going.
