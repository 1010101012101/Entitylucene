iTunes 12: How to cycle through View Options with script/shortcut? <body> I'm trying to writing an applescript that cycles through Songs, Albums, Artists, Composers, Genres, and back to Songs.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xfImA.png" alt="Problem"  There is nothing in applescript Dictionary with regards to this, so I have to resort to UIscripting/Accessibility. This is what I have so far:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "iTunes"      set frontmost to true -- necessary     delay 1 -- for last line to take effect, delete if you bind this to keyboard shortcut      tell window 1 -- tell window "iTunes" only works when in fullscreen          tell pop up button 2 to perform action "AXPress" -- equivalent of         --keystroke "j" using {command down}          tell UI element 1 of row 5 of table 1 of pop over 1 of pop up button 2 to perform action "AXPress"         -- pressing Genres button, assuming Vies is not in Genres already, of course      end tell end tell /code/pre  You can run this with Script Editor, or preferably for the purpose of the rest of this question, bind it to a keyboard shortcut and invoke it while in iTunes. When you run this, you see the pop up menu flash on your screen, right?  Now, here is the interesting part: Use your cursor to click the pop up button, move down and position the cursor on emArtists/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjP25.png" alt="Cursor"  The cursor itself is omitted by OS X Screenshot function, but you can see emArtists/em is in focus. Now press emEsc/em to hide the menu, and invoke the script while the cursor in still in this position.  Bam! You now switched to emArtists/em view. It turns out the 2nd codeperform action "AXPress"/code is performed under cursor because the pop up menu is not in focus after clicking the vie option button.  There is a simpler way to verify this problem/bug. 1) Click view option. 2) Press emDown/em key a couple times. You would expect focus would move to emSongs/em, and then emAlbums/em, right? Nope, you are just moving through library items in the background, all the while the menu is still in display in the foreground.  So, my question boils down to, emhow can I move cursor focus to this pop up menu?/em  strongUPDATE:/strong Thanks @jackjr300 for the answer. This what my finished script looks like:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         set frontmost to true         delay 1         tell pop up button 2 of window 1             click              if value of attribute "AXDescription" is "Genres" then                 tell (select row 1 of table 1 of pop over 1) to click UI element 1             end if             if value of attribute "AXDescription" is "Songs" then                 tell (select row 2 of table 1 of pop over 1) to click UI element 1             end if             if value of attribute "AXDescription" is "Albums" then                 tell (select row 3 of table 1 of pop over 1) to click UI element 1             end if             if value of attribute "AXDescription" is "Artists" then                 tell (select row 4 of table 1 of pop over 1) to click UI element 1             end if             if value of attribute "AXDescription" is "Composers" then                 tell (select row 5 of table 1 of pop over 1) to click UI element 1             end if          end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer152279> Use the codeselect/code command to select the row.  precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         set frontmost to true          delay 1         tell pop up button 2 of window 1             click             tell (select row 5 of table 1 of pop over 1) to click UI element 1         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre
