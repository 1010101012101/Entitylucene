NTFS-Bootcamp-partition thinks it is a FAT partition <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4gie2.png" alt="enter image description here"I'm running 10.8.3 Snow Leopard and installed Windows 7 x64 using Bootcamp. Both system are running fine.  I couldn't use the bootcamp-partition inside in Parallels and then I read about Tuxera NTFS blocking it. Therefore I uninstalled Tuxera NTFS. Ever since then the disk utility shows the Bootcamp partition as a FAT-partition (see attached screenshot). Re-installing Tuxera NTFS didn't help either.  Error checking and repairing with the disk utility doesn't help. I tried unmounting the whole drive/all partitions via disk utility on another Mac (using FireWire-boot). It didn't work sadly.  Does anyone have a clue what else I can do? The Bootcamp-Windows is already set up with my work-environment which took a long time so I don't want to reinstall.  <comment103232> Aside from displaying the filesystem type incorrectly is there anything that's not working for you?  p.s. you didn't attach the screen shot <comment103290> I attached the screenshot. Parallels doesn't recognize the Bootcamp partition so I can't use it in Parallels. <comment103360> Bootcamp still works, right? If you boot into Windows what does Window report as the filesystem type? <comment103564> Bootcamp works. In Windows the partition shows up as NTFS.
