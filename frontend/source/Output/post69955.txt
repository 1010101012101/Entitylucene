How to stop xampp mysql server? <body> I just installed xampp on my mac os x. When I tried start mysql it displays a message that codemysql is already running on this computer. In order to start mysql stop first mysql/code. I tried following ways to stop it but neither of them works.  precodemysqladmin version sudo /usr/local/mysql/mysql.server stop //mysql.server command not found mysqladmin -u root -p password shutdown //restarts the server but not shutdown /code/pre  when i use codewhich mysql/code command it shows this path  precode/usr/local/bin/mysql /code/pre  and when I issue codeps aux | grep mysqld/code command I get following output  precodezafarsaleem    85209   0.0  0.3  2699804  13204   ??

I am very new to mac os x so don't really know how to resolve this issue. Please help...  <answer69956> I always use the activity monitor to quit mysql. I'm not sure why it would show up there and not on the commond line, but it is worth a try.   <answer70029> Your MYSQL instance that is running is here code/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysqld/code (the MAMP one) and here code/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.20/bin/mysqld/code (the one installed using Brew).  Try:  precode/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysqladmin shutdown /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.20/bin/mysqladmin shutdown /code/pre  Then start the one you want to start. You also would want to check codeLibrary/LaunchDaemons//code for any launch scripts and use something like  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql.plist /code/pre  strongUpdate/strong: Please list the output of following commands:      ls /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep mysql      ls /Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep mysql      ls ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep mysql  <answer230597> just restart the .dml file in your account  <comment81240> I tried that but it is also not exiting from activity monitor. <comment81290> It does show up in activity monitor? If it does you should be able to force quit it form there. <comment81340> I followed your instructions. Here is what I did: I first issue `ps aux | grep mysqld`. THEN I execute this command `/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.20/bin/mysqladmin shutdown` but I am getting this error `/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.20/bin/mysqladmin: shutdown failed; error: 'Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SHUTDOWN privilege(s) for this operation'`. <comment81342> Please see my updated post as well <comment81343> It is there but unfortunately it is keep restarting when I force quit mysql server with another Process ID. <comment81352> Take a look a here: http://stackoverflow.com/q/6697553/1357229 or here: http://stackoverflow.com/q/100948/1357229 <comment81353> I already followed them and if you see me updates in my post you will find out. <comment82336> Please list the output of following commands:    ls /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep mysql     ls /Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep mysql     ls ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep mysql <comment140644> You might want to check out Mamp instead of Xampp, I find it working much easier and better than Xampp. <comment281453> How exactly is this done?
