Lion - automatic file versioning - details <body> Can anybody explain some details about stronghow is implemented the automatic file versioning/strong in the Lion?  ul liIt is transparent for any file? (for example, for files created in the Terminal.app with shell command like codels &gt;file.txt/code and codels -l &gt; file.txt/code mean than the codefile.txt/code got versioning?, or/li lievery application should call some codeversioning API/code at the save?/li /ul  <answer16172> The only information has released to non-Mac Developer Program members is the following.     If you have a document-based application, Lion offers an efficient, built-in auto save feature that stores changes to the working document instead of creating additional copies on a disk. Versions automatically records a history of changes made to your documents and lets your app display a Time Machine like interface so users can browse through previous versions. ADC   There is more information available for Mac Developer Program subscribers. The information, however, is currently restricted by a non-disclosure agreement . The information will most likely be made available for everyone once the final version of Lion is released. This is how Apple have done it in the past.  Personally I am a bit disappointed that Apple chose to go with ‘something else’ instead of the native handling of this offered by the ZFS file system. (As rumored as far back as Leopard.)  <comment17667> lion questions are currently off-topic. <comment17668> +1 for mentioning ZFS :) <comment17669> ZFS would've been great from a technical perspective, but became a non-option the moment it was announced that Oracle might buy Sun.  AIUI there's just no way Apple was going to give Oracle that sort of licensing leverage. <comment17671> Just browsed a bit and for now im sure than versioning will need support from developer, so the application must be built with some API to support versioning. It is **not** OS level.
