Raid disk partition does not auto mount <body> HD3 does not mount up without doing an unmount &amp; mount in disk utility. Is this caused by the Apple_Boot Recovery HD disk 2s4?  If so how do I delete it &amp; get HD3 to auto mount?/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS OWC HD 1                1.3 TB     disk2s2    3:                  Apple_HFS OWC HD 2                1.3 TB     disk2s3    4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk2s4    5:                  Apple_HFS OWC HD 3                1.3 TB     disk2s5
