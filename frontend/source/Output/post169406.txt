Can I copy a file to iCloud drive from the command line? <body> I'd like to write a script to backup some files to my iCloud drive. The drive shows up in the Finder, but I don't see it from the command line.  Is there a way to do something like:     cp mystuff.tgz /iCloudDrive/backups/   <answer169410> strongiCloud Drive/strong directory is located here:  precode~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs /code/pre  There are some other directories listed inside codeMobile Documents/code, their names depend on the app which owns them. For example: codecom~apple~Pages//code.
