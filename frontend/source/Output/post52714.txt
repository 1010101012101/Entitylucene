ZEVO ZFS and Aperture <body> I'ld like to use ZEVO (ZFS) on my Storage-Device. There shall the Aperture-Library be stored.  Are there any issues using an Aperture - Library on ZFS formatted device.  Thanks allot  <answer52732> You can't run an Aperture Library from a device that's not formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled).  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3509  What can work is running a Referenced Library with the Library on an appropriately formatted disk and the Masters stored elsewhere.  Another workaround: Make a Disk Image formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and store that on your device.
