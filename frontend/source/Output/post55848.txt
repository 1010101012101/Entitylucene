How to find out devices associated as iMessage client with my apple ID <body> Is it possible to find out what devices have been registered to receive iMessage with my Apple ID?   I can only see my phone number and Apple ID in iMessage settings, but not what devices are registered.  <answer85653>    Itunes  Itunes Store  Click on email id after logging in (i.e. view account)  Manage Devices    That should get you a list of devices, that you have your appleid enabled on. You can check those device settings to see if iMessage is enabled and if yes, under what ID.  <comment98798> not exactly what I'm looking for, but solves the problem. Thanks! <comment285796> I don't see 'Manage Devices' there. It seems that it's a huge security leak in Apple's devices. <comment286868> [apple's specific instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT205064) here's [another link](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204074)
