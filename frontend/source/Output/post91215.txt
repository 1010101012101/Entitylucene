How to Make Gmail Remember my User ID and Passwords with Safari <body> I work in marketing and have several Gmail accounts established exclusively for my clients advertising programs that I must access frequently. Until a few days ago, each time I opened any Gmail account the User ID (Gmail address) and password have remained saved and would populate as I entered the first character of the Gmail address I was attempting to open.  When a colleague asked me to open her Gmail account during a time when her system was down, I unintentionally clicked "never for this Web site" when Safari asked if I wanted to save her logon information and password. I realize now that I had clicked the wrong option and since that time none of the Gmail accounts are saved requiring that I enter the full address and password each time.  I've followed the instructions on the help menu but nothing has worked. I use Safari version 6.0.4 and Mac OSX version 10.7.5. Any suggestions would be appreciated.    <answer91221> There are three solutions I've found. The first two are the easiest and least intrusive, the strongthird one should be tried last/strong as it will remove strongall/strong saved passwords for other websites too em(but the third seems to have worked the most times for other people)/em  h2a. Safari Preferences/h2     Locate and strongdelete/strong the entry for Gmail that is set to 'Passwords   Never Saved':      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QzZF7.png" alt="Safari Password Preferences"   h2b. Remove Keychain Entry/h2     open Keychain Access (in Utilities), then look in the login keychain   and find the site you tried to visit. Somewhere in the list, you'll   see an entry like this:  precodewww.somesite.com (Passwords not saved) /code/pre      Simply delete that item from the login keychain, restart Safari, and   Safari will prompt you to save usernames and passwords when logging in   to that site. The easiest way to find it in Keychain Access is to   search for it using part of the website's URL as your search term.   h2c. Reset Safari/h2     ol   liOpen Safari/li   liClick Safari  Reset safari/li   liTick codeRemove saved names &amp; passwords/code/li   liClick Reset Safari/li   liQuit, Repoen and load Gmail/li   /ol   <comment107148> You are incredible!
