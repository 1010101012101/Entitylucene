AIM Messages don't display in Mavericks Notification Center <body> On my work computer, I am only using Messages on Mavericks to connect to AIM. I am noticing these are not showing up in notification center with 'quick reply', though I would like them to. Is this true of all non-iMessage accounts, all the time?  If so, are there any workarounds to getting AIM messages to appear in notification center?
