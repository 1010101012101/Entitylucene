What is the meaning behind the Mac OS X Console application Icon? <body> I tried searching on web but could not find any substantial answer about the meaning behind this icon.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvUG7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment182353> What kind of meaning?  The console shows warnings. <comment182357> I mean if it relates something with Apple. I guess the time 7:36 has some significance with Apple history or it is just random. <comment182402> I don't know if it has significance for Apple, but I am amused by the seemingly endless threads of people who think it's saying there's something wrong with their computer. <comment182562> It would be interesting to know why they chose 7:36 and I think it is hilarious that some people think their computer is warning them.
