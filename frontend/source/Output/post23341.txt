Changing the icon on the "window bar" Mac OS X <body> I was wondering how I could change the icon in the "window bar" of my Mac app  I've also added a picture of the icon I want to change since i believe window bar isn't the correct term.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wSnnq.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thank you in advance! :)  <answer23343> You'll want to use code-setRepresentedFilename:/codeor the other similar methods. I don't think you can just change the icon to anything, it has to be associated with a file.  <comment26059> Why was this moved ? This was a question meant for stack overflow... In the original post it had the tag objective-c and also xcode along with mac and mac, and this is something that is manage in Xcode so this is a mistake by the moderators... <comment26060> Yes exactly! I can't understand why they did that so I had to open a new post.. -.- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7217945/changing-the-icon-on-the-window-bar-mac-os-x-in-xcode <comment26062> Trust me, when I got to this question there was no objective-c or xcode tag, but i'll migrate it back if you want. <comment26064> Indeed there are no tags. But that doesn't mean it's not related to those topics, it was just mistagged...
