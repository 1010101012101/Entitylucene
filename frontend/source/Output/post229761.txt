El Capitan download problems <body> I am trying to update a mac mini from OS 10 10 5 up to ElCap  App store tells me the app has Downloaded but nothing happens  I have looked at a few posts on this forum so have looked in the Apps folder but there is no El Cap installer there.  Any ideas how I can force another download, or find the installer on my machine(assuming it has actually downloaded)  Any ideas  <answer229792> Try to restart your computer and try repeat last actions.  It was helpful at similar discussion.  <comment280320> Don't know whether it's related but there seem to be certification problems at the OSX App Store.  http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/03/older-os-x-installers-broken-by-certificate/
