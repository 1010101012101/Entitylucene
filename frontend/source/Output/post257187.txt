Why does my iPhone 5c say it cannot take new photos even after I delete 100 or so? <body> I tried to take a photo but got an error message saying storage was full.  So, I deleted about 100 photos (from both Camera Roll and Recently Deleted), but I still get the same message.  On top of that I also deleted about 40 mp3s and 3 or 4 apps and restarted the phone, but it's still the same.  Whats the deal?  <answer288149> h2Restore from a backup./h2  It looks like there are a lot of cached files on your phone that shouldn't be there. Usually restoring from a backup will clear all of this system trash as it only backs up personal information.  strongNote:/strong an iTunes backup will be more complete and will contain a lot more app data than iCloud, so that is recommended if you are able to use iTunes.  h3iTunes (recommended)/h3  ol liMake an iTunes backup.

Settings  General  Storage & iCloud Usage  Manage Storage  Does anything in there look odd? <comment335178> @DanHergenreder 'Other' is taking up the most space <comment335179> Do a full backup/restore with iTunes and should clear up the problem. Happened to my girlfriend.
