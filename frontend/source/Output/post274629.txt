Apple TV 4th gen goes black when airplay mirrored to ? <body> We have an apple TV 4th gen in our office, running the latest version of the OS.   We have 2 machines both macbook pro's late 2012 running 10.10.5 that regularly screen share via the apple TV.   One of the laptops always connects fine to the apple TV, but one of the laptops have an issue where it can select that it wants to airplay, the apple tv will go off the menu as if its about to display the airplay from the laptop, but the apple TV then displays a black screen.   Any idea why this is happening and how i could be resolved ?
