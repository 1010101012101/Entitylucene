Contextual Menu Keyboard Shortcuts <body> Is it possible to create a keyboard shortcut for a contextual menu item and if so, how? I'm not sure if this functionality was available in Lion, but if it wasn't, maybe it is in Mountain Lion.   <answer59614> You can set shortcuts for emsome/em context shortcuts, specifically anything that's a service. Most app-specific context menu items aren't services (although some, such as services to modify a file in a particular app are), so they can't be assigned shortcuts. So it depends which items you want a shortcut for, but it's doable.  To add a shortcut for a service, open strongKeyboard Preferences/strong, click the strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong tab, and select strongServices/strong in the left pane. Then look for the context menu item you want in the right pane, click it and you'll get an option to set a shortcut.  <comment68532> Most contextual menu items have corresponding shortcuts in the menubar. Which app are you looking to add shortcuts to?
