Bind <Cmd-S> in Vim <body> Is it possible to map  to save in vim in a standard terminal? I know how to set it in my vimrc but am not sure if it is possible to pass it from terminal to vim instead of attempting to save the terminal.  <answer49197> Yes you should be able to set up a key mapping in your .vimrc file so that when you press command - S it maps to :w  Also here is something else to go on that you can modify as well Map Ctrl-S to save current or new files  ul liFirst thing is to reassign the the Command - S functionality for the Application. Do this in the Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts System Preference Pane./li /ul  For example, you will want to add in a new Application Short cut for the Terminal app, then map to the Menu title "Export Text As..." to another keyboard command something that you don't use, e.g. control - s or etc. should be fine.   ul liNext stop mac terminal from trying to interpret Cmd-s by ... strong(still working on this I asked a separate question for a solution Allow the Terminal.app to pass command key  based keystrokes to terminal programs )/strong/li liSet up the mapping in the .vimrc file to map the command or meta and s  keys to the :write function. /li /ul  Something such as this noted below* you can add to you .vimrc:  precode:map &lt;M-s&gt; :w&lt;kEnter&gt;  "Works in normal mode, must press Esc first" :imap &lt;M-s&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;:w&lt;kEnter&gt;i "Works in insert mode, saves and puts back in insert mode" /code/pre  *This was verified working on the X11 terminal on OS X Lion.  <answer172229> For people still coming across this, I've written up an inverse of strongMrDaniel/strong's solution (that is, mapping emany/em MacVim / system-wide ⌘-sequence to command-line codevim/code), and posted it to his other question. It's more complex than his solution, but then allows you to (with some effort) remap emany/em ⌘-sequence into emany/em command-line program.  It works well for me, and I hope it can help you too. &lt;3  <comment56297> Would [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) be an option ? It uses cmd+s for saving. And you can start it from terminal with `mvim`. <comment57069> I am using vim with tmux so macvim wouldn't work. <comment57070> Thanks, will keep an eye on that thread to see if there is a way to get cmd-s passed to the app.
