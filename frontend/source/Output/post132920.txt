Disable App Nap via Javascript/HTML <body> Is there a message that could be sent in a way that at least Safari, if not other browsers, understands that tells Mavericks not to engage App Nap? I have an HTML5 pseudo-MIDI rendering app (i.e., sends individual notes out as mp3 audio) which plays back fine on Safari so long as it's in the foreground, but when focus is lost Safari/OS X does send back sufficient calling information to play the notes at their appropriate times.  What I'd love is something like:  precodeif (window.disallowAppNap !== undefined) {     window.disallowAppNap = true; } this.playScore(callbacks = {end: function() {          if (window.disallowAppNap !== undefined) {            window.disallowAppNap = false;         }     } } ); /code/pre  From a web search, it seems that the answer to this is "Nope," but maybe someone on the OS X or Safari dev. team will see this and think, "that's a great idea!" I've looked through the Web Audio API but can't see anything connecting to App Nap.  <answer132930> Nope, not currently. JavaScript/HTML can't directly control App Nap in Safari or any other browser on OS X.  <comment157381> thanks. Given your reputation, I'm tempted to mark this as Accepted immediately, but I'll give it a day to see if someone's come up with a clever trick. If I haven't marked it by then, please feel free to prod me. <comment157382> @michael Haha, it's not like I'm in need of reputation :) Feel free to leave this unaccepted until an actual answer comes up in the future <comment157396> till then, my thanks. I think that sending a continuous  signal at the minimum possible volume is helping, but it's a bad way of coping. <comment184788> @MichaelScottCuthbert, yes, audio element works for me, it prevents going Firefox to go to App Nap even if audio is muted but it takes some additional CPU usage. Sort of compromise... So I have used some 1sec mp3 in loop with very low bitrate.
