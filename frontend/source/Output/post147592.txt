How do you _unset_ the default printer? <body> I know I'm going to hit myself when someone tells me the answer, but I set the strongDefault Printer/strong on my Mac, and wish I hadn't.  Previously, it would default to the last printer used, which was great.  Now I can't find a way to strongunset/strong the default printer to get back to the stronglast printer used/strong state.  FWIW, I'm on a Mac OS X 10.9.5 - Mavericks.  Command line solutions welcome too...  <answer147595> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong â†’ strongPrinters &amp; Scanners/strong and set strongDefault printer/strong to strongLast printer used/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X5LR4.png" width="349"  <answer147596> I knew I would hit myself, but I Just found my answer.  It's right there in the preferences dialog near the bottom.  I was too focused on the list of printers on the left.  Will delete my own question in just a second.  <comment173986> fair enough - just embarrassed that I asked such a silly question.
