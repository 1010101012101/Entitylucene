Start a process at boot <body> I need dnsmasq to run at boot on Mavericks. I've got dnsmasq working fine. I've created a .plist file in /Library/LaunchDaemons with the following contents:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;uk.org.thekelleys.dnsmasq&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/sbin/dnsmasq&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;--keep-in-foreground&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  This runs perfectly if I do:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/uk.org.thekelleys.dnsmasq.plist /code/pre  However, it does not start at boot. Permissions are: -rw-r-xr-x What am I missing?  <answer114781> Thanks to LCC for pointing out LaunchControl. It indicated the ownership of /Library/LaunchDaemons was incorrect.  The solution to this problem was to be sure /Library/LaunchDaemons had ownership root:admin, and permissions for the directory were rwxr-xr-x  <comment134102> what permissions are set for `uk.org.thekelleys.dnsmasq.plist`? <comment134104> Not sure if you are following this but it might help... http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13691/prevent-launchctl-from-starting-a-anonymous-process <comment134119> @I'L'I: Edited question to include permissions info. <comment134144> Permissions should be -rw-r--r-- (no execute) but I don't think the x will prevent it from starting. One thing I'd try is to remove the --keep-in-foreground option. On boot, any process that tries to access the window server won't run until someone logs in. Also, check /var/log/system.log and see if there are any messages. It might give some information about what's failing. <comment134166> Not an answer, but I'm sure [LaunchControl](http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl) will tell you why. <comment134177> Not an answer, but Lingon (http://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/) can control startup processes and manage .plist files <comment134333> @Sheetzam â€” the important part of the file permissions for launchdaemons is to ensure they belong to the user `root` and the group `wheel`.
