How Do I Lock My Google Drive App (or files) on iPad? <body> How to lock my Google Drive app (or just one file on it) on my iPad so no one can view it if they find my iPad?  <answer99105> It seems that the Google Drive iOS app doesn't have this feature.  There are alternatives that do implement a password lock, like GDrive. However, its user experience seems to be overall less pretty than Google's own app.  As a marginally related side note, Dropbox iOS app does implement a password lock.   <comment116496> I can endorse GDrive for this functionality, as we have implemented this as a solution in my line of business.
