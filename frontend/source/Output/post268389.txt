Can you daisy chain 2 Macbook Pro's onto a single power pack? <body> Can I feed another MBP by USB-C cable from a port on the first laptop?  Power packs can deliver 1.5A (at 220V = 330W) over USB-C to the MBP. MBP power requirement is 4.3A (@ 20.2V = 87W). So seems the power pack can handle it.  Ah but port delivers  900 mA (Milliamps) at 5 V = 4.5W. So guessing answer is no. But my amateur electronics may be wrong so confirmation appreciated.  <answer268395> The USB-C Specification specifies power delivery of up to 100W.     Increased power levels from existing USB standards up to 100W.   You won't be able to "daisy chain" or more technically, emcharge MacBooks in series/em as 100W will be less than the required 174W (87W * 2).  However, you will be able to charge them in parallel if your adapter has the capability to do so.
