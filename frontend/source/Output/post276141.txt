Can I safely delete the "Deleted Users" directory after an upgrade or a data transfer? <body> I have just transferred data from my old MacBook Air to my new MacBook Pro. There is now a codeDeleted Users/code Directory in the code/Users/code directory. Can this be safely deleted?  <answer276142> The Deleted Users directory contains the contents of Home folders of deleted users, usually in the form of disk images. So unless those users had some documents/pictures you want to keep, you can delete it. Your own programs never rely on data in the Home folders of other users - you don't even have access to it, except as an administrator.
