Why is my Mac trying to mount servers from 10+ years ago? <body> strongThis is worm-like behavior./strong  Something is causing my Mac to repeatedly try to mount remote file servers - several of them.  Most of these seem to be SMB servers.  What's most noticeable are those which I last used 10+ years ago, before multiple machine changes, a few complete OS reinstalls, and prompt upgrade to each newer OSX version.  I'm fully patched Sierra now.  Often the mounts are 192.168.0.x or 192.168.1.x, and I've avoided those ranges in DHCP for years, also.  I installed Little Snitch, but it's not really detecting which program is triggering it.  By watching Console I'm seeing something like NetAuthSys immediately preceding, but this only tells me it's getting a message from something else that I'm not seeing.  I checked a SO/Ask Different thread from 2011 but I don't see it applying.  Anyone with suggestions for diagnosis, please chime in!  Thanks in advance!
