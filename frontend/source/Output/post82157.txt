When running a command from terminal, how can I know the full path of the command? <body> Assuming I'm writing in Terminal: 'ctags', how can I know the full path of the command 'ctags?   <answer82159> precode$ type ctags ctags is /usr/bin/ctags $ type -p ctags /usr/bin/ctags /code/pre  The second form is useful for doing things like  precode$ file $(type -p ctags) $ ls -l $(type -p ctags)  /code/pre  and is often aliased to codewhich/code.  hr  If you don't want to rely on codebash/code functionality and prefer an external command, code/usr/bin/whereis/code serves a similar purpose:     The whereis utility checks the standard binary directories for the specified programs, printing out the paths of any it finds.   Because codewhereis/code doesn't use code$PATH/code but rather the result of codesysctl user.cs_path/code it may lead to different results.  <answer82160> Type the command as a parameter, for e.g. to find location of codetar/code  precodels -l $(which tar) /code/pre  which in my case returns  precodelrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  6 Jul 26  2012 /usr/bin/tar -&gt; bsdtar /code/pre  <comment94814> Are you sure it's aliased to `which`?  Also, do you know `whereis`? It's interesting because in my case `whereis ctags` yields different result from `which ctags`. <comment94838> Hmm, right, the alias isn't set by default. `type` is an internal bash command, `/usr/bin/whereis` is an external command. But I would expect them to give the same result.
