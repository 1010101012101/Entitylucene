Mac OS Sierra - Show View Options - Terminal Commands <body> I would like to modify the standard default desktop View Options maximum grid settings in Mac OS Sierra. Before you answer, I am well aware of the standard View Option settings, which I know how to use. The default maximum View Settings currently wraps the file name to 2 lines (with longer file names). The end result I am seeking is to view file names for desktop files on only one line. Does anyone know the Terminal commands to change the default maximum grid setting? Thank you in advance.
