How can I update homebrew and upgrade the new packages in one step? <body> I often run codebrew update/code followed by codebrew upgrade/code.   Can I do that in one step?  <answer123421> Yes, by putting the following line in your ~/.bash_profile file:  precodealias brewu='brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade --lock' /code/pre  codebrewu/code can be replaced by whatever alias you want to use.
