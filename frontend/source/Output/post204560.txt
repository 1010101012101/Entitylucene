How to pass user input to Apple Script then execute? <body> How do I configure Automator to ask for a text input (example: enter website url) and pass the answer to an AppleScript that executes this command:  precodevideo-dl (user input) /code/pre  So, this would be executed in the terminal:  precodevideo-dl http://www.example.com/video.mpg /code/pre  <answer204563> There is no need to use AppleScript here, you can pass data from Automator directly into a shell script.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xtb2O.png" alt="enter image description here"  Depending on where you've stored the script, you may have to include the full path to the script in the action (code/path/to/video-dl "$@"/code).  <comment246588> Any idea how you can show a window that shows progress? You rock! <comment246589> Not really, might be tricky from Automator. Please ask a new question for this if necessary.
