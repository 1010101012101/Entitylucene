Change Dock Expose Activation Time <body> Is there a way to change the amount of time you have to click and hold on a Dock icon to activate Dock Expose? or maybe tie the right click to activate it?  <answer759> I'm not aware of a setting for just clicking on the icon with the mouse other than a default for turning it off...  defaults write com.apple.dock show-expose-menus -boolean  You can change the behaviour of when you drag a file onto a dock icon though...  Go to Finder Preferences and at the bottom of the general tab there is "Spring-Loaded folders and windows"  You can dis/enable it and change the delay time.  <comment639> None of the tweaking applications (Onyx, Cocktail, etc.) have this preference, so assume it may be non-existant. <comment2378> I'm surprised-Dock Expos√© is relatively fast in my opinion.
