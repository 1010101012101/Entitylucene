Keep sessions between private tabs <body> I am used to of the old private browsing mode in Safari, where you can keep a login session between tabs. But since this new Safari came with Yosemite, the tabs maintain their own sessions.   Is there any way I can keep the login session between safari private tabs till the private window closes, just like how Google Chrome does?  <answer162865> No, this is currently not possible. Safari Private Browsing tabs and windows do not share any session data and are completely independent.  From the Apple Support KB "Safari for Mac: Use Private Browsing windows in Safari":    ul liEach tab in the window is isolated from the others, so websites you view in one tab can’t track your browsing in other tabs./li /ul  <comment204577> This doesn't seem to be true. If I ⌘-click a link in a Private Browsing tab, the new tab is logged out of whichever service. <comment220031> @Elliott I don't remember what I was doing when I wrote this answer, but you're true now. Edited answer, thanks.
