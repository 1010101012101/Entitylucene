Bulk Changing Application Icons on System <body> So the question is pretty straight forward. I've disabled SIP (System Integrity Protection) and I am able to use the "copy paste" method, described in numerous tutorials, successfully to change my Application Icons. I'm wondering however if there is a folder where all the Application Icons are stored. I know that the Trash Icons and the Finder Icons are located at codeSystem/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/code and that I'm able to for all intensive purposes "click and drag" the new trash and finder icons to this folder and it update the icons accordingly.  Is there a central location where all Application Icons are stored so that I can click and drag all 50 of my 'new' icons to a folder and then restart the dock app to refresh the icons?  <comment374443> Short answer: no. Icons are stored within the individual application. <comment374445> Awesome! Thanks for the input, would like to see how other people answer though! I'm sure there IS a way, but it might not be short, and thats ok. <comment374448> Short answer of **other** people is still: no. There is **NO** way. The application icons are all stored in .../%application%.app/Contents/Resources/ even the Finder.icns: /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/. You might create an AppleScript which replaces the .icns files though: if \*.icns file exist in source folder search for \*.app and replace its \*.app/Contents/Resources/\*.icns with the one in source folder.
