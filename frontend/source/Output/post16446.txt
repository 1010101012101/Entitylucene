The 'Personal hotspot' option is gone from my iPhone 4. Why? <body> The 'Personal hotspot' option is gone from my iPhone 4. Why? Is there any way to get it back?  <answer16449> Check Settings  General  Network, or restart the phone.  <answer16451> Does your carrier require that you pay for this feature?  I don't know how it's handled in India but in the US, the carriers charge extra for this.  Of course, here in Canada, the carriers provide it for free provided your data plan isn't one of the minimal ones.  So perhaps the problem is that you are not entitled to use it by virtue of not having paid for it?  <answer16452> The same had happened to me (Germany, O2).  Last year, after I had used the Personal Hotspot (WiFi)once, it disappeared from the menu. Recently (new iOS, O2 officially supporting the iPhone by now), Personal Hotspot (the bluetooth thing, actually) worked for 2 minutes or so, then went dead. Technically it is still there but I woun't get anything through to the net.  I think it's something like this (not sure though): The first time you use the personal hotspot, your phone checks with your provider wether it allows to share you mobile internet connection to other devices. If not, it then disables it. If this is correct, the option should reappear when you purchase a 'shareable' data plan. May need some kind of reset though, aswell.  <answer16454> Make sure you have an APN + Username &amp; password set under Settings  General  Network  Cellular Data Network. The bottom option "Internet Tethering" has to be filled in to enable Personal Hotspot.  Apple KB article - iOS: About cellular data network settings (viewing or editing the APN)  <answer30892> Today I get the option back. After 6 month I found Onavo app was the reason to disable "personal Hotspot". I just uninstalled it.  http://getsatisfaction.com/onavo/topics/my_personal_hotspot_configuration_has_gone  I wrote an email to Onavo support about it and got this reply     Dave NOV 09, 2011  |  06:44PM IST Hi Jitendra,      Thanks for replying.

Regards,       Onavo Support  http://onavo.com   <answer91938> Ensure that your Data Roaming (located in Cellular under general settings) is turned on. Once you have done this, you will show your personal hotspot appear.  <answer96102> under cellualr data network, scroll down to internet tethering and write "www" in the APN section. Your personal hotspot will definitly work.  <answer170551> Settings, general, cellular, scroll down, personal hotspot, personal hotspot on. It will re-appear on the first screen. (Settings)  <comment17964> It was working fine for me some days ago <comment17966> Tried as u suggested but problem is still there <comment17967> I was using hotspot from last 20 days it's just disappeared 2 days back <comment17968> I was using before without any problem <comment17969> Maybe your carrier just introduced the 'feature' of forbidding it only recently? <comment17977> It might be but it should not :( <comment18441> Still not showing :( <comment25656> Have you tried the suggestion I mentioned bellow? <comment25663> Cellular Data Network is not showing in my iPhone <comment25671> When you go to Settings / General / Network, what options do you see? <comment25673> Only these http://k.min.us/idE9kTvF1.jpg <comment25755> It would appear you are not the only one having this issue? (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3044480?start=0&tstart=0) Are you running the latest iOS version?
