Follow Up To: "In Sierra: How to get Qt 5.8.0 / PyQt 5.7.1 / sip 4.19 / Python3.5 to install & work correctly?" <body> Since I cannot ask a follow up question as a comment &amp; writing a question as an answer seems inappropriate, I am asking a follow up question to the quoted topic 1.  I am having the same problem (i.e. getting the exact same errors) with PyQt 4.12 using Qt 5.8.0, sip 4.19 and Python 3.6.  Will the solution given in the previous question work in this case?  Thx  RB
