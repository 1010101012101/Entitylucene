What is the proper syntax for setting the nvram backlight-level? <body> I am trying to set my laptop's brightness level via codenvram backlight-level=/code however I keep receiving errors, no matter how I try and input it. These are my past results.  precode~ nvram backlight-level "%96%06" backlight-level %1e%00 nvram: Error getting variable - '%96%06': (iokit/common) data was not found ~ nvram backlight-level %96%06 backlight-level %1e%00 nvram: Error getting variable - '%96%06': (iokit/common) data was not found ~ nvram backlight-level\ %96\%06 nvram: Error getting variable - 'backlight-level %96%06': (iokit/common) data was not found ~ nvram backlight-level = %96%06 backlight-level %1e%00 nvram: Error setting variable - '': (iokit/common) invalid argument ~ nvram backlight-level = &lt;%96%06&gt; zsh: parse error near `\n' ~ nvram backlight-level=&lt;%96%06&gt; zsh: parse error near `\n' ~ nvram backlight-level=&lt;%96%06&gt; zsh: parse error near `\n' ~ nvram backlight-level %96%06 backlight-level %1e%00 nvram: Error getting variable - '%96%06': (iokit/common) data was not found ~ nvram backlight-level="%96%06" nvram: Error setting variable - 'backlight-level': (iokit/common) general error /code/pre  However, I tried this suggestion but I receive this error.  precodenvram backlight-level=%96%06 nvram: Error setting variable - 'backlight-level': (iokit/common) general error /code/pre  What is the issue here, I just am looking for the proper syntax.  <answer252410> You need to use codesudo/code to write to the NVRAM (and it probably also won't hurt to prevent the shell from handling code%/code by quoting it)  precodesudo nvram backlight-level='%96%06' /code/pre
