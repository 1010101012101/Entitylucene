Mac won’t display WiFi login box after upgrade to El Capitan <body> I don’t know if the upgrade to El Capitan is relevant or not, but lately I’ve noticed I can’t connect to the Internet via public WiFi hotspots with my MacBook Pro.  I can connect to WiFi networks themselves and say, my home WiFi network that requires a WPA password. But now when I connect to public WiFi hotspots I no longer get the modal window that usually asks me to log in using my account with that provider.  Is this a setting or something that may have been disabled in El Capitan? If so, how can I get my Mac to display those modals again? (I don’t even know what they’re called so not sure what search terms to use.)   <answer211589> I had this problem with a fresh install of OS X El Capitan. I had to create a new standard user (not admin) and log in as that to get my public internet login page. Returning to admin subsequently has restored the Wi-Fi like normal. A bug surely.  P.S. Found that workaround at: https://discussions.apple.com/message/29042350#29042350  <answer228017> I had this exact same problem and after a lot of trial and error this worked for me:-  ol liGo to Network Preferences/li liTurn Wi-Fi off/li liTurn Wi-Fi back on/li liBefore the network 'joins' the network manually select it form the Network Name dropdown /li liFor me this finally caused the pop-up to appear/li /ol  Sounds like voodoo - no idea why this worked, but it did!  <answer238966> I resolved this issue by removing my custom DNS entries. I prefer to use Google Public DNS and this was disrupting the login screen.  I discovered the issue by running the strongNetwork Diagnostics/strong app after experiencing this problem on a recently upgraded MBP Retina (Yosemite - El Capitan). To run the app, do the following:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong/li liChoose strongNetwork/strong/li liClick strongAssist me.../strong/li liClick strongDiagnostics.../strong/li liWhen the app starts, choose strongWi-Fi/strong and strongContinue/strong/li liTroubleshoot any issues the app reports (your issues might be different than mine)/li /ol  <answer244948> for me this trick always worked - even on the iphone!  Browse directly to the log in screen: http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html  <answer247654> After searching for hours, this solution worked:  Resolving Stubborn Wi-Fi Connection Problems in Mac OS X  To summarize, turn your WiFi off, then move the following files to a folder on your Desktop (for example).  precode/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist  /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.network.identification.plist  /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist  /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist /code/pre  Then reboot, turn your WiFI back on, connect to the network, and the login dialog box should pop up. For me, the second listed above did not exist, so I just moved the other 3. If this works for you, you can delete the files that you moved.  <answer270424> I think the modal (login) window is just loading a web page. Most of the time, if you are connected to the wifi network but you still have to login using the modal window, if you type something in the address bar, you get redirected to a login page. This also happens on my phone, but I need to have mobile data turned off, or the browser will load the page using mobile data.  If you do not get redirected for some reason, if you know the address of the page you are supposed to be redirected to, entering this manually sometimes works for me.  If you can manage to get redirected in the browser of your phone, you can simply enter this address on your computer as well. This worked for me just now, I had to copy an address like codehttp://10.19.0.1:3442/code. The url was actually longer, but only this first part was needed. This successfully brought me to the page where I could enter the wifi password. Somehow I had to turn wifi off and on after that (this didn't work before), but I did not have to re-enter the password fortunately.  <answer270518> I had the same problem. I tried every option that has been stated in this section but it still didn't work, then from a different forum someone said try typing www.apple.com and it worked just fine. Not sure if its a long term fix but the pop up login screen did eventually pop up.  Hope this helps  <answer288207> ol liRemove the Wifi Network/li liJoin it again/li liWhen it asks for credentials, make sure to turn off the option to remember the login./li /ol  Funny thing is that it does not go through the logon screen doing so, just the modal dialog box is displayed.  Not having looked into the details, I assume that a new logon token needs to be generated, and the remembered logon is just no good.  Another option that seems to work for me is starting up Firefox instead. Either it will come-up with a login screen, or in the banner it will instruct that a logon first might be required (clicking the button/link in the banner will redirect to the logon screen)  <answer290351> I had the same problem even on Sierra when I tried to login to public network. Network "Assist me..." didn't do the work for me. In fact, it reported the network connection was ok. I need to click the "Advanced" in Network settings and DNS tab. Hit the link under Search Domain in browser and the term page eventually showed up.   <comment255477> Thanks so much! I’ll give this a try next time I’m out with my MacBook. <comment263441> I tried the above and it hasn't worked. Realised today it's because the user I'd created before was an admin user. It HAS to be a standard user. <comment301930> Welcome to Ask Different!  Please don't give link-only answers.
