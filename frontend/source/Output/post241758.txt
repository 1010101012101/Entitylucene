Is Homebrew safe for Mac? <body> I wonder if Homebrew is safe for Mac users...  Do you have any bad experience with this software (like malware for example)?  <answer241768> Homebrew on its own acts like a command-line App Store. It's safe, if you know what you're downloading.  If you are concerned about downloading hijacked binaries, verify the SHA/SHA1 sum of the binary you've downloaded against the SHA/SHA1 sum published by the developer, usually on their webpage.  Personally, I've never had any bad experiences with Homebrew. I've explored many projects and never had any embad/em experiences.
