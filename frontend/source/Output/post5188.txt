Can I turn a Windows machine into an AirPlay destination? <body> Is there software available that'll make a Windows PC running XP appear as an AirPlay destination in my Mac's iTunes? I'd like to be able to stream audio from my Macs to a Windows machine I use as my home theater PC that's connected to my stereo.  <answer5211> Looks like AirMedia Player for Windows is made to let you do this from at least an iOS device, probably iTunes as well.   <answer6760> If you only want to stream audio, try Airfoil Speakers, part of Airfoil for Windows  <answer12995> The WiFi2HiFi app is what you are looking for. It can stream audio from any computer program to the iPhone: http://www.wifi2hifi.com  <answer14138> Here is a fast and simple open source program that works very well: http://sourceforge.net/projects/shairport4w/  <answer64919> I've found this article with a couple of solutions.   My favorite option is the Shareport. Another option not yet mentioned could be to share your iTunes library with your windows PC. See this page for more details.  <answer70420> Use airparrot to stream your windows screen to ur apple tv. http://airparrot.com  <answer245874> Reflector 2 allows you to AirPlay audio and video strongfrom/strong iOS strongto/strong Windows. It claims to support iOS 9 now also (note I personally haven't tested the iOS 9 support yet).  Reflector installs an app that acts as an AirPlay and Google Cast receiver. The app is available for Windows, Mac, Android, or Amazon Fire. Since Reflector supports receiving both AirPlay and Google Cast it can receive audio/video from iOS or Android.  It's from Squirrels, the same company that makes the excellent AirParrot app (which allows you send AirPlay audio and video strongfrom/strong Windows and Mac strongto/strong AirPlay and Google Cast).  <comment5304> cool. Checking it out now man. Thanks. <comment5305> whoa. That's some buggy software! I'll keep an eye on it, but for now it's unusable. <comment5339> Not surprised since its a new tech. I have not used it, just saw it in my RSS feeds the other day. <comment6461> Right now, no. Though I am sure there will be. AirPlay is still new and it will take a bit of time. <comment7120> Here is the [AirFoil Speakers link](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/speakers.php) and that is almost what I'm looking for. You have to be running AirFoil on the Mac (or another PC) to send audio to the AirFoil Speakers program. I'd like to not have to buy AirFoil for Mac. This is definitely the closest I've seen to a solution for my problem. <comment13696> But that's *not* what I'm looking for. Not at all. I want to stream *to* iTunes running on a *Windows PC*. Not to my iPhone. <comment76270> iTunes is as far as I know not capable of being an Airplay _client_. <comment76798> Welcome to Ask Different!
