Calendar entries do not delete automatically <body> I have a Exchange account on my iPhone (latest iOS 10.3). If a meeting is created by my organisation, I get the entries automatically in my iOS Calendar. For example, I have a meeting at 9.30 to 10 AM.I get two entries, one for meeting and second for status as Busy.  If the meeting is updated or deleted by the organisation, the meeting time updates, but the Busy status does not. The meetings are configured for 2-3 months at a time. How do I remove the Busy status for that period ?  In the below image, the calendar event has been updated from 9.30-10 to 10-10.30 AM. As you can see the status is still Busy for 9.30-10 AM.
