iTunes for macOS Skips to the next track mid-song <body> I've seen a lot of discussion about people having erroneous skips on the iOS Music app, and some fairly recent discussion on known Apple Music service outages causing the same thing.  My issue is unrelated. I do not subscribe to Apple Music.  For years, infrequently, but frequently enough for it to be bothersome, I've experienced these mid-track skips on both iTunes for macOS as well as the iOS Music app.  It's happened on my 2012 MacBook Pro. It's happened on my 2014 Mac mini. It's happened on Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, iOS 8, 9, 10. iTunes 10.x, 11.x, 12.x. (Perhaps further back on all of these.)  It's happened with purchased iTunes music, with ripped CDs, or music acquired via other means.  I've replaced a problematic album that I ripped with a download acquired via...other means. Still happens.  When I search the web, I see plenty of people talking about this, but indicating it's only happening all of a sudden or on one device, or on Apple Music.  If an album skips prematurely in iTunes, it will usually skip in iOS as well.  It's happened again today. iTunes 12.6.1.25. Sierra 10.12.5.  I've been wondering about this for years. And I've done fresh installs of macOS and iOS, so it's not a backup or data transfer carrying over some corrupt OS file.  Any thoughts?  <comment365013> Btw - iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7 Plus - same deal. <comment365015> Try re-encoding the offending track. <comment365022> is it always the same songs it happens with? <comment365032> It's any song. Get a new album, maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't. I just never know.
