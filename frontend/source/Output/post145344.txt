How do I create a new iCloud account? <body> Hi I would like to ask how do I create a new iCloud account for my iPad Mini. I forgot my old one. How can I do this?  <answer145362> Just visit https://appleid.apple.com/account on mobile Safari and fill in the required fields. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W7evq.png" alt="apple id creation form"  <comment171277> Recovering it via https://iforgot.apple.com/ might be the easier way, did you try that already?
