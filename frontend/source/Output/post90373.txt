iPhone 4 operates only with WiFi connectivity abroad <body> Can iPhone 4 operates using WiFi connectivity only when the cellular service is cancelled?  <answer90375> In short, yes, it should perform normally for you even when you don't have data enabled.  Your iPhone 4 can connect to a Wi-Fi network whenever Wi-Fi is turned on and there is a Wi-Fi network within the range of your device. Wi-Fi connectivity is independent from Cellular connectivity. You can turn Wi-Fi ON or OFF (in Settings.app - Wifi) and you can also turn Cellular ON or OFF (Settings.app - General - Cellular - Cellular Data) independently.   If you are internationally abroad and you want to keep your device from connecting to a Cellular network, turn off "Data Roaming" in Settings - General - Cellular.  <comment106096> Are you asking if it can operate as a phone? Note that with the phone service cancelled, you don't have a phone number. So you can use it as you would an ipod touch, and even do calls with skype, facetime, or other, but it won't be a phone.
