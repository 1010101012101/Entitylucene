Can I tag a file from Quick Look? <body> I'd be able to very quickly tag a bunch of photos for later processing.  <answer123083> The Tags feature in Findersup1/sup already has a keyboard shortcut which can be activated whilst in Quick Look. strongPress ⌘⇧T to set a tag/strong on the currently selected file.  hr  To set a custom shortcut…  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongShortcuts/strong → strongApp Shortcuts/strong./li liClick the strong+/strong button to add a new shortcut./li liSet the strongApplication/strong to strongFinder.app/strong, and the strongMenu Title/strong to strongTags…/strong./li liSet your keyboard shortcut and press strongAdd/strong./li /ol  supsup1/sup As this is a feature of Finder, not Quick Look, the modal popup may be behind the Quick Look window./sup  <comment143675> I assigned a keyboard shortcut to "Tags..." from the File menu in Finder. I can hit the shortcut while in Quick View to tag the file quickly. It also works for multi-file tagging, so you can tag multiple files at once. Let me know if this does what you need. I can provide steps on how to achieve this. <comment143695> That did it, thanks, especially since Quick Look remembers its screen position, so placing it off to the side ensures it doesn't obstruct the tagging window in Finder.
