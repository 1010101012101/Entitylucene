iPad app for tabular data editing <body> I'm looking for a very simple iPad app for editing of tabular data -- like a Spreadsheet program but I don't need any computation functions or formatting. I just need to edit the values of rows and columns. Even a "personal database" app might work, but I'm really going for something with minimal interface.  The Sheets component of the Google Drive app does exactly what I need except it doesn't work offline.  Any ideas? Think barebones and minimal.  <comment134142> Software recommendations are typically discouraged (I've been told that several times, I should know!) but you might just want to try Numbers. It's a bit more than you're asking for but it should work. <comment134143> Which apps did you already look at in the App Store and why do these not fit your needs? If you could add this to the question, it would make it easier for everybody to propose different solutions
