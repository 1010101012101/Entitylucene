How do I exit out of low power mode on an iPhone/iPod Touch? <body> I entered low power mode on my iDevice and the battery level indicator turned yellow. Now I've plugged it in and it's up past 23% and the battery is still yellow. Does that mean I'm in Low Power Mode still? How do I get out of Low Power Mode? Update: It's at 55% and it's still yellow.   Also, let's say I enter Low Power Mode accidentally, it pops up that alert dialog awfully fast sometimes. If I entered low power mode on accident but don't want to be in it how do I exit out of it then?   <answer207215> Go to Settings - Battery - Disable Low Power Mode  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3VnJE.jpg" width="320" height="568"  Low Power Mode will also turn off automatically once your device has been charged up to 80%.  <answer207225> You can also use Siri to turn Low Power Mode on and off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fa8dX.jpg" alt=""  <answer230472> Settings, battery, low power mode, off  <answer247574> Settings- Battery - slide bar to turn it off  <answer251484> Settings- Battery - Low Power Mode  <comment249886> If you leave the iPhone charging with the Low Power Mode enabled, it will automatically disable it when it reaches a sustainable level of battery. Around 85% I think but I'm not sure though. <comment249887> Ok thanks dorito. I'll plug it in and monitor it's progress. <comment249888> As corrected by @jroschen, "Low Power Mode will automatically turn off at 80%" <comment250009> But what happens if battery is 51% as in picture - it still looks like it is in Low Power mode. The question is how to get it out of that mode <comment250011> @Mark One can just use Siri to turn it off, as well. <comment281318> Can you elaborate? <comment281327> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.

That's the fastest way as of today I guess <comment293583> I prefer the form factor of the iPhone SE, thank you. <comment305515> Welcome to Ask Different.
