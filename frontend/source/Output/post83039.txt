Check keychain availability <body> I would like to test if a keychain is there and if so mount a server disk. How can check if a keychain is there or not in a script?  Thanks for your help.  <comment95729> What kind of script are you looking for, Applescript or shell script? Applescript access to keychain entries is covered in http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/9508/9058 already, would this solve your problem as well? <comment99169> Yes, thanks that might work...
