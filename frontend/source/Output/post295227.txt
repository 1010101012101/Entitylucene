Is there a Siri command for "Get directions to my next event?" <body> I can say to Siri "Get directions to the nearest post office" and it will pull it up. However, sometimes I am on my way to an event that is in my calendar with the address. I would like to say "Get directions to my next event". However, that doesn't work as it pulls up event centers instead.  Is there some other phrasing I can say to express what I want to Siri?  <answer296289> This is impossible to do as of iOS 10.3.3. About the closest thing you can do is, code"Hey Siri where is my next appointment"/code, but there is no way to get directions from the address it spits out.   What I'd recommend, instead of using Siri, is to create a widget in Workflow that will automatically grab the next event's location and give you directions. emNote: I have never used Workflow to do this myself but I'm 99% sure it has all the various actions you would need to write a workflow to give you directions with one click./em  Sorry you are unable to use Siri in this way and hopefully Workflow will accomplish what you're looking to do.
