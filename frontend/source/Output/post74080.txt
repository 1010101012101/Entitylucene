kextstat-Listed Files Not Present in Extensions Folder <body> I used "kextstat | grep -v com.apple" to find active extensions, and found the following listed extensions.  precode  119    3 0xffffff7f826c7000 0x3e000    0x3e000    org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv (3.2.4) &lt;7 5 4 3 1&gt;   121    0 0xffffff7f8196c000 0x8000     0x8000     org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB (3.2.4) &lt;119 35 28 7 5 4 3 1&gt; /code/pre  I want to unload them with kextunload in order to reduce kernel memory usage, but there are not any org.virtualbox.kext.* files present in my /System/Library/Extensions/ directory. Any suggestions on how I can find where these are being stored and unload them?  <answer74086> VirtualBox puts their kexts into code/Library/Extensions/code just as they should be. No third party should put anything into code/Systemâ€¦/code if it's not absolutely necessary to do so.  <comment86109> Aha! Thanks. (Duh!) I checked /Users/me/Library but not /Library. Found 'em.
