Devices in OS X Internet Sharing can't see each other <body> I really like the feature of OS X to share it's Ethernet connection over WiFi to other devices. But it appears that those devices are unable to "see" each other (e.g. you can't play a LAN game with two iDevices). I ensured that my firewall is disabled and that IP forwarding is enabled (codesysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1/code and codesysctl -w net.inet.ip.fw.enable=1/code). Still, no possibility for those two devices to connect. Is it unnecessary to enable IP forwarding? Is there a possibility to enable this behaviour?  <comment294121> struggling with same issue... so far no solution :-(
