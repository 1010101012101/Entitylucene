Adjust horizontal scrolling speed on a non-apple mouse <body> I have recently bought a Logitech M510 as my main mouse switching over from a magic mouse. I didn't realize missing horizontal scrolling would be such an issue, but apparently it is.   Now a mac does support horizontal scrolling by holding shift + scrolling, this is however amazingly slow.   I have the Logitech Control Center installed, which offers a few extra options, but nothing regarding the horizontal scroll speed. The scrolling speed options offered there only affect vertical scrolling.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/snAdT.png" alt="settings screenshot"  Is there anything that can be done about this?  <answer259360> have you tried increasing the speed in Accessibility options?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3rtqE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment324568> Not a bad idea. Since I haven't used the mouse in question (or anything similar) for over two years, I can't really say if this would solve it. Thanks nonetheless for the answer! <comment324646> Just saw that you asked this two years ago. I was just browsing unanswered questions. I hope your Logitech journey has been better than mine.
