What's a good, actively-developed status-bar-hosted mail client? <body> I currently use Notify, but it has gone out from under active development and there are a few bugs in Lion. Is there something that does an identical or nearly identical thing, but hasn't been abandoned? Free would be preferable.  <answer41545> Sparrow is $10 on the MAS and does have a status-bar only option.
