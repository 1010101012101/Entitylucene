Really switch among all the applications by shortcuts <body> I am using Mac OS X 10.7.3. kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdtab/kbd is used to switch among different applications, but sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I guess it is because some applications are hidden or minimized.  Is there a way to strongreally/strong switch among all the applications by shortcuts no matter whether they are hidden or minimized?   <answer49457> If you use kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdtab/kbd to go through your open applications, you should see even minimized ones, but if you select them, they don't automatically maximize/unminize. If you however press the kbdoption/kbd key emafter/em you've selected the desired minimized application but embefore releasing/em the kbd&#x2318;/kbd key with kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdtab/kbd, the app window that was minimized to the dock will return to its previous view.  I know this probably isn't exactly what you're looking for, but perhaps it'll help nonetheless.  Following this tip should also create a window for apps with no active window (works for Mail, iTunes and Keynote).  You can also switch from an app to "itself" (by hitting kbdshift/kbd+kbdtab/kbd once) then holding option before letting go of command will unminimize or create the window.  <answer49574> Alternatively, you could try one of the following add ons:  http://manytricks.com/witch/  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/8242/liteswitch-x (company website no longer seems to exist)  Both apps claim to solve the minimized app problem.  <comment56648> Sorry, I tried the `option` key after I've selected the desired minimized application... but it still does not appear... <comment56694> owenfi made some changes to my post to make it clearer, did you see the changes?
