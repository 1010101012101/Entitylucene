Apple Script : Remove space / line in variable <body> I'm using applescript to collect a lost of number from a website, and my script is working fine, I just get a lot of space and a line between the result which I can't figure out how to get rid of.  precodeset numbersList to my getInputByClass2("sortable numPersonId", 1)   to getInputByClass2(theClass)      tell application "Safari"         set r to do JavaScript "var outPut=[]; var arr=document.getElementsByClassName('" &amp; theClass &amp; "');for (var i in arr) {outPut.push(arr[i].innerHTML)};outPut;" in document 1     end tell     return strings of r --- this remove all 'Missing Value' from a list of strings end getInputByClass2  set goodresult to items 2 thru -1 of numbersList as string  set theText to goodresult set {tid, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, " "} set temp to text items of theText set AppleScript's text item delimiters to " " -- or use " " if you want to delete spaces set theText to temp as text set AppleScript's text item delimiters to tid /code/pre  the result will be :  precode                                9990607901                                    8228210011                                    1555508116 /code/pre  when I expect to have:  9990607901  8228210011br  1555508116  or 9990607901, 8228210011 ,  1555508116  <answer245908> This isn't beautiful but it works-- you can probably clean it up. I commented things so you'll know what I was up to. Add this to the end of your existing script-- it start with the result you were already getting ("theText").  You have two problems to clean up: blank lines, and blanks (spaces) on either side of non-blank characters. The script below takes care of both.  precodeset the_new_list to {} set the_new_string to ""  -- starting with your current result-- "theText"  --the below was practice --set theText to "     --      9990607901 -- -- -- --                                8228210011      -- -- -- --                                1555508116 --"  -- put the text into a list set the_paragraphs to paragraphs of theText  -- loop through the items in the list repeat with a_paragraph in the_paragraphs     set the_new_string to ""     set my_string to a_paragraph as string     -- check for blank lines and skip/discard     if my_string is "" then         --do nothing     else         -- check for blanks surrounding non-blanks and remove         repeat with a_character in (characters of my_string)             if text of a_character = " " then                 --do nothing             else                 set the_new_string to (the_new_string &amp; text of a_character)             end if         end repeat         -- now we have a clean, non-blank item for our new list         if the_new_string is "" then             --do nothing         else             set end of the_new_list to the_new_string         end if     end if end repeat -- set text_for_the_clipboard to "" repeat with an_item in the_new_list     set text_for_the_clipboard to text_for_the_clipboard &amp; text of an_item &amp; return end repeat set the clipboard to text_for_the_clipboard /code/pre  Best of luck. This should do it for you.  <comment307732> that's great thank you, the only thing is I can't set the clipboard to the_new_list for some reason, but I have a better look in a minute <comment308002> I updated the script to include steps to set the clipboard. All you have to do is click where you want to paste, and paste. I had given you a list, which you can't paste. I converted the list that looked like this: {item 1, item 2, item 3} to a stack that looks like this: item 1 (return) item 2 (return) item 3 (return) etc.
