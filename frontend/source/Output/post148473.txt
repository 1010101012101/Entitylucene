Reclaim Delete freespace Partition after Yosemite removal <body> Many of you face the same issue , that you install Yosemite in a second partition and once you decided to remove Yosemite and go back to Mavericks, you are not able to claim the Freespace partition in the Disk Utility as shown in the below image.  http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z472/luv2rip/ATV1/DiskUtility_zps820af6b8.png  I read lot of blogs and tried different commands, screwed my disk completely couple of times , but finally got it fixed.  Here is what I did:  ol liReboot your Mac in Recovery mode using Command+R key combination during the boot up./li liStart terminal application from the recovery boot/li liRun command, diskutil cs list/li liYou will see output similar to shown below/li /ol  http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z472/luv2rip/ATV1/diskutil_zps00b313c7.png  See the last Logical Volume name, 76A3020B-B3C2-4905-9E09-2EBB5470261C  Use that in next command.  ol start="5" lidiskutil cs revert 76A3020B-B3C2-4905-9E09-2EBB5470261C/li /ol  This should convert the CoreService Logical Volume to a Normal Disk partition.  ol start="6" liRun command, diskutil cs list now, and you should receive message that no CS volumes./li liNow, Reboot your MacOSX normally and once you login, start Disk Utility and resize your main partition "Machintosh HD" to claim all free space./li /ol  Hope this helps. Let me know if any questions.  Thanks sapzolls  <comment174878> It appears you've asked and answered a question in the same post. You're allowed (in fact, even encouraged by some) to answer your own question, but you need to post the question as a question, *then* post the answer in response to your question, not with the question and answer together in the question section. <comment208928> This helped me. Thanks! <comment237650> This is exactly my problem too. So yeah, really nice to see it here even if it isn't in the standard format.  :) <comment237660> Well I tried it but no luck.  :( <comment246516> Super helpful, but use the correct format next time!
