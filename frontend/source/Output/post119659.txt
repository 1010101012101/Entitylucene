Can't register new App ID <body> I'm trying to register a new App ID inside iTunes connect web site, but when I've filled out the details and hit continue, it just comes up "Loading" and stays like that, any ideas?  <answer119799> This happened to me one time too. I would check my internet connection first. Internet connection problem is something that happens frequently. After that i would go over all the information that you provided and see if there is a mistake somewhere.  <answer119863> Just for anyone else with the same issue. I tried another browser and it worked fine, so it's some kind of browser issue.  <answer198389> This was happening to me because I was using Safari "Private mode". When I turned back to "Non Private Mode" the problem was solved  <answer208716> I had AdBlock Plus and Ghostery running. Disabling both allowed it to work for me.  <comment175039> omg I can't believe that it was that. In Chrome it got stuck but in Safari would work fine
