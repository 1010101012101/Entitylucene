How to temporary block any internet communications of iPhone? <body> Is it possible to press some button and temporary turn iPhone into normal phone, i.e. make it transmit nothing over data channel?  I have such button on Android -- to disable "mobile data". Can I do the same on iOS?  <answer136329> You can turn off all data transfer over the mobile network by disabling Settings-Cellular-Cellular Data. It still does WiFi then, which you can disable with Settings-Wi-Fi.  Alternatively, you can disable all communications by activating Airplane mode.  <answer136334> Once "Airplane mode" is activated, you can selectively re-enable WiFi and/or BlueTooth.  I keep my iPad in "Airplane mode" with WiFi enabled, so as not to accidentally burn through my limited data plan.
