How to synchronize password with macbook safari and iphone3gs safari? <body> I would like to use the password generated by my macbook safari while I am using my iPhone 3gs safari...  Is that possible somehow?  <answer136567> Unfortunately, there's no way to sync Safari passwords with an iPhone 3GS. iCloud Keychain syncing requires iOS7, which in turn requires an iPhone 4 or later.
