Using two keyboards, different layouts <body> I use two keyboards on the mac, the default mac keyboard and a windows default (Microsoft wireless desktop).  I use the strongmicrosoft keyboard one for the left hand/strong, and the strongmac keyboard for the right hand/strong.  The problem is that when I press a key on microsoft keyboard like kbdshift/kbd/kbdctrl/kbd/kbdalt/kbd/kbdesc/kbd, and another key on the mac it strongdoesn't get detected as a combination/strong. I have to press the full combination on the same keyboard.  strongIs it possible to override this?/strong  I'm used to typing kbd&#x21E7;/kbd (Keyboard A) and kbdchar/kbd (Keyboard B) in order to get an upper case char.  <answer36194> The Mac won't do key combinations across keyboards, even with an Apple external and a MacBook Pro internal.   I know of no utility to allow this, either.
