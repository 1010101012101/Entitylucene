iTunes Store Doesn't Recognize iTunes Library <body> About two weeks ago, iTunes stopped recognizing my iTunes library. I get this message when I go to either strongFile/strong → strongLibrary/strong → strongUpdate iCloud Music Library/strong or strongUpdate Genius/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1eHQl.png" alt="iTunes Store Doesn’t Recognize iTunes Library"  There is no such option under strongFile/strong → strongLibrary/strong. I tried disabling emGenius Recommendations/em under my account, then turning them back on, but with no success. What is causing this and how can I fix it?  I have iTunes Match, but not Apple Music, if that matters.  <answer250093> Logging out of my iTunes account and logging back in did the trick.  ul listrongAccount/strong → strongSign Out/strong/li listrongiTunes/strong → strongQuit iTunes/strong/li liWait a bit, relaunch iTunes/li listrongAccount/strong → strongSign In/strong/li listrongiTunes/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongGeneral/strong → emuncheck/em codeiCloud Music Library/code/li liClick OK, wait a bit/li listrongiTunes/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongGeneral/strong → emcheck/em codeiCloud Music Library/code/li /ul  iTunes should immediately start updating your strongiCloud Music Library/strong. Once that’s done, everything should be working correctly.  <comment336535> Wish I could give 1000 upvotes. I've been searching for this info forever. No help at all from Apple.
