Device Management from WAN with no VPN <body> We're setting up about a dozen mac mini's across the city that need to be managed from a central lion-server.  Our IT department is willing to open up some ports and forward them to our lion server but they are not willing to give us VPN access.  What ports do I need to forward to the mini server in order to manage the devices?  ul liI'm thinking mostly of when I update a profile and need it to be pushed out to the other devices.  /li liI also need each device to be able to authenticate via Open Directory when the machine is remote. Of course I'll setup "mobility" but I still need the machines to sync changes like new passwords when they "can" connect.  /li liLastly, I'd like to be able to connect FROM the server TO each Mac mini via Apple remote-desktop. (The machines will not have static IP addresses on their side.)/li /ul  <answer37124> Looking at the apple support page, I've discovered that   ul liOpen Directory runs on port 625./li liPassword server runs on port 106./li liProfile Manager runs on port 1640 &amp; 2195./li liRemote Desktop runs on port 3283./li liPush Notifications run on port 2196./li liSimple Authentication runs on port 3659./li liBonjour runs on port 5353./li liSoftware update service runs on port 8088./li liNetboot runs on ports 67 &amp; 68./li /ul
