OS X Mavericks upgrade - disk/partition failure <body> I'm on OS X Lion on my Mac, I have downloaded OS X Mavericks and executed the upgrade.  My Mac restarted and executed the upgrade process, but after a few minutes the update stopped because my OS disk partition "My Macintosh HD" is corrupted. So I tried to check and fix the disk using codeDisk Utility/code but with no luck.  Can I stop the upgrade process and execute my current OS X Lion again, then copy my files, and make a clean new setup? I can't find any way to do that.  <answer106758> I had this and I found that I had to have codeDisk Utility/code repair both the codedisk/code (top level in the tree) and the codepartition/code (second level).  <answer107294> I tried some solutions, but I can't find any secure way to stop the update setup without delete the Mac partition.  The only working solution was to make a clean install.  So:  ul liI saved much data possible using a bootcamp Win 7 working partition/li lithen I have restored my last, but old, version (1 years ago!!) on my machine from Time Machine/li lifrom the restoed machine I have downloaded Mavericks, and make a bootable USB setup key/li lilast I reset the Mac partition and start the setup for a clean install/li /ul  Now it's working fine, and fortunately, I haven't lost anything.  <comment125279> Thank, I'll give a try to it ASAP
