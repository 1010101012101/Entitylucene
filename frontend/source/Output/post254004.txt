Opening apps at the left of the dock <body> My dock is organized with more commonly used apps at the left side. I would like, that when an app (not already in the dock) is opened, it should show up on the emleft/em and not on the right. Is this possible?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfNsq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer254017> Unfortunately not. You can only change the position of the dock, but not where 'undocked' apps appear.  The only solution I can think of is to move the active application to the first position. This, however, will add the application permanently to the dock.
