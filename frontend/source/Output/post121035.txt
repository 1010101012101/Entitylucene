iPhone 3 passcode locked, display unreadable, unable to enter code <body> My iPhone 3 fell 9 stories and did not crack the screen but the display is really messed up and there are photos that I really need.  Since the screen is un readable I am unable to enter my passcode.  Is there anyway to get the pictures?    I am unable to backup also because of the password issue.  I have been struggling with this for months.  <comment141075> My suggestion would be to take it to a local repair shop. Plenty abound on CraigsList and are very cheap, especially for older generation iPhones. Amazon sells the digitizer kit for $10: http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-3gS-Screen-Repair-Kit/dp/B002XT355S And you can pick up a screen for $15: http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Display-Screen-Replacement/dp/B003SMOWHY/ref=pd_sim_cps_1 You probably don't even need to install it properly, just enough to get the screen working so you can remove the Lock Screen passcode.
