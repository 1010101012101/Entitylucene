How can I manually change my dropbox folder location when it won't show in the chooser <body> When trying to choose a dropbox folder location, the folder I want to use is not visible in the file chooser dialog. I can see the folder in finder and terminal. I recently copied my home folder to a new disk but Dropbox has kept the original path to codeUsers/me/dropbox/code  Has anyone done this manually? Is it enough to change code~/.dropbox/info.json/code?  folder permissions are :  precodedrwxr-xr-x@ 86 myusername  staff  2924 29 Jun 19:43 foldername /code/pre  ls -le:  precodedrwxr-xr-x@ 86 myname  staff  2924 29 Jun 19:43 foldername  0: group:everyone deny delete /code/pre  <comment161924> Why won't it show in the chooser? Is it a hidden folder? <comment161933> What are the permissions on the new folder? <comment161935> Its not a hidden folder. I've updated the question with the permissions. <comment161936> Can you do ls -le to show the folder permissions - as there is an @ in your output there are also extended attributes
