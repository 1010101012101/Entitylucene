MacBook Pro SSD boot issues <body> So I have a MacBook Pro (Late '12), has run seamlessly with all OSes that I have put on it, (not to say that this problem is due to the OS). (I'm trying to be as detailed as possible so bear with me.)  (Side note: I posted this exact same question in the Apple discussions but no one could answer my question.) The other day I simply opened up Finder and went to my movies folder which is housed on my 2TB Time Capsule that I connect to wirelessly. After taking the usual 5 seconds or so to pull up this particular folder, Finder stops responding so I do what any tech-savvy person does: pull up Terminal to kill Finder's process. Normally Terminal will login as your user, this time however, it somehow gets stuck on the login part, simply displaying 'login:'. Won't let me type or anything. I shut down the MBP and boot it up to find a flashing folder with a question mark on it. Okay, that's fine. Plug in an external with OS X Utilities and Recovery on it, attempt to verify my internal SSD which fails, giving me      error code 8   After doing this for some time I assume there's something wrong with the partition table, and at this point I don't care if I lose my documents I just want my SSD bootable again. I go into another external that I have with Yosemite on it, and partition my internal into two partions: DJ OS (I DJ as well) and Mac OS. I try to install Yosemite on to DJ OS but to no avail. I go back to my 2nd external and run codefsck_hfs -fy /dev/disk0s2/code I am a CECS major (Freshman) so I usually know what I'm doing, but hard drives and their well-being is nooot my thing, so this just perplexed me:  precodeSams-MacBook-Pro:/ user$ sudo fsck_hfs -fy /dev/disk0s2   ** /dev/rdisk0s2 (NO WRITE)      Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-285).   ** Verifying volume when it is mounted with write access.   fsck_hfs: pread(5, 0x7fab2c00f200, 114176, 6542336): Input/output error      Journal need to be replayed but volume is read-only   ** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.

This is what I get:  precodeVerify and Repair volume “DJ OS” Repairing file system. Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume. Checking extents overflow file. The volume DJ OS could not be verified completely. File system check exit code is 8. Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required. Error: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files. /code/pre  What concerns me is that is says it is corrupt and needs to be repaired, my problem is that every time I repair it in Disk Utility I get an error code and it tells me it can't repair it. So all in all, I have a corrupt internal SSD, which refuses to be repaired by Disk Utility. Please help!!

If you have a current, complete backup of the system, the easiest solution here is to boot to recovery mode, open Disk Utility and erase the partition. With a fresh file system in place, exit Disk Utility and proceed to restore from the TC backup.  Note: If you have successfully backed up corrupted files, you will also successfully restore them. If the system continues to exhibit strange behaviour even when DU indicates no file system problems and hardware test is clear, you'll probably want to consider a fresh OS install and a profile/data/apps migration. (Within the last week, I went through this exact scenario courtesy of a corruption in the encrypted volume that made it unbootable.)  <comment198385> I'm sorry I should have specified this, but I do not use the TC for backups. I use it for storing all of my multimedia files due to my internal's small store capacity. <comment198470> If you don't have a backup, there's not much help to offer here. Backups are the essential component in a recovery strategy. <comment198512> I'm not looking to recover any data at this point, I just want to be able to clean up the drive so that I can install an OS onto it without getting I/O errors. <comment241619> Did you figure this out? I just bought a brand new SSD Drive to replace one that I think failed. When trying to install 10.10.4 from a USB drive, I get the same errors you were getting.
