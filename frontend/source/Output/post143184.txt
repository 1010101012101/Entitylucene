Can you tell if updates came from OS X caching server? <body> If I run software update on a Mavericks Mac it will find a caching server automagically if there are any running locally rather than using the CDN Apple hosts on the internet. I'm not so much concerned about security as just knowing when and if the server is running correctly without having any sort of log in to the server itself.  Is there a log file on the client end or another way to determine this conclusively?  <answer143260> The caching server will print to log when a client requests an update. This log is located at:  precode/Library/Server/Caching/Logs/Debug.log /code/pre  The following is the anatomy of a request which was served by the caching server's cache:  ul liClient requests update package  precodeGot request for host = http://swcdn.apple.com/{{REQUEST}} /code/pre/li liFind cached package in server data  precodeInitializing asset handler for http://swcdn.apple.com/{{REQUEST}} (path = /Library/Server/Caching/Data/{{UDID}}) /code/pre/li liCheck/load asset in cache  precodeCached asset length = {{LENGTH}} MD5={{CHECKSUM}} last modified {{DATE/TIME}} Extents loaded from disk: {{DATA}} Data already cached for asset http://swcdn.apple.com/{{REQUEST}}, issuing If-Modified-Since request Info loaded: file length = {{DATA}}, reader = {{DATA}} /code/pre/li liServe asset to client from cache  precode{{BYTES}} bytes served, {{SERVED_BYTES}} from cache, 0 downloaded /code/pre  This code0 downloaded/code is what shows the update was entirely served by the caching server./li liFinish  precodeOutgoing connection finished /code/pre/li /ul  <answer219932> I'm not sure on which version this stat became available, but in codeversion 5.0.15/code you can see a graph of the data served by the caching service:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VvPDg.png" alt="Caching service statistic graph"  <comment168731> This would be great except for the ***"without having any sort of log in to the server itself"*** requirement. <comment168735> @bmike Totally missed that in the question… I'll look into it again tomorrow (UTC) <comment168736> It is worth keeping that answer since for many it will be the ideal solution. If you find another, queue up a second answer :) <comment168822> As far as I know, this is meant to be invisible to the end user... happy to be proven wrong on this. <comment168871> I'm hoping I don't have to use `lsof` to record open network ports while the update is running, but hopefully someone has some insight on how this works or perhaps a debug setting to get this logged. We will see in time perhaps. <comment169067> A simple way to allow access without too much fuss and risks would be to activate "Websites" services and add an alias (eg path /Logs/Server/Caching folder /Library/Server/Caching/Logs)... You may also add "Debug.log" as an Index File... <comment169068> Nothing's 'standing out' in the client logs so far; looking at network traffic would be cumbersome though… <comment169073> @GeorgeGarside I wonder if debug mode would help? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17816/does-the-lion-app-store-have-a-debug-menu <comment169076> This is exactly what I was in the process of doing! :) Now to find a VM with a pending update to test… <comment266341> Exactly - the server log is much more detailed than the aggregate graph. The reason I'm asking about determining updates on the client end is to correlate and match the activity I see from the server as well as know when an update happened on the client side when I have no access to the server.
