iTunes is not showing device backups - can't restore backup <body> In iTunes (12.3 on Windows), clicking  Edit  Preferences...  Device tab  shows an empty list of backups even though there should be a bunch of them.  I needed to get my phone replaced, so I backed up my phone last night, took it to Apple today and got a replacement. In trying to restore the new phone from the backup, iTunes never offered the option - it would just say "Welcome to your new iPhone" with a Continue button.  No matter what I did, it would never offer the option to restore from a previous backup. So I selected Continue and it set it up as a new phone. The options to restore from a previous Backup were greyed out. I tried various suggestions from the internet with no luck - for example, doing a backup and then holding down shift when clicking the Restore button without any luck.  <answer222898> One of the backup folders was causing a problem.  Here is where the backups are stored:  On Windows at code%AppData%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\/code  On Mac it's at code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/code  Here's what to do:  ol liMove all the folders in the Backup folder to a different location/li liMove a single folder back (I did it in reverse chronological order)/li liClick on Edit  Preferences  Device tab to see if the backups show in the list/li liRepeat 2 and 3 until you get an empty list - you've found the bad backup folder (or at least a backup that the newer iTunes can't understand)/li liDelete or move that bad backup/li /ol  In my case, it was an old iPad 1 iOS5 backup that was causing the problem.
