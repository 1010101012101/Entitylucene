Will updating from 10.10 Yosemite to 10.12 Sierra lead to backwards compatibility issues <body> My main Mac is a late 2012 Mac Mini, currently running 10.10.5.   I also have a late 2008 Aluminium MacBook, recently updated to 10.11.6 El Capitan (the newest version it will support).  And an iPad 3 (original Retina) running whatever the latest iOS version it supports is (probably iOS 9.3.5).  My Mac Mini is clamouring to be updated to 10.12 Sierra but I recall the last major update I did, there was some step forward in iCloud which meant devices running older versions of macOS and iOS would not be able to use iCloud once I updated - I'm fuzzy on the details but a little nervous that something similar may happen - being able to share GarageBand projects over iCloud,etc, is quite handy.  Can anyone tell me if it is the case that iCloud versions or other OS incompatibility issues could arise, ideally with a bit of background info or links where I can get a better understanding? I can imagine that the future version of macOS with the new filesystem might well do, but I don't know how long my Mac Mini will be supported anyway!
