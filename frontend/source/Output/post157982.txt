Minimize graphic effects for better performance? <body> My computer becomes extremely slow when I connect TWO 27-inch thunderbold screens to it - a Macbook Pro Late 2013 (16Gb Ram/2.7 quad-core/Yosomite 10.10.1). I am suspecting that the graphic card (NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB) isn't strong enough to drive the 3 screens (including the built-in Retina).  I am looking for a way to minimize all graphic effects to speed my computer up.  Anyone have a (possible) solution?  Thanks in advance for reading and providing with suggestions.  Best.   <answer158037> You can go to system preferences, accessibility, display and check reduce transparencyimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKgjt.png" alt="accessibility" brYou can also lower the resolution on the external monitors in the system preferences,displays menu.br and make sure automatic graphic switching is turned on in system preferences, energy saverimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERrU6.png" alt="energy saver"brAnd try setting the wallpaper to a solid color.  <comment215802> Thank you.
