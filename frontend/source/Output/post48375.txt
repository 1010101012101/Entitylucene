Converting pitches in audio to MIDI <body> I want to hum a tune and have the notes be converted into MIDI notes… is this possible?  <answer48408> I don't have Logic installed right now, but it should have something like that built in. Just select Audio to Score… from the context menu for an audio clip, see Advanced Functions in Logic Pro 8 : How to Use Factory Audio to Score in Logic Pro 8.  <answer131522> It is possible. Here’s how to do it in Logic Pro X (where it’s different from earlier versions):  ol lirecord an audio clip to an audio track/li lidouble-click the clip to view it in the Editor panel/li liclick the Show/Hide Flex button near the top left of the editor window, to the right of the menus  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZJyl1.png" alt="Show/Hide Flex button at the top left of the Editor in Logic Pro X"/li liYou will be asked ‘Do you want to turn on Flex for track “Audio 1”?’. Confirm “Turn on Flex”./li lichange the Flex pop-up menu at the top of the Editor from “Flex Time – Automatic (Slicing)” to “Flex Pitch”/li liright-click the audio area and choose “Set all to Perfect Pitch”  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4SGYu.png" alt="“Set all to Perfect Pitch” in the Flex Pitch editor’s context menu"/li lifrom the Edit menu of the Editor area, choose “Create MIDI Track from Flex Pitch Data”, at the bottom  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w8Z45.png" alt="“Create MIDI Track from Flex Pitch Data” in the Edit menu in the Flex Pitch editor"/li /ol  This will generate a MIDI region with the notes Logic can detect from your audio. You can delete your audio track now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KVKB7.png" alt="generated MIDI track below the original audio track"  You will probably want to quantize your notes too, which makes notes start on the beat. You can do this by viewing the generated MIDI region in the Editor panel, selecting all of the notes, and choosing a beat size in Time Quantize at the left. Or you could do it earlier in the process, with the Time Quantize section next to the Flex Pitch editor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EAC0K.png" alt="Time Quantize in the Editor panel when editing the generated MIDI region"  <comment293840> can you do it directly without having to record? as soon as I hum a song it goes straight to midi. thank you <comment293941> @MarcoAlexandre Sorry, I don’t think Logic Pro X supports any simpler way. At best, you could write a script in [SikuliX](http://www.sikuli.org/) that would automate the steps above by pressing keys and clicking for you. (You couldn’t write such a script with [AppleScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript) because Logic Pro X doesn’t expose the necessary functions in its Scripting Dictionary.)
