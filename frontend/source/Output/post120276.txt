What permissions to host website for OS X Server? <body> I am trying to install Dropplet on my Mavericks Server. I have created the site in Server and copied the files to the root directory.  When I go to configure it, I get the following error, "It seems that your config folder is not writable, please add the necessary permissions.".  I believe it comes from this line,  precode// Check if the install directory is writable. $is_writable = (TRUE == is_writable(dirname(__FILE__) . '/')); /code/pre  I have searched all over for what owner/group/permissions are needed for a website so Apache can write to it.  Anyone encountered this?  <answer120279> This seems to have worked: http://francoisdeschenes.com/2013/02/26/enable-write-permissions-for-apache-built-into-mac-os-x  Strange that this is not on by default?  <comment140296> Maybe reading through this might solve your problem. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114037/does-apache-require-special-settings-to-run-a-command <comment198546> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.
