Is it normal Mountain Lion behaviour to save changes in Preview without asking? <body> I just opened an image in Preview, selected a rectangle, hit delete and then quit Preview. Now I have a grey rectangle missing from the middle of my image but at no point did I get a chance to say whether or not I wanted to save my changes.  Is this normal?  (I made the edit just to have a quick play with Preview, see what it can do. Needless to say I'm not impressed)  <answer68701> Yeah, Preview has supported auto-save since 10.7.  The general preference pane has an option to ask to keep changes when closing documents. It can also be applied to individual applications:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview NSCloseAlwaysConfirmsChanges -bool true /code/pre  You can also disable auto-save and Versions completely:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview ApplePersistence -bool false /code/pre  <comment79811> Don't have access to a Mac right now, but shouldn't there be a "Revert" command in the File menu as well? <comment79824> It even has "Revert To" with a submenu showing all versions. <comment79825> System Preferences  General  Ask to keep changes when closing documents
