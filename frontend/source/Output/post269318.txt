Watch still showing birthdays <body> I have a Series 2 with watchOS 3.1.  As shown in the screenshot below, I have birthdays turned off for the calendar app. However, they are still showing in the scroll view.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GREq2.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I rid my watch of birthday events?  <comment338416> The birthdays that appear in scroll view, do they have the little red birthday present beside them signifying that that is in fact where they are populating from? Not say, a previous sync with Facebook or a user-created reoccurring calendar event? <comment338439> @NYKg yep. I wouldn't be asking otherwise.
