Exponential PDF File Size in Preview <body> I have word document (.docx on a mac) at 3.4 MB. When I save it to PDF it becomes a whomping 90 MB. I can't make it smaller and I can't figure out why it's happening. Here are the details:  ol liI've tried to convert it to PDF through: save as pdf, print -- open as pdf -- save, print -- save as PDF./li liI've done the PostScript work around and it did not help/li liI've used the quartz filter to reduce file size, it did not help/li liI've used websites to compress the PDF, they did not help/li liI've copied and pasted to a new word document, same thing happened./li liThe document has very few photos and things. It's 120 pages, mostly just text in Calibri, with a table of contents and page breaks./li listrongI have an old version of this file at 3 MB, PDF at 4 MB. When I open the old version and save it as PDF, it jumps to 75 MB./strong WHAT IS HAPPENING./li liOther computers have had the same problem with it saving at 90 MB./li /ol  I do not have any adobe products, just Preview.  Even more than how to compress this file, what I really want to know is why is this happening? What is it about my computer or documents or preview that's making this so stupid??  THANK YOU.  <comment232560> It's probably because the images, etc. Are linked in to the .doc and need to be copied in when exporting to a pdf <comment232568> Even when I delete every single photo in the document, the .docx goes down to 450 KB and the PDF of that stays up at 86 MB. <comment232592> Have you tried to select everything in the document, copy and paste it over into a new one and export that as a PDF?
