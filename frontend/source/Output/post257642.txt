Error with Oh My ZSH themes, ZSH_THEME="random <body> I get the following message after installing Oh My ZSH and changing codeZSH_THEME="robbyrussel"/code to codeZSH_THEME="random"/code in .zshrc.     Users/me/.oh-my-zsh/oh-my-zsh.sh:source:110: no such file or   directory: /Users/me/.oh-my-zsh/themes/“random”.zsh-theme   <answer257643> Remove the code"/code's from the codeZSH_THEME/code variable. You want:  precodeZSH_THEME=random /code/pre  in your code.zshrc/code file. See the zsh theme documentation for an example that shows it, clearly, without the code"/code's on the value.  <comment321908> Actually, whether there are `"`s around `random` would not make a difference. The real issue is, that - according to the error message and contrary to the code snippets - curly double quotation marks (`“` and `”`, Unicode `U+201C` and `U+201D`) were used instead of straight quotation marks (`"`, ASCII `0x22`). <comment321921> Thanks for the information, didn´t saw the difference. <comment321929> @Adaephon yea, it was easier to tell him to remove the quotes than to stop using unicode characters. :)
