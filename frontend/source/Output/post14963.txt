Remove item from Context Menu <body> I noticed extra options pop up in my context menus, I'm not sure how I managed to get it (or how long ago I installed this item), but does anyone know how I can remove it? Particularly the iconStiX item, which doesn't work. I've tried looking in /Library/Context Menu Items, but there's nothing there  +1 if you can tell me where it came from.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U5McY.jpg" alt="Context menu that I&#39;m trying to kill"  <answer14967> Look into  ul licode~/Library/Contextual Menu Items/code/li licode/Library/Contextual Menu Items/code folders/li licode~/Library/Services/code/li licode/Library/Services/code/li /ul  To access them, open a Finder icon, press kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⇧/kbd+kbdG/kbd, or codeGo/code  codeGo to Folder/code and paste one of the two paths above.  You'll find there all the contextual menu extensions and your services. Move them to the folder to disable them.br You may need to Log Out/In to apply the changes.  <answer14995> I've just installed and then uninstalled iconStiX again - just to see where the stuff was placed.  The uninstall is like this em(see Readme.pdf in iconStiX.dmg)/em:     Throw away the following 4 items into the Trash:   ul lithe strongiconStiX/strong program in your codeApplications/code folder (or any other place of your choice)/li liin your code~/Library/Preferences/code:  ul licodeli.loos.trollin.iconStiX.plist/code/li licodeli.loos.trollin.iconStiX.LSSharedFileList.plist/code (if any)/li /ul/li lia folder named strongcodeiconStiX/code/strong in your code~/Library/Application Support/code folder/li /ul     Empty the Trash.   BUT this doesn't remove the Contextual Menu Items - unless you strongreboot/strong your Mac em(I did that, and the items was gone)/em.  <answer19853> You can modify what's in your right-click context menus going to Keyboard Shortcuts - Services and unchecking the services there.  <comment16127> The menu item can also be controlled from a script in `~/Library/Services` and/or `/Library/Services` <comment16138> @Rene right thanks, I've updated my answer <comment16142> Thanks for your answer, but: ~/Library/Contextual Menu Items - I don't have this folder; /Library/Contextual Menu Items - this folder is empty; ~/Library/Services - I don't have this folder; /Library/Services - I don't have this folder; /System/Library/Services - there's nothing in here that seems relevant. Any ideas? <comment16168> I took the liberty to reformat your answer <comment16175> @Loïc Wolff Looking good - now :o)
