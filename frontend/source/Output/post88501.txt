How can I make Text to Speech use different voices for different languages? <body> I am learning French and sometimes need to use Text to Speech to fix my pronunciation. As English is my second language, I also sometimes use Text to Speech with it.  The problem is that the English voices do not have correct French pronunciation, and vice versa. I have to open System Preferences to switch between the two every time.  How can I automatically switch between the voices according to the language of the text selected to be spoken? If there is no way to do that, how would do it using Automator/AppleScript?  <answer88505> Here is a possible answer from another forum:  https://superuser.com/questions/468130/mac-os-x-quickly-change-voices-for-text-to-speech  <comment103593> On Ask Different and all other Stack Exchange sites, you have to be that "someone" while answering questions. <comment103596> @duci9y It is also important when you ask a question to tell people what you already know.  I will fix it for you. <comment103600> Here is possible answer from a sister forum:  http://superuser.com/questions/468130/mac-os-x-quickly-change-voices-for-text-to-speech <comment103678> I quote from my original question, "How can I **automatically** switch between the voices according to the language of the text selected to be spoken? If there is no way to do that, how would do it using Automator/AppleScript?" <comment103691> If someone finds a way to detect the language automatically, it could also be posted as an answer to the questions linked above. <comment103702> Hasn't the last part of your question been answered now? <comment103916> Didn't know it was a duplicate. Teaches you how much tagging your question correctly is important.
