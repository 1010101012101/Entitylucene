Copy pasting italicized content in Pages <body> Pages is my word processor. I'm trying to copy a paragraph text from a docx file opened in Pages. Some words in the paragraph are italicized.   I'd like to paste it in a target doc which has paragraph styles set. When I paste I'd like to retain the italics of those words in the source doc.   The source and target docs used different styles for paragraph.   How do I paste it correctly?   <answer125247> Copy the text normally, then paste using ⇧⌥⌘V. This preserves character styles such as bold and italic but uses the destination paragraph styles.  <comment146564> wow, what a keyboard shortcut:)
