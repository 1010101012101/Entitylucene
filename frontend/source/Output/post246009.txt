Boot Loop - Trying to make a Yosemite KVM VM w/Chameleon Bootloader <body> I am trying to boot a Yosemite VM (10.10.5) following these instructions here.  But it gets stuck in a loop at the BIOS boot screen (the OS has not yet been installed)  My hardware is a Mac mini with Ubuntu 14.04 installed (I specifically need to use KVM to boot OS X VMs for my use case), hardware is:br CPU: GenuineIntel, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4578U CPU@3.00GHzbr Graphics card: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT integrated graphics controller (rev 09)br Motherboard: Apple Mac-35C5E0812OC7EEAFbr I have QEMU 2.6.0, and Chameleon Enoch r2839 (I've also tried Chameleon 2.3 r2838 with the same results)  The command I use to boot is:  precodebin/qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2048 \       -cpu core2duo,vendor=GenuineIntel \   -machine q35 \   -usb -device usb-kbd -device usb-mouse \   -device isa-applesmc,osk="insert-real-64-char-OSK-string-here" \   -kernel ./chameleon_enoch\   -smbios type=2 \   -device ide-drive,bus=ide.2,drive=MacHDD \   -drive id=MacHDD,if=none,file=./mac_hdd.img \   -netdev user,id=hub0port0 \   -device e1000-82545em,netdev=hub0port0,id=mac_vnet0 \   -monitor stdio \   -device ide-drive,bus=ide.0,drive=MacDVD \   -drive id=MacDVD,if=none,snapshot=on,file=./Yosemite.10.10.2.iso       -vnc 127.0.0.1:2 /code/pre  (real string osk string is inserted here, I just didn't add it for public posting)  When I boot, I get to this screen just fine:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/elXPA.jpg" alt="original boot screen"  When I boot with -v option, it gets to these screens, goes black, and then returns to the original boot screen shown previously:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nHolg.jpg" alt="attempt1screen1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Poul.jpg" alt="attempt1screen2" There does not appear to be any obvious errors or kernel panics. I googled the DSDT and SMBios messages and they don't appear to be anything that would cause issues in this case.  If I try booting it in safe mode (-v -x), I get these screens before it once again returns to the original boot screen:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FIEeD.jpg" alt="attempt2screen1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xb73O.png" alt="attempt2screen2"br Again, no obvious crashes or panics.  I've tried various combinations of -v, -f, -x, GraphicsEnabler=Yes/No, the behavior is basically always the same. Keep in mind, I am trying to boot and install OS X in a virtual machine, not on the computer itself.  Can anyone see any problems or suggest other troubleshooting I could do?  <answer247590> I eventually solved this: I had to upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 and use just the codeGraphicsEnabler=No/code flag as a boot option. You enter it in the same place after codeboot:/code that the code-v/code flag in the first screenshot.  Disclaimer: As far as the legal issues brought up in the comments, most people I talked to did not think you had to actively be running OS X on the machine, as you are allowed do things like run a different version of OS X in a VM, or use VMWare ESXi. I am not a lawyer and did not talk to one, so any individual concerned would have to consult their own legal team.  <comment303292> The SLA for OS X Yosemite does allow for its virtualization only on Apple-branded hardware however another requirement is it also has to be virtualized under a running occurrence of OS X not another OS on Apple-branded hardware. <comment303303> Hmm, ok, I didn't realize it had to be also be running the software. That said, it's possible my company has a different SLA as this is for commercial use. I will have to ask further about my personal situation, but my question still stands. <comment305532> @user3439894 I can't find the obligation to **not** run a virtualized OS X under a non-OS X operating system in the EULA. Where did you find it? <comment305537> @klanomath, In the SLA [OSX1011.pdf](http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/OSX1011.pdf) Section 2, B, i & iii are the key parts. <comment305540> @user3439894 2,B,i (only Apple hardware) is obvious, but in my opinion 2,B,iii allows to run e.g a virtualized OS X under Windows & VMware in a Boot Camp partition on Apple hardware. The german part (2,B,iii page 25 of 397) of the SLA doesn't even mention that OS X has to be installed on the Apple hardware and would allow KVM & a virtualized OS X. <comment305543> @klanomath, I'm not going to get into a legal discussion here, that's what lawyers are for. Anyway, the issue got resolved. That said, OS X runs like crap under virtualization compared to running natively on Apple-branded hardware and not all features are available under virtualization as well. So to me it seems absurd to install Linux on Apple-branded hardware to then install OS X in a VM under Linux. But to each their own.
