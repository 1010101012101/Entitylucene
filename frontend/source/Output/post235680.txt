How can I clear my iPhone of all photos and re-sync? <body> I have iCloud Photo Library which is supposed to optimise its storage on my iPhone. But it doesn't. It's currently taking up about 25 GB of storage. I decided that in order to reset its usage, I'd try switching off iCloud Photo Library and Photo Stream. It warned me I'd be deleting about 7,000 photos, and I said yes.  When I checked afterwards, the usage has only gone down to about 23 GB, and my Camera Roll still has over 13,000 items in it.  My question is, if I go through and delete every single photo on my iPhone, what will happen when I switch iCloud Photo Library back on? Will it re-sync and delete all my photos in the cloud, or will it reload my phone properly?  Any advice would be gratefully appreciated, thanks!
