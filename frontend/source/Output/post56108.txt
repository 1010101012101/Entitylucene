How can I monitor the FPS in OSX? <body> I'm looking for a solution to monitor the refresh rate of the OSX.  In several reviews like this one about the retina Macbook Pro by Anandtech they report emactual fps/em to discuss the performance of scrolling in Safari in Lion vs Mountain Lion.  What tool are they using to monitor the fps? What similar tool like this can you recommend?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQPEj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer56110> I use atMonitor for various things which has a live display of fps on there, scrolling up and down in Safari for example gives me 50fps.  Might do what you want.  <answer56136> The tool being used in the screen shot is "Quartz Debug"  It is part of Apple's free Graphics Tools for Xcode.  To get this app:  ul lidownload Xcode from the Mac App Store./li liOpen Xcode and select Xcode  Open Developer Tool  More Developer Tools.../li liThis takes you to Apple's developer download site.  You will need to register a free developer account to proceed./li liSelect "Graphics Tools for Xcode" to download a disk image with the tools./li liOpen the dmg and you can copy out "Quartz Debug" to your computer./li /ul  Running Quartz Debug should show the FPS meter.  It has various options which allow tweaking of Quartz settings.  <comment64419> Wow. This is an amazing tool! Unfortunately, it cannot monitor the fps when using integrated graphics. <comment64460> Sweet! Thank you. <comment225970> Note I alo had to go to window - FrameMeter
