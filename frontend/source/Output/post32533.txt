Forbidden error setting up a PHP app on Mac OS X 10.6 <body> I have enabled Web Sharing in OS X 10.6 and now I can access codehttp://localhost/~myuser/code from the browser.  Now I have copied this PHP app to my code~/Sites/the_app/code folder, but when I want to access it in the browser I get a strongForbidden/strong error message:     You don't have permission to access code/~myuser/the_app/code on this server.   Any ideas how can I fix this?  <answer32539> I know this KB document refers to 10.5, but it is possible that it might help you troubleshoot.  I had this same problem when I upgraded.  http://support.apple.com/kb/TA25038?viewlocale=en_US  To summarize, basically, you need a file named codemyuser.conf/code in the code/etc/apache2/users//code directory.  The contents of codemyuser.conf/code should contain the following:  precode&lt;Directory "/Users/myuser/Sites/"&gt;     Options Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  After that, set the permissions from the Terminal:  precodesudo chown root:wheel /etc/apache2/users/myuser.conf /code/pre  Then restart Apache. (Uncheck/Recheck the Web Sharing box in System Preferences.)  And remember to change all instances of codemyuser/code to your emexact/em username.  <answer42505> Try to codechmod 755/code the folder and all of its parent folders.  <answer64350> By default, client versions of OS X have PHP disabled in the apache server. Because of this, the server will not load an codeindex.php/code file unless you explicitly list it, and even then it will not run it.  To enable PHP, open the /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file and find the area where it lists the modules (near the top). At the bottom of both lists, there will be load commands for the PHP module which are commented out. Remove the # from those lines, save the file, and restart web sharing. Now, the server will automatically recognize and run your codeindex.php/code file.  <comment37233> Might get better answers on Apple.SE.
