When Terminal forks process, current app loses focus <body> While I'm running some program in Terminal (or iTerm2), when the program forks the process, the OS X desktop switches focus from the current application to the forked process. When this happens, the forked process name shows in OS X menu bar.   This is especially annoying while using full screen mode as it causes the  workspace to change when the forked process receives focus.  How can I stop this focus switch from happening? These terminal programs are interrupting the work I'm doing in other applications while they run.  <answer100080> Can you run your terminal program in the background?  I believe this will keep it from coming in focus on the desktop as well.  Just add '&amp;' to the end of the terminal command to run a process in the background.  So if your terminal command were:     sh someprocess.sh   change it to:     sh someprocess.sh &amp;   To bring a background process to the foreground in terminal use the command:     fg   <answer101318> As @patrix has suggested, it seems I'm only having this problem with Java processes.   This answer over at StackOverflow seems to solve the problem  <answer139693> In my case it was the Maven Failsafe Plugin that caused the annoying window focus stealing of ForkedBooter, and setting the codeJAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS/code variable in code.bashrc/code didn't help.  This fix applies to both Failsafe and Surefire (although in my case, Surefire wasn't stealing focus).  In your codepom.xml/code, add a code&lt;argLine&gt;-Djava.awt.headless=true&lt;/argLine&gt;/code line inside the code&lt;configuration&gt;/code for the failsafe (and/or) surefire plugin.  It will look like this:  pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"code&lt;!-- this is inside your &lt;project&gt;&lt;build&gt;&lt;plugins&gt; block --&gt; &lt;plugin&gt;     &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;     &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;     &lt;version&gt;${maven.surefire.plugin.version}&lt;/version&gt;     &lt;configuration&gt;       &lt;includes&gt;         &lt;include&gt;**/unit/**/*Test*.java&lt;/include&gt;       &lt;/includes&gt;       &lt;!-- prevent the annoying ForkedBooter process from stealing window          focus on Mac OS --&gt;       &lt;argLine&gt;-Djava.awt.headless=true&lt;/argLine&gt;     &lt;/configuration&gt;   &lt;/plugin&gt;   &lt;plugin&gt;     &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;     &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-failsafe-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;     &lt;version&gt;${maven.failsafe.plugin.version}&lt;/version&gt;     &lt;configuration&gt;       &lt;!-- prevent the annoying ForkedBooter process from stealing window          focus on Mac OS --&gt;       &lt;argLine&gt;-Djava.awt.headless=true&lt;/argLine&gt;       &lt;includes&gt;         &lt;include&gt;**/integration/**/*Test*&lt;/include&gt;       &lt;/includes&gt;     &lt;/configuration&gt;     &lt;executions&gt;       &lt;execution&gt;         &lt;goals&gt;           &lt;goal&gt;integration-test&lt;/goal&gt;           &lt;goal&gt;verify&lt;/goal&gt;         &lt;/goals&gt;       &lt;/execution&gt;     &lt;/executions&gt;   &lt;/plugin&gt; /code/pre  <comment117778> Which programs are you calling from Terminal? <comment117881> Maven. The Maven Surefire plugin for running Java Unit tests uses this [ForkedBooter](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/surefire-booter/apidocs/org/apache/maven/surefire/booter/ForkedBooter.html) class which always takes focus away from the terminal <comment117882> It's not just Maven but this is one of my concrete examples <comment117886> Could it be that it only happens with Java applications? <comment117889> Perhaps. If I find a counter-example I'll post <comment118065> I can confirm it happens with `mono` in a similar scenario. <comment118214> It happens with IntelliJ too. If I run JUnit tests from inside IntelliJ the app loses focus. Does anyone know if this still happens in Mavericks?
