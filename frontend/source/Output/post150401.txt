Tagged items not appearing correctly in Mavericks? <body> I'm running OS X 10.9.5. Recently, I used Handbrake 0.9.9 x86_64 (2013051800) to convert some WMVs to MP4s. There are roughly 150 videos, and I have attempted to tag them all. When in their respective folders, they look fairly normal, as this example demonstrates:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Sni1FXf.png" alt="normal file"  However, when I click on 'Blue' in the Finder sidebar, I see this for each video:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/oEvas9H.png" alt="abnormal file"  I am not having the same problem with any other files tagged with the same tag, and that includes seventeen other videos which I converted from AVIs to MP4s using the same Handbrake preset (there emmay/em have been a difference in the settings for picture size, but I don't think there was). This may mean it's completely unconnected to Handbrake, but it seems unlikely.  I tried running codels -l/code on the directory containing the affected videos and the directory containing the seventeen unaffected videos and they're all code-rw-r--r--@/code. Both sets of files have the extended attribute codecom.apple.metadata:_kMDIItemUserTags/code.  Can anyone shed any light on what might be happening here?  <answer150540> After reindexing my drive with codesudo mdutil -E /path/to/volume/code the files showed in the tag list correctly, so it was clearly an issue with the Spotlight index; hopefully this helps someone else in the future.
