how do I create an ISO/CDR file from a hard disk? <body> Presently I am attempting to back up my whole computer's primary hard drive to an ISO file.  When I attempt to do this using Disk Utility, I perform the following steps:  ol liOpen disk utility and choose the disk I want to create an image from in the left pane./li liClick on File-New-Disk Image from "MyDisk"/li liThen I choose Image format-DVD/CD write master/li /ol  Disk Utility runs for a long time, then as it nears the end of the operation it gives me the error "Filename too long" and quits.  As an alternative, I attempted to create an ISO file using hdiutil, but receive an error after the file reaches a size of 2 GB:  precodesh-3.2# sudo hdiutil makehybrid -iso -o /Volumes/Grieg/ChopinSnowLeopard.iso  /Volumes/ChopinSnowLeopard Creating hybrid image...   hdiutil: makehybrid failed - Operation not permitted /code/pre  If I try this alternative command, I receive a different error:  precodesh-3.2# hdiutil create -srcfolder /Volumes/ChopinSnowLeopard /Volumes/Grieg/ChopinSnowLeopard.dmg diskimages-helper: DI_kextDriveDisconnect returned 268435459 ((ipc/send) invalid destination port). /code/pre  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve either of these problems?  TIA.  <comment59712> Not an answer to your question, but there is no reason to back up to an ISO file. That is not an optimal file format or backup format for a backup of this size. Why not just clone the drive? <comment59760> Thank you--I used a cloning tool and it has worked great!
