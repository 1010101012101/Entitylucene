How can I quickly change a setting that is "deep" in a menu? <body> I need to toggle  "Allow Wi-Fi Calls" all the time.  Currently I have to do the following.  Tap Settings.  Scroll down to phone. Tap.  Find Wi-Fi Calls.  Tap. Toggle switch.  That's SIX things I have to do to change one setting.  And I have to change it all the time.  Is there a shortcut?  <comment174469> So I'll ask the question. Why do you need to turn off wifi calling?  I'm not familiar with it, however I think that it would just not allow wifi calling if that method didn't work.
