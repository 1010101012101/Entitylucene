iOS 10.2.1 ignores proxy settings <body> I have been messing about testing my local VPN mobileconfig and switching between different profiles etc. Now my iPhone has found a bug in iOS 10.2.1+ and I'm unsure how to go about fixing it since restarting and clearing settings won't work. The phone now ignores any proxy setting given to it :/  <comment350600> Do you want to edit one specific iOS version and detail one specific profile that fails or are you looking for how/where to report a bug? <comment350684> I am not able to diagnose the bug. I have tried resetting my network settings yet it still has chosen to ignore the proxy despite it working on other ios devices.
