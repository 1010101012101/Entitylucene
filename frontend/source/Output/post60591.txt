How to permanently put TextEdit in the Open with... menu list? <body> I'm a developer and often dealing with unusual file types. If I want to open one of these files in TextEdit, I have to start it first and then open the file with it, or drag the file to the TextEdit icon.  Is there a way to permanently put the TextEdit.app into the Open with... menu list no matter what file type I'm looking at?   Of course this procedure will be useful for whatever text editor you choose if TextEdit isn't your cup of tea.  <answer60626> The only way to do this with all file types is to create a service in automator, which actually should make things easier for you.  ol liOpen Automator and select "Service"./li liIn the "Service receives selected..." dropdown, change it to read "receives selected strongfiles and folders/strong in strongany application/strong"/li liSelect Utilities from the library menu in the left pane and double-click "Run Shell Script"/li liChange the "Pass Input" dropdown to "as arguments"/li liDelete the default script and replace with the following:/li /ol  code if [ -f "$1" ] ; then                           open -a "TextEdit" "$1" ; fi /code  Save this file as whatever you want it to show up as in your contextual menu, something like "Open With TextEdit" and you're done, you'll now have the option to open any file with text edit.   It won't be in the open with menu, it will be a separate item in the contextual menu grouped with any other services you have running.  On a side note, if you're developing on a mac you should really think about using a better text editor like TextMate or TextWrangler or Sublime Text, some of these even add the service for you to save you doing all of the above.  <answer62702> You can add supported file types by editing the Info.plist, but I don't know any way to do that for all file types. Adding UTIs like public.data or public.item to an Info.plist or com.apple.LaunchServices.plist doesn't seem to work.  I have used duti to make TextMate the default application for different plain text types:  precode# plain text files without an extension com.macromates.TextMate.preview public.plain-text all  # executable scripts com.macromates.TextMate.preview public.unix-executable all  com.macromates.TextMate.preview .as all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .ass all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .bash all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .bom all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .c all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .cfm all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .cfml all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .class all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .coffee all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .conf all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .cpp all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .css all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .csv all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .ctp all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .dat all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .data all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .doc all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .erb all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .fields all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .gemspec all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .h all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .haml all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .hotkey all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .hpp all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .idx all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .java all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .js all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .json all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .keylayout all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .kmlibrary all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .less all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .log all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .m all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .manifest all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .md all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .mm all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .msass all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .opml all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .pg all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .php all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .pl all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .plist all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .plist all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .py all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .rb all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .rd all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .rdoc all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .readme all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .rhtml all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .rst all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .sb all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .scss all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .sh all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .srt all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .strings all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .sub all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .tex all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .tsv all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .utf all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .xml all com.macromates.TextMate.preview .yaml all /code/pre  duti doesn't support just adding applications to open with menus without making them default though.  <answer90335> You can create a Service menu workflow as influencejamie describes. However you can just use the 'Open Finder Items' option and add TextEdit as the app.   There is a good post about it here, which explains how to create the workflow in more detail.   <answer139304> Just use the option "-e" to open with TextEdit: open -e yourfile.whatever and it'll open it in TextEdit.  <comment69787> +1, and yeah, TextEdit isn't a real plaintext editor--it can do it, but it doesn't have any features to make it easier, and would much rather be editing rich text. <comment106018> I have this desire, also.  Currently, I keep TextEdit in my Dock, so it is always available to drag a file onto. <comment106024> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment144386> Beautiful!  It would be even better if we could restrict this to all files in a text format (including source code and the like) <comment167021> is there any way to make it appear in the main menu instead of having to search for in the service menu? Or at least to hide unused items in service menu... <comment248442> @pqnet - did you find how to do this?
