AppleScript won't keystroke "22.com"? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8bjrY.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7gjFz.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried coding it in different ways, but no matter what I do it will not type "22.com".  <answer258563> I've found that trying to keystroke with a large number of characters is highly unreliable. It doesn't seem to wait for every character to be typed before returning. I'd suggest trying this workaround I've been using:  precodeon keystroke_string_(keystr)     tell application "System Events"         repeat with _character in keystr             keystroke _character         end repeat     end tell end keystroke_string_ /code/pre  That'll iterate through the characters, and press each one manually. I've found that this works nicely with any length of string.  <comment323050> Hi, welcome to Ask Different. Why not add this to your previous AppleScript question at: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/258415/how-do-i-open-an-application-and-get-it-to-log-in-using-applescript one of our users will likely be able to  kill all of your birds in one stone instead of opening new threads. <comment323051> If the first pic contains your real password, I recommend to change the password immediately. <comment323054> I just tried `tell application "System Events" to keystroke "22.com"` and it output: `22.com`
