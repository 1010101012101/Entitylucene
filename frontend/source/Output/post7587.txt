Any quizPack format spec? <body> I'm a Windows software developer interested in reading the code.quizPack/code file format. It is designed for Apple iQuiz software, and contains text quizzes for iPod. The text file format, unpacked from quizPack, "trivia.txt" is fully documented here. But how to unpack these files?  I cannot find any specification of this format on Apple website or elsewhere.   Here is a downloadable example of quizPack file.  This format can be created, for example, by iQuizMaker software. iTunes can read these files and export them to iPod as "unpacked" quizzes.  <answer7597> Okay, I dug into this and found that you have a couple of misconceptions, but it now all makes a little sense.  The page How to Install an iQuiz Package? says:  Shared iPod Quiz (iQuiz) games on iquizshare.com come in three formats:     ul   liFlat file format (e.g. codehistory_albert.txt/code)./li   liZipped package, which contains codereadme/code, codetrivia.txt/code, and maybe some customized artworks in code.tga/code format./li   liQuizPack format, which is created using Aspyr Media iquizmaker software./li   /ul   That third format? It's created by Aspyr software and read by Aspyr software—and nothing else. It's not an Apple format at all.  If you have a code.quizpack/code file and you want to read what's in it, here are the steps:  ol liGo to iquizmaker.com and download the free iQuiz Maker software (available for both Mac and Windows)./li liInstall iQuiz Maker./li liLaunch iQuiz Maker, choose File  Import, and then open your code.quizpack/code file.br Doing this creates the file (and any necessary folders) code~/Music/iTunes/iPod Games/iQuiz 1.0/&lt;quiz name&gt;/trivia.txt/code (Mac) or code~\My Documents\My Music\iTunes\iPod Games\iQuiz 1.0\&lt;quiz name&gt;\trivia.txt/code (Windows). /li liQuit iQuiz Maker, as you've got what you want./li /ol  You can't do these steps in reverse to turn a codetrivia.txt/code file into a code.quizpack/code file, but given that the code.quizpack/code file is fairly useless, there's no reason you'd ever need to.  hr  emOld version/em:  Can you give an example of what kind of file you have, and what you mean by "unpack"?  The article you linked to says that:     The text-based data files you create are not compiled or put into any unreadable form.    and     Tip: If you're curious and you've enabled disk access, you'll find your games in code/Volumes/(name-of-your-iPod)/iPod_Control/GameData_RO/code. One of the folders in that directory—possibly code11002/code—contains the iQuiz game. In that folder, look under codeUserTrivia/Packs/code to discover your user-installed game sets.   <comment8169> Sorry, I can't insert more than 1 normal link because of low reputation. <comment8261> I updated it for you. <comment8279> thank you very much!
