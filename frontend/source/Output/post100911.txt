Black screen after failed restore - G5 <body> I tried to restore a G5, something went wrong and now I have this at startup:  precodedyld: library not loaded: /usr/liblibconv.2.dylib Referenced from /bin/sh Reason: Incompatible library version: sh requires version 7.0.0 or later, but      libiconv.2.dylibprovides version 5.0.0 /code/pre  Can anyone help please?  I don't have a Tiger cd as I was restoring using Disk Utility.  I;ve tried various methods for booting from USB but the G5 doesn't seem to give them any power at boot.    <answer101113> The resolution to my problem was somewhat messy.   The black screen I mentioned was a result of a failed osx restore. It failed because of a bad dmg. The machine then suffered a kernel panic and I guess it was unable to roll back te changes it had made.   I removed some ugly looking ram and cleaned te others, reinstalled osx from disk using a new drive and have so far not experienced any problems.   Problem caused by dodgy dmg installation and dodgier ram  <comment118811> Where exactly is this error showing? Does a black screen with it show up on boot? <comment118848> @SoFly it's at boot. An apple logo displays then immediately after this. It goes no further until the fans go into tornado mode and I power off <comment118960> What disk did you use when you tried to restore it? Or how did you try to restore it? <comment118971> I used a dmg and disk utility. I swapped over the DVD drive and have now installed orig osx again. Phew <comment119094> Yeah, sounded like a bad image or install to me, but wanted to verify that you were using the correct media to install the OS on the correct arch.
