Is it possible to 'pair' an external keyboard to an external monitor on a macbook? <body> I have a Macbook, an external monitor and an external bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Is it possible for me to configure this setup such that the actions of the external keyboard and mouse will be limited to what's displayed in the external monitor?  <comment325686> Wacom drawing tablets have a feature where you can basically assign a work area, where the stylus is active. So mouse is probably doable somehow.
