I do not see "Internal Speakers" at all any more <body> When I turned on my iMac (MacOS Sierra) this morning, the video I tried to play did not play any sound. My volume icon is greyed out. I looked at the Outputs from the Sound Preferences. I do not see "Internal Speakers" at all any more.   There is no change when I plug in my headset.  The first sound comes out when the system starts.  I tried to treat lightly touching the toothpick through the headphone output but this did not happen.  strong[I deleted and reinstalled the operating system. My sound problem is resolved.]/strong  <comment362120> Welcome to Ask Different.
