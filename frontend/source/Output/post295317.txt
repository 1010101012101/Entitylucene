Is crisp pixel scaling in Motion possible? (instead of anti-aliasing) <body> Is it possible to export sharp pixels (similar to nearest neighbour interpolation in Photoshop, or image-rendering: pixelated in CSS) from within Motion?  I would like to work with small 1:1 pixel objects and scale them â€” but I don't want them antialiased.  In Premiere you get this rendering setting with Draft mode. Unfortunately Motion's Draft mode doesn't seem to use nearest-neighbour interpolation.
