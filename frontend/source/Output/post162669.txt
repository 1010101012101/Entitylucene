Macbook touchpad multitouch stopped working <body> Actually, two fingers for scrolling still works, but all other gestures don't. None with 3 or 4 fingers, and even side scrolling notification panel with 2 won't.  Out of the blue, it just stopped!  Any clues?  <answer162670> Answer found on apple boards:     supby Majicman in Nov 13, 2009 1:13 AM/sup      I'm an Apple technician who works for a self-servicing provider. This happened to me today as well. Reboot didn't fix it, neither did a new user account.      Here's what I did that did indeed fix it:      ul   liBoot into single user mode. (hold down kbdcommand + S/kbd on reboot)/li   liWait for the code#/code prompt/li   liType exactly this: codefsck_hfs -f /dev/disk0s2/code/li   /ul      When it's done, type codeshutdown -r now/code      Your Mac will reboot. Hopefully that fixed it for you, too!   For whatever reason I couldn't get into single user mode, so I just hold kbdoption/kbd and opened the Terminal there. Worked for me! :)  em( I just wished I knew what the bleep disk0s2 has to do with anything here! )/em  Also, someone else mentioned there the codefsck_hfs/code didn't work for them but this did:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /code/pre  <comment190550> Try running `diskutil info /dev/disk0s2` â€” it should be your boot disk. <comment190644> That helps a bit. `diskutil list` also says it's type `Apple_CoreStorage` with no name. My boot disk is probably `disk2`, though, which I left the default name `Mac OS X` and it's type `Apple_HFS`. `disk0s3` is `Apple_Boot` named `Recovery HD`.
