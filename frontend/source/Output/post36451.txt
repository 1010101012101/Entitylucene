How can I stitch a set of images together? <body> I have a set of images that are named codefoo-N.jpg/code, where codeN/code is a number from 0 to 100.  I'd like to stitch them together such that I have one long image, where codefoo-0.jpg/code is at the left and codefoo-100.jpg/code is at the right.  I can do this manually in Photoshop or Fireworks, but it'd take forever.  Is there a way to do this in bulk, like perhaps with Automator, Terminal, or an app?  <answer36463> You can do it with Imagemagick from a terminal. If you have Homebrew, installing it is as easy as:  precodebrew install imagemagick /code/pre  Once you have it, open the terminal and go to the folder where you have the pictures, then do:  precodeconvert foo* +append result.jpg /code/pre  And there you have it, your 100 pictures in a row. You can also make a column with them, instead of code+append/code use code-append/code.  <comment41467> This is off topic, try http://photo.stackexchange.com/ <comment41469> @GraemeHutchison I'm asking how to automate a repeated action in OS X using OS X tools. I'm not quite sure how it's off-topic or how a site for photography would be able to answer an OS X automation question: can you elaborate? <comment41763> OK its fine, thought you might get a better response from people who may do this all the time. i.e photographers. Seems you have the answer you were looking for so thats good.
