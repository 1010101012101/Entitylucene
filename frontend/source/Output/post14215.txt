The status LED on the underside of the PowerMate could be set up as an indicator of resource usage, i.e. CPU usage, when the input device is not in use, and when in use the LED could be set to indicate volume level by LED brightness.  The configuration software allows for custom configuration for each software application. A video editing program can use the PowerMate to scroll through the timeline. Or it can be configured to scroll through your browser page history and push to refresh. It would also work well for breakout-style games.  <answer15011> h2Belkin Headphone Adapter/h2  A short extension cable that acts identically to the built-in button on Apple's headphones, though it lacks the microphone. ($20)  img src="https://www.belkin.com/images/product/F8Z452_03/FUL1_F8Z452_03.jpg" alt="Belkin Headphone Adapter Picture"  The Belkin Headphone Adapter enables you to turn any pair of headphones, or other Stereo Audio Cable, into one that allows you to manage your iOS device in the same way you would with Apple's stock headphones. You have volume control buttons, as well as a middle click that allows you to;  ul li(1-click) play/pause,/li li(2-clicks) skip forward, and/li li(3-clicks) skip backwards with your media./li /ul  We use this in order to facilitate media playback in our car, which only has an 1/8" Stereo Line-In jack. We start whatever media we're going to listen to beforehand, then while in the car, we plug the cable in and start driving. Then, it is trivial to pause or skip songs when desired.  <answer15036> h2TuneBase Direct/h2  Belkin's TuneBase Direct ($69)  img src="https://www.belkin.com/images/TuneBaseDirect.jpg" alt=""  The Belkin TuneBase Direct plugs into the cigarette lighter of your vehicle and allows convenient access to an iPhone or iPod while charging it.

Which are all off topic as per the FAQ. <comment15328> @Mark Shopping recommendations are of the form "I'm looking to buy an X, is product Y or product Z better?" or "What is the best product to do X?". The reason why those are bad is because they are, among other things, too localized. This question is of a different form, and has broader appeal, so I think it's OK. <comment15330> If anybody who downvoted this question reads this, it'd be great if you un-downvoted it if you did so only because you felt it was "not allowed per the FAQ". If you have a legitimate reason, then don't listen to me if you still think it should remain downvoted :). <comment16255> This laptop stand is really poorly designed and overpriced. I'd recommend getting a height adjustable Adam Hall stand for about half the price: http://www.adamhall.com/en/ah_Stands_SLT001E_-_Laptop_Stand.html <comment16279> The picture on Belkin's site, as compared to this picture, makes it look like the stand is flexibly tense? Meaning you can bend it to a certain extent and it will keep enough tension to act as a mount? <comment16302> @VxJasonxV Yeah, but it's not really long enough to do interesting things with, but it does allow you to be more *flexible* in the positioning of your device. <comment16303> My biggest problem with using this is that my Cigarette Lighter is recessed under my stereo deck and all the dashboard buttons. So I think, if the neck is long enough, the phone will be low, but may still work out. I'll have to check this out soon. <comment16304> @VxJasonxV Can you post a picture of its position? <comment16313> Not in a comment I can't. This link will have to do: [Honda Civic Interior](http://i.imgur.com/GN99v.jpg) Note how it's recessed behind the gear/handbrake. (And if anyone's interested, no, this is not actually a picture of my actual car, nor is this my picture.) <comment54590> "searchable PDF" as in it does OCR? <comment54591> Given how broad a net this question casts, I'm amazed that almost a year later, there are only 9 answers. <comment54594> @DanielL Indeed <comment106832> Seem to be Unibody only.
