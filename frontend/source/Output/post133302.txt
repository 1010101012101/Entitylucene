Reconciling Chrome Shortcuts in Parallels <body> On OS X, a new Chrome tab can be opened by pressing kbdCmd+T/kbd, but on Windows you press kbdCtrl+T/kbd. This works fine if you map kbdCmd/kbd to kbdCtrl/kbd in Parallels, but becomes problematic when cycling between tabs.  In Windows kbdCtrl+Tab/kbd advances to the next tab, but in OS X kbdCmd+Tab/kbd switches between applications. As a result I am constantly context-switching for Chrome between OS X and Windows in Parallels. Furthermore, I have to move a finger to the kbdCtrl/kbd key to cycle between tabs on OS X.  Is there a recommended way to reconcile these differences so that I can preferably cycle between tabs with kbdCmd+Tab/kbd without ruining other key combinations?  <answer207293> The best I've found is to go into Parallels Preferences and add the key-binds I use:  ul likbdCmd-Shift-R/kbd Full Refresh/li likbdCmd-R/kbd Simple Refresh/li likbdCmd-Shift-I/kbd Open Dev Tools/li likbdCmd-O/kbd While Dev Tools are open, search for a file/li /ul  Maybe others will have additional shortcuts that they use.
