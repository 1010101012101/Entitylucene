Unable to use SSH/Microsoft Remote Desktop after Yosemite update <body> So I have been trying to log onto a virtual machine (a linux server for my school).  I have Remote Login enabled, and it worked perfectly prior to the update.  Now when I try to use ssh, it just does nothing until I get the error: sh: connect to host **...* port 22: Operation timed out.  If I try to use Remote Desktop, it says I have to either activate remote desktop or it is a problem on the other side, which I know it isn't because I am able to log onto the server on other computers/Macs.  Anything I have to do?  Thanks  <answer157524> I ran into a similar problem after updating to Yosemite 10.10.1  Could you please check the output of tcpdump in another Terminal window, while you are connecting to your remote ssh server?  I have the suspicion you're hitting the same redirect-error I am seeing on my box recently :-/  How to get the information:  ol liOpen Terminal/li litype "sudo tcpdump -vv" -- hit return/li liOpen another Terminal/li liTry to connect to your server via ssh/li liLook at the output of tcpdump and find the remote address of your server/li /ol  If you do NOT see your server address, but rather some strange redirect (mine goes to gl02.opentracker.net):  Welcome to an unsolved, nasty problem-bug.
