Mail does not "reply all": Removes CC addresses if they are in your own "accounts"? <body> Alice and Bob share a computer. They both have email accounts in Mail. Charlie sends an email to them both:   codeTo: Alice Cc: Bob/code  Alice gets it and hits "Reply All" and Mail opens a new message composition window:  codeTo: Charlie/code  Bob is removed. Why? Because Apple thinks it's silly to reply to yourself. It knows Bob has an email account on the same computer as Alice, in the same mail client! So it assumes Alice and Bob are emthe same person/em, and removes Bob from the reply.  Is there any way to disable this very inconvenient software bug?  <comment304084> Very very simply - don't share accounts. They're not made to be shared. <comment304085> You mean, set up separate users at the OS level? So Alice and Bob have to log out and in to share a computer? <comment304086> Yes, that's how it's supposed to work. <comment304087> [Fast user switching](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18897) is pretty fast. You don't even have to log out.
