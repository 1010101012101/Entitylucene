Appleid password keeps needing to be reset <body> Everytime I try to download an app onto my iphone it says I have the wrong password and I have been writing them down because I am so frustrated.  I then try to login on my PC and indeed it does not remember my password and I have to reset it.  I have gone through about 5 resets recently and it is getting frustrating.  Any suggestions?  <comment186977> Log into appleid.apple.com and check all the info there, and then also change your security questions.  Perhaps someone else has figured out how to reset your password. <comment186991> or perhaps you have 2 accounts?
