Music from Cloud gets in the way of the original AAC on Itunes <body> I have a big itunes Music collection with high quality original rips from CD on an external harddisk. It used to be on the comnputer. I have the problem now, that since this displacement from the Mac to the external harddisk (indicated, of course, in the preferences of Itunes), Itunes still has my perfect order of the collection but instead of showing me the original AAC Audio-File on the harddrive he replaces them with the respective Icloud song, giving me shitty quality of my own music. What went wrong here and how can I fix this in a smart way?
