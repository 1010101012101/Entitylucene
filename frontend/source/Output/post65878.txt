Can I open a PST file without importing it? <body> In Outlook for PC I can open or close PST files. This allows me to keep my PST at a reasonnable size, while being able to consult older messages.  In Outlook Mac (2011) I can only find the option to import a pst, which I don't want (I have 20GB of archives spread in 6 files).  Is there a way to just open PST without importing the contents in my main data store?
