Why does a string of arabic characters crash Safari and other web browsers? <body> I was reading an article about a problem with Mac and iOS. Why does this string of Arabic characters  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CCSxW.png" alt="enter image description here"  crash Mac computers running Safari?  http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/08/rendering-bug-crashes-os-x-and-ios-apps-with-string-of-arabic-characters/  <answer100427> As the arstechnia link to ycombinator page states, it is a "bug inside Apples CoreText font rendering framework".  This post on a Russian website drew attention to it: http://habrahabr.ru/post/191654/  (translated page here: http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fhabrahabr.ru%2Fpost%2F191654%2F )  The comments under the ycombinator article are the most interesting, with one reader pointing out that this bug is already fixed in Mavericks  Also, if I had enough reputation, I would downvote your question for putting an offending string in the question and thus risks causing a crash for some apple.stackexchange.com readers.  A slightly malicious or somewhat stupid move on your part, I dare say.  <comment118223> Luckily, the site has editors on and Daniel Lawson was able to edit out the offending string so that all viewers of the home page don't experience a crash. If you want to see the crash yourself - select the edit button on the main question and look at the original text of the question. Save your work in Safari first! <comment223682> Well... it hasn't been fixed in iOS 8.3 - just confirmed that it resets a phone and when done properly, can totally lock a users Messaging app.
