Application that allows you to customize which keys to use for mousekeys <body> Is there an application for customizing mouse-keys, specifically choosing which keys to use?  I don't have a numpad so I can't use the built-in mouse-keys.  <answer75487> The predefined settings in KeyRemap4MacBook aren't really usable, but you can add custom settings by creating a private.xml.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wcee9.png" alt=""  See the source for the virtual keycode constants and the predefined settings.
