OSX: Stop autocorrect splitting words <body> I am a programmer, and often I have words in all lowercase, not seperated by a space or hyphen.  In some *situations OSX will sometimes change codeinfoclass/code to codeinfo class/code for instance  *context aware I'm sure  This feature has breached my annoyance ceiling. Is there anyway to turn it off?  I enjoy autocorrect, just not the word splitting feature.  <answer134880> Navigate to strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Text  Correct Spelling Automatically/strong (uncheck)  If you wish to leave autocorrect on, but create certain exceptions, you can alternatively leave it checked and in the same pane add, for example:  Replace: codeinfoclass/code  With: codeinfoclass/code   This sets up an exclusion of sorts so that autocorrect does not change it to codeinfo class/code  <comment159795> Thanks, I enjoy autocorrect, just not the word splitting feature.
