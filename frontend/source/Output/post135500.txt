Free app to detect & delete duplicate files from my Mac <body> I am just wondering is there any way to find duplicate files on my Mac?   strongFor example:/strong when I download something from bittorrent, some unnecessary files also download along with the main file with code.dat/code extension. I want to delete all of these code.dat/code files at one time. Currently I have a lot of these files on my computer &amp; they are stored in many different directories. It would be a lot of work to delete them one by one.   Thus, are there any free apps to do that sort of job or some way I can find &amp; delete them?  <answer135502> Beware : once you change the content of a torrent, strongyou're not able to seed it anymore./strong  Open a finder window, search for all files named code.dat/code then just press kbdcmd/kbd+kbda/kbd (select all) then kbdcmd/kbd+kbdbackspace/kbd (delete) then kbdcmd/kbd+kbdbackspace/kbd+kbdmaj/kbd (empty the bin)  You can also use gemini to find duplicates then delete them with Finder, or if you're familiar with bash :  precodefind -not -empty -type f -printf "%s\n" |     sort -rn |     uniq -d |     xargs -I{} -n1 find -type f -size {}c -print0 |         xargs -0 md5sum |         sort |         uniq -w32 --all-repeated=separate /code/pre  <answer135504> You might want to take a look at Gemini. Its $10US, but it is a very powerful utility. I've used it with iTunes music folders and numerous folders of camera card dumps. A colleague of mine uses Gemini to prune through 15 years of digital files, many of which were duped as backups when technologies changed at my school. (Disclosure: I have no financial interest in the Gemini app.)  <comment160581> Do you want to find & delete duplicates or files ending in `.dat`? This doesn't seem to be the same thing. <comment160584> @patrix Thanks for commenting. No, here i just gave an example with that. I want to find out all duplicate files what ever that is then delete. <comment160621> Your so called "example" is confusing and is not really an example of what you're asking
