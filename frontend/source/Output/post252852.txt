Restore data from backup without deleting - iphone <body> Edit: was told that this was a duplicate question, so I have a follow up whitch i cant find the answer to. What if i synk my contact, messages, etc to icloud from the new phone, then restore the backup via itunes, the import the iclud again?  Earlier, with my older phones, I have just backed up and imported the backup into the new phone with no problem. but this time I have used my new phone (iphone SE) for a couple of months before I found time to restore the old one (iphone 4s) and import it to my new. So, how do I do that without loosing all that is currently on my new phone?   Thanks  <comment314610> You can't mix backups
