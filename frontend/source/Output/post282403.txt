Contacts imported from sim are not saved to iCloud <body> Recently I bought an iPhone. Not it works under latest ios 10.3.1. On my sim card there is more than 500 contacts. I would like to avoid to insert them manually one by one.   My icloud is turned on, icloud for contacts also.   I imported my contacts from sim, but they did not appear in icloud when I login to icloud via web browser.   Is there a way to do this anyway except creating it manually?
