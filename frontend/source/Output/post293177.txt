All Apps Unexpectedly Quit, Including Finder <body> I woke up this morning to a Mac without a menu bar, showing a Desktop without any of my icons on it. The Dock was still running, and I could move between my (now empty) Spaces.   That said, none of the apps in the Dock had the activity indicator light under them, not even Finder. As it happened, I was able to just click on the apps in the Dock, and they reopened, (opening Finder brought back the menu bar and Desktop icons).  What could have possibly happened to cause this? I didn't even know that the Finder could actually close.  My only thought is that maybe the Mac automatically tried to update, but couldn't actually restart for some reason. There was a System Update in the App Store that required a restart that I hadn't (and still haven't) done. Moreover, when I tried to install the update earlier in the day, I was told that some applications needed to be closed before the restart could take place.  However, I didn't schedule the update to run, and I've never had macOS decide to install an update on its own, so I don't think that this is likely.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what could have caused this?  EDIT: This exact same thing happened this morning as well, so I'm beginning to think my botched update theory is correct.  <comment369888> What version of macOS is running and on what Mac model? (You can go to the Apple menu  About This Mac for this information.) <comment369889> I have a Mac Mini (Late 2012) running macOS 10.12.5
