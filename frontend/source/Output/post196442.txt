iPhone Exchange email encoding incorrect <body> We have Exchange emails configured in one user's iPhone 6 but when the user replies from her iPhone in Russian, her email is encoded incorrectly. To solve the problem, we have already configured the Exchange 2010 server to use UTF-8 encoding.  The encoding is working perfectly fine with other devices but her iPhone does not respect the encoding preference. How can I solve this issue?  <comment234647> What is the user interface language of the problem iphone? <comment234649> @Tom Gewecke!
