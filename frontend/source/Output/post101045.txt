Enumerating messages in Outlook's Drafts folder generates an error <body> I would like to enumerate the messages in Outlook's 'Drafts' folder.  When I run this script:  precodetell application "Microsoft Outlook"   set theMessages to every message in the drafts   --returns 1   display dialog of (count of theMessages)   repeat with theMessage in theMessages     display dialog of the class of theMessage    -- displays 'inm'     display dialog of the subject of theMessage  -- error here   end repeat  end tell /code/pre  I get an error that reads codeMicrosoft Outlook got an error: Can’t make subject of outgoing message id 15002 into type string./code.  It seems like codetheMessage/code is the ID of the message, even though its codeclass/code is 'inm' (guessing that this means inbox message).  If I cast codetheMessage/code to a codeMessage/code:  precodedisplay dialog of the subject of (theMessage as message) /code/pre  I get a different error: codeCan’t make «class inm » id 15492 of application "Microsoft Outlook" into type message./code  What am I not understanding?  <answer101047> The correct syntax:  precodedisplay dialog of the (subject of theMessage as text) /code/pre
