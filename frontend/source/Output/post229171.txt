Executing executable file by means of script file <body> For executing file in linux terminal we run something like this: ./sflm -start Now, if i want this procedure is done by executing a script file what should i do ? I want to for example run this command : ./script.pl and then it run automatically my main command (./sflm -start). Thanks in advance  <answer229184> I'm going to assume that, from your question, you would like to run a specific command from a script.  Quite simply, in your script, start with  precode#!/bin/bash /code/pre  and below that, add your command name  precodesflm /code/pre  Of course, this assumes that you have moved the codesflm/code binary to a /.../bin folder. If you haven't, then  precodebash /path/to/sflm /code/pre  This specifies that code/path/to/sflm/code is to be run by codebash/code. Substitute codebash/code with any other shell of your choice.  Finally,  precodechmod 775 /path/to/script /code/pre  And code./script/code to run.  <comment279504> It's a little unclear what you're asking. Do you want a shell script to execute a series of executables?
