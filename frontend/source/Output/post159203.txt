How to use Xcode 6 debugging for single C file <body> Xcode 6 has Run, build, pretty much everything in debug menu greyed out for a single C file that I open in Xcode. This is a prebuilt program. I wish to debug it, and make changes to the file, but it seems that it must be a project to use debug functionality. Is this true?  I am in university so I wish to have single files as they are submitted like that. If it is not possible to debug on Xcode, are there any better recommendations?  Thanks.  <answer159204> You need to have project in order to be able to debug in Xcode. Xcode has to know how to compile/link/build Your files. You can make it very quickly by creating strongCommand line tool/strong. Go to codeFile/code - codeNew../code - codeProject.../code kbd⌘/kbdkbd⇧/kbdkbdN/kbd. Choose strongOS X/strong - strongApplication/strong - strongCommand Line Tool/strong. On the next screen choose language to be strongC/strong. Then You'll have new project with strongmain.c/strong file where You can start coding and debugging.  <comment187128> To make it clearer you do not debug a file you debug a program that has been compiled from one or more files - so you have to tell Xcode about the program
