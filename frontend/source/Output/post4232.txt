How can I see the system status during boot? <body> I would like to monitor the messages generated when I boot my Mac, similar to what you on a *nix box. Is there key-combo to press/hold that will let me do this?  <answer4235> You have to press kbdcmd/kbd + kbdv/kbd upon startup to see the boot output. Press this right after the emchime/em.   If you want to make that permanent, you should probably do something along the lines of:   precodesudo nvram boot-args="-v" /code/pre  To emundo/em the above:  precodesudo nvram boot-args= /code/pre  in the Terminal. (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)  strongnote/strong: I haven’t tested the above commands, but I’m sure a google query will help you there if you want to make it permanent.  <answer8208> If you want to see the boot messages after the boot occurred, log in and run codesudo dmesg/code in Terminal.app.  <comment4116> I can hardly wait to try this.  I hate staring at the apple on boot. <comment8895> Why? What's wrong with it?
