All music gone in iTunes version 12.4.0.119 after upgrade <body> All of my music in iTunes is gone.  I upgrade to version 12.4.0.119 from the previous version.  After I rebooted all of the music and custom playlists are gone in iTunes.  All of the media files are available on my hard drive and iTunes is pointed at this folder.  strongemIs there an .xml file that I may need to move to another directory in order for iTunes to look in the appropriate place to 'see' the music and playlist files/db?/em/strong  ul liI am running Windows 7 64-bit on this machine.  /li liI have no other issues with other applications./li liMy event log is clean./li liI synch iTunes to an iPhone 5S. /li liAll of my music and playlists on the phone are not affected by the issue as far as I can see./li /ul  I can't find anything of value on the Internet regarding this issue.  Perhaps I am using the wrong search parameters.  TIA  <comment294657> iTunes Library.itl and iTunes Music Library.xml are critical. Make sure that they're good. <comment294658> That's what I am asking about.  I mentioned the xml files.   How can I tell iTunes to use the correct ones?  What are the correct ones?  What is the path to correct ones? <comment294660> It simply uses whatever one is in your iTunes folder (C:\Users\username\My Music\iTunes\). The correct ones would be generated by iTunes in the pastâ€“perhaps if you have a backup, use one of them. <comment294701> btw, don't attempt to sync the phone until you get this fixed. If your iTunes Library file appears to be in the right place, by default as @JMY1000 says, & it's still not picking it up, try launching iTunes holding Shift & it will ask you to find the library manually. Assuming the lib itself is still OK, this ought to fix the association.
