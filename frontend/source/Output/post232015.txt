Standard Installation Locations for git repositories (e.g. jQuery) <body> I've found a few different answers, and was curious if there is a standard between it being in a folder under $HOME or something like /var?  <answer232027> No standard but if a repo then it is only writeable by you so under $HOME  If it is on a server and no access except by http or git protocols then anywhere (and some setups might use var I would use /git)
