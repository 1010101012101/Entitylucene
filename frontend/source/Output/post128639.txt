Any ideas?  <answer128763> Go to /Macintosh HD  Library  Preferences, move to the trash the file com.apple.TimeMachine.plist and restart the Mac.  Open Time Machine Preferences and "Choose" or "Add" the disk as a Backup Disk. The following backup will be added to the existing ones.  <answer129141> Turns out my codeToshiba Canvio 1TB USB 3.0 hard drive (3 year warranty)/code is busted as I plugged it in my PC to check and it was not recognized there either.  I suspect I leave it plugged in too long; It's plugged in to my USB hub.       It's still under warranty so I mailed it to Toshiba Support for store credit.   <comment150927> Thanks. I followed your instructions. When I go to `Time Machine Pref  Select Backup Disk`, my hard drive doesn't display.  Only option I have is `Other Time Capsule: Set up a Time Capsule that is not listed here`
