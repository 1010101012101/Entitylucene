Auto-updating Homebrew <body> i'm currently using the Homebrew package manager and my question is: is possibile to write a bash's script in order to execute codebrew update/code and eventually codebrew upgrade/code whenever opening a shell for the first time? I'm using iTerm at the moment.   <answer206474> This is very easy to do.  For efficiency (and cool factor), I would use a tool like Lingon to launch this script periodically using launchctl/launchd instead of each time you start a shell. On my MacBook, it takes 3 seconds to update the second time (no work done, DNS cache set, etc...) and it take 10 second to run the first time (no work done) or 15+ seconds if a package needs to be downloaded or compiled.  Perhaps once a day or once an hour - running in the background would be sufficient given those times to execute?  You could make a simple script code/usr/local/bin/brewup/code that calls brew in turn and logs the results to the system log  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code#!/bin/bash  brew=/usr/local/bin/brew logger=/usr/bin/logger  $brew update 2&gt;&amp;1  | $logger -t brewup.update $brew upgrade 2&gt;&amp;1 | $logger -t brewup.upgrade $brew cleanup 2&gt;&amp;1 | $logger -t brewup.cleanup /code/pre  I just call the brewup when I'm about to go make tea or when I get started and let it run in the background.  precodebrewup &amp; /code/pre  <comment248871> You can do this in `~/.bash_profile` file. You'll need to check if only 1 Terminal session is open and then run `brew update`. Check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6172663/how-can-i-tell-in-script-how-many-terminals-are-open-in-mac-os-x for determining number of Terminal windows. <comment248874> That is the number of the terminals that are open when the script is executed or the number of terminals opened in general? <comment248876> That's the number of Terminals opened (windows + tabs) when the script is run. `~/.bash_profile` is automatically executed at the start of Terminal session. This check is needed if You need to run `brew update` at the first start. If You want to run this every time new window is opened, skip this step and run `brew update` in `~/.bash_profile`. <comment248877> It will make opening a Terminal tab  very slow <comment248878> Ok thank you! :) It will decrease the terminal's performance very bad? <comment248890> +1 I agree that it's better to use tome sort of launchclt instead of running at every start of Terminal. Additonally it's Terminal independent (for iTerm users). <comment248891> This is brilliant, thank you! :) How about crontab instead of Lingon? <comment248892> @g_rmz There's nothing wrong with crontab and it's easy to know. If it works, run with it. The benefits of `launchd` over `cron` is that it's more resilient, more power friendly, and handles sleep / missed intervals more naturally. <comment248893> Perfect! Thank you again! <comment248900> Yes - it will require a link across the internet and work to compare with a server for the update + possibly a build and at least downloads for the upgrade so milliseconds or seconds at least (i.e. noticable) rather than nanoseconds
