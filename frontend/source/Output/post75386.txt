Why isn't my Qmaster cluster showing up in Compressor? <body> I created and added two computers to a Qmaster cluster in Qadministrator so that a Compressor export would be faster. However, the cluster doesn't show up in Compressor! What do I do? I have no clue how to fix this, but I really need the extra processing power from the other computer.  <comment87562> Which of these steps is failing on you?

I will repair permissions and reinstall if necessary, and report back.
