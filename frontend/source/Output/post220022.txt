How do I build FFMpeg with non-default libraries when using Homebrew <body> I am trying to build FFMpeg with libvpx so that I can encode a WebM video. How can I re-build FFMpeg with libvpx using Homebrew?  I tried encoding a video with FFMPEG and libvpx installed separately I get the error codeEncoder (codec vp8) not found for output stream #0:0/code  <answer220026> I don't consider this the answer, but I ended up just uninstalling FFMPEG and re-installing using codebrew install ffmpeg --with-libvpx/code  <answer220056> Ok, figured it out: There is a codere-install/code command for Homebrew: br codebrew reinstall ffmpeg --with-libvpx/code
