"config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories <body> I'm currently using codepyenv/code and codepyenv-virtualenv/code, which i've installed via codeHomebrew/code. I've added codeif which pyenv &gt; /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv init -)"; fi/code to enable shims and autocompletion and codeif which pyenv-virtualenv-init &gt; /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-      init -)"; fi/code in order to enable auto-activation to my code.bash_profile/code.  Suddendly, running codebrew doctor/code, the following message shows up:  precode"config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories. `./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when compiling and linking.  Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:  /usr/local/var/pyenv/shims/python-config /usr/local/var/pyenv/shims/python2-config /usr/local/var/pyenv/shims/python2.7-config /code/pre  What should i do to fix the problem?  <comment292018> report as a bug to Homebrew :) The pyenv port should have dealt with putting the files in the correct place and telling the rest of the ports about them as in effect they are Homebre supplied scripts. I suspect they will cause no issue as I would count anything else except peen looks in pyenv/shims <comment292019> What's the peen port? <comment292022> So, what should i do? Upgrade pyenv via `brew upgrade pyenv`? <comment292023> I left as a comment as I don;t use Homebrew and so can't check the details but just working on running a port should not break the port system
