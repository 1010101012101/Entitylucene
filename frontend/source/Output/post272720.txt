Automatic switch of cursor to external display according to input device <body> Would it be possible to switch the location of the mouse from one display to depending on which input device is being used?  For example, I have an external mouse connected to my MacBook. When I move the trackpad, the cursor would automatically move to my MacBook display. When I move the mouse, the cursor would automatically switch over to the external display without my having to move the mouse from my MacBook display all the way over to the external display.  This would be very useful, especially when switching between the displays quite often.
