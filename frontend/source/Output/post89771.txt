Finder window, Save As prompt missing sidebar entries <body> Check out this screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HNLr.png" alt="Save As dialog"  Why is everything missing in the sidebar? Normally I would see Desktop, Downloads, a custom list of favorite folders, Applications, Library, etc. Suddenly this started happening and it's super annoying because I have to browse everywhere manually on the right side. This is the Save As dialog in Chrome, but it's the same way in a regular Finder window. I'm in OS X Mountain Lion.  <answer89775> You probably accidentally hid the favourites list. If you hover your mouse to the right of the strongFavorites/strong text, you'll see a small emShow/em text appear. Click it, and your favourites should reappear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vG8gF.png" alt="hover button"  <comment105451> Usability for the win! <comment105455> ARRRRGH yep this worked. I never knew this option was there. <comment105461> Yeah, one of the stupider changes made in Lion. Back in 10.6 they had the nice drop-down triangles standard in most UIs. <comment274699> Ok, I've got a similar issue except that the entire favorites bar is missing.  I don't even have the 'FAVORITES' text to click on.
