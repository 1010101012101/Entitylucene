After formatting and installing Yosemite, where should I get my data back from to prevent problems? <body> So that is my predicament. I've format the HD after 4 years of use as my Mac Pro was already playing up for a year or so and I suspect it collected a lot of rubbish.  After formatting and reinstalling Yosemite I don't know whether it's better to recover all my data from the Time Machine backup or from my data backup (on another disk)? I don't want to get all the rubbish (viruses, trojans, outdated plists etc) back.
