Acknowledging an Exchange calendar response triggers a new invitation <body> I have Calendar connected to an Exchange 2010 server. I created an event with several (~40) persons. When someone answers I sometimes (not always) have a notification in Calendar with an "OK" button.  If I click "OK" the invitation is sent again to everybody.  I also noticed that sometimes when I snooze an alarm the other invited persons receive a notification per email.  strongEdit 1/strong  This happens with each and every event that I create on Exchange, not only the example above.  strongEdit 2/strong  Is there a way to solve the problem? Or is there a way to gather more information (for example logs)?  strongEdit 3/strong  I just noticed that when clicking on "OK"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCoAg.png" alt="enter image description here"  Calendar sends an email to the attendees (I found it in the "Sent" folder) with the invitation attached (which makes no sense).  precodeBEGIN:VCALENDAR METHOD:REQUEST PRODID:Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 VERSION:2.0 BEGIN:VTIMEZONE TZID:W.

I have had same issue a while ago, and decided not to change stuff via an Apple device.  I know it's not the answer you were hoping for, but's the reality at this moment.  <answer168955> Heres a long shot in the Calendar.app prefs at the bottom of the codeAdvanced/code pane, do you have checked:  codeAsk before sending changes to events/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPZBU.png" alt="enter image description here"  From what I understand this prevents messages being sent  other people when you make changes. It may include invitations  <answer178401> I have this exact problem too. Apple Calendar + Office 365 Exchange = spam all your invitees when you are the organizer of an event and you confirm/snooze a notification of an event.  I've stopped using it and rely only on Outlook for Mac instead.  <answer199900> It seems that it was a bug and that it will be fixed with OS X 10.11.0 and iOS 9.  Since the first public beta (on both iOS and OS X) the problem disappeared (without any change on my side).  <comment165648> To narrow down the problem a bit, have you found that the responses from specific people always cause this behavior, or does it appear to occur randomly, with random people? An example would be that a response from user A always triggers this behavior, while a response from user B never does. I'm far from being an Exchange expert at all, but finding a correlation between a user 'out there' and an odd behavior can be helpful in troubleshooting. If there is a correlation, it may be a simple setting on the users' configurations. <comment165651> It's not user related. Happens with random persons. <comment165659> Oh, well. it was worth a shot. Hope you figure it out. <comment197976> Not using OS X is as you said not a solution. Also not using the calendar ... <comment198457> It was checked. It only asks when I actively change something. <comment198602> Could you check if the Respond was send from iPhone user. <comment198615> @Buscar웃 No iPhone involved (I am using OS X and the other users mostly Outlook on Windows). But this is not relevant: Calendar should not send another invitation when clicking on "OK". <comment198625> what is not relevant? <comment198626> Which client is the recipient using. Calendar sends an email it should not send. <comment198692> See the edit: the problem is that Calendar sends an email it should not send. After clicking "OK" it sends an invitation again. Exchange is not even involved.
