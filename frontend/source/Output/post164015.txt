Adding "local" to the DNS Search Domains has no effect <body> I have a Mac Mini (Yosemite) on my local network and it's not running a DNS server at all. When I want to access it over SSH from a Terminal on my Macbook Air (Yosemite), I can type:  precode$ ssh myserver.local /code/pre  And that works fine.   But I wanted to avoid having to type the ".local" domain every time, so I added the "local" domain to the Search Domains list in Network Settings (for my Wi-Fi adapter which is the one currently in use in my MBA).  If I then try:  precode$ ssh myserver /code/pre  that doesn't work (Could not resolve hostname).  Any idea why?  <answer164044> Hostname resolution in Mac OS X (since ~10.3) has roughly spoken - i exclude various cache mechanisms - the following operating sequence:  ol li'Files' (e.g. /etc/hosts) -/li limDNS -  /li liDNS (search domains) -  /li liDNS/li /ol  Valid names for the different name resolution methods:    for 1: almost arbitrary namesbr for 2: name.localbr for 3: name (+ search.domain in your network prefs) A Start Of Authority (SOA) record for the top level domain is obligatory.br for 4: fqdn  In your first scenario (codemyserver.local/code) you only use 'Files' and mDNS. 'Files' fails because there is no entry codemyserver.local/code in your hosts file. mDNS succeeds resolving it because it's a valid and resolvable mDNS name.  In your second scenario (codemyserver/code &amp; search.domain codelocal/code) you use 1, 2, 3 (and 4). 'Files' fails because you have no entry codemyserver/code, mDNS fails because it's no valid mDNS name. DNS (search domains) fails because you don't have a DNS-server with a SOA record for .local in your network (as well as DNS).  So just enter codesudo nano /etc/hosts/code in Terminal and add the line:  precode a.x.y.z      myserver /code/pre  (a.x.y.z= IP-number of your server) and it should work. If you are really lazy even an 'a' as name might be sufficient. But don't use single numbers (like 1 or 123) because then ssh might try to connect to 0.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.123. At least ping connects to 0.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.123.  <answer164140> @klanomath's answer explains perfectly how name resolution works, why your attempt did not and how you can create a pseudonym on your local machine for a static address through the code/etc/hosts/code file.  However, if codemyserver/code does not have a static address but rather is assigned one dynamically (e.g. by DHCP), then code/etc/hosts/code is not ideal as one must find some way to keep the address therein updated.  For SSH, one can instead create an alias in code/etc/ssh/ssh_config/code (system-wide) or code~/.ssh/config/code (user-specific):  precodeHost myserver     HostName myserver.local /code/pre  Then you can simply codessh myserver/code.  <comment192319> Perfect answer. I now understand name resolution on OS X and have also added my server to /etc/hosts so I can access it quickly. Thank you very much. <comment192320> @introiboad you are welcome ;-) I try to improve the answer later but i have to dig into Apple mDNS & DNS deeper first. In fact it's much more complex and there are some changes between the various systems 10.3-10.10... <comment192332> Thanks for the tip. "myserver" does have a static IP address (it's a Mac Mini acting as both a backup server and media player). If I ever decide to switch to DHCP though, I will the alias functionality you describe.
