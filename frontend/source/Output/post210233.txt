Should the S be a capital letter in the iPhone S series? <body> For the iPhone S series, should the S next to the number be a capital letter or not? (iPhone 6s or iPhone 6S.)  <answer210234> Going to http://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/ and scrolling until you can find a reference in the regular text on the page finds the s is not capitalized.  <answer210235> On the official Apple site it's always written with small "strongs/strong".  You can also use iPhone 6 ;)  <comment253719> iPhone 6s is a mouthful. <comment253724> Thanks, can't believe I didn't think of that.
