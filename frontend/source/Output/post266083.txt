Macbook pro 13" retina display (early 2015 model A1502) battery not charging <body> I bought a Macbook pro 13" retina display early 2015 and after about 13 months of intense use:  ul libattery stoped charging./li listill work when connected to the charger./li liThe magsafe led is red./li liBattery Installed:   Yes./li liAmperage (mA):   0./li liVoltage (mV):    8222./li liCycle Count: 294./li liCondition:   Replace Now./li liStuck with 0% battery./li liOpened the mac and 2 cells of the battery seems to be "stuffed"./li liCharge Remaining (mAh):  0./li liFully Charged:   No./li liCharging:    No. (charger connected)/li liFull Charge Capacity (mAh):  815./li liI already reseted SMC./li /ul  Do you guys know if it is a "replace the battery" problem or a "logic board" problem? What is the source of the problem? How can I fix?  <comment333694> have you taken it in to genius bar yet? Did they have any comment for this? <comment333695> Not yet. I bought it in the US during my exchange program. Now I am back to Brazil and there is only one official apple store in my state and is really far. But I am planing to go there next week to check their opinion about it. <comment333778> First things first - did you buy any kind of warranty on it? In addition have you called the Apple support line then? Cause I have had luck there as well and you dont need to be in the country for that? Finally check if there is a support line in brazil which you can call instead of having to make that journey? <comment333794> My 1 year warranty is already over. I did not know that, I will try to call them this week. Here in brazil they give support for products that have warrant, I already checked on the website. Thanks. <comment333798> Sure check on that- additionally if you bought this via a credit card, then check their policies as well. Like my card automatically gives me extended warranties if I make a purchase with that card, you have to look through it but it might help.
