Is there a way to record a video call on the ipad? Video call could be w/ Skype, Facetime, etc <body> I need to record a video call to someone on an iPad.  Any suggestions on what /how to do that?  I'd be using a Windows PC or iPad2 on my end.  <answer179892> First result on Google for "windows record ipad screen". These only work for Airplay-compatible apps. If you want to record anything on the iPad screen the only official way is using QuickTime on a Mac.
