Tapping 'open' after downloading app doesn't work <body> I download apps from the App Store and when it says open I tap open and it won't open. What do I do?  I already created a iCloud account and everything is still the same.  <comment169297> Oh boy, can you please make some effort in grammar checking your question? <comment169317> Please help us to help you. What app did you download, what is your hardware and what software.
