How do I make my 1.5 GHz PowerBook G4 boot from a USB stick? <body> I actually want to boot Linux but since that is not working I'm thinking some one might know on the Apple end.   If there's a way to boot Mac from a USB stick, then booting another operating system should not be impossible.  Do I need to use an Apple bootloader to trick my PowerBook into thinking it's booting Mac OS and then slip in the Linux disc or what?  <answer11129> I've heard that using Super Duper works well for this.  I imagine if that's the case, then Carbon Copy Cloner should work as well.  Deploy the image onto the USB through one of those utilities and you should be golden.  Find Super Duper! here.  <answer19958> I have done this many times since I posted this question.   ol listrongCreate usb stick like this:/strong  precodesudo dd if=/&lt;path to iso file&gt;/&lt;name of iso file&gt; of=/&lt;path to usb stick&gt; bs=32768 conv=notrunc,noerror,sync /code/pre/li listrongPut the USB stick into your Mac and press the power button while holding down kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdO/kbd+kbdF/kbd/strong/li listrongAt the prompt, type the following:/strong  precodeboot usb1/disk@1:,\\yaboot /code/pre/li /ol  strongNote/strong: If you are booting linux then use code,\\yaboot/code, but if you are booting a Mac OS use code,\\tbxi/code.  strongNote 2/strong: If your stick is in the right side of the machine, then you need to do this:  precodeboot usb0/disk@1:,\\yaboot /code/pre  strongNote 3/strong: If these commands don't work, then there is most likely a problem with your media or iso file.  I have found that Ubuntu, Debian, and openSUSE work great. I cannot get Fedora or Gentoo to boot this way yet. My optical drive does not work anymore, so this is how I install OS X on my machine. I made a live USB stick of the OS X install disc this way.  <answer106168> precodeboot usb1/disk@1:,\\yaboot /code/pre  OR  precodeboot usb1/disk@1:,\\tbxi /code/pre  is emnot/em a complete command. You need to list a partition number after the ":"  for example, if you are trying to install on a Mac, you will need to enter something like this  precodeboot usb1/disk@1:10,\\tbxi /code/pre  (where "10" is the partition number of the usb drive, disk@1 in this example).  To find out the partition number where OSX is located on your USB, use Disk Utility, Click on the partition you set up with OS X and then R-click or kbdCtrl/kbd-kbdL/kbd click and select "Information".  You will get something to the effect of: codedisk1s10/code  codes10/code is the partition number. Refer to the example above.  <answer160252> This thread is old, but i want to add some information that may be useful:  On a Powerbook G4 A1138 (1,67 Ghz 15" late 2005) the above instructions didn't work out of the box. I used the finnix ppc rescue ISO, dumped with dd to the usb key.brbr b1.)/b OF creates the devalias codeud/code for the usb key in the bleft/b port. This codeud/code alias maps to code/pci@f2000000/usb@15/disk@1/codebrbr b2.)/b You can call yaboot with codeboot ud:2,\\yaboot/code - but then the kernel will panic because it still searches his initrd + rootfs somewhere at codecd:2,/ .../code (the codecd/code  alias is hardcoded inside files like ofboot.b, yaboot.conf ... on the ISO)brbr b3.)/b Quick and dirty workaround: overwrite the codecd/code alias in OF with the path to your USB Key (copy the path from the codeud/code alias): codedevalias cd /pci@f2000000/usb@15/disk@1/codebrbr b4.)/b Now boot with codeboot cd:2,\\yaboot/codebrbr b5.)/b No problem anymore with hardcoded codecd/code alias - it's now poiting to your USB Key. You can just choose a default kernel entry - code*finnix/code in my case - and it will boot properly.brbr The alias will be resetted to default at the next cold boot and thus you will have to repeat the procedure for every USB-boot.  <answer227536> I've just been booting my PPC from an external USB cdrom drive, using the same command as above :   boot usb1/disk@1:,\\yaboot  because my internal cdrom drive is a bit old and does'nt read successfuly the entire install on the CD!

Love these old threads and old machines!  <comment11636> So using dd in the terminal has problems? <comment11637> And I don't need to partition my USB stick or instal yaboot etc? <comment11643> I wouldn't mess around with firmware/bootloaders, personally.  I've just heard from colleagues in the business (I am an Apple-certified tech) that this works well. <comment65775> Thank you for your answer, I've found it really useful. Now, I don't know if you found out how to boot Gentoo same way, but I did, so I wanter to share the link that helped me do that. Here it is. Hope it helps! http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/LiveUSB_on_PPC#Boot_from_Open_Firmware <comment88537> thank you so much! this is the best "tutorial" regarding this topic i was able to find. just successfully bootet xubuntu 12.04 mini install iso from USB, because my superdrive in my beloved powerbook is broken. <comment148256> Got there while trying to boot a Ubuntu from a USB stick. You can also type `dev / ls` to get a tree-shaped listing of devices and see which `usb` has a `disk` leaf node. Even if the path to that node looks like `/usb@1b/disk@1` (notice extra `@` and `b`), the correct path still looks like `boot usb1/disk@1:2,\\yaboot` <comment187993> SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner are good tools to copy bootable systems, but the issue in this question is hinged on PowerBook G4 models not formally allowing USB boot. So the cleanest OS copy created won’t boot on these systems without extra firmware adjustments as outlined in the above answers. <comment187997> @JakeGould I see, thanks! <comment188001> @Harv You’re welcome.
