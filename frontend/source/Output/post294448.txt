iPod touch 3rd and 4th generation <body> I tried to download Downcast as Jawa and no luck as it's stating I need iOS 9 to download Downcast. I need something for offline music which I was hoping I could get by using podcast app however for that I need iOS 10. Since it's an older iPod touch, i cannot upgrade the software past iOS 6.1.6. What are my options for music offline? I don't have my laptop with me to connect to iTunes and only the iPod. I won't have my laptop with me for another 5 days. Thank you. Please assist.   <comment372945> Please [edit] to use a title which summarises the problem you are having, rather than just listing the device you are using, so that others can find the question.
