How can I format a USB drive on a Mac so that it works on all old PCs as well? <body> I've tried FAT32 but old PCs won't read it.  I could try NTFS but then Macs would treat it as read-only.  I'm pretty sure I've seen USB sticks that work on Macs and PCs but I don't have any to hand so can't check the format.  Surprisingly, this doesn't seem to have been asked before, although questions about formatting things on PCs have been.  strongIs there a specific format or formatting procedure I need to use?/strong (And, are there specific Windows versions that are known for being restrictive in what they support? I've taken USB sticks to friends' houses who have old PCs but that's not very scientific.)  <comment275984> I had always used Fat32. Which kind of old PCs won't read it? <comment275990> "Old" is pretty subjective when it comes to computers. So, to echo what @Mattia asks, what can you tell the community about the PCs in question? <comment275993> You can use the command called `newfs_msdos`. <comment276110> Re: duplicate flag @bmike - the nominated duplicate asks "How do I format a USB drive on a PC so that I can use it on a PC?" whereas this question asks "How can I format a USB drive on a Mac so that I can use it on a PC *and a Mac*?" <comment276113> @buildsucceeded the answer uses Disk Utility so it's primarily about OS X. I'll edit the tags/title so that you can see how the answer applies to you.
