Problem with external monitor quality! <body> I'm trying to connect my MacBook Pro 15'' Late 2012 to an external Full HD TV/Monitor via a Mini Displayport to HDMI cable. The quality is not good at all! It looks blurry, especially the font! Does anyone know how to solve this problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7b8c.jpg" alt="Here are my Specs, hopefully it helps"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D90mZ.jpg" alt="Here my System Report"  <comment230052> How big is the TV? If it's notably larger than your monitor, 30" or above, then it's bound to be less sharp. <comment230054> it's not that big it's a 24" <comment230055> It's still going to be commensurately fuzzier than the same pixel count in a 15" screen. It's also a TV, not a monitor - they really are nowhere near as sharp. <comment230060> I've set it to be 1080p, it's the only monitor i'm using right now <comment230092> 1080p isn't really high-res for a computer monitor. It's going to look a little bit fuzzy. 1080p works for movies whose blurriness can be somewhat obscured by the fact that you're not reading text, or anything else that requires high-accuracy to see clearly. Movies accept a certain level of blurriness, so for them, 1080p is fine. On a computer, you can go quite a bit higher. <comment230114> I know but still my MacBook is a 1440 x 900 and looks better than this external display. I've also tried different HDMI cables and resolution settings but still no luck with that either. <comment230146> It worked!! but i've used a VGA adaptor instead of the HDMI it looks perfect in full HD
