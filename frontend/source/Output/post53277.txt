What's the "@"mark at the file description?  <body> I installed princexml for Mac. With codels -alF/code, I have code-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 prosseek  admin  14190120 Jun  8 16:11 prince*/code. What's the meaning of code@/code in code-rwxr-xr-x@/code?  And when I tried to execute the binary, I got code./prince: Operation not permitted/code error message. Does this have anything with code@/code?  <answer53296> It means that the file has extended attributes. To see these attributes, run codexattr -l file/code, to see the extended attributes of a particular file, or codels -l@/code to see the extended attributes of all files in a particular directory.  See the man page for xattr as well.  <comment60933> The error message is unrelated to the @. But I don't have a guess on why it does occur. Did you untar/unzip the prince-macosx.tar.gz in Terminal or via double click in Finder? <comment60936> @patrix: I did click in Finder (PathFinder to be precise) to open the tar file, after untag it in command line, everything works fine. <comment88016> In Super User: [what does the @ mean on the output of ls on os x terminal?](http://superuser.com/q/155458/84988)
