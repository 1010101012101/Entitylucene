rEFInd not showing macOS partition, just Ubuntu <body> A week ago I installed Ubuntu gnome in dual boot on my MacBook Pro mid 2012 (macOS Sierra). I followed the installation guide, disabled SIP in Recovery Mode, installed rEFInd and everything went well.   Today I wanted to go back to macOS and when I rebooted the system rEFInd did not show up, instead there was just Ubuntu loading. So I booted to Recovery Mode and reinstalled rEFInd (from that console I was able to locate my macOS files).  After rebooting I was able to load rEFInd page, but I cannot find the macOS "icon" to boot the system, just the Ubuntu one. Any hint on what may be the problem?  <answer296341> Try to reinstall refind on ubuntu side.  <comment374275> Slightly unclear. Does this mean: since installing Ubuntu you always booted Ubuntu and only after a week you wanted to run macOS again, which then failed? Hint: within Ubuntu you updated the boot-manager `grub`? Since booting Mac hardware with rEFInd does not strictly require grub we need more details on your (linux-) setup and how rEFInd (option " `--ownhfs` "?)  was installed.
