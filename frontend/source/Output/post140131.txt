Does OneNote for Mac support graphics tablet input? <body> I was thinking of purchasing a Wacom Bamboo Pad for note taking at college. I am going to an engineering school, and often typing isn't the primary method I would like to use to enter equations, data, or text.  Does OneNote for Mac support this? I know the Windows version does.  <answer140212> Running OneNote on Mavericks here, and right now it does not support tablet input in the way you have described (I wish it did). A possible compromise is to run Windows and OneNote in a virtual machine (or BootCamp), but it really depends on your needs and what youâ€™re willing to put up with.
