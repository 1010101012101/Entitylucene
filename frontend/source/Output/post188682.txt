Sleep timeout missing from the energy saver preferences <body> I have two Macbook Pros running on Yosemite. The first one is a 17 incher from 4 years ago. I'm able to set the time that it sleeps. The second one is a 15 incher retina made this year. In its energy saver section, I don't see a way to set the sleep time. It only shows the display time. How do I make both slider controls show up on this new Macbook Pro?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIkSV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer188683> h2Deliberately Removed/h2  Apple have removed the strongComputer/strong slider from the Energy Saver settings. This is deliberate.  The decision is related to Apple's introduction of improved hardware, Power Nap support, and the engineers' belief that OS X is best placed to manage the computer's power state.  If you would like to see this slider return, provide feedback to Apple.  h3Downloads and Other Long Running Tasks/h3  OS X will stay awake during most long running tasks.  The behaviour will depend on the software downloading the file. Safari and Transmission, for example, both ask OS X to stay awake while a download is ongoing.  Applications need to lodge power assertions with OS X that explicitly stop the computer sleeping. You can see these assertions using the following codepmset/code command:  precodepmset -g assertions /code/pre  For older software, you can add this behaviour using the built-in command line tool caffeinate.  h3Third Party Alternatives/h3  Third party tools exist to supplement the Energy Saver settings. I created Power Manager and it can put your Mac to sleep after inactivity.  Other tools exist and you could probably create a script to also recreate this behaviour.  <answer245664> Basically, Safari will download the file but it will not go to sleep.   You can also check the box that says "Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off." I have that box unchecked;  power nap really, in this case, does help.  I've actually ended up answering one of my own questions by reading this thread.  <comment223407> Apparently it is a Haswell "feature" http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=17457370&postcount=11 <comment223456> @n1000 I didn't understand all that tech jargon in that article. Does that mean when my display sleeps, my computer also sleeps? What if I was downloading a huge file that would take 5 hours to complete? How would I make the display sleep after 15 minutes of activity, but still have the computer on so that the download is not cut off? <comment294341> I can't add a comment because I don't have sufficient reputation, so instead I'm forced to comment by adding an answer. When I discovered the "computer sleep" slider was missing, and then read the above description of why Apple deliberately chose to do this, I exasperatedly exclaimed "But now I have no control over how much time elapses before I am forced to enter a password to resume using the computer!". Well, it turns out Apple exposes that functionality in another section of the Settings app: Security & Privacy - General - Require password x minutes after sleep.
