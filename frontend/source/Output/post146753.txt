iOS 8 third-party keyboard for accentuated characters? <body> iOS 8 now supports third-party keyboards. I am pretty satisfied with Apple's default keyboard, however one thing is a hassle for me, as a French speaker : typing accentuated characters takes a stronglong/strong time, because you first have to touch for instance the letter "E" and then wait for the accentuated variants such as "é è ë..." to appear.  Hence my question : is there a third-party keyboard especially designed for quickly typing accentuated characters ?  <answer146800> iOS 8 (like iOS 7) on my iPad has a French keyboard called Accented AZERTY, where you type é by typing e and then the accent from the bottom row of keys.  This is a lot faster than holding down the e key for most people.  <comment172946> I think it's just a matter of time.  So far I have seen them for Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Georgian.  Someone will do French, German, Swedish, etc pretty soon. <comment173260> Thanks, it does 95% of what I need. A dedicated French keyboard (with accents) might however be ultimately better, especially on bigger screens (iPad or iPhone 6).
