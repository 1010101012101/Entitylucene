What is JishoPlus in iCloud storage? <body> I have storage for something called JishoPlus in my iCloud storage breakdown. I can't find anything definitive about it online. I know how to delete it (and I will), but what is it from?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ia5XP.png" alt="JishoPlus"  <answer52800> From the name it seems like some kind of Japanese-English Dictionary app. Did you install something like that?   <comment60396> Some other dictionaries, but nothing Japanese <comment60397> I see. Jisho is Japanese for Dictionary. Probably related
