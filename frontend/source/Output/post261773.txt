Can one MacBook charge another over USB-C? <body> When two 2016 MacBook Pros are connected over USB-C, can they transmit power?  Could an adapter look like a phone from one side but like a charger from the other, so that it would convince one MacBook to power another?  How does the 2016 MacBook Pro know to draw power when connected to a charger, but to provide power when connected to a phone?  I see that wattage is negotiated when they are first connected, but is who-charges-who also negotiated??  <answer261778> Technically it would be possible to emtrick/em the MacBook Pro to think another device is actually a different device to what it is (e.g. that a connected  MacBook is in fact an iPhone).  strongHowever, this would not achieve the goal of charging one MacBook from another MacBook./strong According to Apple:     MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016) and MacBook (13-inch, Late 2016, Four   Thunderbolt 3 Ports) can power two devices that use up to 15 watts,   and two more devices that use up to 7.5 watts. It doesn't matter which   side of your MacBook Pro that they're connected toâ€”power is delivered   on a first-come, first-served basis.   Source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207256  MacBooks emtypically/em require in the range of 55 watts to 90 watts of power in order to charge (depending on the model, e.g. the late-2016 13" MacBook Pros require 60 watts, while the 15" models require 85 watts).  As a result, the amount of power being delivered from the MBP via it's ThunderBolt ports would not be enough to charge another MacBook.  <comment327813> That page says "Using a power supply that doesn't provide sufficient power can result in slow or delayed charging. It's best to use the power supply that came with your Mac.".  I've used a 2013 Macbook Air 45W charger to charge a 2015 15" Retina Macbook Pro, which ships with a 85W charger, and it works, albeit slowly. <comment327814> Yes, using a 45W charger to charge a device that should have an 85W charger will result in a slow charge (as you've found). However that 45W charger provides about 53% of the recommended wattage, while the max amount of watts a late-2016 MBP can deliver via a single ThunderBolt port is 15W. That 15W is barely over 17.5% of what is recommended to charge your 2015 Retina MacBook Pro. This is likely to not slowly charge, but at best offer delayed charging (I suspect 'never' charge). Also, over time it's quite likely you will damage your MacBook Air charger.
