Can't encrypt SanDisk 8GB <body> I've formatted my SanDisk flash drive to a OSX Extended format with the GUID Partition Map.  But when I go to encrypt the drive I continually get this error:  "A partition, not a whole disk, is required for this operation."  The partition option in Disk Utility is not available for this drive. I'm using Disk Utility to format it.   I'm using OS X version 10.11.  <comment312734> Are you clicking on the partition you created and not the disk itself? <comment312735> @IronCraftMan I'm right clicking on the disk in the Finder menu and clicking 'Encrypt SanDisk 8GB'.
