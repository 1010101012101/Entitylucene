Switch Desktops by keyboard in macOS Sierra <body> As the title says, I want to be able to switch the desktops by only using the keyboard. I have 2 displays, my MacBook Pro and a monitor.   So far I've seen some solutions using codeSystem Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts/code, but all these are deprecated in macOS Sierra.  What I have tried:   How do I switch monitor focus with the keyboard?  Keyboard Shortcut to switch between multiple displays  <comment327944> It would be better if you pointed us to what those solutions were & explain why they no longer work for you. <comment327945> Edit done, thanks! <comment327946> I'm not on Sierra right now, but when I was all my Spaces were working just perfectly, so I suspect a configuration issue; system prefs  Mission control  Displays have separate spaces is one that people fall over a lot. If you have that set, you must have more Spaces than screens.
