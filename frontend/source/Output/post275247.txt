iPhoto gone missing <body> My iPhoto was transferred from my MacBook Air to my external hard drive (I'd run out of space on the MacBook). My external hard drive is now refusing to link to my computer. So I can't transfer photos from my camera to the MacBook,. What do I do? Can I reinstall iPhoto?iPhoto  <comment346190> I'm assuming that what was actually transferred to the external drive was your iPhoto Library and not the iPhoto app.  If so, then all the photos are stored within the library on your external drive. You will need to troubleshoot why you're drive isn't connecting to your MacBook Air in order to access the data.
