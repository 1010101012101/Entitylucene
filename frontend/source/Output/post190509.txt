Pop-ups in Chrome <body> Hi I'm using Chrome in a MBP and anytime that I click anywhere on the page I`m browsing, a pop-up opens and I cannot stop it. I have already tried with configuration of Chrome but it's useless.  <answer190511> Go to http://www.adwaremedic.com and download and install the Adware Medic software to remove the adware. It will search for the specific adware that usually gets installed from questionable websites, i.e. a website to stream a movie.   Once ran, the program will show you the file locations of the documents it is removing.  Otherwise, go to preferences- extensions in Google Chrome and remove anything you did not install. However, this will not remove any launchagents or launchdaemons or frameworks installed by the initial installation of the adware.
