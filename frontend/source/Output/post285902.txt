How do I enable the one-handed keyboard? <body> I would like to enable a different keyboard layout for one-handed use. I know it's possible, since it was mentioned at WWDC 2017, but how do I do it?  Settings doesnâ€™t have an option to enable a one-handed keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sgJJZ.jpg" width="280"   In the Keyboards list, there is no one-handed keyboard either.  <answer285903> strongHold down on the emoji button and on the last menu item, pick the right or left option./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zVuzbl.jpg" alt="Picker for keyboard layouts"  The 3 keyboard icons are for enabling the one-handed layout.  If you pick the left option, you'll be able to use the keyboard with only your left hand, and the same is true with the right option. The center option makes the keyboard two-handed again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChUhGm.png" alt="Table of keyboard options"  Here's an example of the right-handed keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U7YI1l.png" alt="Right-handed keyboard"  <answer295701> I have same issue, but i found the solution that display zoom out on iPhone and set standard view. I checked out so one-handed keypad setting showing up. Source: howtoisolve.com  <comment360944> On supported devices only...
