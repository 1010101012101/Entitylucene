When I open the lid of my MacBook Pro (late 2014 - macOS Sierra), it crashes <body> I have a MacBook Pro late 2014 - macOS Sierra which was installed on 23rd of December 2016.  I had few issues with the iOS Sierra installation such as:  ul liInstallation not completed or moving forward for a very long time (i had to restart)/li lithe laptop started then but kept on restarting and trying to complete the installation until it was completed (restarted like 15 times)/li /ul  after all it was installed successfully.  When the laptop is on power (cord is connected) and I close the lid of my MacBook Pro, then I open it everything seems fine and the MacBook Pro wakes up normally.  However, if I disconnect the cord and I am on battery mode only, and only after a certain time which I am not able to to determine, if I open the lid of my macbook pro after putting it to sleep, the Apple icon appears and it starts up (it crashes). I am not able to determine how long it needs to be on sleep mode to do that.  Let's put it this way. If I close the lid while on battery mode for only half an hour or an hour, then I open it. Everything seems to be fine.  If I leave it closed over night or the entire afternoon, then it crashes once the lid is opened  Please note that this has started since I installed the macOS Sierra.  I do not currently have a warranty on the laptop.  Here is a snapshot of how the logs look like:  precode-------- **crash report** from: com.apple.driver.airport.brcm##### --------  [1][0] apple80211Request Get "APPLE80211_IOC_PHY_MODE" rejected while _powerState:0, pid[0]'kernel_task'  Dec 29 23:06:56.186839 -0500 000001.314057 Brcm4360&lt;D&gt;[1] [0x46635611607a055b][1][0] apple80211Request Get "ID:80" rejected while _powerState:0, pid[0]'kernel_task'  Dec 29 23:06:56.186867 -0500 000001.314085 Brcm4360&lt;D&gt;[2] [0x46635611607a055b][1][0] BRCM tunables:  Dec 29 23:06:56.186872 -0500 000001.314091 Brcm4360&lt;D&gt;[3] [0x46635611607a055b][1][0]   pullmode[1] txringsize[  256] txsendqsize[0] reapmin[   32] reapcount[  128] /code/pre  <comment334563> Could you detail what those issues with the installation were? - You could try reinstalling macOS Sierra (it won't delete your apps and data) to see if that is a quick fix. <comment334565> thanks for your response, i mentioned the issues i had in the post. if i can avoid reinstalling the iOS that would be great. <comment334566> Why do you want to avoid reinstalling? - Have you investigated the issues you had during installation? - Do you have issues using the Mac now? (besides the awake from deep sleep issue) <comment334568> no i did not investigate the issues i had during the installation. i do not have any issues with the mac other than this issue. the crash report specifically talks about the airport trying to do something, so my investigation was mostly about the airport that i have on the mac. i can definitely reinstall the iOS if that is the solution. i am trying to avoid that cause my mac is almost full. i have like 5 GB left on it , its a 129 GB mac. do you think the best way to go about this is to reinstall the iOS ? <comment334569> It is easy to try and it won't take up extra disk space so I don't see the problem there. <comment334570> absolutely i dont mind , just to make sure. i should be redoing the regular reinstallation procedure with Command+R and then reinstalling the iOS, no extra steps involved correct? <comment334596> Yes, no extra steps required. Boot with Cmd+R, select Reinstall macOS and follow the instructions. DO NOT choose to erase your disk with Disk Utility before reinstalling ofcourse. Note the system is not called "iOS" - the name is "macOS". <comment334701> i have reinstalled MacOS Sierra <comment334702> i am still having the same issue :(
