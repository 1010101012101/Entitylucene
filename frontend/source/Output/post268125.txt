Closing the side pane of Safari on iPad <body> In Safari on my iPad, I'm trying to get rid of the sidebar that shows my bookmarks as it's getting in the way. I did click on the book button which got rid of first side bar but it brought me to the favorites sidebar. Hitting the blue book button doesn't work this time, and I just can't seem to get the sidebar to go away.  <comment336563> What happens when you select a bookmark in the bookmarks sidebar? Does the sidebar go away? I suggest you quit Safari by double clicking the home button, then swiping Safari up. Then power-cycle the iPad.
