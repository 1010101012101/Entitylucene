Hiding files in iOS <body> I have some videos on my iPhone 5S and I don't know if there is a way of hiding them like in other OSs (e.g., Symbian) or not.   Does anyone know how to hide files (such as video or photo files) in iOS?  <answer107746> There is no such feature by default on iOS.   if you want to hide directly videos or photos in the camera roll, that's not possible without a jailbreak.   After a fast search, i found some app that lock the access to their content like this one. But you have to move the files to these apps.   With a jailbroken device, it's much simpler you can do it from the built-in terminal.   <comment126333> OK & thank you. My iOS version is 7.0.3, you think how much time I should wait for a good jailbreak for that? <comment126334> You may ask this to the teams who works on this. I have no idea nor an influence on that. <comment126335> OK. Thanks for your reply. <comment126468> I did that since you wanted me to do that!
