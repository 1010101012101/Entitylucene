Teach AutoCorrect short words with umlauts <body> I use an English keyboard layout on OS X because I program a lot.  When I type the occasional German umlaut, I can do kbdalt + u + (a|u|o)/kbd or can I press and hold a u o.  The latter is really buggy in almost all applications except Apple Mail.  My favourite approach though, is to simply type "ue", "oe", or "ae". These are acceptable replacements for umlauts in German (for e.g. crosswords).   However, when I type a text like that, AutoCorrect will correct the longer words ("ueberschreiben" becomes "端berschreiben"), but not the shorter ones "ueber" doesn't become "端ber", presumably owing to the amount of information it needs to recognise a mis-spelled word.  Having a text with some umlauts as "ue" and some as "端" obviously looks odd. I don't want to turn AutoCorrect off.  Is there  ol lia way to teach AutoCorrect what to correct to? I tried using the dialog box to change "ueber" to "端ber", but it didn't learn it/li lia text replacement file with all common "long-form umlaut" ("ue") words so that they get replaced with the proper ones? I don't want to make it myself, this is a big task. The reason this is option (2): AutoCorrect has language recognition, text replacement doesn't./li lia way to make AutoCorrect more trigger-happy (probably a bad idea) or understanding of German typers with English keyboards somehow?/li /ol  I don't want a suggestion for tools that change any "ue", "ae" or "oe" to the respective umlauts, I regularly type in English and in German there are words that contain these characters without them being umlauts.
