Creating preview and icon for screenshots <body> I would like to make this code to automatically create preview and icon so it looks nice in Finder and so i don't have to wait my graphics app to create these things when i first time open in browse view. Thanks  precodedo shell script "screencapture -Wimxo " &amp; quoted form of ("/Users/Maccie/Desktop/shot.png") /code/pre  <answer89309> This seems to work.  It uses your code to capture the image, although I have made it so any user can use it.  It then uses an edited version of a script I found on macosxautomation website for image events  precodeset homeFolder to path to home folder     set imageName to "shot.png"     set saveFolderPath to homeFolder &amp; "Desktop:" &amp; imageName as string     do shell script "screencapture -Wimxo " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of saveFolderPath     --set the target_path to the saveFolderPath as Unicode text     delay 1     try         tell application "Image Events"               -- start the Image Events application             launch             -- open the image file             set this_image to open saveFolderPath             set type_ to file type of this_image             -- save in same  file with icon             save this_image as type_ in saveFolderPath with icon             -- purge the open image data             close this_image          end tell     on error error_message         display dialog error_message buttons {"Cancel"} default button 1     end try /code/pre  <comment104769> Thanks this works, but... I take many times screenshots in **very** fast pace and i think using Image Events might be too slow especially because in my own old code there is additional code which is run between each shots so IE might slow it too much. Is there any way to change quality level of preview and icon? Does this additional save by Image Events affect to picture quality? <comment104771> Hi, there most probably is. The only other way maybe using third party CLI like imagmagik http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php or exiftool http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ if I had sometime I probably could look at writing something native but I think it would not be soon <comment104784> It's not clear what you're asking here.
