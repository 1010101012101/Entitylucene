To upgrade to OS X Mountain Lion, is it better to do a fresh install? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Advantage of doing a clean Install of Mountain Lion?       Many of us will upgrade our existing machines to Mountain Lion, which should be out tomorrow. In my case, to be specific, I have new Macs so I don't have files to keep. In general, is there a preferred way to upgrade for power users? E.g. doing a fresh install instead of whatever default upgrade solution Apple provides?
