First MacBook - am stuck <body> I've unboxed a MacBook Pro and am stuck at the very beginning. These are the two screens that loop - I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3dpPT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfVGH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer257487> Apple offers free support at 1-888-APL-CARE for all new hardware. But, you seem to be seeing the screens that guide you to use a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse.  What happens if you disconnect everything connected to the Mac and then open the lid of the MacBook Pro and type?   If you can't get logged in, a quick call to support might be the best thing to do.  <comment321510> It's telling you to turn on your bluetooth mouse and CD/DVD player. <comment321513> Thanks - but I don't have any of them <comment321518> Take a look at [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/192464/88313).  It's similar but not a duplicate.  The answers might help. <comment321527> Do you have access to a wired USB mouse and keyboard? They don't even have to be Apple branded. <comment321541> Hi. thanks guys. I went back to the store and they replaced the laptop. <comment321542> Thanks. I went back to the store and they replaced it. <comment321593> @fsb that last one is a keyboard, not cd player. <comment321595> A keyboard?  Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that, thx.
