Use TextEdit's AutoCorrect everywhere (especially in Google Chrome) <body> I really love typing in TextEdit. It seems to correct all my typos and so saves time in editing.  Is there anyway I can get this functionality to work in all applications, especially on Google Chrome's text fields.   I've searched everywhere, but I can only find articles about Chrome's own built in Auto Correct (which isn't available on the Mac yet).  supOS X 10.9/sup  <answer143254> TextEdit's autocorrect is actually strongOS X's autocorrect/strong, which is used in every system text box in the OS, in every application, including 3rd-party applications.
