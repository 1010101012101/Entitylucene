How to I "edit as new" with Apple Mail? <body> I have a mail message where I typed the email address from a business card. Unfortunately I made a typo, so it bounced. I'd like to open the mail and edit it as if it were a new mail without "Fwd" or "Re" and all that, but I can't find an option do to that with Apple Mail.   Is it possible?  <answer238892> Go to sent messages.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ehEWf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Right click the message and click "Send again"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YbDrh.png" alt="enter image description here"  This will open the message as you wanted.  <comment293045> Indeed! I hadn't chosen that option, as I didn't want to send it again without edits (my fear of doing that drew me to the irrational conclusion that that is what "Send Again" would do!). <comment293047> Nope, it just pulls up the editor again: doesn't send until you hit send :) <comment293083> @drevicko Don't forget to mark it as solved!
