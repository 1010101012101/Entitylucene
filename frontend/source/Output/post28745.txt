How do I delete all Terminal mail? <body> I set up a cronjob a long time ago that now doesn't exist. Whenever I open up Terminal, it now says "You have mail". I have something like 100 messages that all say the same thing. How do I mass delete all of the messages?  <answer28747> Launch the Terminal mail app with:  precode$ mail /code/pre  You'll see a list of all your messages. From the mail prompt, do  precode? delete * ? q /code/pre  And that should be it. Make sure do to the codeq/code after the codedelete */code command, that saves the changes to disk.  <answer28837> You may also go the direct route and just run code: &gt; /var/mail/$USER/code to empty the mail file.  PS: Deleting the mail file requires sudo, just setting it to empty is enough.  <comment33064> I wasn't even aware an MTA was built into OS X. Though now that I think about it, frankly I'm not surprised. <comment44066> @JasonSalaz I forgot to ask you, what's an MTA? <comment44069> Mail Transfer Agent. When in doubt, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_Transfer_Agent). I know of, at least, MTAs, MSAs, MDAs, and MUAs. <comment348329> At first I didn't know what mail app mean. To anyone who is having same trouble, "It is a command". Just go type it in terminal and you will get an interactive app running there. +1 Thank you
