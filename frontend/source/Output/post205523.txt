Unlike all the posts I have seen, my MBR Partition table shows 3 partitions and the GPT partition shows 4...not sure what to do next. Help?  <comment247914> You could start by posting what you saw. I would prefer you posted the output from the commands: `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0`, `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` and `diskutil list`.
