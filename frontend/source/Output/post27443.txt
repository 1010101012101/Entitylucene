Showing hidden files in specific directories? <body> I use this command quite often to show hidden files on my machine:   precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES /code/pre  Is there a way to show all hidden files only in specific directories. E.g. I want to be able to see stuff like .ssh   However I don't want my desktop and every folder to show this damn .DS_Store files. Is there a trick to so?  thank you  <answer27444> If you want to hide specific files/folders from Finder (and any Open/Save dialogs) there is always  precodechflags hidden FILENAME /code/pre  If, on the other hand, you only want to make specific dot-files/directories (like .ssh or .bashrc) visible in Finder, you may be better of with creating non-dotted symlinks  precodeln -s .bashrc bashrc ln -s .ssh ssh /code/pre  and using them to access the files where needed.
