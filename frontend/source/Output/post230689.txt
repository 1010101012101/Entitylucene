Prioritize Wired Earbuds Over Bluetooth? <body> I have a somewhat humorous but annoying problem. I'll on the phone using the standard wired earbuds, then my wife starts the car in our garage downstairs. Since the phone is paired to the car, the audio automatically switches, interrupting my call and playing it to my startled wife in the car.   The interruption to the conversation and the ensuing confusion make this about as aggravating as a dropped call.  Is there any way to prioritize the wired headset over the car? I know I could turn off Bluetooth every time I make a phone call, or unpair from the car, but those are both pretty cumbersome.    (Using iOS 9.2.1 on an iPhone 6s)  <comment281596> Haha, I have the same problem. My phone is connected to the BT in both our cars and the car last started steals the BT connection every time. I have not found a way around it. It works great when I am out with my BT headphones then get in the car as it switches automatically for uninterrupted listening, but when she starts her car it always steal it. Turning the BT off and back on steals it back.
