How can I move fast in CLI in Mac? <body> In linux in CLI I can press ALT + F or ALT + B to move back and forth in terms of words and not one character at a time.br Is this available in Mac?br There is no ALT and I tried Control + F, Fn + F, Command + F  but it does not work.br BTW I am using the default console installed.  <answer119916> There are a number of ways to skin this cat.  Firstly, there is an kbdALT/KBD key, but depending on the age of your Mac/keyboard is may be called kbdOption/kbd or look like kbd⌥/kbd.  Using kbdALT/KBD+kbd◀︎/KBD or kbd▶︎/KBD will move a word at a time using a default shell in the default codeterminal/code app.  Secondly, you can tell your shell of choice to use alternate methods.  If you have ever used codevi/code and are used to its weird methods of navigation kbdw/KBD to move forward a word, kbdb/KBD to go back,kbdW/KBD to move forward a sentence and so on, then you can tell it to use those instead by typing codeset -o vi/code into your shell, now the first method doesn't work, and the weirdy codevi/code method is used instead.  In addition, in codeSettings &gt; Settings &gt; Keyboard/code (on Mavericks at least) you can tick this little fella to bring back your kbdALT/KBD+kbdF/KBD behaviour:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T46Ag.png" width="500" title="Terminal Preferences"  There are probably way more methods too, it depends on your shell and your shell options basically.
