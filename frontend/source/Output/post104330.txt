List view in Apps section of iTunes? <body> I've got two mac and both are running last version of OS X and iTunes but there's a little difference that I hate and I don't know how to solve:  These are the possible views of the Apps section in iTunes of one Mac:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dRlBm.png" alt="All; iPhone/iPod touch; iPad; List; Updates"    …and these on the other one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m5ZHC.png" alt="All; iPhone/iPod touch; iPad; Updates"    Trouble is that list view would be very useful and I don't know hot to get it on the second Mac too - is there somebody who has an idea?  EDIT: Same trouble even in Mavericks, even in Movies and Books (in iBook), always only in a Mac, on the other Mac everything works fine...   <answer107932> iTunes (in menù bar)  Preferences, then General  Show list views for all media. This setting works for iBook too!  <comment126569> well, it "should" be there. which exact versions of itunes, ibooks and os x do you have an both Macs? Try to delete iTunes and reinstall it. <comment126582> Good catch! Please post the solution as answer, so this question appears answered throughout the site. Cheers. <comment126587> Good idea!! Thank you!
