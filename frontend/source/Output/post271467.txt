WD external drive won't mount in OSX - partition map rebuild? <body> I have a WD Mybook Studio 500gb that will not mount. I've tried every possible option in Disk Utility and it see the drive (unlike finder), but won't mount the partition. I also tried plugging it in to a PC and again W10 didn't see the drive, but I could perform diagnostics on it via WD's tool (but no fix in sight).  I did some digging with with testdisk and the data is intact, no errors, I can see the file structure on the data partition etc but the partition map/table has tons of errors and I believe this is the cause of the problem - the data is there but the computer can't access it due to a corrupt partition map.  Here's what I get in terminal when looking at the drive info:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Internal HD             255.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB      disk0s3        /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk2    1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS General DATA            500.0 GB   disk2s3 /code/pre  And the second part for the drive in question:  precode$ diskutil info /dev/disk2s3 Device Identifier:        disk2s3 Device Node:              /dev/disk2s3 Part of Whole:            disk2 Device / Media Name:      Apple_HFS_Untitled_1  Volume Name:              General DATA Escaped with Unicode:     General%FF%FE%20%00DATA  Mounted:                  No  File System Personality:  HFS+ Type (Bundle):            hfs Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended Journal:                  Unknown (not mounted) Owners:                   Disabled  Partition Type:           Apple_HFS OS Can Be Installed:      No Media Type:               Generic Protocol:                 FireWire SMART Status:             Not Supported Volume UUID:              88071423-C35F-3BAA-BEE6-E3A3B3D9948F  Total Size:               500.0 GB (499973603328 Bytes) (exactly 976510944 512-Byte-Units) Volume Free Space:        0 B (0 Bytes) (exactly 0 512-Byte-Units) Device Block Size:        512 Bytes  Read-Only Media:          No Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (not mounted) Ejectable:                Yes  Whole:                    No Internal:                 No /code/pre  Can anyone help with advice on how to rebuild the apple partition map? I think this can be done with testdisk but I can't seem to fumble my way to the correct answer? by the way, I need to access the data on the drive, not just reformat and repurpose the hardware.  Help!  <answer271477> Seems like you need the following: Fixing my external hard drive&#39;s partition map  The fact that it's external shouldn't make a difference to you.  What happens when you try to mount it?  eg.  precodediskutil mount /dev/disk2s3 /code/pre     alex@smiley:~|â‡’  diskutil mount Usage:   diskutil mount [readOnly]   [-mountPoint Path] DiskIdentifier|DeviceNode Mount will mount the   volume in the "standard" place (/Volumes), unless an optional mount   point is specified.   The error you get should point you to your problem.  <comment341345> Thanks. I get this:      Volume on disk4s3 failed to mount      If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option <comment341417> Did you try that? diskutil mount readOnly /dev/disk4s3 <comment341495> Yep, still tells me disk can't be mounted. I believe the partition map is damaged to the point it won't mount at all, so I basically need to rebuild or replace, but keeping the actual data intact.
