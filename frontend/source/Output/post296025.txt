Find out google account connected to authenticator app on IPhone? <body> Given an IPhone with the google authenticator app installed. How can one find out what google account is linked to the authenticator app?  The goal is to backup the authenticator and move it to another device.  <comment373847> I don't think you can move the authenticator to another device. I've always heard that you have to revoke the app on the old device and re-authenticate on the new device. Have you checked with Google? <comment373848> How can I revoke and reauthenticate if I don't know the google account ? I couldn't find any info at google.
