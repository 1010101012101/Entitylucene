Cross opening URLs between computer and mobile phone? <body> I am looking for a solution that would allow me to cross-open an URL between computer (OS X) and phone (iPhone).  Here is the use case: using the iphone to barcode scan an QR code that opens an URL but I do want to open this URL on the computer, not on the phone.  How can I achieve this?  <answer134513> You can enable iCloud and use the iCloud tabs feature of Safari. On all the connected devices you will see the open tabs of the others.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OARjh.png" alt="enter image description here"  See emSet up and use iCloud Tabs/em  <comment195679> Firefox has a similar feature that works cross-platform, for people with Android phones, say. You must login to Firefox on the browsers (one time only) and select "Send Tab to Devices".
