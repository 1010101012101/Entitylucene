Disable auto-update of Top Sites in Safari <body> How do I disable the auto-updating of the Top Sites in Safari?  I don't want to turn the feature off altogether, I just want to prevent auto-update.  I know this may seem like an attempt to defeat the purpose of Top Sites in the first place, but I find that if it auto-updates any of the Top Sites that are forum-based, all of the unread topics are marked as read.  So, an even better solution would be the ability to exclude the auto-update of certain URLs/domains, etc.  Does that functionality exist?  <answer48428> If you use Safari's Private Browsing mode, Top Sites will not update at all. However, this solution might not completely address your original question - I haven't found any solution that could turn-off auto-updates of Top Sites, either completely or selectively for certain URLs/domains.  <answer97533> I found this somwhere else which may solve your problem:  ul liQuit Safari/li liOpen Terminal (Applications/Utilities) &amp; paste:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSnapshotsUpdatePolicy -int 2 /code/pre  then hit return &amp; quit Terminal./li /ul  To reactivate:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.Safari DebugSnapshotsUpdatePolicy /code/pre  <answer112554> To disable TopSites, quit Safari, open Terminal and type or paste:  codedefaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSafari4IncludeTopSites false/code  Press Return key. Relaunch Safari.  <comment71950> I don't know of any method of making it *selective*. There is a method for turning it off altogether, and this is chiefly used by people that don't want to have disk space taken up by the huge Top Sites image cache.
