IPhone app to block callers at specific times? <body> Is there an app or any other way on an iPhone 5 to block a given caller at specified times?   Specifically, work keeps calling at all times of the day, every day. Is there a way to send their calls (and not everyone else's) to voicemail on evenings and weekends, but ring normally during working hours?   <answer197300> Do Not Disturb can do that, no 3rd party app needed.  You might have to juggle a new contacts group, because it only allows to receive calls from one group at a time, or favourites - so to exclude 'work' you might need to create a new group containing 'everyone else'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ImvQa.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You can also toggle it manually from the Lock Screen  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WADk8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment235840> https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/call-bliss-silence-calls-text/id575698521?mt=8# may partially solve your problem (I haven't tried it myself). <comment235986> I think this might be the easiest way. The trade-off is that WhatsApp notifications etc would be silenced too but it looks like there's no way around that. Thanks!
