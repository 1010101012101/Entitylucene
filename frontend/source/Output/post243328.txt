iCloud mail sync with outlook 2016 on MAC <body> I have all the latest software - El Capitan, Outlook 2016 fully patched, and an iCloud account that I can log into (from Safari) using either thisIsMe@icloud.com or thisIsMe@gmail.com with thisIsMyPassword.  I setup Mac Outlook 2016 as per web instructions...  precodeE-mail address: thisIsMe@icloud.com User Name: thisIsMe Password:  thisIsMyPassword Incoming Server: imap.mail.me.com:993 (SSL checked) Outgoing Server: smtp.mail.me.com:587 (SSL checked) /code/pre  I have tried everything... sadly no combination of anything makes it all 'just work'. :(   What am I doing wrong?  <answer243361> Solved. The issue was the 2-factor authentication. The solution, go to Manage your Apple ID, Edit by security, create an APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORD..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VzLVR.png" alt="enter image description here"  The rest is self-explanatory. Thank you for your consideration.  <comment299644> What's the actual error? Have you tried using Apple Mail and iCloud Preferences? <comment348866> Thanks for this simple answer. I already started losing my hair to get my account linked.
