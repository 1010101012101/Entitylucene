Comma in 1000 separate in Excel app does not work <body> Even i check the box "use 1000 separate (,)" but nothing is shown in the number. Please Helpimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kqzor.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer219253> In System Preferences  Language &amp; Region, you need to select the Region setting as "United States" instead of "United States (Computer)". You'll need to relaunch Excel after this.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCI4I.png" alt="enter image description here"  This setting is required in Excel 2011 only. In Excel 2016, it works fine.
