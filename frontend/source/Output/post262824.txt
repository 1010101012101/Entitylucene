How can I display the Dock icon for an AppleScript application? <body> I've created an application with AppleScript in Automator. The application is triggered via a system-wide Service. The app basically is a series of dialog lists and buttons that the user selects.  When this app is running, I would like its icon to appear in the Dock, as if the app were a "real" application. Currently, nothing is shown in the Dock whatsoever when the app is run.  I have tried dragging the app file to the Dock, but even while the app resides in the Dock, when I run the app, the black indicator dot never appears.  <comment329276> If what you created was done in Automator as an Application with an AppleScript Action then it will not show in the Dock but as a gear icon in the Apple menu bar. Placing the Automator Application bundle in the Dock isn't going to make it show as a running application in the Dock, only the Apple menu bar while it's running. That's the way it is by design.
