Can't write to Fat32 MicroSD disk <body> I have a disk, it is MicroSD and I have a macbook. I enter said disk into said Macbook and when I try to copy I get...  precode/Volumes/SDCARD/file.img: Read-only file system /code/pre  I tried the ole......  precodesudo chmod - R 777 /Volumes/SDCARD /code/pre  But not luck any ideas?   I also made sure the read-only switch on the adapter wasn't set  emFDisk/em  precodeDisk: /dev/disk2    geometry: 964/64/63 [3887104 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *1: 0B 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [      2048 -    3885056] Win95 FAT-32  2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused     /code/pre  <answer136186> Try remounting the filesystem in read-write mode, using:  precodemount -o update /dev/disk2 /code/pre  <answer136208> The SD Card is failing. Oddly enough, you can mount it as RW using a SDXC  USB adapter (don't ask my why, but it works) strongsuch as this/strong. Once mounted, you can copy data off the card. It's not a question of a corrupted filesystem, but a physical failure of the device - for example, although you emwill be able to reformat the card/em when connected via this adapter, it will nevertheless revert back to read only if connected directly again; it will eventually fail completely. If citations are desired, I don't have any off-hand. My source is personal experience, multiple times over. Best of luck.   strongUpdate (Found an old card):/strong  Here is one of my old, dead 8GB SD cards that is read only when connected via my SDXC port: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ic70m.png" alt="enter image description here" ...And R/W when connected via my USB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GbMnz.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...And finally, immediately after I took these screenshots:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqyAs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment161474> is it encrypted ? <comment161478> Fat32 has a 4GB file-size limit. Could you be hitting this restriction? <comment161484> @Buscarì›ƒ Maybe but I would think I could still reformat or something. <comment161485> @IconDaemon the SD card is only 2GBs. Disk utility won't let me format either. <comment161487> find the disk identifier with `diskutil list` (assuming disk1). what's the output of `sudo fdisk /dev/disk1` ? <comment161491> updated the question with info
