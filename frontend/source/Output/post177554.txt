Does A New Installation Contain Personal Information? <body> I am going to sell my MacBook Air when the new MacBook comes out and so I want to make sure there is no personal Information available to the next user.  I am going to wipe my SSD and reinstall the OS however since I have to download the installer from the App Store will information like my Apple ID be copied onto the computer during the installation?  <answer177556> No, no personal information is stored unless you enter any. If you're performing a clean installation of OS X then simply set it up with a temporary administrator account, no need to sign into iCloud or register etc.  <answer177567> Follow the apple instructions here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065  Download OS X on to bootable USB and reinstall it from there.  This way you do not have to use your Apple ID.  <comment210058> maybe...to be sure download a installer on bootable USB and do it from there, this way the old mac newer saw your Apple ID after disk wipe. <comment210062> That is how I was going to do it. Do you think that Apple will give me any tips on how to make sure there is no data on my old Air when I get the new MacBook? <comment210065> they do here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065  lets make this a answer so you can reward me :) <comment210068> It says on the link you gave me to do all of it from disk utility instead of a bootable USB. So what shall I do? For now I will do what Apple says unless you say different. <comment210070> That is your choice, I would use USB. <comment210072> What is the difference between USB and Disk Utility method from Apple? <comment210076> With Disk utility you have to go online to get (download) the install using your old mac. With USB you do not, thus no record of any kind. <comment210092> Ah, Ok. Then why would Apple suggest that then?
