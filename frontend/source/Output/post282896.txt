Edits to /etc/hosts no longer working <body> I have some edits to my /etc/hosts file that no longer seem to be working.  Specifically:   precode127.0.0.1 facebook.com 127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com /code/pre  These were working a few days (weeks?) ago but no longer do soâ€¦ any advice? I have run codedscacheutil -flushcache/code to no avail.   I am on macOS Sierra 10.12.4 late 2011 MBP   Some detail: I have written a BASH script to copy hosts files based on the time of day as a means to increase my productivity. I have a CRON job running under the superuser to call the script which copies either my strict hosts file or the default one. This was all working fine early last month (April 2017) for sure. I am not certain when it stopped working (probably the last few weeks).  <comment356563> I found https://freedom.to to work better than any `/etc/hosts` hacks :-) <comment356669> /etc/hosts hacks are free though.
