Shrinking extremely large window <body> I have a very large window on Mavericks. The window is so large that I can't seem to get the mouse to the lower right corner to shrink the size of the window. How can I reduce the size of this window? Is there some keyboard shortcut?  <answer157534> If you can see the top left corner of the window, there should be a Red, Yellow and Green circle.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/19GRP.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you click the Green circle, the window should resize so that its entirety is visible.  You can then drag any side or corner to the desired size.    <answer157592> Alternative method, even though the first method works &amp; was accepted as the correct answer... this also works for attached file-picker sheets where you cannot reach the red/yellow/green dots.  Shift/drag any visible edge of a window will simultaneously resize it from all sides except the side opposite to the drag; then enabling you to drag it to a new position.  <comment185222> Can you not get to any edge of the window at all? Mac windows can be shrunk from any edge/corner since a couple of versions. <comment185223> they may be grey... if so, click the one with the + <comment185224> Doh! Pretty sure I had seen that in the past. Knew it must be something simple - thanks! <comment185281> I tried that, it didn't work. Maybe it's particular to my app...
