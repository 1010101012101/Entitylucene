iOS - How can the same company (DUNS) distribute for AppStore AND Enterprise <body> Our company is in the Apple Developer Enterprise Program, and we are doing In-House App Distribution for a while.  Recently, we have decided to start developing for App Store.  According to the Choosing a Membership page in Apple support site, we cannot use our Enterprise Program account for App Store Distribution:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AmTzR.png" alt="enter image description here"  When we tried to open a new "Organization" account, we received the following response:     We've withdrawn this enrollment because ████████ Ltd is already a   member of the Apple Developer Program. Companies may hold only one   membership in the Apple Developer Program.   Is it even possible to keep distributing In-House while also starting AppStore development? Sounds very straightforward, but I found it more difficult than expected.  P.S. I have inherited this "Apple Program Agent" ownership from a former co-worker who didn't really walked my through the details... I'm trying to get my head around how to manage the account, and how to contact Apple Support. So even the smallest clarification on that matter can help.  <comment360669> Please [edit] your question to more clearly indicate the question you need help for. It looks like Apple has already advises you that the same company can't be used for both programs. Have you contacted them about this? <comment360767> What have you tried in the member ship section of https://developer.apple.com/contact/  ? <comment360819> I did a few days ago, still waiting for response. I figured it might be because the AppleID I was using to enroll was from a different domain (not our primary domain). I did the enrollment again with another account. Waiting for this one to go through as well.
