how do I get homebrew build a package (clisp) with the debug flag set <body> Is there a brew --with-debug-flag-set package style command available to get brew to build a package that includes debug information.  Specifically, I would like clisp to be built this way so that disassemble works in the repl.  I imagine something along the lines of:  precodebrew install clisp --with-debug /code/pre  or somesuch.  <answer273645> According to Mike McQuaid (Lead maintainer of Homebrew) this is not possible.
