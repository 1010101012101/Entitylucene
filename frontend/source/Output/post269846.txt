MacBook Pro 11,4 hangs on shutdown <body> I rarely shutdown my MacBook Pro mid 2015 (15 retina) so I really don't know when this began to happen.  When I hit shutdown the screen goes black and the keyboard still lit, and it keeps on forever until I keep pressing the shutdown button on the keyboard to force it to shutdown.  It does it on every circumstance except if I shut it down from the login screen, that way it shuts down correctly.  It does it with any account, even a new one, so I think that it is not something related to user, but a daemon or a process launched when someone logins to the system.  I managed to start the system in verbose mode (cmd + v) but I can't shutdown it in verbose mode (just black screen as usual) and I can't find the codelaunchd-shutdown.log/code anywhere so I can't debug the problem.  The system is updated to the latest version of Sierra, 10.12.2 (16C67).  Does anyone have a suggestion to fix/debug the problem?  I know there are similar question on this site but none of the answers apply to my system/OS.
