Bootcamp no longer a boot option after OS Sierra <body> I installed macOS Sierra on my Late 2011 MacBook Pro and it corrupted my Windows install. I had Windows 10 installed. I did not install this using Boot Camp Assistant. I followed this guide: By Popular Demand: My "Better Than Bootcamp" Guide to Installing Windows 8  Here is the output of codediskutil list/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MabAc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment325521> disk0s2 (Microsoft Reserved Partition (MSR)) has to have the type *E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE* instead of *32xF*. You didn't follow the linked guide literally because you have a 6th unknown partition: disk0s4. Its size mets the size of a Windows Recovery Environment and should show/have the type *DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC*. <comment327547> I did follow the guide. The windows partition functioned properly until I updated to macOS Sierra.
