Apple Mail, how do I hide the Archive folder? <body> I like a very lean Mail system and have been searching for a way to hide the Archive folder in Mail. Is this possible? If so, how?  <answer178076> Simple answer: you can't hide the Archive folder from within the UI, or by any other method so far as I can tell. I haven't poked around in any .plist files or anything, though. Perhaps a .plist spelunker has a handy trick.  <comment210863> This may be the answer, but I am going to hold out for that .plist spelunker.  Thanks.
