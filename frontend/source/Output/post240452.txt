Trouble adding a printer with lpadmin <body> I'm trying to add a printer through the Terminal using lpadmin, and it absolutely refuses to work. The printer adds just fine, everything looks perfect from what I can see, but any attempt to print results in a "Printer did not respond" error.  Here's the line I'm using to add the printer:  precodelpadmin -p _1BIT_16x09 -D 1BIT_16x09 -L "Export" -o printer-is-shared=false -E -v lpd://10.96.99.60/1BIT_16X09 -P ~/PPDs/_1BIT_16x09.ppd /code/pre  The reason the -p name has a _ in front of it is because if I add it normally, it adds this, I'm assuming because the name starts with a number. I have crafted it to create the printer to appear exactly the same way within the cups web interface and the code/etc/cups/printers.conf/code file.  If I add the printer using the above command (which doesn't work), this is what I get in codeprinters.conf/code:  precode&lt;Printer _1BIT_16x09&gt; UUID urn:uuid:13a13ddb-3110-37b0-7aab-96bae9e30955 Info 1BIT_16x09 Location Export MakeModel Agfa ApogeeX DeviceURI lpd://10.96.99.60/1BIT_16X09 State Stopped StateMessage The printer did not respond.

It's driving me bonkers. Any ideas?  <answer240481> I would suspect a permissions issue. I would disable and enable the printer with codecuspdisable/code and codecupsenable/code to see what it returns and what happens then.  <answer242160> The problem, embarrassingly enough, turned out to be an uppercase letter in the lpadmin command I was using.  <comment297382> Nope, that didn't help. I opened a bug report with Apple and they've asked for additional information. Hopefully they'll patch it in an upcoming update. <comment297726> And that uppercase letter in the  command would be...... <comment297727> It was in the queue name. Apparently when I was looking at the printers.conf file it hadn't updated, so I couldn't see the change between upper and lowercase in the 16X09 vs 16x09.
