`rm` and Mac OS X's Versions feature <body> I assume that deleting a file via Finder also deletes any previous versions in code/.DocumentRevisions-V100/code that are attached to that file.  But what's happening if a file is deleted in Terminal with the coderm/code command? Are previous versions left behind or do they actually get deleted, too?  <answer121692> coderm/code just deletes the file(s) specified on the command line. So if you need to delete additonal files from code/.DocumentRevisions-V100/code you need to delete them explicitely as well.
