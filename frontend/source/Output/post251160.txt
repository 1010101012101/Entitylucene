The system works, overall, but I cannot resize the volume, for example and all volume checks end in mysterious errors, like the first one above, for example, which is unnerving.  Need help. TIA.  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013), OS X 10.11.3  <answer251168> You can use the Disk Utility application from the recovery partition to do all of this (unlock and mount the disk, run repair, etc.). If you have any other disk repair utilities maybe give them a shot? Either way, if you don't have a backup already I'd make a copy ASAP.  Another idea is to boot into single user mode (codeCommand-S/code on boot) and run codefsck/code but not sure it'll be any different.  <answer251262> My solution involved:  ul liturning off strongFileVault/strong (I think this was the critical unblocking/enabling factor to move forward with the other tools)/li lirunning codefsck -fy/code in single-user-mode MULTIPLE TIMES until the errors disappeared/li listrongresizing/strong the partition to full disk, by adding another partition in the unused space and then deleting it, grabbing the rest of the space (might not be necessary for you). This involved downsizing the system partition (by accident), but I felt like this might have been a turning point. Note: the resizing took a long time, ~1h, without a good progress indicator or ETA shown./li lirunning codediskutil verifyVolume/repairVolume/code MULTIPLE TIMES until the errors disappeared (might not be necessary)/li /ul  Given the initial re-occurrence of the errors after e.g. fsck (all fixed in the end!), I thought that perhaps this was a hardware problem (e.g. SSD wearing out or something), but I've checked SMART status and it all seems okay. Will keep my eyes open, though.  An important factor was repeating the steps until the errors stop showing and new errors stop appearing. Don't give up. Persistence and "shaking it in various ways" until the cruft is shaken out :). Weird, but worked.  After the errors stopped, I have re-enabled FileVault and the errors did NOT reappear! Yeah.  Also checked with Onyx which previously showed error. Result: no problems found, yeah.  A less mysterious solution could have probably been to reinstall the system from scratch and perhaps restore from backup, but I felt like this would be too much hassle (although might have taken less time really).  <comment312455> Ha! Nice- glad it's working again...
