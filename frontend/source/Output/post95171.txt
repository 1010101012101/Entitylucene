How do I use say command creatively to prank my coworkers/friends? <body> I'm designing a creative / funny prank for OSX via command line. By running in the background, most users would not notice it when she/he first starts using the computer.  Using codesay/code command with creepy voice (codeDeranged/code) is my best bet. Setting volume to very low during saying the sentences is even more creepy! My problem is, I don't know how to grab current current volume to set it to the same volume after codesay/codeing.   precodesascript -e "set Volume 2" say "Naaame I see you" -v Deranged -r 20 sascript -r "set Volume 0" sleep 600 sh thisscript.sh /code/pre  Can I get the current volume and store it in a variable using unix shell scripts?  <answer95220> You could always get the volume, change the volume, say your line, and then restore the volume within the AppleScript:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript set currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings) set volume output volume 1 say "Hello" using "Deranged" set volume output volume currentVolume /code/pre  <comment111607> I'm not so sure this is a good post. This is more of an open-ended subjective post. If you'd like to edit it and make it more objective, that'd be great, but I'm going to vote to close it for now. <comment111608> **I think this question is off topic.**  BUT, I can't resist sharing this: Try fixing a piece of tape to the bottom of the user's mouse. Infared or laser won't pick up the location, so looks like their screen froze. <comment111611> I intent to be ask a open ended question. Just like [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/please-share-your-hidden-os-x-features-or-tips-and-tricks) <comment111613> @Mohsen: personally, I think the question you cite is an exception to the usual AD format. Although it’s open-ended, it’s clear what the value and merit of the question is. I don’t think the same can be said for this one; pranks aren’t especially useful or helpful. <comment111615> As mentioned, this is a list/poll style question that is not as productive or educational as the ones that we have allowed in the past. <comment111619> I would close it if it's not inline with sites values. But pranks are sometimes valuable to users. <comment111627> @Mohsen I love that avatar. Hit us up in [chat] and we might see about a blog post on pranks. I bet we could use the chat rooms to make some discovery and put it on the blog. I'd even help promote the chat room since it's summer and a little fun can't hurt if it's in the right place. Heck, the site owners often do hat contests and such so we could try a new way to have fun, no?
