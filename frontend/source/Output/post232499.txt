Find Files Responsible for Starting Process on Mac <body> While running a local port scan for a troublesome process I discovered a few unknown open ports.  precode Open TCP Port:     106         3com-tsmux  Open TCP Port:     3001        redwood-broker /code/pre  I believe I know what redwood-broker is for, but the other one not so much..  I began by looking up its PID with:  precodesudo lsof -i :106 /code/pre  Then killed it with   precodesudo kill [PID] /code/pre  But it keeps popping up.    strongHow can I find the path to the files responsible for starting this process?/strong  <answer232500> If the process keeps reappearing then most likely it is started by codelaunchd/code. Use launchctl to list jobs loaded to launchd:  precodesudo launchctl list launchctl list /code/pre  Job definitions for launchd in .plist files are stored in:  precode~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user. /Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the administrator. /Library/LaunchDaemons         System-wide daemons provided by the administrator. /System/Library/LaunchAgents   Per-user agents provided by Mac OS X. /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  System-wide daemons provided by Mac OS X. /code/pre  You might also codegrep/code the above files for actual path to executable.  hr  For all processes you can check the output of codeps -ef | grep &lt;process_name&gt;/code and check the parent process codePPID/code.  precode  UID   PID  PPID   C STIME   TTY           TIME CMD   501 17151  7357   0  9:35AM ttys000    0:00.00 grep grep /code/pre  In this example codegrep/code process was spawned from process code7357/code. Later you can check codeps -ef | grep 7357/code to find out it was codebash/code process that started codegrep/code.  <answer232501> Apple uses ports 106 and 3659 for its password service (a SASL-based remote authentication service), which is part of its Open Directory domain service. Shutting down the password service will break large parts of the Open Directory domain service (including local authentication to domain accounts).  If you want Open Directory to work, do not shut this down. On the other hand, if you don't want the Open Directory domain, then turn OD itself off (including the LDAP service and its section of Kerberos). On the gripping hand, if you want to use OD but don't want to unnecessarily expose services, then set up firewall rules to limit access to ports 106 and 3659 (and maybe 88, 389, 636, and 749).  <comment284104> Well, a search engine resulted in this: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202944 <comment284105> Thanks Dave, i actually found the same thing.  I would still like to know how to find the files. <comment284106> Ok i was able to grep the apparent apple process but not the redwood-broker. <comment284107> If it keeps reappearing then most likely `launchd` is responsible for it. But it doesn't mean any process in the system is controlled by it. `ps -ef` and check which process it was spawned from. <comment284108> But how would I find the path to the files responsible for redwood-broker? <comment284109> See above comment: `ps -ef | grep redwood-broker`
