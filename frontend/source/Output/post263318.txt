Help with dual monitor on Macbook pro late 2012 <body> So I recently purchased two external monitors for my MBP 13in. I use something similar to this device (https://www.amazon.com/VicTsing-DisplayPort-thunderbolt-Adapter-Surface/dp/B00JRW3TBY/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480695941&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=thunderbolt+to+vga+and+hdmi) to plug in directly into my laptop thunderbolt port to use the hdmi and vga ports because my MB does not offer regular hdmi ports. I have one monitor connected via hdmi and the other is connected through vga but I have them both plugged in. Only the hdmi monitor works and the vga connected monitor only works if I unplug the hdmi connection. I am not sure it is my monitor settings because the only settings I am offered are PC or AV mode. My monitors are the Samsung 21.5-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitor (S22E310H). Any suggestions to be able to have both screens plugged in and both of them working?  <comment329885> Generally with products like this, the option is either/or, not both. I'd suggest getting a second adapter for the second monitor. You will likely be unable to both monitor displays out at the same time and if you do, you certainly won't be able to do anything other than mirror them. <comment329887> Alright thanks finally found an adapter that might give me what I'm looking for.
