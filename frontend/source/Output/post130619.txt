Safari stopped using keychain <body> Safari 7.0.2 on OS X 10.9.2 stopped using keychain and doesn't remember passwords any more.  That's on my iMac. On my Airbook it still works.  I checked in the keychain application and some of the passwords are stored there and some aren't (but used to be). But Safari is not using any of them.  Any ideas?  <answer130624> strongYou must have already checked that, but just in case, under Safari  Preferences  Passwords make sure that that the AutoFill user names and passwords checkbox is selected./strong  strongIf it does not work and you are using iCloud Keychain :/strongbr On the official Apple Support Website, there is an article about Troubleshooting iCloud Keychain. Here is what it advise you to do :    precodeFirst make sure that your device is currently on a Wi-Fi or cellular network. If the connection appears strong, try these steps:   1. Turn off iCloud Keychain on all devices.  2. Enable iCloud Keychain on the device that has the most up-to-date     keychain items.  3. Enable iCloud Keychain on your other devices. They will be updated with your new iCloud Keychain. /code/pre  strongWhen you enable back iCloud Keychain, DO NOT FORGET to do it — as explained by Apple — on the device with the most up to date version of you list of passwords (in your case it must be your MacBook Air)./strong    Hope it helps.  <comment153204> I don't sync the keychain. But it was what you said I must have already checked. I never unchecked that option (that I can remember) but it was unchecked. I hope it will work again now. <comment153205> @AndrewJ.Brehm Ok cool ! I edited a little bit my answer to take in account the fact that not everybody is using iCloud Keychain.
