Booting Linux USB on 2007 MacBook gives a black screen with a white blinking line <body> I am trying to install linux on a 2007 MacBook (the white one). And everytime I try to boot from a usb or a cd I get a black screen and there is a white horizontal line in the top left which is blinking like in a command prompt but I can't type or do anything there, it stays like that forever until I power it off. I installed rEFIT. I have a usb stick I made with etcher.io with 32bit ubuntu server 16.04 on it but when I try to boot that it says "no bootable medium found - insert disk and press any key" or something in that direction.  Does anyone know how I can solve this problem and install any kind of linux on there?
