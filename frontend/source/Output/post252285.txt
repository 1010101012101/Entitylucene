Is there any way to use backspace/enter natively to go up/down in Finder.app? <body> In macOS, it is hard to constantly press kbd⌘/kbdkbd↑/kbd and kbd⌘/kbdkbd↓/kbd while navigating to go up/down in the folder hierarchy.  Is there any way to natively achieve this in using the kbdBackspace/kbd or kbdEnter/kbd keys respectively instead, without having to rely on third-party program such as Keyboard Mastero? I tried applying a custom shortcut from settings to Finder.app, but it's not possible to apply kbdBackspace/kbd or kbdEnter/kbd as shortcuts at all.  <comment313876> Cmd/up & down aren't 'back & forward' They are Open containing folder & open selected folder. That's not actually the same thing. Back & Forward are Cmd [  & Cmd ] Which do you actually want? All key commands are on https://support.apple.com/HT201236 from which you'll see the Finder is more keyboard navigable than you could ever get from Windows. <comment313877> @Tetsujin You're absolutely right about that – my bad. I meant going up/down in the folder hierarchy. I'll update my post to be clearer. Thanks for the link. It's the Command + Up Arrow, "Open the folder that contains the current folder" shortcut and its opposite counterpart which I am trying to change. <comment313878> BTW, what view are you using - some of the commands change depending on view - for instance in column view, just the arrows will do what you need, in List, then you probably want cmd/square bracket, as above. <comment313879> @Tetsujin Ah, you're right. I do use list view, but the problem is that using the arrow keys to expand folders makes the view become extremely messy. That's why I want to replace the Command keys' functions with the Backspace and Enter keys. <comment313883> In list view, just right & left arrows will open close a folder, Cmd/Opt/ arrow will open or close the entire folder structure below that - a handy one if you were digging deep down a hierarchy & want it all to close.
