Finder takes up so much memory, no windows are open, why? <body> I've noticed that finder is taking 1GB of memory on my mac OS X and it has no open windows at all. Is this a known bug? Anything I can do in order to avoid this ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lRNfp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment321087> How long since the last reboot? Open Terminal & type `uptime`. Does restarting help? <comment321088> If you closed Chromium and all it's "helpers" would that help the issue at all? <comment321089> uptime is 15 days. restarting might help but I rather understand if this is a bug. <comment321092> closing chromium won't reduce finder's memory. it does free lots of memory.. <comment321094> How much memory does Finder use after running `killall Finder` in Terminal? <comment321095> After I managed to close finder process and restart it it takes ~312 MB <comment321108> I just checked a OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 system and upon clean boot Finder is using 28.2 MB of Real Memory with no Finder windows opened. So "~312 MB" is (IMO) still high under the same conditions.
