Script to start my VPN if I'm connected to a specific Network / SSID [El Capitan update] <body> I'm searching an AppleScript to automatically start my University VPN if I'm connected to the University network. I already found some solutions for older OS X Versions, but they're not working anymore on El Capitan.  Edit: An existing solution does not work on El Capitan, I'm getting this error:     Can’t get current configuration of service   id "B7124700-2559-4F93-BC2A-205723054B5B" of network preferences.    System Events got an error: Can’t get current configuration of service id "B7124700-2559-4F93-BC2A-205723054B5B" of network preferences.

Always the same error: System Events got an error: Can’t get current configuration of service id "B71....".... <comment264478> Ah! My mistake. Could you post the full error message in your original question so the answer can be updated? <comment264480> @agentroadkill No problem, done! <comment264487> @blm ControlPlane does not have the function to start / stop VPN. But thank you anyways!! <comment264490> Interesting, older versions do allow controlling the VPN, I used that on Snow Leopard all the time, but it looks like it's been removed. Sorry, should have looked at the latest version before suggesting it.
